  potentials","41 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a model describing the evolution of a tumor inside a host tissue
in terms of the parameters $\varphi_p$, $\varphi_d$ (proliferating and dead
cells, respectively), $u$ (cell velocity) and $n$ (nutrient concentration). The
variables $\varphi_p$, $\varphi_d$ satisfy a Cahn-Hilliard type system with
nonzero forcing term (implying that their spatial means are not conserved in
time), whereas $u$ obeys a form of the Darcy law and $n$ satisfies a
quasistatic diffusion equation. The main novelty of the present work stands in
the fact that we are able to consider a configuration potential of singular
type implying that the concentration vector $(\varphi_p,\varphi_d)$ is
constrained to remain in the range of physically admissible values. On the
other hand, in view of the presence of nonzero forcing terms, this choice gives
rise to a number of mathematical difficulties, especially related to the
control of the mean values of $\varphi_p$ and $\varphi_d$. For the resulting
mathematical problem, by imposing suitable initial-boundary conditions, our
main result concerns the existence of weak solutions in a proper regularity
class.

state-of-the-art results on leaf counting with deep learning methods have

strong annotation). Instead, our method treats leaf counting as a direct
regression problem and thus only requires as annotation the total leaf count
per plant. We argue that combining different datasets when training a deep
neural network is beneficial and improves the results of the proposed approach.
We evaluate our method on the CVPPP 2017 Leaf Counting Challenge dataset, which
contains images of Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. Experimental results show
that the proposed method significantly outperforms the winner of the previous
CVPPP challenge, improving the results by a minimum of ~50% on each of the test
datasets, and can achieve this performance without knowing the experimental
origin of the data (i.e. in the wild setting of the challenge). We also compare

Brownian Dynamics (BD) of two-dimensional periodic suspensions of rigid
particles of complex shape immersed in a Stokes fluid. We develop a novel
approach for generating Brownian displacements that arise in response to the
thermal fluctuations in the fluid. Our approach relies on a first-kind boundary
integral formulation of a mobility problem in which a random surface velocity
is prescribed on the particle surface, with zero mean and covariance
proportional to the Green's function for Stokes flow (Stokeslet). This approach
yields an algorithm that scales linearly in the number of particles for both
deterministic and stochastic dynamics, handles particles of complex shape,
achieves high order of accuracy, and can be generalized to three dimensions and
other boundary conditions. We show that Brownian displacements generated by our
method obey the discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance relation (DFDB). Based
on a recently-developed Positively Split Ewald method [A. M. Fiore, F. Balboa
Usabiaga, A. Donev and J. W. Swan, J. Chem. Phys., 146, 124116, 2017],
near-field contributions to the Brownian displacements are efficiently
approximated by iterative methods in real space, while far-field contributions
are rapidly generated by fast Fourier-space methods based on fluctuating
hydrodynamics. FBIM provides the key ingredient for time integration of the
overdamped Langevin equations for Brownian suspensions of rigid particles. We
demonstrate that FBIM obeys DFDB by performing equilibrium BD simulations of
suspensions of starfish-shaped bodies using a random finite difference temporal
integrator.

remotely change the crystal curvature, it was possible to study the steering
capability of planar channeling and volume reflection vs. the curvature radius
and the atomic number, Z. For silicon, the channeling efficiency exceeds 35 %,
a record for negatively charged particles. This was possible due to the
realization of a crystal with a thickness of the order of the dechanneling
length. On the other hand, for germanium the efficiency is slightly below 10 %
due to the stronger contribution of multiple scattering for a higher-Z
material. Nevertheless this is the first evidence of negative beam steering by
planar channeling in a Ge crystal. Having determined for the first time the

Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media
platforms, a point of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and
filter bubbles, caused by social homophily and algorithmic personalization.
  In this paper we address the problem of balancing the information exposure in
a social network. We assume that two opposing campaigns (or viewpoints) are
present in the network, and that network nodes have different preferences
towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in the
respective campaigns, so that the overall information exposure for the two
campaigns is balanced. We formally define the problem, characterize its
hardness, develop approximation algorithms, and present experimental evaluation
results.
  Our model is inspired by the literature on influence maximization, but we
offer significant novelties. First, balance of information exposure is modeled
by a symmetric difference function, which is neither monotone nor submodular,
and thus, not amenable to existing approaches. Second, while previous papers
consider a setting with selfish agents and provide bounds on best response
strategies (i.e., move of the last player), we consider a setting with a
centralized agent and provide bounds for a global objective function.

physical stimuli such as the mass of an added molecule. To map out the local
shape properties of the physical stimuli, such as the distribution of the mass
density of a molecule, sensory information should be collected through multiple
modes of a mechanical sensor. By utilizing the specific mode shapes, the
spatial distribution of a physical stimulus can be reverse calculated. However,
the mode shapes of a sensor may deviate from their ideal forms once analytes
start to accumulate on the sensor. As a result, algorithms based on the ideal
form of the mode shapes no longer work accurately. Here, we developed a
theoretical framework to calculate the change in the mode shapes of a
nanomechanical beam after analyte adsorption. We verified the theoretical model
by performing finite element simulations and comparing the change in the mode
shapes obtained from each approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to
relate the maximum deviation in the mode shapes to the surface roughness of the
sensor after analyte accumulation. By predicting the change in the mode shapes
and using the corrected forms, the accuracy of the nanomechanical sensing can
be improved significantly.

and KIC 11175495.
  Aims. The goal is to study the pulsational characteristics of the oscillating
stars of the systems as well as to estimate their absolute parameters and
enrich the so far poor sample of this kind of systems.
  Methods. Ground based spectroscopic observations provide the means to
estimate the spectral types of the primary components and to model the light
curves with higher certainty. The photometric data are analysed using eclipsing
binary modeling techniques, while Fourier analysis is applied on their
residuals in order to reveal the pulsation frequency modes.
  Results. The results of analyses show that the primaries are pulsating stars
of delta Scuti type and that all systems belong to the group of Algol type
binaries with an oscillating star, namely oEA stars. The primaries of KIC
06669809, KIC 10581918, and KIC 10619109 pulsate in three, two, and five
frequencies, respectively and in more than 200 other detected as combinations.
The delta Scuti star of KIC 11175495 is the youngest and the fastest pulsator
in binary systems that has ever been found and it oscillates in three main non
radial frequencies, while other 153 are also found as depended ones. Moreover,
a comparison of their properties with other systems of the same type as well as
with theoretical models of pulsating stars are also presented and discussed.

safe to say that we do not explicitly measure depths to every visible surface

Similarly, we do not extrude the 2D geometry present in the floorplan into 3D

  Humans do the exact opposite. Instead of depth, we use high level semantic

collapse the 3D world into a 2D representation. Evidence of this is that many
of the floorplans we use in everyday life are not accurate, opting instead for
high levels of discriminative landmarks.
  In this work, we use this insight to present a global localisation approach

inelastic collisions). These quantities, for both the models, exhibit power-law
behavior, at least in the long time limit. For the BAM, corresponding exponents
exhibit strong dimension dependence and follow a hyperscaling relation. In
addition, in the high packing fraction limit the behavior of these quantities
become consistent with a scaling theory that predicts an inverse relation
between energy and mass. On the other hand, in the case of the GGM we do not
find any evidence for such a picture. In this case, even though the energy
decay, irrespective of packing fraction, matches quantitatively with that for
the high packing fraction picture of the BAM, it is inversely proportional to
the growth of mass only in one dimension, and the growth appears to be rather
insensitive to the choice of the dimension, unlike the BAM.

(M5e), a visual pair of late-type, young stellar objects lying near the apex of
the nebula, demonstrates that while both are variable, the former has
brightened by more than two magnitudes following a deep local minimum in
September 2014. Keck high dispersion (R$\sim$45,000-66,000), optical
spectroscopy of HBC 340 suggests that the protostar is a spectroscopic binary
(HBC 340Aa + HBC 340Ab). Both HBC 340 and HBC 341 exhibit strong H$\alpha$ and
forbidden line emission, consistent with accretion and outflow. We conclude
that the brightness fluctuations in the reflection nebula represent light echos
produced by varying incident radiation emanating from HBC 340. The short-term
variability observed in the protostar is attributed to irregular accretion
activity, while correlated, dipping behavior on a several hundred day time
scale may be due to eclipse-like events caused by orbiting circumstellar
material. Archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the region reveals a
second, faint (F814W$\sim$20.3 mag) companion to HBC 340 that lies 1.02""
($\sim$235 AU) east of the protostar. If associated, this probable substellar
mass object (20-50 Jupiter masses), HBC 340B, is likely unrelated to the
observed brightness variations. The sustained brightening of HBC 340 since late
2014 can be explained by an EXor-like outburst, the recovery from a long
duration eclipse event caused by obscuring circumstellar dust, or by the
gradual removal of extincting material from along the line of sight. Our
analysis here favors one of the extinction scenarios.

optical conductivity of SmB$_6$ is shown to possess distinct regimes of either
dominant free carrier or $localized$ response contributions. The free carrier

distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. The goals were to make the two
communities more familiar between each other, review developments from both
sides, and set precision targets for lattice calculations so that they can
contribute, together with the forthcoming experimental input, to the next
generation of PDF determinations. This contribution summarises the relevant
outcome of the workshop, in anticipation of a thorough white paper.

important to develop as many independent methods as possible to understand the

Here, we show that we are now ready to move beyond low redshifts and attempt
high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 0.3$) SN~II cosmology as a result of new-generation
deep surveys such as the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. Applying the
""standard candle method"" to SN$\sim$2016jhj ($z=0.3398 \pm 0.0002$; discovered

time-delay distance $D_{\Delta t}$, and thus the Hubble constant $H_0$ and
other cosmological parameters. Stellar kinematics of the deflector galaxy play
an essential role in this measurement by: (i) helping break the mass-sheet
degeneracy; (ii) determining in principle the angular diameter distance $D_{\rm
d}$ to the deflector and thus further improving the cosmological constraints.
In this paper we simulate observations of lensed quasars with integral field
spectrographs and show that spatially resolved kinematics of the deflector
enable further progress by helping break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy.
Furthermore, we use our simulations to obtain realistic error estimates with
current/upcoming instruments like OSIRIS on Keck and NIRSPEC on the James Webb
Space Telescope for both distances (typically $\sim6$ per cent on $D_{\Delta
t}$ and $\sim10$ per cent on $D_{\rm d}$). We use the error estimates to
compute cosmological forecasts for the sample of nine lenses that currently
have well measured time delays and deep Hubble Space Telescope images and for a
sample of 40 lenses that is projected to be available in a few years through
follow-up of candidates found in ongoing wide field surveys. We find that $H_0$
can be measured with 2 per cent (1 per cent) precision from nine (40) lenses in
a flat $\Lambda$cold dark matter cosmology. We study several other cosmological
models beyond the flat $\Lambda$cold dark matter model and find that time-delay

first study how the star-formation budget in galaxies with stellar masses
greater than $\log (\textrm{M}_{*}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) = 10$ splits as a
function of each parameter separately. We then explore how the budget behaves

galaxies, that reside in the field, and have stellar masses between $10 < \log

formation budget hosted by galaxies in the field, groups and clusters is
21:3:1. Morphological ellipticals are minority contributors to local star
formation. They make a measurable contribution to the star formation budget
only at intermediate to high stellar masses, $10.3< \log

number), and typically in the field, where they contribute up to $\sim$13 per
cent of the total star-formation budget. This inventory of local star formation
serves as a $z\sim0$ baseline which, when combined with similar work at high

which the observational uncertainties and selection effects (photometric,
surface gravity and effective temperature) are taken into account. We compare a
`solar neighbourhood analogue' region in a model Milky Way-like galaxy
simulated with RAMSES-CH with fourth release Gaia-ESO survey data. We find that
a simple spatial cut alone is insufficient and that observational uncertainties
must be accounted for in the comparison. This is particularly true when the
scale of uncertainty is large compared to the dynamic range of the data, e.g.
in our comparison, the [Mg/Fe] distribution is affected much more than the more
accurately determined [Fe/H] distribution. Despite clear differences in the
underlying distributions of elemental abundances between simulation and
observation, incorporating scatter to our simulation results to mimic
observational uncertainty produces reasonable agreement. The quite complete
nature of the Gaia-ESO survey means that the selection function has minimal
impact on the distribution of observed age and metal abundances but this would
become increasingly more important for surveys with narrower selection
functions.

noise is a common problem in astrophysics. Examples include source detection in
X-ray images, gamma-rays, UV, neutrinos, and search for clusters of galaxies
and stellar streams. However, the solutions in the X-ray-related literature are
sub-optimal -- in some cases by considerable factors. Using the lemma of
Neyman-Pearson we derive the optimal statistics for template detection in the
presence of Poisson noise. We demonstrate that this method provides higher
completeness, for a fixed false-alarm probability value, compared with
filtering the image with the point-spread function (PSF). In turn, we find that
filtering by the PSF is better than filtering the image using the Mexican-hat
wavelet (used by wavedetect). For some background levels, our method improves
the sensitivity of source detection by more than a factor of two over the
popular Mexican-hat wavelet filtering. This filtering technique can also be
used also for fast PSF photometry and flare detection, and it is efficient, as
well as straight forward to implement. We provide an implementation in MATLAB.

supergiant with T ~ 20000 K, a dense wind, substantial circumstellar
extinction, and a G-type supergiant companion. The hot star progenitor of V12's
giant eruption was likely in the post-red supergiant stage and had already shed
a lot of mass. V37 is a classical LBV/S Dor variable. Our photometry and
spectra observed during and after its eruption show that its outburst was an
apparent transit on the HR Diagram due to enhanced mass loss and the formation
of a cooler, dense wind. V37 is an evolved hot supergiant at ~10^6 Lsun with a
probable initial mass of 60 -80 Msun.

means of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on the radiation

scatterings are taken into account. We compare the calculated spectra of
accretion flow around black holes with masses of $M_{\rm BH} = 10, 10^2, 10^3$,
and $10^4 M_\odot$ for a fixed mass injection rate (from the computational
boundary at $10^3 r_{\rm s}$) of $10^3 L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ (with $r_{\rm s}$,
$L_{\rm Edd}$, and $c$ being the Schwarzschild radius, the Eddington
luminosity, and the speed of light, respectively). The soft X-ray spectra
exhibit mass dependence in accordance with the standard-disk relation; the
maximum surface temperature is scaled as $T \propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/4}$. The
spectra in the hard X-ray bands, by contrast, look quite similar among
different models, if we normalize the radiation luminosity by $M_{\rm BH}$.
This reflects that the hard component is created by thermal and bulk Compton
scattering of soft photons originating from an accretion flow in the
over-heated and/or funnel regions, the temperatures of which have no mass
dependence. The hard X-ray spectra can be reproduced by a Wien spectrum with
temperature of $T\sim 3$ keV accompanied by a hard excess at photon energy
above several keV. The excess spectrum can be well fitted with a power law with
a photon index of $\Gamma \sim 3$. This feature is in good agreement with that
of the recent NuSTAR observations of ULX (Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources).

for recommendation. Existing methods mainly assume that all time steps in
user-item interaction history are equally relevant to recommendation, which
however does not apply in real-world scenarios where user-item interactions can
often happen accidentally. More importantly, they learn user and item dynamics
separately, thus failing to capture their joint effects on user-item
interactions. To better model user and item dynamics, we present the
Interacting Attention-gated Recurrent Network (IARN) which adopts the attention
model to measure the relevance of each time step. In particular, we propose a
novel attention scheme to learn the attention scores of user and item history
in an interacting way, thus to account for the dependencies between user and
item dynamics in shaping user-item interactions. By doing so, IARN can
selectively memorize different time steps of a user's history when predicting
her preferences over different items. Our model can therefore provide
meaningful interpretations for recommendation results, which could be further
enhanced by auxiliary features. Extensive validation on real-world datasets
shows that IARN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

upper bounds on the state with the greatest ""mass-to-charge"" ratio in such

and the charge of the weakest charged state in the theory. We apply the
extremal functional method to theories that saturate such bounds, and in
several cases we find the resulting prediction for the occupation numbers are
precisely integers. Because such theories sometimes do not saturate a bound on
the full space of states but do saturate a bound in the neutral sector of

solve for some partition functions that would not be accessible to it

In order to reveal the physical origin, we conducted a combined theoretical and
experimental investigation. First, we established the ground state geometry of
the clusters by comparing the experimental vibrational spectra with those

the relative spectral efficiencies of eight telescopes in steps of 5 nm from

monochromator. Different sets of telescopes in the observatory have different
optical components, and the eight telescopes measured represent two each of the
four combinations of components represented in the observatory. We made an
end-to-end measurement of the response from different combinations of optical
components, and the monochromator setup allowed for more precise and complete
measurements than our previous multi-wavelength calibrations. We find an
overall uncertainty in the calibration of the spectral response of most of the
telescopes of 1.5% for all wavelengths; the six oldest telescopes have larger
overall uncertainties of about 2.2%. We also report changes in physics
measureables due to the change in calibration, which are generally small.

systems considering a network-preserving model with nonlinear power flows and
excitation voltage dynamics. Salient features of the proposed distributed
control strategy are fourfold: i) nonlinearity is considered to cope with large
disturbances; ii) only a part of generators are controllable; iii) no load
measurement is required; iv) communication connectivity is required only for
the controllable generators. To this end, benefiting from the concept of
'virtual load demand', we first design the distributed controller for the
controllable generators by leveraging the primal-dual decomposition technique.
We then propose a method to estimate the virtual load demand of each
controllable generator based on local frequencies. We derive incremental
passivity conditions for the uncontrollable generators. Finally, we prove that
the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and its equilibrium attains the
optimal solution to the associated economic dispatch problem. Simulations,
including small and large-disturbance scenarios, are carried on the New England

galaxy compactness, possibly connected via extreme active galactic nucleus
(AGN) feedback at early times ($z > 2$). In our picture, AGN feedback is driven
by radiation pressure on dust. We suggest that early UMBH feedback blows away
all the gas beyond a $\sim$kpc or so, while triggering star formation at inner
radii, eventually leaving a compact galaxy remnant. Such extreme UMBH feedback
can also affect the surrounding environment on larger scales, e.g. the
outflowing stars may form a diffuse stellar halo around the compact galaxy, or
even escape into the intergalactic or intracluster medium. On the other hand,
less massive black holes will drive less powerful feedback, such that the stars
formed within the AGN feedback-driven outflow remain bound to the host galaxy,
and contribute to its size growth over cosmic time.

column density is log N(HI) = 19.6-19.7 at both locations across the lens,
comparable to what is seen in 21 cm images of nearby ellipticals. The HI gas
kinematics are well-matched with the kinematics of the FeII absorption complex

abundances to solar or supersolar, similar to those of the hot ISM and stars of

infer a total Fe mass of M_cool(Fe)~(5-8)x10^4 M_sun in the cool ISM of the

  As-You-Go Deployment of Wireless Relay Networks along a Line",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We are motivated by the need for impromptu (or as-you-go) deployment of
multihop wireless networks, by human agents or robots; the agent moves along a
line, makes wireless link quality measurements at regular intervals, and makes
on-line placement decisions using these measurements. As a first step, we have
formulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In
our earlier work, we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure
as-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii)
the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few
successive steps and then selects the best relay placement location. The latter
was shown to provide better performance but at the expense of more measurements
and deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick
deployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, the
deployment algorithm should not require prior knowledge of the parameters of
the wireless propagation model. In [1] we, therefore, developed learning
algorithms for the explore-forward approach.
  The current paper provides deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go
approach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an average
cost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption,
link outage probabilities, and the number of deployed relay nodes. First we
show structural results for the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the special
structure of the optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronous
stochastic approximation, we develop two learning algorithms that
asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deployment
progresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, and
hence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment of
emergency wireless networks.

named entities in sentences, actions in videos, occur frequently in sequence
prediction problems. Segmental models, a class of models that explicitly
hypothesizes segments, have allowed the exploration of rich segment features
for sequence prediction. However, segmental models suffer from slow decoding,
hampering the use of computationally expensive features.
  In this thesis, we introduce discriminative segmental cascades, a multi-pass
inference framework that allows us to improve accuracy by adding higher-order
features and neural segmental features while maintaining efficiency. We also
show that instead of including more features to obtain better accuracy,
segmental cascades can be used to speed up training and decoding.
  Segmental models, similarly to conventional speech recognizers, are typically
trained in multiple stages. In the first stage, a frame classifier is trained
with manual alignments, and then in the second stage, segmental models are
trained with manual alignments and the out- puts of the frame classifier.
However, obtaining manual alignments are time-consuming and expensive. We
explore end-to-end training for segmental models with various loss functions,
and show how end-to-end training with marginal log loss can eliminate the need
for detailed manual alignments.
  We draw the connections between the marginal log loss and a popular
end-to-end training approach called connectionist temporal classification. We
present a unifying framework for various end-to-end graph search-based models,
such as hidden Markov models, connectionist temporal classification, and
segmental models. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of segmental models
to large-vocabulary sequence prediction tasks.

mechanical data including normal force and torque were measured and used to
calculate the friction coefficient. After each rotation increment, a ${\mu}$CT
scan was conducted to observe the sample structure. The careful and
quantitative ${\mu}$CT image analysis allowed for direct and continuous
observation of the fault evolution. We observed that fracturing due to asperity
interlocking and breakage dominated the initial phase of slipping. The
frictional behavior stabilized after ~1 mm slip distance, which inferred the
critical slip distance. We developed a novel approach to estimate the real
contact area on the fault surface by means of ${\mu}$CT image analysis. Real
contact area varied with increased shear distances as the contacts between
asperities changed, and it eventually stabilized at approximately 12% of the
nominal fault area. The dimension of the largest contact patch on the surface
was close to observed critical slip distance, suggesting that the frictional
behavior may be controlled by contacting large asperities. These observations
improved our understanding of fault evolution and associated friction
variation. Moreover, this work demonstrates that the ${\mu}$CT technology is a
powerful tool for the study of earthquake physics.

information derived from a photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithm, SPIDERz,
to identify potential catastrophic outliers in photometric redshift

photometry spanning a wide redshift range (0<z<4) matched with reliable
spectroscopic or other redshift determinations we explore the efficacy of a
novel method to flag potential catastrophic outliers in an analysis which
relies on accurate photometric redshifts. SPIDERz is a custom support vector
machine classification algorithm for photo-z analysis that naturally outputs a
distribution of redshift probability information for each galaxy in addition to
a discrete most probable photo-z value. By applying an analytic technique with
flagging criteria to identify the presence of probability distribution features
characteristic of catastrophic outlier photo-z estimates, such as multiple
redshift probability peaks separated by substantial redshift distances, we can
flag potential catastrophic outliers in photo-z determinations. We find that
our proposed method can correctly flag large fractions (>50%) of the
catastrophic outlier galaxies, while only flagging a small fraction (<5%) of
the total non-outlier galaxies, depending on parameter choices. The fraction of
non-outlier galaxies flagged varies significantly with redshift and magnitude,
however. We examine the performance of this strategy in photo-z determinations
using a range of flagging parameter values. These results could potentially be
useful for utilization of photometric redshifts in future large scale surveys
where catastrophic outliers are particularly detrimental to the science goals.

network versions of consistency and no unobserved confounding, inference is
made tractable by an assumption that the network's outcome, treatment and
covariate vectors are a single realization of a certain chain graph model. This
assumption allows inferences about various network causal effects via the
auto-g-computation algorithm, a network generalization of Robins' well-known
g-computation algorithm previously described for causal inference under

images. Although a large number of metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods have
been proposed in the past decades, MAR is still one of the major problems in
clinical x-ray CT. In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network
(CNN) based open MAR framework, which fuses the information from the original
and corrected images to suppress artifacts. The proposed approach consists two
phases. In the CNN training phase, we build a database consisting of
metal-free, metal-inserted and pre-corrected CT images, and image patches are
extracted and used for CNN training. In the MAR phase, the uncorrected and
pre-corrected images are used as the input of the trained CNN to generate a CNN
image with reduced artifacts. To further reduce the remaining artifacts, water
equivalent tissues in a CNN image are set to a uniform value to yield a CNN
prior, whose forward projections are used to replace the metal-affected
projections, followed by the FBP reconstruction. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is validated on both simulated and real data. Experimental
results demonstrate the superior MAR capability of the proposed method to its
competitors in terms of artifact suppression and preservation of anatomical
structures in the vicinity of metal implants.

isotope ratios depend primarily on reacceleration, we find here that the ratio
also depends on the halo size ($z_\mathrm{h}$) and in spiral-arms models also
on the time since the last spiral arm passage ($\tau_\mathrm{arm}$). Namely, EC
isotopes can in principle provide interesting constraints on the diffusion
geometry. However, with the present uncertainties in the lab measurements of
both the electron attachment rate and the fragmentation cross-sections, no
meaningful constraint can be placed.

proximity to active regions. This is the first report that full-disk
observations, including center-to-limb variations, reproduce the photometric
properties of faculae and network observed previously only in sub-arcsecond
resolution, small field-of-view studies, i.e. that network, as defined by
distance from active regions, exhibit higher photometric contrasts.
Specifically, for magnetic flux values larger than approximately 300 G, the
network is brighter than faculae and the contrast differences increases toward
the limb, where the network contrast is about twice the facular one. For lower
magnetic flux values, network appear darker than faculae. Contrary to reports
from previous full-disk observations, we also found that network exhibits a
higher center-to-limb variation. Our results are in agreement with reports from
simulations that indicate magnetic flux alone is a poor proxy of the
photometric properties of magnetic features. We estimate that the contribution
of faculae and network to Total Solar Irradiance variability of the current
Cycle 24 is overestimated by at least 11\% due to the photometric properties of
network and faculae not being recognized as different. This estimate is
specific to the method employed in this study to reconstruct irradiance
variations, so caution should be paid when extending it to other techniques.

errors of the mean are 16.2 km/s (2014) and 5.4 km/s (2016), confirming the
reliability of our measurements. The difference between the RVs estimated by
Newtonian mechanics and general relativity will reach about 200 km/s near the

diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on neuroimaging data. Most existing
studies have been focusing on binary classification problems, e.g.,
distinguishing AD patients from normal control (NC) elderly or mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) individuals from NC elderly. However, identifying individuals
with AD and MCI, especially MCI individuals who will convert to AD (progressive

distinguishing NC, stable MCI (sMCI), pMCI, and AD at an individual subject
level, taking into account the inherent ordinal severity of brain degeneration
caused by normal aging, MCI, and AD, rather than formulating the classification
as a multi-category classification problem. The proposed deep ordinal ranking
model focuses on the hippocampal morphology of individuals and learns
informative and discriminative features automatically. Experiment results based
on a large cohort of individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging

performance than traditional multi-category classification techniques using
shape and radiomics features from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

exceedingly large fluctuations. These waves are unusual because their
properties are controlled by both the leading edge and the bulk of the front.

leverage the strengths of different existing classifiers for supervised
multi-label image segmentation. Unlike previous works that simply aggregate or
cascade classifiers for addressing image segmentation and labeling tasks, we
propose to embed strong classifiers into a tree structure that allows
bi-directional flow of information between its classifier nodes to gradually
improve their performances. Our DMT is a generic classification model that
inherently embeds different cascades of classifiers while enhancing learning
transfer between them to boost up their classification accuracies.
Specifically, each node in our DMT can nest a Structured Random Forest (SRF)
classifier or a Bayesian Network (BN) classifier. The proposed SRF-BN DMT
architecture has several appealing properties. First, while SRF operates at a
patch-level (regular image region), BN operates at the super-pixel level
(irregular image region), thereby enabling the DMT to integrate multi-level
image knowledge in the learning process. Second, although BN is powerful in
modeling dependencies between image elements (superpixels, edges) and their
features, the learning of its structure and parameters is challenging. On the

The proposed DMT robustly overcomes these limitations for both classifiers
through the ascending and descending flow of contextual information between
each parent node and its children nodes. Third, we train DMT using different
scales, where we progressively decrease the patch and superpixel sizes as we go
deeper along the tree edges nearing its leaf nodes. Last, DMT demonstrates its
outperformance in comparison to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods
for multi-labeling of brain images with gliomas.

unambiguously larger than that of Mercury, the Moon, and another near-Earth

threat to privacy. A growing body of prior work demonstrates that models
produced by these algorithms may leak specific private information in the
training data to an attacker, either through the models' structure or their
observable behavior. However, the underlying cause of this privacy risk is not
well understood beyond a handful of anecdotal accounts that suggest overfitting
and influence might play a role.
  This paper examines the effect that overfitting and influence have on the
ability of an attacker to learn information about the training data from
machine learning models, either through training set membership inference or
attribute inference attacks. Using both formal and empirical analyses, we
illustrate a clear relationship between these factors and the privacy risk that
arises in several popular machine learning algorithms. We find that overfitting
is sufficient to allow an attacker to perform membership inference and, when
the target attribute meets certain conditions about its influence, attribute
inference attacks. Interestingly, our formal analysis also shows that
overfitting is not necessary for these attacks and begins to shed light on what
other factors may be in play. Finally, we explore the connection between
membership inference and attribute inference, showing that there are deep
connections between the two that lead to effective new attacks.

photospheric magnetogram serves as observational input in the fluid approach to
extrapolate the heliospheric magnetic field. Then semi-empirical coronal models
are used for estimating the plasma characteristics up to a heliocentric
distance of 0.1AU. From there on a full MHD model which computes the
three-dimensional time-dependent evolution of the solar wind macroscopic
variables up to the orbit of the Earth is used. After interfacing the density
and velocity at the inner MHD boundary, we compare with the results of a
kinetic exospheric solar wind model based on the assumption of Maxwell and
Kappa velocity distribution functions for protons and electrons respectively,
as well as with \textit{in situ} observations at 1AU. This provides insight on
more physically detailed processes, such as coronal heating and solar wind
acceleration, that naturally arise by inclusion of suprathermal electrons in
the model. We are interested in the profile of the solar wind speed and density
at 1AU, in characterizing the slow and fast source regions of the wind and in
comparing MHD with exospheric models in similar conditions. We calculate the

than for the one-dimensional SDEs. Precisely, we shall prove that when $m=1$

(AB - h/e) oscillations are found to be dominant, contingent upon the surface
confinement of electrons in the nanowire. We also numerically study disordered
nanowires of finite length, bridging a gap in the existing literature. By
varying the nanowire length and disorder strength, we identify the transition
where Al'tshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS - h/2e) oscillations start dominating,
noting the effects of considering an open system. Moreover, we demonstrate how
the relative magnitudes of the scattering length and the device dimensions
govern the relative dominance of these harmonics with energy, revealing that
the AAS oscillations emerge and start dominating from the center of the band,
much higher in energy than the conduction band-edge. We also show the ways of
suppressing the oscillatory components (AB and AAS) to observe the
non-oscillatory weak localization corrections, noting the interplay of
scattering, incoherence/dephasing, the geometry of electronic distribution, and
orientation of magnetic field. This is followed by a study of surface roughness
which shows contrasting effects depending on its strength and type, ranging
from magnetic depopulation to strong AAS oscillations. Subsequently, we show
that dephasing causes a progressive degradation of the higher harmonics,
explaining the re-emergence of the AB component even in long and disordered
nanowires. Lastly, we show that our model qualitatively reproduces the
experimental magneto-conductance spectrum in [Holloway et al, PRB 91, 045422

spatial-correlations in the disorder potential, and dephasing.

  http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~pyadolla/papers/thesis.pdf",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic image segmentation is an important computer vision task that is
difficult because it consists of both recognition and segmentation. The task is
often cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large
output-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The
best segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution
over the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in
optimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a
trade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order
interactions between image elements at the cost of inaccurate and possibly
intractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less
accurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of
its output distribution.
  This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to
semantic segmentation. In the first stage a tractable segmentation model
outputs a set of high probability segmentations from the underlying
distribution that are not just minor perturbations of each other. Critically
the output of this stage is a diverse set of plausible solutions and not just a
single one. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model
selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much
more complex features than what could be tractably used in the segmentation
model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than simply
returning the MAP solution. The formulation is agnostic to the underlying
segmentation model (e.g. CRF, CNN, etc.) and optimization algorithm, which
makes it applicable to a wide range of models and inference methods. Evaluation
of the approach on a number of semantic image segmentation benchmark datasets
highlight its superiority over inferring the MAP solution.

a wide-spread phenomenon in nature, yet there are only a few experimentally

Here we report the discovery that a magnetic-field-driven QPT in
superconducting nanowires - a prototypical 1d-system - can be fully explained
by the critical theory of pair-breaking transitions characterized by a
correlation length exponent $\nu \approx 1$ and dynamic critical exponent $z

conductivity is in agreement with a theoretically predicted scaling function
and, moreover, that the theory quantitatively describes the dependence of
conductivity on the critical temperature, field magnitude and orientation,
nanowire cross sectional area, and microscopic parameters of the nanowire
material. At the critical field, the conductivity follows a $T^{(d-2)/z}$
dependence predicted by phenomenological scaling theories and more recently
obtained within a holographic framework. Our work uncovers the microscopic
processes governing the transition: The pair-breaking effect of the magnetic
field on interacting Cooper pairs overdamped by their coupling to electronic
degrees of freedom. It also reveals the universal character of continuous

consider in this work for the matter inside white dwarfs two equations of
state, frequently found in the literature, namely, the Chandrasekhar and
Salpeter equations of state. We find that using Newtonian equilibrium
equations, the radii of massive white dwarfs ($M>1.3M_{\odot}$) are
overestimated in comparison with GR outcomes. For a mass of $1.415M_{\odot}$
the white dwarf radius predicted by GR is about 33\% smaller than the Newtonian
one. Hence, in this case, for the surface gravity the difference between the
general relativistic and Newtonian outcomes is about 65\%. We depict the

the way that one must implement asymmetric inflation to satisfy the limits of

The resulting degenerate elliptic integer order PDE is then approximated using
a hybrid FEM-spectral scheme. Finite elements are used in the direction

used in the extruded direction. The spectral part of the scheme requires that
we approximate the true eigenvalues of the integer order Laplacian over

arising from using an approximation in place of the true eigenvalues. We
further present a strategy for choosing approximations of the eigenvalues based
on Weyl's law and finite element discretizations of the eigenvalue problem. The
system of linear algebraic equations arising from the hybrid FEM-spectral

dissipation is expected to take place in the envelopes of Jovian and lower-mass
planets alike. While the process has been investigated on the former, there
have been no studies done on mini-Neptunes so far. From structure and thermal
evolution models, we determine that the required energy deposition for halting
the contraction of mini-Neptunes increases with planetary mass and envelope
fraction. Scaled to the insolation power, the ohmic heating needed is small
$\sim10^{-5}$ -- orders of magnitude lower than for exo-Jupiters $\sim
10^{-2}$. Conversely, from solving the magnetic induction equation, we find
that ohmic energy is dissipated more readily for lower-mass planets and those
with larger envelope fractions. Combining these two trends, we find that ohmic
dissipation in hot mini-Neptunes is strong enough to inflate their radii ($\sim
10^{15}$ W for $T_{eq}=1400K$). The implication is that the radii of hot
mini-Neptunes may be attributed in part to ohmic heating. Thus, there is a
trade-off between ohmic dissipation and H/He content for hot mini-Neptunes,
adding a new degeneracy for the interpretation of the composition of such
planets. In addition, ohmic dissipation would make mini-Neptunes more
vulnerable to atmospheric evaporation.

evolution in InAs/GaSb quantum wells is revealed: the electron subbands cross
the heavy hole subbands but anticross the light hole subbands. The
topologically protected band crossing point (Dirac point) of the helical edge
states is pulled to be close to and even buried in the bulk valence bands when
the system is in a deeply inverted regime, which is attributed to the existence
of the light hole subbands. A sizable Zeeman energy gap verified by the
effective g-factors of edge states opens at the Dirac point by an in-plane or
perpendicular magnetic field, however it can also be hidden in the bulk valance

homogeneous way: circular polarisation, chromospheric features, and Zeeman
broadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex relationship between these
activity indicators is analysed: while no strong connection is found between
the large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the
non-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere.
  We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the
optical radial-velocity jitter available in the literature, especially for
planet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit
function (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most
favorable stars where the radial-velocity jitter is low enough for planet
searches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the
large-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission.

active research field in the past decade. However, most existing works use
percolation-based models where only the largest component of each network
remains functional throughout the cascade. Although suitable for communication
networks, this assumption fails to capture the dependencies in systems carrying
a flow (e.g., power systems, road transportation networks), where cascading
failures are often triggered by redistribution of flows leading to overloading
of lines. Here, we consider a model consisting of systems $A$ and $B$ with
initial line loads and capacities given by $\{L_{A,i},C_{A,i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and
$\{L_{B,i},C_{B,i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$, respectively. When a line fails in system $A$,
$a$-fraction of its load is redistributed to alive lines in $B$, while
remaining $(1-a)$-fraction is redistributed equally among all functional lines
in $A$; a line failure in $B$ is treated similarly with $b$ giving the fraction
to be redistributed to $A$. We give a thorough analysis of cascading failures
of this model initiated by a random attack targeting $p_1$-fraction of lines in
$A$ and $p_2$-fraction in $B$. We show that (i) the model captures the
real-world phenomenon of unexpected large scale cascades and exhibits
interesting transition behavior: the final collapse is always first-order, but
it can be preceded by a sequence of first and second-order transitions; (ii)
network robustness tightly depends on the coupling coefficients $a$ and $b$,
and robustness is maximized at non-trivial $a,b$ values in general; (iii)
unlike existing models, interdependence has a multi-faceted impact on system
robustness in that interdependency can lead to an improved robustness for each
individual network.

magnetic moment of $\mu$ of $\sim$ 2$\mu_{B}$ and, remarkably, exhibits an
exceptionally large atomic scale

annual rainfalls in a short period of time and the narrow distance between the
headwater and the coast. The second one is the unbalanced development of
economic sectors in comparison with distribution of fresh water resources.
Finally, long-term drought is also common in this area. The construction of a
carry-over dam (Esteghlal Dam) and several conveyance pipelines and withdrawing
of the surface water and groundwater resources were considered as the solution
to deal with those challenges. During recent drought, severe overdraft and
inefficient use of recourses confirmed the fact that all done before are not
enough. During this period, there was a tendency to store water in reservoir in
order to meet the demand of the urban sector. Therefore, the agricultural
demand was the first victim of water allocation policy. It caused over
exploitation of the groundwater resources (to meet the agricultural demand) and
considerable losses (evaporation and leakage) from the reservoir. All of the
above-mentioned problems confirm the necessity of the development of a
conjunctive use policy. In this paper, all demand related to the Esteghlal Dam

applicable conjunctive policy which as well guarantees the conservation of the

treated equivalently. If it is true this must lead to the appearance of the
Unruh effect analogous to Hawking's black hole radiation. It says that a
detector moving with a constant acceleration $w$ sees a boson's thermal bath
with its temperature $T_w=\hbar w/2\pi k_B c$. Practical detection of the Unruh
effect requires extremely strong acceleration and fast probing sources. Here we
demonstrate that x-rays scattering from highly accelerated electrons can be
used for such detection. We present two, feasible for the Unruh effect, designs
for highly accelerated systems produced in underdense plasma irradiated by high
intensity lasers pulses. The first is Thomson scattering of a XFEL pulse from
plasma wave excited by an intense laser pulse. Properly chosen observation
angles enable us to distinguish the Unruh effect from the normal Doppler shift
with a reasonable photon number. The second is a system consisting of electron
bunches accelerated by a laser wake-field, as sources and as detectors, which
move in a constantly accelerating reference frame (Rindler space) and are

binary-single interactions lead to two successive gravitational wave (GW)
mergers; a scenario we refer to as a `double GW merger'. The first GW merger
happens during the three-body interaction through a two-body GW capture, where
the second GW merger is between the BH formed in the first GW merger and the
remaining bound single BH. We estimate the probability for observing both GW
mergers, and for observing only the second merger that we refer to as a `prompt
second-generation (2G) merger'. We find that the probability for observing both
GW mergers is only notable for co-planar interactions with low GW kicks
($\lesssim 10^{1}-10^{2}$ kms$^{-1}$), which suggests that double GW mergers
can be used to probe environments facilitating such interactions. For isotropic
encounters, such as the one found in globular clusters, the probability for
prompt 2G mergers to form is only at the percent level, suggesting that
second-generation mergers are most likely to be between BHs which have swapped
partners at least once.

link interference constraints are described by a link interference graph. For
such a network, we design routing-scheduling policies that maximize the
end-to-end timely throughput of the network. Timely throughput of a flow $f$ is
defined as the average rate at which packets of flow $f$ reach their
destination node $d_f$ within their deadline.
  Our policy has several surprising characteristics. Firstly, we show that the
optimal routing-scheduling decision for an individual packet that is present at
a wireless node $i\in V$ is solely a function of its location, and ""age"". Thus,
a wireless node $i$ does not require the knowledge of the ""global"" network
state in order to maximize the timely throughput. We notice that in comparison,
under the backpressure routing policy, a node $i$ requires only the knowledge
of its neighbours queue lengths in order to guarantee maximal stability, and
hence is decentralized. The key difference arises due to the fact that in our
set-up the packets loose their utility once their ""age"" has crossed their
deadline, thus making the task of optimizing timely throughput much more
challenging than that of ensuring network stability. Of course, due to this key
difference, the decision process involved in maximizing the timely throughput
is also much more complex than that involved in ensuring network-wide queue
stabilization. In view of this, our results are somewhat surprising.

applications as bulk materials. However, new physics and applications often
emerge by dimensional reduction from three dimension (3D) to two dimension
(2D). Here, we study, by molecular dynamics simulations, how the
liquid-to-glass transition of a binary Cu50Zr50 MG is affected by spatial
dimensionality. We find clear evidence that crystal-like structural ordering
controls both dynamic heterogeneity and slow dynamics, and thus plays a crucial
role in the formation of the 2DMG. Although the 2DMG reproduces the dynamical
behaviors of its 3D counterpart by considering Mermin-Wagner-type fluctuations
specific to 2D, this atomic-scale structural mechanism is essentially different
from that for the 3DMG in which icosahedral clusters incompatible with
crystallographic symmetry play a key role in glassy behaviors. Our finding
provides a new structural mechanism for the formation of 2DMGs, which cannot be
inferred from the knowledge of 3DMGs. The results suggest a structural basis
for the glass transition in 2DMG and provide possible explanations for some
previous experimental observations in ultrathin film MGs.

Until now, it was deemed necessary to use a time stepping algorithm with a

generally appears when solving stochastic differential equations can only
influence the length of the magnetization. This quantity is however fixed in
the case of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In this paper, we
exploit this fact to straightforwardly extend existing high order solvers with

to their ability to extract increasingly better features at each network layer.
However, the improved performance of additional layers in a deep network comes
at the cost of added latency and energy usage in feedforward inference. As
networks continue to get deeper and larger, these costs become more prohibitive
for real-time and energy-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we
present BranchyNet, a novel deep network architecture that is augmented with
additional side branch classifiers. The architecture allows prediction results
for a large portion of test samples to exit the network early via these
branches when samples can already be inferred with high confidence. BranchyNet
exploits the observation that features learned at an early layer of a network
may often be sufficient for the classification of many data points. For more
difficult samples, which are expected less frequently, BranchyNet will use
further or all network layers to provide the best likelihood of correct
prediction. We study the BranchyNet architecture using several well-known

computing services using devices at the network edge, called mobile edge
computing (MEC). The key operation of MEC, mobile computation offloading (MCO),
is to offload computation intensive tasks from users. Since each edge device
comprises an access point (AP) and a computer server (CS), a MEC network can be
decomposed as a radio access network (RAN) cascaded with a CS network (CSN).
Based on the architecture, we investigate network constrained latency
performance, namely communication latency (comm-latency) and computation
latency (comp-latency) under the constraints of RAN coverage and CSN stability.
To this end, a spatial random network is modeled featuring random node
distribution, parallel computing, non-orthogonal multiple access, and random
computation-task generation. Given the model and the said network constraints,
we derive the scaling laws of comm-latency and comp-latency with respect to
network-load parameters (density of mobiles and their task-generation rates)
and network-resource parameters (bandwidth, density of APs/CSs, CS computation
rate). Essentially, the analysis involves the interplay of theories of
stochastic geometry, queueing, and parallel computing. Combining the derived
scaling laws quantifies the tradeoffs between the latencies, network coverage
and network stability. The results provide useful guidelines for MEC-network
provisioning and planning by avoiding either of the cascaded RAN or CSN being a
performance bottleneck.

discriminator that tries to distinguish between enhanced spectrograms provided
by the generator and clean ones from the database using the noisy spectrogram
as a condition. We evaluate the performance of the cGAN method in terms of
perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI), and equal error rate (EER) of speaker verification (an

X-ray source is located at the nucleus of the galaxy at energies above 2 keV.
However, the point source resolves into diffuse emission at lower energies,
extending to the east, where the extranuclear [O III] emission, presumably
induced by a galactic-scale outflow, is present. The nuclear source is detected
by NuSTAR up to the rest-frame 30 keV. The strong, high-ionization Fe K line,
first seen by XMM-Newton, and subsequently by Suzaku and Chandra, is not
detected in the NuSTAR data. The line flux appears to have been declining
continuously between 2003 and 2016, while the continuum emission remained
stable to within 30%. The X-ray continuum below 10 keV is characterised by a
hard spectrum caused by cold absorption of nH ~1e23 cm-2, compatible to that of
the silicate absorption at 9.7 micron, and a broad absorption feature around 8
keV which we attribute to a high-ionization Fe K absorption edge. The latter is
best described by a blueshifted, high-ionization (log xi ~3) absorber. No extra
hard component, which would arise from a Compton-thick source, is seen in the
NuSTAR data. While a pure reflection scenario (with a totally hidden central
source) is viable, direct emission from the central source of L(2-10 keV) =
2e44 erg/s, behind layers of cold and hot absorbing gas may be an alternative
explanation. In this case, the relative X-ray quietness (Lx/L_AGN ~6e-3), the
high-ionization Fe line, strong outflows inferred from various observations,
and other similarities to the well-studied ULIRG/QSO Mrk 231 point that the

tools and methods has significantly benefited from the availability of reusable
test collections formed through a standardized and thoroughly tested
methodology, known as the Cranfield paradigm. Constructing these collections
requires obtaining relevance judgments for a pool of documents, retrieved by
systems participating in an evaluation task; thus involves immense human labor.
To alleviate this effort different methods for constructing collections have
been proposed in the literature, falling under two broad categories: (a)
sampling, and (b) active selection of documents. The former devises a smart
sampling strategy by choosing only a subset of documents to be assessed and
inferring evaluation measure on the basis of the obtained sample; the sampling
distribution is being fixed at the beginning of the process. The latter
recognizes that systems contributing documents to be judged vary in quality,
and actively selects documents from good systems. The quality of systems is
measured every time a new document is being judged. In this paper we seek to
solve the problem of large-scale retrieval evaluation combining the two
approaches. We devise an active sampling method that avoids the bias of the
active selection methods towards good systems, and at the same time reduces the
variance of the current sampling approaches by placing a distribution over
systems, which varies as judgments become available. We validate the proposed
method using TREC data and demonstrate the advantages of this new method
compared to past approaches.

addressed by imposing prior knowledge on the (unknown) image and on the

image priors based on statistical properties of generic natural images.
However, in many applications, it is known that the image being recovered

this knowledge allows obtaining more accurate priors. In this work, we propose
a method where a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to learn a class-adapted

the competitiveness of the proposed method in terms of restoration quality when
dealing with images containing text, faces, or fingerprints. Additionally,

80 million proteins in UniProt, the Universal Protein Resource, measured in

collections of computer functions measured in programming language tokens, at
all scales. That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural
properties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might
share the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.
  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components
built from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the
Conservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical
mechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous
and homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique
alphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp
unimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain
components each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and
yield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.
  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer
software, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the
elements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour
co-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts). In
each case, the predictions of the theory are tested and supported to high
levels of statistical significance. We also show that in the same heterogeneous
system, different but consistent alphabets must be related by a power-law. We
demonstrate this on a large body of music by excluding and including note
duration in the definition of the unique alphabet of notes.

increased breathing rate, and confusion. Sepsis is difficult to predict,
diagnose, and treat. Patients who develop sepsis have an increased risk of
complications and death and face higher health care costs and longer
hospitalization. Today, sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among
populations in intensive care units (ICUs). In this paper, we look at the
problem of early detection of sepsis by using temporal data mining. We focus on
the use of knowledge-based temporal abstraction to create meaningful
interval-based abstractions, and on time-interval mining to discover frequent
interval-based patterns. We used 2,560 cases derived from the MIMIC-III
database. We found that the distribution of the temporal patterns whose
frequency is above 10% discovered in the records of septic patients during the
last 6 and 12 hours before onset of sepsis is significantly different from that
distribution within a similar period, during an equivalent time window during
hospitalization, in the records of non-septic patients. This discovery is
encouraging for the purpose of performing an early diagnosis of sepsis using
the discovered patterns as constructed features.

  duration and high fluence","12 pages, 5 figures",,,"BIGCCS Centre deliverable nr. D14.1606","physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) is an experimental technique that has been
extensively used for in-flame measurement of soot properties. The traditional
laser used for LII has been Nd:YAG laser with 5-10 ns pulse durations. The
present study investigates an unexpected LII signal behaviour in the form of a
secondary peak observed when using long laser pulse duration in the range of
hundreds of ns. Temporal LII signals at varying fluences (up to 4.5 J/cm2) and
pulse durations are presented and discussed. Although an explanation based on
theoretical grounds has not been found, the study shows that the phenomenon is
independent of pulse duration and that its appearance correlates with laser
fluences of approximately 1.1 J/cm2. Artificial signal generated by the
experimental procedures cannot be excluded, but if so could not be identified.
One suggestion is an amplified effect of the phenomenon observed in the
literature where new particles were created from the molecular cloud during
high laser fluence LII. Since LII using long pulse durations are not widely
used, but present a true potential in relation to sensor technology, this
unexpected LII behaviour, either physically linked to the laser-soot
interaction or induced by experimental flaw, should be further watched and
understood.

magnetograms acquired by Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the
Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) were utilized. Two areas, a coronal hole area
(CH) and an area of super-granulation pattern, SG, were analyzed. We explored
the displacement and separation spectra and the behavior of the turbulent
diffusion coefficient, $K$. The displacement and separation spectra are very
similar to each other. Small magnetic elements (of size 3-100 squared pixels
and the detection threshold of 20 Mx sm$^{-2}$) in both CH and SG areas
disperse in the same way and they are more mobile than the large elements (of
size 20-400 squared pixels and the detection threshold of 130 Mx sm$^{-2}$).
The regime of super-diffusivity is found for small elements ($\gamma \approx
1.3 $ and $K$ growing from $\sim$100 to $\sim$ 300 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$). Large
elements in the CH area are scanty and show super-diffusion with $\gamma
\approx 1.2$ and $K$ = (62-96) km$^2$ s$^{-1}$ on rather narrow range of
500-2200 km. Large elements in the SG area demonstrate two ranges of linearity
and two diffusivity regimes: sub-diffusivity on scales (900-2500) km with
$\gamma=0.88$ and $K$ decreasing from $\sim$130 to $\sim$100 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$,
and super-diffusivity on scales (2500-4800) km with $\gamma \approx 1.3$ and
$K$ growing from $\sim$140 to $\sim$200 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Comparison of our
results with the previously published shows that there is a tendency of
saturation of the diffusion coefficient on large scales, i.e., the turbulent

provide valuable information of the acceleration processes inside the jets, the

microquasars have been deeply studied to shed light on these aspects: Cygnus
X-1 and Cygnus X-3. Both systems display the canonical hard and soft X-ray
spectral states of black hole transients, where the radiation is dominated by
non-thermal emission from the corona and jets and by thermal emission from the
disk, respectively. Here, we report on the detection of Cygnus X-1 above 60 MeV
using 7.5 yr of Pass8 Fermi-LAT data, correlated with the hard X-ray state. A
hint of orbital flux modulation was also found, as the source is only detected
in phases around the compact object superior conjunction. We conclude that the
high-energy gamma-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 is most likely associated with
jets and its detection allow us to constrain the production site. Moreover, we
include in the discussion the final results of a MAGIC long-term campaign on
Cygnus X-1 that reaches almost 100 hr of observations at different X-ray

comprehensive follow-up observations for a total of about 70 hr. We discuss our

method simultaneously detects and recognizes characters by sliding the text
line image with character models, which are learned end-to-end on text line
images labeled with text transcripts. The character classifier outputs on the
sliding windows are normalized and decoded with Connectionist Temporal
Classification (CTC) based algorithm. Compared to previous methods, our method
has a number of appealing properties: (1) It avoids the difficulty of character
segmentation which hinders the performance of segmentation-based recognition
methods; (2) The model can be trained simply and efficiently because it avoids
gradient vanishing/exploding in training RNN-LSTM based models; (3) It bases on
character models trained free of lexicon, and can recognize unknown words. (4)
The recognition process is highly parallel and enables fast recognition. Our
experiments on several challenging English and Chinese benchmarks, including
the IIIT-5K, SVT, ICDAR03/13 and TRW15 datasets, demonstrate that the proposed

the potential coronal model performs best. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge model
outperforms the others in predicting high speed enhancements and streamer

particle production from the effects of quantum statistics and final-state
interactions in two-particle correlations. Kaon femtoscopy is an important
supplement to that of pions because it allows one to distinguish between
different model scenarios working equally well for pions. In particular, we
compare the measured 3D kaon radii with a purely hydrodynamical calculation and
a model where the hydrodynamic phase is followed by a hadronic rescattering
stage. The former predicts an approximate transverse mass ($m_{\mathrm{T}}$)
scaling of source radii obtained from pion and kaon correlations. This
$m_{\mathrm{T}}$ scaling appears to be broken in our data, which indicates the
importance of the hadronic rescattering phase at LHC energies. A
$k_{\mathrm{T}}$ scaling of pion and kaon source radii is observed instead. The
time of maximal emission of the system is estimated using the three-dimensional
femtoscopic analysis for kaons. The measured emission time is larger than that
of pions. Our observation is well supported by the hydrokinetic model

  of Perchlorethylene in Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry According to
  Measured Chlorine Isotope Effects","26 pages, four figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dechlorinated fragmental ions of organochlorines can be commonly found on
electron ionization-mass spectrometry (EI-MS). Yet it is still unclear whether
multiple dechlorination reactions taking place in EI-MS are concerted or
stepwise. This study investigated the concertedness of the multiple
dechlorination reactions of perchlorethylene (PCE) in EI-MS in light of the
observed chlorine isotope effects during different dechlorination reactions
along with the detected MS signal intensities. The fluctuant isotope ratios
among different ions revealed that the observed multiple dechlorinated
reactions in the EI-DFS-HRMS were stepwise. And the changing trends of isotope
ratios of the ions detected by EI-qMS might suggest that the observed multiple
dechlorination reactions in this MS were concerted. Mechanisms for these
concerted/stepwise multiple dechlorination reactions are tentatively
interpreted. Besides the evidence of isotope effects, according to the
quasi-equilibrium theory, the MS signal intensities also suggested that the
multiple dechlorination reactions in the EI-HRMS were likely stepwise, while
those in the EI-qMS might be concerted. The distance from the ionization region
to the mass analyzer entrance in an MS may be a critical factor affecting the
dechlorination reactions of ions flying over this distance. This distance in
the EI-qMS is significantly shorter than that in the EI-HRMS. Thus, the main
detected ions in the EI-qMS might be generated during the ionization and
in-source fragmentation processes, while the main ions detected in the EI-HRMS
might be produced during the fragmentation of precursor ions flying over the
distance. We deduce that the main dechlorination reactions in the ionization
region were concerted, while those taking place during the flight of precursor
ions over the distance from the ionization region to the mass analyzer entrance
were stepwise.

terms of the complex spectral analysis. The absorption spectrum of an impurity
embedded in semi-infinite superlattice is investigated. The boundary condition
on the continuum causes a large energy dependence of the self-energy, enhances
the nonlinearity of the eigenvalue problem of the effective Hamiltonian,
yielding several nonanalytic resonance states. The overall spectral features is
perfectly reproduced by the direct transitions to these discrete resonance
states. Even with a single optical transition path the spectrum exhibits an
asymmetric Fano profile, which is enhanced for the transition to the
nonanalytic resonance states. Since this is the genuine eigenstates of the
total Hamiltonian, there is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the
absorption spectrum, avoiding the arbitrary interpretation based on the quantum
interference. The spectral change around the exceptional point is well
understood when we extract the resonant state component.

with different models for single asperity contact, including adhesive and
elasto-plastic contacts, to derive a relation between the applied load and the
friction force on a rough interface. We find that when the summit distribution
is Gumbel, and the contact model is Hertzian we have the closest conformity
with Amontons law. The range over which Gumbel distribution mimics Amontons law
is wider than the Greenwood-Williamson Model. However exact conformity with
Amonton's law does not seem for any of the well-known EVS distributions. On the
other hand plastic deformations in contact area reduce the relative change of
pressure slightly with Gumbel distribution. Elastic-plastic contact mixes with
Gumbel distribution for summits. it shows the best conformity with Amonton`s
law. Other extreme value statistics are also studied, and results presented. We
combine Gumbel distribution with GW-Mc Cool model which is an improved case of
GW model, it takes into account a bandwidth for wavelengths of {\alpha}.
Comparison of this model with original GW-Mc Cool model and other simplified
versions of BGT reveals that Gumbel distribution has a better conformity with
Amonton`s law for all values of {\alpha}. When adhesive contact model is used,
the main observation is that for zero or even negative applied load, there is
some friction. Asperities with height even less than the separation of two
surfaces are in contact. For a small value of adhesion parameter, a better
conformity with Amontons law is observed. Relative pressure increases for
stronger adhesion which means that adhesion controlled friction dominated by
load controlled friction. We also observe that adhesion increases on a surface
with a lower value of roughness.

a general constitutive law. Its lightcone structure can be more complicated
than that of Maxwell theory as is shown by the phenomenon of birefringence. We
study the energy density of quantized pre-metric electrodynamics theories with
linear constitutive laws admitting a single hyperbolicity double-cone and show
that averages of the energy density along the worldlines of suitable observers
obey a Quantum Energy Inequality (QEI) in states that satisfy a microlocal
spectrum condition. The worldlines must meet two conditions: (a) the classical
weak energy condition must hold along them, and (b) their velocity vectors have
positive contractions with all positive frequency null covectors (we call such
trajectories `subluminal').
  After stating our general results, we explicitly quantize the electromagnetic
potential in a translationally invariant uniaxial birefringent crystal. Since
the propagation of light in such a crystal is governed by two nested
lightcones, the theory shows features absent in ordinary (quantized) Maxwell
electrodynamics. We then compute a QEI bound for worldlines of inertial
`subluminal' observers, which generalizes known results from the Maxwell
theory. Finally, it is shown that the QEIs fail along trajectories that have
velocity vectors which are timelike with respect to only one of the lightcones.

number of layers and type of stacking. Using first-principles calculations
within the framework of density functional theory, we investigate the
electronic properties of bilayer black phosphorus with an interlayer twist
angle of 90$^\circ$. These calculations are complemented with a simple
$\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ model which is able to capture most of the low energy
features and is valid for arbitrary twist angles. The electronic spectrum of
90$^\circ$ twisted bilayer black phosphorus is found to be x-y isotropic in
contrast to the monolayer. However x-y anisotropy, and a partial return to
monolayer-like behavior, particularly in the valence band, can be induced by an
external out-of-plane electric field. Moreover, the preferred hole effective
mass can be rotated by 90$^\circ$ simply by changing the direction of the
applied electric field. In particular, a +0.4 (-0.4) V/{\AA} out-of-plane
electric field results in a $\sim$60\% increase in the hole effective mass
along the y (x) axis and enhances the $m^*_{y}/m^*_{x}$ ($m^*_{x}/m^*_{y}$)
ratio as much as by a factor of 40. Our DFT and $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$
simulations clearly indicate that the twist angle in combination with an
appropriate gate voltage is a novel way to tune the electronic and optical
properties of bilayer phosphorus and it gives us a new degree of freedom to
engineer the properties of black phosphorus based devices.

achieved state-of-art performance in the recent fewer years, but it is widely
concerned that the recurrent neural network (RNN) units are very hard to
capture the long-distance state information, which means RNN can hardly find
the feature with long term dependency as the sequence becomes longer.
Similarly, convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced into NMT for
speeding recently, however, CNN focus on capturing the local feature of the
sequence; To relieve this issue, we incorporate a relation network into the
standard encoder-decoder framework to enhance information-propogation in neural
network, ensuring that the information of the source sentence can flow into the
decoder adequately. Experiments show that proposed framework outperforms the
statistical MT model and the state-of-art NMT model significantly on two data

is a subset of the ranks of elements in $C_2$ for any chains $C_1,C_2\in

nesting, for short) of $P$, and $P$ is said to be nested. In 1970s, Griggs
conjectured that every normalized matching rank-unimodal poset is nested. This
conjecture is proved to be true only for all posets of rank 2 [W:05], some
posets of rank 3 [HLS:09,ENSST:11], and the very special cases for higher
ranks. For general cases, it is still widely open. In this paper, we provide
some sufficient conditions on the rank numbers of posets of rank 3 to satisfies

a well-known result of Lau--Paterson, resolve a recent conjecture of

approximation properties of the dual operator algebras can be averaged to
approximation properties $\mathbb{G}$. Similar homological techniques are used
to prove that $\ell^1(\mathbb{G})$ is not relatively operator biflat for any
non-Kac discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$; a discrete Kac algebra
$\mathbb{G}$ with Kirchberg's factorization property is weakly amenable if and
only if $L^1_{cb}(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is operator amenable, and amenability
of a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ implies
$C_u(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})=L^1(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})\widehat{\otimes}_{L^1(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})}C_0(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$

(CFD) approach is very challenging since several sub-models for interfacial
mass, momentum and energy transfer in such flows are still not well established
and require further development and validation. Once validating a particular
model, it is important that all key parameter involved in the model are
carefully verified. Such verification is typically performed by separate effect
tests, where one parameter at a time is compared to a measured or otherwise
known value. Needless to say that for complex models, which are typical for CFD
applications to two-phase flow, the number of independent parameters that need
to be verified can be quite high. This particular feature makes the validation
process of complex CFD models in open source codes very attractive, since full
access to the implementation details is possible.
  This paper is concerned with implementation and validation of two-phase
boiling bubbly flow models using the OpenFOAM, open source environment. The
model employs the two-fluid formulation of the conservation equations with the
Reynolds-averaged treatment of the turbulent terms. The model consists of six
conservation equations for the liquid and the vapor phase, allowing for the
thermodynamic non-equilibrium and compressibility of both phases. In addition,
the model includes two transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy
and energy dissipation and one transport equation for the interfacial area
concentration. New models for wall heat partitioning as well as for the phase
change terms in nucleate boiling have been implemented. Sensitivity studies as
well as validation of the model against measured data available in the open
literature have been performed and it has been shown that a reasonable
agreement between predictions and experiments has been achieved.

task due to paper degradation over time. Recognition-free retrieval or word
spotting is popularly used for information retrieval and digitization of the
historical handwritten documents. However, the performance of word spotting
algorithms depends heavily on feature detection and representation methods.
Although there exist popular feature descriptors such as Scale Invariant
Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), the invariant
properties of these descriptors amplify the noise in the degraded document
images, rendering them more sensitive to noise and complex characteristics of
historical manuscripts. Therefore, an efficient and relaxed feature descriptor
is required as handwritten words across different documents are indeed similar,
but not identical. This paper introduces a Radial Line Fourier (RLF) descriptor
for handwritten word representation, with a short feature vector of 32
dimensions. A segmentation-free and training-free handwritten word spotting
method is studied herein that relies on the proposed RLF descriptor, takes into
account different keypoint representations and uses a simple

accesses depend on sensitive information. Especially in public clouds, where
caches are shared across several tenants, cache attacks remain an unsolved
problem. Cache attacks rely on evictions by the spy process, which alter the
execution behavior of the victim process. We show that hardware performance
events of cryptographic routines reveal the presence of cache attacks. Based on
this observation, we propose CacheShield, a tool to protect legacy code by
monitoring its execution and detecting the presence of cache attacks, thus
providing the opportunity to take preventative measures. CacheShield can be run
by users and does not require alteration of the OS or hypervisor, while
previously proposed software-based countermeasures require cooperation from the
hypervisor. Unlike methods that try to detect malicious processes, our approach
is lean, as only a fraction of the system needs to be monitored. It also
integrates well into today's cloud infrastructure, as concerned users can opt
to use CacheShield without support from the cloud service provider. Our results
show that CacheShield detects cache attacks fast, with high reliability, and
with few false positives, even in the presence of strong noise.

bit model designed to capture some features of the emergent string in the
tensionless limit. The model consists of a pair of bosonic and fermionic bit
operators transforming in the adjoint representation of the color group SU(N).
Color confinement is not achieved as a dynamical effect, but instead is
enforced by an explicit singlet projection. At large N and finite temperature,
the model has a non trivial thermodynamics. In particular, there is a Hagedorn
type transition at a finite temperature $T=T_H$ where the string degrees of
freedom are liberated and the free energy gets a large contribution $\sim
N^{2}$ that plays the role of an order parameter. For $T>T_H$, the low
temperature phase becomes unstable. In the new phase, the thermodynamically
favoured configurations are characterized by a non-trivial gapped density of
the SU(N) angles associated with the singlet projection. We present an accurate
algorithm for the determination of the density profile at $N=\infty$. In
particular, we determine the gap endpoint at generic temperature and analytical
expansions valid near the Hagedorn transition as well as at high temperature.
The leading order corrections are characterized by non-trivial exponents that

fundamental to investigate how information or diseases propagate in a
population, it often suffers from incompleteness, which possibly leads to
biased conclusions. A major challenge is thus to estimate the outcome of
spreading processes occurring on temporal networks built from partial
information. To cope with this problem, we devise an approach based on
Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) -- a dimensionality reduction technique
from multi-linear algebra. The key idea is to learn a low-dimensional
representation of the temporal network built from partial information, to adapt
it to take into account temporal and structural heterogeneity properties known
to be crucial for spreading processes occurring on networks, and to construct
in this way a surrogate network similar to the complete original network. To
test our method, we consider several human-proximity networks, on which we
simulate a loss of data. Using our approach on the resulting partial networks,
we build a surrogate version of the complete network for each. We then compare
the outcome of a spreading process on the complete networks (non altered by a
loss of data) and on the surrogate networks. We observe that the epidemic sizes
obtained using the surrogate networks are in good agreement with those measured
on the complete networks. Finally, we propose an extension of our framework

with the contact order, a simple measure of the spatial organisation of the

the main chain loops formed by amino acids which are in contact. Here we argue
that folding kinetics can be influenced also by the entanglement that loops may
undergo within the overall three dimensional protein structure. In order to
explore such possibility, we introduce a novel descriptor, which we call
""maximum intrachain contact entanglement"". Specifically, we measure the maximum
Gaussian entanglement between any looped portion of a protein and any other
non-overlapping subchain of the same protein, which is easily computed by
discretized line integrals on the coordinates of the $C_{\alpha}$ atoms. By
analyzing experimental data sets of two-state and multistate folders, we show
that also the new index is a good predictor of the folding rate. Moreover,
being only partially correlated with previous methods, it can be integrated

scheme (DUGKS) to speed up the simulations of the steady flows in all flow
regimes. The DUGKS is a multi-scale scheme finite volume method (FVM) for all
flow regimes because of its ability in recovering the Navier-Stokes solution in
the continuum regime and the free transport mechanism in rarefied flow, which
couples particle transport and collision in the flux evaluation at cell
interfaces. In this paper the predicted iterations are constructed to update
the macroscopic variables and the gas distribution functions in discrete
microscopic velocity space. The lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS)
factorization is applied to solve the implicit equations. The fast convergence
of implicit discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (IDUGKS) can be achieved
through the adoption of a numerical time step with large CFL number. Some
numerical test cases, including the Couette flow, the lid-driven cavity flows
under different Knudsen number and the hypersonic flow in transition flow
regime around a circular cylinder, have been performed to validate this
proposed IDUGKS. The computational efficiency of the IDUGKS to simulate the
steady flows in all flow regimes can be improved by one or two orders of
magnitude in comparison with the explicit DUGKS.

parameters - spin diffusion length and spin Hall angle. In metals, these are
typically determined indirectly by probing magnetoresistance in magnet/metal
heterostructures, assuming knowledge of the interfacial properties. We suggest
profiling the charge current induced spin Hall spin accumulation in metals, via
detection of the magnetic stray field generated by the associated static
magnetization, as a direct means of determining spin transport parameters. We
evaluate the spatial profile of the stray field as well as the Oersted field
generated by the charge current. We thus demonstrate that such a charge current
induced spin accumulation is well within the detection limit of contemporary
technology. Measuring the stray fields may enable direct access to spin-related
properties of metals paving the way for a better and consistent understanding

  Complex Event Processing","To be published in ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware 2017",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed Complex Event Processing (DCEP) is a paradigm to infer the
occurrence of complex situations in the surrounding world from basic events
like sensor readings. In doing so, DCEP operators detect event patterns on
their incoming event streams. To yield high operator throughput, data
parallelization frameworks divide the incoming event streams of an operator
into overlapping windows that are processed in parallel by a number of operator
instances. In doing so, the basic assumption is that the different windows can
be processed independently from each other. However, consumption policies
enforce that events can only be part of one pattern instance; then, they are
consumed, i.e., removed from further pattern detection. That implies that the
constituent events of a pattern instance detected in one window are excluded
from all other windows as well, which breaks the data parallelism between
different windows. In this paper, we tackle this problem by means of
speculation: Based on the likelihood of an event's consumption in a window,
subsequent windows may speculatively suppress that event. We propose the
SPECTRE framework for speculative processing of multiple dependent windows in
parallel. Our evaluations show an up to linear scalability of SPECTRE with the
number of CPU cores.

proposed approach has numerous advantages: (i) it is non-invasive in a
time-critical process, (ii) it can be retrofitted in legacy systems, and (iii)
it is airgapped from the computerized components of the AM process, preventing
simultaneous compromise. Evaluation on a desktop 3D Printer detects all attacks

extend it to the realistic case of many sources in the field of view by
isolating visibilities of each source with a faceting technique. In this second
paper we present a detailed algorithm for source extraction in the visibility

running simulations of SKA1-MID observations in the band 950-1150 MHz and
comparing original and measured values of galaxies' ellipticities. Shear
measurements from a realistic population of 10^4 galaxies randomly located in a
field of view of 1 deg^2 (i.e. the source density expected for the current
radio weak lensing survey proposal with SKA1) are also performed. At SNR >= 10,
the multiplicative bias is only a factor 1.5 worse than what found when
analysing individual sources, and is still comparable to the bias values
reported for similar measurement methods at optical wavelengths. The additive
bias is unchanged from the case of individual sources, but is significantly
larger than typically found in optical surveys. This bias depends on the shape
of the uv coverage and we suggest that a uv-plane weighting scheme to produce a
more isotropic shape could reduce and control additive bias.

symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. It is demonstrated that learning of the
resulting symmetric VAE (sVAE) has close connections to previously developed
adversarial-learning methods. This relationship helps unify the previously
distinct techniques of VAE and adversarially learning, and provides insights
that allow us to ameliorate shortcomings with some previously developed
adversarial methods. In addition to an analysis that motivates and explains the
sVAE, an extensive set of experiments validate the utility of the approach.

energy from reservoirs with inadequate initial permeability. While contributing
to enhancing the reservoir's permeability, hydraulic stimulation processes may
lead to undesired seismic activity. Here, we present a three dimensional
numerical model aiming to increase understanding of this mechanism and its
consequences. The fractured reservoir is modeled as a network of explicitly
represented large scale fractures immersed in a permeable rock matrix. The
numerical formulation is constructed by coupling three physical processes:
fluid flow, fracture deformation, and rock matrix deformation. For flow
simulations, the discrete fracture matrix model is used, which allows the fluid
transport from high permeable conductive fractures to the rock matrix and vice
versa. The mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using a hyperbolic
model with reversible and irreversible deformations. Linear elasticity is
assumed for the mechanical deformation and stress alteration of the rock
matrix. Fractures are modeled as lower dimensional surfaces embodied in the
domain, subjected to specific governing equations for their deformation along
the tangential and normal directions. Both the fluid flow and momentum balance
equations are approximated by finite volume discretizations. The new numerical
model is demonstrated considering a three dimensional fractured formation with
a network of 20 explicitly represented fractures. The effects of fluid exchange
between fractures and rock matrix on the permeability evolution and the
generated seismicity are examined for test cases resembling realistic reservoir
conditions.

expected properties of a system against a formal model of its behaviour

and CTL*, that describe how the system evolves state-by-state, are commonly
used as specification languages. They proved themselves quite successful in a
variety of application domains. However, properties constraining the temporal
ordering of temporally extended events as well as properties involving temporal
aggregations, which are inherently interval-based, can not be properly dealt
with by them. Interval temporal logics (ITLs), that take intervals as their
primitive temporal entities, turn out to be well-suited for the specification
and verification of interval properties of computations (we interpret all the
tracks of a Kripke structure as computation intervals).
  We study the model checking problem for some fragments of Halpern and
Shoham's modal logic of time intervals (HS). HS features one modality for each
possible ordering relation between pairs of intervals (the so-called Allen's
relations). First, we describe an EXPSPACE model checking algorithm for the HS
fragment of Allen's relations meets, met-by, starts, started-by, and finishes,
which exploits the possibility of finding, for each track (of unbounded
length), an equivalent bounded-length track representative. While checking a
property, it only needs to consider tracks whose length does not exceed the
given bound. We prove the model checking problem for such a fragment to be
PSPACE-hard. Finally, we identify other well-behaved HS fragments which are
expressive enough to capture meaningful interval properties of systems, such as
mutual exclusion, state reachability, and non-starvation, and whose complexity
is less than or equal to that of LTL.

sonication to reshape the vesicular membranes and induce the lipid fusion

carried out to determine the optimum coating conditions and layer thickness. We
then explore the impact of surfactant SLBs on the cytotoxic potential and

indicate that SLBs mitigate the particle toxicity and internalization rates. In
the cytoplasm, the particle localization is also strongly coating dependent. It

resistivity (NDR) emanates from transfer of electrons between two different
energy bands in a semiconductor. If applying a voltage (electric field)
transfers electrons from an energy sub band of a low effective mass to a second
one with higher effective mass, then the current drops. This manifests itself
as a negative slope or NDR in the I-V characteristics of the device which is in
essence due to the reduction of electron mobility. Recalling that mobility is
inversely proportional to electron effective mass or curvature of the energy
sub band. This effect was observed in semiconductors like GaAs which has direct
bandgap of very low effective mass and its second indirect sub band is about
300 meV above the former. More importantly a self-repeating oscillation of
spatially accumulated charge carriers along the transport direction occurs
which is the artifact of NDR, a process which is called Gunn oscillation and
was observed by J. B. Gunn. In sharp contrast to GaAs, bulk silicon has a very
high energy spacing (~1 eV) which renders the initiation of transfer-induced
NDR unobservable. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), semi-empirical 10

quantum error correction codes that encode multiple qubits per logical block.
CPC codes have a canonical structure involving successive rounds of bit and
phase parity checks, supplemented by cross-checks to fix the code distance. In
this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to CPC codes using conventional
quantum circuit notation. We demonstrate the implementation of a CPC code on
real hardware, by designing a [[4,2,2]] detection code for the IBM 5Q
superconducting qubit device. Whilst the individual gate-error rates on the IBM
device are too high to realise a fault tolerant quantum detection code, our
results show that the syndrome information from a full encode-decode cycle of
the [[4,2,2]] CPC code can be used to increase the output state fidelity by
post-selection. Following this, we generalise CPC codes to other quantum
technologies by showing that their structure allows them to be efficiently
compiled using any experimentally realistic native two-qubit gate. We introduce
a three-stage CPC design process for the construction of hardware-optimised
quantum memories. As a proof-of-concept example, we apply our design process to
an idealised linear seven-qubit ion trap. In the first stage of the process, we
use exhaustive search methods to find a large set of [[7,3,3]] codes that
saturate the quantum Hamming bound for seven qubits. We then optimise over the
discovered set of codes to meet the hardware and layout demands of the ion trap
device. We also discuss how the CPC design process will generalise to

performance of massive MIMO wiretap channels. We consider a scenario in which a
multi-antenna transmitter selects a subset of transmit antennas with the
strongest channel gains. Confidential messages are then transmitted to a
multi-antenna legitimate receiver while the channel is being overheard by a
multi-antenna eavesdropper. For this setup, we approximate the distribution of
the instantaneous secrecy rate in the large-system limit. The approximation
enables us to investigate the optimal number of selected antennas which
maximizes the asymptotic secrecy throughput of the system. We show that
increasing the number of selected antennas enhances the secrecy performance of
the system up to some optimal value, and that further growth in the number of
selected antennas has a destructive effect. Using the large-system
approximation, we obtain the optimal number of selected antennas analytically
for various scenarios. Our numerical investigations show an accurate match
between simulations and the analytic results even for not so large dimensions.

clustering techniques where every feature is known for each point, our
algorithm can handle cases where a few feature values are unknown for every

clustering using a $\ell_0$ fusion penalty based optimization problem.
Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve a relaxation of this problem
using saturating non-convex fusion penalties. It is observed that this
algorithm produces solutions that degrade gradually with an increase in the
fraction of missing feature values. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed
method using a simulated dataset, the Wine dataset and also an under-sampled

While being able to accommodate inference of a deep neural network (DNN) in the

of the neural network at the edge and end devices. When supported by a scalable
distributed computing hierarchy, a DDNN can scale up in neural network size and
scale out in geographical span. Due to its distributed nature, DDNNs enhance
sensor fusion, system fault tolerance and data privacy for DNN applications. In
implementing a DDNN, we map sections of a DNN onto a distributed computing
hierarchy. By jointly training these sections, we minimize communication and
resource usage for devices and maximize usefulness of extracted features which
are utilized in the cloud. The resulting system has built-in support for
automatic sensor fusion and fault tolerance. As a proof of concept, we show a
DDNN can exploit geographical diversity of sensors to improve object
recognition accuracy and reduce communication cost. In our experiment, compared
with the traditional method of offloading raw sensor data to be processed in
the cloud, DDNN locally processes most sensor data on end devices while
achieving high accuracy and is able to reduce the communication cost by a

are carried out as a function of the angle between the global magnetic and

system is frustrated by the competition between vortex-vortex repulsion and
vortex-flux-tube attraction (pinning), leading to the formation of vortex

The generative network is trained by a minimax optimisation with a second

third conditioning neural network that pre-processes the input image, can
effectively extract patient-specific features for conditioning; and 2)
combining multiple generative models trained separately with heuristically
pre-disjointed training data sets can adequately mitigate the problem of mode
collapse. Trained with diagnostic T2-weighted MR images from 143 real patients
and 73,216 3D dense displacement fields from finite element simulations of
intraoperative prostate motion due to transrectal ultrasound probe pressure,
the proposed models produced physically-plausible patient-specific motion of
prostate glands. The ability to capture biomechanically simulated motion was
evaluated using two errors representing generalisability and specificity of the

the supernova from days +89 to +457 post-maximum brightness. The optical

prolonged interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) that accelerates the
transition from supernova to supernova remnant (SNR). Specifically, we find SN
2013by's H$\alpha$ profile exhibits significant broadening ($\sim$ 10,000 km

being excited by a reverse shock. A relatively flat X-ray light curve is

alone but requires an additional energy source most likely originating from the

represent and predict the governing dynamics since mechanical nonlinearities
are pronounced in certain applications such as energy harvesting. In this
paper, first, a consistent variational approach is used by considering
nonlinear elasticity theory to derive equations of motion for a single-layer
piezoelectric beam with and without the electromagnetic interactions (fully
dynamic and electrostatic). This modeling strategy is extended for the
three-layer piezoelectric smart composites by adopting the two widely-accepted
sandwich beam theories. For both single-layer and three-layer models, the
resulting infinite dimensional equations of motion can be formulated in the

required to store weights, as in a BNN, we show that it is essential to
minimize the memory used for temporaries which hold intermediate results
between layers in feedforward inference. To accomplish this, eBNN reorders the
computation of inference while preserving the original BNN structure, and uses
just a single floating-point temporary for the entire neural network. All
intermediate results from a layer are stored as binary values, as opposed to
floating-points used in current BNN implementations, leading to a 32x reduction

standard Cahn-Hilliard equation in case of a regular potential with unbounded
domain, like the classical double-well potential, for example. Necessary first
order conditions of optimality are derived under natural assumptions on the

Impulse noise is a common noise, which is caused by malfunctioning of sensor
elements or errors in the transmission of images. In medical images due to
presence of white foreground and black background, many pixels have intensities
similar to impulse noise and distinction between noisy and regular pixels is
difficult. In software techniques, the accuracy of the noise removal is more
important than the algorithm's complexity. But for hardware implementation
having a low complexity algorithm with an acceptable accuracy is essential. In
this paper a low complexity de-noising method is proposed that removes the
noise by local analysis of the image blocks. The proposed method distinguishes
non-noisy pixels that have noise-like intensities. All steps are designed to
have low hardware complexity. Simulation results show that for different
magnetic resonance images, the proposed method removes impulse noise with an
acceptable accuracy.

compact objects, and we provide the first constraints of the parameter space
using white dwarf stars. The branon dark matter model is characterized by two
free parameters, namely the branon mass particle M and the brane tension factor
$f$. The latter determines the strength of the interaction of branon dark
matter particles with baryons. By considering a typical white dwarf star we
were able to obtain constraints on branon dark matter and compare with current
limits obtained by direct detection searches and dark matter abundance. In
particular our results show that i) for heavy branons with a mass $M > 10 GeV$
white dwarfs fail to provide us with bounds better than current limits from DM
direct detection searches, and ii) for light branons in the mass range $2 keV <
M < 1 GeV$, which cannot be probed neither with current dark matter experiments
nor with the next generation of detectors, the dark matter abundance constrain
determines $f$ as a function of $M$ in the range $0.1 GeV < M < 1 GeV$ for the
branon mass and $1 GeV < f < 5 GeV$ for the brane tension factor. Furthermore,
our findings indicate that the limits from white dwarfs are not stronger than
the dark matter abundance constrain.

that is internationally recognised, usability tests were conducted to compare
different versions of the website. The dependant variables derived from the
questionnaire were analysed (via descriptive statistics) to elucidate the
multilingual UI design issues. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), five

We speculate that this is due to the magnetostriction which depends on both of

strengths as ferromagnetic J$_{1}$ = -0.12 meV and antiferromagnetic J$_{2}$ =
0.014 meV, respectively. The competition between different kinds of
superexchange interactions results in the ferromagnetic intralayer interaction.

propose a fuzzy system for adaptive control of the embedding strength factor.
Features such as saliency, intensity, and edge-concentration, are used as fuzzy

channel MSE as a figure of merit for communication system. We also show that

the two wells is modulated by another BEC trapped in a harmonic potential
symmetrically positioned at the center of the double-well potential. The
inter-species interactions couple the dynamics of the two BECs, which give rise
to interesting features in the tunneling oscillations. Adopting a two-mode
approximation for the BEC in the double-well potential and coupling it with the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation of the harmonically trapped BEC, we numerically
investigate the coupled dynamics of the BEC mixture, and map out the phase
diagram of the tunneling dynamics. We show that the dynamical back action of
the BEC in the harmonic trap leads to strong non-linearity in the oscillations
of the BEC in the double-well potential, which enriches the system dynamics,
and enhances macroscopic self trapping. The transition between the Josephson
oscillation and the self-trapping dynamics can be identified by monitoring the
oscillation frequency of the double-well BEC. Our results suggest the
possibility of tuning the tunneling dynamics of BECs in double-well potentials.

cells to minimize thermalization losses, but cannot efficiently capture diffuse
sunlight, which contributes to a high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and
limits their use to geographical regions with high direct sunlight insolation.
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) harness light generated by luminophores
embedded in a light-trapping waveguide to concentrate light onto smaller cells.
LSCs can absorb both direct and diffuse sunlight, and thus can operate as flat
plate receivers at a fixed tilt and with a conventional module form factor.
However, current LSCs experience significant power loss through parasitic
luminophore absorption and incomplete light trapping by the optical waveguide.
Here we introduce a tandem LSC device architecture that overcomes both of these
limitations, consisting of a PLMA polymer layer with embedded CdSe/CdS quantum
dot (QD) luminophores and InGaP micro-cells, which serve as a high bandgap
absorber on top of a conventional Si photovoltaic. We experimentally synthesize
CdSe/CdS QDs with exceptionally high quantum-yield (99%) and ultra-narrowband
emission optimally matched to fabricated III-V InGaP micro-cells. Using a Monte
Carlo ray-tracing model, we show the radiative limit power conversion
efficiency for a module with these components to be 30.8% diffuse sunlight
conditions. These results indicate that a tandem LSC-on-Si architecture could
significantly improve upon the efficiency of a conventional Si photovoltaic
module with simple and straightforward alterations of the module lamination
steps of a Si photovoltaic manufacturing process, with promise for widespread
module deployment across diverse geographical regions and energy markets.
