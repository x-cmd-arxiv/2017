Seebeck effects. The coupled elliptic and doubly quasilinear parabolic
equations for the electric and heat currents are stated, respectively,
accomplished with power-type boundary conditions that describe the thermal
radiative effects. To verify the existence of weak solutions to this coupled
problem (Theorem 1), analytical investigations for abstract multi-quasilinear
elliptic-parabolic systems with nonsmooth data are presented (Theorem 2 and 3).
They are essentially approximated solutions based on the Rothe method. It
consists on introducing time discretized problems, establishing their
existence, and then passing to the limit as the time step goes to zero. The
proof of the existence of time discretized solutions relies on fixed point and
compactness arguments. In this study, we establish quantitative estimates to
clarify the smallness conditions.

By considering the energy conservation rule governing this type of interactions
in a statistical average sense, the impact of different forms of the
regularized energy-conserving Dirac delta function on 3-phonon scattering rates
was evaluated. Strikingly, adopting Lorentz distribution, in accordance with
the shape of eigenenergy broadening of phonon normal modes due to the leading
term of crystal anharmonicity, was found to play a critical role in activating
umklapp processes at low temperature, leading to intrinsic lattice thermal
conductivity peak at finite temperature for perfect crystal. This
characteristic behavior, unique to the Lorentzian, lays foundation for
developing adjustable-parameter-free computational models for reliable
prediction of the finite lattice conductivity at low temperature, even in the
absence of extrinsic scattering processes. An iterative solution scheme for
Boltzmann Transport Equation was used to compute the intrinsic thermal
conductivity of solid argon over the entire temperature range (2-80 K). For the
first time, the experimentally observed $T^2$ behavior in the low temperature,
$T$, limit and the peak temperature (~ 8 K) were successfully recovered, in
addition to the classical high temperature $T^{-1}$ behavior above 20 K by the
sole use of 3-phonon processes. The good agreement with experiment indicates
that phonon-phonon interactions dominate over the entire temperature range in
argon, contrary to previous hypotheses that phonon-defect scattering dominates
the sub-peak regime. Anisotropy in thermal conductivity of single crystal at
low temperature due to phonon focusing was observed. In addition, argon
conductivity is underestimated by an order of magnitude in Single Mode

finite-time models of thermal machines---at optimal performance---such as
efficiency at maximum power, coefficient of performance at maximum cooling
power, and other such criteria. In this letter, a {\it global} principle
consistent with linear irreversible thermodynamics is proposed for the whole
cycle---without considering details of irreversibilities in the individual
steps of the cycle. This helps to express the total duration of the cycle as
$\tau \propto {\bar{Q}^2}/{\Delta_{\rm tot} S}$, where $\bar{Q}$ models the
effective heat transferred through the machine during the cycle, and
$\Delta_{\rm tot} S$ is the total entropy generated. By taking $\bar{Q}$ in the
form of simple algebraic means (such as arithmetic and geometric means) over
the heats exchanged by the reservoirs, the present approach is able to predict
various standard expressions for figures of merit at optimal performance, as
well as the bounds respected by them. It simplifies the optimization procedure
to a one-parameter optimization, and provides a fresh perspective on the issue
of universality at optimal performance, for small difference in reservoir
temperatures. As an illustration, we compare performance of a partially
optimized four-step endoreversible cycle with the present approach.

high sensitivity and video rate performance ($\sim$ 60 Hz). However, room
temperature operation is still beyond reach for semiconductor photodetectors in
the 8-12 $\mu$m wavelength band$^2$, and all developments for applications such

For these devices, high sensitivity and high speed have never been compatible
with high temperature operation$^{6, 7}$. Here, we show that a 9 $\mu$m quantum
well infrared photodetector$^8$, implemented in a metamaterial made of

increased with respect to the electrical area for each resonator, thus
significantly reducing the dark current of the device$^{13}$. Furthermore, we
show that our photonic architecture overcomes intrinsic limitations of the

increased responsivity allows us, for the first time, to take advantage of the

angular momentum through their winds. When a magnetic field is present at the
surface of a star, efficient angular momentum losses can still be achieved even
when the mass-loss rate is very modest, at lower metallicities, or for
lower-initial-mass stars. In a close binary system, the effect of wind magnetic
braking also interacts with the influence of tides, resulting in a complex
evolution of rotation. We study the interactions between the process of wind
magnetic braking and tides in close binary systems. We discuss the evolution of
a 10 M$_\odot$ star in a close binary system with a 7 M$_\odot$ companion using
the Geneva stellar evolution code. The initial orbital period is 1.2 days. The
10 M$_\odot$ star has a surface magnetic field of 1 kG. Various initial
rotations are considered. We use two different approaches for the internal
angular momentum transport. In one of them, angular momentum is transported by
shear and meridional currents. In the other, a strong internal magnetic field
imposes nearly perfect solid-body rotation. The evolution of the primary is
computed until the first mass-transfer episode occurs. The cases of different
values for the magnetic fields and for various orbital periods and mass ratios
are briefly discussed. We show that, independently of the initial rotation rate
of the primary and the efficiency of the internal angular momentum transport,
the surface rotation of the primary will converge, in a time that is short with
respect to the main-sequence lifetime, towards a slowly evolving velocity that
is different from the synchronization velocity. (abridged).

potential) of mass $m>0$ in arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes and in the
presence of external sources. We motivate a notion of continuity in the mass
for families of observables $\left\{O_m\right\}_{m>0}$ and we investigate the
massless limit $m\to0$. Our limiting procedure is local and covariant and it
does not require a choice of reference state. We find that the limit exists
only on a subset of observables, which automatically implements a gauge
equivalence on the massless vector potential. For topologically non-trivial
spacetimes, one may consider several inequivalent choices of gauge equivalence
and our procedure selects the one which is expected from considerations
involving the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Gauss' law. We note that the limiting
theory does not automatically reproduce Maxwell's equation, but it can be
imposed consistently when the external current is conserved. To recover the
correct Maxwell dynamics from the limiting procedure would require an
additional control on limits of states. We illustrate this only in the
classical case, where the dynamics is recovered when the Lorenz constraint
remains well behaved in the limit.

$\mathrm{MX_2}$ materials revealed the formation of nanoscale patterns with
networks and globules of domain walls. This is thought to be responsible for
the metallization transition of the Mott insulator and for stabilization of a
""hidden"" state. In response, here we present studies of the classical charged
lattice gas model emulating the superlattice of polarons ubiquitous to the
material of choice $1T-\mathrm{TaS_2}$. The injection pulse was simulated by
introducing a small random concentration of voids which subsequent evolution
was followed by means of Monte Carlo cooling. Below the detected phase
transition, the voids gradually coalesce into domain walls forming locally
connected globules and then the global network leading to a mosaic
fragmentation into domains with different degenerate ground states. The
obtained patterns closely resemble the experimental STM visualizations. The
surprising aggregation of charged voids is understood by fractionalization of
their charges across the walls' lines.

unstable condensate background is the fundamental physical model, that can be
applied to study the development of modulation instability (MI) and formation
of rogue waves. The complete integrability of the NLSE via inverse scattering
transform enables the decomposition of the initial conditions into elementary
nonlinear modes: breathers and continuous spectrum waves. The small localized
condensate perturbations (SLCP) that grow as a result of MI have been of
fundamental interest in nonlinear physics for many years. Here, we demonstrate
that Kuznetsov-Ma and superregular NLSE breathers play the key role in the
dynamics of a wide class of SLCP. During the nonlinear stage of MI development,
collisions of these breathers lead to the formation of rogue waves. We present
new scenarios of rogue wave formation for randomly distributed breathers as
well as for artificially prepared initial conditions. For the latter case, we
present an analytical description based on the exact expressions found for the
space-phase shifts that breathers acquire after collisions with each other.
Finally, the presence of Kuznetsov-Ma and superregular breathers in
arbitrary-type condensate perturbations is demonstrated by solving the
Zakharov-Shabat eigenvalue problem with high numerical accuracy.

module over a hypersurface defined by $f+y^2$, then the first syzygy of $N/yN$
decomposes as the direct sum of $N$ and its own first syzygy. This was extended
by Herzog-Popescu to hypersurfaces $f+y^n$, replacing $N/yN$ by $N/y^{n-1}N$.
We show, in the same setting as Herzog-Popescu, that the first syzygy of
$N/y^{k}N$ is always an extension of $N$ by its first syzygy, and moreover that
this extension has useful approximation properties. We give two applications.
First, we construct a ring $\Lambda^\#$ over which every finitely generated
module has an eventually $2$-periodic projective resolution, prompting us to
call it a ""non-commutative hypersurface ring"". Second, we give upper bounds on
the dimension of the stable module category (a.k.a. the singularity category)
of a hypersurface defined by a polynomial of the form $x_1^{a_1} + \dots +

network based on the observed information diffusion events, or cascades, where
the observations for a given cascade consist of only the timestamps of
infection for infected nodes but not the source of the infection. Most of the
existing work on this problem has focused on estimating a diffusion matrix
without any structural assumptions on it. In this paper, we propose a novel
model based on the intuition that an information is more likely to propagate
among two nodes if they are interested in similar topics which are also
prominent in the information content. In particular, our model endows each node
with an influence vector (which measures how authoritative the node is on each
topic) and a receptivity vector (which measures how susceptible the node is for
each topic). We show how this node-topic structure can be estimated from the
observed cascades, and prove the consistency of the estimator. Experiments on
synthetic and real data demonstrate the improved performance and better
interpretability of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

distinct outflows have been detected with dynamical ages of ~11,700 and 17,200

years as a result of anisotropic accretion events is responsible. The
collimated outflows exhibit velocities of ~2 km s$^{-1}$, similar in velocity
to that of other FUor objects presented in this series but significantly slower
than previous observations and model predictions. The V1647 Ori system is
seemingly connected by an ""arm"" of material to a large unresolved structure
located ~20$""$ to the west. The complex environment surrounding V1647 Ori
suggests it is in the early stages of star formation which may relate to its

the scatter in the red sequence compared to previous catalogs of the same
clusters). This method is based on robustly determining the distribution of
background pixel values and should provide comparable improvement in
photometric analysis of any crowded fields. We produce new multiwavelength
catalogs for the 25 CLASH cluster fields in all 16 bandpasses from the UV

spectroscopic values from the literature finds a ~30% decrease in the redshift
deviation from previously-released CLASH photometry. This improvement in
redshift precision, in combination with a detection scheme designed to maximize
purity, yields a substantial upgrade in cluster member identification over the
previous CLASH galaxy catalog. We construct luminosity functions for each
cluster, reliably reaching depths of at least 4.5 mag below M* in every case,
and deeper still in several clusters. We measure M* , $\alpha$, and their
redshift evolution, assuming the cluster populations are coeval, and find
little to no evolution of $\alpha$, $-0.9\lesssim\langle\alpha\rangle\lesssim
-0.8$, and M* values consistent with passive evolution. We present a catalog of

photometry for the full fields of view of all 25 CLASH clusters. Not only will
our new photometric catalogs enable new studies of the properties of CLASH

nuclei (AGN) in order to stave off overcooling in massive galaxies and galaxy
groups and clusters. An important independent test is whether or not the
simulations capture the broad demographics of the observed AGN population.
Here, we have used the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations to produce realistic synthetic catalogs of X-ray AGN out to $z$=3,
with the aim of comparing the catalogs to the observed X-ray AGN population in
the XXL survey and other recent surveys. We focused on the unabsorbed X-ray
luminosity function (XLF), the Eddington ratio distribution, the black hole
mass function, and the projected clustering of X-ray AGN. To compute the
unabsorbed XLF of the simulated AGN, we used recent empirically-determined
bolometric corrections. We show that the simulated AGN sample accurately
reproduces the observed XLF over 3 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity in
all redshift bins. To compare to the observed Eddington ratio distribution and
the clustering of AGN, we produced detailed 'XMM-Newton-detected' catalogs of
the simulated AGN. This requires the production of synthetic X-ray images
extracted from light cones of the simulations that fold in the relevant
instrumental effects of XMM-Newton. We apply a luminosity- and
redshift-dependent obscuration function for the AGN and employ the same AGN
detection algorithm as used for the real XXL survey. We demonstrate that the
detected population of simulated AGN reproduces the observed Eddington ratio
distribution and projected clustering from XXL quite well. We conclude that the
simulations have a broadly realistic population of AGN and that our synthetic
X-ray AGN catalogs should be useful for interpreting additional trends and as a
helpful tool for quantifying AGN contamination in galaxy group and cluster
X-ray surveys.

considerably more complicated. Here we show that, in the case of vortex $rings$
and for bulk modes that are much longer than the typical ring size, one can
perform a systematic multipole expansion of the effective action and recast it
into the simpler scalar field language. In a sense, in the presence of vortex
rings the non-single valuedness of the scalar can be hidden inside the rings,
and thus out of the reach of the multipole expansion. As an application of our
techniques, we compute by standard effective field theory methods the sound
emitted by an oscillating vortex ring.

tracers of the Galactic gravitational potential at moderate Galactocentric
distances, and can also be used as probes of the law of gravity on Galactic
scales. Here, we compare for the first time the generation of such streams in
Newtonian and Milgromian gravity (MOND). We first compute analytical results to
investigate the expected shape of the GC gravitational potential in both
frameworks, and we then run N-body simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code.
We find that the GCs tend to become lopsided in MOND. This is a consequence of
the external field effect which breaks the strong equivalence principle. When
the GC is filling its tidal radius the lopsidedness generates a strongly
asymmetric tidal stream. In Newtonian dynamics, such markedly asymmetric
streams can in general only be the consequence of interactions with dark matter
subhalos, giant molecular clouds, or interaction with the Galactic bar. In
these Newtonian cases, the asymmetry is the consequence of a very large gap in
the stream, whilst in MOND it is a true asymmetry. This should thus allow us in
the future to distinguish these different scenarios by making deep observations
of the environment of the asymmetric stellar stream of Palomar 5. Moreover, our
simulations indicate that the high internal velocity dispersion of Palomar 5

introduced the generalization of this theory to the experimentally relevant

are described by localized Wannier orbitals respecting the symmetries of the

describe topological insulators. We then show how to generate a band
representation from a particular Wyckoff position and determine which Wyckoff
positions generate elementary band representations for all space groups. This
theory applies to spinful and spinless systems, in all dimensions, with and

that it results in a finer classification of topological phases than approaches
based only on the symmetry of wavefunctions at special points in the Brillouin

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stx2332",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations from the Evolution
and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project to investigate
the formation of hot hydrostatic haloes and their dependence on feedback
mechanisms. We find that the appearance of a strong bimodality in the
probability density function (PDF) of the ratio of the radiative cooling and
dynamical times for halo gas provides a clear signature of the formation of a
hot corona. Haloes of total mass $10^{11.5}-10^{12}{\rm{M}}_{\odot}$ develop a
hot corona independent of redshift, at least in the interval $z=0-4$ where the
simulation has sufficiently good statistics. We analyse the build up of the hot
gas mass in the halo, $M_{\rm{hot}}$, as a function of halo mass and redshift
and find that while more energetic galactic winds powered by SNe increases
$M_{\rm{hot}}$, AGN feedback reduces it by ejecting gas from the halo. We also
study the thermal properties of gas accreting onto haloes and measure the
fraction of shock-heated gas as a function of redshift and halo mass. We
develop analytic and semianalytic approaches to estimate a `critical halo
mass', $M_{\rm{crit}}$, for hot halo formation. We find that the mass for which
the heating rate produced by accretion shocks equals the radiative cooling
rate, reproduces the mass above which haloes develop a significant hot
atmosphere. This yields a mass estimate of $M_{\rm{crit}} \approx
10^{11.7}{\rm{M}}_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, which agrees with the simulation results.
The value of $M_{\rm{crit}}$ depends more strongly on the cooling rate than on
any of the feedback parameters.

velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) maps are created and compared to observations of
disc galaxies obtained with the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field
spectrograph (SAMI), where $\sigma$-values greater than $150$ km s$^{-1}$ are
most naturally explained by bipolar outflows powered by starburst activity. We
find that the extension of the simulated edge-on (pixelated) velocity
dispersion probability distribution depends on stellar mass and star formation
rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with
low-M$_{\star}/$low-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ galaxies showing a narrow peak at low
$\sigma$ ($\sim30$ km s$^{-1}$) and more active,
high-M$_{\star}/$high-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ galaxies reaching $\sigma>150$ km

not entrain enough gas with T $<10^5$ K compared to observed galaxies, we find
that gas temperature is a good proxy for the presence of outflows. There is a
direct correlation between the thermal state of the gas and its state of motion
as described by the $\sigma$-distribution. The following equivalence relations
hold in EAGLE: $i)$ low-$\sigma$ peak $\,\Leftrightarrow\,$ disc of the galaxy

background (UGRB) by cross-correlating several galaxy catalogs with sky-maps of
the UGRB built from 78 months of Pass 8 Fermi-Large Area Telescope data. This
study updates and improves similar previous analyses in several aspects.
Firstly, the use of a larger gamma-ray dataset allows us to investigate the
energy dependence of the cross-correlation in more detail, using up to 8 energy
bins over a wide energy range of [0.25-500] GeV. Secondly, we consider larger
and deeper catalogs (2MASS Photometric-Redshift catalog, 2MPZ; WISE x
SuperCOSMOS, WISC; and SDSS-DR12 photometric-redshift dataset) in addition to
the ones employed in the previous studies (NVSS and SDSS-QSOs). Thirdly, we
exploit the redshift information available for the above catalogs to divide
them into redshift bins and perform the cross-correlation separately in each of
them.
  Our results confirm, with higher statistical significance, the detection of
cross-correlation signal between the UGRB maps and all the catalogs considered,
on angular scales smaller than 1 degree. Significances range from 16.3 sigma
for NVSS, 7 sigma for SDSS-DR12 and WISC, 5 sigma for 2MPZ and 4 sigma for
SDSS-QSOs. Furthermore, including redshift tomography, the significance of the
SDSS-DR12 signal strikingly rises up to 12 sigma and the one of WISC to 10.6
sigma. We offer a simple interpretation of the signal in the framework of the
halo model. The precise redshift and energy information allows us to clearly
detect a change over redshift in the spectral and clustering behavior of the

topological phase to a phase of physical fermions, and condensing pairs of
physical and emergent fermions. There are two distinct types of objects in
fermionic theories, which we call ""m-type"" and ""q-type"" particles. The
endomorphism algebras of q-type particles are complex Clifford algebras, and
they have no analogues in bosonic theories. We construct a fermionic
generalization of the tube category, which allows us to compute the
quasiparticle excitations in fermionic topological phases. We then prove a
series of results relating data in condensed theories to data in their parent

a fermion, then the tube category of the condensed theory satisfies
$\textbf{Tube}(\mathcal{C}/\psi) \cong \mathcal{C} \times (\mathcal{C}/\psi)$.

to three detailed examples of performing fermion condensation to produce
fermionic topological phases: we condense fermions in the Ising theory, the

We estimate that black holes (BHs) should receive natal kicks at birth of the
order of $\sigma\simeq 200$ (50) km/s if tidal processes do (not) realign
stellar spins. Our estimate is driven by two simple factors. The natal kick
dispersion $\sigma$ is bounded from above because large kicks disrupt too many
binaries (reducing the merger rate below the observed value). Conversely, the
natal kick distribution is bounded from below because modest kicks are needed
to produce a range of spin-orbit misalignments. A distribution of misalignments
increases our models' compatibility with LIGO's observations, if all BHs are
likely to have natal spins. Unlike related work which adopts a concrete BH
natal spin prescription, we explore a range of possible BH natal spin
distributions. Within the context of our models, for all of the choices of
$\sigma$ used here and within the context of one simple fiducial parameterized
spin distribution, observations favor low BH natal spin.

was surrounded by an accretion disk and originated inside the magnetosphere or

result, each control decision necessarily decreases the objective when the

$d$-dimensional conformal manifolds, from both mathematical and physical
perspectives. The results have a bearing on several conceptual issues relating
to asymptotic symmetries, in general relativity and in gauge-gravity duality,
as follows:
  (1: Ambient Construction) I draw from the remarkable work by Fefferman and
Graham (1985, 2012) on conformal geometry, in order to prove two propositions
and a theorem that characterise the classes of diffeomorphisms that qualify as
gravity-invisible. I define natural notions of gravity-invisibility (strong,
weak, and simpliciter) which apply to the diffeomorphisms of Poincar\'e metrics
in any dimension.
  (2: Dualities) I apply the notions of invisibility to gauge-gravity
dualities: which, roughly, relate Poincar\'e metrics in $d+1$ dimensions to
QFTs in $d$ dimensions. I contrast QFT-visible vs. QFT-invisible
diffeomorphisms: those gravity diffeomorphisms that can, respectively cannot,
be seen from the QFT.
  The QFT-invisible diffeomorphisms are the ones which are relevant to the hole
argument in Einstein spaces. The results on dualities are surprising, because
the class of QFT-visible diffeomorphisms is larger than expected, and the class
of QFT-invisible ones is smaller than expected, or usually believed, i.e.
larger than the PBH diffeomorphisms in Imbimbo et al. (2000). I also give a
general derivation of the asymptotic conformal Killing equation, which has not
appeared in the literature before.

of DIM representations are in correspondence with $(p,q)$-web diagrams of type
IIB string theory, under the identification of the algebraic intertwiner of
Awata, Feigin and Shiraishi with the refined topological vertex. Extending the
correspondence to the vertical reflection states, it is possible to engineer
the $\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver gauge theory of D-type (with unitary gauge groups).
In this way, the Nekrasov instanton partition function is reproduced from the
evaluation of expectation values of intertwiners. This computation leads to the
identification of the vertical reflection state with the orientifold plane of
string theory. We also provide a translation of this construction in the
Iqbal-Kozcaz-Vafa refined topological vertex formalism.

In a recent breakthrough, Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [CW18] improved the
state-of-the-art for light spanners by constructing a
$(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges and
$O_\epsilon(n^{1/k})$ lightness. Soon after, Filtser and Solomon [FS19] showed
that the classic greedy spanner construction achieves the same bounds The major
drawback of the greedy spanner is its running time of $O(mn^{1+1/k})$ (which is
faster than [CW16]). This makes the construction impractical even for graphs of
moderate size. Much faster spanner constructions do exist but they only achieve
lightness $\Omega_\epsilon(kn^{1/k})$, even when randomization is used. The
contribution of this paper is deterministic spanner constructions that are
fast, and achieve similar bounds as the state-of-the-art slower constructions.
Our first result is an $O_\epsilon(n^{2+1/k+\epsilon'})$ time spanner
construction which achieves the state-of-the-art bounds. Our second result is
an $O_\epsilon(m + n\log n)$ time construction of a spanner with
$(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$ stretch, $O(\log k\cdot n^{1+1/k})$ edges and
$O_\epsilon(\log k\cdot n^{1/k})$ lightness. This is an exponential improvement
in the dependence on $k$ compared to the previous result with such running
time. Finally, for the important special case where $k=\log n$, for every
constant $\epsilon>0$, we provide an $O(m+n^{1+\epsilon})$ time construction
that produces an $O(\log n)$-spanner with $O(n)$ edges and $O(1)$ lightness
which is asymptotically optimal. This is the first known sub-quadratic
construction of such a spanner for any $k = \omega(1)$. To achieve our
constructions, we show a novel deterministic incremental approximate distance
oracle, which may be of independent interest.

incorporate difficult electronic structure problems into large systems. This

can be applied to the renormalized Hamiltonian. For efficiency, the basis for
each fragment can be truncated, removing high-energy local arrangements of
electrons from consideration, and effectively defining collective coordinates
for the fragments. For a large number of problems (especially for
non-covalently interacting fragments), this has the potential to fold the
majority of electron correlation into the effective Hamiltonian, and it should
provide a robust approach to incorporating difficult electronic structure
problems into large systems. The number of terms in the exactly transformed
Hamiltonian formally scales quartically with system size, but this can be
reduced to quadratic in the mesoscopic regime, to within an arbitrary error
tolerance. Finally, all but a linear-scaling number of these terms may be
efficiently decomposed in terms of electrostatic interactions between a

particle aspect ratios $\alpha$. We find the critical packing fraction
$\phi_J(\alpha)$ for the jamming transition, and the average number of contacts
per particle $z_J(\alpha)$ at jamming. We find that both are nonmonotonic, with
a peak at $\alpha\approx 1$. We find that configurations at the compression
driven jamming point are always hypostatic for all $\alpha$, with
$z_J<z_\mathrm{iso}=2d_f=6$ the isostatic value. We show that, for moderately
elongated spherocylinders, there is no orientational ordering upon athermal
compression through jamming. We analyze in detail the eigenmodes of the
dynamical matrix close to the jamming point for a few different values of the
aspect ratio, from nearly circular to moderately elongated. We find that there
are low frequency bands containing $N(z_\mathrm{iso}-z_J)/2$ modes, such that
the frequency of these modes vanish as $\phi\to\phi_J$. We consider the
extended vs localized nature of these low frequency modes, and the extent to
which they involve translational or rotational motion, and find many low
frequency sliding modes where particles can move with little rotation. We
highlight the importance of treating side-to-side contacts, along flat sides of
the spherocylinder, properly for the correct determination of $z_J$. We note
the singular nature of taking the $\alpha\to 0$ limit. We discuss the
similarities and differences with previous work on jammed ellipses and
ellipsoids, to illustrate the effects that different particle shape have on
configurations at jamming.

to be normal modes. The former is probably related to the nearby 18:17 (m=18)

we also observe multiple localized features that appear to move at the local
keplerian rate and that persist for only a few months. One hypothesis is that
different groups of ring particles at the inner edge of the gap may be reacting
differently to the resonance with Prometheus, with local variations in the
forced eccentricity and/or pericenter; an alternative hypothesis is the
existence of several unseen objects embedded at or near the inner edge of the
Keeler gap, similar to those suspected to exist at the outer edges of the A and
B rings (Spitale and Porco 2009, 2010). In either case, observations of the

excellent energy resolution and extremely low backgrounds, at the level of
$\sim$0.1 count /(FWHM$\cdot$t$\cdot$yr) in the region of the signal. The

maximum-weight matching equals the value of a maximum-weight fractional
matching. Stable graphs play an important role in some interesting game theory
problems, such as network bargaining games and cooperative matching games,
because they characterize instances which admit stable outcomes. Motivated by
this, in the last few years many researchers have investigated the algorithmic
problem of turning a given graph into a stable one, via edge- and
vertex-removal operations. However, all the algorithmic results developed in
the literature so far only hold for unweighted instances, i.e., assuming unit
weights on the edges of $G$.
  We give the first polynomial-time algorithm to find a minimum cardinality
subset of vertices whose removal from $G$ yields a stable graph, for any
weighted graph $G$. The algorithm is combinatorial and exploits new structural
properties of basic fractional matchings, which are of independent interest. In
particular, one of the main ingredients of our result is the development of a
polynomial-time algorithm to compute a basic maximum-weight fractional matching
with minimum number of odd cycles in its support. This generalizes a
fundamental and classical result on unweighted matchings given by Balas more
than 30 years ago, which we expect to prove useful beyond this particular
application.
  In contrast, we show that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality subset
of edges whose removal from a weighted graph $G$ yields a stable graph, does
not admit any constant-factor approximation algorithm, unless $P=NP$. In this
setting, we develop an $O(\Delta)$-approximation algorithm for the problem,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a node in $G$.

The proposed lifting technique is an indirect method that does not require to

  Considering different finite-dimensional subspaces to approximate and

determine whether the gap opening is due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking
or not. Furthermore, the realization of the QAHE has been limited to low
temperatures. Here we have succeeded in generating a massive Dirac cone in a
MnBi2Se4 /Bi2Se3 heterostructure which was fabricated by self-assembling a
MnBi2Se4 layer on top of the Bi2Se3 surface as a result of the co-deposition of

shows ferromagnetism up to room temperature and a clear Dirac-cone gap opening
of ~100 meV without any other significant changes in the rest of the band
structure. It can be considered as a result of the direct interaction of the
surface Dirac cone and the magnetic layer rather than a magnetic proximity
effect. This spontaneously formed self-assembled heterostructure with a massive
Dirac spectrum, characterized by a nontrivial Chern number C = -1, has a
potential to realize the QAHE at significantly higher temperatures than

precipitates are performed to understand the effect of elastic and interfacial
energy on coarsened and rafted microstructures; the elastic energy is dependent
on the elastic stiffnesses, misfit strain, precipitate size, applied stress,
and precipitate spatial distribution. We observe characteristic microstructures
dependent on the type of applied stress that have the same {\gamma}' morphology

arising from coherent {\gamma}/{\gamma}' interfaces are important for
morphological evolution during creep. The results also indicate that the narrow

frequency trading using two key elements. First we introduce a new notion of
informed trader which we starkly contrast to current informed trader models. We
describe the exact nature of the `superior information' high frequency traders
have access to, and how these agents differ from the more standard `insider
traders' described in past papers. This then leads to a model and an empirical
analysis of the data which strongly supports our claims. The second key element
is a rigorous description of clearing conditions on a limit order book and how
to derive correct formulas for such a market. From a theoretical point of view,
this allows the exact identification of two frictions in the market, one of
which is intimately linked to our notion of `superior information'.
Empirically, we show that ignoring these frictions can misrepresent the wealth
exchanged on the market by 50%. Finally, we showcase two applications of our
approach: we measure the profits made by high frequency traders on NASDAQ and
re-visit the standard Black - Scholes model to determine how trading frictions
alter the delta-hedging strategy.

a multi-task FCN (MFCN) that utilizes two output branches for multi-task

CASIA v1.0, Columbia Uncompressed, Carvalho, and the DARPA/NIST Nimble

we report the disentanglement of critical thicknesses for electron

LaMnO3/SrTiO3 (001) heterostructures. Using a combination of element-specific
X-ray absorption spectroscopy and dichroism, and first-principles calculations,
interfacial electron accumulation and ferromagnetism have been observed within
the polar, antiferromagnetic insulator LaMnO3. Our results show that the
critical thickness for the onset of electron accumulation is as thin as 2 unit
cells (UC), significantly thinner than the observed critical thickness for
ferromagnetism of 5 UC. The absence of ferromagnetism below 5 UC is likely
induced by electron over-accumulation. In turn, by controlling the doping of
the LaMnO3, we are able to neutralize the excessive electrons from the polar
mismatch in ultrathin LaMnO3 films and thus enable ferromagnetism in films as
thin as 3 UC, extending the limits of our ability to synthesize and tailor
emergent phenomena at interfaces and demonstrating manipulation of the
electronic and magnetic structures of materials at the shortest length scales.

computational constraints frequently dictate the use of small supercells, often
as small as 96 atoms in oxides and compound semiconductors. In ionic compounds,
electrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised, but
self-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to
follow an asymptotic behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic
theory. Here we show that elastic effects are also important in the description
of defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively incorrect
conclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious
self-interaction does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic
theory. Considering the exemplar cases of metal oxides with fluorite structure,
we show that numerous previous studies, employing 96-atom supercells,
misidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects. We
show that the error is eliminated by employing larger cells (324, 768 and 1500
atoms), and careful analysis determines that elastic effects, not
electrostatic, are responsible. The spurious self-interaction was also observed
in non-oxide ionic compounds and irrespective of the computational method used,
thereby resolving long standing discrepancies between DFT and force-field
methods, previously attributed to the level of theory. The surprising magnitude
of the elastic effects are a cautionary tale for defect calculations in ionic
materials, particularly when employing computationally expensive methods or
when modelling large defect clusters. We propose two computationally
practicable methods to test the magnitude of the elastic self-interaction in
any ionic system.

system for liberating useful information from physical collections by bringing
specimens into the digital domain so they can be more readily shared, analyzed,
annotated and compared. It focuses on insects and is strongly motivated by the
desire to accelerate and augment current practices in insect taxonomy which
predominantly use text, 2D diagrams and images to describe and characterize
species. While these traditional kinds of descriptions are informative and
useful, they cannot cover insect specimens ""from all angles"" and precious
specimens are still exchanged between researchers and collections for this
reason. Furthermore, insects can be complex in structure and pose many
challenges to computer vision systems. We present a new prototype for a
practical, cost-effective system of off-the-shelf components to acquire
natural-colour 3D models of insects from around 3mm to 30mm in length. Colour
images are captured from different angles and focal depths using a digital
single lens reflex (DSLR) camera rig and two-axis turntable. These 2D images
are processed into 3D reconstructions using software based on a visual hull
algorithm. The resulting models are compact (around 10 megabytes), afford
excellent optical resolution, and can be readily embedded into documents and
web pages, as well as viewed on mobile devices. The system is portable, safe,
relatively affordable, and complements the sort of volumetric data that can be
acquired by computed tomography. This system provides a new way to augment the
description and documentation of insect species holotypes, reducing the need to
handle or ship specimens. It opens up new opportunities to collect data for
research, education, art, entertainment, biodiversity assessment and

depression of the freezing point by salinity. Elevated greenhouse gas
concentrations do not necessarily produce more open ocean area because of
possible dynamic regime transitions. For an evolutionary path leading to a

in episodic mass accretion -- prolonged periods of very low accretion
punctuated by short bursts of rapid accretion. However, the timescale and
amplitude for variability at the protostellar phase is almost entirely
unconstrained. In ""A JCMT/SCUBA-2 Transient Survey of Protostars in Nearby Star

eight fields within nearby (<500 pc) star forming regions to measure the
accretion variability of protostars. The total survey area of ~1.6 sq.deg.
includes ~105 peaks with peaks brighter than 0.5 Jy/beam (43 associated with

embedded protostars or disks). Each field has enough bright peaks for flux
calibration relative to other peaks in the same field, which improves upon the
nominal flux calibration uncertainties of sub-mm observations to reach a
precision of ~2-3% rms, and also provides quantified confidence in any measured
variability. The timescales and amplitudes of any sub-mm variation will then be
converted into variations in accretion rate and subsequently used to infer the
physical causes of the variability. This survey is the first dedicated survey

adopted to measure the sky brightness in a region extending from 4.5 to 7.0
apparent solar radii based on the experience of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar
Tele- scope (DKIST) site survey. Every month, the data were collected manually
for at least one week. We collected statistics of the sky brightness at four
bandpasses located at 450, 530, 890, and 940 nm. The results indicate that
aerosol scattering is of great importance for the diurnal variation of the sky
brightness. For most of the year, the sky brightness remains under 20
millionths per airmass before local Noon. On average, the sky brightness is
less than 20 millionths accounts for 40.41 % of the total observing time in a
clear day. The best observation time is from 9:00 to 13:00 (Beijing time).
Lijiang Observatory is therefore suitable for coronagraphs investigating the
structures and dynamics of the corona.

to its various applications. The state of the art is the attention-based
encoder-decoder framework that learns the mapping between input images and
output sequences in a purely data-driven way. However, we observe that existing
attention-based methods perform poorly on complicated and/or low-quality
images. One major reason is that existing methods cannot get accurate
alignments between feature areas and targets for such images. We call this
phenomenon ""attention drift"". To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose
the FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention Network) method that employs a
focusing attention mechanism to automatically draw back the drifted attention.
FAN consists of two major components: an attention network (AN) that is
responsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing methods, and a
focusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention by evaluating
whether AN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images.
Furthermore, different from the existing methods, we adopt a ResNet-based
network to enrich deep representations of scene text images. Extensive
experiments on various benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR
datasets, show that the FAN method substantially outperforms the existing
methods.

time-varying delays in both sensing and actuation using event-triggered

feedback to compensate for arbitrarily large known time-varying delays. We
establish, using a Lyapunov approach, the global asymptotic stability of the
closed-loop system as long as the open-loop system is globally input-to-state
stabilizable in the absence of time delays and sampling. We further prove that
the proposed event-triggered law has inter-event times that are uniformly lower
bounded and hence does not exhibit Zeno behavior. For the particular case of a
stabilizable linear system, we show global exponential stability of the
closed-loop system and analyze the trade-off between the rate of exponential
convergence and a bound on the sampling frequency. We illustrate these results
in simulation and also examine the properties of the proposed event-triggered
strategy beyond the class of systems for which stabilization can be guaranteed.

rate of merging BBHs which dynamically formed in dense star clusters by
combining the results of $N$-body simulations, modeling of globular clusters,
and cosmic star-cluster formation history. We estimate that the merger rate
density in the local universe within the redshift of 0.1 is 13--57 Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$. We find that the detection rate is 0.23--4.6 per year for the
current sensitivity limit and that it would increase to 5.1--99 per year for
the designed sensitivity which will be achieved in 2019. The distribution of
merger rate density in the local universe as a function of redshifted chirp
mass has a peak close to the low-mass end.The chirp mass function of the
detected mergers, on the other hand, has a peak at the high-mass end, but is
almost flat. This difference is simply because the detection range is larger
for more massive BBHs.

through hundreds or thousands of ideas. This paper provides an algorithm to
rank design ideas such that the ranked list simultaneously maximizes the
quality and diversity of recommended designs. To do so, we first define and
compare two diversity measures using Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) and
additive sub-modular functions. We show that DPPs are more suitable for items
expressed as text and that a greedy algorithm diversifies rankings with both
theoretical guarantees and empirical performance on what is otherwise an
NP-Hard problem. To produce such rankings, this paper contributes a novel way
to extend quality and diversity metrics from sets to permutations of ranked
lists.
  These rank metrics open up the use of multi-objective optimization to
describe trade-offs between diversity and quality in ranked lists. We use such
trade-off fronts to help designers select rankings using indifference curves.
However, we also show that rankings on trade-off front share a number of
top-ranked items; this means reviewing items (for a given depth like the top
10) from across the entire diversity-to-quality front incurs only a marginal
increase in the number of designs considered. While the proposed techniques are
general purpose enough to be used across domains, we demonstrate concrete
performance on selecting items in an online design community (OpenIDEO), where
our approach reduces the time required to review diverse, high-quality ideas
from around 25 hours to 90 minutes. This makes evaluation of crowd-generated
ideas tractable for a single designer. Our code is publicly accessible for

the mid-infrared spectral interval, and there are two reasons for this. This
spectral interval is very important for thermal bio-imaging and,
simultaneously, this spectral range includes vibrational lines of many chiral
biomolecules. Here we demonstrate that graphene plasmons indeed offer such
opportunity. In particular, we show that chiral graphene assemblies consisting
of a few graphene nanodisks can generate strong circular dichroism (CD) in the
mid-infrared interval. The CD signal is generated due to the plasmon-plasmon
coupling between adjacent nanodisks in the specially designed chiral graphene
assemblies. Because of the large dimension mismatch between the thickness of a
graphene layer and the incoming light's wavelength, three-dimensional
configurations with a total height of a few hundred nanometers are necessary to
obtain a strong CD signal in the mid-infrared range. The mid-infrared CD
strength is mainly governed by the total dimensions (total height and helix
scaffold radius) of the graphene nanodisk assembly, and by the plasmon-plasmon
interaction strength between its constitutive nanodisks. Both positive and
negative CD bands can be observed in the graphene assembly array. The frequency
interval of the plasmonic CD spectra overlaps with the vibrational modes of
some important biomolecules, such as DNA and many different peptides, giving
rise to the possibility of enhancing the vibrational optical activity of these
molecular species by attaching them to the graphene assemblies. Simultaneously
the spectral range of chiral mid-infrared plasmons in our structures appears
near the typical wavelength of the human-body thermal radiation and, therefore,
our chiral metastructures can be potentially utilized as optical components in
thermal imaging devices.

the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives
(e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely
executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other
vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the
merging vehicle optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem,
we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an
optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive
environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state
containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network
(DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal
state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this
DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the
long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the
optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be
extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving
through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow
conditions.

network. We can further compute a tentative CT synthesis from the midway of the
flow of feature maps, and then embed this tentative CT synthesis back to the
feature maps. This embedding operation results in better feature maps, which
are further transformed forward in DECNN. After repeat-ing this embedding
procedure for several times in the network, we can eventually synthesize a
final CT image in the end of the DECNN. We have validated our proposed method
on both brain and prostate datasets, by also compar-ing with the
state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results suggest that our DECNN (with
repeated embedding op-erations) demonstrates its superior performances, in
terms of both the perceptive quality of the synthesized CT image and the
run-time cost for synthesizing a CT image.

They often show rapid increase of polarization degree in the late phase. This
time evolution is generally believed to originate from the emergence of an
inner aspherical core, while an effect of polarized-scattered echoes by
circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN may also substantially contribute to this
polarization feature. In this study, we examine the effects of the scatted
echoes on the SN polarization through radiative transfer simulations for
various geometry and amount of CS dust. It has been found that
asymmetrically-distributed CS dust, which is generally inferred for red
supergiants, could reproduce the observed polarization features. We have
applied our results to SNe 2004dj and 2006ov, deriving the geometry and amount
of CS dust to explain their observed polarization features in this scenario.
For both SNe, the blob-like or bipolar distribution of CS dust rather than the
disk-like distribution is favored. The derived dust mass $M_{\mathrm{dust}}$ in
the blob model (the bipolar CS dust model) for SNe 2004dj and 2006ov are $\sim
7.5 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ ($\sim 8.5 \times10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$) and
$\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ ($\sim 1.3 \times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$),
respectively. Even in the case where this process would not play a dominant
role in the observed polarization signals, this effect should in principle
contribute to it, the strength of which depends on the nature of CS dust.
Therefore, this effect must be taken into account in discussing
multi-dimensional structure of an SN explosion through polarimetric
observations.

More precisely, we investigated the following question: ""For a function
compactly supported within a region similar to $R$, does there exist an
$R$-limited function that agrees with the function over its support for a
desired accuracy?"". Starting with the Fourier domain definition of an
$R$-limited function, we write the equivalent convolution and a discrete
Fourier transform representations for $R$-limited functions through
approximation of the convolution kernel using a discrete subset of Fourier
basis. The accuracy of the approximation of the convolution kernel determines
the accuracy of the discrete Fourier representation. Construction of the
discretization can be achieved using the tools from approximation theory as
demonstrated in the appendices. The main contribution of this work is proving
the equivalence between the discretization of the Fourier and convolution
representations of $R$-limited functions. Here discrete convolution
representation is restricted to shifts over a compactly supported region
similar to $R$. We show that discrete shifts for the convolution representation
are equivalent to the spectral parameters used in discretization of the Fourier
representation of the convolution kernel. This result is a generalization of
the cardinal theorem of interpolation of band-limited functions. The error
corresponding to discrete convolution representation is also bounded by the
approximation of the convolution kernel using discretized Fourier basis.

Shoham's interval temporal logic HS. In the last years, interval temporal logic
MC has received an increasing attention as a viable alternative to the
traditional (point-based) temporal logic MC, which can be recovered as a
special case. Most results have been obtained under the homogeneity assumption,
that constrains a proposition letter to hold over an interval if and only if it
holds over each component state. Recently, Lomuscio and Michaliszyn proposed a
way to relax such an assumption by exploiting regular expressions to define the
behaviour of proposition letters over intervals in terms of their component
states. When homogeneity is assumed, the exact complexity of MC is a difficult
open question for full HS and for its two syntactically maximal fragments
AA'BB'E' and AA'EB'E'. In this paper, we provide an asymptotically optimal
bound to the complexity of these two fragments under the more expressive
semantic variant based on regular expressions by showing that their MC problem
is AEXP_pol-complete, where AEXP_pol denotes the complexity class of problems
decided by exponential-time bounded alternating Turing Machines making a
polynomially bounded number of alternations.

the ones the agents can effectively play by only looking at what they observe

such uniform strategies. Nevertheless, its model-checking problem is difficult
(it requires a polynomial number of calls to an NP oracle), and practical

  This paper proposes a technique for model checking uniform memoryless

from the target states through a backward traversal, making sure that only
uniform strategies are explored. Nevertheless, building the strategies from the
ground up limits its applicability to constrained reachability objectives only.
This paper describes the approach in details and compares it experimentally
with existing approaches implemented into a BDD-based framework. These

field theory. We argue that the BCS-type s- or d-wave superconductivity

metals and heavily overdoped cuprates with large Fermi energies) is not
characteristic of underdoped to overdoped cuprates with low Fermi energies. The
superconducting order parameter in high-$T_c$ cuprates and other pseudogap
matters cannot be determined as the BCS-like (s- or d-wave) gap. We show that
the unconventional superconductivity/superfluidity occurring in the bosonic
limit of Cooper pairs exists in low Fermi energy systems where the bosonic
Cooper pairs are formed at a pseudogap temperature T* above the
uperconducting/superfluid transition temperature $T_c$ and then such bosons
condenses into a Bose superfluid at $T_c$. The pair condensation of attracting
bosons occurs at $T_c$ and then their single particle condensation sets in at
$T_c^*$ lower than $T_c$ (in three dimensions (3D)) or at T=0 (in two
dimensions (2D)). The coherent single particle and pair condensates of bosons
exist as two distinct superfluid phases below $T_c$. By solving the mean field
equations for high-$T_c$ cuprates, the novel superconducting states (i.e., a
vortex-like state existing below the temperature $T_v=T^{2D}_c$ lower than T*
but higher than $T_c=T^{3D}_c$ and two superconducting phases below $T_c$) and
their properties characterized by the boson superfluid stiffness are determined
and compared with the key experimental findings. The novel Bose-liquid

model needs to be modified in order to account for more complex behavior which
has been observed experimentally in some important biopolymers. For example,
the large flexibility of short ds-DNA has been attributed to kink or hinge
defects. In this paper, we calculate analytically, within the weak bending
approximation, the force-extension relation of a wormlike chain with a
permanent hinge defect along its contour. The defect is characterized by its
bending energy (which can be zero, in the completely flexible case) and its
position along the polymer contour. Besides the bending rigidity of the chain,
these are the only parameters which describe our model. We show that a hinge
defect causes a significant increase in the differential tensile compliance of
a pre-stressed chain. In the small force limit, a hinge defect significantly
increases the entropic elasticity. Our results apply to any pair of
semiflexible segments connected by a hinge. As such, they may also be relevant
to cytoskeletal filaments (F-actin, microtubules), where one may treat the
cross-link connecting two filaments as a hinge defect.

  Formation in Space and Time"", Memorie della SAIt",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The bathtub model of the star forming interstellar medium is based on the
powerful constraint that mass has to be conserved when gas flows through its
various thermal and density phases, ending up eventually in a young star or
being blown away by stellar feedback. It predicts that the star formation rate
of a molecular cloud is not determined by the cloud's mass or its internal
collapse timescale, but rather by the accretion rate of new gas. For the most
simple case of a constant accretion flow an equilibrium state is reached
quickly where the star formation rate equals the accretion rate and where the
dense gas mass is constant and independent of time. The mass of the young star
cluster, on the other hand, increases linearly with time. The stellar mass
fraction therefore represents a sensitive clock to measure the age of the
star-forming region. The bathtub model predicts that the efficiency of star
formation is small, of order 1%, even in the dense filamentary phases of
molecular clouds. It provides a simple explanation for the dense gas fraction
of order 10% in molecular clouds and for the large gas depletion timescales of
star-forming galaxies of order $5 \times 10^8 - 10^9$ yrs.

restricted to either equally or oppositely charged surfaces. Here, we provide a

the inter-surface separation, salt concentration, and arbitrary boundary

within the next decade and will reveal epochs of cosmic evolution that have
been previously inaccessible. Due to the lack of observations, many of the
astrophysical processes that took place at early times are poorly constrained.
In recent work we explored the astrophysical parameter space and the resulting
large variety of possible global (sky-averaged) 21-cm signals. Here we extend
our analysis to the fluctuations in the 21-cm signal, accounting for those
introduced by density and velocity, Ly$\alpha$ radiation, X-ray heating, and
ionization. While the radiation sources are usually highlighted, we find that
in many cases the density fluctuations play a significant role at intermediate
redshifts. Using both the power spectrum and its slope, we show that properties
of high-redshift sources can be extracted from the observable features of the
fluctuation pattern. For instance, the peak amplitude of ionization
fluctuations can be used to estimate whether heating occurred early or late
and, in the early case, to also deduce the cosmic mean ionized fraction at that
time. The slope of the power spectrum has a more universal redshift evolution
than the power spectrum itself and can thus be used more easily as a tracer of
high-redshift astrophysics. Its peaks can be used, for example, to estimate the
redshift of the Ly$\alpha$ coupling transition and the redshift of the heating
transition (and the mean gas temperature at that time). We also show that a
tight correlation is predicted between features of the power spectrum and of
the global signal, potentially yielding important consistency checks.

evolutionary tracks for the covered parameter space, showing in particular
that: a) Increased He abundance ON ITS OWN -- without having a
significant-enough MLR on the RGB -- DOES NOT lead to the production of EHB
stars; however, b) The bluest (hottest) HB positions do result from the
COMBINED effect of He-enhancement and increased MLR; c) The general trend is
that the effective temperature on the HB increases with decreasing metallicity,
but there is an indication for a halt, or even a reversal of this trend, as Z
further decreases below $10^{-3}$; d) EHB stars can serve as major contributors
to the UV flux emanating from their host system. Thus, the present

show that packet bundling can minimize resource starvation, especially for

ability to handle noisy and incomplete data. However, this correspondence set
is usually contaminated by outliers in practical scenarios, which has led to
many past contributions based on robust detectors such as the Hough transform

oriented points on the two models is constrained to cast votes in a 1 DoF
rotational subgroup of the full group of poses, SE(3). Kernel density
estimation allows combining the set of votes efficiently to determine a full 6

the broad immune components responsible for such cross-protection can be
determined. Such data can also be used to infer the timing and strength of some
immune components in controlling a primary infection, even in the absence of
serological data. By contrast, single infection data cannot be used to reliably
recover this information. Hence, sequential infection data enhances our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control and resolution of
infection, and generates new insight into how previous exposure influences the

to evaluate theoretical models of planet formation by direct observations of
protoplanets at early evolutionary stages, when they are still embedded in
their host disk. Up to now, only a few embedded candidate protoplanets have
been detected with semi-major axes of 20-50 au. Due to the small angular
separation from their central star, only long-baseline interferometry provides
the angular resolving power to detect disk asymmetries associated to
protoplanets at solar system scales in nearby star-forming regions. In
particular, infrared observations are crucial to observe scattered stellar
radiation and thermal re-emission in the vicinity of embedded companions
directly. For this purpose we performed radiative transfer simulations to
calculate the thermal re-emission and scattered stellar flux from a
protoplanetary disk hosting an embedded companion. Based on that, visibilities
and closure phases are calculated to simulate observations with the future beam
combiner MATISSE, operating at the L, M and N bands at the VLTI. We find that
the flux ratio of the embedded source to the central star can be as low as 0.5
to 0.6 % for a detection at a feasible significance level due to the heated
dust in the vicinity of the embedded source. Furthermore, we find that the
likelihood for detection is highest for sources at intermediate distances

matching and non-matching pairs. In a dataset of 39K training pairs, we obtain
0.91 Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for a CNN that outputs a binary
classification matching decision, and 0.89 AUC for another CNN that outputs a
matching score. In comparison, classical keypoint matching methods like SIFT,

Architectures based on 2D topological codes are effective for near-term
implementations of fault tolerance. To obtain high performance with these
architectures, we require a decoder which can adapt to the wide variety of
error models present in experiments. The typical approach to the problem of
decoding the surface code is to reduce it to minimum-weight perfect matching in
a way that provides a suboptimal threshold error rate, and is specialized to
correct a specific error model. Recently, optimal threshold error rates for a
variety of error models have been obtained by methods which do not use
minimum-weight perfect matching, showing that such thresholds can be achieved
in polynomial time. It is an open question whether these results can also be
achieved by minimum-weight perfect matching. In this work, we use belief
propagation and a novel algorithm for producing edge weights to increase the
utility of minimum-weight perfect matching for decoding surface codes. This
allows us to correct depolarizing errors using the rotated surface code,
obtaining a threshold of $17.76 \pm 0.02 \%$. This is larger than the threshold
achieved by previous matching-based decoders ($14.88 \pm 0.02 \%$), though
still below the known upper bound of $\sim 18.9 \%$.

constant and density decreases exponentially with radius. We compute the
cross-covariance function using a finite element method in spherical geometry
and in the frequency domain. The ratio between first- and second-skip
amplitudes in the time-distance diagram is used as a diagnostic to compare
boundary conditions and to compare with observations. We find that a boundary

approximation of small angles of incidence accurately reproduces the `infinite
atmosphere' solution for high-frequency waves. When the radiative boundary

investigated in the context of coding theoretic problems, such as network
coding, and in the context of hat games, such as the guessing game and
Winkler's hat game. The instability of an FDS is the minimum Hamming distance
between a state and its image under the FDS, while the stability is the minimum
of the reciprocal of the Hamming distance; they are both directly related to
Winkler's hat game. In this paper, we study the value of the (in)stability of
FDSs with prescribed interaction graphs. The first main contribution of this
paper is the study of the maximum stability for interaction graphs with a loop
on each vertex. We determine the maximum (in)stability for large enough
alphabets and also prove some lower bounds for the Boolean alphabet. We also
compare the maximum stability for arbitrary functions compared to monotone
functions only. The second main contribution of the paper is the study of the
average (in)stability of FDSs with a given interaction graph. We show that the
average stability tends to zero with high alphabets, and we then investigate
the average instability. In that study, we give bounds on the number of FDSs
with positive instability (i.e fixed point free functions). We then conjecture
that all non-acyclic graphs will have an average instability which does not
tend to zero when the alphabet is large. We prove this conjecture for some
classes of graphs, including cycles.

for chemistry in circumstellar envelopes around late-type stars. The size of
the envelope is important when modelling low-J transition lines and deriving
mass-loss rates from such lines. Now that ALMA is coming to full power the
extent of the CO emitting region can be measured directly for nearby asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars. In parallel, it has become obvious in the past few
years that the strength of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) can have a
significant impact on the interpretation of the emission lines.
  In this paper an update and extension of the classical Mamon et al. (1988;
ApJ 328, 797) paper is presented; these authors provided the CO abundance
profile, described by two parameters, as a function of mass-loss rate and
expansion velocity. Following recent work an improved numerical method and
updated H$_2$ and CO shielding functions are used and a larger grid is
calculated that covers more parameter space, including the strength of the
ISRF.
  The effect of changing the photodissociation radius on the low-J CO line
intensities is illustrated in two cases.

anisotropic factors indicate that both compounds have high elastic anisotropy.
The shear anisotropic factors show higher elastic anisotropy than the
percentage anisotropy in these compounds. The Debye temperature and bulk
modulus increases with pressure but decreases with temperature as usual for
metals. The magnetic susceptibility of TaOsSi follow the Curie law but NaOsSi
do not follow due to its delocalized magnetic moment and electronic specific
heat slightly deviates from the linear relationship with temperature. The
calculated band structures of XOsSi compounds show metallic nature. In both

  Enhancement","10 pages, 4 figures, Journal",,,,"cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enhancing noisy speech is an important task to restore its quality and to
improve its intelligibility. In traditional non-machine-learning (ML) based
approaches the parameters required for noise reduction are estimated blindly
from the noisy observation while the actual filter functions are derived
analytically based on statistical assumptions. Even though such approaches
generalize well to many different acoustic conditions, the noise suppression
capability in transient noises is low. To amend this shortcoming,
machine-learning (ML) methods such as deep learning have been employed for
speech enhancement. However, due to their data-driven nature, the
generalization of ML based approaches to unknown noise types is still
discussed. To improve the generalization of ML based algorithms and to enhance
the noise suppression of non-ML based methods, we propose a combination of both
approaches. For this, we employ the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the a posteriori SNR estimated as input features in a deep neural network (DNN)
based enhancement scheme. We show that this approach allows ML based speech
estimators to generalize quickly to unknown noise types even if only few noise
conditions have been seen during training. Further, the proposed features
outperform a competing approach where an estimate of the noise power spectral
density is appended to the noisy spectra. Instrumental measures such as
Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI) indicate strong improvements in unseen conditions when
the proposed features are used. Listening experiments confirm the improved

following aspects:(1) The linear functions are substituted for the nonlinear
exponential functions used in the previous work. This method may be more
simple, and closer to realistic equation of state\,(EoS) of a neutron star(NS),
because there are linear or quasi-linear relationships between number fractions
of leptons and matter density, which can be seen by solving NS EoS; (2)we
introduce a dimensionless variable $\varrho$\,($\varrho=\rho/\rho_0$,

simulating, we have obtained several analytical formulae for $Y_{e}$ and $\rho$

similarity scaling laws for laser plasma interaction suggest that X-rays can
drive wakefields in solid materials providing TeV/cm gradients, resulting in
electron and photon beams of extremely short duration. However, the wavelength
reduction enhances the quantum parameter $\chi$, hence opening the question of
the role of non-scalable physics, e.g., the effects of radiation reaction.
Using three dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations incorporating QED effects,
we show that for the wavelength $\lambda=5\,$nm and relativistic amplitudes
$a_0=10$-100, similarity scaling holds to a high degree, combined with
$\chi\sim 1$ operation already at moderate $a_0\sim 50$, leading to photon
emissions with energies comparable to the electron energies. Contrasting to the
generation of photons with high energies, the reduced frequency of photon
emission at X-ray wavelengths (compared to at optical wavelengths) leads to a
reduction of the amount of energy that is removed from the electron population
through radiation reaction. Furthermore, as the emission frequency approaches
the laser frequency, the importance of radiation reaction trapping as a
depletion mechanism is reduced, compared to at optical wavelengths for $a_0$
leading to similar $\chi$.

from a solid surface to environment becomes significant. Under circumstances
when the device works in rare gas environment, the scale for thermal transport
is comparable to the mean free path of molecules, and is difficult to
characterize. In this work, we present an experimental study about thermal
transport around a microwire in rare gas environment by using a steady state
hot wire method. Unlike conventional hot wire technique of using transient heat
transfer process, this method considers both the heat conduction along the wire
and convection effect from wire surface to surroundings. Convection heat
transfer coefficient from a platinum wire in diameter 25 um to air is
characterized under different heating power and air pressures to comprehend the
effect of temperature and density of gas molecules. It is observed that
convection heat transfer coefficient varies from 14 Wm-2K-1 at 7 Pa to 629
Wm-2K-1 at atmosphere pressure. In free molecule regime, Nusselt number has a
linear relationship with inverse Knudsen number and the slope of 0.274 is
employed to determined equivalent thermal dissipation boundary as 7.03E10-4 m.
In transition regime, the equivalent thermal dissipation boundary is obtained
as 5.02E10-4 m. Under a constant pressure, convection heat transfer coefficient
decreases with increasing temperature, and this correlation is more sensitive
to larger pressure. This work provides a pathway for studying both heat
conduction and heat convection effect at micro/nanoscale under rare gas
environment, the knowledge of which is essential for regulating heat
dissipation in various industrial applications.

thermodynamic macrostate depending on $\alpha$. We work out this macrostate for
several values of $\alpha$ and of the anisotropy $\Delta$ by solving the

the Hamiltonian spectrum are accessed. The two extremes are $\alpha\to\infty$
for which the thermodynamic macrostate is either the ground state or a
low-lying excited state (depending on $\Delta$) and $\alpha=0$ when the
macrostate is the infinite temperature state. The R\'enyi entropies are easily
obtained from the macrostate as function of $\alpha$ and a few interesting
limits are analytically characterised. We provide robust numerical evidence to
confirm our results using exact diagonalisation and a stochastic numerical
implementation of Bethe ansatz. Finally, using tDMRG we calculate the time

stellar wind from the companion by two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations,
we investigate the processes of wind capture by and accretion onto the black
hole. We assume that the wind acceleration is terminated at the He II
ionization front because ions responsible for line-driven acceleration are
ionized within the front, i.e. He III region. It is found that the mass
accretion rate inferred from the luminosity is remarkably smaller than the
capture rate. Considering the difference, we construct a model for the state
transition based on the accretion flow being controlled by magneto-rotational
instability. The outer flow is torus like, and plays an important role to
trigger the transition. The model can explain why state transition does occur
in Cyg X-1, while not in LMC X-1. Cyg X-1 exhibits a relatively low luminosity,
and then the He II ionization front is located and can move between the
companion and black hole, depending on its ionizing photon flux. On the other
hand, LMC X-1 exhibits too high luminosity for the front to move considerably;
the front is too close to the companion atmosphere. The model also predicts
that each state of high-soft or low-hard would last fairly long because the
luminosity depends weakly on the wind velocity. In the context of the model,
the state transition is triggered by a fluctuation of the magnetic field when
its amplitude becomes comparable to the field strength in the torus-like outer
flow.

algorithms with provable bounds on the size of the submatrix. We also present
generalizations to non-symmetric matrices, alternative sufficient conditions
for the smallest eigenvalue to exceed a desired bound that are valid for
Laplacian matrices, and a numerical evaluation.

radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere and the surface on the planet's
nightside escapes to space at narrow spectral windows of the near-infrared. The
radiation can be used to estimate winds by tracking the silhouettes of clouds
in the lower and middle cloud regions below about 57 km in altitude. Estimates
of wind speeds have ranged from 50 to 70 m/s at low to mid-latitudes, either
nearly constant across latitudes or with winds peaking at mid-latitudes. Here
we report the detection of winds at low latitude exceeding 80 m/s using IR2

angular speed around the planetary rotation axis peaks near the equator, which

M_\odot$ and the secondary mass $M_2 \sim 3-6\, M_\odot$ forms, via two
distinct evolutionary channels, a double degenerate CO-ONeMg WD system. For
sufficiently large mass ratio $q \equiv M_2/M_1 > q_{crit} \sim 0.25$ the
ensuing gravitational wave-driven mass transfer is unstable, whereby the less
massive CO WD is disrupted and transfers its mass to the primary ONeMg WD on a
few orbital time scales. The merger product ignites shell CO burning, adding
mass to the degenerate core; at the same time mass and angular momentum is lost
due to powerful winds. For an ONeMg WD sufficiently close to the Chandrasekhar
mass an electron-capture accretion induced collapse (AIC) follows $\sim 10^4$
years afterwards. We associate the prompt short GRB emission with a direct
collapse of an ONeMg WD to a neutron star, without formation of an accretion
disk. After the collapse the accretion of the unburnt part of the shell onto
the newly formed NS powers the extended emission (EE). During the collapse the
neutron star is spun to millisecond periods and produce long lasting
relativistic winds that shock against the material lost during the
shell-burning stage, and produce afterglow emission from the wind termination
shock.

mainly by the $D$-meson leading-twist distribution amplitude (DA) ,
$\phi_{2;D}$, if the proper chiral current correlation function is adopted
within the light-cone QCD sum rules. It is therefore significant to make a
comprehensive study of DA $\phi_{2;D}$ and its impact on $f^{B\to D}_+(q^2)$.
In this paper, we calculate the moments of $\phi_{2;D}$ with the QCD sum rules
under the framework of the background field theory. New sum rules for the
leading-twist DA moments $\left<\xi^n\right>_D$ up to fourth order and up to
dimension-six condensates are presented. At the scale $\mu = 2 \rm GeV$, the
values of the first four moments are: $\left<\xi^1\right>_D =
-0.418^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$, $\left<\xi^2\right>_D = 0.289^{+0.023}_{-0.022}$,
$\left<\xi^3\right>_D = -0.178 \pm 0.010$ and $\left<\xi^4\right>_D =
0.142^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$. Basing on the values of
$\left<\xi^n\right>_D(n=1,2,3,4)$, a better model of $\phi_{2;D}$ is
constructed. Applying this model for the TFF $f^{B\to D}_+(q^2)$ under the
light cone sum rules, we obtain $f^{B\to D}_+(0) = 0.673^{+0.038}_{-0.041}$ and
$f^{B\to D}_+(q^2_{\rm max}) = 1.124^{+0.053}_{-0.058}$. The uncertainty of
$f^{B\to D}_+(q^2)$ from $\phi_{2;D}$ is estimated and we find its impact
should be taken into account, especially in low and central energy region. The
branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(B\to Dl\bar{\nu}_l)$ is calculated, which is
consistent with experimental data.

However, due to the boundedness of the space domain, our variational problems
do not enjoy the usual scaling invariances which are, in general, very
important in the analysis of variational problems. To replace these scaling
arguments, we introduce new transformations which, although specific to our

incorporation of an arbitrary number of constraints, and yield a stability

research is promising to learn more accurate models at a lower cost, it is

light on when it is beneficial to apply transfer learning, we conducted an
empirical study on four popular software systems, varying software
configurations and environmental conditions, such as hardware, workload, and
software versions, to identify the key knowledge pieces that can be exploited

(e.g., homogeneous workload change), by applying a linear transformation to the
performance model, we can understand the performance behavior of the target
environment, while for severe environmental changes (e.g., drastic workload
change) we can transfer only knowledge that makes sampling more efficient,

choose the SVI direction along the surface plane, and calculate the resulting
spin orientation. This is done by changing the energy $\hbar\omega$ and
polarization angle $\alpha$ of the incoming light. The results are calculated
within a full electronic band structure scheme using the Density Functional
Theory (DFT) in the Local Density Approximation (LDA). The maxima of the
spin-velocities are reached when $\hbar\omega=0.084$\,eV and $\alpha=35^\circ$
for the Up structure, and $\hbar\omega=0.720$\,eV and $\alpha=150^\circ$ for
the Alt geometry. We find a speed of 668\,Km/s and 645\,Km/s for the Up and the
Alt structures, respectively, when the spin points perpendicularly to the
surface. Also, the response is maximized by fixing the spin-velocity direction
along a high symmetry axis, obtaining a speed of 688Km/s with the spin pointing
at $13^\circ$ from the surface normal, for the Up, and 906 Km/s and the spin
pointing at $60^\circ$ from the surface normal, for the Alt system. These speed
values are of order of magnitude larger than those of bulk semiconductors, such
as CdSe and GaAs, thus making the hydrogenated graphene structures excellent
candidates for spintronics applications.

realistic graphene material which are not accessible by numerically exact

research, because slide scanners are nowadays broadly available and because the
quantitative study of these images yields new insights in systems biology.
However, such virtual slides build up a technical challenge since the images
occupy often several gigabytes and cannot be fully opened in a computer's
memory. Moreover, there is no standard format. Therefore, most common open
source tools such as ImageJ fail at treating them, and the others require
expensive hardware while still being prohibitively slow.
  Res: We have developed several cross-platform open source software tools to
overcome these limitations. The NDPITools provide a way to transform microscopy
images initially in the loosely supported NDPI format into one or several
standard TIFF files, and to create mosaics (division of huge images into small
ones, with or without overlap) in various TIFF and JPEG formats. They can be
driven through ImageJ plugins. The LargeTIFFTools achieve similar functionality
for huge TIFF images which do not fit into RAM. We test the performance of
these tools on several digital slides and compare them, when applicable, to
standard software. A statistical study of the cells in a tissue sample from an
oligodendroglioma was performed on an average laptop computer to demonstrate
the efficiency of the tools.
  Concl: Our open source software enables dealing with huge images with
standard software on average computers. Our tools are cross-platform,
independent of proprietary libraries, and very modular, allowing them to be
used in other open source projects. They have excellent performance in terms of
execution speed and RAM requirements. They open promising perspectives both to
the clinician who wants to study a single slide and to the research team or
data centre who do image analysis of many slides on a computer cluster.

spin currents is a dynamical and long-range coupling that can drive two
magnetic layers into a collective precession when their FMR frequencies
coincide. A collective behavior is also found in magnetic trilayers with
interlayer exchange coupling (IEC). In this study we investigate the interplay
between IEC and spin pumping, using Co/Cu/Py pseudo-spin values. We employ
broadband FMR spectroscopy to explore both the frequency and coupling-strength
dependence of $\Delta H$. Our observations show that there exists a cut-off
frequency, set by the IEC strength, below which the precession is truly
collective and the spin pumping is suppressed. These results demonstrate that
it is possible to control the spin pumping efficiency by varying the frequency

decorrelation, increases linearly with the $\eta$ separation between the
intervals. The slopes for this flow decorrelation are found to be larger at
2.76 TeV than 5.02 TeV. Higher-order moments of the correlations are also
measured, and the corresponding linear coefficients for the
$k^{\textrm{th}}$-moment of the $v_n$ are found to be proportional to $k$ for
$v_3$, but not for $v_2$. The decorrelation effect is separated into
contributions from the magnitude of $v_n$ and the event-plane orientation
changing with $\eta$. These two contributions are found to be comparable. The
longitudinal flow correlations are also measured between $v_n$ of different
order in $n$. The longitudinal fluctuations of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are found to be

equilibrium temperatures lie well below the Fermi temperature of dense nuclear
matter, suggesting that the nucleons in the stars' core form Cooper pairs and
exhibit macroscopic quantum behavior. The presence of such condensates impacts
on the neutron stars' large scale properties. Specifically, superconducting
protons in the outer core (expected to show type-II properties) alter the
stars' magnetism as the magnetic field is no longer locked to the charged
plasma but instead confined to fluxtubes. The motion of these structures
governs the dynamics of the core magnetic field. To examine if field evolution
could be driven on observable timescales, several mechanisms affecting the
fluxtube distribution are addressed and characteristic timescales for realistic
equations of state estimated. The results suggest that the corresponding
timescales are not constant but vary for different densities inside the star,
generally being shortest close to the crust-core interface.

the so-called spin-orbit (SO) proximity effect in graphene adsorbed on the
Pt(111) and Ni(111)/Au semi-infinite surfaces, previously studied via spin and
angle resolved photoemission (SP-ARPES) experiments. The key finding is that,
due to the hybridization with the metal's bands, the Dirac cones manifest an
unexpectedly rich spin texture including out-of-plane and even radial in-plane
spin components at (anti)crossings where local gap openings and deviations from
linearity take place. Both the continuum character of the metallic bands and
the back folding associated to the moir\'e patterns enhance the spin texture
and induce sizable splittings which, nevertheless, only become giant (~100 meV)
at anticrossing regions; that is, where electronic transport is suppressed. At
the quasilinear regions the splitted bands typically disperse with different
broadenings and tend to cross with their magnetization continuously changing in
order to match that at the edges of the upper and lower gaps. As a result, both
the splittings and spin direction become strongly k dependent. The SO manifests
in an analogous way for the spin-polarized G/Au/Ni(111) system, although here
the magnetic exchange interactions dominate inducing small splittings (~10 meV)
in the $\pi$ bands while the SO mainly introduces a small Rashba splitting in
the Dirac cones as their magnetization acquires a helical component. While
revealing such complex spin texture seems challenging from the experimental
side, our results provide an important reference for future SP-ARPES
measurements of similar graphene based systems extensively investigated for
applications in spintronics.

sections immunostained to reveal vascular endothelial cells. But this is a
tremendous task for the pathologist and a challenge for the computer since
digitised whole tissue sections, whole slide images (WSI), contain typically
around ten gigapixels.
  We define and implement an algorithm that determines automatically, on a WSI
at objective magnification $40\times$, the regions of tissue, the regions
without blur and the regions of large puddles of red blood cells, and
constructs the mask of blur-free, significant tissue on the WSI. Then it
calibrates automatically the optical density ratios of the immunostaining of
the vessel walls and of the counterstaining, performs a colour deconvolution
inside the regions of blur-free tissue, and finds the vessel walls inside these
regions by selecting, on the image resulting from the colour deconvolution,
zones which satisfy a double-threshold criterion. A mask of vessel wall regions
on the WSI is produced. The density of microvessels is finally computed as the
fraction of the area of significant tissue which is occupied by vessel walls.
  We apply this algorithm to a set of 186 WSI of paediatric brain tumours from
World Health Organisation grades I to IV. The segmentations are of very good
quality although the set of slides is very heterogeneous. The computation time
is of the order of a fraction of an hour for each WSI on a modest computer. The
computed microvascular density is found to be robust and strongly correlates
with the tumour grade.
  This method requires no training and can easily be applied to other tumour
types and other stainings.

  SODA 2018",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC math.CO math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For even $k$, the matchings connectivity matrix $\mathbf{M}_k$ encodes which
pairs of perfect matchings on $k$ vertices form a single cycle. Cygan et al.
(STOC 2013) showed that the rank of $\mathbf{M}_k$ over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is
$\Theta(\sqrt 2^k)$ and used this to give an $O^*((2+\sqrt{2})^{\mathsf{pw}})$
time algorithm for counting Hamiltonian cycles modulo $2$ on graphs of
pathwidth $\mathsf{pw}$. The same authors complemented their algorithm by an
essentially tight lower bound under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis
(SETH). This bound crucially relied on a large permutation submatrix within
$\mathbf{M}_k$, which enabled a ""pattern propagation"" commonly used in previous
related lower bounds, as initiated by Lokshtanov et al. (SODA 2011).
  We present a new technique for a similar pattern propagation when only a
black-box lower bound on the asymptotic rank of $\mathbf{M}_k$ is given; no
stronger structural insights such as the existence of large permutation
submatrices in $\mathbf{M}_k$ are needed. Given appropriate rank bounds, our
technique yields lower bounds for counting Hamiltonian cycles (also modulo
fixed primes $p$) parameterized by pathwidth.
  To apply this technique, we prove that the rank of $\mathbf{M}_k$ over the
rationals is $4^k / \mathrm{poly}(k)$. We also show that the rank of
$\mathbf{M}_k$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $\Omega(1.97^k)$ for any prime $p\neq 2$
and even $\Omega(2.15^k)$ for some primes.
  As a consequence, we obtain that Hamiltonian cycles cannot be counted in time
$O^*((6-\epsilon)^{\mathsf{pw}})$ for any $\epsilon>0$ unless SETH fails. This
bound is tight due to a $O^*(6^{\mathsf{pw}})$ time algorithm by Bodlaender et
al. (ICALP 2013). Under SETH, we also obtain that Hamiltonian cycles cannot be
counted modulo primes $p\neq 2$ in time $O^*(3.97^\mathsf{pw})$, indicating
that the modulus can affect the complexity in intricate ways.

dynamics of poorly conducting leaky dielectric fluids under an electric field.
The TM model treats the fluids as Ohmic conductors, without modeling the
underlying ion dynamics. On the other hand, electrodiffusion models, which have
been successful in describing electrokinetic phenomena, incorporate ionic
concentration dynamics. Mathematical reconciliation of the electrodiffusion
picture and the TM model has been a major issue for electrohydrodynamic theory.
Here, we derive the TM model from an electrodiffusion model in which we
explicitly model the electrochemistry of ion dissociation. We introduce salt
dissociation reaction terms in the bulk electrodiffusion equations and take the
limit in which the salt dissociation is weak; the assumption of weak
dissociation corresponds to the fact that the TM model describes poor
conductors. Together with the assumption that the Debye length is small, we
derive the TM model with or without the surface charge convection term
depending upon the scaling of relevant dimensionless parameters. An important
quantity that emerges is the Galvani potential (GP), the jump in voltage across
the liquid-liquid interface between the two leaky dielectric media; the GP
arises as a natural consequence of the interfacial boundary conditions for the
ionic concentrations, and is absent under certain parametric conditions. When
the GP is absent, we recover the TM model. Our analysis also reveals the
structure of the Debye layer at the liquid-liquid interface, which suggests how
interfacial singularities may arise under strong imposed electric fields. In
the presence of a non-zero GP, our model predicts that the liquid droplet will
drift under an imposed electric field, the velocity of which is computed
explicitly to leading order.

superconductivity on the (001) surface of the crystalline topological
insulator(TCI) Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Te. It was shown by us in an earlier work that
a chiral p-wave finite momentum pairing (FFLO) state can be stabilized in this
system in the presence of weak repulsive interparticle interactions. In
particular, the superconducting instability is very sensitive to the Hund's
interaction in the multiorbital TCI, and no instabilities are found to be
possible for the ""wrong"" sign of the Hund's splitting. Here we show that for a
finite Hund's splitting of interactions, a significant value of the external
magnetization is needed to degrade the surface superconductivity, while in the
absence of the Hund's interaction, an arbitrarily small external magnetization
can destroy the superconductivity. This implies that multiorbital effects in
this system play an important role in stabilizing electronic order on the
surface.

to the results reported in [1]. The primary shortcoming of our first attempt,
however, was that the x-ray tube we used was capable of a maximum accelerating
potential of only 160kV, less than the 200kV used on the comparison test sample
from [1]. Thus, our results could not exclude processes initiated by x-rays
near 200 keV in energy. A second potential shortcoming was that our x-ray tube
did not have a microfocus beam, like the one used in [1]. Recently, we have
irradiated additional samples with an x-ray tube matching the specifications of
the tube used in [1]. By matching the test conditions with essentially
identical equipment, we have overcome both of the shortcomings of our previous
measurements. As before, we find no evidence of activation. The bulk of this
report, pages 2 through 35, contain the results and analysis from the first
round of testing. The extension to 200kV is found in the final appendix, namely

location of the four bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine) in a DNA
strand. As semiconductor technology revolutionized computing, modern DNA
sequencing technology (termed Next Generation Sequencing, NGS)revolutionized
genomic research. As a result, modern NGS platforms can sequence hundreds of
millions of short DNA fragments in parallel. The sequenced DNA fragments,
representing the output of NGS platforms, are termed reads. Besides genomic
variations, NGS imperfections induce noise in reads. Mapping each read to (the
most similar portion of) a reference genome of the same species, i.e., read
mapping, is a common critical first step in a diverse set of emerging
bioinformatics applications. Mapping represents a search-heavy memory-intensive
similarity matching problem, therefore, can greatly benefit from near-memory
processing. Intuition suggests using fast associative search enabled by Ternary
Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) by construction. However, the excessive
energy consumption and lack of support for similarity matching (under NGS and
genomic variation induced noise) renders direct application of TCAM infeasible,
irrespective of volatility, where only non-volatile TCAM can accommodate the
large memory footprint in an area-efficient way. This paper introduces GeNVoM,
a scalable, energy-efficient and high-throughput solution. Instead of
optimizing an algorithm developed for general-purpose computers or GPUs, GeNVoM
rethinks the algorithm and non-volatile TCAM-based accelerator design together
from the ground up. Thereby GeNVoM can improve the throughput by up to 113.5
times (3.6); the energy consumption, by up to 210.9 times (1.36), when compared
to a GPU (accelerator) baseline, which represents one of the highest-throughput
implementations known.

them. Due to the transitivity, the invariants by diffeomorphisms of an
associated bundle correspond to the real functions on the orbit space of the
action of the jet group on the typical fiber, which enables to construct the
said associated bundle.
  Scalar differential invariants are functions on bundles of jets of sections
of associated bundles, which are invariant by the standard action of local
diffeomorphisms. We show that these jet bundles are, in turn, associated
bundles with reference frame bundles of higher order. By the previous result,
this will allow to recognize scalar differential invariants as real functions
over a quotient space, regardless of the base manifold.
  We apply the above to $G$-structures, and describe their scalar differential
invariants as functions over certain quotient spaces. Each quotient space
contains a dense differentiable manifold, whose dimension is ""the number of
functionally independent scalar differential invariants"". We will obtain a
lower bound of that number and calculate it for some cases, in particular for
the scalar conformal differential invariants.

arXiv:1509.02603v2 which is based on the theory of energy operators in the
Schwartz space S^-(R) and some subspaces called energy spaces first defined in
arXiv:1208.3385 and arXiv:1308.0874. The main idea is to look for solutions of
a given linear PDE in those subspaces. Here, this work extends previous
developments in S^-(R^m) (m in Z^+) using the theory of Sobolev spaces, and in
a special case the Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we also define the concept of
""Energy Parallax"", which is the inclusion of additional solutions when varying
the energy of a predefined system locally by taking into account additional
smaller quantities. We show that it is equivalent to take into account
solutions in other energy subspaces. To illustrate the theory, one of our
examples is based on the variation of ElectroMagnetic (EM) energy density
within the skin depth of a conductive material, leading to take into account
derivatives of EM evanescent waves, particular solutions of the wave equation.
The last example is the derivation of the Woodward effect with the variations
of the EM energy density under strict assumptions in general relativity. It
finally leads to a theoretical definition of an electromagnetic and
gravitational (EMG) coupling.

protocol performances. For instance, irregularity in radio range leads to
asymmetric links that cause the loss of packets in different directions. In
order to investigate its effect, the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM) is proposed
that takes into account the irregularity of a radio range and estimates path
losses in an anisotropic environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide
details of the RIM model developed in the INET Framework of the OMNeT++
simulator that can be used to investigate the impact of radio irregularity on
protocol performance.

  Using Horn Antenna: Theory and Implementation","18 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Twisted electromagnetic waves, of which the helical phase front is called
orbital angular momentum (OAM), have been recently explored for quantum
information, high speed communication and radar detections. In this context,
generation of high purity waves carrying OAM is of great significance and
challenge from low frequency band to optical area. Here, a novel strategy of
mode combination method is proposed to generate twisted waves with arbitrary
order of OAM index. The higher order mode of a circular horn antenna is used to
generate the twisted waves with quite high purity. The proposed strategy is
verified with theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experiments. A
circular horn antenna operating at millimeter wave band is designed,
fabricated, and measured. Two twisted waves with OAM index of l=+1 and l=-1
with a mode purity as high as 87% are obtained. Compared with the other OAM
antennas, the antenna proposed here owns a high antenna gain (over 12 dBi) and
wide operating bandwidth (over 15%). The high mode purity, high antenna gain
and wide operating band make the antenna suitable for the twisted-wave
applications, not only in the microwave and millimeter wave band, but also in
the terahertz band.

structures which may be tuned during the solidification process. The range of
potential applications of freeze-cast materials is vast, and includes:
structural materials, biomaterials, filtration membranes, pharmaceuticals, and
foodstuffs. Fabrication of materials with application-specific microstructures
is possible via freeze casting, however, the templating process is highly
complex and the underlying principles are only partially understood. Here, we
report the creation of a freeze-casting experimental data repository, which
contains data extracted from ~800 different freeze-casting papers (as of August
2017). These data pertain to variables that link processing conditions to
microstructural characteristics, and finally, mechanical properties. The aim of
this work is to facilitate broad dissemination of relevant data to
freeze-casting researchers, promote better informed experimental design, and
encourage modeling efforts that relate processing conditions to microstructure
formation and material properties. An initial, systematic analysis of these
data is provided and key processing-structure-property relationships posited in
the freeze-casting literature are discussed and tested against the database.
Tools for data visualization and exploration available through the web
interface are also provided.

the induced charge and current densities as ""bound"", and therefore absorb them
into a refractive index. In principle it must also be possible to treat the
medium as vacuum, but with explicit charge and current densities. This gives a
more direct, physical description. However, since the induced waves propagate
in vacuum in this picture, it is not straightforward to realize that the
wavelength becomes different compared to that in vacuum. We provide an
explanation, and also associated time-domain simulations. As an extra bonus the
results turn out to illuminate the behavior of metamaterials.

reorientation of their spin axes. As their rotation rates are slow and their
shapes are nearly spherical, the formation of mass anomalies, by either
endogenic of exogenic processes, can change objects' moments of inertia.
Therefore, the objects reorient to align their largest moment of inertia with
their spin axis. Such phenomenon is called True Polar Wander (TPW).
  Here we report the discovery of a global series of topographic lows on
Saturn's satellite Enceladus that we interpret to show that this synchronously
locked moon has undergone TPW by ~55{\deg} about the tidal axis. We use
improved topographic data from the spherical harmonic expansion of Cassini limb
and stereogrammetric measurements to characterize regional topography over the
surface of Enceladus. We identify a group of nearly antipodal basins orthogonal
to a topographic basin chain tracing a non-equatorial circumglobal belt across
Enceladus' surface. We argue that the belt and the antipodal regions are fossil
remnants of an earlier equator and poles, respectively. We argue that these
lows arise from isostasic compensation and that their pattern reflects spatial
variations in internal dynamics of the ice shell. Our hypothesis is consistent
with a variety of geological features visible in Cassini images.

We identify
three types of classic texts: conventional, Kuhnian, and citation classics. We
find that the answer to our question depends on the definition of ""classic""
employed. First, ""citation classics"" do exist in megaproject management, and
they perform remarkably well when compared to the rest of the management
literature. A preliminary Top Ten of citation classics is presented. Second,
there is no indication that ""conventional classics"" exist in megaproject
management, i.e., texts recognized as definitive by a majority of experts.
Third, there is also no consensus as to whether ""Kuhnian classics"" exist, i.e.,
texts with paradigmatic clout. The importance of classics seems to be accepted,
however, just as work to develop, discuss, and consolidate classics is seen as
essential by megaproject scholars. A set of guidelines is presented for
developing classics in megaproject management research.
