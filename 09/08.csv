organisation. An open question is which computational (algorithmic) processes
are implemented by these hierarchies. One renowned hypothesis is that cortical
hierarchies implement a model of the world's causal structure and serve to
infer environmental states from sensory inputs. This view, which casts
perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference, has become a highly influential
concept in both basic and clinical neuroscience. So far, however, a direct
correspondence between the predicted order of hierarchical Bayesian
computations and the sequence of evoked neuronal activity has not been
demonstrated. Here, we present evidence for this correspondence from
neuroimaging and electrophysiological data in healthy volunteers. Trial-wise
sequences of hierarchical computations were inferred from participants'
behaviour during a social learning task that required multi-level inference
about intentions. We found that the temporal sequence of neuronal activity
matched the order of computations as predicted by the theory. These findings
provide strong evidence for the operation of hierarchical Bayesian inference in
human cortex. Furthermore, our approach offers a novel strategy for the
combined computational-physiological phenotyping of patients with disorders of
perception, such as schizophrenia or autism.

white dwarfs for which trigonometric parallax measurements are available. Our
aim is to compare the physical parameters derived from the spectroscopic and
photometric techniques, and then to test the theoretical mass-radius relation
for white dwarfs using these results. The agreement between spectroscopic and
photometric parameters is found to be excellent, especially for effective
temperatures, showing that our model atmospheres and fitting procedures provide
an accurate, internally consistent analysis. Values of surface gravity and
solid angle, obtained respectively from spectroscopy and photometry, are
combined with parallax measurements in various ways to study the validity of
the mass-radius relation from an empirical point of view. After a thorough
examination of our results, we find that 73% and 92% of the white dwarfs are
consistent within 1 and 2$\sigma$ confidence levels, respectively, with the
predictions of the mass-radius relation, thus providing strong support to the
theory of stellar degeneracy. Our analysis also allows us to identify 15 stars
that are better interpreted in terms of unresolved double degenerate binaries.
Atmospheric parameters for both components in these binary systems are obtained
using a novel approach. We further identify a few white dwarfs that are
possibly composed of an iron core rather than a carbon/oxygen core, since they
are consistent with Fe-core evolutionary models.

the next-to-leading order radiative corrections to the two neutral CP-even

the large logarithmic squark contributions and allows to keep under control the

opto-electronic device applications. For the purpose, we employed a correlated
electron methodology based upon the Pariser-Parr-Pople model Hamiltonian,
coupled with the configuration interaction (CI) approach, and studied
structures containing up to 42 carbon atoms. Our calculations, based upon
large-scale CI expansions, reveal that the linear structures have intense
optical absorption at the HOMO-LUMO gap, while the graphyne ones have those at
higher energies. Thus, the opto-electronic properties depend on the topology of
the {graphyne substructures, suggesting that they can be tuned by means of
structural modifications. Our results are in very good agreement with the
available experimental data.

the shape of suspended particles. Experiments with prolate ellipsoidal
particles suggest that the spatiotemporal properties of the deposit depend
strongly on particle aspect ratio. As the aspect ratio increases, the particles
form less densely-packed deposits and the statistical behavior of the deposit
interface crosses over from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class to
another universality class which was suggested to be consistent with the KPZ
plus quenched disorder. Here, we numerically study the effect of particle
interaction anisotropy on deposit growth. In essence, we model the ellipsoids,
at the interface, as disk-like particles with two types of interaction patches
that correspond to specific features at the poles and equator of the ellipsoid.
The numerical results corroborate experimental observations and further suggest
that the deposition transition can stem from interparticle interaction
anisotropy. Possible extensions of our model to other systems are also
discussed.

understand their transport behavior. In a quantitative, set-oriented approach
to transport and mixing, finite time coherent sets play an important role.
These are time-parametrized families of sets with unlikely transport to and
from their surroundings under small or vanishing random perturbations of the
dynamics. Here we propose, as a measure of transport and mixing for purely
advective (i.e., deterministic) flows, (semi)distances that arise under
vanishing perturbations in the sense of large deviations. Analogously, for
given finite Lagrangian trajectory data we derive a discrete-time and space
semidistance that comes from the ""best"" approximation of the randomly perturbed
process conditioned on this limited information of the deterministic flow. It
can be computed as shortest path in a graph with time-dependent weights.
Furthermore, we argue that coherent sets are regions of maximal farness in
terms of transport and mixing, hence they occur as extremal regions on a
spanning structure of the state space under this semidistance---in fact, under
any distance measure arising from the physical notion of transport. Based on
this notion we develop a tool to analyze the state space (or the finite
trajectory data at hand) and identify coherent regions. We validate our
approach on idealized prototypical examples and well-studied standard cases.

a second ultraviolet conformal window in the number of flavours vs colours
phase diagram. We first review the state-of-the-art for the large $N_f$ beta
function and then estimate the lower boundary of the ultraviolet window. The
theories belonging to this new region are examples of safe non-abelian quantum
electro dynamics, termed here {\it safe QCD}. Therefore, according to Wilson,
they are fundamental. An important critical quantity is the fermion mass
anomalous dimension at the ultraviolet fixed point that we determine at leading
order in $1/N_f$. We discover that its value is comfortably below the bootstrap
bound. We also investigate the abelian case and find that at the potential
ultraviolet fixed point the related fermion mass anomalous dimension has a

the $H(z)$ and the Type Ia supernova data we find that the $H(z)$/SNIa overall

microwave sensor design. Recent attempts to improve these properties have
relied on metamaterial- (MTM-) inspired open-loop resonators (OLRs) coupled to
transmission lines (TLs). Although the strongly resonant properties of the OLR
sensitively reflect small changes in the environment through a shift in its
resonance frequency, the resulting sensitivities remain ultimately limited by
the level of coupling between the OLR and the TL. This work introduces a novel
solution to this problem that employs negative-refractiveindex TL (NRI-TL) MTMs
to substantially improve this coupling so as to fully exploit its resonant
properties. A MTM-infused planar microwave sensor is designed for operation at
2.5 GHz, and is shown to exhibit a significant improvement in sensitivity and
linearity. A rigorous signal-flow analysis (SFA) of the sensor is proposed and
shown to provide a fully analytical description of all salient features of both
the conventional and MTM-infused sensors. Full-wave simulations confirm the
analytical predictions, and all data demonstrate excellent agreement with
measurements of a fabricated prototype. The proposed device is shown to be
especially useful in the characterization of commonly-available
high-permittivity liquids as well as in sensitively distinguishing

context of the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. We investigate
the ranges of the EMPG parameters $(\alpha,\eta)$ on theoretical as well as
observational grounds leading to the late-time acceleration of the Universe
with pressureless matter only, while keeping the successes of standard general
relativity at early times. We find that $\eta=0$ corresponds to the
$\Lambda$CDM model, whereas $\eta\neq 0$ leads to a $w$CDM-type model. However,
the underlying physics of the EMPG model is entirely different in the sense
that the energy in the EMPG Universe is sourced by pressureless matter only.
Moreover, the energy of the pressureless matter is not conserved, namely, in
general it does not dilute as $\rho\propto a^{-3}$ with the expansion of the
Universe. Finally, we constrain the parameters of an EMPG-based cosmology with
a recent compilation of 28 Hubble parameter measurements, and find that this
model describes an evolution of the Universe similar to that in the
$\Lambda$CDM model. We briefly discuss that EMPG can be unified with
Starobinsky gravity to describe the complete history of the Universe including
the inflationary era.

the brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can
reveal patterns of disease propagation. On the other hand, intra-subject
descriptions cannot exploit the whole information context, accessible through
inter-subject comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel approach,
which models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and
summarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset
multiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC),
AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD
(cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, $0.86 \pm 0.01$ and $0.84 \pm 0.01$.
The model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling
the brain in equal volumes of $3000$ $mm^3$ (""patches""), without any $a$
$priori$ segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to
standard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex
network approach had higher sensitivity. This method is general and can have
twofold potential applications: providing a reliable tool for clinical trials
and a disease signature of neurodegenerative pathologies.

propose that these textures can be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurements carried out in the presence of an electric field. In crystals with
hidden polarizations, a uniform electric field produces a staggered magnetic
field that points to opposite directions at atomic sites related by spatial
inversion. As a result, the NMR resonance peak corresponding to inversion
partner nuclei is split into two peaks. The magnitude of the splitting is
proportional to the electric field and depends on the orientation of the
electric field with respect to the crystallographic axes and the external
magnetic field. As a case study, we present a theory of electric-field-induced
splitting of NMR peaks for $^{77}$Se, $^{125}$Te and $^{209}$Bi in Bi$_2$Se$_3$

10^6\, {\rm A/cm}^2$, the splitting for Bi can reach $100\, {\rm kHz}$, which
is comparable to or larger than the intrinsic width of the NMR lines. In order
to observe the effect experimentally, the peak splitting must also exceed the
linewidth produced by the Oersted field. In Bi$_2$Se$_3$, this requires narrow
wires of radius $\lesssim 1\, \mu{\rm m}$. We also discuss other potentially
more promising candidate materials, such as SrRuO$_3$ and BaIr$_2$Ge$_2$, whose

1950's, driven by a maturing technology base and an expanding community of
researchers. This advancement has shown that observations at far-infrared
wavelengths are important in nearly all areas of astrophysics, from the search
for habitable planets and the origin of life, to the earliest stages of galaxy
assembly in the first few hundred million years of cosmic history. The
combination of a still developing portfolio of technologies, particularly in
the field of detectors, and a widening ensemble of platforms within which these
technologies can be deployed, means that far-infrared astronomy holds the
potential for paradigm-shifting advances over the next decade. In this review,
we examine current and future far-infrared observing platforms, including
ground-based, sub-orbital, and space-based facilities, and discuss the
technology development pathways that will enable and enhance these platforms to
best address the challenges facing far-infrared astronomy in the 21st century.

contact when the interaction rate becomes smaller than the Hubble expansion
rate. After decoupling, two subsystems are usually treated separately in
accordance with equilibrium thermodynamics and the thermodynamic entropy gives
a fiducial quantity conserved in each subsystem. In this paper, we discuss a
correction to this paradigm from quantum entanglement of two coupled fields.
The thermodynamic entropy is generalized to the entanglement entropy. We
formulate a perturbation theory to derive the entanglement entropy and present
Feynman rules in diagrammatic calculations. For specific models to illustrate
our formulation, an interacting scalar-scalar system, quantum electrodynamics,
and the Yukawa theory are considered. We calculate the entanglement entropy in
these models and find a quantum correction to the thermodynamic entropy. The
correction is revealed to be important in circumstances of instantaneous
decoupling.

remain difficult to observe directly. Gas accreting from the disc on to the
star provides a way to measure the elemental abundances because even refractory
species are in an atomic gaseous form. Here we compare the abundance ratios
derived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of
disc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of
abundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to
have lower Si emission. Since this can naturally be explained by the suppressed
accretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least
partially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios. Our models of
disc evolution due to grain growth, radial drift and the flux of volatile
species carried as ices on grain surfaces, give rise to a partial sorting of
the atomic species based on the volatility of their dominant molecular
carriers. This arises because volatiles are left behind at their snow lines
while the grains continue to drift. We show that this reproduces the main
features seen in the accretion line ratio data, such as C/N ratios that are a
few times solar and the correlation between the Si to volatile ratio with
mm-flux. We highlight the fact that developing a more robust linkage between
line ratios and abundance ratios and acquiring data for larger samples has the
potential to cast considerable light on the chemical history of protoplanetary
discs.

interactions consistent with the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) may lead to
effective field theories parametrically violating WGC constraints. The minimal
examples typically involve Higgs scalars with a large charge with respect to a
$U(1)$ (e.g. charges $(Z,1)$ in $U(1)^2$ with $Z\gg 1$). This type of Higgs
multiplets play also a key role in clockwork $U(1)$ theories. We study these
issues in the context of heterotic string theory and find that, while indeed
there is no new physics at the standard magnetic WGC scale $\Lambda\sim g_{IR}
M_P$, the string scale is just slightly above, at a scale $\sim
\sqrt{k_{IR}}\Lambda$. Here $k_{IR}$ is the level of the IR $U(1)$ worldsheet
current. We show that, unlike the standard magnetic cutoff, this bound is
insensitive to subsequent Higgsing. One may argue that this constraint gives
rise to no bound at the effective field theory level since $k_0$ is model
dependent and in general unknown. However there is an additional constraint to
be taken into account, which is that the Higgsing scalars with large charge $Z$
should be part of the string massless spectrum, which becomes an upper bound
$k_{IR}\leq k_0^2$, where $k_0$ is the level of the UV currents. Thus, for
fixed $k_0$, $Z$ cannot be made parametrically large. The upper bound on the
charges $Z$ leads to limitations on the size and structure of hierarchies in an
iterated $U(1)$ clockwork mechanism.

The DSC in our simulations reproduces the spatial distribution of the observed

For galaxy clusters and groups we find that, although the DSC in almost all

stripes upon hole-doping. The similarities of these findings to experimental
results on both electron and hole-doped cuprate families support a unified

instruments that achieve extremely high contrast at small planet-to-star

technique, providing excellent contrast and throughput for off-axis sources on
clear apertures. However, the complexity of space- and ground-based telescope
apertures goes on increasing over time, owing to the combination of primary
mirror segmentation, secondary mirror, and support structures. These
discontinuities in the telescope aperture limit the coronagraph performance. In
this paper, we present ACAD-OSM, a novel active method to correct for the
diffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a
coronagraph. Active methods use one or several deformable mirrors that are
controlled with an interaction matrix to correct for the aberrations in the
pupil. However, they are often limited by the amount of aberrations introduced
by aperture discontinuities. This algorithm relies on the recalibration of the
interaction matrix during the correction process to overcome this limitation.
We first describe the ACAD-OSM technique and compare it to the previous active
methods for the correction of aperture discontinuities. We then show its
performance in terms of contrast and off-axis throughput for static aperture
discontinuities (segmentation, struts) and for some aberrations evolving over
the life of the instrument (residual phase aberrations, artifacts in the
aperture, misalignments in the coronagraph design). This technique can now
obtain the earth-like planet detection threshold of 10^(-10) contrast on any

many rigid particles of arbitrary shape suspended in a fluctuating fluid. Our
method adds Brownian motion to the rigid multiblob method at a cost comparable
to the cost of deterministic simulations. We demonstrate that we can
efficiently generate deterministic and random displacements for many particles
using preconditioned Krylov iterative methods, if kernel methods to efficiently
compute the action of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) mobility matrix and it
""square"" root are available for the given boundary conditions. We address a
major challenge in large-scale BD simulations, capturing the stochastic drift
term that arises because of the configuration-dependent mobility. Unlike the
widely-used Fixman midpoint scheme, our methods utilize random finite
differences and do not require the solution of resistance problems or the
computation of the action of the inverse square root of the RPY mobility
matrix. We construct two temporal schemes which are viable for large scale
simulations, an Euler-Maruyama traction scheme and a Trapezoidal Slip scheme,
which minimize the number of mobility solves per time step while capturing the
required stochastic drift terms. We validate and compare these schemes
numerically by modeling suspensions of boomerang shaped particles sedimented
near a bottom wall. Using the trapezoidal scheme, we investigate the
steady-state active motion in a dense suspensions of confined microrollers,
whose height above the wall is set by a combination of thermal noise and active
flows. We find the existence of two populations of active particles, slower
ones closer to the bottom and faster ones above them, and demonstrate that our
method provides quantitative accuracy even with relatively coarse resolutions
of the particle geometry.

  It follows that a hypothetical fast algorithm for computing the number of

fast test for whether $N$ is squarefree. We also show how to obtain bounds on

the number of such Hecke newforms for even a single weight $k$, then we show

Changes in atmospheric nitrogen (i.e. atmospheric mass) have direct effects on
climate and biological productivity. It is difficult to constrain, however, the
evolution of the major nitrogen reservoirs through time. Here we show a secular
increase in continental crust nitrogen through Earth history recorded in
glacial tills (2.9 Ga to modern), which act as a proxy for average upper
continental crust composition. Archean and earliest Palaeoproterozoic tills
contain 66 $\pm$ 100 ppm nitrogen, whereas Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic tills
contain 290 $\pm$ 165 ppm nitrogen, whilst the isotopic composition has
remained constant at ~4$\permil$. Nitrogen has accumulated in the continental

conversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of
these stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new
mechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher
spin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin
distributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue
some massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black
holes. Besides, we extend the concept of critical mass $M_{\rm cr}$ for the
neutron star sequence (Berezhiani et al. 2003; Bombaci et al. 2004) to the case
of fast-spinning neutron stars, and point out that neutron star EoS models

running time distribution of a mortal random walker, the MSD is tempered by the
stopping rate $\theta$. This provides a physical interpretation for truncated

attained. Such SDPs are both theoretically interesting and often impossible to
solve; yet, the pathological SDPs in the literature look strikingly similar.

The normal form is constructed in a surprisingly simple fashion, using mostly

increase the number of galaxy clusters beyond the SDSS-limit, z ~ 0.75.
Methods: We compiled a list of extended X-ray sources from the 2XMMp catalogue

counterpart were selected for further investigation. Deep optical imaging and
follow-up spectroscopy were obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope,
Arizona (LBT), of those candidates not known to the literature. Results: From

abnormal accumulation of proteins and organelles in axons is a hallmark feature
of these diseases. The diffusion in the axons can become to anomalous as a
result from this abnormality. In this case the voltage propagation in axons is
affected. Another hallmark feature of different neurodegenerative diseases is
given by discrete swellings along the axon. In order to model the voltage
propagation in axons with anomalous diffusion and swellings, in this paper we
propose a fractional cable equation for general geometry. This generalized
equation depends on fractional parameters and geometric quantities such as the
curvature and torsion of the cable. For a cable with a constant radius we show
that the voltage decreases when the fractional effect increases. In cables with
swellings we find that when the fractional effect or the swelling radius
increase, the voltage decreases. A similar behavior is obtained when the number
of swellings and the fractional effect increase. Moreover, we find that when
the radius swelling (or the number of swellings) and the fractional effect
increase at the same time, the voltage dramatically decreases.

rotating relativistic stars affected by radiation-driven
Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability. This approach is based on the
multipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global
physical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),
but not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It
leads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes
and the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The
approach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS
instability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission
removes angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation
energy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount
of the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly
rotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of
gravitational waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the
arguments by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), but in contrast to widely accepted
equations by Lindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000), there effective spin
frequency decrease is coupled with dissipation of unstable mode. This problem,
initially stressed by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), is shown to be superficial,
and arises as a result of definition of the effective spin frequency by
Lindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000). Namely, it is shown, that if this
definition is taken into account properly, the evolution equations coincide
with obtained here in the leading order in mode amplitude. I also argue that
the next-to-leading order terms in evolution equations (which differ for Owen
et al. 1998 and Ho & Lai 2000) require clarification and thus it would be more
self-consistent to omit them.

These are
still open questions in solar physics. Helio- and asteroseismology can help
answer them by enabling us to study solar and stellar internal structures
through global oscillations. The properties of solar and stellar acoustic modes
are changing with the level of magnetic activity. However, until now, the
inference on subsurface magnetic fields with seismic measures has been very
limited. The aim of this paper is to develop a formalism to calculate the
effect of large-scale toroidal magnetic fields on solar and stellar global
oscillation eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies. If the Lorentz force is added
to the equilibrium equation of motion, stellar eigenmodes can couple. In
quasi-degenerate perturbation theory, this coupling, also known as the direct
effect, can be quantified by the general matrix element. We present the
analytical expression of the matrix element for a superposition of subsurface
zonal toroidal magnetic field configurations. The matrix element is important
for forward calculations of perturbed solar and stellar eigenfunctions and
frequency perturbations. The results presented here will help to ascertain
solar and stellar large-scale subsurface magnetic fields, and their geometric
configuration, strength, and their change over the course of activity cycles.

Intuitively, the current 'best' (classifier, detector) pair is application

builds on this observation. We introduce the $\mbox{Tornado}$ framework that
implements a reservoir of diverse classifiers, together with a variety of drift
detection algorithms. In our framework, all (classifier, detector) pairs
proceed, in parallel, to construct models against the evolving data streams. At
any point in time, we select the pair which currently yields the best
performance. We further incorporate two novel stacking-based drift detection
methods, namely the $\mbox{FHDDMS}$ and $\mbox{FHDDMS}_{add}$ approaches. The
experimental evaluation confirms that the current 'best' (classifier, detector)
pair is not only heavily dependent on the characteristics of the stream, but
also that this selection evolves as the stream flows. Further, our
$\mbox{FHDDMS}$ variants detect concept drifts accurately in a timely fashion

different people can lead to poor clustering results. This suggests clustering
using a verification system with very few false positives but perhaps moderate
recall. We introduce a novel verification method, rank-1 counts verification,
that has this property, and use it in a link-based clustering scheme. Finally,
we define a novel end-to-end detection and clustering evaluation metric

Goldschmidt et al., PRL 116, 113001 (2016)]. Such broadening has serious
implications for many proposals to coherently use Rydberg interactions,
particularly Rydberg dressing proposals. The dephasing arises as a runaway
process where the production of the first contaminant atoms facilitates the
creation of more contaminant atoms. Here we study the time dependence of this
process with stroboscopic approaches. Using a pump-probe technique, we create
an excess ""pump"" Rydberg population and probe its effect with a different
""probe"" Rydberg transition. We observe a reduced resonant pumping rate and an
enhancement of the excitation on both sides of the transition as atoms are
added to the pump state. We also observe a timescale for population growth
significantly shorter than predicted by homogeneous mean-field models, as
expected from a clustered growth mechanism where high-order correlations
dominate the dynamics. These results support earlier works and confirm that the
time scale for the onset of dephasing is reduced by a factor which scales as
the inverse of the atom number. In addition, we discuss several approaches to
minimize these effects of spontaneous broadening, including stroboscopic
techniques and operating at cryogenic temperatures. It is challenging to avoid
the unwanted broadening effects, but under some conditions they can be
mitigated.

intensity difference is proposed for content based image retrieval (CBIR). For
computation of texture features like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), the center
pixel in a 3*3 window of an image is compared with all the remaining neighbors,
one pixel at a time to generate a binary bit pattern. It ignores the effect of
the adjacent neighbors of a particular pixel for its binary encoding and also
for texture description. The proposed method is based on the concept that
neighbors of a particular pixel hold a significant amount of texture
information that can be considered for efficient texture representation for
CBIR. Taking this into account, we develop a new texture descriptor, named as
Local Neighborhood Intensity Pattern (LNIP) which considers the relative
intensity difference between a particular pixel and the center pixel by
considering its adjacent neighbors and generate a sign and a magnitude pattern.
Since sign and magnitude patterns hold complementary information to each other,
these two patterns are concatenated into a single feature descriptor to
generate a more concrete and useful feature descriptor. The proposed descriptor
has been tested for image retrieval on four databases, including three texture
image databases - Brodatz texture image database, MIT VisTex database and
Salzburg texture database and one face database AT&T face database. The
precision and recall values observed on these databases are compared with some
state-of-art local patterns. The proposed method showed a significant
improvement over many other existing methods.

long been known. The recently discovered universal I-Love-Q relations, which
connect moment of inertia, quadrupole tidal Love number, and spin-induced
quadrupole moment of compact stars, also underscore the special role of tidal
deformation in gravitational wave astronomy. Motivated by the observation that
such relations also prevail in Newtonian stars and crucially depend on the
stiffness of a star, we consider the tidal Love numbers of Newtonian polytropic
stars whose stiffness is characterised by a polytropic index $n$. We first
perturbatively solve the Lane-Emden equation governing the profile of
polytropic stars through the application of the scaled delta expansion method
and then formulate perturbation series for the multipolar tidal Love number
about the two exactly solvable cases with $n=0$ and $n=1$, respectively. Making
use of these two series to form a two-point Pad\'e approximant, we find an
approximate expression of the quadrupole tidal Love number, whose error is less
than $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ per cent (0.39 per cent) for $n\in[0,1]$
($n\in[0,3]$). Similarly, we also determine the mass moments for polytropic
stars accurately. Based on these findings, we are able to show that the
I-Love-Q relations are in general stationary about the incompressible limit
irrespective of the equation of state (EOS) of a star. Moreover, for the
I-Love-Q relations, there is a secondary stationary point near $n \approx
0.4444$, thus showing the insensitivity to $n$ for $n\in[0,1]$. Our
investigation clearly tracks the universality of the I-Love-Q relations from
their validity for stiff stars such as neutron stars to their breakdown for
soft stars.

models is critical to evaluate the data dissemination in OppNets. One of the
mobility models that is available in OMNeT++ which can be used to mimic human
movement patterns is Small Worlds in Motion (SWIM). The SWIM model is based on
the intuition that humans often visit nearby locations and if the visited
location is far away, then it is probably due to the popularity of the
location. As an alternative to mobility of a node, pairwise contact
probabilities are also used to evaluate the data dissemination in OppNets.
Pairwise contact probabilities can be used to predict that a node will be met
by a particular node. These probabilities can be derived in many ways. One of
the ways is to calculate the average probability with which a node will meet
another particular node at any point of time. Another way is to calculate the
probability with which a node will meet another based on the time of day. The
way of calculating pairwise contact probability depends on the scenario. In
this work, the pairwise contact probabilities obtained from the real traces are
used to tune the parameters of the SWIM mobility model. The traces and the SWIM

impact on the covariance within the survey window. The supersample covariance
has been recognized as an important source of covariance for the power spectrum
on small scales, and it can potentially be important for the bispectrum
covariance as well. In this paper, using the response function formalism, we
model the supersample covariance contributions to the bispectrum covariance and
the cross covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum. The
supersample covariances due to the long wavelength density and tidal
perturbations are investigated, and the tidal contribution is a few orders of
magnitude smaller than the density one because in configuration space the
bispectrum estimator involves angular averaging and the tidal response function
is anisotropic. The impact of the super-survey modes is quantified using
numerical measurements with periodic box and subbox setups. For the matter
bispectrum, the ratio between the supersample covariance correction and the
small scale covariance, which can be computed using a periodic box, is roughly
an order of magnitude smaller than that for the matter power spectrum. This is
because for the bispectrum, the small scale non-Gaussian covariance is
significantly larger than that for the power spectrum. For the cross
covariance, the supersample covariance is as important as for the power
spectrum covariance. The supersample covariance prediction with the halo model
response function is in good agreement with numerical results.

decline rates, magnitudes, time durations, and environment metallicity. Our
sample displays a large range in ejecta expansion velocities, from $\sim9600$
to $\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$ at 50 days post explosion with a median H$_{\alpha}$
value of 7300 km s$^{-1}$. This is most likely explained through differing
explosion energies. Significant diversity is also observed in the absolute
strength of spectral lines, characterised through their pseudo-equivalent
widths. This implies significant diversity in both temperature evolution

scalable iterative first-order methods for these problems, and show that these
iterative methods can be viewed through the lens of online convex optimization
(OCO). The standard OCO framework has seen much success for its ability to
handle decision-making in dynamic, uncertain, and even adversarial
environments. Nevertheless, our applications of interest present further
flexibility in OCO via three simple modifications to standard OCO assumptions:
we introduce two new concepts of weighted regret and online saddle point
problems and study the possibility of making lookahead (anticipatory)
decisions. Our analyses demonstrate that these flexibilities introduced into
the OCO framework have significant consequences whenever they are applicable.
For example, in the strongly convex case, minimizing unweighted regret has a
proven optimal bound of $O(\log(T)/T)$, whereas we show that a bound of
$O(1/T)$ is possible when we consider weighted regret. Similarly, for the
smooth case, considering $1$-lookahead decisions results in a $O(1/T)$ bound,
compared to $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ in the standard OCO setting. Consequently, these
OCO tools are instrumental in exploiting structural properties of functions and
resulting in improved convergence rates for RO and JEO. In certain cases, our
results for RO and JEO match the best known or optimal rates in the
corresponding problem classes without data uncertainty.

the thickenings satisfy metric analogues of Hausmann's theorem and the nerve
lemma (the metric Vietoris--Rips and \v{C}ech thickenings of $X$ are homotopy
equivalent to $X$ for scale parameters less than the reach). To our knowledge
this is the first version of Hausmann's theorem for Euclidean submanifolds (as
opposed to Riemannian manifolds), and our result also extends to non-manifold
shapes (as not all sets of positive reach are manifolds). In contrast to
Hausmann's original proof, our homotopy equivalence is a deformation
retraction, is realized by canonical maps in both directions, and furthermore
can be proven to be a homotopy equivalence via simple linear homotopies from
the map compositions to the corresponding identity maps.

authors, the ordered AFM phases already show in band theory significant band
gaps. However, for the disordered PM phases the commonly used band model has
been to assume the macroscopically observed, averaged NaCl structure, where all
transition metal sites are forced to be symmetry-equivalent (a monomorphous
description); for the PM phase this forces zero moment on an atom by atom
basis, thus producing a gapless PM state, in sharp conflict with experiment.
Instead, we allow larger NaCl-type supercells where each TM site can have
different local bonding and spin environments (a polymorphous description) and
thus the geometric flexibility to acquire symmetry-lowering distortions that
lower the total energy and can break the symmetry of the d orbitals. The
existence of a distribution of different local spin and bonding environments
allows large on-site magnetic moments to develop spontaneously in the DFT+U
calculations leading to significant (1-3 eV) band gaps in the AFM, FM, and PM
phases of the classic Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. We adapt to the
spin disordered configurations in the PM phases the ""special quasi-random
structure"" whereby supercell approximants which represent the best random
configuration average for finite supercells of a given lattice symmetry are
constructed. Thus, avoiding a monomorphous description of the disordered
magnetic phases allows even ordinary DFT+U, which represents the N electron
system with a single-determinant wavefunction, to describe the gapping not only
in the AFM phases but also in the PM phases of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO.

computation of the spherical harmonic transform (SHT) associated with the
optimal-dimensionality sampling requires the inversion of a series of linear
systems in an iterative manner. The stability of the inversion depends on the
placement of iso-latitude rings of samples along co-latitude. In this work, we
have developed a method to place these iso-latitude rings of samples with the
objective of improving the well-conditioning of the linear systems involved in
the computation of the SHT. We also propose a multi-pass SHT algorithm to
iteratively improve the accuracy of the SHT of band-limited signals.
Furthermore, we review the changes in the computational complexity and
improvement in accuracy of the SHT with the embedding of the proposed methods.
Through numerical experiments, we illustrate that the proposed variations and
improvements in the SHT algorithm corresponding to the optimal-dimensionality

equivalent channel matrix will no longer spread with the increase of the
Doppler spread once the length of maximum channel delay spread and the OTFS

equalized using the conventional OFDM single- tap equalizer in the frequency

useful tool for sparse classification, it suffers from inefficacy in dealing
with high dimensional features and manually set initial regressor values. This
has significantly constrained its applications for hyperspectral image (HSI)
classification. In order to tackle these two drawbacks, an extreme sparse
multinomial logistic regression (ESMLR) is proposed for effective
classification of HSI. First, the HSI dataset is projected to a new feature
space with randomly generated weight and bias. Second, an optimization model is
established by the Lagrange multiplier method and the dual principle to
automatically determine a good initial regressor for SMLR via minimizing the
training error and the regressor value. Furthermore, the extended
multi-attribute profiles (EMAPs) are utilized for extracting both the spectral
and spatial features. A combinational linear multiple features learning (MFL)
method is proposed to further enhance the features extracted by ESMLR and
EMAPs. Finally, the logistic regression via the variable splitting and the
augmented Lagrangian (LORSAL) is adopted in the proposed framework for reducing
the computational time. Experiments are conducted on two well-known HSI
datasets, namely the Indian Pines dataset and the Pavia University dataset,
which have shown the fast and robust performance of the proposed ESMLR

interaction $V|r_1r_2\rangle\langle r_1r_3|+$H.c., where $|r_i\rangle$ is a
state that can be excited from a qubit state and $V$ is adjustable. We present
two protocols of $\mathbb{B}$. The first~(second) protocol consists of
two~(six) pulses and one~(two) wait period(s), where the former causes
rotations between the qubit states and excited states, and the latter induces
gate transformation via the non-collinear interaction. In the first protocol,
the variable $\phi$ can be tuned by varying phases of external controls, and
the other two variables $\alpha$ and $\theta$, tunable via adjusting the wait
duration, have a linear dependence upon each other. Meanwhile, the first
protocol can give rise to the CNOT and Controlled-Y gates. In the second
protocol, $\alpha,\theta$, and $\phi$ can be varied by changing the interaction
amplitudes and wait durations, and the latter two are dependent on $\alpha$
non-linearly. Both protocols can also lead to another universal gate when
$\{\alpha,\phi\}=\{1/4,1/2\}\pi$ with appropriate parameters. Implementation of
these universal gates is analyzed based on the van der Waals interaction of

1749+096 observed in 2008--2015. The degree of polarization (PD) tends to
increase in short flares having a time-scale of a few days. The object favors a
polarization angle (PA) of $40^\circ$--$50^\circ$ at the flare maxima, which is
close to the position angle of the jet ($20^\circ$--$40^\circ$). Three clear
polarization rotations were detected in the negative PA direction associated
with flares. In addition, a rapid and large decrease in the PA was observed in
the other two flares, while another two flares showed no large PA variation.
The light curve maxima of the flares possibly tend to lag behind the PD maxima
and color-index minima. The PA became $-50^\circ$ to $-20^\circ$ in the decay
phase of active states, which is almost perpendicular to the jet position
angle. We propose a scenario to explain these observational features, where
transverse shocks propagate along curved trajectories. The favored PA at the
flare maxima suggests that the observed variations were governed by the
variations in the Doppler factor, $\delta$. Based on this scenario, the minimum
viewing angle of the source, $\theta_\mathrm{min}=4.8^\circ$--$6.6^\circ$, and
the location of the source, $\Delta r\gtrsim 0.1$pc, from the central black
hole were estimated. In addition, the acceleration of electrons by the shock
and synchrotron cooling would have a time-scale similar to that of the change
in $\delta$. The combined effect of the variation in $\delta$ and
acceleration/cooling of electrons is probably responsible for the observed
diversity of the polarization variations in the flares.

using the upper limits obtained by ALMA in combination with the rest-frame
UV--optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For SED fitting, because of
degeneracy between dust extinction and stellar age, we focus on two extremes:
continuous star formation (Model A) and instantaneous star formation (Model B).
We apply these models to Himiko (as a representative UV-bright object) and a
composite SED of $z>5$ Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). For Himiko, Model A
requires a significant dust extinction, which leads to a high dust temperature
$>70$ K for consistency with the ALMA upper limit. This high dust temperature
puts a strong upper limit on the total dust mass $M_\mathrm{d}\lesssim 2\times
10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, and the dust mass produced per supernova (SN)
$m_\mathrm{d,SN}\lesssim 0.1$ M$_{\odot}$. Such a low $m_\mathrm{d,SN}$
suggests significant loss of dust by reverse shock destruction or outflow, and
implies that SNe are not the dominant source of dust at high $z$. Model B
allows $M_\mathrm{d}\sim 2\times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and $m_\mathrm{d,SN}\sim
0.3$ M$_{\odot}$.} We could distinguish between Models A and B if we observe
Himiko at {wavelength $<$ 1.2 mm by ALMA. For the LBG sample, we obtain
$M_\mathrm{d}\lesssim 2\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ for a typical LBG at $z>5$, but
this only puts an upper limit for $m_\mathrm{d,SN}$ as $\sim 2$ M$_{\odot}$.
This clarifies the importance of observing UV-bright objects (like Himiko) to
constrain the dust production by SNe.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has been proved effective for
reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. However, the maximum number
of independent data streams is conventionally restricted by the number of RF
chains, which leads to limiting the spatial multiplexing gain. To further
improve the achievable spectral efficiency (SE), in this paper we propose a
novel generalized spatial modulation (GenSM) aided mmWave MIMO system to convey
an extra data stream via the index of the active antennas group, while no extra
RF chain is required. Moreover, we also propose a hybrid analog and digital
precoding scheme for SE maximization. More specifically, a closed-form lower
bound is firstly derived to quantify the achievable SE of the proposed system.
By utilizing this lower bound as the cost function, a two-step algorithm is
proposed to optimize the hybrid precoder. The proposed algorithm not only
utilizes the concavity of the cost function over the digital power allocation
vector, but also invokes the convex $\ell_\infty$ relaxation to handle the
non-convex constraint imposed by analog precoding. Finally, the proposed scheme
is shown via simulations to outperform state-of-the-art mmWave MIMO schemes in

indexes that typically integrate a spatial index with a textual index. However,
these indexes usually have a high demand for main-memory and assume that the
entire vocabulary of keywords is known in advance. Also, these indexes do not
successfully capture the variations in the frequencies of keywords across
different spatial regions and treat frequent and infrequent keywords in the
same way. Moreover, existing indexes do not adapt to the changes in workload
over space and time. For example, some keywords may be trending at certain
times in certain locations and this may change as time passes. This affects the
indexing and searching performance of existing indexes significantly. In this
paper, we introduce FAST, a Frequency-Aware Spatio-Textual index for continuous

third of the memory needed by the state-of-the-art index. FAST does not assume
prior knowledge of the entire vocabulary of indexed objects. FAST adaptively
accounts for the difference in the frequencies of keywords within their

micro-blogging and social networking applications, e.g., Twitter and Facebook,
has resulted in the generation of huge streams of geo-tagged textual data. Many
applications require real-time processing of these streams. For example,
location-based e-coupon and ad-targeting systems enable advertisers to register
millions of ads to millions of users. The number of users is typically very
high and they are continuously moving, and the ads change frequently as well.
Hence sending the right ad to the matching users is very challenging. Existing
streaming systems are either centralized or are not spatial-keyword aware, and
cannot efficiently support the processing of rapidly arriving spatial-keyword
data streams. This paper presents Tornado, a distributed spatial-keyword stream
processing system. Tornado features routing units to fairly distribute the
workload, and furthermore, co-locate the data objects and the corresponding
queries at the same processing units. The routing units use the Augmented-Grid,
a novel structure that is equipped with an efficient search algorithm for
distributing the data objects and queries. Tornado uses evaluators to process
the data objects against the queries. The routing units minimize the redundant
communication by not sending data updates for processing when these updates do
not match any query. By applying dynamically evaluated cost formulae that
continuously represent the processing overhead at each evaluator, Tornado is
adaptive to changes in the workload. Extensive experimental evaluation using
spatio-textual range queries over real Twitter data indicates that Tornado
outperforms the non-spatio-textually aware approaches by up to two orders of
magnitude in terms of the overall system throughput.

then extended to consider the biological cell in which modes are definitively
sustained without artificial assistance. The properties of resonators and their
emitted energy spectra are studied within the general framework of the Finite
Difference Time Domain method, requiring supercomputing resources to probe the
transient behaviour and interactions among the electromagnetic fields. The
formal theory of Mie scattering is also extended to develop a cutting-edge,
computationally efficient model for general, multilayer microspheres, which
represents a valuable achievement for the scientific community in its own
right. The model unifies the approaches in the field of mathematical modelling
to express the energy spectrum in a single encompassing equation, which is then
applied in a range of contexts. The gulf between modelling and biological
resonators is bridged by an in-depth study of the physical characteristics of a
range of biological cells, and the selection criteria for viable resonator
candidates are developed through a number of detailed feasibility studies. The
bovine embryo is consequently selected as the optimal choice for this
investigation. Evidence is established for the ability of a bovine embryo to
sustain whispering gallery modes. The ability of a cell to sustain modes on its
own represents a conceptually elegant paradigm for new technologies involving
on-site cell interrogation and reporting of the status and health of a

inference technique that is increasingly popular due to its fast runtimes on
large-scale datasets. However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means
for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances.
Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By
deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations
on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and
local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical
usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior
covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature
relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and
include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that
the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior
means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.

applications to various gravitational systems. In the Unruh state for the
evaporating black holes, the free-fall energy density is found to be negative
divergent at the horizon, which is in contrast to the conventional calculations
performed in the Kruskal coordinates. We resolve this conflict by invoking that
the Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon.
In the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, despite the negative finite proper energy
density at the horizon, the Tolman temperature is divergent there due to the
infinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent
Stefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman
temperature is eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is
surprisingly restored at the horizon. Then, we also show that the firewall
necessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman temperature in
the evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely
blueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing
Hawking radiation characterized by the effective Tolman temperature indeed
originates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at the horizon. So, the
firewall and the atmosphere for the Hawking radiation turn out to be
compatible, once we discard the fact that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh
state originates from the infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at the
horizon. Finally, as a cosmological application, the initial radiation energy
density in warm inflation scenarios has been assumed to be finite when
inflation starts. We successfully find the origin of the non-vanishing initial
radiation energy density in the warm inflation by using the effective Tolman
temperature.

learning. Most existing works consider this problem from the view of the depth
of a network. In this paper, we study how width affects the expressiveness of
neural networks. Classical results state that depth-bounded (e.g. depth-$2$)
networks with suitable activation functions are universal approximators. We
show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks:
width-$(n+4)$ ReLU networks, where $n$ is the input dimension, are universal
approximators. Moreover, except for a measure zero set, all functions cannot be
approximated by width-$n$ ReLU networks, which exhibits a phase transition.
Several recent works demonstrate the benefits of depth by proving the
depth-efficiency of neural networks. That is, there are classes of deep
networks which cannot be realized by any shallow network whose size is no more
than an exponential bound. Here we pose the dual question on the
width-efficiency of ReLU networks: Are there wide networks that cannot be
realized by narrow networks whose size is not substantially larger? We show
that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any
narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other
hand, we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size
exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and
shallow network with high accuracy. Our results provide more comprehensive
evidence that depth is more effective than width for the expressiveness of ReLU
networks.

quality. Moreover, we find that engagement measures of a video are stable over
time, thus separating the concerns for modeling engagement and those for
popularity -- the latter is known to be unstable over time and driven by
external promotions. We also find engagement metrics predictable from a
cold-start setup, having most of its variance explained by video context,

of summary statistics. Since the matter density field becomes highly
non-Gaussian as structure evolves under gravity, we expect other statistical
descriptions of the field to provide us with additional information. One way to
study the non-Gaussianity is to study filaments, which evolve non-linearly from
the initial density fluctuations produced in the primordial Universe. In our

dimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their
area--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes
with a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed.
Preliminary analysis of changes in lake size over time in paired lakes (lakes
that were visually matched in both the historical map and the satellite
imagery) indicate that some lakes in our study region have increased in size
over time, whereas others have decreased in size over time. Lake size change
during this 39-year time interval can be up to half the size of the lake as
recorded in the historical map.

successor to traditional imaging methods for breast cancer detection in order
to decrease the computational complexity. In this framework, the breast is
devided into seg- ments in an iterative process and in each iteration, the one
having the most probability of containing tumor with lowest possible resolution
is selected by using suitable decision metrics. After finding the smallest
tumor-containing segment, the resolution is increased in the detected
tumor-containing segment, leaving the other parts of the breast image with low
resolution. Our framework is applied on the most common used beamforming
techniques, such as delay and sum (DAS) and delay multiply and sum (DMAS) and
according to simulation results, our framework can decrease the computational
complexity significantly for both DAS and DMAS without imposing any degradation
on accuracy of basic algorithms. The amount of complexity reduction can be
determined manually or automatically based on two proposed methods that are
described in this framework.

n-Kronecker quiver K(n) (the quiver with two vertices, namely a sink and a
source, and n arrows) over some fixed field. The universal cover of K(n) is the
n-regular tree with bipartite orientation.
  The paper deals with the representations of the n-regular tree with bipartite
orientation (thus with graded Kronecker modules). The simultaneous
Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection at all sinks will be called the shift
functor, and we consider the orbits under this shift functor. Whereas the
length of a regular module growths exponentially when we apply the shift
functor repeatedly, the radius of such a module growths just linearly.
  To any regular shift orbit, we attach a positive integer r (the minimal
radius of the sink modules in the orbit) and the path in T(n) which starts at
the center p of the sink modules in the orbit and ends at the center q of the
source modules in the orbit. If r is even, then p has to be a sink, otherwise a
source. We call this path the center path of the orbit (since the center of any
module in the orbit lies on this path). If the center path of a shift orbit has
length b, then the orbit contains precisely b flow modules, the remaining
modules are sink modules and source modules. We use this division in order to
index the regular graded Kronecker modules in a coherent way. Conversely, we
show that given a positive integer r and a path in T(n) (starting at a sink iff
r is even), there are regular shift orbits with these invariants.

not only realistic in the near future but can also bring significant benefits.
In particular, it can potentially solve several problems relating to vehicles
and traffic, for instance: (i) possible reduction of traffic congestion, with
the consequence of improved fuel economy and reduced driver inactivity; (ii)
possible reduction in the number of accidents, assuming that an AV can minimise
the human errors that often cause traffic accidents; and (iii) increased ease
of parking, especially when one considers the potential for shared AVs. In
order to deploy an AV there are significant steps that must be completed in
terms of hardware and software. As expected, software components play a key
role in the complex AV system and so, at least for safety, we should assess the
correctness of these components.
  In this paper, we are concerned with the high-level software component(s)
responsible for the decisions in an AV. We intend to model an AV capable of
navigation; obstacle avoidance; obstacle selection (when a crash is
unavoidable) and vehicle recovery, etc, using a rational agent. To achieve
this, we have established the following stages. First, the agent plans and
actions have been implemented within the Gwendolen agent programming language.
Second, we have built a simulated automotive environment in the Java language.
Third, we have formally specified some of the required agent properties through
LTL formulae, which are then formally verified with the AJPF verification tool.
Finally, within the MCAPL framework (which comprises all the tools used in
previous stages) we have obtained formal verification of our AV agent in terms
of its specific behaviours. For example, the agent plans responsible for
selecting an obstacle with low potential damage, instead of a higher damage
obstacle (when possible) can be formally verified within MCAPL. We must
emphasise that the major goal (of our present approach) lies in the formal
verification of agent plans, rather than evaluating real-world applications.
For this reason we utilised a simple matrix representation concerning the
environment used by our agent.

Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine
classifiers through majority voting. The Dice Coefficient for segmentation was

crystalline GST225 the coherent phonon amplitude monotonically increases as the
photon energy increases, indicating that the phonon amplitude is enhanced by
interband optical absorption, which is associated with the imaginary part of
the dielectric function. In amorphous GST225, in contrast, the coherent phonon
amplitude does not depend on the photon energy, remaining almost constant over
the tuning range. A possible contribution from the polarizability associated
with resonant bonding nature of GST225 is discussed.

hedging of complex financial derivatives. These problems are usually of high
dimensionality and discontinuities. The two factors may significantly
deteriorate the performance of the QMC method. This paper develops an
integrated method that overcomes the challenges of the high dimensionality and
discontinuities concurrently. For this purpose, a smoothing method is proposed
to remove the discontinuities for some typical functions arising from financial
engineering. To make the smoothing method applicable for more general
functions, a new path generation method is designed for simulating the paths of
the underlying assets such that the resulting function has the required form.
The new path generation method has an additional power to reduce the effective
dimension of the target function. Our proposed method caters for a large
variety of model specifications, including the Black-Scholes, exponential
normal inverse Gaussian L\'evy, and Heston models. Numerical experiments
dealing with these models show that in the QMC setting the proposed smoothing
method in combination with the new path generation method can lead to a
dramatic variance reduction for pricing exotic options with discontinuous
payoffs and for calculating options' Greeks. The investigation on the effective
dimension and the related characteristics explains the significant enhancement

of base stations (BSs) provides enormous benefits such as a real proximity, low
latency access to computing resources. However, the envisioned integration
creates many new challenges, among which mobility management (MM) is a critical
one. Simply applying existing radio access oriented MM schemes leads to poor
performance mainly due to the co-provisioning of radio access and computing
services of the MEC-enabled BSs. In this paper, we develop a novel user-centric
energy-aware mobility management (EMM) scheme, in order to optimize the delay
due to both radio access and computation, under the long-term energy
consumption constraint of the user. Based on Lyapunov optimization and
multi-armed bandit theories, EMM works in an online fashion without future
system state information, and effectively handles the imperfect system state
information. Theoretical analysis explicitly takes radio handover and
computation migration cost into consideration and proves a bounded deviation on
both the delay performance and energy consumption compared to the oracle
solution with exact and complete future system information. The proposed
algorithm also effectively handles the scenario in which candidate BSs randomly
switch on/off during the offloading process of a task. Simulations show that
the proposed algorithms can achieve close-to-optimal delay performance while
satisfying the user energy consumption constraint.

structure of the growing LaAlO$_3$ layer at the growth temperature (around 800
$^o$C) in oxygen (pressure around $5\times 10^{-5}$ mbar), since analysis
techniques at these conditions are not readily available. We developed a pulsed

study this issue. The setup allows for layer-by-layer growth control and
in-situ measurements of the angle-dependent electron reflection intensity,
which can be used as a fingerprint of the electronic structure of the surface
layers during growth. By using different substrate terminations and growth
conditions we observe two families of reflectivity maps, which we can connect
either to samples with an AlO$_2$-rich surface and a conducting interface; or
to samples with a LaO-rich surface and an insulating interface. Our
observations emphasize that substrate termination and stoichiometry determine
the electronic structure of the growing layer, and thereby the conductance of
the interface.

contact motions, which take advantage of interaction forces between workpieces
to align them, even when contact force may occur from different directions on
different instances of reproduction. To manage the uncertainty in unstructured
conditions, the motions learned with our method can be reproduced with an
impedance controller. Learning from Demonstration is used because the planning
of compliant motions in 3-D is computationally intractable. The proposed method
will learn an individual compliant motion, many of which can be combined to
solve more complex tasks. The method is based on measuring simultaneously the
direction of motion and the forces acting on the end-effector. From these
measurements we construct a set of constraints for motion directions which,
with correct compliance, result in the observed motion. Constraints from
multiple demonstrations are projected into a 2-D angular coordinate system
where their intersection is determined to find a set of feasible desired
directions, of which a single motion direction is chosen. The work is based on
the assumption that movement in directions other than the desired direction is
caused by interaction forces. Using this assumption, we infer the number of
compliant axes and, if required, their directions. Experiments with a KUKA
LWR4+ show that our method can successfully reproduce motions which require
taking advantage of the environment.

on a situation where an agent called Sender only has few opportunities to

persuasion problem but restrict attention to a simpler one that we call
targeting, i.e. inducing a specific belief state. The analysis is developed
within the frame of a n-dimensional Hilbert space model. We find that when the
prior is known, Sender can induce a targeted belief with a probability of at
least 1/n when using two sequential measurements. This figure climbs to 1/2
when both the target and the belief are known pure states. A main insight from
the analysis is that a well-designed strategy of distraction can be used as a

photometrically since April 19, 2016 and many light curves were obtained
before, during and after the outburst. Those light and color curves observed
before the outburst indicate that the system is a special CV. The white dwarf
is not accreting material from the secondary and there are no accretion disks
surrounding the white dwarf. By comparing the light curves obtained from April
19 to September 14, 2016, it was found that magnetic activity of the secondary
is associated with the outburst. We show strong evidence that the $L_1$ region
on the secondary was heavily spotted before and after the outburst and thus
quench the mass transfer, while the outburst is produced by a sudden mass
accretion of the white dwarf. These results suggest that J162117 is a good

the spinodal temperatures where, below and above the thermodynamic transition

that even the gossamer mechanical action of an AFM tip may locally act as a

relativistic Lense-Thirring precession around a spinning black hole and they
potentially offer a way to measure black hole spins and masses. The connection
between relativistic precession and the resulting QPO has been made either in
terms of a simplified model involving a single test particle producing the QPO,
or in terms of a global model where a geometrically thick accretion flow
precesses coherently as a rigid body. In this paper, we analyse similarities
and differences between these two models, sometimes considered as in opposition
to each other. We demonstrate that the former is the limiting case of the
latter when the radial extent of the precessing flow is very small, and that
solid lower limits to the black hole spin can be obtained by considering the
test particle model alone. We also show that the global precession model
naturally accounts for the range of frequencies observed for Type-C QPOs
without the need to invoke a truncation of the inner accretion flow before it
reaches the innermost stable circular orbit. Finally, we show that, in order to
maintain rigid precession, the thick accretion flow should be radially narrow,

illustrate the approach a permanent magnet synchronous machine has been
considered. Our key objective is to provide a robust design of the rotor poles

electromagnetic losses, while taking material uncertainties into account. Input
variations of material parameters are modeled using the polynomial chaos
expansion technique, which is incorporated into the stochastic collocation
method in order to provide a response surface model. Additionally, we can
benefit from the variance-based sensitivity analysis. This allows us to reduce
the dimensionality of the stochastic optimization problems, described by the
random-dependent cost functional. Finally, to validate our approach, we provide
the two-dimensional simulations and analysis, which confirm the usefulness of
the proposed method and yield a novel topology of a permanent magnet

processors to directly write values to persistent storage at speeds that are
significantly faster than previous durable media such as hard drives or SSDs.
Many applications of NVM are constructed on a logging subsystem, which enables
operations to appear to execute atomically and facilitates recovery from
failures. Writes to NVM, however, pass through a processor's memory system,
which can delay and reorder them and can impair the correctness and cost of
logging algorithms.
  Reordering arises because of out-of-order execution in a CPU and the
inter-processor cache coherence protocol. By carefully considering the
properties of these reorderings, this paper develops a logging protocol that
requires only one round trip to non-volatile memory while avoiding expensive

persistent set (hash map) that also requires only a single round trip to
non-volatile memory for insertion, updating, or deletion.

always continuous and a discontinuous part (sub-shock) appears when the
velocity of the shock wave is greater than a critical value. In principle, the
sub-shock may occur when the shock velocity $s$ reaches one of the
characteristic eigenvalues of the hyperbolic system. Nevertheless, Rational
Extended Thermodynamics (ET) for a rarefied monatomic gas predicts the
sub-shock formation only when $s$ exceeds the maximum characteristic velocity
of the system evaluated in the unperturbed state $\lambda^{\max}_0$. This fact
agrees with a general theorem asserting that continuous shock structure cannot
exist for $s >\lambda^{\max}_0 $. In the present paper, first, the shock
structure is numerically analyzed on the basis of ET for a rarefied polyatomic
gas with $14$ independent fields. It is shown that, also in this case, the
shock structure is still continuous when $s$ meets characteristic velocities
except for the maximum one and therefore the sub-shock appears only when $s
>\lambda^{\max}_0 $. This example reinforces the conjecture that, the
differential systems of ET theories have the special characteristics such that
the sub-shock appears only for $s$ greater than the unperturbed maximum
characteristic velocity. However, in the second part of the paper, we construct
a counterexample of this conjecture by using a simple $2 \times 2$ hyperbolic
dissipative system which satisfies all requirements of ET. In contrast to
previous results, we show the clear sub-shock formation with a slower shock
velocity than the maximum unperturbed characteristic velocity.

anomalous dependences in $K_{\rm orb}$ is caused by the interband particle-hole

attracted attention of almost everyone who created, developed or explained
quantum physics to the students. Absence of a solution is the basis for the
statement that the physical laws alone are not enough to describe the reduction
of state of the measured particle.
  In the presented study, it is taken into account that the measurement of all
properties of quantum particles can not be carried out in one physical process
(the no-cloning theorem). For such a measurement several series of incompatible
observations are needed, each series is to be carried out by means of a
separate measuring instrument. Each event of measurement is a separate physical
process; combination of different measurement events is performed by the
Measurer - a subject capable of recognizing or not recognizing different events
as similar depending on the purpose of the measurement, and capable as well of
planning the measurements, of obtaining results and making conclusions.
  Several strategies for measuring the quantum state of photon polarization are
considered; it is shown that modeling of a mixed state by a set of photon pure
states is possible only if for this set in all the measurements the same
measuring devices are used. It is also shown that the reduction of the quantum
state is determined by the parameters of interaction of the measuring device
with the measured particle. This fact removes the restrictions on the
magnitudes of correlations of different observables, known as Bell's
inequalities.

when sufficient strain is applied. Since the deformation in response to applied
strain does not change the generic quantifiers of network architecture - the
number of nodes and the number of bonds between them - this rigidity transition
must have a geometric origin. Naive, degree-of-freedom based mechanical
analyses such as the Maxwell-Calladine count or the pebble game algorithm
overlook such geometric rigidity transitions and offer no means of predicting
or characterizing them. We apply tools that were developed for the topological
analysis of zero modes and states of self-stress on regular lattices to
two-dimensional random spring networks, and demonstrate that the onset of
rigidity, at a finite simple shear strain $\gamma^\star$, coincides with the
appearance of a single state of self stress, accompanied by a single floppy
mode. The process conserves the topologically invariant difference between the
number of zero modes and the number of states of self stress, but imparts a
finite shear modulus to the spring network. Beyond the critical shear, we
confirm previously reported critical scaling of the modulus. In the
sub-critical regime, a singular value decomposition of the network's
compatibility matrix foreshadows the onset of rigidity by way of a continuously

navigation in more realistic situations, where the network structure may vary
in time, remain largely unexplored. Here, we analyze the navigability of real
networks by using greedy routing in hyperbolic space, where the nodes are
subject to a stochastic activation-inactivation dynamics. We find that such
dynamics enhances navigability with respect to the static case. Interestingly,
there exists an optimal intermediate activation value, which ensures the best
trade-off between the increase in the number of successful paths and a limited
growth of their length. Contrary to expectations, the enhanced navigability is
robust even when the most connected nodes inactivate with very high
probability. Finally, our results indicate that some real networks are
ultranavigable and remain highly navigable even if the network structure is
extremely unsteady. These findings have important implications for the design

Assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, we
develop an optimal robust transceiver design scheme that minimizes the total

optimizing transmit beamforming and receive PS ratio per receiver. When the CSI

used to study the combined effect of nonzero mass gap $m$ and chemical

experimentally relevant configuration of a Au sphere interacting with a real
graphene sheet or with graphene-coated dielectric substrates made of different
materials. It is shown that for both a free-standing graphene sheet and for
graphene-coated substrates the magnitude of the Casimir force decreases as $m$
is increased, while it increases as $\mu$ is increased, indicating that these
parameters act in opposite directions. According to our results, the impact of
$m$ and/or $\mu$ on the Casimir force for graphene-coated plates is much
smaller than for a free-standing graphene sheet. Furthermore, computations show
that the Casimir force is much stronger for graphene-coated substrates than for
a free-standing graphene sample, but the thermal correction and its fractional
weight in the total force are smaller in the former case. These results are
applied to a differential setup that was recently proposed to observe the giant
thermal effect in the Casimir force for graphene. We show that this experiment

heterogeneous passive networked systems containing damped and undamped nodes.
Given the graph topology and a set of damped nodes, we ask if output consensus
is achieved for all system parameter values. For given parameter values, an
eigenspace analysis is used to determine output consensus. The extension to
parameter-independent stability is characterized by a coloring problem, named
the richly balanced coloring (RBC) problem. The RBC problem asks if all nodes
of the graph can be colored red, blue and black in such a way that (i) every
damped node is black, (ii) every black node has blue neighbors if and only if
it has red neighbors, and (iii) not all nodes in the graph are black. Such a
colored graph is referred to as a richly balanced colored graph.
Parameter-independent stability is guaranteed if there does not exist a richly
balanced coloring. The RBC problem is shown to cover another well-known graph
coloring scheme known as zero forcing sets. That is, if the damped nodes form a
zero forcing set in the graph, then a richly balanced coloring does not exist
and thus, parameter-independent stability is guaranteed. However, the full
equivalence of zero forcing sets and parameter-independent stability holds only
true for tree graphs. For more general graphs with few fundamental cycles an
algorithm, named chord node coloring, is proposed that significantly
outperforms a brute-force search for solving the NP-complete RBC problem.

weak lensing for a tomographic survey. Ellipticity correlation functions and
angular ellipticity spectra for spiral and elliptical galaxies are derived on
the basis of tidal interactions with the cosmic large-scale structure and
compared to the tomographic weak lensing signal. We find that elliptical
galaxies cause a contribution to the weak-lensing dominated ellipticity
correlation on intermediate angular scales between $\ell\simeq40$ and
$\ell\simeq400$ before that of spiral galaxies dominates on higher multipoles.
The predominant term on intermediate scales is the negative cross-correlation
between intrinsic alignments and weak gravitational lensing (GI-alignment). We
simulate parameter inference from weak gravitational lensing with intrinsic
alignments unaccounted; the bias induced by ignoring intrinsic alignments in a
survey like Euclid is shown to be several times larger than the statistical
error and can lead to faulty conclusions when comparing to other observations.
The biases generally point into different directions in parameter space, such
that in some cases one can observe a partial cancellation effect. Furthermore,
it is shown that the biases increase with the number of tomographic bins used
for the parameter estimation process. We quantify this parameter estimation
bias in units of the statistical error and compute the loss of Bayesian
evidence for a model due to the presence of systematic errors as well as the
Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distance between the true model and
the wrongly inferred one.

In the {\it
extended} phase-space formalism, the critical exponents for any spacetime
metric are identical to the standard ones. Motivated by this fact, we give a
general expression for the Helmholtz free energy near the critical point which
correctly reproduces these exponents. The idea is similar to the Landau model
which gives a phenomenological description of the usual second order phase
transition. Here two main inputs are taken into account for the analysis: (a)
black holes should have van der Waals like isotherms and (b) free energy can be
expressed solely as a function of thermodynamic volume and horizon temperature.
Resulting analysis shows that the form of Helmholtz free energy correctly
encapsulates the features of Landau function. We also discuss the {\it isolated
critical point} accompanied by nonstandard values of critical exponents. The
whole formalism is then extended to other two criticalities, namely $Y-X$ and
$T-S$ (based on the standard; i.e. non-extended phase-space), where $X$ and $Y$
are generalized force and displacement, whereas $T$ and $S$ are horizon
temperature and entropy. We observe that in the former case Gibbs free energy
plays the role of Landau function, whereas in the later case that role is
played by the internal energy (here it is black hole mass). Our analysis shows
that, although the existence of van der Waals phase transition depends on the
explicit form of the black hole metric, the values of the critical exponents
are universal in nature.

important information about the geometry of the scene. Diverging from the
traditional goal of 2D object proposals to provide a high recall (lots of 2D

leverage on depth information per frame and multi-view scene information to
obtain accurate 3D object proposals. Using efficient but robust registration
enables us to combine multiple frames of a scene in near real time and generate
3D bounding boxes for potential 3D regions of interest. Using standard metrics,
such as Precision-Recall curves and F-measure, we show that the proposed
approach is significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art
techniques. Our online approach can be integrated into SLAM based video

face-centered-cubic (fcc) crystal, a body-centered-cubic (bcc) crystal and a
fluid phase coexist. At their intersection, these three phases form a liquid
groove, the triple junction. Using confocal microscopy, we resolve the triple
junction on a single particle level in a model system of charged PMMA colloids
in a nonpolar solvent. The groove is found to be extremely deep and the
incommensurate solid-solid interface to be very broad. Thermal fluctuations
hence appear to dominate the solid-solid interface. This indicates a very low
interfacial energy. The fcc-bcc interfacial energy is quantitatively determined
based on Young's equation and, indeed, it is only about 1.3 times higher than
the fcc-fluid interfacial energy close to the triple point.

coronagraphs (PMC) are usually based on a phase mask or plate located at the

PMC to act as a phase-shifting wavefront sensor for better control of the
achieved star extinction ratio in presence of the coronagraphic mask. We
discuss the two main implementations of the phase-shifting process, either
introducing phase-shifts in a pupil plane and sensing intensity variations in
an image plane, or reciprocally. Conceptual optical designs are described in
both cases. Numerical simulations allow for better understanding of the
performance and limitations of both options, and optimizing their fundamental

a bit more efficient when implemented into an image plane, and is compatible

Specifically, we consider natural inflation model and discuss the fine tuning
required for setting almost homogeneous initial conditions over a region of
order several times the Hubble size which is orders of magnitude larger than
any relevant correlation length for field fluctuations. We then propose to use
the special propagating front solutions of reaction-diffusion equations for
localized field domains of smaller sizes. Due to very small velocities of these
propagating fronts we find that the inflaton field in such a ${\it field
domain}$ changes very slowly, contrary to naive expectation of rapid roll down
to the true vacuum. Continued expansion leads to the energy density in the
Hubble region being dominated by the vacuum energy, thereby beginning the
inflationary phase. Our results show that inflation can occur even with a
single localized field domain of size smaller than the Hubble size. We discuss
possible extensions of our results for different inflationary models, as well
as various limitations of our analysis (e.g. neglecting self gravity of the
localized field domain).

  in Decomposition-based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimisation","22 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quality of solution sets generated by decomposition-based evolutionary
multiobjective optimisation (EMO) algorithms depends heavily on the consistency
between a given problem's Pareto front shape and the specified weights'
distribution. A set of weights distributed uniformly in a simplex often lead to
a set of well-distributed solutions on a Pareto front with a simplex-like
shape, but may fail on other Pareto front shapes. It is an open problem on how
to specify a set of appropriate weights without the information of the
problem's Pareto front beforehand. In this paper, we propose an approach to
adapt the weights during the evolutionary process (called AdaW). AdaW
progressively seeks a suitable distribution of weights for the given problem by
elaborating five parts in the weight adaptation --- weight generation, weight
addition, weight deletion, archive maintenance, and weight update frequency.
Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
AdaW works well for Pareto fronts with very different shapes: 1) the
simplex-like, 2) the inverted simplex-like, 3) the highly nonlinear, 4) the
disconnect, 5) the degenerated, 6) the badly-scaled, and 7) the
high-dimensional.

Recognition (akin to reading the synaptic weight) requires small amplitude bias
applied across the RRAM to minimize conductance change. Learning (akin to
writing or updating the synaptic weight) requires large amplitude bias pulses
to produce a conductance change. The contradictory bias amplitude requirement
to perform reading and writing simultaneously and asynchronously, akin to
biology, is a major challenge. Solutions suggested in the literature rely on
time-division-multiplexing of read and write operations based on clocks, or
approximations ignoring the reading when coincidental with writing. In this
work, we overcome this challenge and present a clock-less approach wherein
reading and writing are performed in different frequency domains. This enables
learning and recognition simultaneously on an SNN. We validate our scheme in
SPICE circuit simulator by translating a two-layered feed-forward Iris
classifying SNN to demonstrate software-equivalent performance. The system
performance is not adversely affected by a voltage dependence of conductance in
realistic RRAMs, despite departing from linearity. Overall, our approach

that our systematic trading strategies are able to make money, not as a result

two kinds of financial crisis indicators with a demonstrable power of

distribution of the eigenvalues of a covariance or correlation matrix to a
distribution of reference representing either a calm or agitated market
reference. Secondly, we have those that merely compute at every date a chosen
spectral property (trace, spectral radius or Frobenius norm) of a covariance or
correlation matrix. Aggregating the signals provided by all the indicators in
order to minimize false positive errors, we then build systematic trading
strategies based on a discrete set of rules governing the investment decisions
of the investor. Finally, we compare our active strategies to a passive
reference as well as to random strategies in order to prove the usefulness of
our approach and the added value provided by the out-of-sample predictive power

strong predictive power, with out-of-sample accuracy of about 92%. Separate
regression models are developed to predict the values of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for
cuprate, iron-based, and ""low-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$"" compounds. These models also
demonstrate good performance, with learned predictors offering potential
insights into the mechanisms behind superconductivity in different families of
materials. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of these models, new
features are incorporated using materials data from the AFLOW Online

X-ray angiography. Diagnosing using these images is usually challenging due to
non-uniform illumination, low contrast, presence of other body tissues,
presence of catheter etc. These challenges make the diagnoses task of
cardiologists tougher and more prone to misdiagnosis. In this paper we propose
a new automated framework for coronary arteries segmentation, catheter
detection and center-line extraction in x-ray angiography images. Our proposed
segmentation method is based on superpixels. In this method at first three
different superpixel scales are exploited and a measure for vesselness
probability of each superpixel is determined. A majority voting is used for
obtaining an initial segmentation map from these three superpixel scales. This
initial segmentation is refined by finding the orthogonal line on each ridge
pixel of vessel region. In this framework we use our catheter detection and
tracking method which detects the catheter by finding its ridge in the first
frame and traces in other frames by fitting a second order polynomial on it.
Also we use the image ridges for extracting the coronary arteries centerlines.
We evaluated our method qualitatively and quantitatively on two different
challenging datasets and compared it with one of the previous well-known
coronary arteries segmentation methods. Our method could detect the catheter
and reduced the false positive rate in addition to achieving better
segmentation results. The evaluation results prove that our method performs
better in a much shorter time.

a thermodynamic process. I evidenced that measurement is responsible for an
uncontroled variation of the system's energy that I called quantum heat, and
also a production of entropy. As a proof of concept, I studied an engine
extracting work from the measurementinduced quantum fluctuations. Then, I
extended this formalism to generalized measurements, which allowed to describe
open quantum systems (i.e. in contact with reservoirs). I defined work, heat
and entropy production for single realizations of thermodynamic protocols, and
retrieved that these quantities obey fluctuation theorems. I applied this
formalism to the canonical situation of quantum optics, i.e. a Qubit coupled to
a laser and a the vacuum. Finally, I studied a promising platform to test
Qubit's thermodynamics: a hybrid optomechanical system. The formalism developed
in this thesis is of interest for the quantum thermodynamics community as it
enables to characterize quantum heat engines and compare their performances to
their classical analogs. Furthermore, as it sets quantum measurement as a
thermodynamic process, it pave the ways to a new kind of thermodynamic
machines, exploiting the specificities of quantum realm in an unprecedented
way.

introduces FreeGuard, a secure memory allocator that prevents or reduces a wide

use-after-frees, as well as double and invalid frees. FreeGuard has similar
performance to the default Linux allocator, with less than 2% overhead on

also addresses multiple implementation issues of existing secure allocators,

from classical hopping to shallow tunneling to deep tunneling as the
temperature decreases, and noticeable quantum effects persist at moderate
temperatures. In contrast, with broad-top barriers quantum effects become
important only at low temperatures and the classical to quantum transition is
sharp, at which classical hopping and deep tunneling both occur. This
coexistence indicates that more than one mechanism contributes to the quantum
reaction rate. The conventional definition of the classical to quantum
crossover temperature is invalid for the broad-tops, and we give a new
definition. Extending this we propose a model to predict the transition

likely to be under similar physical conditions. Several correlation matrices
are produced to search for interesting trends between more than 30 distinct
light-curve and spectral properties that characterize the diversity of SNe~II.
Overall, SNe with higher expansion velocities are brighter, have more rapidly
declining light-curves, shorter plateau durations, and higher $^{56}$Ni masses.
Using a larger sample than previous studies, we argue that `$Pd$' - the plateau
duration from the transition of the initial to `plateau' decline rates to the
end of the `plateau' - is a better indicator of the hydrogen envelope mass than
the traditionally used optically thick phase duration ($OPTd$: explosion epoch
to end of plateau). This argument is supported by the fact that $Pd$ also
correlates with s$_3$, the light-curve decline rate at late times: lower $Pd$
values correlate with larger s$_3$ decline rates. Large s$_3$ decline rates are
likely related to lower envelope masses that enables gamma-ray escape. We also
find a significant anticorrelation between $Pd$ and s$_2$ (the plateau decline
rate), confirming the long standing hypothesis that faster declining SNe~II
(SNe~IIL) are the result of explosions with lower hydrogen envelope masses and
therefore have shorter $Pd$ values.

assignment for component classifiers is a problem which is not yet fully
addressed in online evolving environments. We propose a novel data stream
ensemble classifier, called Geometrically Optimum and Online-Weighted Ensemble
(GOOWE), which assigns optimum weights to the component classifiers using a
sliding window containing the most recent data instances. We map vote scores of
individual classifiers and true class labels into a spatial environment. Based
on the Euclidean distance between vote scores and ideal-points, and using the
linear least squares (LSQ) solution, we present a novel, dynamic, and online
weighting approach. While LSQ is used for batch mode ensemble classifiers, it
is the first time that we adapt and use it for online environments by providing
a spatial modeling of online ensembles. In order to show the robustness of the
proposed algorithm, we use real-world datasets and synthetic data generators
using the MOA libraries. First, we analyze the impact of our weighting system
on prediction accuracy through two scenarios. Second, we compare GOOWE with 8
state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers in a comprehensive experimental
environment. Our experiments show that GOOWE provides improved reactions to
different types of concept drift compared to our baselines. The statistical

radical, OHdis) takes effect in many plasma-based applications due to its high
reactivity. Therefore, the quantification of the OHdis in the plasma-liquid
system is of great importance, and a molecular probe method usually used for
the OHdis detection might be applied. Herein we investigate the validity of
using the molecular probe method to estimate the [OHdis] in the plasma-liquid
system. Dimethyl sulfoxide is used as the molecular probe to estimate the
[OHdis] in an air plasma-liquid system, and the partial OHdis is related to the
formed formaldehyde (HCHO) which is the OHdis-induced derivative. The analysis
indicates that the true concentration of the OHdis should be estimated from the
sum of three terms: the formed HCHO, the existing OH scavengers, and the OHdis
generated H2O2. The results show that the measured [HCHO] needs to be corrected
since the HCHO destruction is not negligible in the plasma-liquid system. We
conclude from the results and the analysis that the molecular probe method
generally underestimates the [OHdis] in the plasma-liquid system. If one wants
to obtain the true concentration of the OHdis in the plasma-liquid system, one
needs to know the destruction behavior of the OHdis-induced derivatives, the
information of the OH scavengers (such as hydrated electron, atomic hydrogen
besides the molecular probe), and also the knowledge of the OHdis generated
H2O2.

achievable rate formulas are for full-duplex radios at the relays and for
decode-and-forward relaying. Deployment is done along the straight line joining
a source node and a sink node at an unknown distance from the source. The
problem is for a deployment agent to walk from the source to the sink,
deploying relays as he walks, given that the distance to the sink is
exponentially distributed with known mean. As a precursor, we apply the
multi-relay channel achievable rate formula to obtain the optimal power
allocation to relays placed along a line, at fixed locations. This permits us
to obtain the optimal placement of a given number of nodes when the distance
between the source and sink is given. Numerical work suggests that, at low
attenuation, the relays are mostly clustered near the source in order to be
able to cooperate, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and
work as repeaters. We also prove that the effect of path-loss can be entirely
mitigated if a large enough number of relays are placed uniformly between the
source and the sink. The structure of the optimal power allocation for a given
placement of the nodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of as-you-go
placement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length, and with
the exponential path-loss model, so as to minimize a cost function that is
additive over hops. The hop cost trades off a capacity limiting term, motivated
from the optimal power allocation solution, against the cost of adding a relay
node. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process,
establish results for the value function, and provide insights into the
placement policy and the performance of the deployed network via numerical

for training and for inference when deployed in the field. A common approach to
implementing DNNs is to recast the most computationally expensive operations as
general matrix multiplication (GEMM). However, as we demonstrate in this paper,
there are a great many different ways to express DNN convolution operations
using GEMM. Although different approaches all perform the same number of
operations, the size of temporary data structures differs significantly.
Convolution of an input matrix with dimensions $C \times H \times W$, requires
$O(K^2CHW)$ additional space using the classical im2col approach. More recently
memory-efficient approaches requiring just $O(KCHW)$ auxiliary space have been
proposed.
  We present two novel GEMM-based algorithms that require just $O(MHW)$ and
$O(KW)$ additional space respectively, where $M$ is the number of channels in
the result of the convolution. These algorithms dramatically reduce the space
overhead of DNN convolution, making it much more suitable for memory-limited
embedded systems. Experimental evaluation shows that our low-memory algorithms
are just as fast as the best patch-building approaches despite requiring just a
fraction of the amount of additional memory. Our low-memory algorithms have
excellent data locality which gives them a further edge over patch-building
algorithms when multiple cores are used. As a result, our low memory algorithms
often outperform the best patch-building algorithms using multiple threads.

$U_{EW}(2)$ subject to the Lie algebra condition $\mathfrak{u}_{EW}(2)\not\cong
\mathfrak{su}_{I}(2)\oplus \mathfrak{u}_{Y}(1)$. Physically, the condition
ensures that all electroweak gauge bosons interact with each other prior to
symmetry breaking. This represents a crucial shift in the identification of
physical gauge bosons: Unlike the Standard Model which posits a change of Lie
algebra basis induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking, here the basis is
unaltered and $A,\,Z^0,\,W^\pm$ represent the physical bosons both before and
after spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our choice of $\mathfrak{u}_{EW}(2)$
requires some modification of the matter field representation of the Standard
Model. For $U_{EW}(2)$, there are two pertinent representations ${\mathbf{2}}$
and its $U(2)$-conjugate ${\mathbf{2^c}}$ related by a global gauge
transformation that squares to minus the identity. The product group structure
calls for strong-electroweak degrees of freedom in the
$(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})$ and the $(\mathbf{3},{\mathbf{2^c}})$ of
$SU_C(3)\times U_{EW}(2)$ that possess integer electric charge just like
leptons. These degrees of freedom play the role of quarks, and they lead to a
modified Lagrangian that nevertheless reproduces transition rates and cross
sections equivalent to the Standard Model. The close resemblance between quark
and lepton electroweak doublets suggests a mechanism for a speculative phase
transition between quarks and leptons that stems from the product structure of
the symmetry group. Our hypothesis is that the strong and electroweak bosons
see each other as a source of decoherence. In effect, lepton representations
get identified with the $SU(3)$-trace-reduced quark representations. This
mechanism allows for possible extensions of the Standard Model that don't
require large inclusive multiplets of matter fields.

increase in angular resolution, as compared to 'conventional' Hough transform
based EBSD, of two orders of magnitude, enabling measurements of relative
misorientations of 1E-4 rads (~ 0.006 {\deg}) and changes in (deviatoric)
lattice strain with a precision of 1E-4. This is achieved through direct
comparison of two or more diffraction patterns using sophisticated
cross-correlation based image analysis routines. Image shifts between zone axes
in the two-correlated diffraction pattern are measured with sub-pixel precision
and this realises the ability to measure changes in interplanar angles and
lattice orientation with a high degree of sensitivity. These shifts are linked
to strains and lattice rotations through simple geometry. In this manuscript,
we outline the basis of the technique and two case studies that highlight its
potential to tackle real materials science challenges, such as deformation
patterning in polycrystalline alloys.
