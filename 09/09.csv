tensor Goldstone modes caused \ by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation
(SLIV). Usually this approach is considered for photons and gravitons
separately. We develop the emergent electrogravity theory consisting of the
ordinary QED and the tensor field gravity model which mimics the linearized
general relativity in Minkowski spacetime. In this theory, Lorentz symmetry
appears incorporated into higher global symmetries of the length-fixing
constraints put on the vector and tensor fields involved, $A_{\mu }^{2}=\pm
M_{A}^{2}$ and $H_{\mu \nu }^{2}=\pm M_{H}^{2}$ ($M_{A}$ and $M_{H}$ are the
proposed symmetry breaking scales). We show that such a SLIV pattern being
related to breaking of global symmetries underlying these constraints induces
the massless Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone modes shared among photon and
graviton. While for a vector field case the symmetry of the constraint
coincides with Lorentz symmetry $SO(1,3)$ of the electrogravity Lagrangian, the
tensor field constraint itself possesses much higher global symmetry $SO(7,3)$,
whose spontaneous violation provides a sufficient number of zero modes
collected in a graviton. Accordingly, while photon may only contain true
Goldstone modes, graviton appears at least partially composed from
pseudo-Goldstone modes rather than from pure Goldstone ones. When expressed in
terms of these modes, the theory looks essentially nonlinear and contains a
variety of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings. However, all SLIV effects
turn out to be strictly cancelled in the lowest order processes that is
considered in some detail. How this emergent electrogravity theory could be
observationally differed from conventional QED and GR theories is also briefly
discussed.

  10.12",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In June 2016, Apple announced that it will deploy differential privacy for
some user data collection in order to ensure privacy of user data, even from
Apple. The details of Apple's approach remained sparse. Although several
patents have since appeared hinting at the algorithms that may be used to
achieve differential privacy, they did not include a precise explanation of the
approach taken to privacy parameter choice. Such choice and the overall
approach to privacy budget use and management are key questions for
understanding the privacy protections provided by any deployment of
differential privacy.
  In this work, through a combination of experiments, static and dynamic code
analysis of macOS Sierra (Version 10.12) implementation, we shed light on the
choices Apple made for privacy budget management. We discover and describe
Apple's set-up for differentially private data processing, including the
overall data pipeline, the parameters used for differentially private
perturbation of each piece of data, and the frequency with which such data is
sent to Apple's servers.
  We find that although Apple's deployment ensures that the (differential)
privacy loss per each datum submitted to its servers is $1$ or $2$, the overall
privacy loss permitted by the system is significantly higher, as high as $16$
per day for the four initially announced applications of Emojis, New words,
Deeplinks and Lookup Hints. Furthermore, Apple renews the privacy budget
available every day, which leads to a possible privacy loss of 16 times the
number of days since user opt-in to differentially private data collection for
those four applications.
  We advocate that in order to claim the full benefits of differentially
private data collection, Apple must give full transparency of its
implementation, enable user choice in areas related to privacy loss, and set
meaningful defaults on the privacy loss permitted.

mixing makes it difficult to measure the cutoff frequency if gravitational
waves are observed from inclined direction or the binary is precessing. In this
letter, we show that the cutoff frequency can be measured even in such

that the systematic error in the measurement of the neutron-star radius can be
reduced to $\lesssim 5\%$ for the case that tidal disruption of the neutron

interpreted as a new edge criterion. Heuristically, it excludes the presence of
thermodynamically gapless excitations living near the edge.

improvement possible thanks to a driving signal in orbit almost 500 times

driving superconductor-insulator transitions in ultrathin films by localizing

crossover at material thicknesses $d \sim \xi$ (coherence length) is well
studied, a similarly consequential magnetic crossover at $d \sim L_c$ (pinning

underexamined. According to collective pinning theory, vortex segments of

Consequently, if $d$ truncates $L_c$, a change from elastic to rigid vortex
dynamics should increase the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S$.
Here, we characterize the dependence of $S$ on sample thickness in Nb and
cuprate films. The results for Nb are consistent with collective pinning
theory, whereas creep in the cuprate is strongly influenced by sparse large

provides energy resolution as good as 25 meV but has already reached its

efficient polarization analysis without loss of energy resolution. The

emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our

their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely
independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been
probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from
each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML,
investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve
the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both
directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital
application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our ""big data"" world.
Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become
instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in
data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments,
quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning,
highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works
exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for
performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first
successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also
broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts.
This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a

the gas core [machacek05a]. In our deeper data, we detect a diffuse, low
surface brightness extension to the previously known tail, and measure the
temperature structure within the tail. We combine the deep Chandra data with
archival XMM-Newton observations to put a strong upper limit on the diffuse
emission of the tail out to a large distance (10$\times$the radius of the
remnant core) from the galaxy center. In our two previous papers
[roediger15a,roediger15b], we presented the results of hydrodynamical
simulations of ram pressure stripping specifically for M89 falling into the
Virgo cluster and investigated the effect of ICM viscosity. In this paper, we
compare our deep data with our specifically tailored simulations and conclude
that the observed morphology of the stripped tail in NGC 4552 is most similar
to the inviscid models. We conclude that, to the extent the transport processes
can be simply modeled as a hydrodynamic viscosity, the ICM viscosity is
negligible. More generally, any micro-scale description of the transport
processes in the high-$\beta$ plasma of the cluster ICM must be consistent with
the efficient mixing observed in the stripped tail on macroscopic scales.

simulations. Nevertheless, by means of a sufficient criterion for secular
instability, equilibrium sequences can be used as a computationally inexpensive
way to estimate the onset of dynamical instability, which, in general, is close
to the secular one. This method works well for uniform rotation and relies on
the location of turning points: stellar models that are stationary points in a
sequence of equilibrium solutions with constant rest mass or angular momentum.
Here, we investigate differentially rotating models (using a large number of
equations of state and different rotation laws) and find that several universal
relations between properly scaled gravitational mass, rest mass and angular
momentum of the turning-point models that are valid for uniform rotation, are
insensitive to the degree of differential rotation, to high accuracy.

describe measurements of quantum behavior in the vibrations of a liquid body.
Specifically, we monitor the fluctuations of an individual acoustic standing
wave in superfluid liquid helium, and find that it displays the characteristic
signatures of zero-point motion and measurement back-action. This opens the
possibility of exploiting the properties of liquids in general (and superfluid
helium in particular) to access qualitatively new regimes of quantum

by using two coupled harmonic oscillators as a quantum probe. We discuss a
physical implementation of the sensing technique with two trapped ions coupled
via Coulomb mediated phonon hopping. Our method relies on using the coupling
between the localized ion oscillations and the internal states of the trapped
ions which allows to measure spatially varying electric and magnetic fields.
First we discuss an adiabatic sensing technique which is capable to detect a
very small force difference simply by measuring the ion spin population. We
also show that the adiabatic method can be used for detection magnetic field
gradient which is independent of the magnetic offset. Second, we show that the
strong spin phonon coupling could leads to improve sensitivity to force as well
as to phase estimations. We quantify the sensitivity in terms of quantum Fisher
information and show that it diverges by approaching the critical coupling.

$^{12}$CO(2-1) and ${\rm H_2O} (2_{11} - 2_{02})$ emission lines, detected

proto-cluster are distributed over a ${\rm 260\, kpc \times 310\, kpc}$ region
and have a collective obscured star-formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 6500 \,
M_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$, considerably higher than has been seen before in any
proto-cluster of galaxies or over-densities of DSFGs at $z \gtrsim 4$. Most of
the star formation is taking place in luminous DSFGs since no Ly$\alpha$
emitters are detected in the proto-cluster core, apart from a Ly$\alpha$ blob
located next to one of the DRC dusty components and extending over $60\,{\rm
kpc}$. The total obscured SFR of the proto-cluster could rise to ${\rm SFR}
\sim 14,400 \, M_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$ if all the members of an over-density
of bright DSFGs discovered around DRC in a wide-field LABOCA 870-$\mu$m image
are part of the same structure. The total halo mass of DRC could be as high as
$\sim 4.4 \times 10^{13}\,M_\odot$ and could be the progenitor of a Coma-like

components suggest either the presence of a mechanism able to trigger extreme
star formation simultaneously in galaxies spread over a few hundred kpc or the
presence of gas flows from the cosmic web able to sustain star formation over
several hundred million years.

generally larger than 80% of the cosmic censorship bound. However, we find that
solutions with three GH centers and one supertube (which are smooth in

construction thus gives a recipe to build large classes of microstate

wavefunction of the universe in a class of toy models of conformally coupled
scalars (with non-conformal interactions) in FRW cosmologies. The contribution
of each Feynman diagram to the wavefunction of the universe is associated with
a certain universal rational integrand, which we identify as the canonical form
of a ""cosmological polytope"", which have an independent, intrinsic definition,

the cosmological polytope descend to symmetries of the wavefunction, (such as
conformal invariance). In cases such as $\phi^3$ theory in $dS_4$, the final

radiation pressure can drive the observed sub-Keplerian rotation. This set of
solutions is further constrained by the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the system, and we find that a dust-to-gas mass ratio of $\sim10^{-3}$ and a
maximum grain size that decreases radially outwards can satisfy both the
rotation curve and SED. These dust populations are dynamically tightly coupled
to the gas azimuthally. However grains larger than $\sim0.5\mu$m are driven
outward radially by radiation pressure at velocities $\sim5$kms$^{-1}$, which
implies a dust replenishment rate of $\sim3\times10^{-9}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$.
This replenishment rate is consistent with observational estimates to within
uncertainties. Coupling between the radial motion of the dust and gas is weak
and hence the gas does not share in this rapid outward motion. Overall we
conclude that radiation pressure is a capable and necessary mechanism to
explain the observed rotation profile of L$_2$ Pup, and offers other additional
constraints on the dust properties.

compact binaries, thus probing the post-Newtonian expansion of general
relativity beyond the weak field regime, while offering unique possibilities of
constraining alternative theories of gravity. Additionally, the correlation of
TOAs from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars can be exploited to detect

reproducibly. However, for learning about the dynamic behaviour of a system, a
live interaction that allows changing parameters on the fly is very helpful.
This is especially interesting for providing interactive demonstrations at
conferences and fairs. In this paper, we present a remote interface to OMNeT++
simulations that can be used to control the simulations while visualising
real-time data merged from multiple OMNeT++ instances. We explain the software
architecture behind our framework and how it can be used to build
demonstrations on the foundation of OMNeT++.

scenarios. Consequently, Java simulation frameworks could be used to firstly
perform functional verification of new approaches (and protocols) in a
simulation environment and afterwards, to evaluate these approaches in real
testbeds using prototype Java implementations. Finally, the simulation models
can be refined using real world measurement data. Unfortunately, there is to
the best of our knowledge no satisfying Java framework for network simulation,
as the OMNeT++ Java support ended with OMNeT++ version 4.6. Hence, our
contributions are as follows: we present Java extensions for OMNeT++ 5.0 that
enable the execution of Java simulation models and give a detailed explanation
of the working principles of the OMNeT++ Java extensions that are based on Java
Native Interface. We conduct several case studies to evaluate the concept of
Java extensions for OMNeT++. Most importantly, we show that the combined use of

as a nearly head-on collision of a small companion with a larger disc galaxy,
to probe the evolution of the gaseous structures and flows, and to explore the
physical conditions setting the star formation activity. Star formation is
first quenched by tides as the companion approaches, before being enhanced
shortly after the collision. The ring ploughs the disc material as it radially
extends, and almost simultaneously depletes its stellar and gaseous reservoir
into the central region, through the spokes, and finally dissolve 200 Myr after
the collision. Most of star formation first occurs in the ring before this
activity is transferred to the spokes and then the nucleus. We thus propose
that the location of star formation traces the dynamical stage of ring
galaxies, and could help constrain their star formation histories. The ring
hosts tidal compression associated with strong turbulence. This compression
yields an azimuthal asymmetry, with maxima reached in the side furthest away
from the nucleus, which matches the star formation activity distribution in our
models and in observed ring systems. The interaction triggers the formation of
star clusters significantly more massive than before the collision, but less
numerous than in more classical galaxy interactions. The peculiar geometry of
Cartwheel-like objects thus yields a star (cluster) formation activity
comparable to other interacting objects, but with notable second order
differences in the nature of turbulence, the enhancement of the star formation
rate, and the number of massive clusters formed.

are used to diminish the effect that anomalous observations or some kinds of
covariates which are not included in the survival models. The frailty models
also deal with this kind of unobserved variability under classical framework
and have been used by practitioners as alternative to Bayesian. We discussed
both approaches of dealing with unobserved heterogeneity with their pros and
cons when a family of rate mixtures of Weibul distributions and a set of random
effect distributions were used under Bayesian and classical approaches
respectively. We investigated how much the classical estimates differ with the
Bayesian estimates, although the paradigm of estimation methods are different.
Two real data examples--a bone marrow transplants data and a kidney infection
data have been used to illustrate the performances of the methods. In both
situations, it is observed that the use of an Inverse-Gaussian mixture
distribution outperforms the other possibilities. It is also noticed that the
estimates of the frailty models are generally somewhat underestimated by
comparing with the estimates of their counterpart.

(Landau--Zener-type) theory of mode conversion, the region of resonant coupling
in low-density plasma is not necessarily narrow, so the coupling matrix cannot
be approximated with its first-order Taylor expansion; also, the initial
conditions are set up differently. For the case of strong magnetic shear, a
simple method is identified for preparing a two-mode wave such that it
transforms into a single-mode wave upon entering high-density plasma. The
theory can be used for reduced modeling of wave-power input in fusion plasmas.
In particular, applications are envisioned in stellarator research, where the
mutual conversion of two electromagnetic modes near the plasma edge is a known

accretion rates varying from $\sim 250L_{Edd}/c^2$ to $1500 L_{Edd}/c^2$. We
form the disks with torus centered at $50-80$ gravitational radii with
self-consistent turbulence initially generated by the magneto-rotational
instability. We study cases with and without net vertical magnetic flux. The
inner regions of all disks have radiation pressure $\sim 10^4-10^6$ times the
gas pressure. Non-axisymmetric density waves that steepen into spiral shocks
form as gas flows towards the black hole. In simulations without net vertical
magnetic flux, Reynolds stress generated by the spiral shocks are the dominant
mechanism to transfer angular momentum. Maxwell stress from MRI turbulence can
be larger than the Reynolds stress only when net vertical magnetic flux is
sufficiently large. Outflows are formed with speed $\sim 0.1-0.4c$. When the
accretion rate is smaller than $\sim 500 L_{Edd}/c^2$, outflows start around
$10$ gravitational radii and the radiative efficiency is $\sim 5\%-7\%$ with
both magnetic field configurations. With accretion rate reaching $1500
L_{Edd}/c^2$, most of the funnel region close to the rotation axis becomes
optically thick and the outflow only develops beyond $50$ gravitational radii.
The radiative efficiency is reduced to $1\%$. We always find the kinetic energy
luminosity associated with the outflow is only $\sim 15\%-30\%$ of the
radiative luminosity. The mass flux lost in the outflow is $\sim 15\%-50\%$ of
the net mass accretion rates. We discuss implications of our simulation results
on the observational properties of these disks.

Yet, the degree to which humans can learn higher-order information about
complex associations is not well understood; nor is it known whether the
learning process differs for social and non-social information. Here, we employ
a paradigm in which the order of stimulus presentation forms temporal
associations between the stimuli, collectively constituting a complex network
structure. We examined individual differences in the ability to learn network
topology for which stimuli were social versus non-social. Although participants
were able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in
social network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social
network learning. Importantly, social traits, including social orientation and
perspective-taking, uniquely predicted the learning of social networks but not
the learning of non-social networks. Taken together, our results suggest that
the process of learning higher-order structure in social networks is
independent from the process of learning higher-order structure in non-social
networks. Our study design provides a promising approach to identify
neurophysiological drivers of social network versus non-social network
learning, extending our knowledge about the impact of individual differences on
these learning processes. Implications for how people learn and adapt to new
social contexts that require integration into a new social network are

using line profile inversions comprises hot plasma loops with a vertical

the dwarf in and out of view causing periodic emission bursts. The magnetic
field is detected at the base of the loops. This is the first time that we can

in determining the physical states of such systems, and malicious adversaries
may intercept these communications in order to infer future states of a CPS or
its components. Accordingly, there arises a need to protect the state values of
a system. Recently, the notion of differential privacy has been used to protect
state trajectories in dynamical systems, and it is this notion of privacy that
we use here to protect the state trajectories of CPSs. We incorporate a cloud
computer to coordinate the agents comprising the CPSs of interest, and the
cloud offers the ability to remotely coordinate many agents, rapidly perform
computations, and broadcast the results, making it a natural fit for systems
with many interacting agents or components. Striving for broad applicability,
we solve infinite-horizon linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) problems, and each
agent protects its own state trajectory by adding noise to its states before
they are sent to the cloud. The cloud then uses these state values to generate
optimal inputs for the agents. As a result, private data is fed into feedback
loops at each iteration, and each noisy term affects every future state of
every agent. In this paper, we show that the differentially private LQR problem
can be related to the well-studied linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem, and
we provide bounds on how agents' privacy requirements affect the cloud's
ability to generate optimal feedback control values for the agents. These
results are illustrated in numerical simulations.

further notoriety following the report of an unusual off-centering of the lead
atoms, accompanied by a local symmetry breaking, on heating. This observation,
which was named emphanisis, ignited considerable controversy regarding the
details of the underlying local structure and the appropriate interpretation of
the total scattering experiments. In this study, we demonstrate close agreement
between our diffuse scattering measurements and our calculations, which allows
us to analyze features such as higher-order correlations that are accessible in
the simulations but not experimentally. This allowed us to discover an unusual
correlated local dipole formation extending over several unit cells with an
associated local reduction of the cubic symmetry in both our x-ray diffuse
scattering measurements and our molecular dynamics simulations. Importantly,
when averaged spatially or temporally, the most probable positions for the ions
are at the centers of their coordination polyhedra. Our results therefore
clarify the nature of the local symmetry breaking, and reveal the source of the
earlier controversy regarding the existence or absence of off-centering.
Finally, we provide an interpretation of the behavior in terms of coupled soft
optical and acoustic modes, which is linked also to the high thermoelectric

groups of agents to converge to inefficient outcomes. We focus on one such
class of environments: Stag Hunt games. Here agents either choose a risky
cooperative policy (which leads to high payoffs if both choose it but low
payoffs to an agent who attempts it alone) or a safe one (which leads to a safe
payoff no matter what). We ask how we can change the learning rule of a single
agent to improve its outcomes in Stag Hunts that include other reactive
learners. We extend existing work on reward-shaping in multi-agent
reinforcement learning and show that that making a single agent prosocial, that
is, making them care about the rewards of their partners can increase the
probability that groups converge to good outcomes. Thus, even if we control a
single agent in a group making that agent prosocial can increase our agent's
long-run payoff. We show experimentally that this result carries over to a
variety of more complex environments with Stag Hunt-like dynamics including
ones where agents must learn from raw input pixels.

observe an interesting transition from the classical fields to the

the formalism to higher orders in the coupling and calculate the contribution
to $G_{22}^{a\mu,b\nu}$ coming from the diagrams representing a single
rescattering between two of the produced gluons. We assume that the two gluons
go on mass shell both before and after the rescattering. The result of our
calculation depends on the ordering between the proper time of the rescattering
$\tau_Z$ and the proper time $\tau$ when the gluon distribution is measured.
For (i) $\tau_Z\gg 1/Q_s$ and $\tau-\tau_Z\gg 1/Q_s$ (with $Q_s$ the saturation
scale) we obtain the same results as from the Boltzmann equation. For (ii)
$\tau-\tau_Z\gg \tau_Z\gg 1/Q_s$ we end up with a result very different from
kinetic theory and consistent with a picture of ""free-streaming"" particles. Due
to the approximations made, our calculation is too coarse to indicate whether
the ordering (i) or (ii) is the correct one: to resolve this controversy, we
shall present a detailed diagrammatic calculation of the rescattering

field $\mathbf{B}^* = \mathbf{B}+(m/e)v_\parallel\nabla \times {\mathbf{b}}$
appears prominently in the equations of motion. Because the parallel component
of this field can vanish, there is a range of parallel velocities where the
Lagrangian guiding center equations of motion are either ill-defined or very
badly behaved. Moreover, the velocity dependence of $\mathbf{B}^*$ greatly
complicates the identification of canonical variables, and therefore the
formulation of symplectic integrators for guiding center dynamics. This Letter
introduces a simple coordinate transformation that alleviates both of these
problems simultaneously. In the new coordinates, the Liouville volume element
is equal to the toroidal cotravariant component of the magnetic field.
Consequently, the large-velocity singularity is completely eliminated.
Moreover, passing from the new coordinate system to canonical coordinates is
extremely simple, even if the magnetic field is devoid of flux surfaces. We
demonstrate the utility of this approach to regularizing the guiding center
Lagrangian by presenting a new and stable one-step variational integrator for
guiding centers moving in arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields.

corrections that lead to deviations from free streaming (and that dominate at
late proper time) would provide evidence for the onset of isotropization (and,
possibly, thermalization) of the produced medium. To find such corrections we
calculate the late-time two-point Green function and the energy-momentum tensor
due to a single $2 \to 2$ scattering process involving two classical fields. To
make the calculation tractable we employ the scalar $\varphi^4$ theory instead
of QCD. We compare our exact diagrammatic results for these quantities to those
in kinetic theory and find disagreement between the two. The disagreement is in
the dependence on the proper time $\tau$ and, for the case of the two-point
function, is also in the dependence on the space-time rapidity $\eta$: the
exact diagrammatic calculation is, in fact, consistent with the free streaming
scenario. Kinetic theory predicts a build-up of longitudinal pressure, which,
however, is not observed in the exact calculation. We conclude that we find no

Until now, evidence for the internal emission mechanism has been lacking;
nearly all tidal disruption flare studies have adopted the external shock model
to explain the observed properties of radio flares. Here we report a result
that presents a challenge to external emission models: we discovered a
cross-correlation between the soft X-ray (0.3-1 keV) and 16 GHz radio flux of
the tidal disruption flare ASASSN-14li. Variability features in the X-ray light
curve appear again in the radio light curve, but after a time lag of about 13
days. This demonstrates that soft X-ray emitting accretion disk regulates the
radio emission. This coupling appears to be inconsistent with all previous
external emission models for this source but is naturally explained if the
radio emission originates from a freely expanding jet. We show that emission
internal to an adiabatically expanding jet can also reproduce the observed
evolution of the radio spectral energy distribution. Furthermore, both the
correlation between X-ray and radio luminosity as well as our radio spectral
modeling imply an approximately linear coupling between the accretion rate and

solar system and can be instrumental in planetary defence and in-situ resource
utilization (ISRU). Asteroids, due to their low gravity are a challenging
target for surface exploration. Current missions envision performing
touch-and-go operations over an asteroid surface. In this work, we analyse the
feasibility of sending scores of nano-landers, each 1 kg in mass and volume of
1U, or 1000 cm3. These landers would hop, roll and fly over the asteroid
surface. The landers would include science instruments such as stereo cameras,
hand-lens imagers and spectrometers to characterize rock composition. A network
of nano-landers situated on the surface of an asteroid can provide unique and
very detailed measurements of a spacecraft impacting onto an asteroid surface.
A full-scale, artificial impact experiment onto an asteroid can help
characterize its composition and geology and help in the development of
asteroid deflection techniques intended for planetary defence. Scores of
nano-landers could provide multiple complementary views of the impact,
resultant seismic activity and trajectory of the ejecta. The nano-landers can
analyse the pristine, unearthed regolith shielded from effects of UV and cosmic
rays and that may be millions of years old. Our approach to formulating this
mission concepts utilizes automated machine learning techniques in the planning
and design of space systems. We use a form of Darwinian selection to select and
identify suitable number of nano-landers, the on-board instruments and control
system to explore and navigate the asteroid environment. Scenarios are
generated in simulation and evaluated against quantifiable mission goals such
as area explored on the asteroid and amount of data recorded from the impact
event.

The global optimization method first reduces a high dimensional search to an
one dimensional geodesic to find a starting point close to a local mode. The
search is accelerated and completed by using a local search method such as
BFGS. We modify the target distribution by extracting a local Gaussian
distribution aound the found mode. The process is repeated to find all the
modes during sampling on the fly. We integrate the optimization algorithm into
the Wormhole Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (WHMC) method. Experimental results show
that, when applied to high dimensional, multimodal Gaussian mixture models and
the network sensor localization problem, the proposed method achieves much
faster convergence, with relative error from the mean improved by about an

determine which samples are neighbors and the similarity between the neighbors
in the original highdimensional space. The projection matrix is then learned on
the assumption that the neighborhood information (e.g., the similarity) is
known and fixed prior to learning. However, it is difficult to precisely
measure the intrinsic similarity of samples in high-dimensional space because
of the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, the neighbors selected according
to such similarity might and the projection matrix obtained according to such
similarity and neighbors are not optimal in the sense of classification and
generalization. To overcome the drawbacks, in this paper we propose to let the
similarity and neighbors be variables and model them in low-dimensional space.
Both the optimal similarity and projection matrix are obtained by minimizing a
unified objective function. Nonnegative and sum-to-one constraints on the
similarity are adopted. Instead of empirically setting the regularization
parameter, we treat it as a variable to be optimized. It is interesting that
the optimal regularization parameter is adaptive to the neighbors in
low-dimensional space and has intuitive meaning. Experimental results on the
YALE B, COIL-100, and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

variable selection and pattern recognition. Ordinarily variable selection
involves seeing how well individual explanatory variables are correlated with
the dependent variable. This practice neglects the possible interactions among
the variables. Simulations have shown that a statistic I, that we used for
variable selection is much better correlated with predictivity than
significance levels. We explain this by defining theoretical predictivity and
show how I is related to predictivity. We calculate the biases of the
overoptimistic training estimate of predictivity and of the pessimistic out of
sample estimate. Corrections for the bias lead to improved estimates of the
potential predictivity using small groups of possibly interacting variables.
These results support the use of I in the variable selection phase of
prediction for data sets such as in GWAS (Genome wide association studies)

circumvent this limitation, we report the first successful fabrication of fully
conformal, 3D full cell TSSBs formed in micromachined silicon substrates with
aspect ratios up to ~10 using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at low processing
temperatures (at or below 250C) to deposit all active battery components. The
cells utilize a prelithiated LiV$_2$O$_5$ cathode, a very thin (40 - 100 nm)
LiPON-like lithium polyphosphazene (Li$_2$PO$_2$N) solid electrolyte, and a
SnN$_x$ conversion anode, along with Ru and TiN current collectors. Planar
all-ALD solid state cells deliver 37 {\mu}Ah/cm$^2${\mu}m normalized to the
cathode thickness with only 0.02% per-cycle capacity loss for hundreds of
cycles. Fabrication of full cells in 3D substrates increases the areal
discharge capacity by up to a factor of 9.3x while simultaneously improving the
rate performance, which corresponds well to trends identified by finite element
simulations of the cathode film. This work shows that the exceptional
conformality of ALD, combined with conventional semiconductor fabrication
methods, provides an avenue for the successful realization of long-sought 3D
TSSBs which provide power performance scaling in regimes inaccessible to planar

$\mathbb B^d$ in $\mathbb C^d$, where $a >0.$ In case all directed trees under

module $\mathscr H_{a}$ associated with the reproducing kernel $\frac{1}{(1 -
\langle{z}, {w}\rangle)^a}$ defined on $\mathbb B^d$. Unlike the case of $d=1$,
the above association does not yield a reproducing kernel Hilbert module if we
relax the assumption that $\mathscr T$ has finite joint branching index. The
main result of this paper classifies all directed Cartesian product $\mathscr
T$ for which the Hilbert modules $\mathscr H_{\mathfrak c_a}(\mathscr T)$ are
isomorphic in case $a$ is a positive integer. One of the essential tools used
to establish this isomorphism is an operator-valued representing measure
arising from $\mathscr H_{\mathfrak c_a}(\mathscr T).$ Further, a careful
analysis of these Hilbert modules allows us to prove that the cardinality of
the $k^{\tiny \mbox{th}}$ generation $(k =0, 1, \ldots)$ of $\mathscr T_1,
\ldots, \mathscr T_d$ are complete invariants for $\mathscr H_{\mathfrak

be attributed to the von Neumann-Wold decomposition for isometries. Along the
way, we identify the joint cokernel $E$ of the multiplication $d$-tuple
$\mathscr M_{z}$ on $\mathscr H_{\mathfrak c_a}(\mathscr T)$ with orthogonal

the prediction ability. In this paper, we use a geometric framework for a
priori determining the ensemble size, which is applicable to most of existing
batch and online ensemble classifiers. There are only a limited number of
studies on the ensemble size examining Majority Voting (MV) and Weighted
Majority Voting (WMV). Almost all of them are designed for batch-mode, hardly
addressing online environments. Big data dimensions and resource limitations,
in terms of time and memory, make determination of ensemble size crucial,
especially for online environments. For the MV aggregation rule, our framework
proves that the more strong components we add to the ensemble, the more
accurate predictions we can achieve. For the WMV aggregation rule, our
framework proves the existence of an ideal number of components, which is equal
to the number of class labels, with the premise that components are completely
independent of each other and strong enough. While giving the exact definition
for a strong and independent classifier in the context of an ensemble is a
challenging task, our proposed geometric framework provides a theoretical
explanation of diversity and its impact on the accuracy of predictions. We
conduct a series of experimental evaluations to show the practical value of our
theorems and existing challenges.

  Learning","in Chinese",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In view of contemporary panoramic camera-laser scanner system, the
traditional calibration method is not suitable for panoramic cameras whose
imaging model is extremely nonlinear. The method based on statistical
optimization has the disadvantage that the requirement of the number of laser
scanner's channels is relatively high. Calibration equipments with extreme
accuracy for panoramic camera-laser scanner system are costly. Facing all these
in the calibration of panoramic camera-laser scanner system, a method based on
supervised learning is proposed. Firstly, corresponding feature points of
panoramic images and point clouds are gained to generate the training dataset
by designing a round calibration object. Furthermore, the traditional
calibration problem is transformed into a multiple nonlinear regression
optimization problem by designing a supervised learning network with
preprocessing of the panoramic imaging model. Back propagation algorithm is
utilized to regress the rotation and translation matrix with high accuracy.
Experimental results show that this method can quickly regress the calibration
parameters and the accuracy is better than the traditional calibration method
and the method based on statistical optimization. The calibration accuracy of
this method is really high, and it is more highly-automated.

of special form. Then a procedure give desired weighted norm inequalities in

obtain main properties of $\Delta _{v}^{r}f$ for functions $f$ given in
$L_{p,\gamma }$, $1\leq p<\infty $, with weights $\gamma $ satisfying the
Muckenhoupt's $A_{p}$ condition. Also we consider some applications of
difference operator $\Delta _{v}^{r}$ in these spaces. In particular, we obtain
that difference $\left\Vert \Delta _{v}^{r}f\right\Vert _{p,\gamma }$ is a
useful tool for computing the smoothness properties of functions these spaces.
It is obtained that $\left\Vert \Delta _{v}^{r}f\right\Vert_{p,\gamma }$ is
equivalent to Peetre's K-functional.

  Alignment and Verification","10 pages, 1 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge distillation is a potential solution for model compression. The
idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher
network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one. Most
previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where
they propose different architects and initializations for the student network.
However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks
such as regression and retrieval are barely considered. To solve the problem,
in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model
distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and
verification. By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the
knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks.
Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the
student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and
verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression
rates. In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a
common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of
classification. Evaluations on the CASIA-Webface and large-scale MS-Celeb-1M
datasets show the effectiveness of this simple trick.

skyrmions (AFM-Sks) promotes a non-vanishing topological spin Hall effect
(TSHE) on the flowing electrons. This results in a substantial enhancement of
the non-adiabatic torque and hence improves the skyrmion mobility. This
non-adiabatic torque increases when decreasing the skyrmion size, and therefore
scaling down results in a much higher torque efficiency. In clean AFM-Sks, we
find a significant boost of the TSHE close to van Hove singularity.
Interestingly, this effect is enhanced away from the band gap in the presence
of non-magnetic interstitial defects. Furthermore, unlike their ferromagnetic
counterpart, TSHE in AFM-Sks increases with increase in disorder strength thus
opening promising avenues for materials engineering of this effect.

subspaces consisting of only similar identities. Combined with the batch OHNM,
hard triplets can be found much easier. Experiments on the large-scale

the projection concepts from Ortner et al. (2017a) and Ortner et al. (2017b).
For each local projection a local discriminant analysis (LDA) model is computed

defined for aggregating the LDA-based posterior probabilities of each subspace

observations.

with site effects. NDSHA effectively accounts for the tensor nature of
earthquake ground motions formally described as the tensor product of the
earthquake source functions and the Green Functions of the pathway. NDSHA uses
all available information about the space distribution of large magnitude
earthquake, including Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) and geological and
geophysical data. It does not rely on scalar empirical ground motion
attenuation models, as these are often both weakly constrained by available
observations and unable to account for the tensor nature of earthquake ground
motion. Standard NDSHA provides robust and safely conservative hazard estimates
for engineering design and mitigation decision strategies without requiring
(often faulty) assumptions about the probabilistic risk analysis model of
earthquake occurrence. If specific applications may benefit from temporal

Italy and Nepal have confirmed the validity of NDSHA approach and application,

  Hilt, Thorsten Strufe","Approximate Stream Analytics in Apache Flink and Apache Spark Streaming",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an
approximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind
approximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the
entire input dataset. Thus, approximate computing - based on the chosen sample
size - can make a systematic trade-off between the output accuracy and
computation efficiency.
  Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art systems for approximate computing
primarily target batch analytics, where the input data remains unchanged during
the course of sampling. Thus, they are not well-suited for stream analytics.
This motivated the design of StreamApprox - a stream analytics system for
approximate computing. To realize this idea, we designed an online stratified
reservoir sampling algorithm to produce approximate output with rigorous error
bounds. Importantly, our proposed algorithm is generic and can be applied to
two prominent types of stream processing systems: (1) batched stream processing
such as Apache Spark Streaming, and (2) pipelined stream processing such as
Apache Flink.
  We evaluated StreamApprox using a set of microbenchmarks and real-world case
studies. Our results show that Spark- and Flink-based StreamApprox systems
achieve a speedup of $1.15\times$-$3\times$ compared to the respective native
Spark Streaming and Flink executions, with varying sampling fraction of $80\%$
to $10\%$. Furthermore, we have also implemented an improved baseline in
addition to the native execution baseline - a Spark-based approximate computing
system leveraging the existing sampling modules in Apache Spark. Compared to
the improved baseline, our results show that StreamApprox achieves a speedup
$1.1\times$-$2.4\times$ while maintaining the same accuracy level.

the governing equation of a semi-linear material under a symmetric
pre-deformation condition maintains the form invariance for longitudinal wave,
so the longitudinal wave control can be made by transformation method without
the constraint condition on principle stretches, but this is not the case for

In this paper, we examine how the growth process of a (social) network is
influenced by past circumstances. In order to tackle this cause, we simply
modify the well known preferential attachment mechanism by imposing a time
dependent kernel function in the network evolution equation. This approach
leads to a fractional order Barabasi-Albert (BA) differential equation,
generalizing the BA model. Our results show that, with passing time, an aging
process is observed for the network dynamics. The aging process leads to a
decay for the node degree values, thereby creating an opposing process to the
preferential attachment mechanism. On one hand, based on the preferential
attachment mechanism, nodes with a high degree are more likely to absorb links;
but, on the other hand, a node's age has a reduced chance for new connections.
This competitive scenario allows an increased chance for younger members to
become a hub. Simulations of such a network growth with aging constraint
confirm the results found from solving the fractional BA equation. We also
report, as an exemplary application, an investigation of the collaboration
network between Hollywood movie actors. It is undubiously shown that a decay in
the dynamics of their collaboration rate is found, - even including a sex
difference. Such findings suggest a widely universal application of the so
generalized BA model.

approach to arbitrary ansatz distributions and Markov processes, demonstrating
that it is a special case of variational moment closure. This provides us with

large couplings. We show that the Weyl asymptotics can be violated in any
spatial dimension $d\geq 1$ -- even if the semi-classical number of bound
states is finite. Furthermore, we prove for all dimensions $d\geq 1$ that, for
potentials well-behaved at infinity and fulfilling suitable decay conditions,
the Weyl asymptotics always hold. These decay conditions are mild in the case
$d\geq 3$, while stronger for $d=1,2$. It is well-known that the semi-classical
number of bound states is -- up to a constant -- always an upper bound on the
size of the discrete spectrum of Schr\""odinger operators if $d\geq 3$. We show
here how to construct general upper bounds on the number of bound states of
Schr\""odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ from semi-classical quantities in
all space dimensions $d\geq 1$ and independently of the positivity-improving
property of the free Hamiltonian.

segmentation. However, few existing algorithms pre-configure any biological
context of their chosen segmentation tissues, and instead rely on the neural
network's optimizer to develop such associations de novo. We present a novel
method for applying deep neural networks to the problem of glioma tissue
segmentation that takes into account the structured nature of gliomas -
edematous tissue surrounding mutually-exclusive regions of enhancing and
non-enhancing tumor. We trained multiple deep neural networks with a 3D U-Net
architecture in a tree structure to create segmentations for edema,
non-enhancing tumor, and enhancing tumor regions. Specifically, training was
configured such that the whole tumor region including edema was predicted
first, and its output segmentation was fed as input into separate models to
predict enhancing and non-enhancing tumor. Our method was trained and evaluated
on the publicly available BraTS dataset, achieving Dice scores of 0.882, 0.732,
and 0.730 for whole tumor, enhancing tumor and tumor core respectively.

distribution problem where the interchange is determined with a symmetric zero
sum game. Simultaneously, the agents update their way of play trying to learn
the optimal one. Here, the agents use mixed strategies. We study this model
using both simulations and theoretical tools. We derive the equations for the
learning mechanism, and we show that the mean strategy of the population
satisfies an equation close to the classical replicator equation.
  Concerning the wealth distribution, there are two interesting situations
depending on the equilibrium of the game. If the equilibrium is a pure
strategy, the wealth distribution is fixed after some transient time, and those
players which are close to optimal strategy are richer. When the game has an
equilibrium in mixed strategies, the stationary wealth distribution is close to
a Gamma distribution with variance depending on the coefficients of the game
matrix. We compute theoretically their second moment in this case.

a small integer and $n$ is the number of locations. The H-matrix technique
allows us to work with general covariance matrices in an efficient way, since
H-matrices can approximate inhomogeneous covariance functions, with a fairly
general mesh that is not necessarily axes-parallel, and neither the covariance
matrix itself nor its inverse have to be sparse. We demonstrate our method with
Monte Carlo simulations and an application to soil moisture data. The C, C++
