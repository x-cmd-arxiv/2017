stations (BSs) have the potential to bring multiplexing and coverage gains by
means of three-dimensional (3D) beamforming. Key technical challenges for their
deployment include the presence of limited-resolution front ends and the
acquisition of channel state information (CSI) at the BSs. This paper
investigates the use of FD-MIMO BSs to provide simultaneously high-rate data
communication and mobile 3D positioning in the downlink. The analysis
concentrates on the problem of beamforming design by accounting for imperfect
CSI acquisition via Time Division Duplex (TDD)-based training and for the
finite resolution of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) at the BSs. Both \textit{unstructured beamforming} and a
low-complexity \textit{Kronecker beamforming} solution are considered, where
for the latter the beamforming vectors are decomposed into separate azimuth and
elevation components. The proposed algorithmic solutions are based on Bussgang
theorem, rank-relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods.
Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can
effectively cater to both data communication and positioning services,
providing only minor performance degradations as compared to the more
conventional cases in which either function is implemented. Moreover, the
proposed low-complexity Kronecker beamforming solutions are seen to guarantee a
limited performance loss in the presence of a large number of BS antennas.

performance of wireless communication systems due to their wide coverage and
high mobility. In this paper, we study a UAV-enabled data collection system,
where a UAV is dispatched to collect a given amount of data from a ground
terminals (GT) at fixed location. Intuitively, if the UAV flies closer to the
GT, the uplink transmission energy of the GT required to send the target data
can be more reduced. However, such UAV movement may consume more propulsion
energy of the UAV, which needs to be properly controlled to save its limited
on-board energy. As a result, the transmission energy reduction of the GT is
generally at the cost of higher propulsion energy consumption of the UAV, which
leads to a new fundamental energy trade-off in Ground-to-UAV (G2U) wireless
communication. To characterize this trade-off, we consider two practical UAV
trajectories, namely circular flight and straight flight. In each case, we
first derive the energy consumption expressions of the UAV and GT, and then
find the optimal GT transmit power and UAV trajectory that achieve different
Pareto optimal trade-off between them. Numerical results are provided to

molecular timing (DBMT) channels. The transmitter simultaneously releases
multiple information particles, where the information is encoded in the time of
release. The receiver decodes the transmitted information based on the random
time of arrival of the information particles, which is modeled as an additive
noise channel. For a DBMT channel without flow, this noise follows the L\'evy
distribution. Under this channel model, the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is
derived and shown to have high computational complexity. It is also shown that
under ML detection, releasing multiple particles improves performance, while
for any additive channel with $\alpha$-stable noise where $\alpha<1$ (such as
the DBMT channel), under linear processing at the receiver, releasing multiple
particles degrades performance relative to releasing a single particle. Hence,
a new low-complexity detector, which is based on the first arrival (FA) among
all the transmitted particles, is proposed. It is shown that for a small number
of released particles, the performance of the FA detector is very close to that
of the ML detector. On the other hand, error exponent analysis shows that the
performance of the two detectors differ when the number of released particles
is large.

predictive uncertainty by adopting a tunable proper scoring rule as the
training criterion and dropout as the implicit Bayesian approximation, which
theoretically proves its correctness.To reduce the computational complexity,
RDeepSense employs efficient dropout and predictive distribution estimation
instead of model ensemble or sampling-based method for inference operations. We
evaluate RDeepSense with four mobile sensing applications using Intel Edison
devices. Results show that RDeepSense can reduce around 90% of the energy
consumption while producing superior uncertainty estimations and preserving at

chains in the $n$-th Tamari lattice $\mathcal{T}_{n}$ range in length from

Young diagrams and identify maximal chains as certain tableaux. For each

$\mathcal{T}_{n}$ of length $n+i$. We give a recursion for
$\#\mathcal{C}_{i}(n)$ and an explicit formula based on predetermined initial

number of maximal chains of length $n$ in $\mathcal{T}_{n}$ is
$\#\mathcal{C}_{0}(n)={n \choose 3}$. The formula has a combinatorial

  In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly fine-tune a Deep Neural

(OT loss) between source and target classifier predictions as a constraint on
the source classifier, the proposed Joint Transfer Learning Network (JTLN) can
effectively learn useful knowledge for target classification from source data.
Furthermore, by using different kind of metric as cost matrix for the OT loss,
JTLN can incorporate different prior knowledge about the relatedness between
target categories and source categories.
  We carried out experiments with JTLN based on Alexnet on image classification
datasets and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed JTLN in
comparison with standard consecutive fine-tuning. This Joint Transfer Learning

superconducting micro-bridge embedded in a high-quality factor superconducting
resonator for a microwave bias and readout with frequency-division multiplexing
in the GHz range. The micro-bridge is kept below its critical temperature and
biased with a microwave current of slightly lower amplitude than the critical
current of the micro-bridge. The response of the detector is the rate of
superconducting fluctuations, which depends exponentially on the concentration
of quasiparticles in the micro-bridge. Excess quasiparticles are generated by
an incident THz signal. Since the quasiparticle lifetime increases
exponentially at lower operation temperature, the noise equivalent power
rapidly decreases. This approach allows for large arrays of noise bolometers
operating above 1 K with sensitivity, limited by 300-K background noise.
Moreover, the response of the bolometer always dominates the noise of the
readout due to relatively large amplitude of the bias current. We performed a
feasibility study on a proof-of-concept device with a ${1.0\times 0.5 \rm \mu

  Control",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Methods for distributed optimization have received significant attention in
recent years owing to their wide applicability in various domains. A
distributed optimization method typically consists of two key components:
communication and computation. More specifically, at every iteration (or every
several iterations) of a distributed algorithm, each node in the network
requires some form of information exchange with its neighboring nodes
(communication) and the computation step related to a (sub)-gradient
(computation). The standard way of judging an algorithm via only the number of
iterations overlooks the complexity associated with each iteration. Moreover,
various applications deploying distributed methods may prefer a different
composition of communication and computation.
  Motivated by this discrepancy, in this work we propose an adaptive cost
framework which adjusts the cost measure depending on the features of various
applications. We present a flexible algorithmic framework, where communication
and computation steps are explicitly decomposed to enable algorithm
customization for various applications. We apply this framework to the
well-known distributed gradient descent (DGD) method, and show that the
resulting customized algorithms, which we call DGD$^t$, NEAR-DGD$^t$ and
NEAR-DGD$^+$, compare favorably to their base algorithms, both theoretically
and empirically. The proposed NEAR-DGD$^+$ algorithm is an exact first-order
method where the communication and computation steps are nested, and when the
number of communication steps is adaptively increased, the method converges to
the optimal solution. We test the performance and illustrate the flexibility of
the methods, as well as practical variants, on quadratic functions and
classification problems that arise in machine learning, in terms of iterations,
gradient evaluations, communications and the proposed cost framework.

variations in the topological properties inherent to those graph structures.
Participants performed a probabilistic motor sequence task in which the order
of button presses was determined by the traversal of graphs with modular,
lattice-like, or random organization. Graph nodes each represented a unique
button press and edges represented a transition between button presses. Results
indicate that learning, indexed here by participants' response times, was
strongly mediated by the graph's meso-scale organization, with modular graphs
being associated with shorter response times than random and lattice graphs.
Moreover, variations in a node's number of connections (degree) and a node's
role in mediating long-distance communication (betweenness centrality) impacted
graph learning, even after accounting for level of practice on that node. These
results demonstrate that the graph architecture underlying temporal sequences
of stimuli fundamentally constrains learning, and moreover that tools from
network science provide a valuable framework for assessing how learners encode
complex, temporally structured information.

identical to that of finding a dense group generated by a universal subset of

Theorem is a well-known theorem that guarantees the existence of a finite
sequence of 1-qubit quantum gates approximating an arbitrary unitary matrix in
$SU(2)$ within specified accuracy $\varepsilon > 0$. In this note we study a
quantitative description of this theorem in the following sense. We will work
with a universal gate set $T$, a subset of $SU(2)$ such that the group
generated by the elements of $T$ is dense in $SU(2)$. For $\varepsilon > 0$
small enough, we define $t_{\varepsilon}$ as the minimum reduced word length
such that every point of $SU(2)$ lies within a ball of radius $\varepsilon$
centered at the points in the dense subgroup generated by $T$. For a measure of
efficiency on T, which we denote $K(T)$, we prove the following theorem: Fix a
$\delta$ in $[0, \frac{2}{3}]$. Choose $f: (0, \infty) \rightarrow (1, \infty)$
satisfying $\lim_{\varepsilon\to
0+}\dfrac{\log(f(t_{\varepsilon}))}{t_{\varepsilon}}$ exists with value $0$.
Assume that the inequality $\varepsilon \leqslant f(t_{\varepsilon})\cdot
5^{\frac{-t_{\varepsilon}}{6-3\delta}}$ holds. Then $K(T) \leqslant 2-\delta$.
Our conjecture implies the following: Let $\nu(5^{t_{\varepsilon}})$ denote the
set of integer solutions of the quadratic form:
$x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2=5^{t_{\varepsilon}}$. Let $M\equiv
M_{S^3}(\mathcal{N})$ denote the covering radius of the points
$\mathcal{N}=\nu(5^{t_{\varepsilon}})\cup\nu(5^{t_{\varepsilon}-1})$ on the
sphere $S^{3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. Then $M \sim f(\log
N)N^{\frac{-1}{6-3\delta}}$. Here $N\equiv

robotics applications. However, direct methods remain brittle in the face of
appearance change due to their underlying assumption of photometric
consistency, which is commonly violated in practice. In this paper, we propose
to mitigate this problem by training deep convolutional encoder-decoder models
to transform images of a scene such that they correspond to a previously-seen
canonical appearance. We validate our method in multiple environments and
illumination conditions using high-fidelity synthetic RGB-D datasets, and
integrate the trained models into a direct visual localization pipeline,
yielding improvements in visual odometry (VO) accuracy through time-varying
illumination conditions, as well as improved metric relocalization performance
under illumination change, where conventional methods normally fail. We further
provide a preliminary investigation of transfer learning from synthetic to real
environments in a localization context. An open-source implementation of our
method using PyTorch is available at https://github.com/utiasSTARS/cat-net.

gradient descent type methods in the proximal setting. First, we introduce the
proportion function, which we further use to analyze all known (and many new)
block-selection rules for block coordinate descent methods under a single
framework. This framework includes randomized methods with uniform, non-uniform
or even adaptive sampling strategies, as well as deterministic methods with
batch, greedy or cyclic selection rules. Second, the theory of strongly-convex
optimization was recently generalized to a specific class of non-convex
functions satisfying the so-called Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. To mirror
this generalization in the weakly convex case, we introduce the Weak
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, using which we give global convergence
guarantees for a class of non-convex functions previously not considered in
theory. Additionally, we establish (necessarily somewhat weaker) convergence
guarantees for an even larger class of non-convex functions satisfying a
certain smoothness assumption only. By combining the two abovementioned
generalizations we recover the state-of-the-art convergence guarantees for a
large class of previously known methods and setups as special cases of our
general framework. Moreover, our frameworks allows for the derivation of new
guarantees for many new combinations of methods and setups, as well as a large
class of novel non-convex objectives. The flexibility of our approach offers a
lot of potential for future research, as a new block selection procedure will
have a convergence guarantee for all objectives considered in our framework,

summary statistics of several selected studies to estimate the outcome of
interest. When considering a continuous outcome, typically each study must
report the same measure of the outcome variable and its spread (e.g., the
sample mean and its standard error). However, some studies may instead report
the median along with various measures of spread. Recently, the task of
incorporating medians in meta-analysis has been achieved by estimating the
sample mean and its standard error from each study that reports a median in
order to meta-analyze the means. In this paper, we propose two alternative
approaches to meta-analyze data that instead rely on medians. We systematically
compare these approaches via simulation study to each other and to methods that
transform the study-specific medians and spread into sample means and their
standard errors. We demonstrate that the proposed median-based approaches
perform better than the transformation-based approaches, especially when
applied to skewed data and data with high inter-study variance. In addition,
when meta-analyzing data that consists of medians, we show that the
median-based approaches perform considerably better than or comparably to the
best-case scenario for a transformation approach: conducting a meta-analysis
using the actual sample mean and standard error of the mean of each study.
Finally, we illustrate these approaches in a meta-analysis of patient delay in

need for better protection of copyright by means of watermarking. Different
methods have been proposed to satisfy the tradeoff between imperceptibility and
robustness as two important characteristics in watermarking while maintaining
proper data-embedding capacity. Many watermarking methods use image independent
set of parameters. Different images possess different potentials for robust and
transparent hosting of watermark data. To overcome this deficiency, in this
paper we have proposed a new hierarchical adaptive watermarking framework. At
the higher level of hierarchy, complexity of an image is ranked in comparison
with complexities of images of a dataset. For a typical dataset of images, the
statistical distribution of block complexities is found. At the lower level of
the hierarchy, for a single cover image that is to be watermarked, complexities
of blocks can be found. Local complexity variation (LCV) among a block and its
neighbors is used to adaptively control the watermark strength factor of each
block. Such local complexity analysis creates an adaptive embedding scheme,
which results in higher transparency by reducing blockiness effects. This two
level hierarchy has enabled our method to take advantage of all image blocks to
elevate the embedding capacity while preserving imperceptibility. For testing
the effectiveness of the proposed framework, contourlet transform (CT) in
conjunction with discrete cosine transform (DCT) is used to embed pseudo-random
binary sequences as watermark. Experimental results show that the proposed
framework elevates the performance the watermarking routine in terms of both
robustness and transparency.

mean-field theory, we study non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) in the
Falicov-Kimball model, with time-periodically driven kinetic energy or
interaction. We systematically investigate the nonequilibrium properties of the
NESS. For a driven kinetic energy, we show that resonant tunneling, where the
interaction is an integer multiple of the driving frequency, plays an important
role in the heating. In the strongly correlated regime, we show that this can
be well understood using Fermi\textquoteright s golden rule and the
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for a time-periodically driven system. We
furthermore demonstrate that resonant tunneling can be used to control the
population of Floquet states to achieve ""photo-doping"". For driven interactions
introduced by an oscillating magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance widely
adopted, we find that the double occupancy is strongly modulated. Our
calculations apply to shaken ultracold atom systems, and to solid state systems

related to lattice modulation spectroscopy. Our calculations are helpful to

environments. The population is of finite size with two competing types, which
are exposed to a fixed number of environmental conditions. Reproductive rate is
determined by both the type and the environment. We first calculate the
condition for selection to favor the mutant relative to the resident wild type.
In large populations, the mutant is favored if and only if the mutant's spatial
average reproductive rate exceeds that of the resident. But environmental
heterogeneity elucidates an interesting asymmetry between the mutant and the
resident. Specifically, mutant heterogeneity suppresses its fixation
probability; if this heterogeneity is strong enough, it can even completely
offset the effects of selection (including in large populations). In contrast,
resident heterogeneity has no effect on a mutant's fixation probability in
large populations and can amplify it in small populations.

averaged galaxy power spectrum and present a new, practical method for
estimating this within an arbitrary survey without the need for running mock
galaxy simulations that cover the full survey volume. The method uses
theoretical arguments to modify the covariance matrix measured from a set of
small-volume cubic galaxy simulations, which are computationally cheap to
produce compared to larger simulations and match the measured small-scale
galaxy clustering more accurately than is possible using theoretical modelling.
We include prescriptions to analytically account for the window function of the
survey, which convolves the measured covariance matrix in a non-trivial way. We
also present a new method to include the effects of supersample covariance and
modes outside the small simulation volume which requires no additional
simulations and still allows us to scale the covariance matrix. As validation,
we compare the covariance matrix estimated using our new method to that from a
brute force calculation using 500 simulations originally created for analysis
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS-MGS). We find
excellent agreement on all scales of interest for large scale structure
analysis, including those dominated by the effects of the survey window, and on
scales where theoretical models of the clustering normally break-down, but the
new method produces a covariance matrix with significantly better
signal-to-noise. Although only formally correct in real-space, we also discuss
how our method can be extended to incorporate the effects of Redshift Space
Distortions.

define the notion of a recursive predicate over graphs using Turing Machine

arithmetical relation over graphs using a total order $\leq_t$ on the set
$\mathcal{G}$ such that ($\mathcal{G},\leq_t$) is isomorphic to

  We introduce the notion of a \textit{capable} structure over graphs, which is
one satisfying the conditions : (1) definability of arithmetic, (2)
definability of cardinality of a graph, and (3) definability of two particular
graph predicates related to vertex labellings of graphs. We then show any
capable structure can define every arithmetical predicate over graphs. As a
corollary, any capable structure also defines every recursive graph relation.
We identify capable structures which are expansions of graph orders, which are
structures of the form ($\mathcal{G},\leq$) where $\leq$ is a partial order. We
show that the subgraph order i.e. ($\mathcal{G},\leq_s$), induced subgraph
order with one constant $P_3$ i.e. ($\mathcal{G},\leq_i,P_3$) and an expansion
of the minor order for counting edges i.e. ($\mathcal{G},\leq_m,sameSize(x,y)$)

several natural graph theoretic predicates in the subgraph order which may be
of independent interest. We discuss the implications of our results and

investigate a novel ranking pipeline to improve the search of datasets used in

the relevance of the query terms, and a dataset categorisation method that
boosts the rank of datasets matching query constraints. The system was
evaluated using a corpus with 800k datasets and 21 annotated user queries. Our
system provides competitive results when compared to the other challenge
participants. In the official run, it achieved the highest infAP among the
participants, being +22.3% higher than the median infAP of the participant's
best submissions. Overall, it is ranked at top 2 if an aggregated metric using
the best official measures per participant is considered. The query expansion
method showed positive impact on the system's performance increasing our
baseline up to +5.0% and +3.4% for the infAP and infNDCG metrics, respectively.
Our similarity measure algorithm seems to be robust, in particular compared to

under different training conditions. Finally, the result categorization did not

dissipation energies in a twofold sense. Firstly, pressure-robustness ensures
the fulfilment of a fundamental invariance principle and velocity error
estimates are not corrupted by the pressure approximability. Secondly,
$Re$-semi-robustness means that constants appearing on the right-hand side of
kinetic and dissipation energy error estimates (including Gronwall constants)
do not explicitly depend on the Reynolds number. Such estimates rely on the
essential regularity assumption $\nabla u \in L^1(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega))$ which
is discussed in detail. In the sense of best practice, we review and establish
pressure- and $Re$-semi-robust estimates for pointwise divergence-free
$H^1$-conforming FEM (like Scott-Vogelius pairs or certain isogeometric based
FEM) and pointwise divergence-free $H$(div)-conforming discontinuous Galerkin
FEM. For convection-dominated problems, the latter naturally includes an upwind
stabilisation for the velocity which is not gradient-based.

two methods, i.e. the Poly_Bi_Decomposition method and the

gate-efficient polymorphic circuits with a higher percentage of polymorphic

resolved ultrafast mid-infrared transient reflection spectroscopy measurements
are performed to study the dynamical anisotropic optical properties of BP under
magnetic fields up to 9 T. The relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carrier is
found to be insensitive to the applied magnetic field due to the broadening of
the Landau levels and large effective mass of carriers. While the anisotropic
optical response of BP decreases with increasing magnetic field, its
enhancement due to the excitation of hot carriers is similar to that without
magnetic field. These experimental results can be well interpreted by the
magneto-optical conductivity of the Landau levels of BP thin film, based on an
effective k*p Hamiltonian and linear response theory. These findings suggest
attractive possibilities of multi-dimensional controls of anisotropic response

short-term memory (LSTM) unit, both of which are types of recurrent neural
network (RNN). Through empirical evidence, both models have been proven to be
effective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks such as natural language
processing (Wen et al., 2015), speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2015), and
text classification (Yang et al., 2016). Conventionally, like most neural
networks, both of the aforementioned RNN variants employ the Softmax function
as its final output layer for its prediction, and the cross-entropy function
for computing its loss. In this paper, we present an amendment to this norm by
introducing linear support vector machine (SVM) as the replacement for Softmax
in the final output layer of a GRU model. Furthermore, the cross-entropy
function shall be replaced with a margin-based function. While there have been
similar studies (Alalshekmubarak & Smith, 2013; Tang, 2013), this proposal is
primarily intended for binary classification on intrusion detection using the
2013 network traffic data from the honeypot systems of Kyoto University.
Results show that the GRU-SVM model performs relatively higher than the
conventional GRU-Softmax model. The proposed model reached a training accuracy
of ~81.54% and a testing accuracy of ~84.15%, while the latter was able to
reach a training accuracy of ~63.07% and a testing accuracy of ~70.75%. In
addition, the juxtaposition of these two final output layers indicate that the
SVM would outperform Softmax in prediction time - a theoretical implication
which was supported by the actual training and testing time in the study.

play a crucial role in astrophysics as standard candles. The chemistry of
classical Cepheids in the Milky Way is now quite well-known. Despite a much
larger sample, the chemical composition of Magellanic Cepheids has been only
scarcely investigated. Aims: For the first time, we study the chemical
composition of several Cepheids located in the same populous cluster: NGC 1866,
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). To also investigate the chemical
composition of Cepheids at lower metallicity, four targets are located in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample allows us to increase the number of
Cepheids with known metallicities in the LMC/SMC by 20%/25% and the number of
Cepheids with detailed chemical composition in the LMC/SMC by 46%/50%. Methods:
We use canonical spectroscopic analysis to determine the chemical composition
of Cepheids and provide abundances for a good number of $\alpha$, iron-peak and
neutron-capture elements. Results: We find that six Cepheids in the LMC cluster
NGC 1866 have a very homogeneous chemical composition, also consistent with red
giant branch (RGB) stars in the cluster. Period--age relations that include no
or average rotation indicate that all the Cepheids in NGC 1866 have a similar
age and therefore belong to the same stellar population. Our results are in
good agreement with theoretical models accounting for luminosity and radial
velocity variations. Using distances based on period-luminosity relations in
the near- or mid-infrared, we investigate for the first time the metallicity
distribution of the young population in the SMC in the depth direction.
Preliminary results show no metallicity gradient along the SMC main body, but
our sample is small and does not contain Cepheids in the inner few degrees of
the SMC.

difference. However, an apparent paradox arises considering the contrary
behaviors of the steady-state coherence and the nonequilibrium measures in
relation to the inter-cavity coupling strength. This paradox is resolved by
decomposing the heat current into a population part and a coherence part. Only
the latter, coherence heat current, is tightly connected to the steady-state
coherence and behaves similarly with respect to the inter-cavity coupling
strength. Interestingly, the coherence heat current flows from the
low-temperature reservoir to the high-temperature reservoir, opposite to the
direction of the population heat current. Our work offers a viable way to
enhance quantum metrology for open quantum systems through steady-state
coherence sustained by the nonequilibrium condition, which can be controlled
and manipulated to maximize its utility. The potential applications go beyond
quantum metrology and extend to areas such as device designing, quantum

additional sources. The full sample comprises most of the radio- and gamma-ray
brightest AGN in the southern quarter of the sky, overlapping with the region

characterize the parsec-scale radio properties of the jets and compare with the

AGN in the TANAMI sky show only a weak positional agreement with high-energy

solution of a system of linear equations. It is particularly attractive because
it allows one to take advantage of sparse matrices and produces (in case of
infinite precision arithmetic) the exact solution after a finite number of
iterations. It is thus well suited for many types of inverse problems. On the
other hand, the method requires the computation of the gradient. Here
difficulty can arise, since the functional of interest to the given inverse
problem may not be differentiable. In this paper, we review two approaches to
deal with this situation: iteratively reweighted least squares and convolution
smoothing. We apply the methods to a more generalized, two parameter penalty
functional. We show advantages of the proposed algorithms using examples from a
geotomographical application and for synthetically constructed multi-scale

specific perception, action and memory tasks, has sparked a long-standing
debate on the nature of temporal organization in cortex. One prominent view is
that this type of synchrony facilitates the binding or grouping of separate
stimulus components. We argue instead for a more general function: A measure of
the prior probability of incoming stimuli, implemented by long-range,
horizontal, intra-cortical connections. We show that networks of this kind --
pulse-coupled excitatory spiking networks in a noisy environment -- can provide
a sufficient substrate for stimulus-dependent spike synchrony. This allows a
quick (few spikes) estimate of the match between inputs and the input history
as encoded in the network structure. Given the ubiquity of small, strongly
excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental
observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that
resemble long-term experience, i.e. patterns of high prior probability.

one of the most important problems to quantitatively discuss the dust growth in
protoplanetary disks. We experimentally investigate the dynamic properties of
dust aggregates by low-speed ($\lesssim 3.2$ m s$^{-1}$) impacts of solid
projectiles. Spherical impactors made of glass, steel, or lead are dropped onto
a dust aggregate of packing fraction $\phi=0.35$ under vacuum conditions. The
impact results in cratering or fragmentation of the dust aggregate, depending
on the impact energy. The crater shape can be approximated by a spherical
segment and no ejecta are observed. To understand the underlying physics of
impacts into dust aggregates, the motion of the solid projectile is acquired by
a high-speed camera. Using the obtained position data of the impactor, we
analyze the drag-force law and dynamic pressure induced by the impact. We find
that there are two characteristic strengths. One is defined by the ratio
between impact energy and crater volume and is $\simeq 120$ kPa. The other
strength indicates the fragmentation threshold of dynamic pressure and is
$\simeq 10$ kPa. The former characterizes the apparent plastic deformation and
is consistent with the drag force responsible for impactor deceleration. The
latter corresponds to the dynamic tensile strength to create cracks. Using
these results, a simple model for the compaction and fragmentation threshold of
dust aggregates is proposed. In addition, the comparison of drag-force laws for
dust aggregates and loose granular matter reveals the similarities and
differences between the two materials.

whose origin is partly ascribed to the possible presence of a large population
of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs), respectively.
However, the number of sources required to generate such an excess is much
larger than what is expected from in situ star formation and evolution, opening
a series of questions about the formation history of the Galactic nucleus. In
this paper we make use of direct $N$-body simulations to investigate whether
these sources could have been brought to the Galactic centre by a population of
star clusters that underwent orbital decay and formed the Galactic nuclear star
cluster (NSC). Our results suggest that the gamma ray emission is compatible
with a population of MSPs that were mass segregated in their parent clusters,
while the X-ray emission is consistent with a population of CVs born via
dynamical interactions in dense star clusters. Combining observations with our
modelling, we explore how the observed $\gamma$ ray flux can be related to
different NSC formation scenarios. Finally, we show that the high-energy
emission coming from the galactic central regions can be used to detect black
holes heavier than $10^5\Ms$ in nearby dwarf galaxies.

dimension the Weiss' energies with frequency $\frac32$ and $2m$, for $m\in

logarithmic type. In particular, at difference from the classical statements,
we do not assume any a priori closeness to a special class of homogeneous
functions. In dimension $2$, we also prove the epiperimetric inequality at any
free boundary point.
  As a first application, we improve the set of admissible frequencies for blow
ups, previously known to be $\lambda \in \{\frac32\} \cup [2,\infty)$, and we
classify the global $\lambda$-homogeneous minimizers, with $\lambda\in
[\frac32,2+c]\cup\bigcup_{m\in \mathbb N}(2m-c_m^-,2m+c_m^+)$, showing as a
consequence that the frequencies $\frac32$ and $2m$ are isolated.

free boundary previously obtained by Athanasopoulos-Caffarelli-Salsa (Amer. J.

improve the $C^1$ regularity of the singular set with frequency $2m$ by an
explicit logarithmic modulus of continuity.

crowd to verify the data credibility of the original sensing crowd, and uses
the verification result to reshape the original sensing dataset into a more
credible posterior belief of the ground truth. Following this approach, we
design a specific cross validation mechanism, which integrates four sampling
techniques with a privacy-aware competency-adaptive push (PACAP) algorithm and
is applicable to time-sensitive and quality-critical MCS applications. It does
not require redesigning a new MCS system but rather functions as a lightweight
""plug-in"", making it easier for practical adoption. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed mechanism substantially improves data credibility in terms of
both reinforcing obscure truths and scavenging hidden truths.

frameworks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Cognitive Semantics belongs to
the movement of Cognitive Linguistics, which is based on contemporary cognitive
science. Each framework could deal with some meaning phenomena, but none of
them fulfills all requirements proposed by applications. A unified semantic
theory characterizing all important language phenomena has both theoretical and
practical significance; however, although many attempts have been made in
recent years, no existing theory has achieved this goal yet.
  This article introduces a new semantic theory that has the potential to
characterize most of the important meaning phenomena of natural language and to
fulfill most of the necessary requirements for philosophical analysis and for
NLP applications. The theory is based on a unified representation of
information, and constructs a kind of mathematical model called cognitive model
to interpret natural language expressions in a compositional manner. It accepts
the empirical assumption of Cognitive Semantics, and overcomes most
shortcomings of Formal Semantics and of Distributional Semantics. The theory,
however, is not a simple combination of existing theories, but an extensive
generalization of classic logic and Formal Semantics. It inherits nearly all
advantages of Formal Semantics, and also provides descriptive contents for
objects and events as fine-gram as possible, descriptive contents which
represent the results of human cognition.
