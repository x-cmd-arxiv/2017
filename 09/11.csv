chemical species, contemporary broadband mid-IR spectroscopic systems are often
hindered by large footprints, moving parts and high power consumption. In this
work, we demonstrate multiheterodyne spectroscopy using interband cascade
lasers, which combines broadband spectral coverage with high spectral
resolution and energy-efficient operation. The lasers generate up to 30 mW of
continuous wave optical power while consuming less than 0.5 W of electrical
power. A computational phase and timing correction algorithm is used to obtain
kHz linewidths of the multiheterodyne beat notes and up to 30 dB improvement in
signal-to-noise ratio. The versatility of the multiheterodyne technique is
demonstrated by performing both rapidly swept absorption and dispersion
spectroscopic assessments of low-pressure ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) acquired by
extracting a single beat note from the multiheterodyne signal, as well as
broadband multiheterodyne spectroscopy of methane (CH$_4$) acquired with all
available beat notes with microsecond temporal resolution and an instantaneous
optical bandwidth of 240 GHz. The technology shows excellent potential for
portable and high-resolution solid state spectroscopic chemical sensors
operating in the mid-infrared.

assessment, using the combination of two separate metrics to measure the
perceptually distinct impact of detail losses and of spurious details. To this
purpose, the gradient of the impaired image is locally decomposed as a
predicted version of the original gradient, plus a gradient residual. It is
assumed that the detail attenuation identifies the detail loss, whereas the
gradient residuals describe the spurious details. It turns out that the
perceptual impact of detail losses is roughly linear with the loss of the
positional Fisher information, while the perceptual impact of the spurious
details is roughly proportional to a logarithmic measure of the signal to
residual ratio. The affine combination of these two metrics forms a new index
strongly correlated with the empirical Differential Mean Opinion Score (DMOS)
for a significant class of image impairments, as verified for three independent
popular databases. The method allowed alignment and merging of DMOS data coming
from these different databases to a common DMOS scale by affine
transformations. Unexpectedly, the DMOS scale setting is possible by the
analysis of a single image affected by additive noise.

(MECs). MECs are small clouds deployed at the network edge to offer cloud
services close to mobile users, and many solutions have been proposed to
maximize service locality by migrating services to follow their users.
Co-location of a user and his service, however, implies that a cyber
eavesdropper observing service migrations between MECs can localize the user up
to one MEC coverage area, which can be fairly small (e.g., a femtocell). We
consider using chaff services to defend against such an eavesdropper, with
focus on strategies to control the chaffs. Assuming the eavesdropper performs
maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we consider both heuristic strategies that
mimic the user's mobility and optimized strategies designed to minimize the
detection or tracking accuracy. We show that a single chaff controlled by the
optimal strategy or its online variation can drive the eavesdropper's tracking
accuracy to zero when the user's mobility is sufficiently random. We further
propose extended strategies that utilize randomization to defend against an
advanced eavesdropper aware of the strategy. The efficacy of our solutions is

obstacles in the surrounding of the vehicle. To achieve that, several sensors
like radars, LiDARs and cameras are installed in autonomous vehicles. The
produced sensor data is fused to a general representation of the surrounding.
In this thesis the dynamic occupancy grid map approach of Nuss et al. is used
while three goals are achieved. First, the approach of Nuss et al. to
distinguish between moving and non-moving obstacles is improved by using Fully
Convolutional Neural Networks to create a class prediction for each grid cell.
For this purpose, the network is initialized with public pre-trained network
models and the training is executed with a semi-automatic generated dataset.
The second goal is to provide orientation information for each detected moving
obstacle. This could improve tracking algorithms, which are based on the
dynamic occupancy grid map. The orientation extraction based on the
Convolutional Neural Network shows a better performance in comparison to an
orientation extraction directly over the velocity information of the dynamic
occupancy grid map. A general problem of developing machine learning approaches
like Neural Networks is the number of labeled data, which can always be
increased. For this reason, the last goal is to evaluate a semi-supervised
learning algorithm, to generate automatically more labeled data. The result of
this evaluation shows that the automated labeled data does not improve the
performance of the Convolutional Neural Network. All in all, the best results
are combined to compare the detection against the approach of Nuss et al. [36]
and a relative improvement of 34.8% is reached.

questions in nuclear astrophysics. The determination of the abundance of these
elements is key to both our understanding of the formation of life on earth and
to the life cycles of stars. While nearly all models of different
nucleosynthesis environments are affected by the production of carbon and
oxygen, a key ingredient, the precise determination of the reaction rate of
12C(a,g)16O, has long remained elusive. This is owed to the reaction's
inaccessibility, both experimentally and theoretically. Nuclear theory has
struggled to calculate this reaction rate because the cross section is produced
through different underlying nuclear mechanisms. Isospin selection rules
suppress the E1 component of the ground state cross section, creating a unique
situation where the E1 and E2 contributions are of nearly equal amplitudes.
Experimentally there have also been great challenges. Measurements have been
pushed to the limits of state of the art techniques, often developed for just
these measurements. The data have been plagued by uncharacterized
uncertainties, often the result of the novel measurement techniques, that have
made the different results challenging to reconcile. However, the situation has
markedly improved in recent years, and the desired level of uncertainty, about
10%, may be in sight. In this review the current understanding of this critical
reaction is summarized. The emphasis is placed primarily on the experimental
work and interpretation of the reaction data, but discussions of the theory and
astrophysics are also pursued. The main goal is to summarize and clarify the
current understanding of the reaction and then point the way forward to an
improved determination of the reaction rate.

an additional term of the stress tensor, but it is added as an external
remodeling force that competes with the passive relaxation dynamics and drags
the system out of equilibrium. In a simple one-dimensional channel geometry, we
show that the interaction between non-uniform nematic order and activity

are closely spaced within several clumps. Under this assumption, we derive a
non-asymptotic lower bound for the minimum singular value of a Vandermonde

noise level increases, the {\it sensitivity of the noise-space correlation

  Counting triangles (i.e., cycles of length three) is a fundamental graph
problem with many applications in social network analysis, web mining, anomaly
detection, etc. Recently, much effort has been made to accurately estimate
global and local triangle counts in streaming settings with limited space.
Although existing methods use sampling techniques without considering temporal
dependencies in edges, we observe temporal locality in real dynamic graphs.
That is, future edges are more likely to form triangles with recent edges than
with older edges.
  In this work, we propose a single-pass streaming algorithm called
Waiting-Room Sampling (WRS) for global and local triangle counting. WRS
exploits the temporal locality by always storing the most recent edges, which
future edges are more likely to form triangles with, in the waiting room, while
it uses reservoir sampling for the remaining edges. Our theoretical and
empirical analyses show that WRS is: (a) Fast and 'any time': runs in linear
time, always maintaining and updating estimates while new edges arrive, (b)
Effective: yields up to 47% smaller estimation error than its best competitors,
and (c) Theoretically sound: gives unbiased estimates with small variances

The example of an indirect measurement of an observable represented by a

The Hamiltonian generating the time evolution of the system in the absence of
direct measurements is assumed to be given by the sum of a term commuting with
$\mathcal{N}$ and a small perturbation not commuting with $\mathcal{N}$. The
system is subject to repeated direct (projective) measurements using a single
instrument whose action on the state of the system commutes with $\mathcal{N}$.
If the Hamiltonian commutes with the observable $\mathcal{N}$ (i.e., if the
perturbation vanishes) the state of the system approaches an eigenstate of
$\mathcal{N}$, as the number of direct measurements tends to $\infty$. If the
perturbation term in the Hamiltonian does \textit{not} commute with
$\mathcal{N}$ the system exhibits ""jumps"" between different eigenstates of

process on the spectrum of $\mathcal{N}$, as the strength of the perturbation

implementation of a novel density of states similarity search tool which is
capable of retrieving materials with similar density of states to a reference

The approach presented here is wide-ranging and can be applied to various

of a material. As the first application, we report about materials exhibiting
electronic structure similarities to the aromatic hydrocarbon p-terphenyl which
was recently discussed as a potential organic high-temperature superconductor
exhibiting a transition temperature in the order of 120~K under strong

we turn to irrational demands and solve the proportional cake cutting problem

precise chemical environment surrounding a particle, which in a concentrated
dispersion is a function of the colloid packing fraction $\eta$. Theoretical
studies have suggested that the effective charge $Z_{\rm{eff}}$ in regulated
systems could, in general, decrease with increasing $\eta$. We test this
hypothesis for nonpolar dispersions by determining $Z_{\rm{eff}}(\eta)$ over a
wide range of packing fractions ($10^{-5} \le \eta \le 0.3$) using a
combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and electrophoretic mobility
measurements. We find a complex dependence of the particle charge as a function
of the packing fraction, with $Z_{\rm{eff}}$ initially decreasing at low
concentrations before finally increasing at high $\eta$. We attribute the
non-monotonic density dependence to a crossover from concentration-independent
screening at low $\eta$, to a high packing fraction regime in which counterions
outnumber salt ions and electrostatic screening becomes $\eta$-dependent. The
efficiency of charge stabilization at high concentrations may explain the

real-world systems, optimizing interactions with the world while simultaneously
learning how the world operates. One general class of algorithms for such
learning is the multi-armed bandit setting. Randomized probability matching,
based upon the Thompson sampling approach introduced in the 1930s, has recently
been shown to perform well and to enjoy provable optimality properties. It
permits generative, interpretable modeling in a Bayesian setting, where prior
knowledge is incorporated, and the computed posteriors naturally capture the
full state of knowledge. In this work, we harness the information contained in
the Bayesian posterior and estimate its sufficient statistics via sampling. In
several application domains, for example in health and medicine, each
interaction with the world can be expensive and invasive, whereas drawing
samples from the model is relatively inexpensive. Exploiting this viewpoint, we
develop a double sampling technique driven by the uncertainty in the learning
process: it favors exploitation when certain about the properties of each arm,
exploring otherwise. The proposed algorithm does not make any distributional
assumption and it is applicable to complex reward distributions, as long as
Bayesian posterior updates are computable. Utilizing the estimated posterior
sufficient statistics, double sampling autonomously balances the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff to make better informed decisions. We
empirically show its reduced cumulative regret when compared to
state-of-the-art alternatives in representative bandit settings.

decide which action to take next so as to maximize rewards. One general class
of algorithms for optimizing interactions with the world, while simultaneously
learning how the world operates, is the multi-armed bandit setting and, in
particular, the contextual bandit case. In this setting, for each executed
action, one observes rewards that are dependent on a given 'context', available
at each interaction with the world. The Thompson sampling algorithm has
recently been shown to enjoy provable optimality properties for this set of
problems, and to perform well in real-world settings. It facilitates generative
and interpretable modeling of the problem at hand. Nevertheless, the design and
complexity of the model limit its application, since one must both sample from
the distributions modeled and calculate their expected rewards. We here show
how these limitations can be overcome using variational inference to
approximate complex models, applying to the reinforcement learning case
advances developed for the inference case in the machine learning community
over the past two decades. We consider contextual multi-armed bandit
applications where the true reward distribution is unknown and complex, which
we approximate with a mixture model whose parameters are inferred via
variational inference. We show how the proposed variational Thompson sampling
approach is accurate in approximating the true distribution, and attains
reduced regrets even with complex reward distributions. The proposed algorithm
is valuable for practical scenarios where restrictive modeling assumptions are
undesirable.

several ways: we allow more general fermion couplings, consider both commuting

potential one can easily obtain essentially arbitrary equations of state,
including violations of the null energy condition, as required for a bounce. As
an example, we construct a model of ekpyrotic contraction followed by a
non-singular bounce into an expanding phase. We analyze cosmological
fluctuations in these models, and show that the perturbations can be rewritten
in real fluid form. We find indications that spinor bounces are stable, and
exhibit several solutions for the perturbations. Interestingly, spinor models
do not admit a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition, and consequently some types
of scalar fluctuations can act as a source for gravitational waves already at
linear order. We also find that the first order dynamics are directionally
dependent, an effect which might lead to distinguished observational

scattering over the last two decades has led us to consider that the proton has
three regions: i) an outer region consisting of a quark-antiquark
($\rm{q}\bar{\rm{q}}$) condensate ground state (also described as
quark-antiquark outer cloud), ii) an inner shell of baryonic charge of size
~0.44 fm, and iii) a core of size ~0.2 fm, where the three valence quarks of a
proton with baryonic charges are confined. The proton structure that has
emerged leads to four main elastic scattering processes in $\rm{pp}$
scattering. The first process, which gives rise to diffraction scattering, is
due to a glancing collision of the outer cloud of one proton with that of
another proton. In a $\bar{\rm{p}}\rm{p}$ glancing collision the corresponding
process occurs. The second process involves multiple \omega-exchanges. The
third process in $\rm{pp}$ scattering is quark-quark scattering via gluon-gluon
interaction. The fourth process - which appears for the first time in our
investigation of $\rm{pp}$ scattering - is a glancing collision at the boundary
of a proton cloud with that of the other proton cloud. To describe
quantitatively the four processes, their parameters have been determined. For
this purpose, we investigated $\rm{pp}$ 7 TeV d\sigma/dt measured by the TOTEM

  Our calculated $\rm{pp}$ elastic d\sigma/dt at 13 TeV has no oscillations in

both disk-bearing and disk-free young stars. We find a significant age spread
of 4-5 Myr among cluster members. Disk-bearing objects are statistically
associated with younger isochronal ages than disk-free sources. The cluster has
a hierarchical structure, with two main blocks. The northern half develops
around the O-type binary star S Mon; the southern half, close to the tip of the
Cone Nebula, contains the most embedded regions of NGC 2264, populated mainly
by objects with disks and ongoing accretion. The median ages of objects at
different locations within the cluster, and the spatial distribution of disked
and non-disked sources, suggest that star formation began in the north of the
cluster, over 5 Myr ago, and was ignited in its southern region a few Myr
later. Star formation is likely still ongoing in the most embedded regions of
the cluster, while the outer regions host a widespread population of more
evolved objects. We find a detectable lag between the typical age of
disk-bearing objects and that of accreting objects in the inner regions of NGC
2264: the first tend to be older than the second, but younger than disk-free
sources at similar locations within the cluster. This supports earlier findings
that the characteristic timescales of disk accretion are shorter than those of
disk dispersal, and smaller than the average age of NGC 2264 (i.e., < 3 Myr).
At the same time, disks in the north of the cluster tend to be shorter-lived
(~2.5 Myr) than elsewhere; this may reflect the impact of massive stars within
the region (notably S Mon), that trigger rapid disk dispersal.

question of when two homomorphisms $\pi_1(\Sigma) \to G$ taking punctures into

We provide an answer to this question in a stable range, meaning that $\Sigma$

The main tool is a classifying space for (framed) $C$-branched $G$-covers, and
related homology classes we call branched Schur invariants, since they take

underlying generating mechanism of a network. Graphon estimation arises in many
applications such as predicting missing links in networks and learning user
preferences in recommender systems. The graphon model deals with a random graph
of $n$ vertices such that each pair of two vertices $i$ and $j$ are connected
independently with probability $\rho \times f(x_i,x_j)$, where $x_i$ is the
unknown $d$-dimensional label of vertex $i$, $f$ is an unknown symmetric
function, and $\rho$ is a scaling parameter characterizing the graph sparsity.
Recent studies have identified the minimax error rate of estimating the graphon
from a single realization of the random graph. However, there exists a wide gap
between the known error rates of computationally efficient estimation
procedures and the minimax optimal error rate.
  Here we analyze a spectral method, namely universal singular value
thresholding (USVT) algorithm, in the relatively sparse regime with the average
vertex degree $n\rho=\Omega(\log n)$. When $f$ belongs to H\""{o}lder or Sobolev
space with smoothness index $\alpha$, we show the error rate of USVT is at most
$(n\rho)^{ -2 \alpha / (2\alpha+d)}$, approaching the minimax optimal error
rate $\log (n\rho)/(n\rho)$ for $d=1$ as $\alpha$ increases. Furthermore, when
$f$ is analytic, we show the error rate of USVT is at most $\log^d
(n\rho)/(n\rho)$. In the special case of stochastic block model with $k$
blocks, the error rate of USVT is at most $k/(n\rho)$, which is larger than the
minimax optimal error rate by at most a multiplicative factor $k/\log k$. This
coincides with the computational gap observed for community detection. A key
step of our analysis is to derive the eigenvalue decaying rate of the edge
probability matrix using piecewise polynomial approximations of the graphon
function $f$.

with phase mixing cancelled on average by anti-phase-mixing (stochastic plasma
echo). This implies that Landau damping is an ineffective route to dissipation
(i.e., to thermalisation of electric energy via velocity space). The full
Fourier-Hermite spectrum is derived. Its asymptotics are $m^{-3/2}$ at low wave
numbers and high Hermite moments ($m$) and $m^{-1/2}k^{-2}$ at low Hermite
moments and high wave numbers ($k$). These conclusions hold at wave numbers
below a certain cut off (analog of Kolmogorov scale), which increases with the
amplitude of the stochastic electric field and scales as inverse square of the
collision rate. The energy distribution and flows in phase space are a simple
and, therefore, useful example of competition between phase mixing and
nonlinear dynamics in kinetic turbulence, reminiscent of more realistic but
more complicated multi-dimensional systems that have not so far been amenable
to complete analytical solution.

mechanisms for multi-item auctions, interesting structural questions have also
been raised and studied. In particular, is it true that the seller can always
extract more revenue from a market where the buyers value the items higher than
another market? In this paper we obtain such a revenue monotonicity result in a
general setting. Precisely, consider the revenue-maximizing combinatorial
auction for $m$ items and $n$ buyers in the Bayesian setting, specified by a
valuation function $v$ and a set $F$ of $nm$ independent item-type
distributions. Let $REV(v, F)$ denote the maximum revenue achievable under $F$
by any incentive compatible mechanism. Intuitively, one would expect that
$REV(v, G)\geq REV(v, F)$ if distribution $G$ stochastically dominates $F$.
Surprisingly, Hart and Reny (2012) showed that this is not always true even for
the simple case when $v$ is additive. A natural question arises: Are these
deviations contained within bounds? To what extent may the monotonicity

phenomenon in a metastable modular metastructure and develop efficient tools

reconfigurable metastable modular chain uncover that when the driving frequency
is within the stopband of the periodic structure, there exists a threshold
input amplitude, beyond which sudden increase in the energy transmission can be
observed. This onset of transmission is caused by nonlinear instability and is
known as supratransmission. Due to spatial asymmetry of strategically
configured constituents, such transmission thresholds could shift considerably
when the structure is excited from different ends and therefore enabling the
non-reciprocal energy transmission. This one-way propagation characteristic can
be adaptable via reconfiguring the metastable modular system. In this new
study, we build upon these findings and advance the state of the art by (a)
exploring the different mechanisms that are able to activate the onset of
supratransmission and their implications on wave energy transmission potential,
and (b) developing an effective design tool - a localized nonlinear-linear
model combined with harmonic balancing and transfer matrix analyses to
analytically and efficiently predict the critical threshold amplitude of the
metastable modular chain. These investigations provide important new

Physics scenario which can be linked to a large Higgs self coupling is the
baryogenesis based on the strong first order phase transition. We revisit the
strong first order phase transition in two classes of Beyond the Standard
Models, namely the Higgs portal with the singlet scalar under the Standard
Model gauge group with Z2 symmetry and the effective field theory approach with
higher-dimensional operators. We numerically investigate a few important issues
in the validity of the effective potential, caused by the breakdown of the
high-temperature approximation, and in the criteria for the strong first order
phase transition. We illustrate that these issues can lead to O(1)
uncertainties in the precision of the Higgs self couplings, which are relevant
when discussing sensitivity limits of different future colliders. We also find
that the quartic coupling of the above two classes of scenarios compatible with
the strong first order electroweak phase transition where the cubic coupling is
not negligible, can achieve a $2\sigma$ sensitivity at the 100 TeV pp-collider.
From this novel observation, we show that the correlation between the Higgs

the presence of elevated hole carrier concentrations. Quantum beat signatures
demonstrate coherent coupling between excitons and trions that have a dephasing

classic RBM. It enjoys a good property of automatically deciding the size of
the hidden layer according to specific training data. With sufficient training,
the iRBM can achieve a competitive performance with that of the classic RBM.
However, the convergence of learning the iRBM is slow, due to the fact that the
iRBM is sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units, the learned filters
change slowly from the left-most hidden unit to right. To break this dependency
between neighboring hidden units and speed up the convergence of training, a
novel training strategy is proposed. The key idea of the proposed training
strategy is randomly regrouping the hidden units before each gradient descent
step. Potentially, a mixing of infinite many iRBMs with different permutations
of the hidden units can be achieved by this learning method, which has a
similar effect of preventing the model from over-fitting as the dropout. The
original iRBM is also modified to be capable of carrying out discriminative
training. To evaluate the impact of our method on convergence speed of learning
and the model's generalization ability, several experiments have been performed
on the binarized MNIST and CalTech101 Silhouettes datasets. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed training strategy can greatly accelerate

profiles measured by IACTs also contain information about the primary particle
type since the cross section of inelastic scattering in the air depends on the
primary mass number. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation

is replaced by a newer version. Hence, it is appealing to assure the new system
still preserves its safety properties. However, instead of inspecting the new
system as a whole, which may result in a large state space, it is beneficial to
reuse the verification results by inspecting the newly added component in
isolation. To this aim, we study the problem of model checking component-based
asynchronously communicating systems in the presence of an unspecified
component against safety properties. Our solution is based on assume-guarantee
reasoning, adopted for asynchronous environments, which generates the weakest
assumption. If the newly added component conforms to the assumption, then the
whole system still satisfies the property. To make the approach efficient and
convergent, we produce an overapproximated interface of the missing component
and by its composition with the rest of the system components, we achieve an
overapproximated specification of the system, from which we remove those traces
of the system that violate the property and generate an assumption for the
missing component.
  We have implemented our approach on two case studies. Furthermore, we
compared our results with the state of the art direct approach. Our resulting
assumptions are smaller in size and achieved faster.

The asymmetric role of this gap respect to the electron-hole exchange, in one

N/F/FS junction and proceed to clarify the role of $d$-wave asymmetry pairing

letter, we study a resistor-ferroelectric capacitor (R-FeC) network through a

Landau theory. We show that transient NC in a R-FeC circuit originates from the
mismatch between rate of free charge change on the metal plate and that of
bound charge change in a ferroelectric (FE) capacitor during polarization
switching. This transient charge dynamic mismatch is driven by the negative
curvature of the FE free energy landscape. It is also analytically shown that a
free energy profile with the negative curvature is the only physical system
that can describe transient NC during the two-state switching in a FE
capacitor. Furthermore, this transient charge dynamic mismatch is justified by
the dependence of external resistance and intrinsic FE viscosity coefficient.
The depolarization effect on FE capacitors also shows the importance of
negative curvature to transient NC. The relation between transient NC and
negative curvature provides a direct insight into the free energy landscape
during the FE switching.

(UAV-BSs) with criterion of minimum UAV-recall-frequency (UAV-RF), indicating
the energy efficiency of mobile UAVs networks. Several different power
consumptions, including signal transmit power, on-board circuit power and the
power for UAVs mobility, and the ground user density are taken into account.
Instead of conventional empirical stochastic models, this paper utilizes a
pattern formation system to track the instable and non-ergodic time-varying
nature of user density. We show that for a single time-slot, the optimal
placement is achieved when the transmit power of UAV-BSs equals their on-board
circuit power. Then, for multiple time-slot duration, we prove that the optimal
placement updating problem is a nonlinear dynamic programming coupled with an
integer linear programming. Since the original problem is NP-hard and can not
be solved with conventional recursive methods, we propose a
sequential-Markov-greedy-decision method to achieve near minimal UAV-RF in
polynomial time. Further, we prove that the increment of UAV-RF caused by
inaccurate predicted user density is proportional to the generalization error
of learned patterns. Here, in regions with large area, high-rise buildings or
low user density, large sample sets are required for effective pattern
formation.

mass to the halo mass, $m_\star \equiv M_\star/M_{\rm dh}$, and the fraction of
the dark halo angular momentum transferred to the stellar disk, $j_\star \equiv
J_\star/J_{\rm dh}$. Since $m_{\star}$ and $j_{\star}$ are determined by many
star-formation related processes, measuring $j_\star$ and $m_\star$ at various
redshifts is essential to understand the formation history of disk galaxies. We
use the 3D-HST GOODS-S, COSMOS, and AEGIS imaging data and photo-$z$ catalog to
examine $j_\star$ and $m_\star$ for star-forming galaxies at $z \sim$ 2, 3, and
4, when disks are actively forming. We find that the $j_\star/m_\star$ ratio is
$\simeq 0.77\pm 0.06$ for all three redshifts over the entire mass range
examined, $8\times 10^{10} < M_{\rm dh}/h^{-1} M_\odot < 2\times 10^{12}$, with
a possible ($<30\%$) decrease with mass. This high ratio is close to those of
local disk galaxies, descendants of our galaxies in terms of $M_{\rm dh}$
growth, implying a nearly constant $j_\star/m_\star$ over past 12 Gyr. These
results are remarkable because mechanisms controlling angular momentum transfer
to disks such as inflows and feedbacks depend on both cosmic time and halo mass
and indeed theoretical studies tend to predict $j_\star/m_\star$ changing with
redshift and mass. It is found that recent theoretical galaxy formation
simulations predict smaller $j_{\star}/m_{\star}$ than our values. We also find
that a significant fraction of our galaxies appears to be unstable against bar
formation.

that heads for {\it perfect} replication of another system, such as a Hubbard
model discussed in high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates. Instead, we use the {\it
similarity} between two systems, and theoretically make up for the difference
between them. That is, (1) we first show that the strong-coupling theory
developed by Nozi\`eres-Schmitt Rink (NSR) can quantitatively explain the
recent EoS experiment on a $^6$Li superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-unitary limit far below the superfluid phase
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. This region is considered to be very
similar to the low density region (crust regime) of a neutron star (where a
nearly unitary $s$-wave neutron superfluid is expected). (2) We then
theoretically compensate the difference that, while the effective range $r_{\rm
eff}$ is negligibly small in a superfluid $^6$Li Fermi gas, it cannot be
ignored ($r_{\rm eff}=2.7$ fm) in a neutron star, by extending the NSR theory
to include effects of $r_{\rm eff}$. The calculated EoS when $r_{\rm eff}=2.7$
fm is shown to agree well with the previous neutron-star EoS in the low density
region predicted in nuclear physics. Our idea indicates that an ultracold
atomic gas may more flexibly be used as a quantum simulator for the study of
other complicated quantum many-body systems, when we use, not only the
experimental high tunability, but also the recent theoretical development in
this field. Since it is difficult to directly observe a neutron-star interior,
our idea would provide a useful approach to the exploration for this mysterious
astronomical object.

The goal of the case study is to perform a global sensitivity analysis and to

errors. These objectives can only be achieved by cheapening the incurred
computational costs, that is, lowering the number of necessary model runs. With
this in mind, a regularity-exploiting metamodeling technique is proposed that
enables fast uncertainty quantification. Principal component analysis is used
for output dimensionality reduction and sparse polynomial chaos expansions are
used for the emulation of the reduced outputs. Sobol' sensitivity indices are
obtained directly from the expansion coefficients by a mere post-processing.
Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior sampling is

that softens the solid at small strains and causes strain hardening at larger

target parameters, the high energy electrons and protons can be illustrated in
experiment at advanced high power laser facilities eg ELI - ALPS. We detailed
the microphysics involved in the acceleration mechanism, which required
investigating the role of plasma density gradients, plasma density, and target
thickness. The role of selfgenerated plasma electric and magnetic fields is
depicted on proton energy and density distribution. We numerically investigate
here the laser driven proton acceleration where energetic protons with energies
more than 200 MeV and charge in excess of 10 nC and conversion efficiency more
than 6 percent (which implies 2.4 J proton beam out of the 40 J incident laser
energy). Additionally and interestingly, we show from simulation study first
time the quasi-monoenergetic ring shaped electron beam driven by circularly
polarised laser which may prove useful for plasma based-based X-ray source and
collimation of positron beam.

momentum $j_\mathrm{b}$ and baryon mass $M_\mathrm{b}$ for a sample of nearby
late-type galaxies with resolved HI kinematics. This work roughly doubles the
number of galaxies with $M_\mathrm{b} \lesssim 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ used to
study the $j_\mathrm{b} - M_\mathrm{b}$ relation. Most of the galaxies in the
sample have their baryon mass dominated by their gas content, thereby offering
$j_\mathrm{b}$ and Mb measures that are relatively unaffected by uncertainties
arising from the stellar mass-to-light ratio. Measured HI surface density
radial profiles together with optical and rotation curve data from the
literature are used to derive a best-fit relation given by
$j_\mathrm{b}=qM_\mathrm{b}^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=0.62\pm 0.02$ and
$\log_{10}q=-3.35\pm 0.25$. This result is consistent with the
$j_\mathrm{b}\propto M_\mathrm{b}^{2/3}$ relation that is theoretically
expected and also measured by Obreschkow & Glazebrook (2014) for their full
sample of THINGS spiral galaxies, yet differs to their steeper relation found
for subsets with fixed bulge fraction. The 30 arcsec spatial resolution of the
HI imaging used in this study is significantly lower than that of the THINGS
imaging used by Obreschkow & Glazebrook (2014), yet the results presented in
this work are clearly shown to contain no significant systematic errors due to
the low-resolution imaging.

when several flow simulations are typically carried out by the engineers to
assess the dependence of the hull total resistance on the geometrical

the gravity dominated vicinity of the black hole and scattering in structures
all the way out to the parsec-scale torus and polar winds. We demonstrate that,

Seyfert-2s carries as much information about the central AGN components as
spectropolarimetric observations of Seyfert-1s. The spectropolarimetric

  Networks with IQ-imbalances","7 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In OFDM relay networks with IQ imbalances and full-duplex relay station (RS),
how to optimize pilot pattern and power allocation using the criterion of
minimizing the sum of mean square errors (Sum-MSE) for the frequency-domain
least-squares channel estimator has a heavy impact on self-interference
cancellation. Firstly, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a
convex optimization. From the KKT conditions, the optimal analytical expression
is derived given the fixed source power and RS power. Subsequently, an optimal
power allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed and presented to further alleviate
the effect of Sum-MSE under the total transmit power sum constraint of source
node and RS. Simulation results show that the proposed OPA performs better than
equal power allocation (EPA) in terms of Sum-MSE, and the Sum-MSE performance
gain grows with deviating $\rho$ from the value of $\rho^o$ minimizing the
Sum-MSE, where $\rho$ is defined as the average ratio of the residual SI
channel at RS to the intended channel from source to RS. For example, the OPA
achieves about 5dB SNR gain over EPA by shrinking or stretching $\rho$ with a
factor $4$. More importantly, as $\rho$ decreases or increases more, the
performance gain becomes more significant.

understand the role of an internal noise on the behavior of the full

of forward contracts. The seller of a futures contract commits to deliver, say,
power, over a certain period, while the classical forward is a financial
agreement settled on a maturity date. Our purpose is to design a
Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework for an additive, mean-reverting, multicommodity
market consisting of forward contracts of any delivery period. The main
assumption is that forward prices can be represented as affine functions of a
universal source of randomness. This allows us to completely characterize the
models which prevent arbitrage opportunities: this boils down to finding a
density between a risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$, such that the prices of
traded assets like forward contracts are true $\mathbb{Q}$-martingales, and the
real world probability measure $\mathbb{P}$, under which forward prices are
mean-reverting. The Girsanov kernel for such a transformation turns out to be
stochastic and unbounded in the diffusion part, while in the jump part the
Girsanov kernel must be deterministic and bounded: thus, in this respect, we
prove two results on the martingale property of stochastic exponentials. The
first allows to validate measure changes made of two components: an
Esscher-type density and a Girsanov transform with stochastic and unbounded
kernel. The second uses a different approach and works for the case of
continuous density. We apply this framework to two models: a generalized
Lucia-Schwartz model and a cross-commodity cointegrated market.

This

tensor through non-linear interactions. We expand the field equations to linear
order in slow rotation and numerically construct solutions in the interior and
exterior of the star with a set of realistic equations of state. We calculate
the physical mass function with respect to observer radius and find that,
unlike in General Relativity, this function does not remain constant outside
the star; rather, it asymptotes to a constant a distance away from the surface,
whose magnitude is controlled by the ratio of gravitational constants. The
Vainshtein-like radius at which the physical and auxiliary mass functions
asymptote to a constant is controlled by the graviton mass scaling parameter,
and outside this radius, bigravity modifications are suppressed. We also
calculate the frame-dragging metric function and find that bigravity
modifications are typically small in the entire range of coupling parameters
explored. We finally calculate both the mass-radius and the moment of
inertia-mass relations for a wide range of coupling parameters and find that
both the graviton mass scaling parameter and the ratio of the gravitational
constants introduce large modifications to both. These results could be used to
place future constraints on bigravity with electromagnetic and

algorithm for large scale data analysis. DL algorithms are computationally
expensive - even distributed DL implementations which use MPI require days of
training (model learning) time on commonly studied datasets. Long running DL
applications become susceptible to faults - requiring development of a fault
tolerant system infrastructure, in addition to fault tolerant DL algorithms.
This raises an important question: What is needed from MPI for de- signing
fault tolerant DL implementations? In this paper, we address this problem for
permanent faults. We motivate the need for a fault tolerant MPI specification
by an in-depth consideration of recent innovations in DL algorithms and their
properties, which drive the need for specific fault tolerance features. We
present an in-depth discussion on the suitability of different parallelism

any critical data structures; and most importantly, consideration for several
fault tolerance proposals (user-level fault mitigation (ULFM), Reinit) in MPI
and their applicability to fault tolerant DL implementations. We leverage a
distributed memory implementation of Caffe, currently available under the

by ex- tending MaTEx-Caffe for using ULFM-based implementation. Our evaluation
using the ImageNet dataset and AlexNet, and GoogLeNet neural network topologies

related to crop health and yield. However, a key challenge is reliable, and
accurate weed detection to minimize damage to surrounding plants. In this
paper, we present an approach for dense semantic weed classification with
multispectral images collected by a micro aerial vehicle (MAV). We use the
recently developed encoder-decoder cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
Segnet, that infers dense semantic classes while allowing any number of input
image channels and class balancing with our sugar beet and weed datasets. To
obtain training datasets, we established an experimental field with varying
herbicide levels resulting in field plots containing only either crop or weed,
enabling us to use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a
distinguishable feature for automatic ground truth generation. We train 6
models with different numbers of input channels and condition (fine-tune) it to
achieve about 0.8 F1-score and 0.78 Area Under the Curve (AUC) classification
metrics. For model deployment, an embedded GPU system (Jetson TX2) is tested
for MAV integration. Dataset used in this paper is released to support the
community and future work.

conservation of energy and azimuthal angular momentum along the orbits of free
test particles in its vicinity, but also to conservation laws for the evolution
of continuum matter fields. However, the Kerr space-time possesses an
additional ""hidden symmetry"" which exhibits itself in an unexpected conserved
quantity along geodesics known as the Carter constant. We investigate the
possibility of using this hidden symmetry to obtain conservation laws and other
identities which could be used to test astrophysical simulations of the

they can detect the violations of evolution equations in a numerical

group together sets of nodes into clusters according to some criterion which
reflects certain structural properties of the network. Beyond the well-known
modularity measures defining communities, there are criteria based on the
existence of similar or identical connection patterns of a node or sets of
nodes to the remainder of the network. A key notion in this context is that of
structurally equivalent or twin nodes, displaying exactly the same connection
pattern to the remainder of the network.
  The first goal of this paper is to extend this idea to subgraphs of arbitrary
order of a given network, by means of the notions of T-twin and F-twin
subgraphs. This is motivated by the need to provide a systematic approach to
the analysis of core-semiperiphery-periphery (CSP) structures, a notion which
somehow lacks a formal treatment in the literature. The goal is to provide an
analytical framework accommodating and extending the idea that the unique
(ideal) core-periphery (CP) structure is a 2-partitioned K2. We provide a
formal definition of CSP structures in terms of core eccentricities and
periphery degrees, with semiperiphery vertices acting as intermediaries. The
T-twin and F-twin notions then make it possible to reduce the large number of
resulting structures by identifying isomorphic substructures which share the
connection pattern to the remainder of the graph, paving the way for the
decomposition and enumeration of CSP structures. We compute the resulting CSP
structures up to order six.
  We illustrate the scope of our results by analyzing a subnetwork of the
network of 1994 metal manufactures trade. Our approach can be further applied
in complex network theory and seems to have many potential extensions.

explain the damping of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) transverse waves in solar

in the Alfv\'en continuum, phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves, and wave leakage.
Our methods make use of Bayesian inference and model comparison techniques. We
first infer the values for the physical parameters that control the wave
damping, under the assumption of a particular mechanism, for typically observed
damping time-scales. Then, the computation of marginal likelihoods and Bayes
factors enable us to quantify the relative plausibility between the alternative
mechanisms. We find that, in general, the evidence is not large enough to
support a single particular damping mechanism as the most plausible one.
Resonant absorption and wave leakage offer the most probable explanations in
strong damping regimes, while phase mixing is the best candidate for
weak/moderate damping. When applied to a selection of 89 observed transverse
loop oscillations, with their corresponding measurements of damping times
scales and taking into account data uncertainties, we find that only in a few
cases positive evidence for a given damping mechanism is available.

delocalized metallic band on top of a superconducting substrate. This system
can describe a chain of magnetic impurities with both localized polarized
orbitals and delocalized s-like orbitals or a conducting wire with embedded
magnetic impurities. We study the interplay between the one-dimensional Shiba
band physics arising from the interplay between magnetic moments and the
substrate and the delocalized wire-like conduction band on top of the
superconductor. We derive an effective low-energy Hamiltonian in terms of two
coupled asymmetric Kitaev-like Hamiltonians and analyze its topological
properties. We have found that this system can host multiple Majorana bound
states at its extremities provided a magnetic mirror symmetry is present. We
compute the phase diagram of the system depending on the magnetic exchange
interactions, the impurity distance and especially the coupling between both
bands. In presence of inhomogeneities which typically break this magnetic
mirror symmetry, we show that the coexistence of a Shiba and wire delocalized
topological band can drive the system into a non-topological regime with a
splitting of Majorana bound states.

handful of clumps on a few 100pc distant from the galactic centre. We show that
such observations can be understood as the result of gravitational

(XY) dynamical decoupling (DD) protocols at room temperature, we study the
sensitivities achieved by utilizing various DD protocols, for measuring
magnetic AC fields at frequencies in the 10-250 kHz range, at room temperature
and 77 K. By performing measurements on an isotopically pure $^{12}$C sample,
we find that the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocol, which is not robust
against pulse imperfections, is less efficient for magnetometry than robust
XY-based sequences. The concatenation of a standard XY-based protocol may
enhance the sensitivities only for measuring high-frequency fields, for which
many ($> 500$) DD pulses are necessary and the robustness against pulse
imperfections is critical. Moreover, we show that cooling is effective only for
measuring low-frequency fields (~10 kHz), for which the experiment time
apporaches $T_1$ at a small number of applied DD pulses.

that act with a large force $f_p$ on the vortices, thereby inducing bistable
configurations that are a characteristic feature of strong pinning theory. We
determine the velocity-dependent average pinning-force density $\langle
F_p(v)\rangle$ and find that it changes on the velocity scale $v_p \sim
f_p/\eta a_0^3$, where $\eta$ is the viscosity of vortex motion and $a_0$ the

much larger than the typical flow velocity $v_c \sim F_c/\eta$ of the free
vortex system at drives near the critical force-density $F_c = \langle
F_p(v=0)\rangle \propto n_p f_p$. As a result, we find a generic excess-force
characteristic, a nearly linear force--velocity characteristic shifted by the
critical force-density $F_c$; the linear flux-flow regime is approached only at
large drives. Our analysis provides a derivation of Coulomb's law of dry

coherent dipolar interactions, such sequences can be used to identify the
dominant interaction type. Moreover, a proper combination of pulsed decoupling

bacteria or biological micromotors, distinguishing them from passive colloids.
A renowned consequence of SP is accumulation at static interfaces, even in the
absence of hydrodynamic interactions. Here we address the role of SP in the
interaction between AP and a moving semipermeable membrane. In particular, we
implement a model of noninteracting AP in a channel crossed by a partially
penetrable wall, moving at a constant velocity $c$. With respect to both the
cases of passive colloids with $c>0$ and AP with $c=0$, the AP with finite $c$
show enhancement of accumulation in front of the obstacle and experience a
largely increased drag force. This effect is understood in terms of an
effective potential localised at the interface between particles and membrane,
of height proportional to $c\tau/\xi$, where $\tau$ is the AP's re-orientation
time and $\xi$ the width characterising the surface's smoothness ($\xi\to 0$
for hard core obstacles). An approximate analytical scheme is able to reproduce
the observed density profiles and the measured drag force, in very good
agreement with numerical simulations. The effects discussed here can be
exploited for automatic selection and filtering of AP with desired parameters.

loss and resilience to disturbances. We simulated pollinator extinctions in
pollination networks by using a hybrid model that combined a recently developed
stochastic coextinction model (SCM) for plant extinctions and a topological
model (TCM) for animal extinctions. Our model accounted for variation in
interaction strengths and included empirical estimates of plant dependence on
pollinators to set seeds. The stochastic nature of such model allowed us
determining plant survival to single (and multiple) extinction events, and
identifying which pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger
secondary extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal
sequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant survival
was more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by interaction
strength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants were the most
sensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in extinction cascades. We
predict that the relationship between dependence and plant connectivity is
crucial to determine network robustness to interaction loss. Finally, we showed
that honeybees and several beetles were keystone species in our communities.
This information is of great value to foresee consequences of pollinator losses
facing current global change and to identify target species for effective
conservation.

that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and does not contribute
to the mass of collapsed objects such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The
abundance of galaxy clusters -- measured through a variety of channels -- has
been extensively used to constrain the normalization of the power spectrum: it
is an important probe as it allows us to test if the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model can indeed accurately describe the evolution of structures across
billions of years. It is then quite significant that the Planck satellite has
detected, via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, less clusters than expected
according to the primary CMB anisotropies. One of the simplest generalizations
that could reconcile these observations is to consider models in which dark
energy is allowed to cluster, i.e., allowing its sound speed to vary. In this
case, however, the standard methods to compute the abundance of galaxy clusters
need to be adapted to account for the contributions of dark energy. In
particular, we examine the case of clustering dark energy -- a dark energy
fluid with negligible sound speed -- with a redshift-dependent equation of
state. We carefully study how the halo mass function is modified in this
scenario, highlighting corrections that have not been considered before in the
literature. We address modifications in the growth function, collapse
threshold, virialization densities and also changes in the comoving scale of
collapse and mass function normalization. Our results show that clustering dark
energy can impact halo abundances at the level of 10\%--30\%, depending on the
halo mass, and that cluster counts are modified by about 30\% at a redshift of
unity.

models, that allows us to treat system-identification problems in which a
linear system is subject to a partially unknown input signal. To encode prior
information about the input or the linear system, we use Gaussian-process
models. We estimate the model from data using the empirical Bayes approach: the
input and the impulse responses of the linear system are estimated using the
posterior means of the Gaussian-process models given the data, and the
hyperparameters that characterize the Gaussian-process models are estimated
from the marginal likelihood of the data. We propose an iterative algorithm to
find the hyperparameters that relies on the EM method and results in simple
update steps. In the most general formulation, neither the marginal likelihood
nor the posterior distribution of the unknowns is tractable. Therefore, we
propose two approximation approaches, one based on Markov-chain Monte Carlo
techniques and one based on variational Bayes approximation. We also show
special model structures for which the distributions are treatable exactly.
Through numerical simulations, we study the application of the uncertain-input
model to the identification of Hammerstein systems and cascaded linear systems.
As part of the contribution of the paper, we show that this model structure
encompasses many classical problems in system identification such as classical
PEM, Hammerstein models, errors-in-variables problems, blind system
identification, and cascaded linear systems. This allows us to build a
systematic procedure to apply the algorithms proposed in this work to a wide
class of classical problems.

attractive defense strategy against adversarial attacks. We empirically show

numerous applications and to their theoretical significance. In particular,
constant-weight codes have been proposed for error correction in store and
forward. In this paper, we introduce constant-weight array codes (CWACs), which
offer a tradeoff between the rate gain of general constant-weight codes and the
low decoding complexity of liftings. CWACs can either be used in the on-shot
setting introduced earlier or in a multi-shot approach, where one codeword
consists of several messages. The multi-shot approach generalizes the one-shot
approach and hence allows for higher rate gains. We first give a construction
of CWACs based on concatenation, which generalizes the traditional erasure
codes, and also provide a decoding algorithm for these codes. Since CWACs can
be viewed as a generalization of both binary constant-weight codes and
nonrestricted Hamming metric codes, CWACs thus provide an additional degree of
freedom to both problems of determining the maximum cardinality of
constant-weight codes and nonrestricted Hamming metric codes. We then
investigate their theoretical significance. We first generalize many classical
bounds derived for Hamming metric codes or constant-weight codes in the CWAC
framework. We finally relate the maximum cardinality of a CWAC to that of a

amplitude of the incident optical field i.e. the number of photons. However,
multi-photon absorption is generally weak and multi-photon events occur with
extremely low probability. Consequently, it is extremely challenging to
engineer quantum nonlinear devices that operate at the single photon level and
the majority of quantum technologies have to rely on single photon
interactions. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that
exploiting coherent absorption of N = 2 N00N states makes it possible to
enhance the number of two-photon states that are absorbed. An absorbing
metasurface placed inside a Sagnac-style interferometer into which we inject an
N = 2 N00N state, exhibits two-photon absorption with 40.5% efficiency, close
to the theoretical maximum. This high probability of simultaneous absorption of
two photons holds the promise for applications in fields that require
multi-photon upconversion but are hindered by high peak intensities.

This paper provides a first step in that direction.
  The basic issue is the presence of an open set of $n$-tuples of strings which
cannot be chronologically ordered. We resolve it by showing that almost all
such string configurations can be dissected into finitely many pieces which can
indeed be chronologically ordered. This fixes the time-ordered products of
linear field factors outside a nullset of string configurations. (The extension
across the nullset, as well as the definition of time-ordered products of Wick

use high-energy atmospheric neutrinos observed at the IceCube Neutrino

together with high statistics, let us perform the most precise test of
space-time symmetry in the neutrino sector to date. We find no evidence for
Lorentz violation. This allows us to constrain the size of the dimension-four
operator in the Standard-Model Extension for Lorentz violation to the
$10^{-28}$ level and to set limits on higher dimensional operators of that
theory. These are among the most stringent limits on Lorentz violation across
all fields of physics.

used to obtain powerful numerical techniques to solve polynomial optimization
(PO) problems. Putinar's certificate uses sum-of-squares (sos) polynomials to
certify the non-negativity of a given polynomial over a domain defined by
polynomial inequalities. This certificate assumes the Archimedean property of
the associated quadratic module, which in particular implies compactness of the
domain. In this paper we characterize the existence of a certificate of
non-negativity for polynomials over a possibly unbounded domain, without the
use of the associated quadratic module. Next, we show that the certificate can
be used to convergent linear matrix inequality (LMI) hierarchies for PO
problems with unbounded feasible sets. Furthermore, by using copositive
polynomials to certify non-negativity, instead of sos polynomials, the
certificate allows the use of a very rich class of convergent LMI hierarchies
to approximate the solution of general PO problems. Throughout the article we
illustrate our results with various examples certifying the non-negativity of
polynomials over possibly unbounded sets defined by polynomial equalities or
inequalities.

binary and multiple systems and to provide an independent and homogeneous
determination of the atmospheric properties and vsini for all targets. The
objective is to identify the physical cause of the low frequencies. We computed
1-D cross-correlation functions (CCFs) in order to find the best parameters in
terms of the number of components, spectral type and vsini for each target.
Radial velocities were measured from spectrum synthesis and by using a 2-D
cross-correlation technique in the case of double- and triple-lined systems.
Fundamental parameters were determined by fitting (composite) synthetic spectra
to the normalised median spectra corrected for the appropriate Doppler shifts.
We report on the analysis of 478 high-resolution Hermes and 41 Ace spectra of

classified our targets based on the shape of the CCFs and the temporal
behaviour of the radial velocities. We derived orbital solutions for seven new
systems. Three long-period preliminary orbital solutions are confirmed by a
photometric time-delay analysis. Finally, we determined a global multiplicity

graphs, correspond to generating random adjacency matrices where each entry is
non-zero based on a large matrix of probabilities. Generating an instance of a
random graph based on these models is easy, although inefficient, by flipping
biased coins (i.e. sampling binomial random variables) for each possible edge.
This process is inefficient because most large graph models correspond to
sparse graphs where the vast majority of coin flips will result in no edges. We
describe some not-entirely-well-known, but not-entirely-unknown, techniques
that will enable us to sample a graph by finding only the coin flips that will
produce edges. Our analogies for these procedures are ball-dropping, which is
easier to implement, but may need extra work due to duplicate edges, and
grass-hopping, which results in no duplicated work or extra edges.
  Grass-hopping does this using geometric random variables. In order to use
this idea on complex probability matrices such as those in Kronecker graphs, we
decompose the problem into three steps, each of which are independently useful
computational primitives: (i) enumerating non-decreasing sequences, (ii)
unranking multiset permutations, and (iii) decoding and encoding z-curve and
Morton codes and permutations. The third step is the result of a new connection
between repeated Kronecker product operations and Morton codes. Throughout, we

moments when the random process hits the boundary of a given subset of the
state set is proposed and studied. The general concept of the model is
formulated and its possible applications in technical and economic systems are
described. Two versions of the general stochastic model, the version based on
the use of a continuous-time semi-Markov process with embedded absorbing Markov
chain and the version based on the use of a discrete-time Markov process with
absorbing states, are analyzed. New representations of the stationary cost
index of the control quality are obtained for both versions. It is shown that
this index can be represented as a linear-fractional integral functional of two
discrete probability distributions determining the control strategy. The
results obtained by the author of this paper about an extremum of such
functionals were used to prove that, in both versions of the model, the control
is deterministic and is determined by the extremum points of functions of two
discrete arguments for which the explicit analytic representations are
obtained. The perspectives of the further development of this stochastic model
are outlined.

diagnosis of the plasma in the heliosphere and its vicinity. So far,
instruments detecting ENAs from the heliosphere were configured for
observations of hydrogen atoms. Here, we estimate emissions of ENAs of the
heavy chemical elements helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and neon. A large portion of
the heliospheric ENAs is created in the inner heliosheath from neutralized
interstellar pick-up ions (PUIs). We modeled this process and calculated
full-sky intensities of ENAs for energies 0.2-130 keV/nuc. We found that the
largest fluxes among considered species are expected for helium, smaller for
oxygen and nitrogen, and smallest for neon. The obtained intensities are
50-10^6 times smaller than the hydrogen ENA intensities observed by IBEX. The
detection of heavy ENAs will be possible if a future ENA detector is equipped
with the capability to measure the masses of observed atoms. Because of
different reaction cross-sections among the different species, observations of
heavy ENAs can allow for a better understanding of global structure of the
heliosphere as well as the transport and energization of PUIs in the
heliosphere.

control parameter, and the spatial phase structure of eigenstates of the system
Hamiltonian. As a result, the latter coincide (or near coincide) with the dark
states of the operators. In a disorder-free Hamiltonian with a flat band, one
can either obtain a localized asymptotic state or populate whole flat and/or
dispersive bands, depending on the value of the control parameter. In a
disordered Anderson system, the asymptotic state can be localized anywhere in
the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. The dissipative control is robust with respect

modified lattice rules"". In the 1994 paper, Niederreiter & Sloan concentrate
explicitly on Fibonacci lattice rules, which are a particular good choice of
2-dimensional lattice rules. Error bounds in this series of papers were given
related to the star discrepancy.
  In this paper we pose the problem in terms of the so-called unanchored
Sobolev space, which is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space often studied
nowadays in which functions have $L_2$-integrable mixed first derivatives. It
is known constructively that randomly shifted lattice rules, as well as
deterministic tent-transformed lattice rules and deterministic fully
symmetrized lattice rules can achieve close to $O(N^{-1})$ convergence in this
space, see Sloan, Kuo & Joe (2002) and Dick, Nuyens & Pillichshammer (2014)
respectively.
  We derive a break down of the worst-case error of vertex modified lattice
rules in the unanchored Sobolev space in terms of the worst-case error in a
Korobov space, a multilinear space and some additional ""mixture term"". For the
1-dimensional case this worst-case error is obvious and gives an explicit
expression for the trapezoidal rule. In the 2-dimensional case this mixture
term also takes on an explicit form for which we derive upper and lower bounds.
For this case we prove that there exist lattice rules with a nice worst-case
error bound with the additional mixture term of the form $N^{-1} \log^2(N)$.

matter fields of the late Universe. As the large-scale structure is the target
of current and future observational campaigns, one would ideally like to have
the full probability density function of these non-Gaussian fields. The only
viable way we see to achieve this analytically, at least approximately and in
the near future, is via the Edgeworth expansion. We hence rederive this
expansion for Fourier modes of non-Gaussian fields and then continue by putting
it into a wider statistical context than previously done. We show that in its
original form, the Edgeworth expansion only works if the non-Gaussian signal is
averaged away. This is counterproductive, since we target the
parameter-dependent non-Gaussianities as a signal of interest. We hence alter
the analysis at the decisive step and now provide a roadmap towards a
controlled and unadulterated analysis of non-Gaussianities in structure
formation (with the Edgeworth expansion). Our central result is that, although
the Edgeworth expansion has pathological properties, these can be predicted and
avoided in a careful manner. We also show that, despite the non-Gaussianity
coupling all modes, the Edgeworth series may be applied to any desired subset
of modes, since this is equivalent (to the level of the approximation) to
marginalising over the exlcuded modes. In this first paper of a series, we
restrict ourselves to the sampling properties of the Edgeworth expansion,
i.e.~how faithfully it reproduces the distribution of non-Gaussian data. A
follow-up paper will detail its Bayesian use, when parameters are to be

accretion and starburst activity and on expanding blast wave as the mechanism
to communicate outwards the energy injected into the interstellar medium by the
active nucleus. We compare the model predictions with the latest measurement of
the EGB spectrum performed by the Fermi-LAT in the range between 100 MeV and
820 GeV. We find that AGN winds can provide ~35$\pm$15% of the observed EGB in
the energy interval E_{\gamma}=0.1-1 GeV, for ~73$\pm$15% at E_{\gamma}=1-10

EGB is predicted to be larger by a factor of 3-5 than that provided by
star-forming galaxies (quiescent plus starburst) in the hierarchical clustering
scenario. The cumulative gamma-ray emission from AGN winds and blazars can
account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the EGB, assuming the standard
acceleration theory, and AGN wind parameters that agree with observations. We
also compare the model prediction for the cumulative neutrino background from
AGN winds with the most recent IceCube data. We find that for AGN winds with

global fit parameters are needed in addition to information on nuclear
deformation, taken from Hartree Fock Bogolyubov (HFB) calculations with the
Gogny force, and the generator coordinator method (GCM) assures properly
defined angular momentum. For a large number of nuclei the GDR shapes and the
photon strength are described by the sum of three Lorentzians (TLO),
extrapolated to low energies and normalized in accordance to the dipole sum
rule. Level densities are influenced strongly by the significant collective
enhancement based on the breaking of shape symmetry. The replacement of axial
symmetry by the less stringent requirement of invariance against rotation by
180 degree leads to a novel prediction for radiative neutron capture. It
compares well to recent compilations of average radiative widths and Maxwellian
average cross sections for neutron capture by even target nuclei. An extension
to higher spin promises a reliable prediction for various compound nuclear

mechanism of metronomes such that SHIL can happen more easily. Then we verify
the occurrence of SHIL in experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first

insights into the modelling, simulation, analysis and design of nonlinear
oscillators. The demonstration is also suitable to use for teaching the subject
of injection locking and SHIL.

used to achieve a desired pulse duration in a target or sample, and precise
temporal characterization is important. The dispersion-scan (d-scan) pulse
characterization technique usually involves using glass wedges to impart
variable, well-defined amounts of dispersion to the pulses, while measuring the
spectrum of a nonlinear signal produced by those pulses. This works very well
for broadband few-cycle pulses, but longer, narrower bandwidth pulses are much
more difficult to measure this way. Here we demonstrate the concept of
self-calibrating d-scan, which extends the applicability of the d-scan
technique to pulses of arbitrary duration, enabling their complete measurement
without prior knowledge of the introduced dispersion. In particular, we show
that the pulse compressors already employed in chirped pulse amplification

profile of the output pulses on-target in a simple way, without the need of
additional diagnostics or calibrations, while at the same time calibrating the
often-unknown differential dispersion of the compressor itself. We demonstrate
the technique through simulations and experiments under known conditions.

exhibited an Arrhenius type diffusion in the range of 1200-1600{\deg}C. The

the fastest grain boundary paths for the Cs diffusion. The diffusion
coefficients in HEGB are clearly a few orders of magnitude lower than the
