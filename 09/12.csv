  Annotations",,,"10.5518/249",,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a novel activity dataset which exhibits real-life and
diverse scenarios of complex, temporally-extended human activities and actions.
The dataset presents a set of videos of actors performing everyday activities
in a natural and unscripted manner. The dataset was recorded using a static
Kinect 2 sensor which is commonly used on many robotic platforms. The dataset
comprises of RGB-D images, point cloud data, automatically generated skeleton
tracks in addition to crowdsourced annotations. Furthermore, we also describe
the methodology used to acquire annotations through crowdsourcing. Finally some
activity recognition benchmarks are presented using current state-of-the-art
techniques. We believe that this dataset is particularly suitable as a testbed
for activity recognition research but it can also be applicable for other
common tasks in robotics/computer vision research such as object detection and
human skeleton tracking.

renormalization group properties consistently, has been shown to solve the
scale dependence problem that plagues the evaluation of thermodynamical
quantities, e.g., within the framework of approximations such as in the
hard-thermal-loop resummed perturbation theory. This method is used in the
present work to evaluate thermodynamical quantities within the two-dimensional
nonlinear sigma model, which, apart from providing a technically simpler
testing ground, shares some common features with Yang-Mills theories, like
asymptotic freedom, trace anomaly and the nonperturbative generation of a mass
gap. The present application confirms that nonperturbative results can be
readily generated solely by considering the lowest-order (quasi-particle)
contribution to the thermodynamic effective potential, when this quantity is
required to be renormalization group invariant. We also show that when the
next-to-leading correction from the method is accounted for, the results
indicate convergence, apart from optimally preserving, within the
approximations here considered, the sought-after scale invariance.

a combination of the magneto-dipole radiation and dipole magnetic field decay
models. By introducing a mean rotation energy conversion coefficient
$\overline{\zeta}$, the ratio of the total high-energy photon energy to the
total rotation energy loss in the whole life of the pulsar, and combining the
pulsar's high-energy and timing observations with reliable nuclear equation of
state, we estimate the pulsar's initial spin period, $P_{0}\sim (17-44)$ ms,
corresponding to the moment of inertia $I\sim (0.8-2.1)\times 10^{45}$ g
cm$^{2}$. Assuming that PSR J1640$-$4631 has experienced a long-term
exponential decay of the dipole magnetic field, we calculate the true age
$t_{\rm age}$, the effective magnetic field decay timescale $\tau_{D}$, and the
initial surface dipole magnetic field at the pole $B_{p}(0)$ of the pulsar to
be $(2900-3100)$ yrs, $1.07(2)\times10^{5}$ yrs, and $(1.84-4.20)\times10^{13}$
G, respectively. The measured braking index of $n=3.15(3)$ for PSR J1640$-$4631
is attributed to its long-term dipole magnetic field decay and a low magnetic
field decay rate, $dB_{\rm p}/dt\sim -(1.66-3.85)\times10^{8}$ G yr$^{-1}$. Our
model can be applied to both the high braking index ($n>3$) and low braking
index ($n<3$) pulsars, tested by the future polarization, timing, and
high-energy observations of PSR J1640$-$4631.

effective-medium approaches, applicable to certain classes of systems. In the
present work, the inconsistency of differential models for macroscopically
homogeneous and isotropic systems is illustrated with a model for the effective
permittivity of simple dielectric systems of impenetrable balls. The analysis
is carried out in terms of the compact group approach reformulated in a way
that allows one to analyze the role of different contributions to the
permittivity distribution in the system. It is shown that the asymmetrical
Bruggeman model (ABM) is physically inconsistent since the electromagnetic
interaction between previously added constituents and those being added is
replaced by the interaction of the latter with recursively formed effective
medium. The overall changes in the effective permittivity due to addition of
one constituent include the contributions from both constituents and depend on
the system structure before the addition. Ignoring the contribution from one of
the constituents, we obtain generalized versions of the original ABM mixing
rules. They still remain applicable only in a certain concentration ranges, as
is shown with the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. The results obtained can be
generalized to macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic systems with complex
permittivities of constituents.

represents a challenging suite of problems in modern statistics. In this work
we analyse the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution, a two
parameter generalisation of the Poisson distribution. COM-Poisson regression
modelling allows the flexibility to model dispersed count data as part of a
generalised linear model (GLM) with a COM-Poisson response, where exogenous
covariates control the mean and dispersion level of the response. The major
difficulty with COM-Poisson regression is that the likelihood function contains
multiple intractable normalising constants and is not amenable to standard
inference and MCMC techniques. Recent work by Chanialidis et al. (2017) has
seen the development of a sampler to draw random variates from the COM-Poisson
likelihood using a rejection sampling algorithm. We provide a new rejection
sampler for the COM-Poisson distribution which significantly reduces the CPU
time required to perform inference for COM-Poisson regression models. A novel
extension of this work shows that for any intractable likelihood function with
an associated rejection sampler it is possible to construct unbiased estimators
of the intractable likelihood which proves useful for model selection or for
use within pseudo-marginal MCMC algorithms (Andrieu and Roberts, 2009). We
demonstrate all of these methods on a real-world dataset of takeover bids.

  Games",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A commonly used technique for managing AI complexity in real-time strategy
(RTS) games is to use action and/or state abstractions. High-level abstractions
can often lead to good strategic decision making, but tactical decision quality
may suffer due to lost details. A competing method is to sample the search
space which often leads to good tactical performance in simple scenarios, but
poor high-level planning.
  We propose to use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to select among a
limited set of abstract action choices, and to utilize the remaining
computation time for game tree search to improve low level tactics. The CNN is
trained by supervised learning on game states labelled by Puppet Search, a
strategic search algorithm that uses action abstractions. The network is then
used to select a script --- an abstract action --- to produce low level actions
for all units. Subsequently, the game tree search algorithm improves the
tactical actions of a subset of units using a limited view of the game state
only considering units close to opponent units.
  Experiments in the microRTS game show that the combined algorithm results in
higher win-rates than either of its two independent components and other
state-of-the-art microRTS agents.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of a
convolutional network to play a full RTS game on standard game maps, as
previous work has focused on sub-problems, such as combat, or on very small
maps.

dimensionality reduction and visualization of high dimensional data. Apart from
these tasks, it also found applications in the field of geometry processing for
the analysis and reconstruction of non-rigid shapes. In this regard, MDS can be
thought of as a \textit{shape from metric} algorithm, consisting of finding a
configuration of points in the Euclidean space that realize, as isometrically
as possible, some given distance structure. In the present work we cast the
least squares variant of MDS (LS-MDS) in the spectral domain. This uncovers a
multiresolution property of distance scaling which speeds up the optimization
by a significant amount, while producing comparable, and sometimes even better,
embeddings.

increasingly being addressed with deep-learning-based solutions. Established
deep-learning platforms are flexible but do not provide specific functionality
for medical image analysis and adapting them for this application requires
substantial implementation effort. Thus, there has been substantial duplication
of effort and incompatible infrastructure developed across many research
groups. This work presents the open-source NiftyNet platform for deep learning
in medical imaging. The ambition of NiftyNet is to accelerate and simplify the
development of these solutions, and to provide a common mechanism for
disseminating research outputs for the community to use, adapt and build upon.
  NiftyNet provides a modular deep-learning pipeline for a range of medical
imaging applications including segmentation, regression, image generation and
representation learning applications. Components of the NiftyNet pipeline
including data loading, data augmentation, network architectures, loss
functions and evaluation metrics are tailored to, and take advantage of, the
idiosyncracies of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention.
NiftyNet is built on TensorFlow and supports TensorBoard visualization of 2D
and 3D images and computational graphs by default.
  We present 3 illustrative medical image analysis applications built using
NiftyNet: (1) segmentation of multiple abdominal organs from computed
tomography; (2) image regression to predict computed tomography attenuation
maps from brain magnetic resonance images; and (3) generation of simulated
ultrasound images for specified anatomical poses.
  NiftyNet enables researchers to rapidly develop and distribute deep learning
solutions for segmentation, regression, image generation and representation
learning applications, or extend the platform to new applications.

humans. Much research on robot dynamics and control has achieved success on
hyper robot motor capabilities, but mostly through heavily case-specific
engineering. Meanwhile, in terms of robot acquiring skills in a ubiquitous
manner, robot learning from human demonstration (LfD) has achieved great
progress, but still has limitations handling dynamic skills and compound
actions. In this paper, we present a composite learning scheme which goes
beyond LfD and integrates robot learning from human definition, demonstration,
and evaluation. The method tackles advanced motor skills that require dynamic
time-critical maneuver, complex contact control, and handling partly soft
partly rigid objects. We also introduce the ""nunchaku flipping challenge"", an
extreme test that puts hard requirements to all these three aspects. Continued
from our previous presentations, this paper introduces the latest update of the
composite learning scheme and the physical success of the nunchaku flipping
challenge.

dynamics is governed by the transmission power policy. Different from the
previous work, we consider a discrete time system where transmission power is
kept constant in each slot. We consider two models that capture different
effects of temperature. In the first model, the temperature is constrained to
be below a critical temperature at all time instants; we coin this model as
explicit temperature constrained model. We investigate throughput optimal power
allocation for multiple energy arrivals under general, as well as temperature
and energy limited regimes. We show that the optimal power allocation for the
temperature limited case is monotone decreasing. In the second model, we
consider the effect of the temperature on the channel quality via its influence
on additive noise power; we coin this model as implicit temperature constrained
model. In this model, the change in the variance of the additive noise due to
previous transmissions is non-negligible. In particular, transmitted signals
contribute as interference for all subsequent slots and thus affect the signal
to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). In this case, we investigate
throughput optimal power allocation under general, as well as low and high SINR
regimes. We show in the low SINR regime that the optimal allocation dictates
the transmitter to save its harvested energy till the last slot. In the high
SINR regime, we show that the optimal power sequence is monotone increasing.
Finally, we consider the case in which implicit and explicit temperature
constraints are simultaneously active and we show under certain conditions that
the optimal power sequence is monotone decreasing.

expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is
Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates
between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian.
Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general
families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of
unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a
fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz
supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of
states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a
broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a
desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more
efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework.
Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard
constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and
soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient
implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating
operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact
optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings
for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse

redshift measurements. The method is based on the presence of a reference
sample for which a precise redshift number distribution (dN/dz) can be obtained
for different pencil-beam-like sub-volumes within the original survey. For each
sub-volume we then impose: (i) that the redshift number distribution of the
uncertain redshift measurements matches the reference dN/dz corrected by their
selection functions; and (ii) the rank order in redshift of the original
ensemble of uncertain measurements is preserved. The latter step is motivated
by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density
functions (PDFs) of different means and arbitrarily large standard deviations
satisfy stochastic ordering. We then repeat this simple algorithm for multiple
arbitrary pencil-beam-like overlapping sub-volumes; in this manner, each
uncertain measurement has multiple (non-independent) ""recovered"" redshifts
which can be used to estimate a new redshift PDF. We refer to this method as
the Stochastic Order Redshift Technique (SORT). We have used a state-of-the-art
N-body simulation to test the performance of SORT under simple assumptions and
found that it can improve the quality of cosmological redshifts in an efficient
and robust manner. Particularly, SORT redshifts are able to recover the
distinctive features of the 'cosmic web' and can provide unbiased measurement
of the two-point correlation function on scales > 4 Mpc/h. Given its
simplicity, we envision that a method like SORT can be incorporated into more
sophisticated algorithms aimed to exploit the full potential of large
extragalactic photometric surveys.

to be the case as we show explicitly at the example of the Georgi-Machacek

smallness of the $\rho$ parameter. However, the model cannot be renormalised
on-shell without breaking the custodial symmetry. Moreover, we find that it can
often happen that the radiative corrections are so large that any consideration
based on a perturbative expansion appears to be meaningless: counter-terms to
quartic couplings can become much larger than $4\pi$ and/or two-loop mass

necessary to single out parameter regions which cannot be treated
perturbatively. We propose and discuss different sets of such perturbativity
conditions and show their impact on the parameter space of the Georgi-Machacek

applied to other models as well. We also point out that the vacuum stability
constraints in the Georgi-Machacek model, which have so far only been applied

explanation. We revisit the energy budget of this planet by considering the
impact of reflected light on dayside measurements, and the physicality of
implied nightside temperatures. Previous analyses of the infrared eclipses of
WASP-43b have assumed reflected light from the planet is negligible and can be
ignored. We develop a phenomenological eclipse model including reflected light,
thermal emission, and water absorption, and use it to fit published Hubble and
Spitzer eclipse data. We infer a near-infrared geometric albedo of 27$\pm1\%$
and a cooler dayside temperature of $1527 \pm 10~$K. Additionally, we perform
lightcurve inversion on the three published orbital phase curves of WASP-43b
and find that each requires unphysical, negative flux on the nightside. By
requiring non-negative brightnesses at all longitudes, we correct the
unphysical parts of the maps and obtain a much hotter nightside effective
temperature of $1076 \pm 11~$K. The cooler dayside and hotter nightside
suggests a heat recirculation efficiency of $47\%$ for WASP-43b, essentially
the same as for HD 209458b, another hot Jupiter with nearly the same
temperature. Our analysis therefore reaffirms the trend that planets with lower
irradiation temperatures have more efficient day-night heat transport.
Moreover, we note that 1) reflected light may be significant for many near-IR
eclipse measurements of hot Jupiters, and 2) phase curves should be fit with
physically possible longitudinal brightness profiles --- it is insufficient to
only require that the disk-integrated lightcurve be non-negative.

however, also depends on their stellar populations and interstellar medium
properties, which set, among other things, the production rate of H-ionizing
photons, $\xi_\text{ion}^\star$, and the fraction of these escaping into the
IGM. Given the difficulty of constraining with existing observatories the
physical properties of z>6 galaxies, in this work we focus on a sample of ten
nearby objects showing UV spectral features comparable to those observed at
z>6. We use the new-generation Beagle tool to model the UV-to-optical
photometry and UV/optical emission lines of these Local 'analogues' of
high-redshift galaxies, finding that our relatively simple, yet fully
self-consistent, physical model can successfully reproduce the different

are characterised by high ionization parameters, low dust attenuation, and very
young stellar populations. Through our analysis, we derive a novel diagnostic

only 3.1 kpc away from the quiescent galaxy. We dub the quiescent and dusty
galaxies Jekyll and Hyde, respectively. No dust emission is detected at the
location of Jekyll, implying SFR < 13 Msun/yr, which is the most stringent
upper limit ever obtained for a quiescent galaxy at these redshifts. The two
sources are confirmed to lie at the same redshift thanks to the detection of
[CII]158 in Hyde, which provides one the few robust redshifts for an
""H-dropout"" galaxy. The line has a rotating-disk velocity profile blueshifted
from Jekyll by 549+/-60 km/s, demonstrating that it is produced by another
galaxy. Careful de-blending of the Spitzer imaging confirms the existence of
Hyde, and its non-detection with Hubble requires extreme attenuation by dust.
Modeling the photometry of both galaxies shows that Jekyll has fully quenched
>200 Myr prior to observation and still presents a challenge for models, while
Hyde only harbors moderate star-formation (SFR<120 Msun/yr) and is located at
least a factor 1.4 below the z~4 main sequence. Hyde could also have stopped
forming stars <200 Myr before being observed, which would be consistent with
its hight compactness similar to z~4 quiescent galaxies and its low [CII]/FIR
ratio, but significant SF cannot be ruled out. Finally, we show that Hyde hosts
a dense reservoir of gas comparable to that of extreme starbursts, suggesting
that its SFR was reduced without expelling the gas outside of the galaxy. We
argue that Jekyll and Hyde can be seen as two stages of quenching, and provide
a unique laboratory to study this poorly understood phenomenon. [abridged]

intuitive picture for the existence of these edge modes in the case of
non-interacting spinless fermions with time reversal symmetry (BDI class of the
tenfold way). The stability of this phenomenon relies on a topological
invariant defined in terms of a complex function, counting its zeros and poles
inside the unit circle. This invariant can prevent two models described by the
\emph{same} conformal field theory (CFT) from being smoothly connected. A full
classification of critical phases in the non-interacting BDI class is obtained:
each phase is labeled by the central charge of the CFT, $c \in
\frac{1}{2}\mathbb N$, and the topological invariant, $\omega \in \mathbb Z$.
Moreover, $c$ is determined by the difference in the number of edge modes
between the phases neighboring the transition. Numerical simulations show that
the topological edge modes of critical chains can be stable in the presence of
interactions and disorder.

to 1700 km s$^{-1}$ and outflow rate of 450-1500 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. Near the
spatial center of the conical outflow, CO (J=3-2) emission shows a molecular
gas disc with a total molecular mass ($\rm M_{H_{2}}$) of

gas reservoir thereby directly impacting star formation in the host galaxy. The
observed mass of the supermassive black hole is $10^{9.37-9.56}$M$_{\odot}$ and

the expected value from the local M$\rm_{bulge}-M_{BH}$ relationship. A second
galactic disc observed in nebular emission is offset from the quasar by 9 kpc

injections of thermal and/or kinetic energy, two parametrizations of delayed
cooling feedback and a `mechanical' feedback scheme that injects the correct

disk galaxy setups at different resolutions, with the highest resolution runs
reasonably resolving the Sedov-Taylor phase of the SN, we aim to find a
physically motivated scheme with as few tunable parameters as possible. As
expected, simple injections of energy overcool at all but the highest
resolution. Our delayed cooling schemes result in overstrong feedback,
destroying the disk. The mechanical feedback scheme is efficient at suppressing
star formation, agrees well with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and leads to
converged star formation rates and galaxy morphologies with increasing
resolution without fine tuning any parameters. However, we find it difficult to
produce outflows with high enough mass loading factors at all but the highest

tend to zero (sign-disordered) or remain finite (sign-ordered) depending on
dimensionality and the concentration of negative scattering sites $x$. We show
that in two dimensions the sign-ordered phase is unstable even for arbitrarily
small $x$ by identifying rare destabilizing events. In three dimensions, we
present strong evidence that there is a sign phase transition at a finite $x_c

In 2D insulators at low temperature, the variable range hopping
magnetoresistance is always negative, while in 3D, it changes sign at the point
of the sign phase transition. We also show that in the sign-disordered regime a
small magnetic field may enhance superconductivity in a random system of D-wave
superconducting grains embedded into a metallic matrix. Finally, the existence
of the sign phase transition in 3D implies new features in the spin glass phase

provide the best X-ray light curves for RQQs at $z>4$, to date, enabling
qualitative investigations of the X-ray variability behavior of such sources
for the first time. On average, these sources follow the trend of decreasing
variability amplitude with increasing luminosity, and there is no evidence for
X-ray variability increasing toward higher redshifts, in contrast with earlier
predictions of potential evolutionary scenarios. An ensemble variability
structure function reveals that their variability level remains relatively flat
across $\approx20 - 1000$ days in the rest frame and it is generally lower than
that of three similarly luminous RQQs at $1.33\leq z\leq 2.74$ over the same
temporal range. We discuss possible explanations for the increased variability
of the lower-redshift subsample and, in particular, whether higher accretion
rates play a leading role. Near-simultaneous optical monitoring of the sources
at $4.10\leq z\leq 4.35$ indicates that none is variable on $\approx1$-day
timescales, although flux variations of up to $\sim25$\% are observed on
$\approx100$-day timescales, typical of RQQs at similar redshifts. Significant
optical-X-ray spectral slope variations observed in two of these sources are
consistent with the levels observed in luminous RQQs and are dominated by X-ray
variations.

Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) survey for dark galaxies fluorescently illuminated
by quasars at $z>3$. Compared to previous studies which are based on deep
narrow-band (NB) imaging, our integral field survey provides a nearly uniform
sensitivity coverage over a large volume in redshift space around the quasars
as well as full spectral information at each location. Thanks to these unique
features, we are able to build control samples at large redshift distances from
the quasars using the same data taken under the same conditions. By comparing
the rest-frame equivalent width (EW$_{0}$) distributions of the Ly$\alpha$
sources detected in proximity to the quasars and in control samples, we detect
a clear correlation between the locations of high EW$_{0}$ objects and the
quasars. This correlation is not seen in other properties such as Ly$\alpha$
luminosities or volume overdensities, suggesting the possible fluorescent
nature of at least some of these objects. Among these, we find 6 sources
without continuum counterparts and EW$_{0}$ limits larger than
$240\,\mathrm{\AA}$ that are the best candidates for dark galaxies in our
survey at $z>3.5$. The volume densities and properties, including inferred gas
masses and star formation efficiencies, of these dark galaxy candidates are
similar to previously detected candidates at $z\approx2.4$ in NB surveys.
Moreover, if the most distant of these are fluorescently illuminated by the
quasar, our results also provide a lower limit of $t=60$ Myr on the quasar
lifetime.

images is one of the primitive tasks in document analysis, but unfortunately,
no such method exists that can reliably remove the perspective distortion from
document images automatically. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural
network based method for recovering homography from hand-held camera captured
documents.
  Our proposed method works independent of document's underlying content and is
trained end-to-end in a fully automatic way. Specifically, this paper makes
following three contributions: Firstly, we introduce a large scale synthetic
dataset for recovering homography from documents images captured under
different geometric and photometric transformations; secondly, we show that a
generic convolutional neural network based architecture can be successfully
used for regressing the corners positions of documents captured under wild
settings; thirdly, we show that L1 loss can be reliably used for corners
regression. Our proposed method gives state-of-the-art performance on the
tested datasets, and has potential to become an integral part of document

construction for spontaneously broken spacetime symmetries leads to universal
dynamics. One key difference lies in the role of Goldstone bosons, which for
spacetime symmetries includes a subset which are inessential for the non-linear
realisation and hence can be eliminated. In this paper we address two important
issues that arise when eliminating inessential Goldstones.
  The first concerns the elimination itself, which is often performed by
imposing so-called inverse Higgs constraints. Contrary to claims in the
literature, there are a series of conditions on the structure constants which
must be satisfied to employ the inverse Higgs phenomenon, and we discuss which
parametrisation of the coset element is the most effective in this regard. We
also consider generalisations of the standard inverse Higgs constraints, which
can include integrating out inessential Goldstones at low energies, and prove
that under certain assumptions these give rise to identical effective field
theories for the essential Goldstones.
  Secondly, we consider mappings between non-linear realisations that differ
both in the coset element and the algebra basis. While these can always be
related to each other by a point transformation, remarkably, the inverse Higgs
constraints are not necessarily mapped onto each other under this
transformation. We discuss the physical implications of this non-mapping, with
a particular emphasis on the coset space corresponding to the spontaneous
breaking of the Anti-De Sitter isometries by a Minkowski probe brane.

form a {\it Globally Improved ANT} (GIANT) direction. GIANT is highly
communication efficient and naturally exploits the trade-offs between local
computations and global communications in that more local computations result
in fewer overall rounds of communications. Theoretically, we show that GIANT
enjoys an improved convergence rate as compared with first-order methods and
existing distributed Newton-type methods. Further, and in sharp contrast with
many existing distributed Newton-type methods, as well as popular first-order
methods, a highly advantageous practical feature of GIANT is that it only
involves one tuning parameter. We conduct large-scale experiments on a computer
cluster and, empirically, demonstrate the superior performance of GIANT.

particles onto planetary cores is an important mode of core growth, which
enables the formation of giant planets at large distances and assists planet
formation in general. The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit
theory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For
sufficiently large core mass (in the ""Hill regime""), essentially all particles
of appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the
outer regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the
magnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle
orbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion. We conduct shearing-box
simulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI turbulence
(strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in
the presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to
test the efficiency of pebble accretion at a microphysical level. We find that
accretion remains efficient for marginally coupled particles (dimensionless
stopping time tau_s ~ 0.1 - 1) even in the presence of strong MRI turbulence.
Though more dust particles are brought toward the core by the turbulence, this
effect is largely canceled by a reduction in accretion probability. As a
result, the overall effect of turbulence on the accretion rate is mainly
reflected in the changes in the thickness of the dust layer. On the other hand,
we find that the efficiency of pebble accretion for strongly coupled particles
(down to tau_s ~ 0.01) can be modestly reduced by strong turbulence for
low-mass cores.

pairs---bound wide binaries or unbound but coeval stars---are therefore
sensitive to both the smooth tidal field and gravitational perturbation

comoving pairs using only astrometric data from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric

pc. Without radial velocity measurements for the vast majority of these pairs,
the false-positive rate at these separations is significant (~50%). Here we
present results from our own low-resolution radial-velocity survey of a random
sample of the candidate pairs to identify and validate true comoving star
pairs. Of the 311 observed comoving pairs, we confirm 127 comoving pairs with
separations as large as ~10 pc, our original search limit. Between separations
of 0.001 pc to ~0.5 pc, the number of confirmed pairs per separation decreases
with increasing separation (number per log separation is uniform). From ~0.5 pc
to 10 pc, the number per separation is approximately uniform (number per log
separation increases). We confirm the discovery of a population of comoving
star pairs at very large separations, suggesting that disrupted wide binaries

QMI from several bands the true period can be estimated even when no

average magnitude and sample size is measured using 30,000 synthetic multi-band

several bands is highly beneficial in LSST sparsely-sampled time series,
obtaining an absolute increase in period recovery rate up to 50%. We also show
that the QMI is more robust to noise and light curve length (sample size) than
the multiband generalizations of the Lomb Scargle and Analysis of Variance

spectroscopic redshifts and velocity dispersions from SDSS. We obtain central

structural parameters, mass and density proxies, and demonstrate that most of
the local correlations are still observed up to $z \sim 0.65$; at fixed $M_{\rm

counterparts at larger redshift. We also interpret these trends with a non
universal Initial Mass Function (IMF), finding a strong evolution with
redshift, which contrast independent observations and is at odds with the
effect of galaxy mergers. For a fixed IMF, the galaxy assembly can be
explained, realistically, by mass and size accretion, which can be physically
achieved by a series of minor mergers. We reproduce both the $R_{\rm e}-M_{\rm

scenarios and appropriately interact with other road users, requires the
ability to semantically learn and understand driving environment, oftentimes,
based on analyzing massive amounts of naturalistic driving data. An important
paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and
gain insights is understanding the principal compositions of the entire
traffic, termed as traffic primitives. However, the exploding data growth
presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from high-dimensional
time-series traffic data with various types of road users engaged. Therefore,
automatically extracting primitives is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways
to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic
scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be
appropriate for automated driving applications and also 2) be easily used to
generate new traffic scenarios. However, existing literature does not provide a
method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale traffic data.
The contribution of this paper has two manifolds. The first one is that we
proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of
limited traffic data. The second one is that we introduce a nonparametric
Bayesian learning method -- a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden
Markov model -- to automatically extract primitives from multidimensional
traffic data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed
method is then validated using one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment
results show that the nonparametric Bayesian learning method is able to extract
primitives from traffic scenarios where both the binary and continuous events
coexist.

this paper, we propose a class of test statistics for testing the
quasi-independence which unifies the existing methods and generates new useful

both seem to depend only marginally on the Blazhko phase. The physical origin
of the emission is probably due to the infalling motion of the highest
atmospheric layers, which compresses and heats the gas that is located
immediately above the rising shock wave. The infalling velocity of the hot
compressed region is supersonic, almost 50 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$, while the shock
velocity may be much lower in these pulsation phases. When the H$\alpha$ third
emission appears, the shock is certainly no longer radiative because its
intensity is not sufficient to produce a blueshifted emission component within

of signal processing and machine learning techniques to identify true and false
alarms for five arrhythmia types. This baseline algorithm alone is able to
perform remarkably well, with a sensitivity of 0.908, a specificity of 0.838,

time warping techniques on both the entire alarm signal as well as on a

tachycardia, which has in the literature been one of the hardest arrhythmias to
classify. Such an algorithm with strong performance and efficiency could
potentially be translated for use in the ICU to promote overall patient care

with isotope labeling and spectral modeling from molecular dynamics simulations
to identify the dominant turn conformations that exist in equilibrium ensembles
of the (VPGVG)n family of intrinsically disordered elastin-like peptides.
Numerous models have been proposed to explain the origins of elastin's
elasticity and its counterintuitive ability to become structured upon heating.
However, the structure of elastin remains unassigned because none of the
techniques currently used to study highly disordered amino acid sequences have
a time resolution that is faster than the lifetime of a transient conformation
in a disordered sequence. Because these conformations exchange on time scales
longer than the 5-6 ps required for 2D IR measurements, isotope-edited 2D IR
spectroscopy was chosen to study this family of peptides. This study first
examined the small GVGVPGVG peptide at a series of temperatures and salt
concentrations to assign its dominant turn conformations and to determine what
variables alter the populations of these conformations. These data were then
used to identify the dominant turn conformations that exist in larger
elastin-like peptides including (GVGVP)251. The results indicate that the
(VPGVG)n family of elastin-like peptides contain a high population of both an
irregular turn structure with 2 peptide-peptide hydrogen bonds to the proline
amide C=O group and a conventional turn structure with 1 peptide-peptide
hydrogen bond to the proline amide C=O group. These turn structures are
durable, showing a significant population of closed turns at all temperatures
and salt concentrations studied.

substantially reducing processing time and memory-footprint. Further, we
present general strategies of using SKIS to enhance existing algorithms for
influence estimation and influence maximization which are motivated by
practical applications like viral marketing. Using SKIS, we design high-quality
influence oracle for seed sets with average estimation error up to 10x times
smaller than those using RIS and 6x times smaller than SKIM. In addition, our
influence maximization using SKIS substantially improves the quality of
solutions for greedy algorithms. It achieves up to 10x times speed-up and 4x

clues about the state and very existence of its interior. Quantum mechanically
and in equilibrium, the situation is not much different: Hawking radiation will
now be emitted, but it comes out at an extremely slow rate, is thermal to a
high degree of accuracy and thus carries a minimal amount of information about
the quantum state within the BH. Here, it is shown that the situation is
significantly different when a quantum BH is out of equilibrium. We argue that
the BH can then emit ""supersized"" Hawking radiation with a much larger
amplitude than that emitted in equilibrium. The result is a new type of quantum
hair that can reveal the state and composition of the BH interior to an
external observer. Moreover, the frequency and amplitude of the new hair can be
explained by the observer without invoking any new physical principles. The new
hair decays at a parametrically slow rate in comparison to the Schwarzschild
time scale and can be detected through the emission of gravitational waves (and
possibly other types of waves); for example, during and after a BH-merger
event. The current discussion is motivated by a previous analysis, in the
context of a recently proposed polymer model for the BH interior, that implies
emissions just like those described here. We expect, however, that the new hair

that most galaxies are oblate axisymmetric. We show empirically that the
intrinsic shape of galaxies varies as a function of their rotational support as
measured by the ""spin"" parameter proxy Lambda_Re. In particular, low spin
systems have a higher occurrence of triaxiality, while high spin systems are
more intrinsically flattened and axisymmetric. The intrinsic shape of galaxies
is linked to their formation and merger histories. Galaxies with high spin
values have intrinsic shapes consistent with dissipational minor mergers, while
the intrinsic shape of low-spin systems is consistent with dissipationless
multi-merger assembly histories. This range in assembly histories inferred from
intrinsic shapes is broadly consistent with expectations from cosmological
simulations.

$\sim 2$ to $\sim450$ days after explosion, are presented along with analysis
of its physical properties. The SN shows the broad lines associated with SNe
Ic-3/4 but with a key difference. The early spectra display a strong absorption
feature at $\sim 5400$ \AA\ which is not seen in other SNe~Ic-3/4 at this
epoch. This feature has been attributed to He I in the literature. Spectral
modelling of the SN in the early photospheric phase suggests the presence of
residual He in a C/O dominated shell. However, the behaviour of the He I lines
are unusual when compared with He-rich SNe, showing relatively low velocities
and weakening rather than strengthening over time. The SN is found to rise to
peak $\sim 16$ d after core-collapse reaching a bolometric luminosity of Lp
$\sim 3\times10^{42}$ \ergs. Spectral models, including the nebular epoch, show
that the SN ejected $2.5-4$ \msun\ of material, with $\sim 1.5$ \msun\ below
5000 \kms, and with a kinetic energy of $(4.5-7)\times10^{51}$ erg. The
explosion synthesised $\sim 0.14$ \msun\ of 56Ni. There are significant
uncertainties in E(B-V)host and the distance however, which will affect Lp and
MNi. SN 2016coi exploded in a host similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
and away from star-forming regions. The properties of the SN and the
host-galaxy suggest that the progenitor had $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}$ of $23-28$ \msun\
and was stripped almost entirely down to its C/O core at explosion.

projects out certain double-trace contributions to the OPE. We revisit
causality constraints in large-$N$ CFT from this perspective, and show that the

the compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC

mappings from the set {1, 2, ... , n} to itself under the operation of
composition. Earlier research on the symmetric inverse monoid delineated the
process for determining whether an element of SIM(n) has a kth root. The
problem of enumerating kth roots of a given element of SIM(n) has since been
posed, which is solved in this work. In order to find the number of kth roots
of an element, all that is needed is to know the cycle and path structure of
the element. Conveniently, the cycle and cycle-free components may be
considered separately in calculating the number of kth roots. Since the
enumeration problem has been completed for the symmetric group, this paper only
focuses on the cycle-free elements of SIM(n). The formulae derived for
cycle-free elements of SIM(n) here utilize integer partitions, similar to their
use in the expressions given for the number of kth roots of permutations.

star-formation rate, ""quenching"", in massive disk galaxies is frequently
related to the presence of a bar. Optical and near-IR observations reveal that
nearly 60% of disk galaxies in the local universe are barred, thus it is
important to understand the relationship between bars and star formation in
disk galaxies. Recent observational results imply that the Milky Way quenched
about 9-10 Gyr ago, at the transition between the cessation of the growth of
the kinematically hot, old, metal-poor thick disk and the kinematically colder,
younger, and more metal-rich thin disk. Although perhaps coincidental, the
quenching episode could also be related to the formation of the bar. To explore
the relation between bar formation and star formation in gas rich galaxies
quantitatively, we simulated gas-rich disk isolated galaxies. Our simulations
include prescriptions for star formation, stellar feedback, and for regulating
the multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that the action of stellar bar
efficiently quenches star formation, reducing the star-formation rate by a
factor of 10 in less than 1 Gyr. Analytical and self-consistent galaxy
simulations with bars suggest that the action of the stellar bar increases the
gas random motions within the co-rotation radius of the bar. Indeed, we detect
an increase in the gas velocity dispersion up to 20-35 km/s at the end of the
bar formation phase. The star-formation efficiency decreases rapidly, and in
all of our models, the bar quenches the star formation in the galaxy. The
star-formation efficiency is much lower in simulated barred compared to
unbarred galaxies and more rapid bar formation implies more rapid quenching.

$\tanh(J/T)$ and $\tanh(h/T)$. The quantum problem is a $T=0$ study of the
Ising spin glass in a transverse magnetic field $h_T$ for which we obtain a

and counting of \textit{all} connected clusters that can be embedded in the

each cluster for the quantity being calculated, known as the weight. We discuss
a general method that takes the much smaller list (and count) of all no
free-end (NFE) clusters on a lattice up to some order $n$, and automatically
generates all other clusters and their counts up to the same order. The weights
for finite clusters in both cases have a simple graphical interpretation that
allows us to proceed efficiently for a general configuration of the $\pm J$
bonds, and at the end perform suitable disorder averaging. The order of our
computations is limited by the weight calculations for the high-temperature

-- has traditionally been formulated as a category-level segmentation problem.
Consequently, when there are multiple objects in an image, current methods
cannot count the number of objects in the scene, nor can they determine which
part belongs to which object. We address this problem by segmenting the parts
of objects at an instance-level, such that each pixel in the image is assigned
a part label, as well as the identity of the object it belongs to. Moreover, we
show how this approach benefits us in obtaining segmentations at coarser
granularities as well. Our proposed network is trained end-to-end given
detections, and begins with a category-level segmentation module. Thereafter, a
differentiable Conditional Random Field, defined over a variable number of
instances for every input image, reasons about the identity of each part by
associating it with a human detection. In contrast to other approaches, our
method can handle the varying number of people in each image and our holistic
network produces state-of-the-art results in instance-level part and human
segmentation, together with competitive results in category-level part
segmentation, all achieved by a single forward-pass through our neural network.

fields on those faults. The physics of this problem are modeled using the
equations of linear elasticity. We define a regularized functional to be
minimized for building the image. We first prove that the minimum of that
functional converges to the unique solution of the related fault inverse
problem. Due to inherent uncertainties in measurements, rather than seeking a
deterministic solution to the fault inverse problem, we then consider a
Bayesian approach. In this approach the geometry of the fault is assumed to be
planar, it can thus be modeled by a three dimensional random variable whose
probability density has to be determined knowing surface measurements. The
randomness involved in the unknown slip is teased out by assuming independence
of the priors, and we show how the regularized error functional introduced
earlier can be used to recover the probability density of the geometry
parameter. The advantage of the Bayesian approach is that we obtain a way of
quantifying uncertainties as part of our final answer. On the downside, this
approach leads to a very large computation since the slip is unknown. To
contend with the size of this computation we developed an algorithm for the
numerical solution to the stochastic minimization problem which can be easily
implemented on a parallel multi-core platform and we discuss techniques aimed
at saving on computational time. After showing how this algorithm performs on
simulated data, we apply it to measured data. The data was recorded during a
slow slip event in Guerrero, Mexico.

\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ when provided with noiseless samples from $\mathcal{M}$.
There are many algorithms (e.g., Isomap) that are used in practice to fit
manifolds and thus reduce the dimensionality of a given data set. Ideally, the
estimate $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{put}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ should be an actual
manifold of a certain smoothness; furthermore, $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{put}$
should be arbitrarily close to $\mathcal{M}$ in Hausdorff distance given a
large enough sample. Generally speaking, existing manifold learning algorithms
do not meet these criteria. Fefferman, Mitter, and Narayanan (2016) have
developed an algorithm whose output is provably a manifold. The key idea is to
define an approximate squared-distance function (asdf) to $\mathcal{M}$. Then,
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{put}$ is given by the set of points where the gradient of
the asdf is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the largest $n - d$
eigenvectors of the Hessian of the asdf. As long as the asdf meets certain
regularity conditions, $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{put}$ is a manifold that is
arbitrarily close in Hausdorff distance to $\mathcal{M}$. In this paper, we
define two asdfs that can be calculated from the data and show that they meet
the required regularity conditions. The first asdf is based on kernel density
estimation, and the second is based on estimation of tangent spaces using local
principal components analysis.

full-order interactions within multiple categories and features. Furthermore,
we employ a group $\ell_{1}-$norm regularization to learn the group-wise
feature importance of each view with respect to each app category. Experiments
on two real-world mobile app datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the

total population size is constant and that selection affects only the relative
frequency of strategies. Here, we consider evolutionary game dynamics in an
extended Wright-Fisher process with variable population size. In such a
scenario, it is possible that the entire population becomes extinct. Survival
of the population may depend on which strategy prevails in the game dynamics.
Studying cooperative dilemmas, it is a natural feature of such a model that
cooperators enable survival, while defectors drive extinction. Although
defectors are favored for any mixed population, random drift could lead to
their elimination and the resulting pure-cooperator population could survive.
On the other hand, if the defectors remain, then the population will quickly go
extinct because the frequency of cooperators steadily declines and defectors
alone cannot survive. In a mutation-selection model, we find that (i) a steady
supply of cooperators can enable long-term population survival, provided
selection is sufficiently strong, and (ii) selection can increase the abundance
of cooperators but reduce their relative frequency. Thus, evolutionary game
dynamics in populations with variable size generate a multifaceted notion of
what constitutes a trait's long-term success.

studied family of layered BiS$_2$ superconductors. It attracts special
attention because superconductivity at $T_{sc} = 2.8$ K was found to coexist
with local-moment ferromagnetic order with a Curie temperature $T_C = 7.5$ K.
Recently it was reported that upon replacing S by Se $T_C$ drops and
ferromagnetism becomes of an itinerant nature (Thakur et al., Sci. Reports 6,
37527 (2016)). At the same time $T_{sc}$ increases and it was argued
superconductivity coexists with itinerant ferromagnetism. Here we report a muon
spin rotation and relaxation study ($\mu$SR) conducted to investigate the
coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetic order in
Sr$_{0.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$FBiS$_{2-x}$Se$_x$ with $x=0.5$ and $1.0$. By inspecting
the muon asymmetry function we find that both phases do not coexist on the
microscopic scale, but occupy different sample volumes. For $x=0.5$ and $x=1.0$
we find a ferromagnetic volume fraction of $\sim \, 8 \%$ and $\sim \, 30 \%$
at $T=0.25$ K, well below $T_{C} = 3.4$ K and $T_C = 3.3$ K, respectively. For
$x=1.0$ ($T_{sc} = 2.9$ K) the superconducting phase occupies the remaining
sample volume ($\sim \, 70 \%$), as shown by transverse field experiments that
probe the Gaussian damping due to the vortex lattice. We conclude
ferromagnetism and superconductivity are macroscopically phase separated.

numerical behavior of quantum algorithms, as there does not yet exist a large
viable quantum computer on which to perform numerical tests. Tensor network
(TN) contraction is an algorithmic method that can efficiently simulate some
quantum circuits, often greatly reducing the computational cost over methods
that simulate the full Hilbert space. In this study we implement a tensor
network contraction program for simulating quantum circuits using multi-core
compute nodes. We show simulation results for the Max-Cut problem on 3- through
7-regular graphs using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA),
successfully simulating up to 100 qubits. We test two different methods for
generating the ordering of tensor index contractions: one is based on the tree
decomposition of the line graph, while the other generates ordering using a
straight-forward stochastic scheme. Through studying instances of QAOA
circuits, we show the expected result that as the treewidth of the quantum
circuit's line graph decreases, TN contraction becomes significantly more
efficient than simulating the whole Hilbert space. The results in this work
suggest that tensor contraction methods are superior only when simulating
Max-Cut/QAOA with graphs of regularities approximately five and below. Insight
into this point of equal computational cost helps one determine which
simulation method will be more efficient for a given quantum circuit. The
stochastic contraction method outperforms the line graph based method only when
the time to calculate a reasonable tree decomposition is prohibitively
expensive. Finally, we release our software package, qTorch (Quantum TensOR
Contraction Handler), intended for general quantum circuit simulation.

separated spacecrafts is a great challenge. However, such an event could
provide us a good opportunity to study the evolution of embedded Alfv\'enic
fluctuations (AFs) inside ICME and their contributions to local plasma heating
directly. In this study, an ICME observed by Wind at 1.0 au on March 4-6 1998
is tracked to the location of Ulysess at 5.4 au. AFs are commonly found inside
the ICME at 1.0 au, with an occurrence rate of 21.7% and at broadband
frequencies from 4$\times 10^{-4}$ to 5$\times 10^{-2}$ Hz. When the ICME
propagates to 5.4 au, the Aflv\'enicity decreases significantly, and AFs are
rare and only found at few localized frequencies with the occurrence rate
decreasing to 3.0%. At the same time, the magnetic field intensity at the
AF-rich region has an extra magnetic dissipation except ICME expansion effect.
The energetics of the ICME at different radial distance is also investigated
here. Under similar magnetic field intensity situations at 1.0 au, the
turbulence cascade rate at the AF-rich region is much larger than the value at
the AF-lack region. Moreover, it can maintain as the decrease of magnetic field
intensity if there is lack of AFs. However, when there exists many AFs, it
reduces significantly as the AFs disappear. The turbulence cascade dissipation
rate within the ICME is inferred to be 1622.3 $J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}$,
which satisfies the requirement of local ICME plasma heating rate, 1653.2
$J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}$. We suggest that AF dissipation is responsible for
extra magnetic dissipation and local plasma heating inside ICME.

together with machine learning methods in GWA studies has attracted increasing
attention. However, in real-world, nucleotide-level bio-priors have not been
well-studied to date. Alternatively, studies at gene-level, for example,
protein--protein interactions and pathways, are more rigorous and legitimate,
and it is potentially beneficial to utilize such gene-level priors in GWAS. In
this paper, we proposed a novel two-level structured sparse model, called
Sparse Group Lasso with Group-level Graph structure (SGLGG), for GWAS. It can
be considered as a sparse group Lasso along with a group-level graph Lasso.
Essentially, SGLGG penalizes the nucleotide-level sparsity as well as takes
advantages of gene-level priors (both gene groups and networks), to identifying
phenotype-associated risk SNPs. We employ the alternating direction method of
multipliers algorithm to optimize the proposed model. Our experiments on the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative whole genome sequence data and
neuroimage data demonstrate the effectiveness of SGLGG. As a regression model,
it is competitive to the state-of-the-arts sparse models; as a variable
selection method, SGLGG is promising for identifying Alzheimer's

field singularity and its topological charge defined by the quantized winding
angle of the vector field. Vortices are one of the most fundamental topological
excitations in nature, widely known in hair whorls as the winding of hair
strings, in fluid dynamics as the winding of velocities, in angular-momentum
beams as the winding of phase angle and in superconductors and superfluids as
the winding of order parameters. Nevertheless, vortices have hardly been
observed other than those in the real space. Although band degeneracies, such
as Dirac cones, can be viewed as momentum-space vortices in their mathematical
structures, there lacks a well-defined physical observable whose winding number
is an arbitrary signed integer. Here, we experimentally observed momentum-space
vortices as the winding of far-field polarization vectors in the Brillouin zone
(BZ) of periodic plasmonic structures. Using a home-made polarization-resolved
momentum-space imaging spectroscopy, we completely map out the dispersion,
lifetime and polarization of all radiative states at the visible wavelengths.
The momentum space vortices were experimentally identified by their winding
patterns in the polarization-resolved iso-frequency contours and their
diverging radiative quality factors. Such polarization vortices can exist
robustly on any periodic systems of vectorial fields, while they are not
captured by the existing topological band theory developed for scaler fields.
This work opens up a promising avenue for exploring topological photonics in
the momentum space, studying bound states in continuum (BICs), as well as for
rendering and steering vector beams and designing high-Q plasmonic resonances.

monitor of the novel mechanisms of Android 6 (and further), where it is
possible to grant permissions at run time. Using the programming language of
the proof-assistant Coq we have developed a functional implementation of the
reference validation mechanism and certified its correctness with respect to
the specified reference monitor. Several properties concerning the permission
model of Android 6 and its security mechanisms have been formally formulated
and proved. Applying the program extraction mechanism provided by Coq we have
also derived a certified Haskell prototype of the reference validation
mechanism.

by the public. However, different makeup styles will result in significant
facial appearance changes. It remains a challenging problem to match makeup and
non-makeup face images. This paper proposes a learning from generation approach
for makeup-invariant face verification by introducing a bi-level adversarial
network (BLAN). To alleviate the negative effects from makeup, we first
generate non-makeup images from makeup ones, and then use the synthesized
non-makeup images for further verification. Two adversarial networks in BLAN
are integrated in an end-to-end deep network, with the one on pixel level for
reconstructing appealing facial images and the other on feature level for
preserving identity information. These two networks jointly reduce the sensing
gap between makeup and non-makeup images. Moreover, we make the generator well
constrained by incorporating multiple perceptual losses. Experimental results
on three benchmark makeup face datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art verification accuracy across makeup status and can produce
photo-realistic non-makeup face images.

over-fitting of gating ConvNet caused by the redundancy of parameters, a new
multi-task learning method is designed, which jointly learns the gating fusion
weights for the two streams and learns the gating ConvNet for action

a high accuracy of 94.5% is achieved on the dataset UCF101.

data, multi-view learning has drawn much attention recently. Multi-view
spectral clustering methods based on similarity matrixes or graphs are pretty
popular. Generally, these algorithms learn informative graphs by directly
utilizing original data. However, in the real-world applications, original data
often contain noises and outliers that lead to unreliable graphs. In addition,
different views may have different contributions to data clustering. In this
paper, a novel Multiview Subspace Clustering method unifying Adaptive
neighbours and Metric learning (MSCAM), is proposed to address the above
problems. In this method, we use the subspace representations of different
views to adaptively learn a consensus similarity matrix, uncovering the
subspace structure and avoiding noisy nature of original data. For all views,
we also learn different Mahalanobis matrixes that parameterize the squared
distances and consider the contributions of different views. Further, we
constrain the graph constructed by the similarity matrix to have exact c (c is
the number of clusters) connected components. An iterative algorithm is
developed to solve this optimization problem. Moreover, experiments on a
synthetic dataset and different real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of MSCAM.

the training stage, an objective function is often adopted to optimize the
model parameters. However, in most studies, there is an inconsistency between
the model optimization criterion and the evaluation criterion on the enhanced
speech. For example, in measuring speech intelligibility, most of the
evaluation metric is based on a short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)
measure, while the frame based minimum mean square error (MMSE) between
estimated and clean speech is widely used in optimizing the model. Due to the
inconsistency, there is no guarantee that the trained model can provide optimal
performance in applications. In this study, we propose an end-to-end
utterance-based speech enhancement framework using fully convolutional neural
networks (FCN) to reduce the gap between the model optimization and evaluation

information of long speech segments, or even at the entire utterance level, can
be considered when perception-based objective functions are used for the direct
optimization. As an example, we implement the proposed FCN enhancement
framework to optimize the STOI measure. Experimental results show that the STOI
of test speech is better than conventional MMSE-optimized speech due to the
consistency between the training and evaluation target. Moreover, by
integrating the STOI in model optimization, the intelligibility of human

graph learning. Most of the existing works on multi-view graph embedding aim to
find a shared common node embedding across all the views of the graph by
combining the different views in a specific way. Hub detection, as another
essential topic in graph mining has also drawn extensive attentions in recent
years, especially in the context of brain network analysis. Both the graph
embedding and hub detection relate to the node clustering structure of graphs.
The multi-view graph embedding usually implies the node clustering structure of
the graph based on the multiple views, while the hubs are the boundary-spanning
nodes across different node clusters in the graph and thus may potentially
influence the clustering structure of the graph. However, none of the existing
works in multi-view graph embedding considered the hubs when learning the
multi-view embeddings. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the hub
detection task into the multi-view graph embedding framework so that the two
tasks could benefit each other. Specifically, we propose an auto-weighted
framework of Multi-view Graph Embedding with Hub Detection (MVGE-HD) for brain
network analysis. The MVGE-HD framework learns a unified graph embedding across
all the views while reducing the potential influence of the hubs on blurring
the boundaries between node clusters in the graph, thus leading to a clear and
discriminative node clustering structure for the graph. We apply MVGE-HD on two
real multi-view brain network datasets (i.e., HIV and Bipolar). The
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
framework in brain network analysis for clinical investigation and application.

is favored by natural selection over both neutral drift and defection if return
on investment exceeds a threshold value defined solely by the population size,
game size, and a player's probability of opting-out. Ultimately, increasing the
probability that each player is unable to fulfill her promise of participating
in the public goods game facilitates natural selection of cooperators. We also
use adaptive dynamics to study the coevolution of cooperation and opting-out
behavior. However, given rare mutations minutely different from the original
population, an analysis based on adaptive dynamics suggests that the over time
the population will tend towards complete defection and non-participation, and
subsequently, from there, participating cooperators will stand a chance to
emerge by neutral drift. Nevertheless, increasing the probability of
non-participation decreases the rate at which the population tends towards
defection when participating. Our work sheds light on understanding how
stochastic opting-out emerges in the first place and its role in the evolution
of cooperation.

applications such as network clustering, motion segmentation, face clustering

points into distinct communities based on a set of measurements, each of which
is associated with the values of a certain number of data points. While most of
the prior works focus on a setting in which the number of data points involved
in a measurement is two, this work explores a generalized setting in which the
number can be more than two. Motivated by applications particularly in machine
learning and channel coding, we consider two types of measurements: (1)
homogeneity measurement which indicates whether or not the associated data
points belong to the same community; (2) parity measurement which denotes the
modulo-2 sum of the values of the data points. Such measurements are possibly
corrupted by Bernoulli noise. We characterize the fundamental limits on the
number of measurements required to reconstruct the communities for the

distributed data points is a fundamental task to many graph-based or
kernel-based machine learning algorithms and applications. Such calculations,
involving large, sparse interaction matrices, expose the limitation of
conventional data-and-computation reordering techniques for improving space and
time locality on modern computer memory hierarchies. We introduce a novel
method for obtaining a matrix permutation that renders a desirable sparsity
profile. The method is distinguished by the guiding principle to obtain a
profile that is block-sparse with dense blocks. Our profile model and measure
capture the essential properties affecting space and time locality, and permit
variation in sparsity profile without imposing a restriction to a fixed
pattern. The second distinction lies in an efficient algorithm for obtaining a
desirable profile, via exploring and exploiting multi-scale cluster structure
hidden in but intrinsic to the data. The algorithm accomplishes its task with
key components for lower-dimensional embedding with data-specific principal
feature axes, hierarchical data clustering, multi-level matrix compression
storage, and multi-level interaction computations. We provide experimental
results from case studies with two important data analysis algorithms. The
resulting performance is remarkably comparable to the BLAS performance for the
best-case interaction governed by a regularly banded matrix with the same
sparsity.

challenging problem in heterogeneous face recognition (HFR). This paper
proposes an adversarial discriminative feature learning framework to close the
sensing gap via adversarial learning on both raw-pixel space and compact
feature space. This framework integrates cross-spectral face hallucination and
discriminative feature learning into an end-to-end adversarial network. In the
pixel space, we make use of generative adversarial networks to perform
cross-spectral face hallucination. An elaborate two-path model is introduced to
alleviate the lack of paired images, which gives consideration to both global
structures and local textures. In the feature space, an adversarial loss and a
high-order variance discrepancy loss are employed to measure the global and
local discrepancy between two heterogeneous distributions respectively. These
two losses enhance domain-invariant feature learning and modality independent
noise removing. Experimental results on three NIR-VIS databases show that our
proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art HFR methods, without requiring
of complex network or large-scale training dataset.

effect-induced transverse magnetoresistance in ferromagnet (FM)/non-magnetic
heavy metal (HM) bilayers. We observe that the magnitude of transverse
magnetoresistance (i.e., planar Nernst signal) in FM/HM bilayers is
significantly modified by HM and its thickness. This strong dependence of
transverse magnetoresistance on HM evidences the spin Nernst effect in HM; the
generation of thermally-induced spin current in HM and its subsequent
reflection at the FM/HM interface. Our analysis of transverse magnetoresistance
shows that the spin Nernst angles of W and Pt have the opposite sign to their
spin Hall angles. Moreover, our estimate implies that the magnitude of the spin
Nernst angle would be comparable to that of the spin Hall angle, suggesting an
efficient generation of spin current by the spin Nernst effect.

Efforts are being made to understand the inconsistency and test the validity of
the local master equation. We present a perturbative method to solve the
steady-state solutions of linear local master equations, which are demonstrated
by two simple models. The solving process shows the stationary state as the
result of competition between incoherent operations and the unitary creating
quantum coherence, and consequently relate quantum coherence with thermodynamic
consistency.

polarization-dependent rotation angle and ellipticity of different diffraction
orders emerging from a two-dimensional periodic Au array. The array has square
lattice and circular nanoholes and thus is achiral. We find no polarization
conversion occurs if the diffraction orders lie in the incident plane. However,
for the orders that are diffracted away from the incident plane, their rotation
angle and ellipticity vary considerably with incident angle and polarization.
In particular, dramatic changes in rotation angle and ellipticity are observed
when Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are excited. The experimental
results are consistent with the finite-difference time-domain simulations. The
transverse spin carried by the SPPs and a discrete dipole model are used
complementarily to elucidate such angular and polarization dependences.

ensemble algorithm for uplift modeling. Experiments show that our algorithm can
achieve competitive results on both synthetic and industry-provided data. In

the execution of relational queries, and it has received a lot of attention as
a combinatorial knapsack problem in the past. Various solutions to this very
hard problem have been provided. In contrast to existing literature, we change
the underlying assumptions of the problem definition: we adapt the problem for
systems that store relations in memory, and use complex specification
languages, e.g., Datalog. In our framework, we decompose complex queries into
primitive searches that select tuples in a relation for which an equality
predicate holds. A primitive search can be accelerated by an index exhibiting a
worst-case run-time complexity of log-linear time in the size of the output
result of the primitive search. However, the overheads associated with
maintaining indexes are very costly in terms of memory and computing time.
  In this work, we present an optimal polynomial-time algorithm that finds the
minimal set of indexes of a relation for a given set of primitive searches. An
index may cover more than one primitive search due to the algebraic properties
of the search predicate, which is a conjunction of equalities over the
attributes of a relation. The index search space exhibits a exponential
complexity in the number of attributes in a relation, and, hence brute-force
algorithms searching for solutions in the index domain are infeasible. As a
scaffolding for designing a polynomial-time algorithm, we build a partial order
on search operations and use a constructive version of Dilworth's theorem. We
show a strong relationship between chains of primitive searches (forming a
partial order) and indexes. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
our algorithm for an in-memory Datalog compiler that is able to process
relations with billions of entries in memory.

phenomenological analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in media based on
the dielectric tensor. Then, we calculate the microscopic electromagnetic
response of the current and spin of conduction electrons subjected to $ \alpha$
and $M$, based on linear response theory and the Green's function method.
Firstly, it is found that a large $\alpha$ enhances the anisotropic properties
of the system and enlarges the frequency range in which the electromagnetic
waves have hyperbolic dispersion surfaces and exhibit unusual propagations
known as negative refraction and backward waves. Secondly, we consider the
electromagnetic cross-correlation effects on the wave propagation. These
effects stem from the lack of space inversion symmetry and yield $q$-linear
off-diagonal components in the dielectric tensor. This induces a Rashba-induced
birefringence. In the presence of $M$, there arises an anomalous Hall effect
and the dielectric tensor acquires off-diagonal components linear in $M$. These
components yield the Faraday effect and the Cotton-Mouton effect. When $\alpha$
and $M$ are noncollinear, $M$- and $q$-induced optical phenomena, nonreciprocal
directional dichroism is possible. In these nonreciprocal optical phenomena, a

use line ratios and compare to studies of local early type galaxies to conclude
that this gas is likely excited by post-AGB stars and hence represents a
diffuse gas component in the galaxies. For cluster and group galaxies the
fraction with EW([OII])$>5$\AA\ is $f_{[OII]}=0.08^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ and
$f_{[OII]}=0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$ respectively. For field galaxies we find
$f_{[OII]}=0.27^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, representing a 2.8$\sigma$ difference between
the [OII] fractions for old galaxies between the different environments. We
conclude that a population of old galaxies in all environments has ionized gas
that likely stems from stellar mass loss. In the field galaxies also experience
gas accretion from the cosmic web and in groups and clusters these galaxies
have had their gas accretion shut off by their environment. Additionally,
galaxies with emission preferentially avoid the virialized region of the
cluster in position-velocity space. We discuss the implications of our results,
among which is that gas accretion shutoff is likely effective at group halo
masses (log~${\cal M}/$\msol$>12.8$) and that there are likely multiple gas

occurred in the early Solar System. We find that the leading asymmetric

importance of Kozai cycling during their emplacement histories. Finally,
high-$q$ TNOs should be present in roughly equal numbers on either side of

be detected only when their durations are short). These results indicate that
the simple self-organized criticality model has difficulties in explaining
these flares. We further find that bright flares usually have asymmetric
lightcurves with no statistically evident difference/preference between the

those in some reported studies using GC-quadrupole MS (GC-qMS). The lower limit

evidently higher precision and was deduced to be more competent to reflect
trueness in comparison with the isotopologue-pair scheme. The CSIA-Cl method
developed in this study will be conducive to future studies concerning
transformation processes and source apportionment of PCE and TCE, and light the

(TPD) in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) between 70 and 160 K. Theoretically, the
question is addressed using first-principle periodic density functional theory
(DFT) to represent the organised solid support. The adsorption energy of each
compound is found to be very sensitive to the structural defects of the
aromatic carbonaceous surface: these defects, expected to be present in a large
numbers and great diversity on a realistic surface, significantly increase the
average adsorption energies to more than 50\% as compared to adsorption on
perfect graphene planes. The most stable isomer (CH$_3$CN) interacts more
efficiently with the carbonaceous solid support than the higher energy isomer
(CH$_3$NC), however.

sensitive devices and contention based for other devices. For scheduling
resources between these devices, we give the DEARF resource allocation and
evaluate the scheme with help of simulations. Devices suffer a higher delay
but, at high loads, devices using the proposed scheme are able to save 30%
energy per packet and upto 330% energy per device. Packet delivery ratio is
100% at low loads and 90% at high loads as compared to 95% and 27% given by the
traditional access. Other delay tolerant devices save upto 16% on energy per

methods, a detailed mean-square analysis illustrates the effect of random

design the sampling probability at each node in the graph, with the aim of
optimizing the tradeoff between steady-state performance, graph sampling rate,

states leads to their capture as a polaron, with high self-trapping energies
(from 0.44 to 1.15 eV). Once formed, they mediate the formation of peroxides
and remain localized close to the hole injection source due to the presence of
a large diffusion energy barrier (of at least 0.6eV). Their diffusion mechanism
can be mediated by the presence of hydrogen. The capture of these holes is
correlated with the low off-current observed for a-IGZO transistors, as well
as, with the difficulty to obtain a p-type conductivity. The results further
support the formation of peroxides as being the root cause of Negative bias
illumination stress (NBIS). The strong self-trapping substantially reduces the
injection of holes from the contact and limits the creation of peroxides from a
direct hole injection. In presence of light, the concentration of holes

standard to satisfy the demand of ultra-high-speed communication. It adopts
beamforming technology that can generate directional beams to compensate for
high path loss. In the Association Beamforming Training (A-BFT) phase of
beamforming (BF) training, a station (STA) randomly selects an A-BFT slot to
contend for training opportunity. Due to the limited number of A-BFT slots,
A-BFT phase suffers high probability of collisions in dense user scenarios,
resulting in inefficient training performance. Based on the evaluation of the
IEEE 802.11ad standard and 802.11ay draft in dense user scenarios of mmWave
wireless networks, we propose an enhanced A-BFT beam training and random access
mechanism, including the Separated A-BFT (SA-BFT) and Secondary Backoff A-BFT
(SBA-BFT). The SA-BFT can provide more A-BFT slots and divide A-BFT slots into
two regions by defining a new `E-A-BFT Length' field compared to the legacy
802.11ad A-BFT, thereby maintaining compatibility when 802.11ay devices are
mixed with 802.11ad devices. It can also reduce the collision probability in
dense user scenarios greatly. The SBA-BFT performs secondary backoff with very
small overhead of transmission opportunities within one A-BFT slot, which not
only further reduces collision probability, but also improves the A-BFT slots
utilization. Furthermore, we propose a three-dimensional Markov model to
analyze the performance of the SBA-BFT. The analytical and simulation results
show that both the SA-BFT and the SBA-BFT can significantly improve BF training

velocity modulations. Surprisingly, even for the generic case of flow through a
straight pipe, there is little consensus regarding the influence of pulsation
on the transition threshold to turbulence: while most studies predict a
monotonically increasing threshold with pulsation frequency (i.e. Womersley
number, $\alpha$), others observe a decreasing threshold for identical
parameters and only observe an increasing threshold at low $\alpha$. In the
present study we apply recent advances in the understanding of transition in
steady shear flows to pulsating pipe flow. For moderate pulsation amplitudes we
find that the first instability encountered is subcritical (i.e. requiring
finite amplitude disturbances) and gives rise to localized patches of
turbulence (""puffs"") analogous to steady pipe flow. By monitoring the impact of
pulsation on the lifetime of turbulence we map the onset of turbulence in
parameter space. Transition in pulsatile flow can be separated into three
regimes. At small Womersley numbers the dynamics are dominated by the decay
turbulence suffers during the slower part of the cycle and hence transition is
delayed significantly. As shown in this regime thresholds closely agree with
estimates based on a quasi steady flow assumption only taking puff decay rates
into account. The transition point predicted in the zero $\alpha$ limit equals
to the critical point for steady pipe flow offset by the oscillation Reynolds
number. In the high frequency limit puff lifetimes are identical to those in
steady pipe flow and hence the transition threshold appears to be unaffected by
flow pulsation. In the intermediate frequency regime the transition threshold
sharply drops (with increasing $\alpha$) from the decay dominated (quasi
steady) threshold to the steady pipe flow level.

all possible appearances of objects cannot be registered, especially as new

comparatively small number of prototypes. Therefore, function-based
classification of new objects could be a valuable tool for generic object
recognition. Object functions are closely related to hand-object interactions
during handling of a functional object; i.e., how the hand approaches the
object, which parts of the object and contact the hand, and the shape of the
hand during interaction. Hand-object interactions are helpful for modeling
object functions. However, it is difficult to assign discrete labels to
interactions because an object shape and grasping hand-postures intrinsically
have continuous variations. To describe these interactions, we propose the
interaction descriptor space which is acquired from unlabeled appearances of
human hand-object interactions. By using interaction descriptors, we can
numerically describe the relation between an object's appearance and its
possible interaction with the hand. The model infers the quantitative state of
the interaction from the object image alone. It also identifies the parts of
objects designed for hand interactions such as grips and handles. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can unsupervisedly generate interaction
descriptors that make clusters corresponding to interaction types. And also we
demonstrate that the model can infer possible hand-object interactions.

toxicity, is a central problem of small-molecule based drug discovery.
Molecules can be represented as an undirected graph, and we can utilize graph
convolution networks to predication molecular properties. However, graph
convolutional networks and other graph neural networks all focus on learning
node-level representation rather than graph-level representation. Previous
works simply sum all feature vectors for all nodes in the graph to obtain the
graph feature vector for drug predication. In this paper, we introduce a dummy
super node that is connected with all nodes in the graph by a directed edge as
the representation of the graph and modify the graph operation to help the
dummy super node learn graph-level feature. Thus, we can handle graph-level
classification and regression in the same way as node-level classification and
regression. In addition, we apply focal loss to address class imbalance in drug
datasets. The experiments on MoleculeNet show that our method can effectively
improve the performance of molecular properties predication.

for processing text semantics, common to the above examples, is having some
computational representation of text as an abstract object. Operations on this

  This dissertation contributes a series of such tools, diverse in their
mathematical formulation, but common in their application to model semantic
inferences when machines process text. These tools are principally expressed in
nine distinct models that capture aspects of semantic dependence in highly

Experiments are performed at a fixed pressure and rf power where a crystalline

field. Initially, for various FR scenarios we implement a critical point
analysis and we find solutions which provide cosmic acceleration and under
certain circumstances we can have de-Sitter points as stable late-time
attractors. Then we derive the growth index of matter fluctuations in various
Finsler-Randers cosmologies. Considering cold dark matter and neglecting the
scalar field component from the perturbation analysis we find that the
asymptotic value of the growth index is $\gamma_{\infty}^{(FR)}\approx\frac
{9}{16}$, which is close to that of the concordance $\Lambda$ cosmology,
$\gamma^{(\Lambda)} \approx\frac{6}{11}$. In this context, we show that the
current FR model provides the same Hubble expansion with that of Dvali,
Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) gravity model. However, the two models can be
distinguished at the perturbation level since the growth index of FR model is
$\sim18.2\%$ lower than that of the DPG gravity $\gamma^{(DGP)} \approx
\frac{11}{16}$. If we allow pressure in the matter fluid then we obtain
$\gamma_{\infty}^{(FR)}\approx\frac{9(1+w_{m})(1+2w_{m})}{2[8+3w_{m}%

precisely constrain Galactic chemical evolution models in a wide metallicity

that the LTE analysis of Cr II is a much more reliable source of abundance for
chromium, as Cr I has important NLTE effects. These effects can be clearly seen
when we compare the observed abundances of Cr I and Cr II with GCE models.
While Cr I has a clear disagreement between model and observations, Cr II is
very well modeled. We confirm tight increasing trends of Co and Zn toward lower
metallicities, and a tight flat evolution of Ni relative to Fe. Our results
strongly suggest inhomogeneous enrichment from hypernovae. Our precise stellar

prediction from standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; we also study the relation

different ages, are identified from published experimental data on bulge tests

elastin meshwork and variations in anisotropy of the collagen network are
plausible mechanisms to explain ageing in terms of macroscopic tissue
stiffening. Whereas alterations in elastin affect the low-modulus region of the

A
mapping from a vector to a descriptor that represents essential information can
be automatically generated from a set of vectors without any supervising
information. However, an image and its spatially shifted version are encoded
into different descriptors by an existing ordinary auto-encoder because each
descriptor includes a spatial subpattern and its position. To generate a
descriptor representing a spatial subpattern in an image, we need to normalize
its spatial position in the images prior to training an ordinary auto-encoder;
however, such a normalization is generally difficult for images without obvious
standard positions. We propose a transform invariant auto-encoder and an
inference model of transform parameters. By the proposed method, we can
separate an input into a transform invariant descriptor and transform
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to various auto-encoders without
requiring any special modules or labeled training samples. By applying it to
shift transforms, we can achieve a shift invariant auto-encoder that can
extract a typical spatial subpattern independent of its relative position in a
window. In addition, we can achieve a model that can infer shift parameters
required to restore the input from the typical subpattern. As an example of the
proposed method, we demonstrate that a descriptor generated by a shift

we demonstrate the imitation of a human hand by a robot hand as an example of a

of $(3.48\pm0.87)\times10^{-6}\:{\rm photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ within 3 hours,
which corresponds to an apparent isotropic $\gamma$-ray luminosity of
$\simeq3.84\times10^{45}\:{\rm erg\:s^{-1}}$. The most rapid flare had
e-folding time as short as $1.21\pm0.22$ hours which had never been previously
observed for any radio galaxy in $\gamma$-ray band. Also $\gamma$-ray spectral
changes were observed during these flares: in the flux versus photon index
plane the spectral evolution follows correspondingly a counter clockwise and a
clockwise loop inferred from the light curve generated by an adaptive binning
method. On December 30, 2016 and January 01, 2017 the X-ray photon index
softened ($\Gamma_{\rm X}\simeq 1.75-1.77$) and the flux increased nearly

the most important current scientific challenges. Starting from complex climate
models, a key difficulty is to be able to run long enough simulations in order
to observe those extremely rare events. In physics, chemistry, and biology,
rare event algorithms have recently been developed to compute probabilities of
events that cannot be observed in direct numerical simulations. Here we propose
such an algorithm, specifically designed for extreme heat or cold waves, based
on statistical physics approaches. This gives an improvement of more than two
orders of magnitude in the sampling efficiency. We describe the dynamics of
events that would not be observed otherwise. We show that European extreme heat
waves are related to a global teleconnection pattern involving North America
and Asia. This tool opens a full range of studies, so far impossible, aimed at
assessing quantitatively climate change impacts.

interconnected systems while their use in isolated and remote areas is already
cost competitive with conventional generation. In mini-grids, isolated and far
from the grid, the economics of different technology options (e.g. pure solar
photovoltaic (PV), wind, concentrated solar power (CSP), and open cycle gas
turbine (OCGT)) with different amounts of added capacity is assessed to allow
the peak demand to increase by 5 MW (or 5%) and 10 MW (or 10%). This assessment
is based on keeping the system reliability (measured in loss of load
expectation, LOLE) at the same level as it was before the addition of
conventional and renewable generators. An effective load carrying capability
(ELCC) increase by 5 MW (or 5%) can be realized by adding a 5 MW OCGT or 10 MW
PV and 10 MW wind. An ELCC increase of 10 MW (or 10%) requires either 11 MW
OCGT or 7.2 MW OCGT, 2.7 MW PV, and 8.1 MW wind. In both cases, the solution
with RES has 8% and 4% lower annual costs than the OCGT only solution (assuming
crude costs of $40/barrel). From an economic and system reliability
perspective, systems with low growth rates (<5%) in peak and energy demand
could focus on adding RES capacity while systems with higher growth rates (>5%)
still need to incorporate conventional generation.

conventional generation. Therefore, it is important to consider proper costs to
assess the economics instead of technological aspects only. While some scholars
are in the opinion that RES only adds complexity - as RES production is
volatile and stochastic - others share the opinion that RES has value in terms
of energy savings, as well as capacity savings, and contributes to the
reliability of an energy system. Instead of analyzing the losses as a result of
adding RES, it should be focused on the overall system economics, as this is
more important than if more or less electricity is lost for whatever reason.
Economy of Scale (EoS) can have significant impact on project evaluation, and
therefore should be considered in medium- and long-term planning exercises. As
a result of not limiting RES to minimize losses within the system, the most
economic systems show penetration for photovoltaic of above 80 percent, and for
Wind of above 55 percent, on peak demand for both locations. This shows that
significant energy out of RES is not used during the winter, as the demand is
less than 50 percent of summer RES, adding value to the system, as RES saves
fuel and increases system reliability by decreasing the required electricity
from conventional generation. Dependent on the location, between 30 and 40
percent of peak demand on renewable technologies are required before curtailing
takes place. It looks like the concept of Effective Load Carrying Capacity
(ELCC) is not that important anymore, as prices for RES came down significantly
within the last decades. The RES quality still plays an important role but is
getting less important as RES costs are decreasing further. It is expected that
also average RES quality site will be more economic in several years.

Our method relies on only the measurement of the run time of a baseline
sequential program, the run time of the parallel program, the single-processor
run time of the parallel program, and the total amount of time processors spend
idle, waiting for work.
  In our proposed approach, we establish an equality between the observed
parallel speedups and three terms that we call parallel work, idle time, and
work-inflation, where all terms except work inflation can be measured
empirically, with precision. We then use the equality to calculate the
difficult-to-measure work-inflation term, which includes increased
communication costs and memory effects due to parallel execution. By isolating
the main factors of poor performance, our method enables the programmer to
assign blame to certain properties of the code, such as parallel grain size,
amount of parallelism, and memory usage.
  We present a mathematical model, inspired by the work-span model, that
enables us to justify the interpretation of our measurements. We also introduce
a method to help the programmer to visualize both the relative impact of the
various causes of poor performance and the scaling trends in the causes of poor
performance. Our method fits in a sweet spot in between state-of-the-art
profiling and visualization tools. We illustrate our method by several

(iii) the Poincar\'e asymptotic expansions of these poles and of this minorant

more scientific quantification of privacy risk increases accuracy and
reliability and can thus make it easier to build privacy-friendly systems. We
discuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be decomposed
and quantified, and stress the importance of meaningful metrics and units of
measurement. We suggest a method of quantifying and representing privacy risk
that considers a collection of factors as well as a variety of contexts and
attacker models. We conclude by identifying some of the major research
questions to take this approach further in a variety of application scenarios.

number of pattern recognition problems, it fails to pro-vide sufficient good
results in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification due to two main drawbacks.
The first is due to the random weights and bias of ELM, which may lead to
ill-posed problems. The second is the lack of spatial information for
classification. To tackle these two problems, in this paper, we propose a new
framework for ELM based spectral-spatial classification of HSI, where
probabilistic modelling with sparse representation and weighted composite
features (WCF) are employed respectively to derive the op-timized output
weights and extract spatial features. First, the ELM is represented as a
concave logarithmic likelihood function under statistical modelling using the
maximum a posteriori (MAP). Second, the sparse representation is applied to the
Laplacian prior to effi-ciently determine a logarithmic posterior with a unique
maximum in order to solve the ill-posed problem of ELM. The variable splitting
and the augmented Lagrangian are subsequently used to further reduce the
computation complexity of the proposed algorithm and it has been proven a more
efficient method for speed improvement. Third, the spatial information is
extracted using the weighted compo-site features (WCFs) to construct the
spectral-spatial classification framework. In addition, the lower bound of the
proposed method is derived by a rigorous mathematical proof. Experimental
results on two publicly available HSI data sets demonstrate that the proposed
methodology outperforms ELM and a number of state-of-the-art approaches.

performs exceptionally well on the problems mentioned above. To substantiate

propose an analytical model to predict acoustic relaxation absorption and
clarify composition relaxation contributions based on the rate-determining
energy transfer processes in molecular relaxation in excitable gases. By
combining parallel and series relaxation theory, the proposed model suggests
that the vibration-translation process of the lowest vibrational mode in each
composition provides the primary deexcitation path of the relaxation energy,
and the rate-determining vibration-vibration processes between the lowest mode
and others dominate the coupling energy transfer between different modes. Thus,
each gas composition contributes directly one single relaxation process to the
molecular relaxation in mixture, which can be illustrated by the decomposed
acoustic relaxation absorption spectrum of the single relaxation process. The
proposed model is validated by simulation results in good agreement with
experimental data such as $\mathrm{N_2}$, $\mathrm{O_2}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$,
$\mathrm{CH_4}$ and their mixtures.

are commonly defined, designed and fabricated in different premises across the

attacks, where insiders introduce malicious circuitry into the final products.
Additionally, despite extensive post-fabrication testing, it is not uncommon
for ICs with subtle fabrication errors to make it into production systems.
While many systems may be able to tolerate a few byzantine components, this is
not the case for cryptographic hardware, storing and computing on confidential
data. For this reason, many error and backdoor detection techniques have been
proposed over the years. So far all attempts have been either quickly
circumvented, or come with unrealistically high manufacturing costs and
complexity.
  This paper proposes Myst, a practical high-assurance architecture, that uses
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, and provides strong security
guarantees, even in the presence of multiple malicious or faulty components.
The key idea is to combine protective-redundancy with modern threshold
cryptographic techniques to build a system tolerant to hardware trojans and
errors. To evaluate our design, we build a Hardware Security Module that
provides the highest level of assurance possible with COTS components.
Specifically, we employ more than a hundred COTS secure crypto-coprocessors,
verified to FIPS140-2 Level 4 tamper-resistance standards, and use them to
realize high-confidentiality random number generation, key derivation, public
key decryption and signing. Our experiments show a reasonable computational
overhead (less than 1% for both Decryption and Signing) and an exponential
increase in backdoor-tolerance as more ICs are added.

null threshold. If the epidemic owns partial resistance, we would observe
evident faster-growing outbreaks (discontinuous transitions) and larger final
epidemic sizes for few strong contacts, instead of emergence of null threshold
with increase of strong contacts. Inhibiting effect of infection threshold,
positive roles of strong contacts and strength of strong contacts in promoting

introduce a timescale. We provide an independent extraction of this coefficient
by using the newly-developed SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly

resonance-based approach. We compare the results from SMASH with numerical
solutions of the Boltzmann equation for simple systems using the Chapman-Enskog

that the hadron interaction via resonance formation/decay strongly affects the
transport properties of the system, resulting in significant differences in
$\eta/s$ with respect to other approaches where binary collisions dominate. We
argue that the relaxation time of the system ---which characterizes the shear

collapse encountered in generative adversarial network (GAN). Our idea is
intuitive but proven to be very effective, especially in addressing some key

reverse KL divergences into a unified objective function, thus it exploits the
complementary statistical properties from these divergences to effectively
diversify the estimated density in capturing multi-modes. We term our method
dual discriminator generative adversarial nets (D2GAN) which, unlike GAN, has
two discriminators; and together with a generator, it also has the analogy of a
minimax game, wherein a discriminator rewards high scores for samples from data
distribution whilst another discriminator, conversely, favoring data from the
generator, and the generator produces data to fool both two discriminators. We
develop theoretical analysis to show that, given the maximal discriminators,
optimizing the generator of D2GAN reduces to minimizing both KL and reverse KL
divergences between data distribution and the distribution induced from the
data generated by the generator, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing
problem. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world

considered is one in which the initial state, rather than being the homogeneous
false vacuum, contains false vortices. The question addressed is whether, and,
if so, under which circumstances, the presence of vortices has a significant
catalyzing effect on vacuum decay. After studying the existence and properties
of vortices, we study their decay rate through quantum tunneling using a
variety of techniques. In particular, for so-called thin-wall vortices we
devise a one-parameter family of configurations allowing a quantum-mechanical
calculation of tunneling. Also for thin-wall vortices, we employ the Israel
junction conditions between the interior and exterior spacetimes. Matching
these two spacetimes reveals a decay channel which results in an unstable,
expanding vortex. We find that the tunneling exponent for vortices, which is
the dominant factor in the decay rate, is half that for Coleman-de Luccia
bubbles. This implies that vortices are short-lived, making them cosmologically
significant even for low vortex densities. In the limit of the vanishing
gravitational constant we smoothly recover our earlier results for the decay of
the false vortex in a model without gravity.

atomic-norm-based methods for mmWave FD-MIMO channel estimation under both

existing algorithms such as compressive sensing (CS) or subspace methods, the
atomic-norm-based algorithms do not require to discretize the angle spaces of
the angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) into grids, thus
provide much better accuracy in estimation. In the UPA case, to reduce the
computational complexity, the original large-scale 4D atomic norm minimization
problem is approximately reformulated as a semi-definite program (SDP)
containing two decoupled two-level Toeplitz matrices. The SDP is then solved
via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration
involves only closed-form computations. In the NUPA case, the atomic-norm-based
formulation for channel estimation becomes nonconvex and a

emit gravitational waves during the whole cosmic history and contribute to the
stochastic gravitational wave background at all frequencies. We provide a new
estimate of the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum by considering a
realistic cosmological loop distribution, in scaling, as it can be inferred
from Nambu-Goto numerical simulations. Our result takes into account various
effects neglected so far. We include both gravitational wave emission and
backreaction effects on the loop distribution and show that they produce two
distinct features in the spectrum. Concerning the string microstructure, in
addition to the presence of cusps and kinks, we show that gravitational wave
bursts created by the collision of kinks could dominate the signal for wiggly
strings, a situation which may be favoured in the light of recent numerical
simulations. In view of these new results, we propose four prototypical
scenarios, within the margin of the remaining theoretical uncertainties, for
which we derive the corresponding signal and estimate the constraints on the
string tension put by both the LIGO and European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA)
observations. The less constrained of these scenarios is shown to have a string
tension GU < 7.2 x 10^{-11}, at 95% of confidence. Smooth loops carrying two
cusps per oscillation verify the two-sigma bound GU < 1.0 x 10^{-11} while the
most constrained of all scenarios describes very kinky loops and satisfies GU <
6.7 x 10^{-14} at 95% of confidence.

is shown to be closely related to the concept of contraction. Indeed, for
observable network tracking it is necessary/sufficient to have one node in each
contraction measured. Therefore, nodes in a contraction are equivalent to
recover for loss of observability, implying that contraction size is a key
factor for observability recovery. Here, using a polynomial order contraction
detection algorithm, we analyze the distribution of contractions, studying its
relation with key network properties. Our results show that contraction size is
related to network clustering coefficient and degree heterogeneity.
Particularly, in networks with power-law degree distribution, if the clustering
coefficient is high there are less contractions with smaller size on average.
The implication is that estimation/tracking of such systems requires less
number of measurements, while their observational recovery is more restrictive
in case of sensor failure. Further, in Small-World networks higher degree
heterogeneity implies that there are more contractions with smaller size on
average. Therefore, the estimation of representing system requires more
measurements, and also the recovery of measurement failure is more limited.
These results imply that one can tune the properties of synthetic networks to
alleviate their estimation/observability recovery.

bioactivities (e.g. inhibition of the target), learn a predictive mapping from
molecular representation to activity. Although almost every type of machine
learning method has been applied to QSAR learning there is no agreed single

meta-learning. We first carried out the most comprehensive ever comparison of

influence of the gravitational interaction on the energy levels of
Hydrogen-like ions in Rydberg states within the context of the braneworld

amplified in short distances. We show that, for Rydberg states, the main
contribution for the gravitational potential energy does not come from the rest
energy concentrated on the nucleus but from the energy of the electromagnetic
field created by its electrical charge, which is spread in space. The reason is
connected to the fact that, when the ion is in a Rydberg state with high
angular momentum, the gravitational potential energy is not computable in
zero-width brane approximation due to the gravitational influence of the
electrovacuum in which the lepton is moving. Considering a thick brane
scenario, we calculate the gravitational potential energy associated to the

of finite temperature properties of magnetic metals often using parameters
derived from first principles calculations. In itinerant electron systems,
however, the atomic magnetic moments vary their amplitude with temperature and
the spin Hamiltonian should thus be extended to incorporate the effects of
longitudinal spin fluctuations (LSF). Although the simple phenomenological spin
Hamiltonians describing LSF can be efficiently parameterized in the framework
of the constrained Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) and its extensions,
the fundamental problem concerning the integration in classical spin space
remains. It is generally unknown how to integrate over the spin amplitude. Two
intuitive choices of integration measure have been used up to date; the
Murata-Doniach scalar measure and the simple three dimensional vector measure.
Here we derive the integration measure by considering a classical limit of the
quantum Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian under conditions leading to the proper
classical limit of the commutation relations for all values of the classical
spin amplitude and calculate the corresponding ratio of the number of quantum
states. We show, that the number of quantum states corresponding to the
considered classical spin amplitude is proportional to this amplitude and thus
a non-trivial integration measure must be used. We apply our results to the
first-principles simulation of the Curie temperatures of the two canonical
ferromagnets bcc Fe and fcc Ni using a single-site LSF Hamiltonian with
parameters calculated in the LSDA framework in the Disordered Local Moment
approximation and a fixed spin moment constraint. In the same framework we
compare our results with those obtained from the scalar and vector measures.

fast switching to a field-free configuration. Here we show that this issue can
be addressed elegantly by deliberately adding a small elliptical polarization
component to the dipole beam. In our experiments with single $^{87}$Rb atoms in
a chopped trap, we observe improvements up to a factor 11 of the trap lifetime
compared to the standard, seemingly ideal linear polarization. This effect
results from a modification of heating processes via spin-state diffusion in
state-dependent trapping potentials. We develop Monte-Carlo simulations of the
evolution of the atom's internal and motional states and find that they agree
quantitatively with the experimental data. The method is general and can be

methods used to propagate the evolution of Hamiltonian systems. In this paper,
we introduce a new class of variational integrators that achieve fourth-order
convergence despite having the same integration scheme as traditional
second-order variational integrators. The new class of integrators are created
by replacing a dynamical system's Lagrangian in the variational integration
algorithm with its surrogate Lagrangian. By incorporating the surrogate
Lagrangian the propagation errors induced by variational integrators, up to a
given order, are eliminated. Furthermore, no assumption on the Lagrangian's
structure is made and, therefore, the proposed approach is applicable to a
large range of dynamical systems. In addition, surrogate variational
integrators are also constructed for Hamiltonian systems subjected to holonomic
constraints and external forces. Finally, the methodology is extended to derive
higher-order surrogate variational integrators that achieve an arbitrary order
of accuracy but retain second-order complexity in the integration scheme.
Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach.

for sparsity inducing constraint or regularization. In this paper, we present
ACLIME-ADMM, an efficient two-step algorithm for adaptive structure learning,
which estimates an edge specific parameter $\lambda_{ij}$ in the first step,
and uses these parameters to learn the structure in the second step. Both steps
of our algorithm use (inexact) ADMM to solve suitable linear programs, and all
iterations can be done in closed form in an efficient block parallel manner. We

real data (50 years) of daily global geopotential heights to study information
flow in the atmosphere. ACLIME-ADMM is shown to be efficient, stable, and

interferometry we are able to measure the angular sizes of nearby stars with
uncertainties $\leq 2\%$. We present empirically derived relations of angular
diameters that are calibrated using both a sample of dwarfs/subgiants and a
sample of giant stars. These relations are functions of five color indices in
the visible and near-infrared, and have uncertainties of 1.8-6.5% depending on
the color used. We find that a combined sample of both main-sequence and
evolved stars of A-K spectral types is well fit by a single relation for each
color considered. We find that in the colors considered, metallicity does not
play a statistically significant role in predicting stellar size, leading to a
means of predicting observed sizes of stars from color alone.

hypothesis testing to overcome many of the issues that have hampered standard
data mining approaches to pattern discovery. Most importantly, application of
appropriate statistical tests allows precise control over the risk of false
discoveries -- patterns that are found in the sample data but do not hold in
the wider population from which the sample was drawn. Statistical tests can
also be applied to filter out patterns that are unlikely to be useful, removing
uninformative variations of the key patterns in the data. This tutorial
introduces the key statistical and data mining theory and techniques that
underpin this fast developing field.
  We concentrate on two general classes of patterns: dependency rules that
express statistical dependencies between condition and consequent parts and
dependency sets that express mutual dependence between set elements. We clarify
alternative interpretations of statistical dependence and introduce appropriate
tests for evaluating statistical significance of patterns in different
situations. We also introduce special techniques for controlling the likelihood
of spurious discoveries when multitudes of patterns are evaluated.
  The paper is aimed at a wide variety of audiences. It provides the necessary
statistical background and summary of the state-of-the-art for any data mining

one-dimensional model atmospheres, with convection treated using various
formulations of mixing-length theory. This paper aims to carry out an
investigation of the validity of the quasi-static approximation in the context
of pulsating stars. We check the adequacy of a two-dimensional time-dependent
model of a Cepheid-like variable with focus on its spectroscopic properties.
With the radiation-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD, we construct a two-dimensional
time-dependent envelope model of a Cepheid with $T_\mathrm{eff}= 5600$ K, $\log
g=2.0$, solar metallicity, and a 2.8-day pulsation period. Subsequently, we
perform extensive spectral syntheses of a set of artificial iron lines in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The set of lines allows us to systematically study
effects of line strength, ionization stage, and excitation potential. We
evaluate the microturbulent velocity, line asymmetry, projection factor, and
Doppler shifts. The mean Doppler shift is non-zero and negative, -1 km/s, after
averaging over several full periods and lines. This residual line-of-sight
velocity (related to the ""K-term"") is primarily caused by horizontal
inhomogeneities, and consequently we interpret it as the familiar convective
blueshift ubiquitously present in non-pulsating late-type stars. Limited
statistics prevent firm conclusions on the line asymmetries. Our
two-dimensional model provides a reasonably accurate representation of the
spectroscopic properties of a short-period Cepheid-like variable star. Some
properties are primarily controlled by convective inhomogeneities rather than
by the Cepheid-defining pulsations.

regime. However, the demonstration of optical breathers in the normal
dispersion regime remains elusive to our knowledge. Kerr comb generation in
optical microresonators provides an array of oscillators that are highly
coupled via the Kerr effect, which can be exploited to explore the breather
dynamics. Here, we present, experimentally and numerically, the observation of
dark breathers in a normal dispersion silicon nitride microresonator. By
controlling the pump wavelength and power, we can generate the dark breather,
which exhibits an energy exchange between the central lines and the lines at
the wing. The dark breather breathes gently and retains a dark-pulse waveform.
A transition to a chaotic breather state is also observed by increasing the
pump power. These dark breather dynamics are well reproduced by numerical
simulations based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation. The results also reveal the
importance of dissipation to dark breather dynamics and give important insights
into instabilities related to high power dark pulse Kerr combs from normal

knowledge of the underlying network of connections among the system's
components. Unfortunately, in many situations the complete topology of this
network is empirically inaccessible, and one has to resort to probabilistic
techniques to infer it from limited information. While network reconstruction
methods have reached some degree of maturity in the case of single-layer
networks (where nodes can be connected only by one type of links), the problem
is practically unexplored in the case of multiplex networks, where several
interdependent layers, each with a different type of links, coexist. Even the
most advanced network reconstruction techniques, if applied to each layer
separately, fail in replicating the observed inter-layer dependencies making up
the whole coupled multiplex. Here we develop a methodology to reconstruct a
class of correlated multiplexes which includes the World Trade Multiplex as a
specific example we study in detail. Our method starts from any reconstruction
model that successfully reproduces some desired marginal properties, including
node strengths and/or node degrees, of each layer separately. It then
introduces the minimal dependency structure required to replicate an additional
set of higher-order properties that quantify the portion of each node's degree
and each node's strength that is shared and/or reciprocated across pairs of
layers. These properties are found to provide empirically robust measures of
inter-layer coupling. Our method allows joint multi-layer connection
probabilities to be reliably reconstructed from marginal ones, effectively
bridging the gap between single-layer properties and truly multiplex
information.

southern array. The SST-1M project, a 4 m-diameter Davies Cotton telescope with
9 degrees FoV and a 1296 pixels SiPM camera, is designed to meet the
requirements of the next generation ground based gamma-ray observatory CTA in
the energy range above 3 TeV. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) cameras of
gamma-ray telescopes can achieve good performance even during high night sky
background conditions. Defining a fully automated calibration strategy of SiPM
cameras is of great importance for large scale production validation and online
calibration. The SST-1M sub-consortium developed a software compatible with CTA
pipeline software (CTApipe). The calibration of the SST-1M camera is based on
the Camera Test Setup (CTS), a set of LED boards mounted in front of the
camera. The CTS LEDs are operated in pulsed or continuous mode to emulate
signal and night sky background respectively. Continuous and pulsed light data
analysis allows us to extract single pixel calibration parameters to be used
during CTA operation.

traditionally been obtained from two-point statistics. However, non-linear
structure formation renders these statistics insufficient in capturing the full

moments to recover information which would otherwise be lost. We construct
quantities based on non-linear and non-local transformations of weakly
non-Gaussian fields that Gaussianize the full multivariate distribution at a
given order in perturbation theory. Our approach does not require a model of
the fields themselves and takes as input only the first few polyspectra, which

particularly suited to observables lacking a robust perturbative description
such as the weak-lensing shear. We apply our method to simulated density
fields, finding a significantly reduced bispectrum and an enhanced correlation
with the initial field. We demonstrate that our method reconstructs a large
proportion of the linear baryon acoustic oscillations, improving the
information content over the raw field by 35%. We apply the transform to toy
21cm intensity maps, showing that our method still performs well in the

Assuming a distributed, opportunistic scheduling algorithm, we analyse the
system's properties, such as delay, QoS and capacity scaling laws.
Specifically, we start with analyzing the performance while \emph{assuming the
users are not necessarily fully backlogged}, focusing on the queueing problem
and, especially, on the \emph{strong dependence between the queues}. We first
extend a known queueing model by Ephremides and Zhu, to give new results on the
convergence of the probability of collision to its average value (as the number
of users grows), and hence for the ensuing system performance metrics, such as
throughput and delay. This model, however, is limited in the number of users
one can analyze. We thus suggest a new model, which is much simpler yet can
accurately describes the system behaviour when the number of users is large.
  We then proceed to the analysis of this system under the assumption of time
dependent channels. Specifically, we assume each user experiences a different
channel state sequence, expressing different channel fluctuations
(specifically, the Gilbert-Elliott model). The system performance under this
setting is analysed, along with the channel capacity scaling laws.

of two steps: (i) In the first step, we use explicit ROM spatial filtering of
the nonlinear PDE to construct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is
low-dimensional, but is not closed (because of the nonlinearity in the given
PDE). (ii) In the second step, we use data-driven modeling to close the
filtered ROM, i.e., to model the interaction between the resolved and
unresolved modes. To this end, we use a quadratic ansatz to model this
interaction and close the filtered ROM. To find the new coefficients in the
closed filtered ROM, we solve an optimization problem that minimizes the
difference between the full order model data and our ansatz. We emphasize that
the new DDF-ROM is built on general ideas of spatial filtering and optimization
and is independent of (restrictive) phenomenological arguments.
  We investigate the DDF-ROM in the numerical simulation of a 2D channel flow
past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number $Re=100$. The DDF-ROM is
significantly more accurate than the standard projection ROM. Furthermore, the
computational costs of the DDF-ROM and the standard projection ROM are similar,
both costs being orders of magnitude lower than the computational cost of the
full order model. We also compare the new DDF-ROM with modern ROM closure
models in the numerical simulation of the 1D Burgers equation. The DDF-ROM is
more accurate and significantly more efficient than these ROM closure models.

in a porous medium requires solving Darcy's law, a Laplace-like equation, with
a spatially varying tensor permeability. In various scenarios, the permeability
coefficient is sampled at high spatial resolution, which makes solving Darcy's
equation numerically prohibitively expensive. As a consequence, much effort has
gone into creating upscaled or low-resolution effective models of the
coefficient while ensuring that the estimated flow rate is well reproduced,
bringing to fore the classic tradeoff between computational cost and numerical
accuracy. Here we perform a statistical study to characterize the relative
success of upscaling methods on a large sample of permeability coefficients
that are above the percolation threshold. We introduce a new technique based on
Mode-Elimination Renormalization-Group theory (MG) to build coarse-scale
permeability coefficients. Comparing the results with coefficients upscaled
using other methods, we find that MG is consistently more accurate,
particularly so due to its ability to address the tensorial nature of the
coefficients. MG places a low computational demand, in the manner that we have
implemented it, and accurate flow-rate estimates are obtained when using
MG-upscaled permeabilities that approach or are beyond the percolation
threshold.

loads, given an external stimulus. Two approaches to the modeling of such
materials are mainly used in literature, both based on the introduction of a
new tensor: an additive stress $\mathsf{P}_\text{act}$ in the active stress
case and a multiplicative strain $\mathsf{F}_a$ in the active strain one. Aim
of this paper is the comparison between the two approaches on simple shears.
Considering an incompressible and transversely isotropic material, we design
constitutive relations for $\mathsf{P}_\text{act}$ and $\mathsf{F}_a$ so that
they produce the same results for a uniaxial deformation along the symmetry
axis. We then study the two approaches in the case of a simple shear
deformation. In a hyperelastic setting, we show that the two approaches produce
different stress components along a simple shear, unless some necessary
conditions on the strain energy density are fulfilled. However, such conditions
are very restrictive and rule out the usual elastic strain energy functionals.
Active stress and active strain therefore produce different results in shear,
even if they both fit uniaxial data. Our results show that experimental data on
the stress-stretch response on uniaxial deformations are not enough to
establish which activation approach can capture better the mechanics of active
materials. We conclude that other types of deformations, beyond the uniaxial
one, should be taken into consideration in the modeling of such materials.

cross-correlation to non-linear space, which is more robust to signal noises
and distortions. Second, the connection to the existing works shows that KCC
provides a unified solution for correlation filters. Third, KCC is applicable
to any kernel function and is not limited to circulant structure on training
data, thus it is able to predict affine transformations with customized
properties. Last, by leveraging the fast Fourier transform (FFT), KCC
eliminates direct calculation of kernel vectors, thus achieves better
performance yet still with a reasonable computational cost. Comprehensive

attention of researchers, by priorly targeting approximation solutions (e.g.
$\ell_1$-norm, pursuit strategies). On the contrary, this paper considers the

effectively, despite of its complexity. The proposed method reformulates the
problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) and gets the global optimal
solution by applying existing optimization software. Because the main
difficulty of this approach is its computational time, two techniques are
introduced that improve the computational speed. Finally, our method is applied
to image denoising which shows its feasibility and relevance compared to the

and pronounces the related induction principle, and its sibling, the obverse
induction principle. Using this theorem we prove that the poset of closure

that the complete lattice of nuclei on a preframe is a frame, giving some
constructions in the special case of the frame of all nuclei on a frame. In the

lemma. After that we shift a viewpoint and prove some results, analogous to the
results about dcpos, for posets in which certain special subposets have enough
maximal elements; these results actually specialize to dcpos, but at the price
of using the axiom of choice. We conclude by pointing out two convex geometries

such as abnormal event detection in video surveillance and event detection in

use of similarity and correlation in data. Those methods can be inefficient and
yield low accuracy. In recent years, because of the significantly increased
computational power, machine learning techniques have revolutionized many
science and engineering domains. In this study, we apply a deep-learning-based
method to the detection of events from time series seismic signals. However, a
direct adaptation of the similar ideas from 2D object detection to our problem
faces two challenges. The first challenge is that the duration of earthquake
event varies significantly; The other is that the proposals generated are
temporally correlated. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded
region-based convolutional neural network to capture earthquake events in
different sizes, while incorporating contextual information to enrich features
for each individual proposal. To achieve a better generalization performance,
we use densely connected blocks as the backbone of our network. Because of the
fact that some positive events are not correctly annotated, we further
formulate the detection problem as a learning-from-noise problem. To verify the
performance of our detection methods, we employ our methods to seismic data
generated from a bi-axial ""earthquake machine"" located at Rock Mechanics
Laboratory, and we acquire labels with the help of experts. Through our
numerical tests, we show that our novel detection techniques yield high
accuracy. Therefore, our novel deep-learning-based detection methods can
potentially be powerful tools for locating events from time series data in

potentially allows the propagation of the formation and the evolution of
quarkonium in a thermal BIon. When quarks are close to each other, quarkonium
behaves like a scalar and by their getting away, it transits to a fermionic
system. In order to analyze this particular behaviour, a new outlook approach
needs to be adopted as the concurrent view is found deficient to analyse the
aforesaid behaviour. Therefore, the authors' post deliberation accept the
fermions and fermionic being cognate. We need to accept a theory that the
origin of fermions and bosons be the same. However, in $M$-theory, these
particles are independent and for this reason, \textbf{we use a new broader
theory based on Lie-$N$-Algebra and we call it BLNA (Broad Lie-$N$-Algebra)}
theory. Thus, the BLNA in a way the $M$-theory with $11$ dimensions. In this
model, two types of energies with opposite signs emerge from nothing such as
the sum over them becomes zero. They produce two types of branes with opposite
quantum numbers and bosonic fields, which interact with each other and get
compact. By compacting branes, the quarks and anti-quarks are produced on
branes and exchange the graviton and the gravitino. These particles produce two
types of wormholes which act opposite to each other. They preclude from closing
or getting away of branes from each other and also occurrence of confinement.
This confined potential which emerges from these wormholes depends on the
separation distance between quarks and anti-quarks and also on temperature of
system and is reduced to predicted potential in experiments and QCD. Also,
total entropy of this system grows with increasing temperature and produces a
repulsive force which leads to the separation of quarks and anti-quarks and
also to the emergence of deconfinement.

Maxwell--Minkowski field equations is inconsistent with both angular and linear
momentum conservation in this closed system; this very solid fact is the
foundational and continuing issue of the Abraham--Minkowski controversy. The
extant resolution of the Abraham--Minkowski dilemma is to treat Maxwellian
continuum electrodynamics as being a subsystem and to write the total
energy--momentum tensor as the sum of a Maxwellian electromagnetic subsystem
energy--momentum tensor and a phenomenological material subsystem
energy--momentum tensor. We prove that fundamental principles of physics are
violated by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics and that fundamental
principles of physics are violated by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics
supplemented by the material subsystem conjecture. We use field theory to
derive legitimate equations for macroscopic electromagnetic fields in a
transparent linear magneto-dielectric medium. The new field equations are a
part of a self-consistent formulation of macroscopic electrodynamics,
conservation laws, special relativity, and invariance in a continuous linear
medium. In the new formulation, the temporal and spatial coordinates are
renormalized by the continuous linear medium instead of the permittivity and
permeability being carried as independent material parameters. Then an
isotropic, homogeneous, flat, four-dimensional, continuous, linear,
non-Minkowski spacetime is the proper setting for the continuum electrodynamics
of a simple linear medium in which the effective speed of light is $c/n$ and
each medium will be associated with a different spacetime.
