The collected data though are usually low quality and contain inaccuracies and
errors. As a result, modern science and business face the problem of learning
from unreliable data sets.
  In this work, we provide a generic approach that is based on
\textit{verification} of only few records of the data set to guarantee high
quality learning outcomes for various optimization objectives. Our method,
identifies small sets of critical records and verifies their validity. We show
that many problems only need $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ verifications, to
ensure that the output of the computation is at most a factor of $(1 \pm
\varepsilon)$ away from the truth. For any given instance, we provide an
\textit{instance optimal} solution that verifies the minimum possible number of
records to approximately certify correctness. Then using this instance optimal
formulation of the problem we prove our main result: ""every function that
satisfies some Lipschitz continuity condition can be certified with a small
number of verifications"". We show that the required Lipschitz continuity
condition is satisfied even by some NP-complete problems, which illustrates the
generality and importance of this theorem.
  In case this certification step fails, an invalid record will be identified.
Removing these records and repeating until success, guarantees that the result
will be accurate and will depend only on the verified records. Surprisingly, as
we show, for several computation tasks more efficient methods are possible.
These methods always guarantee that the produced result is not affected by the
invalid records, since any invalid record that affects the output will be
detected and verified.

investigated. Full integrability is not considered, only the existence of an
infinite number of conserved quantities associated with a system containing a
defect. For defects in affine Toda field theories (ATFTs) it is shown that
momentum conservation is very likely to be a necessary condition for
integrability. The defect Lax matrices which guarantee zero curvature, and so
an infinite number of conserved quantities, are calculated for the momentum
conserving Tzitz\'eica defect and the momentum conserving $D_4$ ATFT defect.
Some additional calculations pertaining to the $D_4$ defect are also carried
out to find a more complete set of defect potentials than has appeared
previously.

continuous vector form. A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation
between a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random
hash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented
by $k$ $d$-dimensional embeddings vectors and one $k$ dimensional weight
vector. The final $d$ dimensional representation of the token is the product of
the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are
selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of $B$ embedding vectors. Our
experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies
consisting of millions of tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need
to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary
pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings
exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular
embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the number of parameters
needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular
embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the
hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding, hash
embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing
regular embedding types.

the true solution into discontinuous coarse-scale and discontinuous fine-scale
parts. The obtained coarse-scale weak formulation includes two types of
fine-scale contributions. The first type corresponds to a fine-scale volumetric
term, which we formulate in terms of a residual-based model that also takes
into account fine-scale effects at element interfaces. The second type consists
of independent fine-scale terms at element interfaces, which we formulate in
terms of a new fine-scale ""interface model"". We demonstrate for the
one-dimensional Poisson problem that existing discontinuous Galerkin
formulations, such as the interior penalty method, can be rederived by choosing
particular fine-scale interface models. The multiscale formulation thus opens
the door for a new perspective on discontinuous Galerkin methods and their
numerical properties. This is demonstrated for the one-dimensional
advection-diffusion problem, where we show that upwind numerical fluxes can be
interpreted as an ad hoc remedy for missing volumetric fine-scale terms.

Euclidean length in the configuration. A path is an ordered sequence of the
points, and a loop is a path that has the same endpoints. A path or loop, as a
sequence of edges, also has a Euclidean length. In this paper, we study the
question of when $\mathbf{p}$ will be uniquely determined (up to an unknowable
Euclidean transform) from a given set of path or loop lengths. In particular,
we consider the setting where the lengths are given simply as a set of real
numbers, and are not labeled with the combinatorial data describing the paths
or loops that gave rise to the lengths.
  Our main result is a condition on the set of paths or loops that is
sufficient to guarantee such a unique determination. We also provide an
algorithm, under a real computational model, for performing a reconstruction of
$\mathbf{p}$ from such unlabeled lengths.
  To obtain our results, we introduce a new family of algebraic varieties which
we call the unsquared measurement varieties. The family is parameterized by the
number of points $n$ and the dimension $d$, and our results follow from a
complete characterization of the linear automorphisms of these varieties for
all $n$ and $d$. The linear automorphisms for the special case of $n = 4$ and

achieving dimension reduction and improving parameter estimation efficiency.
While many envelope methods have been proposed in recent years, all envelope
methods hinge on the knowledge of a key hyperparameter, the structural
dimension of the envelope. How to estimate the envelope dimension consistently
is of substantial interest from both theoretical and practical aspects.
Moreover, very recent advances in the literature have generalized envelope as a
model-free method, which makes selecting the envelope dimension even more
challenging. Likelihood-based approaches such as information criteria and
likelihood-ratio tests either cannot be directly applied or have no theoretical
justification. To address this critical issue of dimension selection, we
propose two unified approaches -- called FG and 1D selections -- for
determining the envelope dimension that can be applied to any envelope models
and methods. The two model-free selection approaches are based on the two
different envelope optimization procedures: the full Grassmannian (FG)
optimization and the 1D algorithm (Cook and Zhang, 2016), and are shown to be
capable of correctly identifying the structural dimension with a probability
tending to 1 under mild moment conditions as the sample size increases. While
the FG selection unifies and generalizes the BIC and modified BIC approaches
that existing in the literature, and hence provides the theoretical
justification of them under weak moment condition and model-free context, the
1D selection is computationally more stable and efficient in finite sample.
Extensive simulations and a real data analysis demonstrate the superb
performance of our proposals.

study their individual roles and synergies in the success of an advertisement.
The objective of this work is then to measure the effectiveness of an
advertisement, and to recommend a useful set of features to advertisement
designers to make it more successful and approachable to users. Our proposed
framework employs the signal processing technique of cross modality feature
learning where data streams from different components are employed to train
separate neural network models and are then fused together to learn a shared
representation. Subsequently, a neural network model trained on this joint
feature embedding representation is utilized as a classifier to predict
advertisement effectiveness. We validate our approach using subjective ratings
from a dedicated user study, the sentiment strength of online viewer comments,
and a viewer opinion metric of the ratio of the Likes and Views received by
each advertisement from an online platform.

$p$ dominates another point $q$ if $p$ is as good as $q$ in all dimensions and
it is strictly better than $q$ in at least one dimension. In this work, we
focus on the static $2$-d space and provide expected performance guarantees for
$3$-sided Range Skyline Queries on the Grid, where $N$ is the cardinality of
$P$, $B$ the size of a disk block, and $R$ the capacity of main memory. We
present the MLR-tree, which offers optimal expected cost for finding planar
skyline points in a $3$-sided query rectangle, $q=[a,b]\times(-\infty,d]$, in
both RAM and I/O model on the grid $[1,M]\times [1,M]$, by single scanning only
the points contained in $SKY(P)$. In particular, it supports skyline queries in
a $3$-sided range in $O(t\cdot t_{PAM}(N))$ time ($O((t/B)\cdot t_{PAM}(N))$
I/Os), where $t$ is the answer size and $t_{PAM}(N)$ the time required for
answering predecessor queries for $d$ in a PAM (Predecessor Access Method)
structure, which is a special component of MLR-tree and stores efficiently
root-to-leaf paths or sub-paths. By choosing PAM structures with $O(1)$
expected time for predecessor queries under discrete $\mu$-random distributions
of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, MLR-tree supports skyline queries in optimal
$O(t)$ expected time ($O(t/B)$ expected number of I/Os) with high probability.
The space cost becomes superlinear and can be reduced to linear for many
special practical cases. If we choose a PAM structure with $O(1)$ amortized
time for batched predecessor queries (under no assumption on distributions of
the $x$ and $y$ coordinates), MLR-tree supports batched skyline queries in
optimal $O(t)$ amortized time, however the space becomes exponential. In
dynamic case, the update time complexity is affected by a $O(log^{2}N)$ factor.

article, we present image reconstruction results from highly reduced
radio-interferometric data, following our previously proposed data
dimensionality reduction method, $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{sing}}$, based on
studying the distribution of the singular values of the measurement operator.
This method comprises a simple weighted, subsampled discrete Fourier transform
of the dirty image. Additionally, we show that an alternative gridding-based
reduction method works well for target data sizes of the same order as the
image size. We reconstruct images from well-calibrated VLA data to showcase the
robustness of our proposed method down to very low data sizes in a 'real data'
setting. We show through comparisons with the conventional reduction method of
time- and frequency-averaging, that our proposed method produces more accurate
reconstructions while reducing data size much further, and is particularly
robust when data sizes are aggressively reduced to low fractions of the image
size. $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{sing}}$ can function in a block-wise fashion, and
could be used in the future to process incoming data by blocks in real-time,
thus opening up the possibility of performing 'on-line' imaging as the data are
being acquired. MATLAB code for the proposed dimensionality reduction method is

can provide critical information on stellar phenomena such as rotational
deformation, accretion effects, and the universality of starspot (sunspot)
cycles. Achieving this level of resolution in optical wavelength bands (U/V)
requires use of a sparse array of interferometric telescopes with kilometer
scale baseline separations. Current ground based VHE gamma-ray observatories,
such as VERITAS, HESS, and MAGIC, employ arrays of > 10 m diameter optical
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) with >80 m telescope
separations, and are therefore well suited for sub-milliarcsecond astronomical
imaging in the U/V bands using Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry
[1,2]. We describe the development of instrumentation for the augmentation of
IACT arrays to perform Stellar Intensity Interferometric (SII) imaging.
Laboratory tests are performed using pseudo-random and thermal (blackbody)
light to demonstrate the ability of high speed (250 MHz) digitizing electronics
to continuously record photon intensity over long periods (minutes to hours)
and validate the use of offline software correlation to calculate the squared
degree of coherence . We then use as the interferometric observable to populate
the Fourier reciporical image plane, and apply standard inversion techniques to
recover the original 2-D source image. The commercial availability of
inexpensive fiber-optic based sub-nanosecond multi-crate (White Rabbit[3])
synchronization timing enables the extension of SII to baselines greater than
10 km, theoretically allowing U/V band imaging with resolution <100 $\mu$
arc-seconds. This article provides a description of typical designs of
practical SII instrumentation for the VERITAS IACT observatory array (Amado,
Arizona) and the future CTA IACT Observatory (Canary Islands, Spain and
Paranal, Chile).

simulation of high-harmonic emission in polyatomic molecules without invoking
reduced-dimensionality models for the nuclear motion or the electronic

generation (HHG) spectroscopy of methane. The HHG emission in this molecule
transiently involves strongly vibronically-coupled $^2F_2$ electronic state of
the $\rm CH_4^+$ cation. We show that the isotopic HHG ratio in methane
contains signatures of: a) field-free vibronic dynamics at the conical
intersection (CI); b) resonant features in the recombination cross-sections; c)
laser-driven bound-state dynamics; as well as d) the well-known short-time
Gaussian decay of the emission. We assign the intrinsic vibronic feature (a) to
a relatively long-lived ($\ge4$ fs) vibronic wave packet of the singly-excited
$\nu_4$ ($t_2$) and $\nu_2$ ($e$) vibrational modes, strongly coupled to the
components of the $^2F_2$ electronic state. We demonstrate that these physical

paper examines the cyclic shift graphs of `plactic-like' monoids, whose
elements can be viewed as combinatorial objects of some type: aside from the
plactic monoid itself (the monoid of Young tableaux), examples include the
hypoplactic monoid (quasi-ribbon tableaux), the sylvester monoid (binary search
trees), the stalactic monoid (stalactic tableaux), the taiga monoid (binary
search trees with multiplicities), and the Baxter monoid (pairs of twin binary
search trees). It was already known that for many of these monoids, connected
components of the cyclic shift graph consist of elements that have the same
evaluation (that is, contain the same number of each generating symbol). This
paper focusses on the maximum diameter of a connected component of the cyclic
shift graph of these monoids in the rank-$n$ case. For the hypoplactic monoid,
this is $n-1$; for the sylvester and taiga monoids, at least $n-1$ and at most
$n$; for the stalactic monoid, $3$ (except for ranks $1$ and $2$, when it is
respectively $0$ and $1$); for the plactic monoid, at least $n-1$ and at most
$2n-3$. The current state of knowledge, including new and previously-known
results, is summarized in a table.

and momentum of the electron are locked, have lately become an important field
of its own. When coupled to a conventional superconductor, such systems are
expected to manifest topological superconductivity, a unique phase that gives
rise to exotic Majorana zero modes. Even more interesting are fractional
helical states which have not been observed before and which open the route for
the realization of the generalized para fermions quasiparticles. Possessing non
abelian exchange statistics, these quasiparticles may serve as building blocks
in topological quantum computing. Here, we present a new approach to form
protected one dimensional helical and fractional helical edge modes in the
quantum Hall regime. The novel platform is based on a carefully designed double
quantum well structure in a high mobility GaAs based system. In turn, the
quantum well hosts two sub bands of 2D electrons, each tuned to the quantum
Hall effect regime. By electrostatic gating of different areas of the
structure, counter propagating integer, as well as fractional, edge modes,
belonging to Landau levels with opposite spins are formed, rendering the modes
helical. We demonstrate that due to spin protection, these helical modes remain
ballistic, without observed mixing for large distances. In addition to the
formation of helical modes, this new platform can be exploited as a rich
playground for an artificial induction of compounded fractional edge modes, as
well as construction of interferometers based on chiral edge modes.

superposition of two single-star spectra. Even without a detectable velocity
offset between the two stellar components, the combined spectrum of a binary
system is in general different from that of either component, and fitting it
with single-star models may yield inaccurate stellar parameters and abundances.
We perform simple experiments with synthetic spectra to investigate the effect
of unresolved main-sequence binaries on spectral fitting, modeling spectra
similar to those collected by the APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST surveys. We find
that fitting unresolved binaries with single-star models introduces systematic
biases in the derived stellar parameters and abundances that are modest but
certainly not negligible, with typical systematic errors of $300\,\rm K$ in
$T_{\rm eff}$, 0.1 dex in $\log g$, and 0.1 dex in $[\rm Fe/H]$ for APOGEE-like
spectra of solar-type stars. These biases are smaller for spectra at optical
wavelengths than in the near-infrared. We show that biases can be corrected by
fitting spectra with a binary model, which adds only two labels to the fit and
includes single-star models as a special case. Our model provides a promising
new method to constrain the Galactic binary population, including systems with
single-epoch spectra and no detectable velocity offset between the two stars.

ubiquitous superconducting order that is both non-local and odd in time. It
appears under quite general circumstances including in bulk materials,
heterostructures and dynamically driven superconducting states. It is therefore
important to understand the nature of odd-w pairing. We present the properties
of odd-w pairing in bulk materials, including possible microscopic mechanisms,
discuss definitions of the odd-w superconducting order parameter, and the
unusual Meissner response of odd-frequency superconductors. Next, we present
how odd-w pairing is generated in hybrid structures of nearly any sort and
focus on its relation to Andreev bound states, spin polarized Cooper pairs, and
Majorana states. We overview how odd-w pairing can be applied to
non-superconducting systems such as ultracold Fermi gases, Bose-Einstein

outflows from supernovae or AGN feedback. The average Lyman-alpha (Ly-a)
absorption profile around galactic halos represents a powerful tool to probe
their gaseous environments. We compare predictions from Illustris and Nyx
hydrodynamical simulations with the observed absorption around foreground
quasars, damped Ly-a systems, and Lyman-break galaxies. We show how large-scale
BOSS and small-scale quasar pair measurements can be combined to precisely
constrain the absorption profile over three decades in transverse distance
20kpc$\lesssim b\lesssim$20Mpc. Far from galaxies $\gtrsim2$Mpc, the
simulations converge to the same profile and provide a reasonable match to the
observations. This asymptotic agreement arises because the $\Lambda$CDM model
successfully describes the ambient IGM, and represents a critical advantage of
studying the mean absorption profile. However, significant differences between
the simulations, and between simulations and observations are present on scales
20kpc$\lesssim b\lesssim$2Mpc, illustrating the challenges of accurately
modeling and resolving galaxy formation physics. It is noteworthy that these
differences are observed as far out as $\sim2$Mpc, indicating that the
`sphere-of-influence' of galaxies could extend to approximately $\sim7$ times
the halo virial radius ($\sim100$kpc). Current observations are very precise on
these scales and can thus strongly discriminate between different galaxy
formation models. We demonstrate that the Ly-a absorption profile is primarily
sensitive to the underlying temperature-density relationship of diffuse gas
around galaxies, and argue that it thus provides a fundamental test of galaxy
formation models.

(EWs) of CIII]1909, CIV1549 and the line ratios of CIII], CIV, and HeII1640
recombination lines. We apply these diagnostics to a sample of 450

well described by stellar photoionization from single and binary stars. The
inferred metallicity and ionization parameter is typically Z=0.3-0.5Zsun and
logU=-2.7 to -3, in agreement with earlier works at similar redshifts. The
models also indicate an average age of 50-200Myr since the beginning of the
current star-formation, and an ionizing photon production rate, xi_ion, of
log(xi_ion/[Hz/erg])~25.3-25.4. Among the sources with EW(CIII])=10-20A, ~30%
are likely dominated by AGNs. Their derived metallicity is low, Z=0.02-0.2Zsun,
and the ionization parameter higher (logU=-1.7). To explain the average UV
observations of the strongest but rarest CIII] emitters (EW(CIII])>20A), we
find that stellar photoionization is clearly insufficient. A radiation field
consisting of a mix of a young stellar population (log(xi_ion/[Hz/erg])~25.7)
plus an AGN component is required. Furthermore an enhanced C/O abundance ratio
is needed for metallicities Z=0.1-0.2Zsun and logU=-1.7 to -1.5. Conclusions:
The UV diagnostics we propose should serve as an important basis for the
interpretation of observations of high-redshift galaxies. [abridged]

resulting dynamical friction modifies the binary's orbit. We study this effect
for the double disk dark matter (DDDM) scenario, where a fraction of the dark
matter is dissipative and settles into a thin disk. For binaries within the
dark disk, this effect is enhanced due to the higher dark matter density and
lower velocity dispersion of the dark disk, and due to its co-rotation with the
baryonic disk.We estimate the effect and compare it with observations for two
different limits in the Knudsen number ($Kn$). First, in the case where DDDM is
effectively collisionless within the characteristic scale of the binary
($Kn\gg1$) and ignoring the possible interaction between the pair of dark
matter wakes. Second, in the fully collisional case ($Kn\ll1$), where a fluid
description can be adopted and the interaction of the pair of wakes is taken
into account. We find that the change in the orbital period is of the same
order of magnitude in both limits. A comparison with observations reveals good
prospects to probe currently allowed DDDM models with timing data from binary
pulsars in the near future. We finally comment on the possibility of extending

4 distinct position angles, totaling 34 orbits with the G141 grism, although
only 19 of the orbits are relatively uncontaminated along the trace of
MACS1149-JD. We fit a 3-parameter ($z$, F160W mag, and Ly$\alpha$ equivalent
width) Lyman-break galaxy template to the three least contaminated grism
position angles using an MCMC approach. The grism data alone are best fit with
a redshift of $z_{\mathrm{grism}}=9.53^{+0.39}_{-0.60}$ ($68\%$ confidence), in
good agreement with our photometric estimate of
$z_{\mathrm{phot}}=9.51^{+0.06}_{-0.12}$ ($68\%$ confidence). Our analysis
rules out Lyman-alpha emission from MACS1149-JD above a $3\sigma$ equivalent
width of 21 \AA{}, consistent with a highly neutral IGM. We explore a scenario
where the red $\textit{Spitzer}$/IRAC $[3.6] - [4.5]$ color of the galaxy
previously pointed out in the literature is due to strong rest-frame optical
emission lines from a very young stellar population rather than a 4000 \AA{}
break. We find that while this can provide an explanation for the observed IRAC
color, it requires a lower redshift ($z\lesssim9.1$), which is less preferred
by the $\textit{HST}$ imaging data. The grism data are consistent with both
scenarios, indicating that the red IRAC color can still be explained by a 4000
\AA{} break, characteristic of a relatively evolved stellar population. In this
interpretation, the photometry indicate that a $340^{+29}_{-35}$ Myr stellar

we construct a model that simultaneously takes into account the radiative

traces the inner molecular disk ($r\approx 0.5 \,\rm{kpc}$) of Alth{\ae}a with
the peak of the CO surface brightness co-located with that of the [CII] 158$\rm

to that observed in local galaxies with similar stellar mass. The high

Alth{\ae}a, its large Mach number (\mach$\approx 30$), and the warm kinetic

CO(7-6) transition, i.e. at relatively high-$J$, and a CO-to-$\rm H_2$

data for 36 MYSOs drawn from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey. This is the
largest sample observed at this resolution at these wavelengths of MYSOs to
date. The spectra are characterized mostly by emission from hydrogen
recombination lines and accretion diagnostic lines. One MYSO shows photospheric
HI absorption, a comparison with spectral standards indicates that the star is
an A type star with a low surface gravity, implying that the MYSOs are probably
swollen, as also suggested by evolutionary calculations. An investigation of
the Br$\gamma$ line profiles shows that most are in pure emission, while
13$\pm$5 % display P Cygni profiles, indicative of outflow, while less than
8$\pm$4 % have inverse P Cygni profiles, indicative of infall. These values are
comparable with investigations into the optically bright Herbig Be stars, but
not with those of Herbig Ae and T Tauri stars, consistent with the notion that
the more massive stars undergo accretion in a different fashion than lower mass
objects which are undergoing magnetospheric accretion. Accretion luminosities
and rates as derived from the Br$\gamma$ line luminosities agree with results
for lower mass sources, providing tentative evidence for massive star formation
theories based on scaling of low-mass scenarios. We present Br$\gamma$/Br12
line profile ratios exploiting the fact that optical depth effects can be
traced as a function of Doppler shift across the lines. These show that the
winds of MYSOs in this sample are nearly equally split between constant,
accelerating, and decelerating velocity structures. There are no trends between
the types of features we see and bolometric luminosities or near-infrared

nuclei, standard models of neutrino-heated winds from proto-neutron stars
(PNSs) do not reach the requisite neutron-to-seed ratio for production of the
lanthanides and actinides. However, the abundance distribution created by the
r-, rp-, or $\nu p$-processes in PNS winds depends sensitively on the entropy
and dynamical expansion timescale of the flow, which may be strongly affected
by high magnetic fields. Here, we present results from magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of non-rotating neutrino-heated PNS winds with strong dipole
magnetic fields from $10^{14}-10^{16}$ G, and assess their role in altering the
conditions for nucleosynthesis. The strong field forms a closed zone and helmet
streamer configuration at the equator, with episodic dynamical mass ejections
in toroidal plasmoids. We find dramatically enhanced entropy in these regions
and conditions favorable for third-peak r-process nucleosynthesis if the wind
is neutron-rich. If instead the wind is proton-rich, the conditions will affect
the abundances from the $\nu p$-process. We quantify the distribution of
ejected matter in entropy and dynamical expansion timescale, and the critical
magnetic field strength required to affect the entropy. For $B\gtrsim10^{15}$
G, we find that $\gtrsim10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and up to $\sim10^{-5}$
M$_{\odot}$ of high entropy material is ejected per highly-magnetized neutron
star birth in the wind phase, providing a mechanism for prompt heavy element
enrichment of the universe. Former binary companions identified within
(magnetar-hosting) supernova remnants, the remnants themselves, and runaway
stars may exhibit overabundances. We provide a comparison with a semi-analytic

a different gas-phase. Most importantly, 85% (50%) of these absorbers show a
metallicity of $\rm [Si/H] > -1.0$ (0.0). The fraction of systems showing high

galaxy-overdensity around these weak absorbers compared to random places with a
median impact parameter of 166 kpc to the nearest galaxy. Moreover, we find the
presence of multiple galaxies in $\sim80$% of the cases, suggesting group
environments. The observed $d\mathcal{N}/dz$ of $0.8\pm0.2$ indicates that such
metal-enriched, compact, dense structures are ubiquitous in the halos of

dimension. In two dimensions, this $C^1$ result has been improved to
$C^{1,\alpha}$ by Weiss \cite{W99}.
  In this paper we prove that, for $n=2$ singular points are locally contained

holds with $C^{1,1}$ manifolds (or with countably many $C^2$ manifolds), up to

AdaUCB achieves $O(1)$ regret with respect to $T$ if the exploration cost is

propose the Speaker Interaction Recurrent Neural Network (SI-RNN). Whereas the
previous state-of-the-art system updated speaker embeddings only for the
sender, SI-RNN uses a novel dialog encoder to update speaker embeddings in a
role-sensitive way. Additionally, unlike the previous work that selected the
addressee and response separately, SI-RNN selects them jointly by viewing the
task as a sequence prediction problem. Experimental results show that SI-RNN
significantly improves the accuracy of addressee and response selection,
particularly in complex conversations with many speakers and responses to

reaction codes such as TALYS and EMPIRE populate a wide range of states in the
residual nucleus prior to $\gamma$-ray decay, but do not go beyond the use of
deterministic functions and therefore neglect cascade fluctuations. This

This positivity condition naturally leads to the study of the sub-Hardy Hilbert
spaces of the bidisk, which are analogs of de Branges-Rovnyak spaces on the
unit disk. We discuss multipliers of those spaces and obtain some classes of
bounded composition operators on the bidisk.

with average values $\gtrsim0.01$. For individual cores of similar age, we
observe the deuteration fraction to increase with time, but also to be
independent of their average properties such as density, virial or
mass-to-magnetic flux ratio. We further find a correlation of the deuteration
fraction with core mass, average H$_2$ density and virial parameter only at
late evolutionary stages of the filament and attribute this to the lifetime of
the individual cores. Specifically, chemically old cores reveal higher
deuteration fractions. Within the radial profiles of selected cores, we notice
differences in the structure of the deuteration fraction or surface density,
which we can attribute to their different turbulent properties. High
deuteration fractions of the order $0.01-0.1$ may be reached within
approximately $200$~kyrs, corresponding to two free-fall times, as defined for

information token spreads in the network. Since users in real-world networks
vary significantly in their intensity and periods of activity, our objective in
this work is to answer: How to determine a temporal scale that best agrees with
the observed information propagation within a network? A key limitation of
existing approaches is that they aggregate the timeline into fixed-size
windows, which may not fit all network nodes' activity periods. We propose the
notion of a heterogeneous network clock: a mapping of events to discrete
timestamps that best explains their occurrence according to a given cascade
propagation model. We focus on the widely-adopted independent cascade (IC)
model and formalize the optimal clock as the one that maximizes the likelihood
of all observed cascades. The single optimal clock (OC) problem can be solved
exactly in polynomial time. However, we prove that learning multiple optimal
clocks(kOC), corresponding to temporal patterns of groups of network nodes, is
NP-hard. We propose scalable solutions that run in almost linear time in the
total number of cascade activations and discuss approximation guarantees for
each variant. Our algorithms and their detected clocks enable improved cascade
size classification (up to 8 percent F1 lift) and improved missing cascade data
inference (0.15 better recall). We also demonstrate that the network clocks
exhibit consistency within the type of content diffusing in the network and are
robust with respect to the propagation probability parameters of the IC model.

has previously suggested it as an intermediate-age, moderately metal-rich
system, although the exact values for its age and metallicity remained
ambiguous in the literature. We measured detailed chemical abundances of 14
elements in four red giant members, from high-resolution (R=25000) spectra that
firmly establish Gaia 1 as an object associated with the thick disk. The
resulting mean Fe abundance is $-0.62\pm$0.03(stat.)$\pm$0.10(sys.) dex, which
is more metal-poor than indicated by previous spectroscopy from the literature,
but it is fully in line with values from isochrone fitting. We find that Gaia 1
is moderately enhanced in the $\alpha$-elements, which allowed us to
consolidate its membership with the thick disk via chemical tagging. The
cluster's Fe-peak and neutron-capture elements are similar to those found
across the metal-rich disks, where the latter indicate some level of
$s$-process activity. No significant spread in iron nor in other heavy elements
was detected, whereas we find evidence of light-element variations in Na, Mg,
and Al. Nonetheless, the traditional Na-O and Mg-Al (anti-)correlations,
typically seen in old globular clusters, are not seen in our data. This
confirms that Gaia 1 is rather a massive and luminous open cluster than a
low-mass globular cluster. Finally, orbital computations of the target stars
bolster our chemical findings of Gaia 1's present-day membership with the thick
disk, even though it remains unclear, which mechanisms put it in that place.

entangling interactions between the cavities can be varied on demand, forming
the basis for logic operations on the two modes. Finally, we discuss the
feasibility of producing an array of cavities and qubits where intermediary and

Psiphon, and Lantern is to secretly share the IP addresses of circumvention

instance, such secretly shared proxies are known as bridges in Tor. However, a
key challenge to this mechanism is the insider attack problem: censoring agents
can impersonate as benign censored clients in order to obtain (and then block)
such secretly shared circumvention proxies.
  In this paper, we perform a fundamental study on the problem of insider
attack on proxy-based circumvention systems. We model the proxy distribution
problem using game theory, based on which we derive the optimal strategies of
the parties involved, i.e., the censors and circumvention system operators.
  That is, we derive the optimal proxy distribution mechanism of a
circumvention system like Tor, against the censorship adversary who also takes
his optimal censorship strategies.
  This is unlike previous works that design ad hoc mechanisms for proxy
distribution, against non-optimal censors.
  We perform extensive simulations to evaluate our optimal proxy assignment
algorithm under various adversarial and network settings. Comparing with the
state-of-the-art prior work, we show that our optimal proxy assignment
algorithm has superior performance, i.e., better resistance to censorship even

conclude with lessons and recommendation for the design of proxy-based

treatment to a broader class of gravitational theories. Here we consider the
case of the Einstein-Cartan theory as a prototype of theories with
non-propagating torsion. In doing so, we study the properties of Killing
horizons in the presence of torsion, establish the notion of local causal
horizon in Riemann-Cartan spacetimes, and derive the generalised Raychaudhuri
equation for this kind of geometries. Then, starting with the entropy that can
be associated to these local causal horizons, we derive the Einstein-Cartan
equation by implementing the Clausius equation. We outline two ways of
proceeding with the derivation depending on whether we take torsion as a
geometric field or as a matter field. In both cases we need to add internal
entropy production terms to the Clausius equation as the shear and twist cannot
be taken to be zero a priori for our setup. This fact implies the necessity of
a non-equilibrium thermodynamics treatment for the local causal horizon.
Furthermore, it implies that a non-zero twist at the horizon will in general

high internal and low external interactions? To address this question we
generalize traditional local community detection in graphs to the setting of
dynamic networks. Adopting existing static-network approaches in an
""aggregated"" graph of all temporal interactions is not appropriate for the
problem as dynamic communities may be short-lived and thus lost when mixing
interactions over long periods. Hence, dynamic community mining requires the
detection of both the community nodes and an optimal time interval in which
they are actively interacting.
  We propose a filter-and-verify framework for dynamic community detection. To
scale to long intervals of graph evolution, we employ novel spectral bounds for
dynamic community conductance and employ them to filter suboptimal periods in
near-linear time. We also design a time-and-graph-aware locality sensitive
hashing family to effectively spot promising community cores. Our method PHASR
discovers communities of consistently higher quality (2 to 67 times better)
than those of baselines. At the same time, our bounds allow for pruning between
$55\%$ and $95\%$ of the search space, resulting in significant savings in
running time compared to exhaustive alternatives for even modest time intervals
of graph evolution.

random variables and random branching. The most basic liveness property for
such programs is the termination property. The qualitative (aka almost-sure)
termination problem given a probabilistic program asks whether the program
terminates with probability 1. While ranking functions provide a sound and
complete method for non-probabilistic programs, the extension of them to
probabilistic programs is achieved via ranking supermartingales (RSMs). While
deep theoretical results have been established about RSMs, their application to
probabilistic programs with nondeterminism has been limited only to academic
examples. For non-probabilistic programs, lexicographic ranking functions
provide a compositional and practical approach for termination analysis of
real-world programs. In this work we introduce lexicographic RSMs and show that
they present a sound method for almost-sure termination of probabilistic
programs with nondeterminism. We show that lexicographic RSMs provide a tool
for compositional reasoning about almost sure termination, and for
probabilistic programs with linear arithmetic they can be synthesized
efficiently (in polynomial time). We also show that with additional
restrictions even asymptotic bounds on expected termination time can be
obtained through lexicographic RSMs. Finally, we present experimental results
on abstractions of real-world programs to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

smaller pieces, the generating functions of which are encoded in a commuting
set of Hilbert space operators. The general enumeration problem is then solved
by obtaining an explicit eigenvalue decomposition of these operators involving
elliptic functions. By further restricting the intermediate winding angles of
the walks to some open interval, the method can be used to count various
classes of walks restricted to cones in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of opening angles that
are integer multiples of $\pi/4$.
  We present three applications of this main result. First we find an explicit
generating function for the walks in such cones that start and end at the

directly related to Gessel's walks in the quadrant, and we provide a new proof

simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ around a point in the close vicinity of
its starting point, for which we identify discrete analogues of the known
hyperbolic secant laws and a probabilistic interpretation of the Jacobi
elliptic functions. Finally we relate the spectrum of one of the Hilbert space

addresses two common problems: 1) computing a sum given arbitrary filter
conditions and 2) identifying the frequent items or heavy hitters in a data
set. For the former, the sketch provides unbiased estimates with state of the
art accuracy. It handles the challenging scenario when the data is
disaggregated so that computing the per unit metric of interest requires an
expensive aggregation. For example, the metric of interest may be total clicks
per user while the raw data is a click stream with multiple rows per user. Thus
the sketch is suitable for use in a wide range of applications including
computing historical click through rates for ad prediction, reporting user
metrics from event streams, and measuring network traffic for IP flows.
  We prove and empirically show the sketch has good properties for both the
disaggregated subset sum estimation and frequent item problems. On i.i.d. data,
it not only picks out the frequent items but gives strongly consistent
estimates for the proportion of each frequent item. The resulting sketch
asymptotically draws a probability proportional to size sample that is optimal
for estimating sums over the data. For non i.i.d. data, we show that it
typically does much better than random sampling for the frequent item problem
and never does worse. For subset sum estimation, we show that even for
pathological sequences, the variance is close to that of an optimal sampling
design. Empirically, despite the disadvantage of operating on disaggregated
data, our method matches or bests priority sampling, a state of the art method
for pre-aggregated data and performs orders of magnitude better on skewed data
compared to uniform sampling. We propose extensions to the sketch that allow it
to be used in combining multiple data sets, in distributed systems, and for

before financial crisis period (period-I), during recession (period-II), after

that both the Indian and Chinese stock markets do not exhibit weak form of

distinct from that in thicker medium due to the profoundly different atomic

learning (RL), where the aim is to compute an appropriate $\theta_{*} \in
\mathbb{R}^d$ (that is an optimum or a fixed point) using noisy data and $O(d)$
updates per iteration. In this paper, we are motivated by the problem (in RL)
of policy evaluation from experience replay using the \emph{temporal
difference} (TD) class of learning algorithms that are also LSAs. For LSAs with
a constant step-size, and PR averaging, we provide bounds for the mean squared
error (MSE) after $t$ iterations. We assume that data is \iid with finite
variance (underlying distribution being $P$) and that the expected dynamics is
Hurwitz. For a given LSA with PR averaging, and data distribution $P$
satisfying the said assumptions, we show that there exists a range of constant
step-sizes such that its MSE decays as $O(\frac{1}{t})$.
  We examine the conditions under which a constant step-size can be chosen
uniformly for a class of data distributions $\mathcal{P}$, and show that not
all data distributions `admit' such a uniform constant step-size. We also

quantum master equation for the calculation of linear and nonlinear
spectroscopies of multichromophore systems. We show that, even for systems with
non-adiabatic coupling, the TCL2 master equation predicts linear absorption
spectra that are accurate over an extremely broad range of parameters and well
beyond what would be expected based on the perturbative nature of the approach;
non-equilibrium population dynamics calculated with TCL2 for identical
parameters are significantly less accurate. For third-order (two-dimensional)
spectroscopy, the importance of population dynamics and the violation of the
so-called quantum regression theorem degrade the accuracy of TCL2 dynamics. To
correct these failures, we combine the TCL2 approach with a classical ensemble
sampling of slow microscopic bath degrees of freedom, leading to an efficient
hybrid quantum-classical scheme that displays excellent accuracy over a wide
range of parameters. In the spectroscopic setting, the success of such a hybrid
scheme can be understood through its separate treatment of homogeneous and
inhomogeneous broadening. Importantly, the presented approach has the
computational scaling of TCL2, with the modest addition of an embarrassingly
parallel prefactor associated with ensemble sampling. The presented approach
can be understood as a generalized inhomogeneous cumulant expansion technique,
capable of treating multilevel systems with non-adiabatic dynamics.

complex sequential tasks by using a deep neural network as its function

images is that deep RL must learn the state feature representation from the raw
images in addition to learning a policy. As a result, deep RL can require a
prohibitively large amount of training time and data to reach reasonable
performance, making it difficult to use deep RL in real-world applications,
especially when data is expensive. In this work, we speed up training by
addressing half of what deep RL is trying to solve --- learning features. Our
approach is to learn some of the important features by pre-training deep RL
network's hidden layers via supervised learning using a small set of human
demonstrations. We empirically evaluate our approach using deep Q-network (DQN)
and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithms on the Atari 2600

with human demonstrations in a supervised learning manner is better at
discovering features relative to pre-training naively in DQN, and 2)
initializing a deep RL network with a pre-trained model provides a significant
improvement in training time even when pre-training from a small number of

propose that the abnormally low C2H2 OPR could be a remnant from an earlier,
colder phase, before the density enhancement (now the hot core) was impacted by
shocks generated from an explosive event 500 yrs ago.

previous studies often fail to properly incorporate priors tailored to
neuroscience, such as preferring shorter connections. To remedy this problem,
the paper here introduces a novel, weighted-$\ell_1$, multi-task graphical

with a parallelizable formulation. Additionally, W-SIMULE extends the
often-used Gaussian assumption, leading to considerable performance increases.
Here, applications to fMRI data show that W-SIMULE succeeds in determining
functional connectivity in terms of (1) log-likelihood, (2) finding edges that
differentiate groups, and (3) classifying different groups based on their
connectivity, achieving 58.6\% accuracy on the ABIDE dataset. Having
established W-SIMULE's effectiveness, it links four key areas to autism, all of
which are consistent with the literature. Due to its elegant domain adaptivity,
W-SIMULE can be readily applied to various data types to effectively estimate

design objective is to maximize the expected weighted sum-rate. By combining
the minorize-maximize (MM) algorithm with the deterministic equivalent method,

low-complexity algorithms are then derived. One for the general case, and the
other for the case when all the channel means are zeros. For the later case, it
is proved that the beam domain transmission is optimal, and thus the precoder
design reduces to the power allocation optimization in the beam domain.
Simulation results show that the proposed robust linear precoder designs apply

how to retain metastably hydrogenous materials made at high pressure P on

at finite temperatures T in the fluid. The term metallic here means quantum
mechanically degenerate. A single sample of ultracondensed hydrogen has been
made at an estimated pressure of 495 GPa at 5.5 K. Whether that sample is solid
or fluid remains to be determined. Those results imply the long quest for
metallic hydrogen is likely to be concluded in the relatively near future.
Because the quest for metallic hydrogen has been a major driver of high
pressure research for decades, a logical question is whether another research
direction, comparable in scale to that quest, will arise in high pressure
research in the future.
  One possibility is retention of metastable solid metallic hydrogen and other
hydrogenous materials on release of P and T to ambient. If hydrogenous
materials could be retained metastably in the solid on release, those materials
would be a new class of materials for scientific investigations and
technological applications. This paper is a brief review of the synthesis of

or not, etc.) in order to improve its recommendations. There are many possible
strategies for query auto-completion and a challenge is to design one optimal
engine that considers and uses all available information. When different
strategies are used to produce the suggestions, it becomes hard to rank these
heterogeneous suggestions. An alternative strategy could be to aggregate
several engines in order to enhance the diversity of recommendations by
combining the capacity of each engine to digest available information
differently, while keeping the simplicity of each engine. The main objective of
this research is therefore to find such mixture of query completion engines
that would beat any engine taken alone. We tackle this problem under the
bandits setting and evaluate four strategies to overcome this challenge.
Experiments conducted on three real datasets show that a mixture of engines can
outperform a single engine.

first variable found during our dedicated JCMT/SCUBA-2 monitoring program of
eight nearby star-forming regions. EC 53 remained quiescent for the first 6
months of our survey, from February to August 2016. The sub-mm emission began
to brighten in September 2016, reached a peak brightness of $1.5$ times the
faint state, and has been decaying slowly since February 2017. The change in
sub-mm brightness is interpreted as dust heating in the envelope, generated by
a luminosity increase of the protostar of a factor of $\ge 4$. The 850~$\mu$m
lightcurve resembles the historical $K$-band lightcurve, which varies by a
factor of $\sim 6$ with a 543 period and is interpreted as accretion
variability excited by interactions between the accretion disk and a close
binary system. The predictable detections of accretion variability observed at
both near-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths make the system a unique test-bed,
enabling us to capture the moment of the accretion burst and to study the
consequences of the outburst on the protostellar disk and envelope.

such magnetic white dwarfs known is now some hundreds. Fields range in strength
from a few kG to several hundred MG. Almost all the known magnetic white dwarfs
have a mean field modulus >= 1 MG. We are trying to fill a major gap in
observational knowledge at the low field limit (<= 200 kG) using circular
spectro-polarimetry.
  In this paper we report the discovery and monitoring of strong, periodic
magnetic variability in two previously discovered ""super-weak field"" magnetic
white dwarfs, WD2047+372 and WD2359-434. WD2047+372 has a mean longitudinal
field that reverses between about -12 and +15 kG, with a period of 0.243 d,
while its mean field modulus appears nearly constant at 60 kG. The observations
can be intepreted in terms of a dipolar field tilted with respect to the
stellar rotation axis. WD2359-434 always shows a weak positive longitudinal
field with values between about 0 and +12 kG, varying only weakly with stellar
rotation, while the mean field modulus varies between about 50 and 100 kG. The
rotation period is found to be 0.112 d using the variable shape of the Halpha
line core, consistent with available photometry. The field of this star appears
to be much more complex than a dipole, and is probably not axisymmetric.
  Available photometry shows that WD2359-434 is a light variable with an
amplitude of only 0.005 mag, our own photometry shows that if WD2047+372 is
photometrically variable, the amplitude is below about 0.01 mag.
  These are the first models for magnetic white dwarfs with fields below about
100 kG based on magnetic measurements through the full stellar rotation. They
reveal two very different magnetic surface configurations, and that, contrary
to simple ohmic decay theory, WD2359-434 has a much more complex surface field
than the much younger WD2047+372.

exponentially distributed, and independent processing times arrive as a Poisson
process of rate $\lambda n$, with $0<\lambda<1$, and are immediately dispatched
by a centralized dispatcher to one of $n$ First-In-First-Out queues associated
with $n$ identical servers. The dispatcher is endowed with a finite memory, and
with the ability to exchange messages with the servers.
  We propose and study a resource-constrained ""pull-based"" dispatching policy
that involves two parameters: (i) the number of memory bits available at the
dispatcher, and (ii) the average rate at which servers communicate with the
dispatcher. We establish (using a fluid limit approach) that the asymptotic, as
$n\to\infty$, expected queueing delay is zero when either (i) the number of
memory bits grows logarithmically with $n$ and the message rate grows
superlinearly with $n$, or (ii) the number of memory bits grows
superlogarithmically with $n$ and the message rate is at least $\lambda n$.
Furthermore, when the number of memory bits grows only logarithmically with $n$
and the message rate is proportional to $n$, we obtain a closed-form expression
for the (now positive) asymptotic delay.
  Finally, we demonstrate an interesting phase transition in the
resource-constrained regime where the asymptotic delay is non-zero. In
particular, we show that for any given $\alpha>0$ (no matter how small), if our
policy only uses a linear message rate $\alpha n$, the resulting asymptotic
delay is upper bounded, uniformly over all $\lambda<1$; this is in sharp
contrast to the delay obtained when no messages are used ($\alpha = 0$), which
grows as $1/(1-\lambda)$ when $\lambda\uparrow 1$, or when the popular
power-of-$d$-choices is used, in which the delay grows as

coordinates. In the narrow wedge case, when one endpoint of such polymers is
fixed, say at $(0,0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, and the other is varied horizontally,
over $(z,1)$, $z \in \mathbb{R}$, the polymer weight profile as a function of
$z \in \mathbb{R}$ is locally Brownian; indeed, by Theorem $2.11$ and
Proposition $2.5$ of [Ham16], the law of the profile is known to enjoy a very
strong comparison to Brownian bridge on a given compact interval, with a
Radon-Nikodym derivative in every $L^p$ space for $p \in (1,\infty)$, uniformly
in the scaling parameter, provided that an affine adjustment is made to the
weight profile before the comparison is made. In this article, we generalize
this narrow wedge case and study polymer weight profiles begun from a very
general initial condition. We prove that the profiles on a compact interval
resemble Brownian bridge in a uniform sense: splitting the compact interval
into a random but controlled number of patches, the profile in each patch after
affine adjustment has a Radon-Nikodym derivative that lies in every $L^p$ space
for $p \in (1,3)$. This result is proved by harnessing an understanding of the
uniform coalescence structure in the field of polymers developed in [Ham17a]
using techniques from [Ham16] and [Ham17b].

(DNNs) to adversarial examples - a visually indistinguishable adversarial image
can easily be crafted to cause a well-trained model to misclassify. Existing
methods for crafting adversarial examples are based on $L_2$ and $L_\infty$
distortion metrics. However, despite the fact that $L_1$ distortion accounts
for the total variation and encourages sparsity in the perturbation, little has
been developed for crafting $L_1$-based adversarial examples. In this paper, we
formulate the process of attacking DNNs via adversarial examples as an
elastic-net regularized optimization problem. Our elastic-net attacks to DNNs
(EAD) feature $L_1$-oriented adversarial examples and include the
state-of-the-art $L_2$ attack as a special case. Experimental results on MNIST,
CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that EAD can yield a distinct set of adversarial
examples with small $L_1$ distortion and attains similar attack performance to
the state-of-the-art methods in different attack scenarios. More importantly,
EAD leads to improved attack transferability and complements adversarial
training for DNNs, suggesting novel insights on leveraging $L_1$ distortion in
adversarial machine learning and security implications of DNNs.

the superiority of human intelligence. Studies on sketch can be roughly
summarized into recognition and generation. Existing models on image
recognition failed to obtain satisfying performance on sketch classification.
But for sketch generation, a recent study proposed a sequence-to-sequence
variational-auto-encoder (VAE) model called sketch-rnn which was able to
generate sketches based on human inputs. The model achieved amazing results
when asked to learn one category of object, such as an animal or a vehicle.
However, the performance dropped when multiple categories were fed into the
model. Here, we proposed a model called sketch-pix2seq which could learn and
draw multiple categories of sketches. Two modifications were made to improve
the sketch-rnn model: one is to replace the bidirectional recurrent neural
network (BRNN) encoder with a convolutional neural network(CNN); the other is
to remove the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the objective function of VAE.
Experimental results showed that models with CNN encoders outperformed those
with RNN encoders in generating human-style sketches. Visualization of the
latent space illustrated that the removal of KL-divergence made the encoder
learn a posterior of latent space that reflected the features of different
categories. Moreover, the combination of CNN encoder and removal of
KL-divergence, i.e., the sketch-pix2seq model, had better performance in
learning and generating sketches of multiple categories and showed promising
results in creativity tasks.

for collective fraud detection by exploring correlated and fast evolving
fraudulent behaviors. First, a heterogeneous information network is designed to
link entities of interest in the transaction database via different semantics.
Then, graph based features are efficiently discovered from the network
exploiting the concept of meta-paths, and decisions on frauds are made
collectively on test instances. Experiments on real-world payment transaction

we revealed the fundamental origin and mechanism for irreversible degradation
of hybrid perovskite materials from our new experimental results and ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We found that the photo-generated
charges trapped along the grain boundaries of the perovskite crystal result in
oxygen-induced irreversible degradation in air even in the absence of moisture.
The present result, together with our previous experimental finding on the same
critical role of trapped charges in the perovskite degradation under moisture,
suggests that the trapped charges are the main culprit in both the oxygen- and
moisture-induced degradation of perovskite materials. More detailed roles of
oxygen and water molecules were investigated by tracking the atomic motions of
the oxygen- or water-covered CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3) perovskite crystal surface with
trapped charges via AIMD simulation. In the first few picoseconds of our
simulation, trapped charges start disrupting the crystal structure, leading to
a close-range interaction between oxygen or water molecules and the
compositional ions of MAPbI3. We found that there are different degradation
pathways depending on both the polarity of the trapped charge and the kind of
gas molecule. Especially, the deprotonation of organic cations was
theoretically predicted for the first time in the presence of trapped anionic
charges and water molecules. We confirmed that a more structurally stable,
multi-component perovskite material(MA0.6FA0.4PbI2.9Br0.1) exhibited a much

transition in a semi- conductor quantum dot located in the vicinity of a metal
nanoparticle is theoretically investigated. In the model scheme, the
biexciton-exciton and exciton-ground state transitions are assumed to be
coupled to two principal plasmon modes of orthogonal polarizations. For a broad
spectral window, because the horizontal and vertical spectra are overlapped,
the biexciton and exciton photons are degenerate in energy. This allows us to
overcome the natural splitting between the intermediate exciton states.
Moreover, the degree of entanglement depends on the geometrical parameters of
the system. i.e., the radius of the metal nanoparticle and the distance between
the quantum dot and the nanoparticle. The results reveal that such a hybrid
system profoundly modifies the photon entanglement even in the absence of
strong coupling between the emitter and the metal nanosphere.

Developing such types of defenses is challenging as there are many design

transmitted symbol vector sent by uplink users (a codeword vector) by searching
over a sphere, which contains a collection of codeword vectors close to the
received signal vector at the base station in terms of a weighted Hamming
distance. To reduce the computational complexity for the construction of the
sphere, the proposed algorithm divides the received signal vector into multiple
sub-vectors each with reduced dimension. Then, it generates multiple spheres in
parallel, where each sphere is centered at the sub-vector and contains a list
of sub-codeword vectors. The detection performance of the proposed algorithm is
also analyzed by characterizing the probability that the proposed algorithm
performs worse than the MLD. The analysis shows how the dimension of each
sphere and the size of the sub-codeword list are related to the
performance-complexity tradeoff achieved by the proposed algorithm. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-MLD performance,
while reducing the computational complexity compared to the existing MLD
method.

Although the cross-power spectrum (PS) has an advantage of not correlating with
foregrounds much brighter than the 21 cm signal, the galactic and
extra-galactic foregrounds prevent detection since they contribute to the
variance of the cross PS. Therefore, strategies for mitigating foregrounds are
required. In this work, we study the impact of foreground avoidance on the
measurement of the 21 cm-LAE cross-correlation. We then simulate the 21 cm
observation as observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The point
source foreground is modelled from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky
Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogue, and the diffuse foreground
is evaluated using a parametric model. For LAE observations, we assume a large
survey of the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC), with spectroscopic observations
of the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). To predict the 21 cm signal, we employ a
numerical simulation combining post processed radiative transfer and radiation
hydrodynamics. Using these models, the signal-to-noise ratio of 2D PS shows the
foreground contamination dominates the error of cross-PS even in the so-called
`EoR window'. We find that at least 99% of the point source foreground and 80%
of the galactic diffuse foreground must be removed to measure the EoR signal at
large scales $k<0.5 h \rm Mpc^{-1}$. Additionally, a sensitivity 80 times
larger than that of the MWA operating with 128 tiles and 99% of the point

widely used to analyze the tractability of many NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems with respect to various types of problem parameters.
While the generic nature of the framework allows the analysis of any
combinatorial problem, the main focus along the years was on analyzing graph
problems. In this paper we diverge from this trend by studying the
parameterized complexity of Just-In-Time (JIT) flow-shop scheduling problems.
Our analysis focuses on the case where the number of due dates is considerably
smaller than the number of jobs, and can thus be considered as a parameter. We
prove that the two-machine problem is W[1]-hard with respect to this parameter,
even if all processing times on the second machine are of unit length, while
the problem is in XP even for a parameterized number of machines. We then move
on to study the tractability of the problem when combining the different number
of due dates with either the number of different weights or the number of
different processing times on the first machine. We prove that in both cases
the problem is fixed-parameter tractable for the two machine case, and is
W[1]-hard for three or more machines.

available experimental data, together with the low-energy theoretical
$R$-matrix extrapolations. Our new rate deviates up to about 30\% compared to
the previous ones, although all rates are consistent within the uncertainties.
At very low temperature (e.g. 0.01 GK) our reaction rate is about 20\% smaller
than the most recently published rate, because of a difference in the low
energy extrapolated $S$-factor and a more accurate estimate of the reduced mass
entering in the calculation of the reaction rate. At temperatures above $\sim$1
GK, our rate is smaller, for instance, by about 20\% around 1.75 GK, because we
have re-evaluated in a meticulous way the previous data (Isoya et al., Nucl.
Phys. 7, 116 (1958)). The present interpretation is supported by the direct
experimental data. The uncertainties of the present evaluated rate are
estimated to be about 20\% in the temperature region below 0.2 GK, which are
mainly caused by the lack of low-energy experimental data and the large
uncertainties of the existing data. The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star
evolves at temperatures below 0.2 GK, where the $^{19}$F($p$,$\alpha$)$^{16}$O
reaction may play a very important role. However, the current accuracy of the
reaction rate is insufficient to help to describe, in a careful way, for the
fluorine overabundances phenomenon observed in AGB stars. Precise cross section
(or $S$ factor) data in the low energy region are therefore mandatory for
astrophysical nucleosynthesis studies.

aesthetic presentation of classical physics in the spirit of general
relativity. The usual physical concepts, such as mass, energy, charge,
trajectory, Maxwell-Lorentz law, are shown to be only various aspects of the
geometry, for example curvature, of space-time considered as a Lorentzian
manifold; that is no physical objects are introduced in space-time, no laws are
given, everything is only geometry.
  We then extend these ideas to more than 5 dimensions, by considering
spacetime as a generalization of a $(S^1\times W)$-fiber bundle, that we named
multi-fibers bundle, where $S^1$ is the circle and $W$ a compact manifold. We
will use this geometric structure as a possible way to model or encode
deviations from standard 4-dimensional General Relativity, or ""dark"" effects
such as dark matter or energy.

absorption lines of medium and low intensity. The heliocentric radial
velocities Vr of all components of metal absorption lines, the NaI D lines, and
the H$\alpha$ line were measured for all the observation epochs. The constancy
of the absorption lines rules out the possibility that the line splitting is
due to binarity. The radial velocities of the wind components in the profiles
of the NaI D and H$\alpha$ lines reach $-250$ and $-600$ km/s, respectively.
These profiles have narrow components, whose number, depth, and position vary
with time. The time variability and multicomponent structure of the profiles of

circumstellar envelope of RAFGL 5081. The presence of components with velocity

supermassive black holes (SMBH) is considered. It is shown, under reasonable
assumptions, that the rate at which gas can be supplied to a SMBH at the center
of a young galaxy, is limited to $\sim 20 (\sigma/350~ {\rm km
~s^{-1}})^4~M_\odot/yr$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the host
bulge) by interaction of winds expelled from the innermost regions of the
accretion flow with the gas in the bulge. This rate is independent of the black
hole mass but is sensitive to the properties of the host bulge. It is further
argued that the interaction of the wind and the inflowing gas in the bulge can
strongly affect the structure of the accretion flow in the super-Eddington
regime, potentially leading to highly super-Eddington accretion into the SMBH.
About 300 Myr after the onset of the accretion phase, the AGN wind expels all
the gas from the bulge and the accretion rate is strongly suppressed. This
scenario is in remarkable agreement with recent observations, as it (i) reveals
the origin of the maximal observed accretion rates, (ii) accounts for the
inferred growth rate of SMBHs at high redshift (independent of their initial
seeds masses), (iii) elucidates the decline in the accretion rate at lower
redshifts, and (iv) explains the relation between $\sigma$ and the mass
$M_{BH}$ of the central SMBH, measured in the local Universe.

way that the social welfare is maximised, that is, the largest possible global
worth is achieved. When goods are indivisible, it is possible to use money
compensation to perform a fair allocation taking into account the actual
contribution of all agents to the social welfare. Coalitional games provide a
formal mathematical framework to model such problems, in particular the Shapley
value is a solution concept widely used for assigning worths to agents in a
fair way. Unfortunately, computing this value is a $\#{\rm P}$-hard problem, so
that applying this good theoretical notion is often quite difficult in
real-world problems.
  We describe useful properties that allow us to greatly simplify the instances
of allocation problems, without affecting the Shapley value of any player.
Moreover, we propose algorithms for computing lower bounds and upper bounds of
the Shapley value, which in some cases provide the exact result and that can be
combined with approximation algorithms.
  The proposed techniques have been implemented and tested on a real-world
application of allocation problems, namely, the Italian research assessment

the problem involves thousands of agents and goods (here, researchers and their

the Shapley value for most of those agents, and to get a good approximation of

Nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations, which use photospheric
vector magnetograms as boundary condition. (2.) Stereoscopy of coronal magnetic
loops observed in EUV coronal images from different vantage points. Both
approaches have their strength and weaknesses. Extrapolation methods are
sensitive to noise and inconsistencies in the boundary data and the accuracy of
stereoscopy is affected by the ability of identifying the same structure in
different images and by the separation angle between the view directions. As a
consequence, for the same observational data, the computed 3D coronal magnetic
field with the two methods do not necessarily coincide. In an earlier work
(Paper I) we extended our NLFFF optimization code by the inclusion of
stereoscopic constrains. The method was successfully tested with synthetic data
and within this work we apply the newly developed code to a combined data-set
from SDO/HMI, SDO/AIA and the two STEREO spacecraft. The extended method
(called S-NLFFF) contains an additional term that monitors and minimizes the
angle between the local magnetic field direction and the orientation of the 3D
coronal loops reconstructed by stereoscopy. We find that prescribing the shape
of the 3D stereoscopically reconstructed loops the S-NLFFF method leads to a
much better agreement between the modeled field and the stereoscopically
reconstructed loops. We also find an appreciable decrease by a factor of two in
the angle between the current and the magnetic field which indicates the
improved quality of the force-free solution obtained by S-NLFFF.

few Kelvin, it is possible to do so on virtue of the extremely high doping
levels found in deep-submicron CMOS technology nodes. First, any PCB component,
that does not conform with this requirement, is removed. Both the majority of
decoupling capacitor types and voltage regulators are not well behaved at
cryogenic temperatures, asking for an ad-hoc solution to stabilize the FPGA
supply voltage, especially for sensitive applications. Therefore, we have
designed a firmware that enforces a constant power consumption, so as to
stabilize the supply voltage in the interior of the FPGA chip. The FPGA is
powered with a supply at several meters distance, causing significant IR drop
and thus fluctuations on the local supply voltage. To achieve the
stabilization, the variation in digital logic speed, which directly corresponds

$S_{500} / S_{250} > 1.5$ and $S_{500} / S_{350} > 1.0$. With photometric
redshifts in the range $z \sim 4$-6, our sample includes the most luminous
starbursting systems in the early Universe known so far, with total obscured
star-formation rates (SFRs) of up to $\sim 4,500 \, M_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$,
as well as a population of lensed, less intrinsically luminous sources. The
lower limit on the number of ultrared DSFGs at 870 $\mu$m (with flux densities
measured from the ALMA maps and thus not affected by source confusion) derived
in this work is in reasonable agreement with models of galaxy evolution,
whereas there have been reports of conflicts at 500 $\mu$m (where flux
densities are derived from SPIRE). Ultrared DSFGs have a variety of
morphologies (from relatively extended disks with smooth radial profiles, to
compact sources, both isolated and interacting) and an average size,
$\theta_{\rm FWHM}$, of $1.46 \pm 0.41\, {\rm kpc}$, considerably smaller than
the values reported in previous work for less-luminous DSFGs at lower
redshifts. The size and the estimated gas-depletion times of our sources are
compatible with their being the progenitors of the most massive, compact,
red-and-dead galaxies at $z \sim 2$-3, and ultimately of local ultra-massive
elliptical galaxies or massive galaxy clusters. We are witnessing the birth of
the high-mass tail of the red sequence of galaxies.

first, from a large number of variables and second, from a potentially large
amount of prior information, e.g. stored in public repositories. We review
applications of a variety of empirical Bayes methods to several well-known
model-based prediction methods including penalized regression, linear
discriminant analysis, and Bayesian models with sparse or dense priors. We
discuss `formal' empirical Bayes methods which maximize the marginal
likelihood, but also more informal approaches based on other data summaries. We
contrast empirical Bayes to cross-validation and full Bayes, and discuss hybrid
approaches. To study the relation between the quality of an empirical Bayes
estimator and $p$, the number of variables, we consider a simple empirical
Bayes estimator in a linear model setting.
  We argue that empirical Bayes is particularly useful when the prior contains
multiple parameters which model a priori information on variables, termed
`co-data'. In particular, we present two novel examples that allow for co-data.
First, a Bayesian spike-and-slab setting that facilitates inclusion of multiple
co-data sources and types; second, a hybrid empirical Bayes-full Bayes ridge
regression approach for estimation of the posterior predictive interval.

of r<20, where very complete spectroscopic data overlapping with KiDS are
available, the performance of the ML photo-zs clearly surpasses that of BPZ,
currently the primary photo-z method for KiDS.
  Using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey as
calibration, we furthermore study how photo-zs improve for bright sources when
photometric parameters additional to magnitudes are included in the photo-z
derivation, as well as when VIKING and WISE infrared bands are added. While the
fiducial four-band ugri setup gives a photo-z bias $\delta z=-2e-4$ and scatter
$\sigma_z<0.022$ at mean z = 0.23, combining magnitudes, colours, and galaxy
sizes reduces the scatter by ~7% and the bias by an order of magnitude. Once
the ugri and IR magnitudes are joined into 12-band photometry spanning up to 12
$\mu$, the scatter decreases by more than 10% over the fiducial case. Finally,
using the 12 bands together with optical colours and linear sizes gives $\delta
z<4e-5$ and $\sigma_z<0.019$.

accompanying KiDS DR3, both obtained using the ANNz2 code. The first one, of
general purpose, includes all the 39 million KiDS sources with four-band ugri
measurements in DR3. The second dataset, optimized for low-redshift studies

processing, and many information systems; however, its generalization
performance has been left unknown because it is a singular learning machine to
which regular statistical theory can not be applied.
  Stochastic matrix factorization (SMF) is a restricted matrix factorization in
which matrix factors are stochastic; the column of the matrix is in a simplex.
SMF is being applied to image recognition and text mining. We can understand
SMF as a statistical model by which a stochastic matrix of given data is
represented by a product of two stochastic matrices, whose generalization
performance has also been left unknown because of non-regularity.
  In this paper, by using an algebraic and geometric method, we show the
analytic equivalence of LDA and SMF, both of which have the same real log
canonical threshold (RLCT), resulting in that they asymptotically have the same
Bayesian generalization error and the same log marginal likelihood. Moreover,
we derive the upper bound of the RLCT and prove that it is smaller than the
dimension of the parameter divided by two, hence the Bayesian generalization
errors of them are smaller than those of regular statistical models.

on one or two datasets, either because of time restraints or because the model

we contribute to this situation by comparing several models on six different

Bi-LSTMs perform well across datasets and that both LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs are

with the ease of management, elasticity, and fault tolerance. To take advantage
of these benefits, many enterprises are contemplating to outsource the
middlebox processing services in the cloud. However, middleboxes that process
confidential and private data cannot be securely deployed in the untrusted
environment of the cloud.
  To securely outsource middleboxes to the cloud, the state-of-the-art systems
advocate network processing over the encrypted traffic. Unfortunately, these
systems support only restrictive middlebox functionalities, and incur
prohibitively high overheads due to the complex computations involved over the
encrypted traffic.
  This motivated the design of Slick --- a secure middlebox framework for
deploying high-performance Network Functions (NFs) on untrusted commodity
servers. Slick exposes a generic interface based on Click to design and
implement a wide-range of NFs using its out-of-the box elements and C++
extensions. Slick leverages SCONE (a shielded execution framework based on
Intel SGX) and DPDK to securely process confidential data at line rate.
  More specifically, Slick provides hardware-assisted memory protection, and
configuration and attestation service for seamless and verifiable deployment of
middleboxes.
  We have also added several new features for commonly required
functionalities: new specialized Click elements for secure packet processing,
secure shared memory packet transfer for NFs chaining, secure state
persistence, an efficient on-NIC timer for SGX enclaves, and memory safety
against DPDK-specific Iago attacks. Furthermore, we have implemented several
SGX-specific optimizations in Slick. Our evaluation shows that Slick achieves
near-native throughput and latency.

wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) taking into account residual
hardware impairments (HWIs) at the transceivers, the imperfectness of the
channel state information, and the non-linearity of practical radio frequency
energy harvesting circuits. In order to ensure power-efficient secure
communication, physical layer security techniques are exploited to deliberately
degrade the channel quality of a multiple-antenna eavesdropper. The resource
allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem
for minimization of the total consumed power in the network, while guaranteeing
the quality of service of the information receivers in terms of secrecy rate.
The globally optimal solution of the optimization problem is obtained via a
two-dimensional search and semidefinite programming relaxation. To strike a
balance between computational complexity and system performance, a
low-complexity iterative suboptimal resource allocation algorithm is then
proposed.
  Numerical results demonstrate that both the proposed optimal and suboptimal
schemes can significantly reduce the total system power consumption required
for guaranteeing secure communication, and unveil the impact of HWIs on the
system performance: (1) residual HWIs create a system performance bottleneck in
the high transmit/receive power regimes; (2) increasing the number of transmit
antennas can effectively reduce the system power consumption and alleviate the
performance degradation due to residual HWIs; (3) imperfect CSI increases the
system power consumption and exacerbates the impact of residual HWIs.

explore several structural properties of Borel subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ that

dense star-forming regions. In this respect, dense cores believed to be
precursors of clusters containing also intermediate- and high-mass stars are
important targets, as the Solar System was probably born within a rich stellar
cluster. In this work, we show the results of IRAM-30m observations of the
J=1-0 rotational transition of the molecules HCN and HNC, and their
$^{15}$N-bearing counterparts, towards 27 intermediate/high-mass dense cores
divided in three evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass
protostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We have also observed the
DNC(2-1) rotational transition, in order to search for a relation between the
isotopic ratios D/H and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N. We derive average $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N
ratios of $359\pm16$ in HCN and of $438\pm21$ in HNC, with a dispersion of
about 150-200. We find no trend of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio with the
evolutionary stage. This result agrees with what found from N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and
its isotopologues in the same sources, although the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios
from N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ show a dispersion larger than that in HCN/HNC. Moreover, we
have found no correlation between D/H and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N in HNC. These

consistent with having formed empty, without any planetesimals between Mars and
Jupiter's present-day orbits. This is consistent with models in which drifting
dust is concentrated into an isolated annulus of terrestrial planetesimals.
Gravitational scattering during terrestrial planet formation causes radial
spreading, transporting planetesimals from inside 1-1.5 AU out to the belt.
Several times the total current mass in S-types is implanted, with a preference
for the inner main belt. C-types are implanted from the outside, as the giant
planets' gas accretion destabilizes nearby planetesimals and injects a fraction
into the asteroid belt, preferentially in the outer main belt. These
implantation mechanisms are simple byproducts of terrestrial- and giant planet
formation. The asteroid belt may thus represent a repository for planetary
leftovers that accreted across the Solar System but not in the belt itself.

of the CTA. Measurements of absorption and scattering properties of the
atmosphere due to aerosols and molecules can be used in the event
reconstruction or in MODTRAN, an analytical code designed to model the
propagation of electromagnetic radiation. MODTRAN output is used as an input
for the air shower simulation and Cherenkov light production, giving the
optical depth profiles that together with the refractive index allow the proper
simulation of the gamma ray induced signals and a correct measurement of the
primary energy from the detected signals. The ARCADE Raman Lidar will be used
for the on site characterization of the aerosol attenuation profiles of the UV
light. The collected data will be used in preparation for the full operation of
the array, providing nightly information about the aerosol properties such as
the vertical aerosol optical depth and the water vapour mixing ratio with an
altitude resolution better than 100 m from about 400 m to 10 km above ground

subcarrier allocation have been investigated for enhancing the spectral
efficiency of multi-user orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
cognitive radio (CR) networks subject to satisfying total average transmission
power and aggregate interference constraints. We propose novel optimal radio
resource allocation (RRA) algorithms under different scenarios with
deterministic and probabilistic interference violation limits based on a
perfect and imperfect availability of cross-link channel state information
(CSI). In particular, we propose a probabilistic approach to mitigate the total
imposed interference on the primary service under imperfect cross-link CSI. A
closed-form mathematical formulation of the cumulative density function (cdf)
for the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is formulated
to evaluate the resultant average spectral efficiency (ASE). Dual decomposition
is utilized to obtain sub-optimal solutions for the non-convex optimization
problems. Through simulation results, we investigate the achievable performance
and the impact of parameters uncertainty on the overall system performance.
Furthermore, we present that the developed RRA algorithms can considerably
improve the cognitive performance whilst abide the imposed power constraints.
In particular, the performance under imperfect cross-link CSI knowledge for the
proposed `probabilistic case' is compared to the conventional scenarios to show
the potential gain in employing this scheme.

build a hierarchical recurrent neural network using bidirectional LSTM as a
base unit and the conditional random field (CRF) as the top layer to classify
each utterance into its corresponding dialogue act. The hierarchical network
learns representations at multiple levels, i.e., word level, utterance level,

CRF layer, which takes into account not only all previous utterances but also
their dialogue acts, thus modeling the dependency among both, labels and
utterances, an important consideration of natural dialogue. We validate our
approach on two different benchmark data sets, Switchboard and Meeting Recorder
Dialogue Act, and show performance improvement over the state-of-the-art
methods by $2.2\%$ and $4.1\%$ absolute points, respectively. It is worth
noting that the inter-annotator agreement on Switchboard data set is $84\%$,

nullity 1 and for which non-trivial kernel vectors do not contain a zero.
Chemical graphs are connected, with maximum degree at most three. We present a
new algorithm for the exhaustive generation of non-isomorphic nut graphs. Using
this algorithm, we determined all nut graphs up to 13 vertices and all chemical
nut graphs up to 22 vertices. Furthermore, we determined all nut graphs among

  Nut graphs are of interest in chemistry of conjugated systems, in models of
electronic structure, radical reactivity and molecular conduction. The relevant
mathematical properties of chemical nut graphs are the position of the zero
eigenvalue in the graph spectrum, and the dispersion in magnitudes of kernel
eigenvector entries ($r$: the ratio of maximum to minimum magnitude of
entries). Statistics are gathered on these properties for all the nut graphs
generated here. We also show that all chemical nut graphs have $r \ge 2$ and

  Belgium, 10-12 October 2017 (arXiv:1708.07854)",,,"LOPSTR/2017/15","cs.PL cs.DC cs.LO cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been recently proposed that testing based on symbolic execution can be
used in conjunction with static deadlock analysis to define a deadlock
detection framework that: (i) can show deadlock presence, in that case a
concrete test-case and trace are obtained, and (ii) can also prove deadlock
freedom. Such symbolic execution starts from an initial distributed context,
i.e., a set of locations and their initial tasks. Considering all possibilities
results in a combinatorial explosion on the different distributed contexts that
must be considered. This paper proposes a technique to effectively generate
initial contexts that can lead to deadlock, using the possible conflicting task
interactions identified by static analysis, discarding other distributed
contexts that cannot lead to deadlock. The proposed technique has been
integrated in the above-mentioned deadlock detection framework hence enabling
it to analyze systems without the need of any user supplied initial context.

exponential and Kasner asymptotes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmologies --
spatial curvature and anisotropy in both three- and extra-dimensional

spaces being the product of two isotropic and spatially curved subspaces. It is
demonstrated that the dynamics in $D=2$ (the number of extra dimensions) and $D
\geqslant 3$ is different. It was already known that for the $\Lambda$-term
case there is a regime with ""stabilization"" of extra dimensions, where the
expansion rate of the three-dimensional subspace as well as the scale factor
(the ""size"") associated with extra dimensions reach constant value. This regime
is achieved if the curvature of the extra dimensions is negative. We
demonstrate that it take place only if the number of extra dimensions is $D
\geqslant 3$. In the second part of the paper we study the influence of initial
anisotropy. Our study reveals that the transition from Gauss-Bonnet Kasner
regime to anisotropic exponential expansion (with expanding three and
contracting extra dimensions) is stable with respect to breaking the symmetry
within both three- and extra-dimensional subspaces. However, the details of the
dynamics in $D=2$ and $D \geqslant 3$ are different. Combining the two
described affects allows us to construct a scenario in $D \geqslant 3$, where
isotropisation of outer and inner subspaces is reached dynamically from rather

Clearly, developing ways of quantifying non-locality is an important primitive
in this scenario. Here, we propose to quantify the non-locality of a given
probability distribution via its trace distance to the set of classical

Centre consists of young and old stars, with most of the stellar mass in an
extended, cuspy distribution of old stars. The compact cluster of young stars
was probably born in situ in a massive accretion disc around the black hole. We
investigate the effect of the growing gravity of the disc on the orbits of the
old stars, using an integrable model of the deformation of a spherical star
cluster with anisotropic velocity dispersions. A formula for the perturbed
phase space distribution function is derived using linear theory, and new
density and surface density profiles are computed. The cusp undergoes a
spheroidal deformation with the flattening increasing strongly at smaller
distances from the black hole; the intrinsic axis ratio ~ 0.8 at ~ 0.15 pc.
Stellar orbits are deformed such that they spend more time near the disc plane
and sample the dense inner parts of the disc; this could result in enhanced
stripping of the envelopes of red giant stars. Linear theory accounts only for
orbits whose apsides circulate. The non-linear theory of adiabatic capture into
resonance is needed to understand orbits whose apsides librate. The mechanism
is a generic dynamical process, and it may be common in galactic nuclei.

arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in

different answer entities at different positions in a single response,
according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations
of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We
collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge

methods significantly in terms of the BLEU, entity accuracy, entity recall and

Namely, the velocity of photons in vacuum could depend on their energies. One
possibility for Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) searches is to look for
energy-dependent delays in the arrival time of very high energy (VHE) photons
coming from distant sources such as TeV emitting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
mainly blazars. Up to now, observations of flaring AGN have only provided upper
limits on LIV energy scale since no significant time-delay was found and
confirmed. However, AGN are not perfect sources for such LIV searches because
intrinsic temporal effects can be produced by emission processes, similarly to
what has been observed with gamma-ray bursts. With the beginning of the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) operations in the coming decade, significant
lags should be measured and the question of the origin of these lags will
arise. In particular, propagation effects (LIV) will have to be disentangled
from source-intrinsic effects. A precise time-dependent modeling of blazar
flares becomes necessary to understand the different origins of these
time-delays. In this contribution we report on time-delay studies for blazars
in the VHE domain. Using dif- ferent time-dependent emission scenarios of
blazar flares, we illustrate their resulting intrinsic spectral lags and
provide tools for further analyses of the fine temporal and spectral behavior
of such astrophysical sources. Tightly constraining intrinsic effects should
then allow to better high- light any extrinsic contribution due to LIV.
Conversely, any significant detection of a time-delay should provide new
constraints on emission scenarios.

delay-robust control of systems composed of two linear first order hyperbolic
equations. One must go back to the classical trade-off between convergence rate
and delay-robustness. More precisely, we prove that, for systems with strong
reflections, canceling the reflection at the actuated boundary will yield zero
delay-robustness. Indeed, for such systems, using a backstepping-controller,
the corresponding target system should preserve a small amount of this
reflection to ensure robustness to a small delay in the loop. This implies, in
some cases, giving up finite time convergence.

  High-Frequency Virtual Snapshotting",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient transactional management is a delicate task. As systems face
transactions of inherently different types, ranging from point updates to long
running analytical computations, it is hard to satisfy their individual
requirements with a single processing component. Unfortunately, most systems
nowadays rely on such a single component that implements its parallelism using
multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). While MVCC parallelizes short-running
OLTP transactions very well, it struggles in the presence of mixed workloads
containing long-running scan-centric OLAP queries, as scans have to work their
way through large amounts of versioned data. To overcome this problem, we
propose a system, which reintroduces the concept of heterogeneous transaction
processing: OLAP transactions are outsourced to run on separate (virtual)
snapshots while OLTP transactions run on the most recent representation of the
database. Inside both components, MVCC ensures a high degree of concurrency.
The biggest challenge of such a heterogeneous approach is to generate the
snapshots at a high frequency. Previous approaches heavily suffered from the
tremendous cost of snapshot creation. In our system, we overcome the
restrictions of the OS by introducing a custom system call vm_snapshot, that is
hand-tailored to our precise needs: it allows fine-granular snapshot creation
at very high frequencies, rendering the snapshot creation phase orders of
magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental evaluation
on a heterogeneous workload based on TPC-H transactions and handcrafted OLTP
transactions shows that our system enables significantly higher analytical
transaction throughputs on mixed workloads than homogeneous approaches. In this
sense, we introduce a system that accelerates Analytical processing by
introducing custom Kernel functionalities: AnKerDB.

$\delta_{0}$ is the Dirac measure at the lattice points. This confirms a
conjecture in \cite{CLW2} and also improves a result of Eremenko and Gabrielov
\cite{EG}. The nonexistence is a delicate problem because the equation always
has solutions if $8\pi n$ in the RHS is replaced by $2\pi \rho$ with
$0<\rho\notin 4\mathbb{N}$. Geometrically, our result implies that a
rectangular torus $E_{\tau}$ admits a metric with curvature $+1$ acquiring a
conic singularity at the lattice points with angle $2\pi\alpha$ if and only if
$\alpha$ is not an odd integer.
  Unexpectedly, our proof of the nonexistence result is to apply the spectral
theory of finite-gap potential, or equivalently the algebro-geometric solutions
of stationary KdV hierarchy equations. Indeed, our proof can also yield a sharp
nonexistence result for the curvature equation with singular sources at three
half periods and the lattice points.

sensing to detect the presence of plants to sophisticated sensing technology,

intrigue. The recent discovery of an unexpected bump in the reactor

different for different fission isotopes seems to disfavour the explanation of
the anomaly in terms of sterile neutrino oscillations. We critically review
this conclusion in view of all available data on electron (anti)neutrino
disappearance. We find that the sterile neutrino hypothesis cannot be rejected
based on global data and is only mildly disfavored compared to an individual
rescaling of neutrino fluxes from different fission isotopes. The main reason
for this is the presence of spectral features in recent data from the NEOS and
DANSS experiments. If state-of-the-art predictions for reactor fluxes are taken
at face value, sterile neutrino oscillations allow a consistent description of
global data with a significance close to $3\sigma$ relative to the
no-oscillation case. Even if reactor fluxes and spectra are left free in the
fit, a $2\sigma$ hint in favour of sterile neutrinos remains, with allowed
parameter regions consistent with an explanation of the anomaly in terms of

by Feng, Lewis, and Neilan in [Feng2013]. It is proved that the proposed DR
method converges and that the DG-FE numerical derivatives exhibit a compactness

problems with more complex energy functionals. Numerical tests are provided on
the classical $p$-Laplace problem to gauge the performance of the proposed DR

utmost importance to realise a quantum computer. Laflamme showed that 5 qubits
are necessary to correct a single error on a qubit. In a Pauli error model,
four different types of errors can occur on a qubit. Maximally entangled states
are orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a
measurement in the Bell basis. Thus a measurement in Bell basis and a unitary
transformation is sufficient to correct error in Bell states. However, such a
measurement is not possible for non-maximally entangled states. In this work we
show that the 16 possible errors for a non-maximally entangled two qubit system
map to only 8 distinct error states. Hence, it is possible to correct the error
without perfect knowledge of the type of error. Furthermore, we show that the
possible errors can be grouped in such a way that all 4 errors can occur on one
qubit, whereas only bit flip error can occur on the second qubit. As a
consequence, instead of 10, only 8 qubits are sufficient to correct a single
error. We propose an 8-qubit error correcting code to correct a single error in
a non-maximally entangled state. We further argue that for an $n$-qubit
non-maximally entangled state of the form $a|0>^{n} + b|1>^{n}$, it is always
possible to correct a single error with fewer than $5n$ qubits, in fact only
$3n+2$ qubits suffice.

four CFHTLS-Wide fields (except one quarter of the W3 field) in the Y-band with
the WIRCam instrument at the CFHT. Each field was visited twice, at least three
weeks apart. Each visit consisted of two dithered exposures. The images are

one-square-degree tiles matched to the format of the CFHTLS data release.
Photometric calibration is performed on stars by fitting stellar spectra to
their CFHTLS photometric data and extrapolating their Y-band magnitudes. We
measure a limiting magnitude of Y$_{AB} \simeq 22.4$ for point sources

partly thermal and partly coherent emission around the lasing threshold. For
higher pump powers, the strong mode of microlaser A emits Poissonian
distributed photons while the emission of the weak mode is thermal. In

This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement
learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical RL, generative adversarial
networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of
multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often
leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with
Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the
anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning
rule includes a term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the
anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Results show that the
encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and
therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma, while independent
learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared
to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order
gradient-based methods. Applied to repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents
converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA
agents successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning
algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the
IPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using
an extension of the policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for
model-free RL. The method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and
nonlinear function approximators. We apply LOLA to a grid world task with an
embedded social dilemma using recurrent policies and opponent modelling. By
explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to
cooperate out of self-interest. The code is at github.com/alshedivat/lola.

over 9100 astronomical observations, almost 900 of which were calibration
observations in the course of the nearly four-year Herschel mission. The data
from each observation had to be converted from raw telemetry into calibrated
products and were included in the Herschel Science Archive. {Aims}. The HIFI
pipeline was designed to provide robust conversion from raw telemetry into
calibrated data throughout all phases of the HIFI missions. Pre-launch
laboratory testing was supported as were routine mission operations. {Methods}.
A modular software design allowed components to be easily added, removed,
amended and/or extended as the understanding of the HIFI data developed during
and after mission operations. {Results}. The HIFI pipeline processed data from
all HIFI observing modes within the Herschel automated processing environment
as well as within an interactive environment. The same software can be used by
the general astronomical community to reprocess any standard HIFI observation.
The pipeline also recorded the consistency of processing results and provided
automated quality reports. Many pipeline modules were in use since the HIFI
pre-launch instrument level testing. {Conclusions}. Processing in steps
facilitated data analysis to discover and address instrument artefacts and
uncertainties. The availability of the same pipeline components from pre-launch
throughout the mission made for well-understood, tested, and stable processing.
A smooth transition from one phase to the next significantly enhanced

leverages the local and global cues in human body to generate a discriminative

order, thus including the interaction-irreducible (i.e., not averaged) diagrams
with three-nucleon forces that have been previously neglected. We employ the
algebraic diagrammatic construction up to the third order as an organization
scheme for generating a non perturbative self-energy, in which ring

orders. We derive expressions of the static and dynamic self-energy up to the
third order, by taking into account the set of diagrams required when either
the skeleton or nonskeleton expansions of the single-particle propagator are
assumed. A hierarchy of importance among different diagrams is revealed, and a
particular emphasis is given to a third-order diagram (see Fig. 2c) that is
expected to play a significant role among those featuring an
interaction-irreducible three-nucleon force. A consistent formalism to resum at
infinite order correlations induced by three-nucleon forces in the

modes for an appropriate choice of prior distribution. Bayesian shrinkage
methods, particularly the horseshoe estimator, have recently attracted a great
deal of attention in the problem of estimating sparse, high-dimensional linear
models. This paper extends these ideas, and presents a Bayesian grouped model
with continuous global-local shrinkage priors to handle complex group
hierarchies that include overlapping and multilevel group structures. As the
posterior mean is never a sparse estimate of the linear model coefficients, we
extend the recently proposed decoupled shrinkage and selection (DSS) technique
to the problem of selecting groups of variables from posterior samples. To
choose a final, sparse model, we also adapt generalised information criteria
approaches to the DSS framework. To ensure that sparse groups, in which only a
few predictors are active, can be effectively identified, we provide an
alternative degrees of freedom estimator for sparse Bayesian linear models that
takes into account the effects of shrinkage on the model coefficients.
Simulations and real data analysis using our proposed method show promising
performance in terms of correct identification of active and inactive groups,
and prediction, in comparison with a Bayesian grouped slab-and-spike approach.

equivalent to that of Lagrangians $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. The energy
transfer between the fluid components is determined by functions $V(\phi)$,
$F(X)$ and their derivatives. Such a realisation is shown to be consistent with
the Supernova Ia data with certain constraints on the temporal behaviour of
$k-$essence potential $V(\phi)$. We have described a methodology to obtain such

model superior to other candidate models. In the presence of pronounced noise,
however, multiple models are often found to explain the same data equally well.
To resolve this model selection ambiguity, we introduce the general approach of
model selection confidence sets (MSCSs) based on likelihood ratio testing. A
MSCS is defined as a list of models statistically indistinguishable from the
true model at a user-specified level of confidence, which extends the familiar
notion of confidence intervals to the model-selection framework. Our approach
guarantees asymptotically correct coverage probability of the true model when
both sample size and model dimension increase. We derive conditions under which
the MSCS contains all the relevant information about the true model structure.
In addition, we propose natural statistics based on the MSCS to measure
importance of variables in a principled way that accounts for the overall model
uncertainty. When the space of feasible models is large, MSCS is implemented by
an adaptive stochastic search algorithm which samples MSCS models with high
probability. The MSCS methodology is illustrated through numerical experiments
on synthetic data and real data examples.

a central role in neural network binarization. In this work, we reveal an
important fact that binarizing different layers has a widely-varied effect on

fact, we propose a novel and flexible neural network binarization method by
introducing the concept of layer-wise priority which binarizes parameters in

significant that we can flexibly decide whether to binarize the remaining

efficient pedestrian detection. Extensive experimental results on several

lower miss rate and faster detection speed than the state-of-the-art neural

should be placed accordingly based on different depth within a network: smaller
boxes on high-resolution layers with a smaller stride while larger boxes on
low-resolution counterparts with a larger stride. Inspired by the conv/deconv
structure, we fully leverage the low-level local details and high-level
regional semantics from two feature map streams, which are complimentary to
each other, to identify the objectness in an image. A map attention decision
(MAD) unit is further proposed to aggressively search for neuron activations
among two streams and attend the most contributive ones on the feature learning
of the final loss. The unit serves as a decisionmaker to adaptively activate
maps along certain channels with the solely purpose of optimizing the overall
training loss. One advantage of MAD is that the learned weights enforced on
each feature channel is predicted on-the-fly based on the input context, which
is more suitable than the fixed enforcement of a convolutional kernel.

epoch of reionization and comic dawn in the forthcoming decades. This prospect
stimulates the development of the theoretical basis for simulating the power
spectrum of this line. Because of the beam size of the upcoming radio
telescopes at high redshifts, most of the theoretical models are focused on the
inhomogeneities on scales above few comoving megaparsecs. Therefore, smaller
scales are often neglected and modeled with approximated sub-grid models. In
this study we explore whether the perturbations on small scales ($\lesssim
1h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$) can affect the 21cm signal on larger scales. Two distinct
mechanism are discussed. First, we show that during the cosmic dawn small scale
perturbations regulate the formation time of the first Lyman-alpha Emitters
(LAE), and consequently the coupling timing of spin and kinetic temperatures.
Due to the low number density of LAE, the inhomogeneity of coupling includes
the shot noise and manifests itself in the observed 21cm power spectrum. Second
mechanism works during the reionization when the ionized bubbles actively grow
and overlap. Small scales perturbations affect the galactic properties and
merger histories, and consequently the number of ionizing photons produced by
each galaxy. The ionizing photons bring the perturbations from the galactic
scales to the scales of ionizing fronts, affecting the 21cm power spectrum. We
conclude that these two effects introduce stochasticity in the potentially
observed 21cm power spectrum and, moreover, might give another perspective into
the physics of the first galaxies.

drift force for active matter particles moving through a random obstacle array.
We find that for low drift force, there is an initial flow regime where the
mobility increases linearly with drive, while for higher drift forces a regime
of negative differential mobility appears in which the velocity decreases with
increasing drive due to the trapping of active particles behind obstacles. A
fully clogged regime exists at very high drift forces when all the particles
are permanently trapped behind obstacles. We find for increasing activity that
the overall mobility is nonmonotonic, with an enhancement of the mobility for
small levels of activity and a decrease in mobility for large activity levels.
We show how these effects evolve as a function of disk and obstacle density,
active run length, drift force, and motor force.

  Applied Mathematics in Honour of John Blake",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of simplest examples of navigation found in nature is run-and-tumble
chemotaxis. Tumbles reorient cells randomly, and cells can drift toward
attractants or away from repellents by biasing the frequency of these events.
The post-tumble swimming directions are typically correlated with those prior,
as measured by the variance of the reorientation angle distribution. This
variance can range from large, in the case of bacteria, to so small that tumble
events are imperceptible, as observed in choanoflagellates. This raises the
question of optimality: why is such a range of persistence observed in nature?
Here we study persistent run-and-tumble dynamics, focusing first on the
optimisation of the linearised chemotactic response within the two-dimensional
parameter space of tumble frequency and angular persistence. Although an
optimal persistence does exist for a given tumble frequency, in the full
parameter space there is a continuum of optimal solutions. Introducing finite
tumble times that depend on the persistence can change this picture,
illuminating one possible method for selecting tumble persistence based on
species-specific reorientation dynamics. Moving beyond linear theory we find
that optimal chemotactic strengths exist, and that these maximise reaction when
swimming in a wrong direction, but have little or no reaction when swimming
with even the slightest projection along the chemoattractant gradient.

two ideas: 1) to use a different relaxation order for each constraint, and 2)
to iteratively seek a closest measure to the truncated moment data until a

two main difficulties: the extremal equations involve forward and backward
terms, and besides, the related shooting method has to be carefully
initialized. Here, starting from the solution of the non-delayed version of the
optimal control problem, delays are introduced by a numerical continuation.
This creates a sequence of optimal delayed solutions that converges to the
desired solution. We establish a convergence theorem ensuring the continuous

divide-and-conquer for large- scale data analysis has recently attracted
considerable interest due to great popularity of the MapReduce programming
paradigm in the Apache Hadoop software framework. The central analytic task in
the development of statistical inference in the MapReduce paradigm pertains to
the method of combining results yielded from separately mapped data batches.
One seminal solution based on the confidence distribution has recently been
established in the setting of maximum likelihood estimation in the literature.
This paper concerns a more general inferential methodology based on estimating
functions, termed as the Rao-type confidence distribution, of which the maximum
likelihood is a special case. This generalization provides a unified framework
of statistical inference that allows regression analyses of massive data sets
of important types in a parallel and scalable fashion via a distributed file
system, including longitudinal data analysis, survival data analysis, and
quantile regression, which cannot be handled using the maximum likelihood
method. This paper investigates four important properties of the proposed
method: computational scalability, statistical optimality, methodological
generality, and operational robustness. In particular, the proposed method is
shown to be closely connected to Hansen's generalized method of moments (GMM)
and Crowder's optimality. An interesting theoretical finding is that the
asymptotic efficiency of the proposed Rao-type confidence distribution
estimator is always greater or equal to the estimator obtained by processing
the full data once. All these properties of the proposed method are illustrated
via numerical examples in both simulation studies and real-world data analyses.

solution are much like a Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole in spite of that a
global charge cannot be defined for the vector. For non-minimal theories, we
obtain a lot of exact black hole solutions, depending on the parameters of the
theories. In particular, many of the solutions are general static and have
maximal symmetry. However, there are some subtleties and ambiguities in the
derivation of the first laws because the existence of an algebraic degree of
freedom of the vector in general invalids the Wald entropy formula. The
thermodynamics of these solutions deserves further studies.

promise unprecedented opportunities to probe the central engines of
core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) and gamma-ray bursts. Compared to neutron
stars, central engines powered by black hole-disk or torus systems may be of
particular interest to multi-messenger observations by the relatively large

pump-probe measurements, in which information about the dynamics is obtained
from the transient signal associated with the excited state. Background signals
provoked by pump and/or probe pulses alone often obscure these excited state
signals. Simple subtraction of pump-only and/or probe-only measurements from
the pump-probe measurement, as commonly applied, results in a degradation of
the signal-to-noise ratio and, in the case of coincidence detection, the danger
of overrated background subtraction. Coincidence measurements additionally
suffer from false coincidences. Here we present a probabilistic approach based
on Bayesian probability theory that overcomes these problems. For a pump-probe
experiment with photoelectron-photoion coincidence detection we reconstruct the
interesting excited-state spectrum from pump-probe and pump-only measurements.
This approach allows to treat background and false coincidences consistently
and on the same footing. We demonstrate that the Bayesian formalism has the
following advantages over simple signal subtraction: (i) the signal-to-noise
ratio is significantly increased, (ii) the pump-only contribution is not
overestimated, (iii) false coincidences are excluded, (iv) prior knowledge,
such as positivity, is consistently incorporated, (v) confidence intervals are
provided for the reconstructed spectrum, and (vi) it is applicable to any
experimental situation and noise statistics. Most importantly, by accounting
for false coincidences, the Bayesian approach allows to run experiments at
higher ionization rates, resulting in a significant reduction of data
acquisition times. The application to pump-probe coincidence measurements on
acetone molecules enables novel quantitative interpretations about the
molecular decay dynamics and fragmentation behavior.

the {\it Kepler} satellite in the optical, and radio telescopes at GHz

dex in temporal frequencies. Our analysis reveals that the radio power spectra
are of a colored-noise type on timescales ranging from tens of years down to
months, with no evidence for breaks or other spectral features. The overall
optical power spectrum is also consistent with a colored noise on the
variability timescales ranging from 117 years down to hours, with no hints of
any quasi-periodic oscillations. The X-ray power spectrum resembles the radio
and optical power spectra on the analogous timescales ranging from tens of
years down to months. Finally, the $\gamma$-ray power spectrum is noticeably
different from the radio, optical, and X-ray power spectra of the source: we
have detected a characteristic relaxation timescale in the {\it Fermi}-LAT
data, corresponding to $\sim 150$\,days, such that on timescales longer than
this, the power spectrum is consistent with uncorrelated (white) noise, while
on shorter variability timescales there is correlated (colored) noise.

services by running Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on commercial
off-the-shelf servers. Service deployment involves placement of VNFs and
in-sequence routing of traffic flows through VNFs comprising a Service Chain
(SC). The joint VNF placement and traffic routing is called SC mapping. In a
Wide-Area Network (WAN), a situation may arise where several traffic flows,
generated by many distributed node pairs, require the same SC; then, a single
instance (or occurrence) of that SC might not be enough. SC mapping with
multiple SC instances for the same SC turns out to be a very complex problem,
since the sequential traversal of VNFs has to be maintained while accounting
for traffic flows in various directions. Our study is the first to deal with
the problem of SC mapping with multiple SC instances to minimize network
resource consumption. We first propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to solve
this problem. Since ILP does not scale to large networks, we develop a
column-generation-based ILP (CG-ILP) model. However, we find that exact
mathematical modeling of the problem results in quadratic constraints in our
CG-ILP. The quadratic constraints are made linear but even the scalability of
CG-ILP is limited. Hence, we also propose a two-phase column-generation-based
approach to get results over large network topologies within reasonable
computational times. Using such an approach, we observe that an appropriate
choice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to a solution very close to
the minimum bandwidth consumption. Further, this approach also helps us to
analyze the effects of number of VNF replicas and number of NFV nodes on
bandwidth consumption when deploying these minimum number of SC instances.

well-controlled laboratory experiments. This paper describes our approach to
detect and to predict natural human arm movements in the future, a key
challenge in brain computer interfacing that has never before been attempted.
We introduce the novel Annotated Joints in Long-term ECoG (AJILE) dataset;
AJILE includes automatically annotated poses of 7 upper body joints for four
human subjects over 670 total hours (more than 72 million frames), along with
the corresponding simultaneously acquired intracranial neural recordings. The
size and scope of AJILE greatly exceeds all previous datasets with movements
and electrocorticography (ECoG), making it possible to take a deep learning
approach to movement prediction. We propose a multimodal model that combines
deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM)
blocks, leveraging both ECoG and video modalities. We demonstrate that our
models are able to detect movements and predict future movements up to 800 msec
before movement initiation. Further, our multimodal movement prediction models
exhibit resilience to simulated ablation of input neural signals. We believe a
multimodal approach to natural neural decoding that takes context into account
is critical in advancing bioelectronic technologies and human neuroscience.

contrast to popular point cloud registration approaches such as ICP our method
does not rely on explicit data association and exploits multiple modalities

are handled in an uniform manner and the registration is obtained by minimizing
the pixel-wise difference between two multi-channel images. We developed a
flexible and general framework and implemented our approach inside that

experiments show that our approach allows for an accurate registration of the
sensor data without requiring an explicit data association or model-specific
adaptations to datasets or sensors. Our approach exploits the different cues in
a natural and consistent way and the registration can be done at framerate for
a typical range or imaging sensor.

presence of noise arising from amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE) as
well as from a non-ideal transceiver subsystem. Its impact on signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and reach increase is studied with particular emphasis on split
NLC, where the digital back-propagation algorithm is divided between
transmitter and receiver. An analytical model is presented to compute the SNR's
for non-ideal transmission systems with arbitrary split NLC configurations.
When signal-signal nonlinearities are compensated, the performance limitation
arises from residual signal-noise interactions. These interactions consist of
nonlinear beating between the signal and co-propagating ASE and transceiver
noise. While transceiver noise-signal beating is usually dominant for short
transmission distances, ASE noise-signal beating is dominant for larger
transmission distances. It is shown that both regimes behave differently with
respect to the optimal NLC split ratio and their respective reach gains.
Additionally, simple formulas for the prediction of the optimal NLC split ratio
and the reach increase in those two regimes are reported. It is found that
split NLC offers negligible gain with respect to conventional digital
back-propagation (DBP) for distances less than 1000 km using standard
single-mode fibers and a transceiver (back-to-back) SNR of 26 dB, when
transmitter and receiver inject the same amount of noise. However, when
transmitter and receiver inject an unequal amount of noise, reach gains of 56%
on top of DBP are achievable by properly tailoring the split NLC algorithm. The
theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations.

efficiency, however, all the cooperative schemes use opportunistic cooperation
and optimize for either energy or accuracy. Considering the existence of a
reasonably stable group of mobile nodes like animals, birds, and mobile assets,
we propose a cluster-based cooperative tracking algorithm, where cluster head
centrally coordinates resource usage among cluster members. Variants of this
strategy include the use of a cooperative Kalman filter with and without
inertial sensor inputs to estimate nodes positions. We use the Boid flocking
algorithm to generate group position movements in 3D and perform various
experiments to compare the energy and position accuracy tradeoff of our
proposed scheme with individual-based tracking and existing cooperative
schemes. We perform the experiments for fixed periodic GPS sampling and dynamic
GPS sampling triggered by node position error uncertainty tolerance limit.
Experiments results show that in periodic sampling scheme cooperative tracking
yields more than one-quarter reduction in energy consumption and more than
one-third improvement in position accuracy over individual-based tracking,
