method based on evolutionary computation which is a model inspired from human
behavior. Based on this model, a four layer process for image segmentation is
proposed using the split/merge approach. In the first layer, an image is split
into numerous regions using the watershed algorithm. In the second layer, a
co-evolutionary process is applied to form centers of finals segments by
merging similar primary regions. In the third layer, a meta-heuristic process
uses two operators to connect the residual regions to their corresponding
determined centers. In the final layer, an evolutionary algorithm is used to
combine the resulted similar and neighbor regions. Different layers of the
algorithm are totally independent, therefore for certain applications a
specific layer can be changed without constraint of changing other layers. Some
properties of this algorithm like the flexibility of its method, the ability to
use different feature vectors for segmentation (grayscale, color, texture,
etc), the ability to control uniformity and the number of final segments using
free parameters and also maintaining small regions, makes it possible to apply
the algorithm to different applications. Moreover, the independence of each
region from other regions in the second layer, and the independence of centers
in the third layer, makes parallel implementation possible. As a result the
algorithm speed will increase. The presented algorithm was tested on a standard
dataset (BSDS 300) of images, and the region boundaries were compared with
different people segmentation contours. Results show the efficiency of the
algorithm and its improvement to similar methods. As an instance, in 70% of
tested images, results are better than ACT algorithm, besides in 100% of tested
images, we had better results in comparison with VSP algorithm.

theoretical variational approach that uses the height representation. This
novel Lagrangian formulation is presented first for a generic reparametrization
invariant geometric model, deriving its equilibrium condition equation, or
shape equation, and its linear and angular stress tensors, using the classical
Canham-Helfrich elastic bending energy for illustration. The robustness of the

and to the case of heterogenous lipid membranes, breaking reparametrization
invariance. In addition, a useful and compact general expression for the second
variation of the free energy is obtained within the Lagrangian formulation, as
a first step towards the study of the stability of membrane configurations. The
simple structure of the expressions derived for the basic entities that appear
in the mechanics of a lipid membrane is a direct consequence of the well
established power of a Lagrangian variational approach. The paper is
self-contained, and it is meant to provide, besides a new framework, also a

macroscopic temperature equation recovered from the standard thermal LB
equation, are eliminated in the present model through a way that is consistent
with the philosophy of the LB method. In addition, the discrete effect of the
source term is also eliminated in the present model. Numerical simulations are
performed for droplet evaporation and bubble nucleation to validate the
capability of the improved model for simulating liquid-vapor phase change.
Numerical comparisons show that the aforementioned replacement leads to
significant numerical errors and the error terms in the recovered macroscopic

detection, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks for learning the
hidden representations of individual rumor-related tweets to gain insights on
the credibility of each tweets. We then aggregate the predictions from the very
beginning of a rumor to obtain the overall event credits (so-called wisdom),
and finally combine it with a time series based rumor classification model. Our
extensive experiments show a clearly improved classification performance within
the critical very first hours of a rumor. For a better understanding, we also
conduct an extensive feature evaluation that emphasized on the early stage and
shows that the low-level credibility has best predictability at all phases of

Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) shows that, unlike the two already-known
quasars, the i-z and z-y colors of the last six candidates are consistent with
M- or L-type brown dwarfs. Therefore, the quasar luminosity function (QLF) in
the previous paper is confirmed. Compiling QLF measurements from the literature
over a wide magnitude range, including an extremely faint AGN candidate from
Parsa et al. (2017}, to fit them with a double power-law, we find that the
best-fit faint-end slope is alpha=-2.04^+0.33_-0.18 (-1.98^+0.48_-0.21) and
characteristic magnitude is M_1450^*=-25.8^+1.1_-1.9 (-25.7^+1.0_-1.8) in the
case of two (one) quasar detection. Our result suggests that, if the QLF is
integrated down to M_1450=-18, quasars produce ~1-12% of the ionizing photons
required to ionize the whole universe at z~6 with 2sigma confidence level,
assuming that the escape fraction is f_esc=1 and the IGM clumpy factor is C=3.
Even when the systematic uncertainties are taken into account, our result
supports the scenario that quasars are the minor contributors of reionization.

problem in biology. Theoretical models of speciation have addressed this
question in the macroecological scale, but little has been investigated in the
macroevolutionary context. Knowledge of the evolutionary history allows the
study of patterns underlying the processes considered in these models,
revealing their signatures and the role of speciation and extinction in shaping
macroevolutionary patterns. In this paper we introduce two algorithms to record
the evolutionary history of populations in individual-based models of
speciation, from which genealogies and phylogenies can be constructed. The
first algorithm relies on saving ancestral-descendant relationships, generating
a matrix that contains the times to the most recent common ancestor between all
pairs of individuals at every generation (the Most Recent Common Ancestor Time
matrix, MRCAT). The second algorithm directly records all speciation and
extinction events throughout the evolutionary process, generating a matrix with
the true phylogeny of species (the Sequential Speciation and Extinction Events,
SSEE). We illustrate the use of these algorithms in a spatially explicit
individual-based model of speciation. We compare the trees generated via MRCAT
and SSEE algorithms with trees inferred by methods that use only genetic
distance among extant species, commonly used in empirical studies and applied
here to simulated genetic data. Comparisons between tress are performed with
metrics describing the overall topology, branch length distribution and
imbalance of trees. We observe that both MRCAT and distance-based trees differ
from the true phylogeny, with the first being closer to the true tree than the
second.

it using Neptune's bulk carbon abundance, D/H ratio, and interior structure

quantum materials, subtle variations in atomic-scale interactions can induce
dramatic changes in macroscopic properties and drive phase transitions. Despite
their importance, the mesoscale processes underpinning phase transitions often
remain elusive because of the vast differences in timescales between atomic and
electronic changes and thermodynamic transformations. Here, we photoinduce and
directly observe with x-ray scattering an ultrafast enhancement of the
structural long-range order in the archetypal Mott system V2O3. Despite the
ultrafast change in crystal symmetry, the change of unit cell volume occurs an
order of magnitude slower and coincides with the insulator-to-metal transition.
The decoupling between the two structural responses in the time domain
highlights the existence of a transient photoinduced precursor phase, which is
distinct from the two structural phases present in equilibrium. X-ray nanoscopy
reveals that acoustic phonons trapped in nanoscale blocks govern the dynamics
of the ultrafast transition into the precursor phase, while nucleation and
growth of metallic domains dictate the duration of the slower transition into
the metallic phase. The enhancement of the long-range order before completion
of the electronic transition demonstrates the critical role the non-equilibrium
structural phases play during electronic phase transitions in correlated

been one of the important challenges in black holes physics during the past

namely reentrant phase transition, by employing the Ruppeiner geometry.
Interestingly enough, we observe two properties for the phase behaviour of
small black holes that leads to reentrant phase transition. They are correlated
and they are of the interaction type. For the range of pressure in which the
system underlies reentrant phase transition, it transits from large black holes
phase to small one which possesses higher correlation than the other ranges of
pressures. On the other hand, the type of interaction between small black holes
near large/small transition line, differs for usual and reentrant phase
transitions. Indeed, for usual case, the dominant interaction is repulsive
whereas for reentrant case we encounter with an attractive interaction. We show
that in reentrant phase transition case, the small black holes behave like a
Bosonic gas whereas in the usual phase transition case, they behave like a
quantum anyon gas.

applications, particularly in-body and medical diagnostics devices. However,
future advanced SE miniature devices will require high-density, extremely
stretchable interconnects with micron-scale footprints, which calls for proven
standardized (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-type) process
recipes using bulk integrated circuit (IC) microfabrication tools and
fine-pitch photolithography patterning. Here, we address this combined
challenge of microfabrication with extreme stretchability for high-density SE
devices by introducing CMOS-enabled, free-standing, miniaturized interconnect
structures that fully exploit their 3D kinematic freedom through an interplay
of buckling, torsion, and bending to maximize stretchability. Integration with
standard CMOS-type batch processing is assured by utilizing the Flex-to-Rigid
(F2R) post-processing technology to make the back-end-of-line interconnect
structures free-standing, thus enabling the routine microfabrication of
highly-stretchable interconnects. The performance and reproducibility of these
free-standing structures is promising: an elastic stretch beyond 2000% and
ultimate (plastic) stretch beyond 3000%, with <0.3% resistance change, and >10
million cycles at 1000% stretch with <1% resistance change. This generic
technology provides a new route to exciting highly-stretchable miniature
devices.

post-processed with RADMC3D and the ALMA Observation Simulator. We found that
even though the CPDs are too small to be resolved, they are hot due to the
accreting planet in the optically thick limit, therefore the best chance to
detect them with continuum observations in this case is at the shortest ALMA
wavelengths, such as Band 9 (440 microns). Similar fluxes were found in the
case of Saturn and Jupiter-mass planets, as for the 10 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$
gas-giant, due to temperature weighted optical depth effects: when no deep gap
is carved, the planet region is blanketed by the optically thick circumstellar
disk leading to a less efficient cooling there. A test was made for a 52 AU
orbital separation, showed that optically thin CPDs are also detectable in band
7 but they need longer integration times ($>$5hrs). Comparing the gap profiles
of the same simulation at various ALMA bands and the hydro simulation confirmed
that they change significantly, first because the gap is wider at longer
wavelengths due to decreasing optical depth; second, the beam convolution makes
the gap shallower and at least 25% narrower. Therefore, caution has to be made
when estimating planet masses based on ALMA continuum observations of gaps.

To access the information conveyed by the cross-correlation signal its accurate
theoretical description is required. We compute the bias to CMB lensing-galaxy
shape cross-correlation measurements induced by nonlinear structure growth.
Using tree-level perturbation theory for the large-scale structure bispectrum
we find that the bias is negative on most angular scales, therefore mimicking
the signal of intrinsic alignments. Combining Euclid-like galaxy lensing data
with a CMB experiment comparable to the Planck satellite mission the bias
becomes significant only on smallest scales ($\ell\gtrsim 2500$). For improved
CMB observations, however, the corrections amount to 10-15 per cent of the CMB
lensing-intrinsic alignment signal over a wide multipole range ($10 \lesssim
\ell \lesssim 2000$). Accordingly the power spectrum bias, if uncorrected,
translates into $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ errors in the determination of the

between their boundaries and the swimmers. In this paper, we propose a
kinetic-type model to study swimming and directional migration of microscale
bimetallic rods in a periodic array of posts with non-circular cross-sections.
Both rod position and orientation are taken into account; rod trapping and
release on the post boundaries are modeled by empirically characterizing
curvature and orientational dependence of the boundary absorption and
desorption. Intensity of the directed rod migration, which we call the
normalized net flux, is then defined and computed given the geometry of the
post array. We numerically study the effect of post spacings on the flux; we
also apply shape optimization to find better post shapes that can induce
stronger flux. Inspired by preliminary numerical results on two candidate
posts, we perform an approximate analysis on a simplified model to show the key
geometric features a good post should have. Based on that, three new candidate
shapes are proposed which give rise to large fluxes. This approach provides an
effective tool and guidance for experimentally designing new devices that

temperature in a certain parameter range set by two boundaries separating the
skyrmion state from the uniform AFM phase and a stripe domain phase. The
distribution of the energy barriers for the AFM skyrmion decay into the uniform

that the skyrmion stability region is significantly narrowed at finite

application of magnetic field, whose strength is comparable to the spin-flop

sharp contrast to the behavior of their ferromagnetic counterparts.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the AFM skyrmions are stable on timescales of
milliseconds below 50 K for realistic material parameters, making it feasible
to observe them in modern experiments.

A novel aspect is that we use the phase volume as the argument of the

facilitates the solution. The publicly available code, PhaseFlow, implements a
high-accuracy finite-element method for the Fokker-Planck equation, and can
handle multiple-component systems, optionally with the central black hole and
taking into account loss-cone effects and star formation. We discuss the energy
balance in the general setting, and in application to the Bahcall-Wolf cusp
around a central black hole, for which we derive a perturbative solution. We
stress that the cusp is not a steady-state structure, but rather evolves in
amplitude while retaining an approximately $\rho\propto r^{-7/4}$ density
profile. Finally, we apply the method to the nuclear star cluster of the Milky
Way, and illustrate a possible evolutionary scenario in which a two-component
system of lighter main-sequence stars and stellar-mass black holes develops a
Bahcall-Wolf cusp in the heavier component and a weaker $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$
cusp in the lighter, visible component, over the period of several Gyr. The
present-day density profile is consistent with the recently detected mild cusp

easily identified on the basis of mid-infrared (MIR) colors and SEDs. Using
samples of SDSS type 1 type 2 matched in redshift and [OIII] luminosity, we
produce composite rest-frame 0.2-15 micron SEDs based on SDSS, UKIDSS, and
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometry and perform model fits

contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce
substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN
torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the UV-IR broadband
photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10% of the fitted galaxies host
an AGN contributing $>$10% of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We
demonstrate the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First,
we compare observed spectral features to spectral features predicted from our
model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves
predictions for observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosities, as well as
mid-infrared Akari and Spitzer/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of
the AGN component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and
dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the strength
of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators,
suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46% of the
SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection. Based on
these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data without AGN
components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters.

mild evolution from z~2 to z~6. LAEs with the highest rest-frame equivalent
widths (EW) are the smallest/most compact (re~0.8 kpc, compared to re~1.5 kpc

luminosity and Lya EW we find evidence for redshift evolution in n and C, but
not in galaxy sizes. The evolution seems to be stronger for LAEs with 25<EW<100

from a factor of ~1 at z>5 to SFGs being a factor of ~2-4 larger than LAEs for

high Lya escape fraction) should be much higher, consistent with observations.

counterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of
quantum information theory. However, standard error correction refers to
abstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the
physical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There
are, however, other forms of information that are physical - one of the most
ubiquitous being reference frame information. Here we analyze the problem of
error correcting physical information. The basic question we seek to answer is
whether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations
govern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for
transmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them,
must necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that
obey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the
case of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to
quantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go
theorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes
exist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and
SO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using
infinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant
quantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1).
Finally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes,
giving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction

dynamics have distinct power law tails. The Green's functions show a short time
""quasi"" Markovian exponential decay before crossing over to a power law tail
governed by the non-analyticity of the spectral function. We study a system of
bosons (fermions) hopping on a one dimensional lattice, where each site is
coupled linearly to an independent bath of non-interacting bosons (fermions).
We obtain exact expressions for the Green's functions of this system which show
power law decay $\sim |t-t'|^{-3/2}$. We use these to calculate density and
current profile, as well as unequal time current-current correlators. While the
density and current profiles show interesting quantitative deviations from
Markovian results, the current-current correlators show qualitatively distinct
long time power law tails $|t-t'|^{-3}$ characteristic of non-Markovian
dynamics. We show that the power law decays survive in presence of
inter-particle interaction in the system, but the cross-over time scale is
shifted to larger values with increasing interaction strength.

best scenario for a direct observation of a metal-free stellar population is a
merger between two Population III galaxies. In mergers between metal-enriched

indirectly. Single Population III galaxies are too dim to be observed
photometrically at $z = 15$. Ly$\alpha$ emission is discernible by $JWST$ as an

range of morphologies. Since we focus on extended galaxies
($r_\mathrm{eff}=2.5$-$14^{\prime\prime}$), our sample is likely dominated by
low-redshift objects. We define LSBGs to have mean surface brightnesses
$\bar{\mu}_\mathrm{eff}(g)>24.3$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, which allows nucleated
galaxies into our sample. As a result, the central surface brightness
distribution spans a wide range of $\mu_0(g)=18$-$27.4$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, with
50% and 95% of galaxies fainter than 24.3 and 22 mag arcsec$^{-2}$,
respectively. Furthermore, the surface brightness distribution is a strong
function of color, with the red distribution being much broader and generally
fainter than that of the blue LSBGs, and this trend shows a clear correlation
with galaxy morphology. Red LSBGs typically have smooth light profiles that are
well-characterized by single-component S\'{e}rsic functions. In contrast, blue
LSBGs tend to have irregular morphologies and show evidence for ongoing star
formation. We crossmatch our sample with existing optical, HI, and ultraviolet
catalogs to gain insight into the physical nature of the LSBGs. We find that
our sample is diverse, ranging from dwarf spheroidals and ultra-diffuse
galaxies in nearby groups to gas-rich irregulars to giant LSB spirals,

persistent conductance distribution patterns. In particular, in the presence of
MZMs, the conductance peak spacings of the Coulomb blockaded junction would
manifest line crossings as the magnetic flux varies. The locations of the line

nonconserved particle number, non-trivial braiding statistics, and the absence
of a noninteracting limit. We deviate from this description and instead
consider a gas of noninteracting, spin-1/2 Majorana fermions that obey the
spin-statistics theorem via imposing a condensed matter analog of momentum
conservation. This allows us to build a quantum statistical theory of the
Majorana system in the low temperature, low density limit without the need to
account for strong fluctuations in the particle number. A combinatorial
analysis leads to a configurational entropy which deviates from the fermionic
result with an increasing number of available microstates. A number-conserving
Majorana distribution function is derived which shows signatures of a
sharply-defined Fermi surface at finite temperatures. Such a distribution is
then re-derived from a microscopic model in the form of a modified Kitaev chain
with a bosonic pair interaction. The thermodynamics of this free Majorana
system is found to be nearly identical to that of a free Fermi gas, except now
distinguished by a two-fold ground state degeneracy and, subsequently, a
residual entropy at zero temperature. Despite clear differences with the
anyonic or Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, we nevertheless find surprising agreement
between our theory and experimental signatures of Majorana excitations in
several materials. Experimental realization of our exactly solvable model is
also discussed in the realm of astrophysical and high-energy phenomena.

include the Bi-based half-Heusler materials, which have recently been
established as low-temperature and low-carrier density superconductors.
Motivated by this experimental observation, we obtain a comprehensive
symmetry-based classification of topological pairing states in systems with
higher angular momentum Cooper pairing. Our study consists of two main parts.
First, we develop the phenomenological theory of multicomponent (i.e., higher
angular momentum) pairing by classifying the stationary points of the free
energy within a Ginzburg-Landau framework. Based on the symmetry classification
of stationary pairing states, we then derive the symmetry-imposed constraints
on their gap structures. We find that, depending on the symmetry quantum
numbers of the Cooper pairs, different types of topological pairing states can
occur: fully gapped topological superconductors in class DIII, Dirac
superconductors and superconductors hosting Majorana fermions. Notably, we find
a series of nematic fully gapped topological superconductors, as well as
double-Dirac superconductors with quadratic dispersion. Our approach, applied
here to the case of $j=\frac{3}{2}$ Cooper pairing, is rooted in the symmetry
properties of pairing states, and can therefore also be applied to other
systems with higher angular momentum and high-spin pairing. We conclude by
relating our results to experimentally accessible signatures in thermodynamic

cosmic voids limits our ability to extract valuable cosmological information
from their study. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the
spherically compensated cosmic regions, named CoSpheres. Such cosmic regions
are identified around local extrema in the density field and admit a unique
compensation radius $R_1$ where the internal spherical mass is exactly
compensated. Their origin is studied by extending the standard peak model and
implementing the compensation condition. Since the compensation radius evolves
as the Universe itself, $R_1(t)\propto a(t)$, CoSpheres behave as bubble
Universes with fixed comoving volume. Using the spherical collapse model, we
reconstruct their profiles with a very high accuracy until $z=0$ in N-body
simulations. CoSpheres are symmetrically defined and reconstructed for both
central maximum (seeding haloes and galaxies) and minimum (identified with
cosmic voids). We show that the full non linear dynamics can be solved
analytically around this particular compensation radius, providing useful
predictions for cosmology. This formalism highlights original correlations
between local extremum and their large scale cosmic environment. The
statistical properties of these spherically compensated cosmic regions and the
possibilities to constrain efficiently both cosmology and gravity will be
investigated in companion papers.

into two triplet excitons residing on neighboring molecules, is a promising
route to improving organic photovoltaic (OPV) device efficiencies by harvesting
two charge carriers from one photon. However, only a few materials have been
discovered that exhibit intermolecular SF in the solid state, most of which are
acene derivatives. Recently, there has been a growing interest in rylenes as
potential SF materials. We use many-body perturbation theory in the GW
approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to investigate the
possibility of intermolecular SF in crystalline perylene and quaterrylene. A
new method is presented for determining the percent charge transfer character
(%CT) of an exciton wave-function from double-Bader analysis. This enables
relating exciton probability distributions to crystal packing. Based on
comparison to known and predicted SF materials with respect to the energy
conservation criterion (ES-2ET) and %CT, crystalline quaterrylene is a
promising candidate for intermolecular SF. Furthermore, quaterrylene is
attractive for OPV applications thanks to its high stability and narrow optical
gap. Perylene is not expected to exhibit SF, however it is a promising
candidate for harvesting sub-gap photons by triplet-triplet annihilation.

a conjecture of Bilu. We include two applications of these results. The first

Sobolev topology) of regular initial data that are close to the data of a
simple plane wave, we give a sharp, constructive proof of shock formation in
which the transport variable remains bounded but its first-order Cartesian
coordinate partial derivatives blow up in finite time. Moreover, we prove that
the singularity does not propagate into the symmetric hyperbolic variables:
they and their first-order Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives remain
bounded, even though they interact with the transport variable all the way up
to its singularity. The formation of the singularity is tied to the finite-time
degeneration, relative to the Cartesian coordinates, of a system of geometric
coordinates adapted to the characteristics of the transport operator. Two
crucial features of the proof are that relative to the geometric coordinates,
all solution variables remain smooth, and that the finite-time degeneration
coincides with the intersection of the characteristics. Compared to prior shock
formation results in more than one spatial dimension, in which the blowup
occurred in solutions to wave equations, the main new features of the present
work are: i) we develop a theory of nonlinear geometric optics for transport
operators, which is compatible with the coupling and which allows us to
implement a quasilinear geometric vectorfield method, even though the
regularity properties of the corresponding eikonal function are less favorable

integrated photonics. The creation of such low-noise laser sources is critical
for emerging on-chip applications, ranging from coherent optical
communications, photonic microwave oscillators remote sensing and optical
rotational sensors. While Brillouin lasers are a promising solution to these
challenges, new strategies are needed to create robust, compact, low power and
low cost Brillouin laser technologies through wafer-scale integration. To date,
chip-scale Brillouin lasers have remained elusive due to the difficulties in
realization of these lasers on a commercial integration platform. In this
paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, monolithically integrated Brillouin
lasers using a wafer-scale process based on an ultra-low loss Si3N4/SiO2
waveguide platform. Cascading of stimulated Brillouin lasing to 10 Stokes
orders was observed in an integrated bus-coupled resonator with a loaded Q
factor exceeding 28 million. We experimentally quantify the laser performance,
including threshold, slope efficiency and cascading dynamics, and compare the
results with theory. The large mode volume integrated resonator and gain medium
supports a TE-only resonance and unique 2.72 GHz free spectral range, essential
for high performance integrated Brillouin lasing. The laser is based on a
non-acoustic guiding design that supplies a broad Brillouin gain bandwidth.
Characteristics for high performance lasing are demonstrated due to large
intra-cavity optical power and low lasing threshold power. Consistent laser
performance is reported for multiple chips across multiple wafers. This design
lends itself to wafer-scale integration of practical high-yield, highly
coherent Brillouin lasers on a chip.

a linear barotropic equation of state $p=\alpha \rho$ but this leads to an
intractable differential equation. Next we consider the neutral isothermal
metric of Saslaw, Maharaj and Dadhich (1996) in an electric field and the usual
inverse square law of energy density and pressure results thus preserving the
equation of state. Additionally, we discard a linear equation of state and
endeavour to find new classes of solutions with the inverse square law fall off
of density. Certain prescribed forms of the spatial and temporal gravitational
forms result in new exact solutions. An interesting result that emerges is that
while isothermal fluid spheres are unbounded in the neutral case, this is not
so when charge is involved. Indeed it was found that barotropic equations of
state exist and hypersurfaces of vanishing pressure exist establishing a
boundary in practically all models. One model was studied in depth and found to
satisfy other elementary requirements for physical admissability such as a
subluminal sound speed as well as gravitational surface redshifts smaller than

scans. As the target often occupies a relatively small region in the input
image, deep neural networks can be easily confused by the complex and variable
background. To alleviate this, researchers proposed a coarse-to-fine approach,
which used prediction from the first (coarse) stage to indicate a smaller input
region for the second (fine) stage. Despite its effectiveness, this algorithm
dealt with two stages individually, which lacked optimizing a global energy
function, and limited its ability to incorporate multi-stage visual cues.
Missing contextual information led to unsatisfying convergence in iterations,
and that the fine stage sometimes produced even lower segmentation accuracy
than the coarse stage.
  This paper presents a Recurrent Saliency Transformation Network. The key
innovation is a saliency transformation module, which repeatedly converts the
segmentation probability map from the previous iteration as spatial weights and
applies these weights to the current iteration. This brings us two-fold
benefits. In training, it allows joint optimization over the deep networks
dealing with different input scales. In testing, it propagates multi-stage
visual information throughout iterations to improve segmentation accuracy.
Experiments in the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset demonstrate the
state-of-the-art accuracy, which outperforms the previous best by an average of
over 2%. Much higher accuracies are also reported on several small organs in a
larger dataset collected by ourselves. In addition, our approach enjoys better
convergence properties, making it more efficient and reliable in practice.

stellar evolutionary phases, as well as to search for signs of tidal
disturbance from the MW, which would indicate departure from dynamical
equilibrium. We perform the most accurate structural analysis to-date of
Sextans' stellar components by applying Bayesian MCMC methods to the individual
stars' positions. Surface density maps are built by decontaminating the sample
through a matched filter analysis of the CMD, and then analysed for departures
from axisymmetry. Sextans is found to be considerably less spatially extended
than early studies suggested. No significant distortions or tidal disturbances
are found down to a surface brightness of $\sim$ 31.8 mag/arcsec$^{-2}$ in
V-band. We identify an overdensity in the central regions that may correspond
to previously reported kinematic substructure(s). In agreement with previous
findings, old $\&$ metal-poor stars such as BHB stars cover a much larger area
than stars in other evolutionary phases, and bright BSs are less spatially
extended than faint ones. However, the different spatial distribution of bright
and faint BSs appears consistent with the general age/metallicity gradients
found in Sextans' stellar component. This is compatible with BSs having formed
by evolution of binaries and not necessarily due to the presence of a central
disrupted globular cluster, as suggested in the literature. We provide
structural parameters for the various populations analyzed and make publicly

an effective photon-photon interaction identical to that for electrons in BCS

this scenario, photons may exchange energy without matching a quantum of
vibration of the medium. As a result, pair correlations for photons scattered

formation of the bulge of our Galaxy. We use the semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation and evolution SAG adapted to this aim; this kind of models can trace
the properties of galaxies and their components like stellar discs, bulges and
halos, but resolution limits prevent them from reaching the scale of stellar
populations (SPs). Properties of groups of stars formed during single star
formation events are stored and tracked in the model and results are compared
with observations of stars in the galactic bulge. MW-like galaxies are selected
using two different criteria. One of them considers intrinsic photo-metric
properties and the second is focused on the cosmological context of the local
group of galaxies (LG). We compare our model results with spectroscopic and
photometric stellar metallicity distributions. We find that 87% of stars in
bulges of MWtype galaxies in our model are accreted and formed in starbursts
during disc instability events. Mergers contribute to 13% of the mass budget of
the bulge and are responsible for the low metallicity tail of the distribution.
Abundance ratios of {\alpha} elements with respect to iron, [{\alpha}/Fe], are
measured in SPs of model galaxies. The patterns found in the model for SPs with
different origins help to explain the lack of a gradient of [{\alpha}/Fe]
ratios in observed stars along the minor axis of the bulge.

presence of a passive eavesdropper. An authorized user estimates the state of

the packets may also be intercepted by the eavesdropper. Our goal is to design
a coding scheme at the sensor, which encodes the state information, in order to
impair the eavesdropper's estimation performance, while enabling the user to
successfully decode the sent messages. We introduce a novel class of codes,
termed State-Secrecy Codes, which use acknowledgment signals from the user and
apply linear time-varying transformations to the current and previously
received states. By exploiting the properties of the system's process noise,
the channel physical model and the dynamics, these codes manage to be fast,
efficient and, thus, suitable for real-time dynamical systems. We prove that
under minimal conditions, State-Secrecy Codes achieve perfect secrecy, namely
the eavesdropper's estimation error grows unbounded almost surely, while the
user's estimation performance is optimal. These conditions only require that at
least once, the user receives the corresponding packet while the eavesdropper
fails to intercept it. Even one occurrence of this event renders the
eavesdropper's error unbounded with asymptotically optimal rate of increase.
State-Secrecy Codes are provided and studied for two cases, i) when direct
state measurements are available, and ii) when we only have output
measurements. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulations.

IRIS. The associated flare ribbon contained a quasi-periodic sawtooth pattern
that was observed to propagate along the ribbon, perpendicular to the IRIS
spectral slit, with a phase velocity of $\sim 15$ km s$^{-1}$. This motion
resulted in periodicities in both intensity and Doppler velocity along the
slit. These periodicities were reported to be approximately $\pm0.5$ arcseconds
in position and $\pm20$ km s$^{-1}$ in velocity and were measured to be
$\sim180^{\circ}$ out of phase with one another. This quasi-periodic behavior
has been attributed by others to bursty or patchy reconnection and slipping
occurring during three-dimensional magnetic reconnection. While able to account
for periodicities in both intensity and Doppler velocity these suggestions do
not explicitly account for the phase velocity of the entire sawtooth structure,
or for the relative phasing of the oscillations. Here we propose that the
observations can be explained by a tearing mode instability occurring at a
current sheet across which there is also a velocity shear. Using a linear model
of this instability we reproduce the relative phase of the oscillations, as
well as the phase velocity of the sawtooth structure. We suggest a geometry and
local plasma parameters for the April 18 flare which would support our
hypothesis. Under this proposal the combined spectral and spatial IRIS
observations of this flare may provide the most compelling evidence to date of
a tearing mode occurring in the solar magnetic field.

represents a fundamental task in quantum information science. At its most
basic, it concerns a state of a bipartite quantum system whose subsystems are
subjected to local operations. We compare two different methods for obtaining
the original state from the state resulting from the action of these
operations. The first method involves quantum operations called Petz recovery
maps, acting locally on the two subsystems. The second method is called matrix
(or state) reconstruction and involves local, linear maps which are not
necessarily completely positive. Moreover, we compare the quantities on which
the maps employed in the two methods depend. We show that any state which
admits Petz recovery also admits state reconstruction. However, the latter is
successful for a strictly larger set of states. We also compare these methods
in the context of a finite spin chain. Here, the state of a finite spin chain
is reconstructed from the reduced states of a few neighbouring spins. In this
setting, state reconstruction is the same as the MPO (i.e. matrix product
operator) reconstruction proposed by Baumgratz et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,
020401 (2013)]. Finally, we generalize both these methods so that they employ
long-range measurements instead of relying solely on short-range correlations
embodied in such local reduced states. Long-range measurements enable the
reconstruction of states which cannot be reconstructed from measurements of
local few-body observables alone and hereby we improve existing methods for
quantum state tomography of quantum many-body systems.

eq}$ $>1000$ K are significantly larger than expected, is an open question and
the subject of many proposed explanations. Rather than examine these models
individually, this work seeks to characterize the anomalous heating as a
function of incident flux, $\epsilon(F)$, needed to inflate the population of
planets to their observed sizes. We then compare that result to theoretical
predictions for various models. We examine the population of about 300 giant
planets with well-determined masses and radii and apply thermal evolution and
Bayesian statistical models to infer the anomalous power as a function of
incident flux that best reproduces the observed radii. First, we observe that
the inflation of planets below about $M=0.5 \;\rm{M}_\rm{J}$ appears very
different than their higher mass counterparts, perhaps as the result of mass
loss or an inefficient heating mechanism. As such, we exclude planets below
this threshold. Next, we show with strong significance that $\epsilon(F)$
increases with $T_{\rm{eq}}$ towards a maximum of $\sim 2.5\%$ at $T_{\rm{eq}}
\approx 1500$ K, and then decreases as temperatures increase further, falling
to $\sim0.2\%$ at $T_\rm{eff}= 2500$ K. This high-flux decrease in inflation
efficiency was predicted by the Ohmic dissipation model of giant planet
inflation but not other models. We also explicitly check the thermal tides
model and find that it predicts far more variance in radii than is observed.
Thus, our results provide evidence for the Ohmic dissipation model and a
functional form for $\epsilon(F)$ that any future theories of hot Jupiter radii
can be tested against.

$33.7\pm18.0$ $\mu{\rm G}$. The critical mass of FeSt 1-457, evaluated using
both magnetic and thermal/turbulent support is ${M}_{\rm cr} = 3.70\pm0.92$

depending on the data distribution, a high or low value for mpts may be more
appropriate, and certain data clusters may reveal themselves at different
values of mpts. To explore results for a range of mpts values, however, one has
to run HDBSCAN* for each value in the range independently, which is
computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to
compute all HDBSCAN* hierarchies for a range of mpts values by replacing the
graph used by HDBSCAN* with a much smaller graph that is guaranteed to contain
the required information. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that with
our approach one can obtain over one hundred hierarchies for the computational
cost equivalent to running HDBSCAN* about 2 times.

optimization performance than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in some
scenarios. However, recent studies show that they often lead to worse

worse than SGD, and develop a variant of Adam to eliminate the generalization

enables more precise control of the direction and step size for updating weight

Following a similar rationale, we further improve the generalization

bridging the gap between SGD and Adam, we also hope to shed light on why
certain optimization algorithms generalize better than others.

illustrate that phylogeneticists have been ""spoiled"" in the sense of not having

strong assumption that evolution is treelike. We show that there are not always
good statistical reasons to prefer the usual class of treelike models over more
general convergence-divergence models. Specifically we show many $3$-taxon

clock due to change in the rate of evolution along different edges, or by
keeping the assumption of a constant rate of evolution but instead assuming
that evolution is not a purely divergent process. Given the abundance of

retaining fidelity to the descriptiveness needed at test time. In the linear

solved quickly and applied to test sets outside the context of the training

While the published experiments so far have been based on exploiting the

system for conversational AI based on linguistics has many advantages: passing
bAbI task tests without parsing or statistics while increasing scalability. Our
model validates both the training and test data to find 'garbage' input and

instead relies on meaning. While Deep Learning is difficult to debug and fix,
every step in our model can be understood and changed like any non-statistical
computer program. Deep Learning's lack of explicable reasoning has raised
opposition to AI, partly due to fear of the unknown. To support the goals of
AI, we propose extended tasks to use human-level statements with tense, aspect

language generation (NLG) instead of keywords. While machine learning permits
invalid training data to produce incorrect test responses, our system cannot

no existing learning systems can currently solve these extended natural

must resort to sample-based non-intrusive approaches [1]. In such cases,
minimizing the number of function evaluations required to evaluate the response
surface is of paramount importance. Sparse grid approaches have proven
effective in reducing the number of sample evaluations. For example, the
discrete projection collocation method has the notable feature of exhibiting
fast convergence rates when approximating smooth functions; however, it lacks
the ability to accurately and efficiently track response functions that exhibit
fluctuations, abrupt changes or discontinuities in very localized regions of
the input domain. On the other hand, the piecewise linear collocation
interpolation approach can track these localized variations in the response
surface efficiently, but it converges slowly in the smooth regions. The
proposed methodology, building on an existing work on adaptive hierarchical
sparse grid collocation algorithm [2], is able to track localized behavior
while also avoiding unnecessary function evaluations in smoother regions of the
stochastic space by using a finite difference based one-dimensional derivative
evaluation technique in all the dimensions. This derivative evaluation
technique leads to faster convergence in the smoother regions than what is
achieved in the existing collocation interpolation approaches. Illustrative
examples show that this method is well suited to high-dimensional stochastic
problems, and that stochastic elliptic problems with stochastic dimension as

details of these processes, especially with heavy and large anionic complexes,
are not well-understood. We studied the adsorption of $PtCl_6^{2-}$ anionic
complexes to floating DPTAP monolayers in the presence of excess $Cl^-$ as a
function of the bulk chlorometalate concentration. In situ x-ray scattering and
fluorescence measurements, which are element and depth sensitive, show that the
chlorometalate ions only adsorb in the diffuse layer at lower concentrations,
while they adsorb predominantly in the Stern layer at higher concentrations.
The response of DPTAP molecules to the adsorbed ions is determined
independently by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, and supports this
picture. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidate the nanoscale
structure of the interfacial complexes. The results suggest that ion hydration
and ion-ion correlations play a key role in the competitive adsorption process.

molecular networks of different species. NA can be local or global. Just as the
recent trend in the NA field, we also focus on global NA, which can be pairwise
(PNA) and multiple (MNA). PNA produces aligned node pairs between two networks.
MNA produces aligned node clusters between more than two networks. Recently,
the focus has shifted from PNA to MNA, because MNA captures conserved regions
between more networks than PNA (and MNA is thus considered to be more
insightful), though at higher computational complexity. The issue is that, due
to the different outputs of PNA and MNA, a PNA method is only compared to other
PNA methods, and an MNA method is only compared to other MNA methods.
Comparison of PNA against MNA must be done to evaluate whether MNA's higher
complexity is justified by its higher accuracy. We introduce a framework that
allows for this. We evaluate eight prominent PNA and MNA methods, on synthetic
and real-world biological networks, using topological and functional alignment
quality measures. We compare PNA against MNA in both a pairwise (native to PNA)
and multiple (native to MNA) manner. PNA is expected to perform better under
the pairwise evaluation framework. Indeed this is what we find. MNA is expected
to perform better under the multiple evaluation framework. Shockingly, we find
this not to always hold; PNA is often better than MNA in this framework,
depending on the choice of evaluation test.

the optimal stationary policy for the sampled model for the rest of the

expected regret under a Bayesian setting, where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of

should be trained without seeing occlusions while being able to transfer the
learned knowledge to deal with occlusions. This setting alleviates the
difficulty in collecting an exponentially large dataset to cover occlusion
patterns and is more essential. In this scenario, the proposal-based deep
networks, like RCNN-series, often produce unsatisfactory results, because both
the proposal extraction and classification stages may be confused by the
irrelevant occluders. To address this, [25] proposed a voting mechanism that
combines multiple local visual cues to detect semantic parts. The semantic
parts can still be detected even though some visual cues are missing due to
occlusions. However, this method is manually-designed, thus is hard to be
optimized in an end-to-end manner.
  In this paper, we present DeepVoting, which incorporates the robustness shown
by [25] into a deep network, so that the whole pipeline can be jointly
optimized. Specifically, it adds two layers after the intermediate features of
a deep network, e.g., the pool-4 layer of VGGNet. The first layer extracts the
evidence of local visual cues, and the second layer performs a voting mechanism
by utilizing the spatial relationship between visual cues and semantic parts.
We also propose an improved version DeepVoting+ by learning visual cues from
context outside objects. In experiments, DeepVoting achieves significantly
better performance than several baseline methods, including Faster-RCNN, for
semantic part detection under occlusion. In addition, DeepVoting enjoys
explainability as the detection results can be diagnosed via looking up the
voting cues.

this transition. The transition temperature $T_c$ and the orientation of the
in-plane intrinsic electric dipole can be controlled by moderate uniaxial
tensile strain, and a modified discrete clock model describes the transition on
strained samples. These results establish a general underlying theoretical
background to understand structural phase transitions in 2D materials and their
effects on material properties.

discontinuities poses major computational challenges in analyzing and
quantifying the effects of the uncertainties in a physical system. In this
paper, we propose a stochastic collocation method with adaptive mesh refinement
(SCAMR) to deal with high dimensional stochastic systems with discontinuities.
Specifically, the proposed approach uses generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)
expansion with Legendre polynomial basis and solves for the gPC coefficients
using the least squares method. It also implements an adaptive mesh (element)
refinement strategy which checks for abrupt variations in the output based on
the second order gPC approximation error to track discontinuities or
non-smoothness. In addition, the proposed method involves a criterion for
checking possible dimensionality reduction and consequently, the decomposition
of the full-dimensional problem to a number of lower-dimensional subproblems.
Specifically, this criterion checks all the existing interactions between input
dimensions of a specific problem based on the high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) method, and therefore automatically provides the
subproblems which only involve interacting dimensions. The efficiency of the
approach is demonstrated using both smooth and non-smooth function examples
with input dimensions up to 300, and the approach is compared against other
existing algorithms.

imposing a network model on a given graph, or optimizing a designed objective

SGC-GEN incorporates the predictability on correct community detection with a

functions and model mismatch metrics. We further establish a theoretical
condition for correct community detection using the normalized graph Laplacian

mechanism requires fixed aspect ratios and limits the cropping region with
arbitrary size. Moreover, the sliding window method usually produces tens of
thousands of windows on the input image which is very time-consuming. Motivated
by these challenges, we firstly formulate the aesthetic image cropping as a
sequential decision-making process and propose a weakly supervised Aesthetics

Particularly, the proposed method develops an aesthetics aware reward function
which especially benefits image cropping. Similar to human's decision making,
we use a comprehensive state representation including both the current
observation and the historical experience. We train the agent using the
actor-critic architecture in an end-to-end manner. The agent is evaluated on
several popular unseen cropping datasets. Experiment results show that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with much fewer candidate

states in which the majority of the charge density resides on the Peierls

developers should always keep up to date with the latest versions of their

empirical study on library migration that covers over 4,600 GitHub software
projects and 2,700 library dependencies. Results show that although many of
these systems rely heavily on dependencies, 81.5% of the studied systems still
keep their outdated dependencies. In the case of updating a vulnerable
dependency, the study reveals that affected developers are not likely to
respond to a security advisory. Surveying these developers, we find that 69% of

Furthermore, developers are not likely to prioritize library updates, citing it
as extra effort and added responsibility. This study concludes that even though
third-party reuse is commonplace, the practice of updating a dependency is not

possible situations, a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) will face during
its operation, and hence, CAVs will need to learn to make decisions
autonomously. Due to the sensing of its surroundings and information exchanged
with other vehicles and road infrastructure, a CAV will have access to large
amounts of useful data. While different control algorithms have been proposed
for CAVs, the benefits brought about by connectedness of autonomous vehicles to
other vehicles and to the infrastructure, and its implications on policy
learning has not been investigated in literature. This paper investigates a
data driven driving policy learning framework through an agent-based modelling
approaches. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. A dynamic programming
framework is proposed for in-vehicle policy learning with and without
connectivity to neighboring vehicles. The simulation results indicate that
while a CAV can learn to make autonomous decisions, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communication of information improves this capability. Furthermore, to overcome
the limitations of sensing in a CAV, the paper proposes a novel concept for
infrastructure-led policy learning and communication with autonomous vehicles.
In infrastructure-led policy learning, road-side infrastructure senses and
captures successful vehicle maneuvers and learns an optimal policy from those
temporal sequences, and when a vehicle approaches the road-side unit, the
policy is communicated to the CAV. Deep-imitation learning methodology is
proposed to develop such an infrastructure-led policy learning framework.

topological odd-parity superfluidity in a spin-independent bond-centered square
optical lattice based upon interband fermion pairing. The D4 point-group
symmetry of the lattice protects a quadratic band crossing, which allows one to
prepare a Fermi surface of spin-up fermions with odd parity close to the
degeneracy point. In the presence of spin-down fermions with even parity
populating a different energetically well separated band, odd-parity pairing is
favored. Strikingly, as a necessary prerequisite for pairing both Fermi
surfaces can be tuned to match well. As a result, topological superfluid phases
emerge in the presence of merely s-wave interaction. Due to the Z2 symmetry of
these odd-parity superfluids, we infer their topological features simply from
the symmetry and the Fermi-surface topology as confirmed numerically.

  (Acknowledgement updating)",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual Question Answering (VQA) models should have both high robustness and
accuracy. Unfortunately, most of the current VQA research only focuses on
accuracy because there is a lack of proper methods to measure the robustness of
VQA models. There are two main modules in our algorithm. Given a natural
language question about an image, the first module takes the question as input
and then outputs the ranked basic questions, with similarity scores, of the
main given question. The second module takes the main question, image and these
basic questions as input and then outputs the text-based answer of the main
question about the given image. We claim that a robust VQA model is one, whose
performance is not changed much when related basic questions as also made
available to it as input. We formulate the basic questions generation problem
as a LASSO optimization, and also propose a large scale Basic Question Dataset
(BQD) and Rscore (novel robustness measure), for analyzing the robustness of
VQA models. We hope our BQD will be used as a benchmark for to evaluate the
robustness of VQA models, so as to help the community build more robust and
accurate VQA models.

impact of hosting repositories like maven on software development today.
Updating libraries is crucial, with recent studies highlighting the associated
vulnerabilities with aging OSS libraries. The decision to migrate to a newer
library can range from trivial (security threat) to complex (assessment of work
required to accommodate the changes). By leveraging the `wisdom of the software
repository crowd' we propose a simple and efficient approach to recommending
`consented' library updates. Our Software Universe Graph (SUG) models library
dependency and update information mined from super repositories to provide
different metrics and visualizations that aid in the update decision. To
evaluate, we first constructed a SUG from 188,951 nodes of 6,374 maven unique
artifacts. Then, we demonstrate how our metrics and visualizations are applied
through real-world examples. As an extension, we show how the SUG can compare
dependencies between different super repositories. From a sample of 100 GitHub
applications, our method found that on average 79% similar overlapping
dependencies combinations exist between the maven and github super repository
universes.

several groups are currently building Raman LIDARs to be installed on the two
sites. Raman LIDARs are devices composed of a powerful laser that shoots into
the atmosphere, a collector that gathers the backscattered light from molecules
and aerosols, a photo-sensor, an optical module that spectrally selects
wavelengths of interest, and a read--out system.Unlike currently used elastic
LIDARs, they can help reduce the systematic uncertainties of the molecular and
aerosol components of the atmosphere to <5% so that CTA can achieve its energy
resolution requirements of<10% uncertainty at 1 TeV.All the Raman LIDARs in
this work have design features that make them different than typical Raman
LIDARs used in atmospheric science and are characterized by large collecting
mirrors (2.5m2) and reduced acquisition time.They provide both multiple elastic

motivation for Raman LIDARs, the design and the status of advance of these

water. When decreasing the water depth, we observe a drastic transition between
weak turbulence at the weakest forcing and a solitonic regime at stronger
forcing. We characterize the transition between both states by studying their
Fourier Spectra. We also study the efficiency of energy transfer in the weak
turbulence regime. We report a loss of efficiency of angular transfer as the
dispersion of the wave is reduced until the system bifurcates into the

  JavaScript Ecosystem","Submitted 2017",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rise of user-contributed Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems
demonstrate their prevalence in the software engineering discipline. Libraries
work together by depending on each other across the ecosystem. From these
ecosystems emerges a minimized library called a micro-package. Micro- packages
become problematic when breaks in a critical ecosystem dependency ripples its
effects to unsuspecting users. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
micro-packages in the npm JavaScript ecosystem. Specifically, we conducted an
empirical in- vestigation with 169,964 JavaScript npm packages to understand
(i) the widespread phenomena of micro-packages, (ii) the size dependencies
inherited by a micro-package and (iii) the developer usage cost (ie., fetch,
install, load times) of using a micro-package. Results of the study find that
micro-packages form a significant portion of the npm ecosystem. Apart from the
ease of readability and comprehension, we show that some micro-packages have
long dependency chains and incur just as much usage costs as other npm
packages. We envision that this work motivates the need for developers to be
aware of how sensitive their third-party dependencies are to critical changes
in the software ecosystem.

research, Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was applied
to features extracted from network traffic data with the aim of accurately
identifying IoT device types from the white list. To train and evaluate
multi-class classifiers, we collected and manually labeled network traffic data
from 17 distinct IoT devices, representing nine types of IoT devices. Based on
the classification of 20 consecutive sessions and the use of majority rule, IoT
device types that are not on the white list were correctly detected as unknown
in 96% of test cases (on average), and white listed device types were correctly
classified by their actual types in 99% of cases. Some IoT device types were
identified quicker than others (e.g., sockets and thermostats were successfully
detected within five TCP sessions of connecting to the network). Perfect
detection of unauthorized IoT device types was achieved upon analyzing 110
consecutive sessions; perfect classification of white listed types required 346
consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99.49% accuracy. Further
experiments demonstrated the successful applicability of classifiers trained in

what the senses will report at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and
adapting synaptic weights to improve prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus
of the thalamus serves as a projection screen upon which predictions are
generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic inputs from multiple brain
areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving inputs from layer 5
intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and the temporal
difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout the cortex,
driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using only
local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed
biophysical model. In vision, predictive learning requires a
carefully-organized developmental progression and anatomical organization of
three pathways (What, Where, and What * Where), according to two central
principles: top-down input from compact, high-level, abstract representations
is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory inputs; and the
collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and
opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that
drive the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized
systematic invariant object representations of 100 different objects from

the Matrix Element Method (MEM) has been established in hadron collider

it has been found that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ parafermionic gapped phases can be
classified as topological phases, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases,
and a trivial phase, which are uniquely labelled by the divisors $n$ of $p$. In
the presence of TR symmetry, however, the enriched classification is
characterized by three indices $n$, $\kappa $ and $\mu $, where $\kappa \in
\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ denotes the linear or projective TR actions on the edges, and
$\mu \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ indicates the commutation relations between the TR and

parafermionic ground states, where $r=p$ for trivial or topological phases, and
$r=p/n$ for SSB phases, the original gapped phases with odd $r$ are divided
into two phases, while those phases with even $r$ are further separated into
four phases. The gapped parafermionic phases with the TR symmetry include the
symmetry protected topological phases, symmetry enriched topological phases,

the structures and symmetries of their reduced density matrices of those

supramolecular mixtures, such as solutions of polymers or amphiphilic
molecules, using numerical resolutions of a one dimensional model based on mass
transport equations. Solvent evaporation leads to the formation of a
concentrated solute layer at the drying interface, which slows down evaporation
in a long-time scale regime. In this regime, often referred to as the falling
rate period, evaporation is dominated by diffusive mass transport within the
solution, as already known. However, we demonstrate that, in this regime, the
rate of evaporation does not also depend on the ambient humidity for many
molecular complex fluids. Using analytical solutions in some limiting cases, we
first demonstrate that a sharp decrease of the water chemical activity at high
solute concentration, leads to evaporation rates which depend weakly on the
humidity, as the solute concentration at the drying interface slightly depends
on the humidity. However, we also show that a strong decrease of the mutual
diffusion coefficient of the solution enhances considerably this effect,
leading to nearly independent evaporation rates over a wide range of humidity.
The decrease of the mutual diffusion coefficient indeed induces strong
concentration gradients at the drying interface, which shield the concentration
profiles from humidity variations, except in a very thin region close to the
drying interface.

we have performed a series of 3D HD and MHD simulations with the ASH code. We
choose five different models characterized by the radius of their radiative
zone following an evolutionary track computed by a 1D stellar evolution code.
These models characterized stellar evolution from 1 Myr to 50 Myr. By
introducing a seed magnetic field in the fully convective model and spreading
its evolved state through all four remaining cases, we observe systematic
variations in the dynamical properties and magnetic field amplitude and
topology of the models. The five MHD simulations develop strong dynamo field
that can reach equipartition state between the kinetic and magnetic energy and
even super- equipartition levels in the faster rotating cases. We find that the
magnetic field amplitude increases as it evolves toward the ZAMS. Moreover the
magnetic field topology becomes more complex, with a decreasing axisymmetric
component and a non-axisymmetric one becoming predominant. The dipolar
components decrease as the rotation rate and the size of the radiative core
increase. The magnetic fields possess a mixed poloidal-toroidal topology with
no obvious dominant component. Moreover the relaxation of the vestige dynamo
magnetic field within the radiative core is found to satisfy MHD stability
criteria. Hence it does not experience a global reconfiguration but slowly
relaxes by retaining its mixed stable poloidal-toroidal topology.

harmonic triangular lattice with nearest neighbor interactions is investigated.
Initial conditions, typical for molecular dynamics simulations, are considered.
Initially, particles have uncorrelated random velocities, corresponding to
initial kinetic temperature of the system, and zero displacements. These
initial conditions can be realized by heating of the system by an ultrafast
laser pulse. In this case, the kinetic temperature of the system oscillates.
The oscillations are caused by the redistribution of energy between kinetic and
potential parts. At large times, energies equilibrate and temperature tends to
the equilibrium value equal to a half of the initial temperature. In our
previous works, an integral exactly describing this transient thermal process
has been derived. The integrand depends on the dispersion relation for the
lattice. The integral contains large parameter, notably time. In the present
work, we investigate large time behavior of the kinetic temperature. Simple
asymptotic expression for deviation of temperature from the steady state value
is derived. The expression contains three harmonics with different frequencies
and amplitudes. Group velocities corresponding to these frequencies are equal
to zero. Two frequencies are close and therefore beats of kinetic temperature
are observed. Amplitude of deviation of temperature from the steady state value
decreases inversely proportional to time. It is shown that the asymptotic
formula has reasonable accuracy even at small times of order of one period of
atomic vibrations.

paper, they are used to approximate the Bellman operator. Since neural networks
are typically trained using sample data, errors and biases may be introduced.
The design of AVI accounts for implementations with biased approximations of
the Bellman operator and sampling errors. We present verifiable sufficient
conditions under which AVI is stable (almost surely bounded) and converges to a
fixed point of the approximate Bellman operator. To ensure the stability of
AVI, we present three different yet related sets of sufficient conditions that
are based on the existence of an appropriate Lyapunov function. These Lyapunov
function based conditions are easily verifiable and new to the literature. The
verifiability is enhanced by the fact that a recipe for the construction of the
necessary Lyapunov function is also provided. We also show that the stability

atmospheric escape. Previous observations revealed the presence of a giant
hydrogen exosphere transiting the star for more than 5 h, and absorbing up to
56% of the flux in the blue wing of the stellar Lyman-{\alpha} line of neutral
hydrogen (H i Ly{\alpha}). The unexpected size of this comet-like exosphere
prevented observing the full transit of its tail. In this Letter, we present
new Ly{\alpha} observations of GJ 436 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS) instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The
stability of the Ly{\alpha} line over six years allowed us to combine these new
observations with archival data sets, substantially expanding the coverage of
the exospheric transit. Hydrogen atoms in the tail of the exospheric cloud keep
occulting the star for 10-25 h after the transit of the planet, remarkably
confirming a previous prediction based on 3D numerical simulations with the
EVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE). This result strengthens the interpretation
that the exosphere of GJ 436b is shaped by both radiative braking and charge
exchanges with the stellar wind. We further report flux decreases of 15 +/- 2%
and 47 +/- 10% in the red wing of the Ly{\alpha} line and in the line of
ionised silicon (Si iii). Despite some temporal variability possibly linked
with stellar activity, these two signals occur during the exospheric transit
and could be of planetary origin. Follow-up observations will be required to
assess the possibility that the redshifted Ly{\alpha} and Si iii absorption
signatures arise from interactions between the exospheric flow and the magnetic
field of the star.

has not been identified yet. If dominated by fast-cooling synchrotron
radiation, the part of the spectrum immediately below the $\nu F_\nu$ peak
energy should display a power-law behavior with slope $\alpha_2=-3/2$, which
breaks to a higher value $\alpha_1=-2/3$ (i.e. to a harder spectral shape) at
lower energies. Prompt emission spectral data (usually available down to
$\sim10-20\,$keV) are consistent with one single power-law behavior below the
peak, with typical slope $\langle\alpha\rangle=-1$, higher than (and then
inconsistent with) the expected value $\alpha_2=-3/2$. To better characterize
the spectral shape at low energy, we analyzed 14 GRBs for which the Swift X-ray
Telescope started observations during the prompt. When available, Fermi-GBM
observations have been included in the analysis. For 67% of the spectra, models
that usually give a satisfactory description of the prompt (e.g., the Band
model) fail in reproducing the $0.5-1000\,$keV spectra: low-energy data outline
the presence of a spectral break around a few keV.We then introduce an
empirical fitting function that includes a low-energy power law $\alpha_1$, a
break energy $E_{\rm break}$, a second power law $\alpha_2$, and a peak energy
$E_{\rm peak}$. We find $\langle\alpha_1\rangle=-0.66$ ($ \rm \sigma=0.35$),
$\langle \log (E_{\rm break}/\rm keV)\rangle=0.63$ ($ \rm \sigma=0.20$),
$\langle\alpha_2\rangle=-1.46$ ($\rm \sigma=0.31$), and $\langle \log (E_{\rm

$\langle\alpha_1\rangle$ and $\langle\alpha_2\rangle$ are very close to
expectations from synchrotron radiation. In this context, $E_{\rm break}$

the thread level parallelism (TLP). To increase the TLP further, recent GPUs
have increased the number of on-chip registers in every generation. However,
with the increase in the register file size, the leakage power increases. Also,
with the technology advances, the leakage power component has increased and has
become an important consideration for the manufacturing process. The leakage
power of a register file can be reduced by turning infrequently used registers
into low power (drowsy or off) state after accessing them. A major challenge in
doing so is the lack of runtime register access information.
  This paper proposes GREENER (GPU REgister file ENErgy Reducer): a system to
minimize leakage energy of the register file of GPUs. GREENER employs a
compile-time analysis to estimate the run-time register access information. The
result of the analysis is used to determine the power state of the registers
(ON, SLEEP, or OFF) after each instruction. We propose a power optimized
assembly instruction set that allows GREENER to encode the power state of the
registers in the executable itself. The modified assembly, along with a
run-time optimization to update the power state of a register during execution,
results in significant power reduction.
  We implemented GREENER in GPGPU-Sim simulator, and used GPUWattch framework
to measure the register file's leakage power. Evaluation of GREENER on 21
kernels from CUDASDK, GPGPU-SIM, Parboil, and Rodinia benchmarks suites shows
an average reduction of register leakage energy by 69.04% and maximum reduction
of 87.95% with a negligible number of simulation cycles overhead (0.53% on
average).

\emph{codes over graphs}. Here we consider storage systems where the
information is stored on the edges of a complete directed graph with $n$ nodes.
The failure model we consider is of \emph{node failures} which are erasures of
all edges, both incoming and outgoing, connected to the failed node. It is said
that a code over graphs is a \textit{$\rho$-node-erasure-correcting code} if it
can correct the failure of any $\rho$ nodes in the graphs of the code. While
the construction of such optimal codes is an easy task if the field size is
${\cal O} (n^2)$, our main goal in the paper is the construction of codes over
smaller fields. In particular, our main result is the construction of optimal
binary codes over graphs which correct two node failures with a prime number of
nodes.

ensure random expandability, high reliability, and availability of data in RAID

  We provide a data structure for hash-based lookups based on cuckoo hashing
that uses only one off-chip memory access per lookup, by utilizing an on-chip
pre-filter to determine which of multiple locations holds a key. We make
particular use of the flexibility to move elements within a cuckoo hash table

a slightly more complex insertion procedure and some additional memory accesses

key lookups are much more frequent than insertions. An important feature of our

correlator $\langle \cos(\varphi_\alpha + \varphi_\beta - 2\Psi_2) \rangle$
scales almost linearly both with the event $v_2$ and charged-particle
pseudorapidity density. The charge dependence of the three-particle correlator
is often interpreted as evidence for the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), a parity
violating effect of the strong interaction. However, its measured dependence on
$v_2$ points to a large non-CME contribution to the correlator. Comparing the
results with Monte Carlo calculations including a magnetic field due to the
spectators, the upper limit of the CME signal contribution to the
three-particle correlator in the 10-50% centrality interval is found to be
26-33% at 95% confidence level.

and its deuterated form keeps memory of the conditions at that epoch. Thanks to
the unique combination of high angular resolution and sensitivity provided by
ALMA, we wish to measure methanol deuteration in the planet formation region
around a Class 0 protostar and to understand its origin. Aims: We mapped both
the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$DOH distribution in the inner regions ($\sim$100
au) of the HH212 system in Orion B. To this end, we used ALMA Cycle 1 and Cycle
4 observations in Band 7 with angular resolution down to $\sim$0.15$""$.
Results: We detected 6 lines of $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and 13 lines of CH$_2$DOH with
upper level energies up to 438 K in temperature units. We derived a rotational
temperature of (171 $\pm$ 52) K and column densities of 7$\times$10$^{16}$
cm$^{-2}$ ($^{13}$CH$_3$OH) and 1$\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (CH$_2$DOH),
respectively. Consequently, the D/H ratio is (2.4 $\pm$ 0.4)$\times$10$^{-2}$,
a value lower by an order of magnitude with respect to what was previously
measured using single dish telescopes toward protostars located in Perseus. Our
findings are consistent with the higher dust temperatures in Orion B with
respect to that derived for the Perseus cloud. The emission is tracing a
rotating structure extending up to 45 au from the jet axis and elongated by 90
au along the jet axis. So far, the origin of the observed emission appears to
be related with the accretion disk. Only higher spatial resolution measurements
however, will be able to disentangle between different possible scenarios: disk
wind, disk atmosphere, or accretion shocks.

[Phys. Rev. D 79, 064030 (2009)], a quantum theory of the test EM field on an
effective (dressed) spacetime emerges. The nature of this emerging dressed
geometry is independent of the chosen polarization, but it may depend on the
energy of the corresponding field mode. Specifically, when the backreaction of
the field on the quantum geometry is negligible (i.e., a test field
approximation is assumed), all field modes probe the same effective background
independent of the mode's energy. However, when the backreaction of the field
modes on the quantum geometry is significant, by employing a Born-Oppenheimer
approximation, it is shown that a rainbow (i.e., a mode-dependent) metric
emerges. The emergence of this mode-dependent background in the Planck regime
may have a significant effect on the creation of quantum particles. The
production amount on the dressed background is computed and is compared with
the familiar results on the classical geometry.

Inference process of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) has a large

In this work we investigate the
possible formation histories and predicted occurrence rates of mini-Neptunes
assuming the planets form beyond the iceline. We consider pebble and
planetesimal accretion accounting for envelope enrichment and two different
opacity conditions. We find that the formation of mini-Neptunes is a relatively
frequent output when envelope enrichment by volatiles is included, and that
there is a ""sweet spot"" for mini-Neptune formation with a relatively low solid
accretion rate of ~10^{-6} Earth masses per year. This rate is typical for
low/intermediate-mass protoplanetary disks and/or disks with low metallicities.
With pebble accretion, envelope enrichment and high opacity favor the formation
of mini-Neptunes, with more efficient formation at large semi-major axes (~30
AU) and low disk viscosity. For planetesimal accretion, such planets can form
also without enrichment, with the opacity being a key aspect in the growth
history and favorable formation location. Finally, we show that the formation
of Neptune-like planets remains a challenge for planet formation theories.

form of massive dusty envelopes, an event that largely controls the composition
of interstellar matter. The envelopes, however, are distant and opaque to
visible and NIR radiation: Their structure remains poorly known and the
mass-loss process poorly understood. Millimeter-wave interferometry is the
optimal investigative tool for this purpose. The circumstellar envelope IRC +10
216 and its central star, the C-rich TP-AGB star closest to the Sun, are the
best objects for such an investigation. Two years ago, we reported on IRAM 30-m
telescope CO(2-1) line emission observations in that envelope (HPBW 11""). We
now report much higher angular resolution observations of CO(2-1), CO(1-0),
CN(2-1) and C$_4$H(24-23) made with the SMA, PdB and ALMA interferometers (with
synthesized half-power beamwidths of 3"", 1"" and 0.3"", respectively). Although
the envelope appears more intricate at high resolution, its prevailing
structure remains a pattern of thin, nearly concentric shells. Outside the
small (r<0.3"") dust formation zone, the gas appears to expand radially at a
constant velocity, 14.5 km/s, with small turbulent motions. Based on that
property, we have reconstructed the 3-D structure of the outer envelope and
have derived the gas temperature and density radial profiles in the inner
(r<25"") envelope. The over-dense shells have spherical or slightly oblate
shapes and typically extend over a few steradians, implying isotropic mass
loss. The regular spacing of shells in the outer envelope supports the model of
a binary star system with a period of 700 years and a near face-on elliptical
orbit. The companion fly-by triggers enhanced episodes of mass loss near
periastron. The densification of the shell pattern observed in the central part

coefficient, degree correlations and diameter. These properties are in good
agreement with those observed in diverse real-world weighted networks. We then
determine all the eigenvalues and their corresponding multiplicities of the
transition probability matrix for random walks on the weighted networks.
Finally, we apply the obtained spectra to derive explicit expressions for mean
hitting time of random walks and weighted counting of spanning trees on the
weighted networks. Our model is an exactly solvable one, allowing to
analytically treat its structural and dynamical properties, which is thus a
good test-bed and an ideal substrate network for studying different dynamical

emission in a sample of redshift ~2-4 Herschel-ATLAS SMGs. A non-negligible
effect of differential lensing is found for the CO emission lines, which could
have caused significant underestimations of the linewidths, hence of the
dynamical masses. The CO SLEDs are found to be similar to those of the local
starburst-dominated ULIRGs and of the previously studied SMGs. After correcting
for lensing amplification, we derived the global properties of the bulk of
molecular gas in the SMGs using non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. The gas
thermal pressure is found to be correlated with star formation efficiency.
Further decomposing the CO SLEDs into two excitation components, we find a
low-excitation component, which is less correlated with star formation, and a
high-excitation one which is tightly related to the on-going star-forming
activity. Additionally, tight linear correlations between the FIR and CO line
luminosities have been confirmed for the $J \ge 5$ CO lines, implying that
these CO lines are good tracers of star formation. The [CI](2-1) lines follow
the tight linear correlation between the luminosities of the [CI](2-1) and the
CO(1-0) line found in local starbursts, indicating that CI lines could serve as
good total molecular gas mass tracers for high-redshift SMGs. The total mass of
the molecular gas reservoir, $(1-30) \times 10^{10} M_\odot$, suggests a
typical molecular gas depletion time ~20-100 Myr and a gas to dust mass ratio
${\delta}_{\rm GDR}$~30-100. The ratio between CO line luminosity and the dust
mass appears to be slowly increasing with redshift for the SMGs, which need to
be further confirmed. Finally, through comparing the linewidth of CO and H2O
lines, we find that they agree well in almost all our SMGs, confirming that the
emitting regions are co-spatially located.

external magnetic field in the context of nonlocal extensions of the
Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. A detailed description of the formalism is
presented, considering the cases of zero and finite temperature. In particular,
we analyze the effect of the magnetic field on the chiral restoration and
deconfinement transitions, which are found to occur at approximately the same
critical temperatures. Our results show that these models offer a natural
framework to account for the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis found in
lattice QCD calculations.

comparative evaluation of probabilistic models based on proper scoring rules,

of low-dimensional linear subspaces. Algorithms based directly on geometric
properties of such data tend to either provide poor empirical performance, lack
theoretical guarantees, or depend heavily on their initialization. We present a
novel geometric approach to the subspace clustering problem that leverages
ensembles of the K-subspaces (KSS) algorithm via the evidence accumulation
clustering framework. Our algorithm, referred to as ensemble K-subspaces
(EKSS), forms a co-association matrix whose (i,j)th entry is the number of
times points i and j are clustered together by several runs of KSS with random
initializations. We prove general recovery guarantees for any algorithm that
forms an affinity matrix with entries close to a monotonic transformation of
pairwise absolute inner products. We then show that a specific instance of EKSS
results in an affinity matrix with entries of this form, and hence our proposed
algorithm can provably recover subspaces under similar conditions to
state-of-the-art algorithms. The finding is, to the best of our knowledge, the
first recovery guarantee for evidence accumulation clustering and for KSS
variants. We show on synthetic data that our method performs well in the
traditionally challenging settings of subspaces with large intersection,
subspaces with small principal angles, and noisy data. Finally, we evaluate our
algorithm on six common benchmark datasets and show that unlike existing
methods, EKSS achieves excellent empirical performance when there are both a
small and large number of points per subspace.

automate precision tasks, such as weeding and plant monitoring. At the same
time, they move in a continuously changing, semi-structured field environment,
in which features can hardly be found and reproduced at a later time.
Challenges for Lidar and visual detection systems stem from the fact that
plants can be very small, overlapping and have a steadily changing appearance.
Therefore, a popular way to localize vehicles with high accuracy is based on
ex- pensive global navigation satellite systems and not on natural landmarks.
The contribution of this work is a novel image- based plant localization
technique that uses the time-invariant stem emerging point as a reference. Our
approach is based on a fully convolutional neural network that learns landmark
localization from RGB and NIR image input in an end-to-end manner. The network
performs pose regression to generate a plant location likelihood map. Our
approach allows us to cope with visual variances of plants both for different
species and different growth stages. We achieve high localization accuracies as
shown in detailed evaluations of a sugar beet cultivation phase. In experiments
with our BoniRob we demonstrate that detections can be robustly reproduced with
centimeter accuracy.

attracted extensive attention from the data mining community. Existing work
suggests that for many problems, the shape in the current time series may
correlate an upcoming shape in the same or another series. Therefore, it is a
promising strategy to associate two recurring patterns as a rule's antecedent
and consequent: the occurrence of the antecedent can foretell the occurrence of
the consequent, and the learned shape of consequent will give accurate
predictions. Earlier work employs symbolization methods, but the symbolized
representation maintains too little information of the original series to mine
valid rules. The state-of-the-art work, though directly manipulating the
series, fails to segment the series precisely for seeking
antecedents/consequents, resulting in inaccurate rules in common scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a novel motif-based rule discovery method, which
utilizes motif discovery to accurately extract frequently occurring consecutive
subsequences, i.e. motifs, as antecedents/consequents. It then investigates the
underlying relationships between motifs by matching motifs as rule candidates
and ranking them based on the similarities. Experimental results on real open
datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline method by
23.9%. Furthermore, it extends the applicability from single time series to
multiple ones.

have significant impact on the NV centers' emission and charge state.
Nevertheless, a full understanding of all experimental data is still lacking,
with further complications arising from potential differences between the
photo-dynamics of bulk vs. shallow NVs. Here we suggest a generalized
quantitative model for NV center spin and charge state dynamics under both
green and IR excitation. We experimentally extract the relevant transition
rates, providing a comprehensive model which reconciles all existing results in
the literature. Moreover, we identify key differences between the
photo-dynamics of bulk and shallow NVs, and use them to significantly enhance
the initialization fidelity of shallow NVs to the useful negatively-charged
state.

solutions to a family of quasilinear wave equations in three spatial dimensions
featuring a Riccati-type derivative-quadratic semilinear term. The singularity
is more severe than a shock in that the solution itself blows up like the log
of the distance to the blowup-time. We assume that the quasilinear terms
satisfy certain structural assumptions, which in particular ensure that the
""elliptic part"" of the wave operator vanishes precisely at the singular points.
The initial data are compactly supported and can be small or large in
$L^{\infty}$, but the spatial derivatives must initially satisfy a nonlinear
smallness condition compared to the time derivative. The first main idea of the
proof is to construct a quasilinear integrating factor, which allows us to
reformulate the wave equation as a system whose solutions remain regular, all
the way up to the singularity. This is equivalent to constructing quasilinear
vectorfields adapted to the nonlinear flow. The second main idea is to exploit
some crucial monotonic terms in various estimates, especially the energy
estimates, that feature the integrating factor. The availability of the
monotonicity is tied to our assumptions on the data and on the structure of the
quasilinear terms. The third main idea is to propagate the relative smallness
of the spatial derivatives all the way up to the singularity so that the
solution behaves, in many ways, like an ODE solution. As a corollary of our
main results, we show that there are quasilinear wave equations that exhibit
two distinct kinds of blowup: the formation of shocks for one non-trivial set
of data, and ODE-type blowup for another non-trivial set.

prisoner's dilemma games where agents (nodes) can switch both the strategy and
social partners. Under two node-based strategy updating rules, strategy
updating occurs between a randomly chosen focal node and its randomly selected
neighbour. The focal agent becomes the strategy recipient and may imitate the
strategy of the neighbour according to the payoff difference, i.e.
voter-model-like dynamics (VMLD), or becomes a strategy donor and thus may be
imitated by the neighbour, i.e. invasion-process-like dynamics (IPLD). For
edge-based updating rules, one edge is selected, and the roles of the two
connected nodes (donor or recipient) are randomly decided, i.e. edge-based
dynamics (EBD). A computer simulation shows that partner switching supports the
evolution of cooperation under VMLD, which has been utilised in many studies on
spatial evolutionary games, whereas cooperators often vanish under IPLD. The
EBD results lie between these two processes. This difference is prominent among
nodes with large degrees. In addition, partner switching induces a
non-monotonic relationship between the fraction of cooperators and intensity of
selection under VMLD and EBD, and a weak or strong selection supports
cooperation. In contrast, only a strong selection supports cooperators under
IPLD. Similar differences in the enhancement of cooperation are observed when
games are played on static heterogeneous networks. Our results imply that the
direction of imitation is quite important for understanding the evolutionary
process of cooperation.

multiplicative functions, the maximal order of iterations of the functions
remains widely open. The case of the iterated divisor function was only solved
recently, answering a question of Ramanujan from 1915. Here we determine the
maximal order of $\log f(f(n))$ for a class of multiplicative functions $f$. In
particular, this class contains functions counting ideals of given norm in the
ring of integers of an arbitrary, fixed quadratic number field. As a
consequence, we determine such maximal orders for several multiplicative $f$
arising as a normalized function counting representations by certain binary
quadratic forms. Incidentally, for the non-multiplicative function $r_2$ which
counts how often a positive integer is represented as a sum of two squares,
this entails the asymptotic formula $$ \max_{n\leq x} \log r_2(r_2(n))=
\frac{\sqrt{\log x}}{\log \log x} (c/\sqrt{2}+o(1))$$ with some explicitly

its hardware evaluation method remasters the storage traces by interoperating
the inferred time information, and updates all inter-arrival times by making
them aware of the target storage system. We apply the proposed co-evaluation

approach to combine static and dynamic contract checking for the functional
logic language Curry. Based on a formal model of contract checking for
functional logic programming, we propose an automatic method to verify

inter-domain Traffic Engineering. It can benefit from the detection of
significant changes in RTT measurements and the understanding on potential
causes of change. Among the extensive works on change detection methods and
their applications in various domains, few focus on RTT measurements. It is
thus unclear which approach works the best on such data.
  In this paper, we present an evaluation framework for change detection on RTT
times series, consisting of: 1) a carefully labelled 34,008-hour RTT dataset as
ground truth; 2) a scoring method specifically tailored for RTT measurements.
Furthermore, we proposed a data transformation that improves the detection
performance of existing methods. Path changes are as well attended to. We fix
shortcomings of previous works by distinguishing path changes due to routing
protocols (IGP and BGP) from those caused by load balancing.
  Finally, we apply our change detection methods to a large set of measurements
from RIPE Atlas. The characteristics of both RTT and path changes are analyzed;
the correlation between the two are also illustrated. We identify extremely
frequent AS path changes yet with few consequences on RTT, which has not been
reported before.

segmentation has relatively fewer data, unlike the detection task. However, the
shared fusion encoder benefits from joint training to learn a generalized

Moreover, cognitive problems are reduced to the specification of two objects in
a cognitive category: an outset (i.e. the current state of the system) and a
goal (i.e. the desired state). Cognitive systems transform the target system by
means of generators and evaluators. Generators realize cognitive operations
over a system by grouping morphisms, whilst evaluators group objects as a way
to generalize outsets and goals to partially defined states. Meta-cognition
emerges when the whole cognitive system is self-referenced as sub-states in the

previous study at a single gauge coupling $g=1.3$ \cite{DeSarkar2016}. Our
major conclusion is that a continuum limit of free massless photons (with the
redundant pure gauge degrees of freedom decoupled) is achieved at any gauge
coupling, not necessarily small, provided the coefficient $\tilde{\kappa}$ of
the gauge-fixing term is sufficiently large. In fact, the region of continuous
phase transition leading to the above physics in the strong gauge coupling
region is found to be analytically connected to the point $g=0$ and
$\tilde{\kappa} \rightarrow \infty$ where the classical action has a global
unique minimum, around which weak coupling perturbation theory in bare
parameters is defined, controlling the physics of the whole region. A second
major conclusion is that, local algorithms like Multihit Metropolis fail to
produce faithful field configurations with large values of the coefficient
$\tilde{\kappa}$ of the higher derivative gauge-fixing term and at large
lattice volumes. A global algorithm like Hybrid Monte Carlo, although at times
slow to move out of metastabilities, generally is able to produce faithful
configurations and has been used extensively in the current study.

this coupling on the spacetime evolution is investigated here. We present
results on the underlying dynamical equations augmented by a cosmological
constant and integrate them numerically. We also present a method to derive
cosmologically relevant initial variables for this setup. Estimates of angular
power spectra for each metric variable are computed and evaluated on the
central observer's past null cone. By comparing the full evolution to the
freely evolved initial profiles, the coupling strength will be determined for a
best fit radially inhomogeneous patch obtained in previous works (see Redlich

cosmic variance limit and can therefore safely be neglected for a relevant
cosmological scenario. On the contrary, we find very strong coupling effects in
a best fit spherical void model matching the distance redshift relation of SNe

its quantum counterpart, i.e., extended WKT (e-WKT), which is based on
two-photon quantum interferometry. According to the e-WKT, the
difference-frequency distribution of the biphoton wavefunctions can be
extracted by applying a Fourier transform on the time-domain Hong-Ou-Mandel

extracted by applying a Fourier transform on the time-domain NOON state
interference (NOONI) patterns. We also experimentally verified the WKT and
e-WKT in a Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI), a HOMI and a NOONI. This theorem
can be directly applied to quantum spectroscopy, where the spectral correlation

intensity map of the source were calculated. The intensity map provides the
input for modeling the Keck Interferometer (KI) data in the near-infrared
(near-IR) and the data of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with
the mid-infrared instrument MIDI. We conclude that with our limited set of
data, we can fit the SED, the Keck visibilities and the MIDI visibilities using
a two-components disk model. Furthermore, we suspect that MWC480 has a
transitional dusty disk. However, we need more MIDI observations with different
baseline orientations to confirm our modeling.

approach which is capable of reducing correlation effects from other covariates
while fully capturing the magnitude of coefficients. The proposed SPAC is
effective in choosing covariates which have direct effects on the response
variable, while eliminating the predictors which are not directly associated
with the response but are highly correlated with the relevant predictors. We
show that the proposed SPAC method with the Lasso penalty or the smoothly
clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty possesses strong sign consistency in
high-dimensional settings. Numerical studies and a post-traumatic stress
disorder data application also confirm that the proposed method outperforms the
existing Lasso, adaptive Lasso, SCAD, Peter-Clark-simple algorithm, and
factor-adjusted regularized model selection methods when the irrepresentable

unprecedented level of accuracy. Polarization modulation by a half wave plate
(HWP) is a powerful technique able to mitigate a large number of the
instrumental systematics. Our goal is to optimize the polarization modulation
strategy of the upcoming LSPE-SWIPE balloon-borne experiment, devoted to the
accurate measurement of CMB polarization at large angular scales. We depart
from the nominal LSPE-SWIPE modulation strategy (HWP stepped every 60 s with a
telescope scanning at around 12 deg/s) and perform a thorough investigation of
a wide range of possible HWP schemes (either in stepped or continuously
spinning mode and at different azimuth telescope scan-speeds) in the frequency,
map and angular power spectrum domain. In addition, we probe the effect of
high-pass and band-pass filters of the data stream and explore the HWP response
in the minimal case of one detector for one operation day (critical for the
single-detector calibration process). We finally test the modulation
performance against typical HWP-induced systematics. Our analysis shows that
some stepped HWP schemes, either slowly rotating or combined with slow
telescope modulations, represent poor choices. Moreover, our results point out
that the nominal configuration may not be the most convenient choice. While a
large class of spinning designs provides comparable results in terms of pixel
angle coverage, map-making residuals and BB power spectrum standard deviations
with respect to the nominal strategy, we find that some specific configurations
(e.g., a rapidly spinning HWP with a slow gondola modulation) allow a more
efficient polarization recovery in more general real-case situations. Although
our simulations are specific to the LSPE-SWIPE mission, the general outcomes of
our analysis can be easily generalized to other CMB polarization experiments.

Towards such a goal it is important to understand the impact of magnetic field
on the charge transport at the superconductor-normal channel (SN) interface.
Here we carried out a comprehensive study of Andreev conductance under weak
magnetic fields using diffusive superconductor- graphene Josephson weak links.
We observe that the Andreev conductance is suppressed even in magnetic fields
far below the upper critical field of the superconductor. The suppression of
Andreev conductance depends on and can be minimized by controlling the ramping
of the magnetic field. We identify that the key factor behind this suppression
is the reduction of the superconducting gap due to the piling of vortices on
the superconducting contacts. In devices where superconducting gap at the
superconductor-graphene interface is heavily reduced by proximity effect, the
enlarged vortex cores overlap quickly with increasing magnetic field, resulting
in a rapid decrease of the interfacial gap. However, in weak links with
relatively large effective superconducting gap the AR conductance persists up
to the upper critical field. Our results provide guidance to the study of
quantum material-superconductor systems in presence of magnetic field, where
'survival' of induced superconductivity is critical.

over the past 100Myr with the integrator package HNBody. The simulations used
different integrator algorithms, step sizes, initial conditions, and included
effects from general relativity, different models of the Moon, the Sun's
quadrupole moment, and up to sixteen asteroids. I also probed the potential
effect of a hypothetical Planet 9, using one set of possible orbital elements.
The most expensive integration (Bulirsch-Stoer) required 4~months wall-clock
time with a maximum relative energy error <~3e{-13}. The difference in Earth's
eccentricity (DeE) was used to track the difference between two solutions,
considered to diverge at time tau when max|DeE| irreversibly crossed ~10\% of
mean eE (~0.028x0.1). The results indicate that finding a unique orbital
solution is limited by initial conditions from current ephemerides and asteroid
perturbations to ~54Myr. Bizarrely, the 4-month Bulirsch-Stoer integration and
a symplectic integration that required only 5~hours wall-clock time (12-day
time step, Moon as a simple quadrupole perturbation), agree to ~63Myr.
Internally, such symplectic integrations are remarkably consistent even for
large time steps, suggesting that the relationship between time step and tau is
not a robust indicator for the absolute accuracy of symplectic integrations.
The effect of a hypothetical Planet~9 on DeE becomes discernible at ~65Myr.
Using tau as a criterion, the current state-of-the-art solutions all differ
from previously published results beyond ~50Myr. I also conducted an eigenmode
analysis, which provides some insight into the chaotic nature of the inner
Solar System. The current study provides new orbital solutions for applications
in geological studies.

multiple-output (MIMO) system in which the base station (BS) is equipped with
low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In contrast to most
existing results, we assume that the system operates over a frequency-selective
wideband channel and uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to
simplify equalization at the user equipments (UEs). Furthermore, we consider
the practically relevant case of oversampling DACs. We theoretically analyze
the uncoded bit error rate (BER) performance with linear precoders (e.g., zero
forcing) and quadrature phase-shift keying using Bussgang's theorem. We also
develop a lower bound on the information-theoretic sum-rate throughput
achievable with Gaussian inputs, which can be evaluated in closed form for the
case of 1-bit DACs. For the case of multi-bit DACs, we derive approximate, yet
accurate, expressions for the distortion caused by low-precision DACs, which
can be used to establish lower bounds on the corresponding sum-rate throughput.
Our results demonstrate that, for a massive MU-MIMO-OFDM system with a
128-antenna BS serving 16 UEs, only 3--4 DAC bits are required to achieve an
uncoded BER of 10^-4 with a negligible performance loss compared to the
infinite-resolution case at the cost of additional out-of-band emissions.
Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of taking into account the
inherent spatial and temporal correlations caused by low-precision DACs.

with time dependence. This powerful result permits explicit solutions to all
Schr\""odinger and von Neumann equations for time-commuting Hamiltonians, and
explicit solutions to any degree of approximation in the non-time-commuting

  Network for Short-term Wind Power Forecasting",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wind power forecasting (WPF) is significant to guide the dispatching of grid
and the production planning of wind farm effectively. The intermittency and
volatility of wind leading to the diversity of the training samples have a
major impact on the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, to deal with the
training samples dynamics and improve the forecasting accuracy, a data mining
approach consisting of K-means clustering and bagging neural network is
proposed for short-term WPF. Based on the similarity among historical days,
K-means clustering is used to classify the samples into several categories,
which contain the information of meteorological conditions and historical power
data. In order to overcome the over fitting and instability problems of
conventional networks, a bagging-based ensemble approach is integrated into the
back propagation neural network. To confirm the effectiveness, the proposed
data mining approach is examined on real wind generation data traces. The
simulation results show that it can obtain better forecasting accuracy than
other baseline and existed short-term WPF approaches.

system I/O performance; (2) computing and software overheads; (3) I/O

with high relative speed causes an apparent frequency shift for the received
wireless wave, which consequently decreases the reliability of the recovered
safety information and jeopardizes the safety of vehicular CPS. Passive
confrontation of Doppler shift at the receiver side is not applicable due to
multiple Doppler shifts at each receiver. In this paper, we provide a proactive
Doppler shift compensation algorithm based on the probabilistic graphical
model. Each vehicle pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that
there is no frequency shift from the desired carrier frequency between each
pair of transceiver. The pre-compensated offset for each vehicle is computed in
a distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed and dynamic

sensor-less approach which includes iterative aberration correction with a fast
deformable mirror (DM). A combination of sharpness metric (SM) image evaluation
and iterative optimization is demonstrated. The SM was measured for each image
while adjusting seven Zernike modes (after Noll index enumeration) in their
amplitude. The SM is used as an indicator for wave front aberrations without
using a wave front sensor to correct wave front distortions that are generated
by the DM. The proposed method allows for the reduction of systematic
measurement uncertainties in fluid flow measurement techniques as particle
image velocimetry (PIV). Five different sharpness metrics are demonstrated for
reliable sharpness maximization with a deformable mirror of 69 elements. A
systematic linear search (LS) algorithm was applied in order to find the
optimal mirror shape. The reduction of measurement uncertainty for PIV
measurements is shown. The iterative approach offers a way to reduce static or
slowly changing wave front distortions in a fluid flow setup where a WFS is not
applicable.
