performance for machine translation. One of the reasons for their effectiveness
is their ability to capture relevant source-side contextual information at each
time-step prediction through an attention mechanism. However, the target-side
context is solely based on the sequence model which, in practice, is prone to a
recency bias and lacks the ability to capture effectively non-sequential
dependencies among words. To address this limitation, we propose a
target-side-attentive residual recurrent network for decoding, where attention
over previous words contributes directly to the prediction of the next word.
The residual learning facilitates the flow of information from the distant past
and is able to emphasize any of the previously translated words, hence it gains
access to a wider context. The proposed model outperforms a neural MT baseline
as well as a memory and self-attention network on three language pairs. The
analysis of the attention learned by the decoder confirms that it emphasizes a
wider context, and that it captures syntactic-like structures.

the particular case of interval-valued variables. The proposed method describes
the correlation structure among the measured interval-valued variables in terms
of a few underlying, but unobservable, uncorrelated interval-valued variables,
called \textit{common factors}. Uniform and Triangular distributions are
considered within each observed interval. We obtain the corresponding sample
mean, variance and covariance assuming a general Triangular distribution.
  In our proposal, factors are extracted either by Principal Component or by
Principal Axis Factoring, performed on the interval-valued variables
correlation matrix. To estimate the values of the common factors, usually
called \textit{factor scores}, two approaches are considered, which are
inspired in methods for real-valued data: the Bartlett and the Anderson-Rubin
methods. In both cases, the estimated values are obtained solving an
optimization problem that minimizes a function of the weighted squared Mallows
distance between quantile functions. Explicit expressions for the quantile
function and the squared Mallows distance are derived assuming a general
Triangular distribution.
  The applicability of the method is illustrated using two sets of data:
temperature and precipitation in cities of the United States of America between
the years 1971 and 2000 and measures of car characteristics of different makes
and models. Moreover, the method is evaluated on synthetic data with predefined
correlation structures.

for multicore processors, based on an integral controller with adjustable gain.
The gain is designed for wide stability margins, and computed in real time as
part of the control law. The tracking performance of the control system is
robust with respect to modeling uncertainties and computational errors in the
loop. The main challenge of designing such a controller is that the power
dissipation of program-workloads varies widely and often cannot be measured
accurately; hence extant controllers are either ad hoc or based on a-priori
modeling characterizations of the processor and workloads. Our approach is
different. Leveraging the aforementioned robustness it uses a simple textbook
modeling framework, and adjusts its parameters in real time by a
system-identification module. In this it trades modeling precision for fast
computations in the loop making it suitable for on-line implementation in
commodity data-center processors. Consequently, the proposed controller is
agnostic in the sense that it does not require any a-priori system
characterizations. We present an implementation of the controller on Intel's
fourth-generation microarchitecture, Haswell, and test it on a number of
industry benchmark programs which are used in scientific computing and
datacenter applications. Results of these experiments are presented in detail
exposing the practical challenges of implementing provably-convergent power

the evidence for a decline in alpha/Fe with increasing metallicity in the
BootesI ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD), that is most probably due to the ejecta
of type Ia supernovae. For Na/Fe, Na/Mg, and Al/Mg, the MW halo and all dSphs
reveal indistinguishable trends with metallicity, suggesting that the processes
of Na and Al synthesis are identical in all systems, independent of their mass.
The dichotomy in the [Sr/Ba] versus [Ba/H] diagram is observed in the classical
dSphs, similarly to the MW halo, calling for two different nucleosynthesis

85%Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-10%Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-5%BaTiO3, were mapped in reciprocal space by
3D electron diffraction. Furthermore, a comprehensive model of the local
disorder was developed by analysing the intensity and morphology of the
observed weak diffuse scattering. We found that the studied ceramics consists
of plate-like in-phase oxygen octahedral nanoscale domains randomly distributed
in an antiphase tilted matrix. In addition, A-site chemical short-range order
of Na/Bi and polar displacements contribute to different kinds of diffuse
scattering. The proposed model explains all the observed diffraction features
and offers insight into the ongoing controversy over the nature of local
structural distortions in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-based solid solutions.

mass-loss in the form of radiative wind or an excretion disk. We wished to
spatially resolve the photosphere and gaseous environment of 51 Oph, a peculiar
star with a very high vsin(i) of 267km s$^{-1}$ and an evolutionary status that
remains unsettled. It has been classified by different authors as a Herbig, a
$\beta$ Pic, or a classical Be star. We used the VEGA visible beam combiner
installed on the CHARA array that reaches a submilliarcsecond resolution.
Observation were centered on the H$\alpha$ emission line. We derived, for the
first time, the extension and flattening of 51 Oph photosphere. We found a
major axis of $\theta_{{\mathrm{eq}}}$=8.08$\pm$0.70$R_\odot$ and a minor axis
of $\theta_{{\mathrm{pol}}}$=5.66$\pm$0.23$R_\odot$ .
  This high photosphere distortion shows that the star is rotating close to its
critical velocity. Finally, using spectro-interferometric measurements in the
H$ \alpha$ line, we constrained the circumstellar environment geometry and
kinematics and showed that the emission is produced in a 5.2$\pm$2R$_{*}$ disk
in Keplerian rotation. From the visible point of view, 51 Oph presents all the
features of a classical Be star: near critical-rotation and double-peaked
H$\alpha $ line in emission produced in a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation.
However, this does not explain the presence of dust as seen in the mid-infrared
and millimeter spectra, and the evolutionary status of 51 Oph remains
unsettled.

interesting to test this hypothesis. The ratio of the energy emitted in

constrain the environment of such astrophysical events. In addition to putting
constraints by use of the non-detection of counterpart neutrinos, it is also
possible to consider the diffuse neutrino flux measured by the IceCube

that can be emitted in neutrinos. Nevertheless, combining both methods should
allow to strongly constrain the source population in case of a future neutrino

potential upcoming LIGO events, including binary neutron stars and black

improved with the inclusion of the growth of structure data set measurements.

first measurement of relativistic effects near a SMBH. We report the first
limits on the binarity of S0-2 from radial velocity monitoring, which has
implications for both understanding its origin and robustness as a probe of the
central gravitational field. With 87 radial velocity measurements, which
include 12 new observations presented, we have the data set to look for radial
velocity variations from S0-2's orbital model. Using a Lomb-Scargle analysis
and orbit fitting for potential binaries, we detect no radial velocity
variation beyond S0-2's orbital motion and do not find any significant periodic
signal. The lack of a binary companion does not currently distinguish between
different formation scenarios for S0-2. The upper limit on the mass of a
companion star ($M_{\text{comp}}$) still allowed by our results has a median
upper limit of $M_{\text{comp}}$ $\sin i \leq$ 1.6 M$_{\odot}$ for periods
between 1 and 150 days, the longest period to avoid tidal break up of the
binary. We also investigate the impact of the remaining allowed binary system

2018. While binary star systems are important to consider for this experiment,
we find plausible binaries for S0-2 will not alter a 5$\sigma$ detection of the

  updated",,,"NCTS-TH/1714","hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering
amplitudes for particles of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the
familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these
variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with
the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors.
We systematically characterise all possible three particle amplitudes
compatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity, in the form of consistent
factorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct all
possible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis
in which to expand all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can
be called ""spinning polynomials"". Many general results of quantum field theory
follow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging from the set of all
possible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and
the Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why
massive particles of sufficiently high spin can not be ""elementary"". The Higgs
and Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally discovered as an infrared unification
of many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number of massive
amplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to
Higgsing for gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism
at one-loop, giving few-line computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the
beta function and rational terms in QCD. ""Off-shell"" observables like
correlation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering
amplitudes with external ""probe"" particles of general mass and spin, so all
these objects--amplitudes, form factors and correlators, can be studied from a
common on-shell perspective.

collapse luminescence. Our innovative measurement system captures a broad

collapses of laser-induced bubbles in water. By varying the bubble size,
driving pressure and the perceived gravity level aboard parabolic flights, we
probed the limit from aspherical to highly spherical bubble collapses.
Luminescence was detected for bubbles of maximum radii within the previously
uncovered range $R_{0}$ =1.5-6 mm for laser-induced bubbles. The relative
luminescence energy was found to rapidly decrease as a function of bubble
asymmetry quantified by the anisotropy parameter $\zeta$, which is the
dimensionless equivalent of the Kelvin impulse. As established previously,
$\zeta$ also dictates the characteristic parameters of bubble-driven microjets.
The threshold of $\zeta$ beyond which no luminescence is observed in our
experiment closely coincides with the threshold where the microjets visibly
pierce the bubble and drive a vapor-jet during the rebound. The individual
fitted blackbody temperatures range between $T_{\rm lum}$=7000 and 11500 K but
do not show any clear trend as a function of $\zeta$. Time-resolved
measurements using a high-speed photodetector disclose multiple luminescence
events at each bubble collapse. The averaged full width at half maximum of the
pulse is found to scale with $R_{0}$ and to range between 10-20 ns.

differences is observed to be pierced and stretched by the uppermost nanowires.
The energy shifts of the characteristic Raman bands confirms that these
differences in the nanowire height has a significant impact on the local
graphene strain and the carrier concentration. The images obtained by Kelvin

is modulated by the nanowire substrate and dependent on the nanowire density.
Therefore, the observed surface enhanced Raman scattering for graphene

benefits of information exchange across tasks in reinforcement learning and
adapt transfer to learning our value function estimates in a novel manner. In
this paper, we consider the special case of transfer between the value function
estimates in the $Q$-ensemble architecture of BootstrappedDQN. We further
empirically demonstrate how our proposed framework can help in speeding up the
learning process in $Q$-ensembles with minimum computational overhead on a
suite of Atari 2600 Games.

previous calculations of classical Gilbert damping ($\alpha_{GD}$), we

$S\rightarrow\infty$ we show that the formalism recovers the torque correlation

spin-orbital torque correlation contributions. The formalism is generalized to
take into account a self consistently determined dephasing mechanism which
preserves the conservation laws and allows the investigation of the effect of
disorder. The dependence of $\alpha_{GD}$ on Pt thickness and disorder strength
is calculated and the spin diffusion length of Pt and spin mixing conductance
of the bilayer are determined and compared with experiments.

least squares problems. In image reconstruction, the problem can be ill-posed
and also contaminated by noise; due to this, approaches such as regularization
should be utilized. Total variation (TV) is a useful regularization penalty,
frequently utilized in image reconstruction for generating images with sharp
edges. When a non-quadratic norm is selected for regularization, as is the case
for TV, then it is no longer possible to use CG. Non-linear CG is an
alternative, but it does not share the efficiency that CG shows with least
squares and methods such as fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms
(FISTA) are preferred for problems with TV norm. A different approach to
including prior information is superiorization. In this paper it is shown that
the conjugate gradient method can be superiorized. Five different CG variants
are proposed, including preconditioned CG. The CG methods superiorized by the
total variation norm are presented and their performance in image
reconstruction is demonstrated. It is illustrated that some of the proposed
variants of the superiorized CG method can produce reconstructions of superior
quality to those produced by FISTA and in less computational time, due to the
speed of the original CG for least squares problems.

the vacuum of a noncommutative (NC) Coulomb branch that satisfies the
Heisenberg algebra. Due to the fact that IR fluctuations in the NC Coulomb
branch always pair with UV fluctuations, this UV/IR mixing is extendable to a
macroscopic scale. These vacuum fluctuations in the NC Coulomb branch are
described by a four-dimensional NC $U(1)$ gauge theory. The order parameter for
the vacuum fluctuations is given by random four-vectors that have their own
causal structure in the commutative limit unlike the conventional cosmological
models based on a scalar field theory coupled to gravity. We show that their
causal structure results in the different nature of gravitational interactions
so that space-like fluctuations give rise to the repulsive gravitational force
while time-like fluctuations generate the attractive gravitational force. Given
the fact that the fluctuations are random in nature and we live in a
(3+1)-dimensional spacetime, the ratio of the repulsive vs. attractive
components ends up being 3:1 = 75:25, which is interestingly consistent with
the dark components of the current universe. If we include ordinary matters
acting as an attractive gravitational force, the emergent gravity could more
accurately explain the dark side of our universe. This work is an expanded

suggests the presence of dense circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding the
exploding progenitor stars. This has important implications for the activity
and structure of massive stars near the end of their lives. Since previous work
focused on just a few events, here we expand to a larger sample of twenty
well-observed SNe II. For each event we are able to constrain the progenitor
zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass, explosion energy, and the mass and radial
extent of dense CSM. We then study the distribution of each of these properties
across the full sample of SNe. The inferred ZAMS masses are found to be largely
consistent with a Salpeter distribution with minimum and maximum masses of 10.4
and 22.9 Msun, respectively. We also compare the individual ZAMS masses we
measure with specific SNe II that have pre-explosion imaging to check their
consistency. Our masses are generally comparable to or larger than the
pre-explosion imaging masses, potentially helping ease the red supergiant
problem. The explosion energies vary from (0.1-1.3)x10^51 erg, and for ~70% of
the SNe we obtain CSM masses in the range between 0.18-0.83 Msun. We see a
potential correlation between the CSM mass and explosion energy, which suggests
that pre-explosion activity has a strong impact on the structure of the star.
This may be important to take into account in future studies of the ability of
the neutrino mechanism to explode stars. We also see a possible correlation
between the CSM's radial extent and ZAMS mass, which could be related to the
time with respect to explosion when the CSM is first generated.

along the $z$ direction in a moving nucleon which enables direct lattice
calculations of parton distribution functions. It can be defined with a
nonperturbative renormalization in a regularization independent momentum
subtraction scheme (RI/MOM), which can then be perturbatively related to the
collinear parton distribution in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. Here we
carry out a direct matching from the RI/MOM scheme for the quasi-PDF to the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ PDF, determining the non-singlet quark matching
coefficient at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory. We find that the
RI/MOM matching coefficient is insensitive to the ultraviolet region of
convolution integral, exhibits improved perturbative convergence when
converting between the quasi-PDF and PDF, and is consistent with a quasi-PDF
that vanishes in the unphysical region as the proton momentum $P^z\to \infty$,
unlike other schemes. This direct approach therefore has the potential to
improve the accuracy for converting quasi-distribution lattice calculations to
collinear distributions.

the Boer-Mulders or Sivers transverse momentum dependent distribution
functions. The different colour structure should be visible already at the
lowest possible order that gives a contribution to the double Boer-Mulders

exchanges. To discriminate between the different predictions, we compute the
leading-power contribution to the low-$Q_T$ dBM cross section at the two-gluon
exchange order in the context of a spectator model. The computation is
performed using a method of regions analysis with Collins subtraction terms

the three-gluon vertex are essential. Furthermore, the Glauber region turns out
to play an important role - in fact, it is possible to assign the full

the two gluons have Glauber scaling. A similar disentanglement of colour is

growing primarily through mergers with lower mass clusters and the continual
accretion of group-mass halos. Galaxy clusters assemble late, doubling their
masses since z~0.5, and so the outer regions of clusters should be replete with
infalling group-mass systems. We present an XMM-Newton survey to search for
X-ray groups in the infall regions of 23 massive galaxy clusters at z~0.2,
identifying 39 X-ray groups that have been spectroscopically confirmed to lie
at the cluster redshift. These groups have mass estimates in the range
2x10^13-7x10^14Msun, and group-to-cluster mass ratios as low as 0.02. The
comoving number density of X-ray groups in the infall regions is ~25x higher
than that seen for isolated X-ray groups from the XXL survey. The average mass
per cluster contained within these X-ray groups is 2.2x10^14Msun, or 19% of the
mass within the primary cluster itself. We estimate that ~10^15Msun clusters
increase their masses by 16% between z=0.223 and the present day due to the
accretion of groups with M200>10^13.2Msun. This represents about half of the
expected mass growth rate of clusters at these late epochs. The other half is
likely to come from smooth accretion of matter not bound in halos. The mass
function of the infalling X-ray groups appears significantly top-heavy with
respect to that of field X-ray systems, consistent with expectations from
numerical simulations, and the basic consequences of collapsed massive dark
matter halos being biased tracers of the underlying large-scale density

central star, producing a lopsided feature in scattered light, as the outer gap
edge shows an asymmetry in density and temperature attributable to a secondary
spiral arm launched not from the Lindblad resonances but from the 2:1
resonance. We conclude that high-mass planets lead to shocks in disks that may
be directly observed, particularly at wavelengths of 10 mm or longer, but that
they are more likely to reveal their presence in scattered light by puffing up
their outer gap edges and exciting multiple spiral arms.

out-of-order packet arrivals), (ii) They hold for multi-server packet

strong variability in the near-infrared (NIR) to X-ray energies with detection
at $\gamma$-ray energies as well. Most of the optical flux variations exhibit
strong changes in polarization angle and degree. All the inter-band time lags
are consistent with simultaneous emissions. Interestingly, on days with
excellent data coverage in the NIR--UV bands, the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) show signatures of bumps in the visible--UV bands, never seen before in
this source. The optical bump can be explained as accretion-disk emission
associated with the primary black hole of mass $\sim \rm 1.8 \times10^{10}
M_{\odot}$ while the little bump feature in the optical-UV appears consistent
with line emission. Further, the broadband SEDs extracted during the first
flare and during a quiescent period during this span show very different
$\gamma$-ray spectra compared to previously observed flare or quiescent
spectra. The probable thermal bump in the visible seems to have been clearly
present since May 2013, as found by examining all available NIR-optical
observations, and favors the binary super-massive black hole model. The
simultaneous multi-wavelength variability and relatively weak $\gamma$-ray
emission that shows a shift in the SED peak is consistent with $\gamma$-ray
emission originating from inverse Compton scattering of photons from the line
emission that apparently contributes to the little blue bump.

a natural objective and has been a subject of research over the years. In this
paper, we focus on a class of markets exhibiting the substitutes property with
sellers having divisible and replenishable goods. Depending on the prices
chosen, each seller observes a certain demand which is satisfied subject to the
supply constraint. The goal of the seller is to price her good dynamically so
as to maximize her revenue. For the static market case, when the consumer
utility satisfies the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) property, we
give a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound on the maximum loss in revenue of a seller
using a modified version of the celebrated Online Gradient Descent Algorithm by
Zinkevich. For a more specialized set of consumer utilities satisfying the
iso-elasticity condition, we show that when each seller uses a
regret-minimizing algorithm satisfying a certain technical property, the regret
with respect to $(1-\alpha)$ times optimal revenue is bounded as $O(T^{1/4} /
\sqrt{\alpha})$. We extend this result to markets with dynamic supplies and
prove a corresponding dynamic regret bound, whose guarantee deteriorates
smoothly with the inherent instability of the market. As a side-result, we also
extend the previously known convergence results of these algorithms in a
general game to the dynamic setting.

long-standing goal of liquid crystal research. Here we show that the elasticity
of a liquid crystal system consisting of a dense suspension of semiflexible
biopolymers can be manipulated over a relatively wide range of elastic moduli.
Specifically, thin films of actin filaments are assembled at an oil-water
interface. At sufficiently high concentrations, one observes the formation of a
nematic phase riddled with $\pm1/2$ topological defects, characteristic of a
two-dimensional nematic system. As the average filament length increases, the
defect morphology transitions from a U-shape into a V-shape, indicating the
relative increase of the material's bend over splay modulus. Furthermore,
through the sparse addition of rigid microtubule filaments, one can further
control the liquid crystal elasticity. We show how the material's bend constant
can be raised linearly as a function of microtubule filament density, and
present a simple means to extract absolute values of the elastic moduli from
purely optical observations. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to
predict not only the static structure of the material, including its
topological defects, but also the evolution of the system into dynamically
arrested states. Despite the non-equilibrium nature of the material, our
continuum model, which couples structure and hydrodynamics, is able to capture
the annihilation and movement of defects over long time scales. Thus, we have
experimentally realized a lyotropic liquid crystal system that can be truly
engineered, with tunable mechanical properties, and a theoretical framework to
capture its structure, mechanics, and dynamics.

studied taking into account the energy loss of the shock owing to the
production of nonthermal particles. The polarization degree depends on the
downstream temperature and the velocity difference between upstream and
downstream regions. The former is derived once the line width of the broad
component of the H$\alpha$ emission is observed. Then, the observation of the
polarization degree tells us the latter. At the same time, the estimated value
of the velocity difference independently predicts adiabatic downstream
temperature that is derived from Rankine-Hugoniot relations for adiabatic
shocks. If the actually observed downstream temperature is lower than the
adiabatic temperature, there is a missing thermal energy which is consumed for
particle acceleration. It is shown that a larger energy loss rate leads to more
highly polarized H$\alpha$ emission. Furthermore, we find that polarized
intensity ratio of H$\beta$ to H$\alpha$ also depends on the energy loss rate
and that it is independent of uncertain quantities such as electron
temperature, the effect of Lyman line trapping and our line of sight.

posts to describe where they are, what they are seeing, and how they are
feeling. Because written text lacks the emotional cues of spoken and
face-to-face dialogue, ambiguities are common in written language. This problem
is exacerbated in the short, informal nature of many social media posts. To
bypass this issue, a suite of special characters called ""emojis,"" which are
small pictograms, are embedded within the text. Many emojis are small
depictions of facial expressions designed to help disambiguate the emotional
meaning of the text. However, a new ambiguity arises in the way that emojis are
rendered. Every platform (Windows, Mac, and Android, to name a few) renders
emojis according to their own style. In fact, it has been shown that some
emojis can be rendered so differently that they look ""happy"" on some platforms,
and ""sad"" on others. In this work, we use real-world data to verify the
existence of this problem. We verify that the usage of the same emoji can be
significantly different across platforms, with some emojis exhibiting different
sentiment polarities on different platforms. We propose a solution to identify
the intended emoji based on the platform-specific nature of the emoji used by
the author of a social media post. We apply our solution to sentiment analysis,
a task that can benefit from the emoji calibration technique we use in this
work. We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the mapping in
this task.

the case of reification and formalize the concept of contextualizing logical
statements in the case of Description Logics. Then, we define several
properties of contextualization that are desirable. No previous approaches
satisfy all of the them. Consequently, we define a new way of contextually
annotating statements. It is inspired by NdFluents, which is itself an
extension of the 4dFluents approach for annotating statements with temporal
context. In NdFluents, instances that are involved in a contextual statement
are sliced into contextual parts, such that only parts in the same context hold
relations to one another, with the goal of better preserving inferences. We
generalize this idea by defining contextual parts of relations and classes.
This formal construction better satisfies the properties, although not
entirely. We show that it is a particular case of a general mechanism that
NdFluents also instantiates, and present other variations.

precisely, we examine a planar, non-nested, U-turn model whose partition

appeared in: Kuperberg; Hamel and King; Brubaker, Bump, Chinta, and Gunnells;

  Our main result is that these new families of ""metaplectic"" models are
solvable---i.e., they possess Yang--Baxter equations. We use this to derive two
types of functional equations involving $Z_{\lambda}$ corresponding to the two
root lengths for simple reflections of the symplectic Weyl group. It is widely
believed that the local component of metaplectic Eisenstein series is a
metaplectic Whittaker function, though this is subtle owing to the lack of
uniqueness of Whittaker models and only verified in type A by McNamara. Thus,
we also give evidence for the conjecture that $Z_{\lambda}$ is a spherical
Whittaker function by showing that $Z_{\lambda}$ satisfies the same identities
under our solution to the Yang--Baxter equation as the metaplectic Whittaker
function under intertwining operators on the unramified principal series of an

connectomes, describing the connections of the human brain, typically contain
several hundred vertices today, one can compute and analyze the much deeper,
harder-to-compute classical graph parameters for these, relatively small graphs
of the brain. This deeper approach has proven to be very successful in the
comparison of the connectomes of the sexes in our earlier works: we have shown
that graph parameters, deeply characterizing the graph connectivity are
significantly better in women's connectomes than in men's. In the present

higher average degree, density, larger minimum vertex cover and Hoffman bound

system is their size-ordering when ranked in orbital separation. Kepler has
revealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like
Kepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the
hypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might
reasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes.
However, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature,
may erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they
formed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary
system's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighboring
planets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain. We
derive closed-form solutions for many of the micro state occupancies and
provide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to ten-planet
systems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property
that their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We
find that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in
entropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for
systems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is
robust against the possibility of missing planets too. Put together, our work
establishes that Kepler systems do indeed remember something of their younger
years and highlights the value of information theory for exoplanetary science.

parton, $x_p \gtrsim 0.1$, have a smaller than average size. The QCD $Q^2$
evolution equations suggest that these small configurations also have a
significantly smaller interaction strength, which has observable consequences
in collisions with nuclei. We perform a global analysis of jet production data
in proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Using a model
which takes a distribution of interaction strengths into account, we
quantitatively extract the $x_p$-dependence of the average interaction
strength, $\sigma(x_p)$, over a wide kinematic range. By comparing the RHIC and
LHC results, our analysis finds that the interaction strength for small
configurations, while suppressed, grows faster with collision energy than does
that for average configurations. We check that this energy dependence is
consistent with the results of a method which, given $\sigma(x_p)$ at one
energy, can be used to quantitatively predict that at another. This finding
further suggests that at even lower energies, nucleons with a large-$x_p$
parton should interact much more weakly than those in an average configuration,
a phenomenon in line with explanations of the EMC effect for large-$x_p$ quarks
in nuclei based on color screening.

the CPT-odd classes ($V_{\mu}$ breaking vector) associated with the
Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) model, the DRs and the Lagrangian show for the
photon an effective mass, gauge invariant, proportional to $|{\vec V}|$. The
group velocity exhibits a classic dependency on the inverse of the frequency

All DRs display an angular dependence and lack LoSy invariance. In describing

complex or simply imaginary frequencies and super-luminal speeds and ii) the

non-conservation of the photon energy-momentum tensor. We do so for both CPT

dimensionless number for quantifying the effective scale of fluid transport is
the Reynolds number, Re, which gives the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.
What may work well for one Re regime may not produce significant flows for
another. These differences in scale have implications for many organisms,
ranging from the mechanics of how organisms move through their fluid
environment to how hearts pump at various stages in development. Some
organisms, such as soft pulsing corals, actively contract their tentacles to
generate mixing currents that enhance photosynthesis. Their unique morphology
and intermediate scale where both viscous and inertial forces are significant
make them a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing. In this
paper, 3D fluid-structure interaction simulations of a pulsing soft coral are
used to quantify fluid transport and fluid mixing across a wide range of Re.
The results show that net transport is negligible for $Re<10$, and continuous
upward flow is produced for $Re\geq 10$.

world. Within the body, arrays of extracellular proteins, microvilli, and cilia
can act as both protective layers and mechanosensors. For example, blood flow
profiles through the endothelial surface layer determine the amount of shear
stress felt by the endothelial cells and may alter the rates at which molecules
enter and exit the cells. Characterizing the flow profiles through such layers
is therefore critical towards understanding the function of such arrays in cell
signaling and molecular filtering. External filtering layers are also important
to many animals and plants. Trichomes (the hairs or fine outgrowths on plants)
can drastically alter both the average wind speed and profile near the leaf's
surface, affecting the rates of nutrient and heat exchange. In this paper,
dynamically scaled physical models are used to study the flow profiles outside
of arrays of cylinders that represent such filtering and protective layers. In
addition, numerical simulations using the Immersed Boundary Method are used to
resolve the 3D flows within the layers. The experimental and computational
results are compared to analytical results obtained by modeling the layer as a
homogeneous porous medium with free flow above the layer. The experimental
results show that the bulk flow is well described by simple analytical models.
The numerical results show that the spatially averaged flow within the layer is
well described by the Brinkman model. The numerical results also demonstrate
that the flow can be highly 3D with fluid moving into and out of the layer.
These effects are not described by the Brinkman model and may be significant
for biologically relevant volume fractions. The results of this paper can be
used to understand how variations in density and height of such structures can
alter shear stresses and bulk flows.

selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable,

an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG)
has been identified as critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on
network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the
brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains
unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understand word selection as a
network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived
from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we computed network
controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the
LIFG between administrations of two word selection tasks. We find that a
statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of

vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response (word generation)
vs. closed-response (number naming) tasks. Moreover, we find that a statistic

basic structures can result in inconsistent dimensions among them, and
consequently, end up with invalid LSTM units. To overcome the problem, we
propose Intrinsic Sparse Structures (ISS) in LSTMs. Removing a component of ISS
will simultaneously decrease the sizes of all basic structures by one and
thereby always maintain the dimension consistency. By learning ISS within LSTM
units, the obtained LSTMs remain regular while having much smaller basic

""parking"") of discs on constant-curvature surfaces: the plane, sphere,
hyperboloid, and projective plane, all embedded in three-dimensional space. We
simulate complete parkings by explicitly calculating the boundary of the
available area in which discs can park and concentrating new points in this
area. This makes our algorithm efficient and also provides a diagnostic to
determine when each parking is complete, so there is no need to extrapolate
data from incomplete parkings to study questions of physical interest.
  We use our algorithm to study the number distribution and density of discs
parked in each space, where for the plane and hyperboloid we consider two
different periodic tilings each. We make several notable observations: (i) On
the sphere, there is a critical disc radius such the number of discs parked is
always exactly four: the random parking is actually deterministic. We prove
this statement rigorously, and also show that random parking on the surface of
a $d$-dimensional sphere would have deterministic behaviour at the same
critical radius. (ii) The average number of parked discs does not always
monotonically increase as the disc radius decreases: on the plane (square with
periodic boundary conditions), there is an interval of decreasing radius over
which the average *decreases*. We give a heuristic explanation for this
counterintuitive finding. (iii) As the disc radius shrinks to zero, the density
(average fraction of area covered by parked discs) appears to converge to the
same constant for all spaces, though it is always slightly larger for a sphere
and slightly smaller for a hyperboloid. Therefore, for parkings on a general
curved surface we would expect higher local densities in regions of positive
curvature and lower local densities in regions of negative curvature.

proposed algorithm converges to the unique positive definite solution
(bimatrix) to the bimatrix Riccati equation with appropriate initial
conditions. With the help of this iterative algorithm, LQR problem for the
antilinear system, which is a special case of complex-valued linear system, was
carefully examined and three different Riccati equations based approaches were
provided, namely, bimatrix Riccati equation, anti-Riccati equation and normal

HetNets which consist of high power nodes and low power nodes. The optimization
objective function with transmit bit rate and power constraints, which is
non-convex and hard to be directly derived, is firstly transformed into matrix

according to the Perron-Frobenius theory. A heuristic iterative algorithm based

NbP. When the applied magnetic field $H$ is above a critical value $H_c$, a
reentrance appears as a peak in the temperature dependent resistivity
$\rho_{xx}(T)$ at $T$ = $T_p$, similar to that observed in graphite where it
was attributed to local superconductivity. The $T_p(H)$ relationship follows a
power-law dependence $T_p\sim(H-H_c)^{1/v}$ where $v$ can be derived from the
temperature dependence of the zero-field resistivity $\rho_0(T) \sim T^v$. From
concurrent measurements of the transverse $\rho_{xx}(T)$ and Hall
$\rho_{xy}(T)$ magnetoresistivities, we reveal a clear correlation between the
rapidly increasing $\rho_{xy}(T)$ and the occurrence of a peak in the
$\rho_{xx}(T)$ curve. Quantitative analysis indicates that the reentrant
metallic behavior arises from the competition of the magneto conductivity
$\sigma_{xx}(T)$ with an additional component
$\Delta\sigma_{xx}(T)=\kappa_H\sigma_{xx}(T)$ where
$\kappa_H=[\rho_{xy}(T)/\rho_{xx}(T)]^2$ is the Hall factor. We find that the
Hall factor ($\kappa_H \approx 0.4$) at peak temperature $T_p$ is nearly
field-independent, leading to the observed $T_p(H)$ relationship. Furthermore,
the reentrant metallic behavior in $\rho_{xx}(T)$ also is reflected in the
behavior of $\rho_{xx}(H)$ that ranges from non-saturating at $T>70$ K to
saturation at liquid helium temperatures. The latter can be explained with the
magnetic field dependence of the Hall factor $\kappa_H(H)$. Our studies
demonstrate that a semiclassical theory can account for the 'anomalies' in the
magnetotransport phenomena of NbP without invoking an exotic mechanism.

to which networks from all standard chaotic attractors are found to belong. In
addition, we present generalized definitions for clustering coefficient and
characteristic path length and show that these measures can effectively
discriminate chaotic dynamics from white noise and $1/f$ colored noise. Our

bond-center (BC) site of Si-C bonds in the He-implanted 3C-\b{eta} SiC.
Analysis on the electronic structures reveals that such change is attributed to
the reduction of hybridization of C-Si bonds induced by He. Moreover, the
presence of He strongly affect the vibrational features in the high frequency
region, causing a blue shift of 25 cm-1 for C-H stretch mode with H at ABc site
and a red shift of 165cm-1 for that at BC site, with respect to that in the
pure system. In pure 3C-\b{eta} SiC, H is diffusive with an energy cost of
about 0.5 eV, preferring to rotate around the C atom in a Si-C tetrahedron with
an energy barrier of just about 0.10 eV. In contrast, in He-implanted
3C-\b{eta} SiC, the energy barriers for H migration goes up to be about 0.95

the steady-state efficiency and the dynamic performance. This paper addresses
the issue of obtaining an optimal equilibrium in terms of some steady-state
operation criteria for a Lur'e-type system and such an equilibrium can also
guarantee a sufficiently large stability region in the dynamic domain such that
the system can tolerate some given disturbance. For this purpose, a set of
computationally tractable algebraic constraints, which can properly represent
the stability certificate under the optimization framework, are proposed. The
existing methods formulate the dynamic performance under the optimization
framework by discretizing the differential-algebraic equations, which are
computationally intractable for large-scale Lur'e systems like power grids.
Dissimilarly, the introduced approach first constructs the stability region
based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. Then, a novel method is proposed to
project the stability region onto the feasible domain of the optimization
problem such that the stability certificate can be incorporated into the
optimization framework easily. In the transient stability-constrained optimal
power flow (TSCOPF) problem of power systems, researchers look for a
steady-state operating point with the minimum generation costs that can
maintain system stability under some given transient disturbances. The proposed
approach is applied to develop a scalable TSCOPF framework for power systems.
The TSCOPF model is tested on the IEEE 118-Bus power system.

of sequences through analytic properties of their generating functions, has led
to the development of deep and powerful tools with applications across
mathematics and the natural sciences. In addition to the now classical
univariate theory, recent work in the study of analytic combinatorics in
several variables (ACSV) has shown how to derive asymptotics for the
coefficients of certain D-finite functions represented by diagonals of
multivariate rational functions. We give a pedagogical introduction to the
methods of ACSV from a computer algebra viewpoint, developing rigorous
algorithms and giving the first complexity results in this area under
conditions which are broadly satisfied. Furthermore, we give several new
applications of ACSV to the enumeration of lattice walks restricted to certain
regions. In addition to proving several open conjectures on the asymptotics of
such walks, a detailed study of lattice walk models with weighted steps is
undertaken.

labeling $f : V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ such that every vertex with label
$0$ has a neighbor with label $2$. The weight $f(V(G))$ of a RD-function $f$ on
$G$ is the value $\Sigma_{v\in V(G)} f (v)$. The {\em Roman domination number}
$\gamma_{R}(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum weight of a RD-function on $G$. The six
classes of graphs resulting from the changing or unchanging of the Roman
domination number of a graph when a vertex is deleted, or an edge is deleted or
added are considered. We consider relationships among the classes, which are
illustrated in a Venn diagram. A graph $G$ is Roman domination $k$-critical if
the removal of any set of $k$ vertices decreases the Roman domination number.
Some initial properties of these graphs are studied. The $\gamma_R$-graph of a
graph $G$ is any graph which vertex set is the collection $\mathscr{D}_R(G)$ of
all minimum weight RD-functions on $G$. We define adjacency between any two
elements of $\mathscr{D}_R(G)$ in several ways, and initiate the study of the
obtained $\gamma_R$-graphs.

benthic organisms also actively pulse to enhance feeding and exchange. One
example is the pulsing soft coral (Heteroxenia fuscescens). Pulsing corals live
in colonies, where each polyp actively pulses through contraction and
relaxation of their tentacles. The pulses are typically out of phase and
without a clear pattern. These corals live in lagoons and bays found in the Red
Sea and Indian Ocean where they at times experience strong ambient flows. In
this paper, $3D$ fluid-structure interaction simulations are used to quantify
the effects of ambient flow on the exchange currents produced by the active
contraction of pulsing corals. We find a complex interaction between the flows
produced by the coral and the background flow. The dynamics can either enhance

also slows the average horizontal flow near the polyp when there is a strong
background flow. The dynamics of these flows have implications for particle

improves individualized estimation efficiency and feature selection accuracy.
Moreover, the proposed model also incorporates within-individual correlation

theoretical foundation under a double-divergence modeling framework where the
number of individuals and the number of individual-wise measurements can both
diverge, which enables inference on both an individual level and a population

an optimal control policy for DC cooling system is a challenging task. The
prevailing approaches often rely on approximating system models that are built
upon the knowledge of mechanical cooling, electrical and thermal management,
which is difficult to design and may lead to sub-optimal or unstable
performances. In this paper, we propose utilizing the large amount of
monitoring data in DC to optimize the control policy. To do so, we cast the
cooling control policy design into an energy cost minimization problem with
temperature constraints, and tap it into the emerging deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end cooling
control algorithm (CCA) that is based on the actor-critic framework and an
off-policy offline version of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
algorithm. In the proposed CCA, an evaluation network is trained to predict an
energy cost counter penalized by the cooling status of the DC room, and a
policy network is trained to predict optimized control settings when gave the
current load and weather information. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on
the EnergyPlus simulation platform and on a real data trace collected from the
National Super Computing Centre (NSCC) of Singapore. Our results show that the
proposed CCA can achieve about 11% cooling cost saving on the simulation
platform compared with a manually configured baseline control algorithm. In the
trace-based study, we propose a de-underestimation validation mechanism as we
cannot directly test the algorithm on a real DC. Even though with DUE the
results are conservative, we can still achieve about 15% cooling energy saving
on the NSCC data trace if we set the inlet temperature threshold at 26.6 degree

Positive selection is typically a heterogeneous process, i.e., it acts on some
branches of the evolutionary tree and not others. Previous work on DNA models
showed that when evolution occurs under a heterogeneous process it is important
to consider the property of model closure, because non-closed models can give
biased estimates of evolutionary processes. The existing codon models that
account for the genetic code are not closed; to establish this it is enough to
show that they are not linear (meaning that the sum of two codon rate matrices
in the model is not a matrix in the model). This raises the concern that a
single codon model fit to a heterogeneous process might mis-estimate both the
effect of selection and branch lengths.
  Codon models are typically constructed by choosing an underlying DNA model
(e.g., HKY) that acts identically and independently at each codon position, and
then applying the genetic code via the parameter $\omega$ to modify the rate of
transitions between codons that code for different amino acids. Here we use
simulation to investigate the accuracy of estimation of both the selection
parameter $\omega$ and branch lengths in cases where the underlying DNA process
is heterogeneous but $\omega$ is constant. We find that both $\omega$ and
branch lengths can be mis-estimated in these scenarios. Errors in $\omega$ were
usually less than 2% but could be as high as 17%. We also assessed if choosing
different underlying DNA models had any affect on accuracy, in particular we
assessed if using closed DNA models gave any advantage. However, a DNA model
being closed does not imply that the codon model constructed from it is closed,
and in general we found that using closed DNA models did not decrease errors in
the estimation of $\omega$.

non-linear subspaces. To handle data clustering from the non-linear subspaces,
a kernelization method is designed by mapping the data from the original input
space to a new feature space in which the transformed data can be clustered by
a multiple linear clustering method. In this paper, we make an optimization
model for the kernelized multi-view self-representation clustering problem. We
also develop a new efficient algorithm based on the alternation direction
method and infer a closed-form solution. Since all the subproblems can be
solved exactly, the proposed optimization algorithm is guaranteed to obtain the
optimal solution. In particular, the original tensor-based multi-view
self-representation clustering problem is a special case of our approach and
can be solved by our algorithm. Experimental results on several popular
real-world clustering datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the

of indirect noise in multicomponent gases. First, from non-equilibrium
thermodynamics relations, it is shown that a compositional inhomogeneity
advected in an accelerating flow is a source of sound induced by
inhomogeneities in the mixture (i) chemical potentials and (ii) specific heat
capacities. Second, it is shown that the acoustic, entropy and compositional
linear perturbations evolve independently from each other and they become
coupled through mean-flow gradients and/or at the boundaries. Third, the
equations are cast in invariant formulation and a mathematical solution is
found by asymptotic expansion of path-ordered integrals with an infinite radius
of convergence. Finally, the transfer functions are calculated for a supersonic
nozzle with finite spatial extent perturbed by a methane-air compositional
inhomogeneity. The proposed framework will help identify and quantify the
sources of sound in nozzles with relevance, for example, to aeronautical gas
turbines.

are avoided through either a change to 1st order transitions or through an
intervening spin-density-wave (SDW) phase. Here, we study the prototype of the

to decompose the controller into two components: (i)~a path controller, which
modulates the parameterization of the desired path in an online manner,
yielding a reference trajectory; and (ii)~a tracking controller, which takes
the reference trajectory and outputs joint torques for tracking. However, there
is one major difficulty: the path controller might not find any feasible

archaeology. One of the approaches of this technique is based on the well-known
radiography principle, by reconstructing the incident direction of the detected
muons after crossing the studied objects. In this case, muons detected after a
previous forward scattering on the object surface represent an irreducible
background noise, leading to a bias on the measurement and consequently on the
reconstruction of the object mean density. Therefore, a prior characterization
of this effect represents valuable information to conveniently correct the
obtained results. Although the muon scattering process has been already
theoretically described, a general study of this process has been carried out
based on Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in a versatile tool to evaluate
this effect for different object geometries and compositions. As an example,
these simulations have been used to evaluate the impact of forward scattered
muons on two different applications of muon imaging: archaeology and
volcanology, revealing a significant impact on the latter case. The general way

video clip. In reality, there often exist multiple human actions in a video
stream. Such a video stream is often weakly-annotated with a set of relevant
human action labels at a global level rather than assigning each label to a
specific video episode corresponding to a single action, which leads to a
multi-label learning problem. Furthermore, there are many meaningful human
actions in reality but it would be extremely difficult to collect/annotate
video clips regarding all of various human actions, which leads to a zero-shot
learning scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that has
addressed all the above issues together in human action recognition. In this
paper, we formulate a real-world human action recognition task as a multi-label
zero-shot learning problem and propose a framework to tackle this problem in a
holistic way. Our framework holistically tackles the issue of unknown temporal
boundaries between different actions for multi-label learning and exploits the
side information regarding the semantic relationship between different human
actions for knowledge transfer. Consequently, our framework leads to a joint
latent ranking embedding for multi-label zero-shot human action recognition. A
novel neural architecture of two component models and an alternate learning
algorithm are proposed to carry out the joint latent ranking embedding
learning. Thus, multi-label zero-shot recognition is done by measuring
relatedness scores of action labels to a test video clip in the joint latent
visual and semantic embedding spaces. We evaluate our framework with different
settings, including a novel data split scheme designed especially for
evaluating multi-label zero-shot learning, on two datasets: Breakfast and
Charades. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework.

Question-and-Answer (Q&A) instances. However, not all instances and topics
receive the same amount of attention, as some thrive and achieve
self-sustaining levels of activity, while others fail to attract users and
either never grow beyond being a small niche community or become inactive.
Hence, it is imperative to not only better understand but also to distill
deciding factors and rules that define and govern sustainable Q&A instances. We
aim to empower community managers with quantitative methods for them to better
understand, control and foster their communities, and thus contribute to making
the Web a more efficient place to exchange information. To that end, we
extract, model and cluster user activity-based time series from $50$ randomly
selected Q&A instances from the Stack Exchange network to characterize user
behavior. We find four distinct types of user activity temporal patterns, which
vary primarily according to the users' activity frequency. Finally, by breaking
down total activity in our 50 Q&A instances by the previously identified user
activity profiles, we classify those 50 Q&A instances into three different
activity profiles. Our parsimonious categorization of Q&A instances aligns with
the stage of development and maturity of the underlying communities, and can
potentially help operators of such instances: We not only quantitatively assess
progress of Q&A instances, but we also derive practical implications for
optimizing Q&A community building efforts, as we e.g. recommend which user
types to focus on at different developmental stages of a Q&A community.

system for optoelectronics: tungsten disulphide WS$_2$ on epitaxial graphene
(EG) on SiC(0001). The WS$_2$ is grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) onto
the EG. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements assign the
zero-degree orientation as the preferential azimuthal alignment for WS$_2$/EG.
The valence-band (VB) structure emerging from this alignment is investigated by
means of photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, with both high space and
energy resolution. We find that the spin-orbit splitting of monolayer WS$_2$ on
graphene is of 462 meV, larger than what is reported to date for other
substrates. We determine the value of the work function for the WS$_2$/EG to be
4.5$\pm$0.1 eV. A large shift of the WS$_2$ VB maximum is observed as well ,
due to the lowering of the WS$_2$ work function caused by the donor-like
interfacial states of EG. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried
out on a coincidence supercell confirm the experimental band structure to an
excellent degree. X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) measurements
performed on single WS$_2$ crystals confirm the van der Waals nature of the
interface coupling between the two layers. In virtue of its band alignment and
large spin-orbit splitting, this system gains strong appeal for optical
spin-injection experiments and opto-spintronic applications in general.

this issue in the context of a simplified Agent Based Model of the economy.
Depending on the value of the parameters that describe the behaviour of agents
(in particular inflation anticipations), we find a rich variety of behaviour at
the macro-level. Without any active monetary policy, our ABM economy can be in
a high inflation/high output state, or in a low inflation/low output state.
Hyper-inflation, deflation and ""business cycles"" between coexisting states are
also found. We then introduce a Central Bank with a Taylor rule-based inflation
target, and study the resulting aggregate variables. Our main result is that
too-low inflation targets are in general detrimental to a CB-monitored economy.
One symptom is a persistent under-realisation of inflation, perhaps similar to
the current macroeconomic situation. Higher inflation targets are found to
improve both unemployment and negative interest rate episodes. Our results are
compared with the predictions of the standard DSGE model.

remain tractable and yield parsimonious models by imposing strong assumptions
on the data. Vine copulas are more flexible by combining arbitrary marginal
distributions and (conditional) bivariate copulas. Yet, this adaptability is
accompanied by sharply increasing computational effort as the dimension
increases. The approach proposed in this paper overcomes this burden and makes
the first step into ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence modeling by
using a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we apply Gaussian methods to split
datasets into feasibly small subsets and second, apply parsimonious and
flexible vine copulas thereon. Finally, we reconcile them into one joint model.
We provide numerical results demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in
moderate dimensions and showcase its ability to estimate ultra high dimensional
non-Gaussian dependence models in thousands of dimensions.

computing the entries of $f(A)$ requires a significant computational effort. In
this work we address the problem of estimating the changes in the entries of
$f(A)$ with respect to changes in the edge structure. Intuition suggests that,
if the topology of connections in the new graph $\tilde G$ is not significantly
distorted, relevant components in $G$ maintain their leading role in $\tilde
G$. We propose several bounds giving mathematical reasoning to such intuition
and showing, in particular, that the magnitude of the variation of the entry
$f(A)_{k\ell}$ decays exponentially with the shortest-path distance in $G$ that
separates either $k$ or $\ell$ from the set of nodes touched by the edges that
are perturbed. Moreover, we propose a simple method that exploits the
computation of $f(A)$ to simultaneously compute the all-pairs shortest-path
distances of $G$, with essentially no additional cost. As the nodes whose edge
connection tends to change more often or tends to be more often affected by
noise have marginal role in the graph and are distant from the most central
nodes, the proposed bounds are particularly relevant.

target locations is strongly dependent upon molecular motor-assisted motion
along the cytoskeleton. Radial transport along microtubules and lateral
transport along the filaments of the actin cortex underneath the cell membrane
are characteristic for cells with a centrosome. The interplay between the
specific cytoskeleton organization and the motor performance realizes a
spatially inhomogeneous intermittent search strategy. In order to analyze the
efficiency of such intracellular search strategies we formulate a random
velocity model with intermittent arrest states. We evaluate efficiency in terms
of mean first passage times for three different, frequently encountered
intracellular transport tasks: i) the narrow escape problem, which emerges
during cargo transport to a synapse or other specific region of the cell
membrane, ii) the reaction problem, which considers the binding time of two
particles within the cell, and iii) the reaction-escape problem, which arises
when cargo must be released at a synapse only after pairing with another
particle. Our results indicate that cells are able to realize efficient search
strategies for various intracellular transport tasks economically through a
spatial cytoskeleton organization that involves only a narrow actin cortex
rather than a cell body filled with randomly oriented actin filaments.

account are the ones that suitably approach, at infinity, Minkowski space-time.
In particular we will focus on asymptotically flat space-times. In this work
the concept of asymptotic symmetry group of those space-times will be studied.
In the first two sections we derive the asymptotic group following the
classical approach which was basically developed by Bondi, van den Burg,
Metzner and Sachs. This is essentially the group of transformations between
coordinate systems of a certain type in asymptotically flat space-times. In the
third section the conformal method and the notion of asymptotic simplicity are
introduced, following mainly the works of Penrose. This section prepares us for
another derivation of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group which will involve the
conformal structure, and is thus more geometrical and fundamental. In the
subsequent sections we discuss the properties of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group,
e.g. its algebra and the possibility to obtain as its subgroup the Poincar\'e
group, as we may expect. The paper ends with a review of the
Bondi-Metzner-Sachs invariance properties of classical gravitational scattering
discovered by Strominger, that are finding application to black hole physics
and quantum gravity in the literature.

repulsion with applications in various machine learning tasks including
summarization and search. However, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference for
DPP which plays an important role in many applications is NP-hard, and even the
popular greedy algorithm can still be too computationally expensive to be used
in large-scale real-time scenarios. To overcome the computational challenge, in
this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to greatly accelerate the greedy MAP
inference for DPP. In addition, our algorithm also adapts to scenarios where
the repulsion is only required among nearby few items in the result sequence.
We apply the proposed algorithm to generate relevant and diverse
recommendations. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is
significantly faster than state-of-the-art competitors, and provides a better
relevance-diversity trade-off on several public datasets, which is also
confirmed in an online A/B test.

so-called melonic graph amplitudes. Enhanced tensor models extend tensor models
with special scalings of their interactions which allow, in the same limit,
that the sub-dominant amplitudes to be ""enhanced"", that is to be as dominant as
the melonic ones. These models were introduced to explore new large $N$ limits
and to probe different phases for tensor models. Tensor field theory is the
quantum field theoretic counterpart of tensor models and enhanced tensor field
theory enlarges this theory space to accommodate enhanced tensor interactions.
We undertake the multi-scale renormalization analysis for two types of enhanced
quartic melonic theories with rank $d$ tensor fields $\phi: (U(1)^{D})^{d} \to
\mathbb{C}$ and with interactions of the form $p^{2a}\phi^4$ reminiscent of
derivative couplings expressed in momentum space. Scrutinizing the degree of
divergence of both theories, we identify generic conditions for their
renormalizability at all orders of perturbation. For a first type of theory, we
identify a 2-parameter space of just-renormalizable models for generic $(d,D)$.
These models have dominant non-melonic four-point functions. Finally, by
specifying the parameters, we detail the renormalization analysis of a second
type of model. Lying in between just- and super-renormalizability, that model
is more exotic: all four-point amplitudes are convergent, however it exhibits
an infinite family of divergent two-point amplitudes.

generated by independent random variables, though this model of events is
applicable to almost all applications of LLL. We introduce a necessary and
sufficient criterion for variable-LLL, in terms of the probabilities of the
events and the event-variable graph specifying the dependency among the events.
Based on this new criterion, we obtain boundaries for two families of
event-variable graphs, namely, cyclic and treelike bigraphs. These are the
first two non-trivial cases where the variable-LLL boundary is fully
determined. As a byproduct, we also provide a universal constructive method to
find a set of events whose union has the maximum probability, given the
probability vector and the event-variable graph. Though it is #P-hard in
general to determine variable-LLL boundaries, we can to some extent decide
whether a gap exists between a variable-LLL boundary and the corresponding
abstract-LLL boundary. In particular, we show that the gap existence can be
decided without solving Shearer's conditions or checking our variable-LLL
criterion. Equipped with this powerful theorem, we show that there is no gap if
the base graph of the event-variable graph is a tree, while gap appears if the
base graph has an induced cycle of length at least 4. The problem is almost
completely solved except when the base graph has only 3-cliques, in which case
we also get partial solutions. A set of reduction rules are established that
facilitate to infer gap existence of an event-variable graph from known ones.
As an application, various event-variable graphs, in particular combinatorial

simplicity, the density distribution is assumed to be symmetric around the
axis. Also for simplicity, the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform
and turbulence is not taken into account. The perturbation equation is
formulated to be an eigenvalue problem. The growth rate is obtained as a
function of the wavenumber for fragmentation along the axis and the magnetic
field strength. The growth rate depends critically on the outer boundary. If
the displacement vanishes in the region very far from the cloud axis (fixed
boundary), cloud fragmentation is suppressed by a moderate magnetic field,
which means the plasma beta is below 1.67 on the cloud axis. If the
displacement is constant along the magnetic field in the region very far from
the cloud, the cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is infinitely
strong. The cloud is deformed by circulation in the plane perpendicular to the
magnetic field. The unstable mode is not likely to induce dynamical collapse,
since it is excited even when the whole cloud is magnetically subcritical. For
both the boundary conditions the magnetic field increases the wavelength of the
most unstable mode. We find that the magnetic force suppresses compression
perpendicular to the magnetic field especially in the region of low density.

called correlated bursts, has recently been studied by measuring power-law
distributed bursty trains with exponent $\beta$. A scaling relation between
$\alpha$ and $\gamma$ has been established for the uncorrelated interevent
times, while little is known about the effects of correlated interevent times
on temporal correlations. In order to study these effects, we devise the
bursty-get-burstier model for correlated bursts, by which one can tune the
degree of correlations between interevent times, while keeping the same
interevent time distribution. We numerically find that sufficiently strong
correlations between interevent times could violate the scaling relation
between $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ for the uncorrelated case. A non-trivial
dependence of $\gamma$ on $\beta$ is also found for some range of $\alpha$. The
implication of our results is discussed in terms of the hierarchical
organization of bursty trains at various timescales.

atoms at or close to unitarity and neutron matter are determined using a
recently proposed Density Functional Theory (DFT) based on the s-wave
scattering length $a_s$, effective range $r_e$, and unitary gas limit. In cold
atoms, when the effective range may be neglected, we show that the pressure,
chemical potential, compressibility modulus and sound velocity obtained with
the DFT are compatible with experimental observations or exact theoretical
estimates. The static response in homogeneous infinite systems is also obtained
and a possible influence of the effective range on the response is analyzed.
The neutron matter differs from unitary gas due to the non infinite scattering
length and to a significant influence of effective range which affects all
thermodynamical quantities as well as the static response. In particular, we
show for neutron matter that the latter response recently obtained in
Auxiliary-Field Diffusion Monte-Carlo (AFDMC) can be qualitatively reproduced
when the p-wave contribution is added to the functional. Our study indicates
that the close similarity between the exact AFDMC static response and the free
gas response might stems from the compensation of the $a_s$ effect by the
effective range and p-wave contributions. We finally consider the dynamical
response of both atoms or neutron droplets in anisotropic traps. Assuming the
hydrodynamical regime and a polytropic equation of state, a reasonable
description of the radial and axial collective frequencies in cold atoms is
obtained. Following a similar strategy, we estimate the equivalent collective
frequencies of neutron drops in anisotropic traps.

Contrary to traditional networks which are designed to handle human driven

phenomenon when the flow in a road network can be impeded by adding a new road
or, more generally, the overall net performance can degrade after addition of
an extra available choice. In this work, we discuss the possibility of a
similar effect in a phase-coherent quantum transport and demonstrate it by
example of a simple Y-shaped metallic fork. To reveal the Braess-like partial
suppression of the charge flow in such device, it is proposed to transfer two
outgoing arms into a superconducting state. We show that the differential
conductance-vs-voltage spectrum of the hybrid fork structure varies
considerably when the extra link between the two superconducting leads is added
and it can serve as an indicator of quantum correlations which manifest
themselves in the quantum Braess paradox.

connected through a fronthaul to baseband controllers is a promising solution.
However, the fronthaul links must support high bit rates as 5G networks are
projected to use wide bandwidths and many antennas. Upgrading all of the
existing fronthaul connections would be cumbersome, while replacing the remote
radio head and upgrading the software in the baseband controllers is relatively
simple. In this paper, we consider the uplink and seek the answer to the
question: If we have a fixed fronthaul capacity and can deploy any technology
in the remote radio head, what is the optimal technology? In particular, we
optimize the number of antennas, quantization bits and bandwidth to maximize
the sum rate under a fronthaul capacity constraint. The analytical results
suggest that operating with many antennas equipped with low-resolution
analog-to-digital converters, while the interplay between number of antennas
and bandwidth depends on various parameters. The numerical analysis provides
further insights into the design of communication systems with limited
fronthaul capacity.

comparing the physical state of the plasma at its propagation through the
broad-line region (where the jet is most likely formed) into the intergalactic
medium, where it starts to significantly decelerate. Aims. We compare the
constraints on the physical parameters in the innermost ($\leq$ pc) and outer
($\geq$ kpc) regions of the 3C 120 jet by means of a detailed multiwavelength
analysis and theoretical modeling of their broadband spectra. Methods.The data
collected by Fermi LAT, Swift and Chandra are analyzed together and the
spectral energy distributions are modeled using a leptonic synchrotron and
inverse Compton model, taking into account the seed photons originating inside
and outside of the jet. The model parameters are estimated using the MCMC
method. Results. The $\gamma$-ray flux from the inner jet of 3C 120 was
characterized by rapid variation from MJD 56900 to MJD 57300. Two strong flares
were observed on April 24, 2015 when, within 19.0 minutes and 3.15 hours the
flux was as high as $(7.46\pm1.56)\times10^{-6}photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}$ and
$(4.71\pm0.92)\times10^{-6}photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}$ respectively. The broadband
emission in the quiet and flaring states can be described as SSC emission while
IC scattering of dusty torus photons cannot be excluded for the flaring states.
The X-ray emission from the knots can be well reproduced by IC scattering of
CMB photons only if the jet is highly relativistic (since even when $\delta=10$
still $U_{\rm e}/U_B\geq80$). These extreme requirements can be somewhat
softened assuming the X-rays are from the synchrotron emission of a second
population of very-high-energy electrons. Conclusions. We found that the jet
power estimated at two scales is consistent, suggesting that the jet does not
suffer severe dissipation, it simply becomes radiatively inefficient.

field from the low solar corona into interplanetary space. These eruptions are
often associated with the acceleration of energetic electrons which produce
various sources of high intensity plasma emission. In relatively rare cases,
the energetic electrons may also produce gyrosynchrotron emission from within
the CME itself, allowing for a diagnostic of the CME magnetic field strength.
Such a magnetic field diagnostic is important for evaluating the total magnetic
energy content of the CME, which is ultimately what drives the eruption. Here
we report on an unusually large source of gyrosynchrotron radiation in the form
of a type IV radio burst associated with a CME occurring on 2014-September-01,
observed using instrumentation from the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Astronomy Facility. A
combination of spectral flux density measurements from the Nan\c{c}ay
instruments and the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) from 300MHz to 5 GHz
reveals a gyrosynchrotron spectrum with a peak flux density at $>$1 GHz. Using
this radio analysis, a model for gyrosynchrotron radiation, a non-thermal
electron density diagnostic using the Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and
images of the eruption from the GOES Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), we are able to
calculate both the magnetic field strength and the properties of the X-ray and
radio emitting energetic electrons within the CME. We find the radio emission
is produced by non-thermal electrons of energies >1MeV with a spectral index of
$\delta$$\sim$3 in a CME magnetic field of 4.4 G at a height of 1.3
R$_{\odot}$, while the X-ray emission is produced from a similar distribution
of electrons but with much lower energies on the order of 10 keV. We conclude
by comparing X-ray and radio-emitting electron distributions and how such an

appearance variations incurred by various real-world occlusions. This paper
introduces an Adversarial Occlusion-aware Face Detector (AOFD) by
simultaneously detecting occluded faces and segmenting occluded areas.
Specifically, we employ an adversarial training strategy to generate
occlusion-like face features that are difficult for a face detector to
recognize. Occlusion mask is predicted simultaneously while detecting occluded
faces and the occluded area is utilized as an auxiliary instead of being
regarded as a hindrance. Moreover, the supervisory signals from the
segmentation branch will reversely affect the features, aiding in detecting
heavily-occluded faces accordingly. Consequently, AOFD is able to find the
faces with few exposed facial landmarks with very high confidences and keeps

different ecosystem models that attempt to represent their dynamics in a
detailed mechanistic way. Each of these can be used as simulators of
large-scale experiments and make forecasts about the fate of ecosystems under
different scenarios in order to support the development of appropriate
management strategies. However, structural differences, systematic
discrepancies and uncertainties lead to different models giving different
predictions under these scenarios. This is further complicated by the fact that
the models may not be run with the same species or functional groups, spatial
structure or time scale. Rather than simply trying to select a 'best' model, or
taking some weighted average, it is important to exploit the strengths of each
of the available models, while learning from the differences between them. To
achieve this, we construct a flexible statistical model of the relationships
between a collection or 'ensemble' of mechanistic models and their biases,
allowing for structural and parameter uncertainty and for different ways of
representing reality. Using this statistical meta-model, we can combine prior
beliefs, model estimates and direct observations using Bayesian methods, and
make coherent predictions of future outcomes under different scenarios with
robust measures of uncertainty. In this paper we present the modelling
framework and discuss results obtained using a diverse ensemble of models in
scenarios involving future changes in fishing levels. These examples illustrate
the value of our approach in predicting outcomes for possible strategies
pertaining to climate and fisheries policy aimed at improving food security and
maintaining ecosystem integrity.

Valley-dependent pseudospin bands are achieved in three-dimensional metacrystal

for global analysis of extremely extended cosmic-ray phenomena, so-called

observatories. To date cosmic-ray research has been focused on detecting single
air showers, while the search for ensembles of cosmic-ray events induced by
super-preshowers is a scientific terra incognita - CREDO explores this
uncharted realm. Positive detection of super-preshowers would have an impact on
ultra-high energy astrophysics, cosmology and the physics of fundamental
particle interactions as they can theoretically be formed within both classical
(photon-photon interactions) and exotic (Super Heavy Dark Matter particle decay
and interaction) scenarios. Some super-preshowers are predicted to have a
significant spatial extent - a unique signature only detectable with the
existing cosmic-ray infrastructure taken as a global network. An obvious,
although yet unprobed, super-preshower 'detection limit' would be located
somewhere between an air shower, induced by a super-preshower composed of
tightly collimated particles, and a super-preshower composed of particles
spread so widely that only few of them can reach the Earth. CREDO will probe
this detection limit, leading to either an observation of an as yet unseen
physical phenomenon, or the setting upper limits to the existence of large
extraterrestrial cascades which would constrain fundamental physics models.
While CREDO's focus is on testing physics at energies close to the Grand
Unified Theories range, the broader phenomena are expected to be composed of
particles with energies ranging from GeV to ZeV. This motivates our advertising
of this concept across the astroparticle physics community.

process based on a superconducting quantum circuit, where two coupled flux
qubits longitudinally interact with the same resonator. We show that this
simultaneous excitation of two qubits (assuming that the sum of their

counter-rotating terms in the dipole-dipole coupling between two qubits, and
the standard rotating-wave approximation is not valid here. By numerically
simulating the adiabatic Landau-Zener transition and Rabi-oscillation effects,
we clearly verify that the energy of a single photon can excite two qubits via
higher-order transitions induced by the longitudinal couplings and the
counter-rotating terms. Compared with previous studies, the coherent dynamics
in our system only involves one intermediate state and, thus, exhibits a much
faster rate. We also find transition paths which can interfere. Finally, by
discussing how to control the two longitudinal-coupling strengths, we find a
method to observe both constructive and destructive interference phenomena in
our system.

formalisms, extrinsic curvature tensor is kept fixed at the boundary, a
modified Horowitz' formalism fixes Ricci scalar, instead. It has been taken as
granted that the Hamiltonian structure corresponding to all the formalisms with
different end-point data are either the same or are canonically equivalent. In
the present study, we show that indeed it is true, but only for a class of
higher order theory. However, for more general higher order theories, e.g.
dilatonic coupled Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of curvature squared
term, the Hamiltonian obtained following modified Horowitz' formalism is found
to be different from the others, and is not related under canonical

neighbourhood of a point $x$, it is sufficient by Taylor's theorem to know the
value of the function as well as all of its derivatives up to the required
order at the point $x$ itself. In other words, one could say that a regular
function is locally modelled by the set of polynomials. The theory of
regularity structures due to Hairer generalizes this observation and provides
an abstract setup, which in the application of singular SPDE extends the set of
polynomials by functionals constructed from, e.g., white noise. In this
context, the notion of Taylor polynomials is lifted to the notion of so-called
modelled distributions. The celebrated reconstruction theorem, which in turn
was inspired by Gubinelli's sewing lemma, is of paramount importance for the
theory. It enables to reconstruct a modelled distribution as a true
distribution on $R^d$ which is locally approximated by this extended set of
models or ""monomials"". In the original work of Hairer, the error is measured
based on H\""{o}lder norms. This was then generalized to the whole scale of

the pixel capacitance, the number of pixels and the correlated noise. Central
to the method is the concept of the pixel occupancy, the probability of a

dynamic updating framework that allows for the training of cost models during

efficiency by allowing highly transcriber-adaptive cost modeling. We first
confirm and analyze the improvements afforded by this method in a simulated

improvements of 15% relative on average, and 42% for the participants who
deviated most strongly from our initial, transcriber-agnostic cost model.

have a large influence on the transcriber's working behavior.

stretchable electronics or batteries, smart textiles, biomedical devices,
tissue engineering and soft robotics. Recent attempts to design such materials,
via e.g. micro-patterning of wavy fibres on soft substrates, polymer
engineering at the molecular level or even kirigami techniques, provide
appealing prospects but suffer drawbacks impacting the material viability:
complexity of manufacturing, fatigue or failure upon cycling, restricted range
of materials or biological incompatibility. Here, we report a universal
strategy to design highly stretchable, self-assembling and fatigue-resistant
synthetic fabrics. Our approach finds its inspiration in the mechanics of
living animal cells that routinely encounter and cope with extreme
deformations, e.g. with the engulfment of large intruders by macrophages,
squeezing and stretching of immune cells in tiny capillaries or
shrinking/swelling of neurons upon osmotic stimuli. All these large instant
deformations are actually mediated and buffered by membrane reserves available
in the form of microvilli, membrane folds or endomembrane that can be recruited
on demand. We synthetically mimicked this behavior by creating nanofibrous
liquid-infused tissues spontaneously forming surface reserves whose unfolding
fuels any imposed shape change. Our process, relying only on geometry,
elasticity and capillarity, allows to endow virtually any material with high
stretchability and reversibility, making it straightforward to implement
additional mechanical, electrical or chemical functions. We illustrate this
with proof-of-concept activable capillary muscles, adaptable slippery liquid
infused porous surfaces and stretchable basic printed electronic circuits.

(CREDO) is the detection and analysis of extended cosmic ray phenomena,
so-called super-preshowers (SPS), using existing as well as new infrastructure
(cosmic-ray observatories, educational detectors, single detectors etc.). The
search for ensembles of cosmic ray events initiated by SPS is yet an untouched
ground, in contrast to the current state-of-the-art analysis, which is focused
on the detection of single cosmic ray events. Theoretical explanation of SPS
could be given either within classical (e.g., photon-photon interaction) or
exotic (e.g., Super Heavy Dark Matter decay or annihilation) scenarios, thus
detection of SPS would provide a better understanding of particle physics, high
energy astrophysics and cosmology. The ensembles of cosmic rays can be
classified based on the spatial and temporal extent of particles constituting
the ensemble. Some classes of SPS are predicted to have huge spatial
distribution, a unique signature detectable only with a facility of the global
size. Since development and commissioning of a completely new facility with
such requirements is economically unwarranted and time-consuming, the global
analysis goals are achievable when all types of existing detectors are merged
into a worldwide network. The idea to use the instruments in operation is based
on a novel trigger algorithm: in parallel to looking for neighbour surface
detectors receiving the signal simultaneously, one should also look for
spatially isolated stations clustered in a small time window.

the thick-disc stellar population using a binary population-nucleosynthesis

distribution and surface abundances of carbon and nitrogen. We show that a few
per cent of thick-disc stars can interact in binary star systems and become
more massive than $1.3{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}$. Of these stars, most are single
because they are merged binaries. Some stars more massive than
$1.3{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}$ form in binaries by wind mass transfer. We compare
our results to a sample of the APOKASC data set and find reasonable agreement

nanocrystals of lateral size smaller than the Fermi wavelength of the 2D
electron gas at the surface of InAs, the electronic transmission of the
interface is weak; this leads to Coulomb blockade and enables the extraction of
the electron addition energy of the nanocrystals. For large nanocrystals, the
addition energy displays superconducting parity effect, a direct consequence of
Cooper pairing. Studying this parity effect as function of nanocrystal volume,
we find the suppression of Cooper pairing when the mean electronic level
spacing overcomes the superconducting gap energy, thus demonstrating
unambiguously the validity of the Anderson criterion.

  (ICDM), 2017",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detection of interesting (e.g., coherent or anomalous) clusters has been
studied extensively on plain or univariate networks, with various applications.
Recently, algorithms have been extended to networks with multiple attributes
for each node in the real-world. In a multi-attributed network, often, a
cluster of nodes is only interesting for a subset (subspace) of attributes, and
this type of clusters is called subspace clusters. However, in the current
literature, few methods are capable of detecting subspace clusters, which
involves concurrent feature selection and network cluster detection. These
relevant methods are mostly heuristic-driven and customized for specific
application scenarios.
  In this work, we present a generic and theoretical framework for detection of
interesting subspace clusters in large multi-attributed networks. Specifically,
we propose a subspace graph-structured matching pursuit algorithm, namely,
SG-Pursuit, to address a broad class of such problems for different score
functions (e.g., coherence or anomalous functions) and topology constraints
(e.g., connected subgraphs and dense subgraphs). We prove that our algorithm 1)
runs in nearly-linear time on the network size and the total number of
attributes and 2) enjoys rigorous guarantees (geometrical convergence rate and
tight error bound) analogous to those of the state-of-the-art algorithms for
sparse feature selection problems and subgraph detection problems. As a case
study, we specialize SG-Pursuit to optimize a number of well-known score
functions for two typical tasks, including detection of coherent dense and
anomalous connected subspace clusters in real-world networks. Empirical
evidence demonstrates that our proposed generic algorithm SG-Pursuit performs
superior over state-of-the-art methods that are designed specifically for these
two tasks.

$\pi_1(\rho):\pi_1(G)\to\pi_1(\mathrm{Homeo}(\mathcal{O}))$ is injective. This
strengthens a theorem of McDuff and Tolman (conjectured by Weinstein in 1989)
according to which the analogous map $G\to\mathrm{Ham}(\mathcal{O})$ is
injective on fundamental groups, where $\mathrm{Ham}(\mathcal{O})$ is the group
of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the standard symplectic structure on
$\mathcal{O}$. To prove our theorem we associate to every nontrivial element of
$\pi_1(G)$ a bundle over $S^2$ with fiber $\mathcal{O}$, using the standard
patching construction. We then prove that the resulting bundle is topologically

cannot have a trivial gapped ground state and is expected to host a gapless

dielectron decay channel and at forward rapidity ($2.5<y<4.0$) in the dimuon
channel, both down to zero transverse momentum. At forward rapidity, the
elliptic flow $v_2$ of the J/$\psi$ is studied as a function of transverse
momentum and centrality. A positive $v_2$ is observed in the transverse
momentum range $2 < p_{\rm T} < 8$ GeV/$c$ in the three centrality classes
studied and confirms with higher statistics our earlier results at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV in semi-central collisions. At mid-rapidity, the
J/$\psi$ $v_2$ is investigated as a function of transverse momentum in
semi-central collisions and found to be in agreement with the measurements at
forward rapidity. These results are compared to transport model calculations.
The comparison supports the idea that at low $p_{\rm T}$ the elliptic flow of
the J/$\psi$ originates from the thermalization of charm quarks in the
deconfined medium, but suggests that additional mechanisms might be missing in
the models.

pumping dynamics are fully coupled to an underlying electrophysiology model,
governed by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. Perturbing the diffusion parameter
in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model leads to a bifurcation in dynamics of action
potential propagation. This bifurcation is able to capture a spectrum of
different pumping regimes, with dynamic suction pumping and peristaltic-like

It is known that, for $\sigma>1$, there is no phase transition at any non-zero
temperature in this model. We prove rigorously that, for $\sigma>3/2$, any
Newman-Stein metastate for the ground states (i.e.\ the frequencies with which
distinct ground states are observed in finite size samples in the limit of
infinite size, for given disorder) is trivial and unique. In other words, for
given disorder and asymptotically at large sizes, the same ground state, or its
global spin flip, is obtained (almost) always. The proof consists of two parts:
one is a theorem (based on one by Newman and Stein for short-range
two-dimensional models), valid for all $\sigma>1$, that establishes triviality
under a convergence hypothesis on something similar to the energies of domain
walls, and the other (based on older results for the one-dimensional model)
establishes that the hypothesis is true for $\sigma>3/2$. In addition, we
derive heuristic scaling arguments and rigorous exponent inequalities which
tend to support the validity of the hypothesis under broader conditions. The
constructions of various metastates are extended to all values $\sigma>1/2$.
Triviality of the metastate in bond-diluted power-law models for $\sigma>1$ is
proved directly.

with the prevalent damped random walk (DRW, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

frequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low
frequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves
available. Meanwhile, quasars show too large scatter in their DRW parameters to
be attributed to the uncertainties in the measurements and the dependence of
variation to known physical factors. In this work we present simulations
showing that, if the low frequency PSD deviates from DRW, the red noise leakage
can naturally produce large scatter in variation parameters measured from
simulated light curves. The steeper the low frequency PSD slope is, the larger
scatter we expect. Based on the observations of SDSS Stripe 82 quasars, we find
the low frequency PSD slope should be no steeper than -1.3. The actual slope
could be flatter, which consequently requires that quasar variabilities should
be influenced by other unknown factors. We speculate that magnetic field and/or
metallicity could be such additional factors.

feasible, while ""barely-subquadratic"" times are generally infeasible. For
example, in the Euclidean metric, finding a Closest Pair among $n$ points in
${\mathbb R}^d$ is nearly-linear, solvable in $2^{O(d)} \cdot n \log^{O(1)} n$
time, while known algorithms for Furthest Pair (the diameter of the point set)
are only barely-subquadratic, requiring $\Omega(n^{2-1/\Theta(d)})$ time. Why
do these proximity problems have such different time complexities? Is there a
barrier to obtaining nearly-linear algorithms for problems which are currently
only barely-subquadratic?
  We give a novel exact and deterministic self-reduction for the Orthogonal
Vectors problem on $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^d$ to $n$ vectors in ${\mathbb
Z}^{\omega(\log d)}$ that runs in $2^{o(d)}$ time. As a consequence,
barely-subquadratic problems such as Euclidean diameter, Euclidean bichromatic
closest pair, ray shooting, and incidence detection do not have
$O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time algorithms (in Turing models of computation) for
dimensionality $d = \omega(\log \log n)^2$, unless the popular Orthogonal
Vectors Conjecture and the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis are false. That
is, while poly-log-log-dimensional Closest Pair is in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time, the
analogous case of Furthest Pair can encode larger-dimensional problems
conjectured to require $n^{2-o(1)}$ time. We also show that the All-Nearest
Neighbors problem in $\omega(\log n)$ dimensions requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to
solve, assuming either of the above conjectures.

problem in implementing artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we
address the notion of capacity with respect to Hopfield networks and propose a
dynamic approach to monitoring a network's capacity. We define our
understanding of capacity as the maximum number of stored patterns which can be
retrieved when probed by the stored patterns. Prior work in this area has
presented static expressions dependent on neuron count $N$, forcing network
designers to assume worst-case input characteristics for bias and correlation
when setting the capacity of the network. Instead, our model operates
simultaneously with the learning Hopfield network and concludes on a capacity
estimate based on the patterns which were stored. By continuously updating the
crosstalk associated with the stored patterns, our model guards the network
from overwriting its memory traces and exceeding its capacity. We simulate our
model using artificially generated random patterns, which can be set to a
desired bias and correlation, and observe capacity estimates between 93% and
97% accurate. As a result, our model doubles the memory efficiency of Hopfield
networks in comparison to the static and worst-case capacity estimate while
minimizing the risk of lost patterns.

constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). To be more specific,
the proposed PPS divides the search process into two different stages,
including the push and pull search stages. In the push stage, a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is adopted to explore the search space without
considering any constraints, which can help to get across infeasible regions
very fast and approach the unconstrained Pareto front. Furthermore, the
landscape of CMOPs with constraints can be probed and estimated in the push
stage, which can be utilized to conduct the parameters setting for
constraint-handling approaches applied in the pull stage. Then, a constrained
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) equipped with an improved
epsilon constraint-handling is applied to pull the infeasible individuals
achieved in the push stage to the feasible and non-dominated regions. Compared
with other CMOEAs, the proposed PPS method can more efficiently get across
infeasible regions and converge to the feasible and non-dominated regions by
applying push and pull search strategies at different stages. To evaluate the
performance regarding convergence and diversity, a set of benchmark CMOPs is
used to test the proposed PPS and compare with other five CMOEAs, including
MOEA/D-CDP, MOEA/D-SR, C-MOEA/D, MOEA/D-Epsilon and MOEA/D-IEpsilon. The
comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PPS achieves
significantly better or competitive performance than the other five CMOEAs on
most of the benchmark set.

parameter transfer learning to enhance the detection rate on longitudinal data.
We also combine the long short-term memory (LSTM) with CNN to model the
temporal patterns in a sequence of multi-axis signals. Further, we employ
ensemble learning to combine multiple LSTM learners into a more robust SMM

model of the beliefs, knowledge, goals, desires, emotions, etc.\ of these

for any positive rational number $k/n$, and for any given finite/co-finite set

network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field
belongs to the given set. For this purpose we construct two networks:
$\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{N}_2$; the network $\mathcal{N}_1$ has a $k/n$
fractional linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of
the finite field belongs to the given finite set of primes, and the network
$\mathcal{N}_2$ has a $k/n$ fractional linear network coding solution if and

  Recently, a method has been introduced where characteristic-dependent linear
rank inequalities are produced from networks whose linear coding capacity
depends on the characteristic of the finite field. By employing this method on
the networks $\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{N}_2$, we construct two classes of
characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities. For any given set of primes,
the first class contains an inequality which holds if the characteristic of the
finite field does not belong to the given set of primes but may not hold
otherwise; the second class contains an inequality which holds if the
characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set of primes but may
not hold otherwise. We then use these inequalities to obtain an upper-bound on
the linear coding capacity of $\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{N}_2$.

problem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second
presents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded
on the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in
the third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum
origin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two
of which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and
biosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and
experimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main
research themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a
physicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life
while the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the
essence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the
Information Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life
through replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is
fundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum
computation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto
replicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence
of quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve
the question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put
forward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in
the origin of genetic language.

to first find the user-BS association and bandwidth allocations. Then DBS
locations are updated using a heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm.
Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide
useful insights on the effects of traffic distributions and antenna beamwidth.

microscopic mechanisms responsible of glassy behavior. Some of the family
members show translational ordered phases with minimal disorder which appears
to reveal glassy features, thus deserving special attention in the search for
universal glass anomalies. In this work, we studied CBrCl$_3$ dynamics by
performing extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Molecules of this compound
perform reorientational discrete jumps, where the atoms exchange equivalent
positions among each other revealing a cage-orientational jump motion fully
comparable to the cage-rototranslational jump motion in supercooled liquids.
Correlation times were calculated from rotational autocorrelation functions
showing good agreement with previous reported dielectric results. From mean
waiting and persistence times calculated directly from trajectory results, we
are able to explain which microscopic mechanisms lead to characteristic times
associated with $\alpha$ and $\beta$-relaxation times measured experimentally.
We found that two nonequivalent groups of molecules have a longer
characteristic time than the other two nonequivalent groups, both of them
belonging to the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic (C2/c) lattice.

applications and high-speed wireless communications for their abilities of fast
beam scanning and complex beam pattern control. However, traditional PAAs based
on phase shifters suffer from the beam-squint problem and have limited
bandwidths. True-time-delay (TTD) beamforming based on low-loss photonic delay
lines can solve this problem. But it is still quite challenging to build
large-scale photonic TTD beamformers due to their high hardware complexity. In
this paper, we demonstrate a photonic TTD beamforming network based on a
miniature microresonator frequency comb (microcomb) source and dispersive time
delay. A method incorporating optical phase modulation and programmable
spectral shaping is proposed for positive and negative apodization weighting to
achieve arbitrary microwave beam pattern control. The experimentally
demonstrated TTD beamforming network can support a PAA with 21 elements. The
microwave frequency range is $\mathbf{8\sim20\ {GHz}}$, and the beam scanning
range is $\mathbf{\pm 60.2^\circ}$. Detailed measurements of the microwave
amplitudes and phases are performed. The beamforming performances of Gaussian,
rectangular beams and beam notch steering are evaluated through simulations by
assuming a uniform radiating antenna array. The scheme can potentially support
larger PAAs with hundreds of elements by increasing the number of comb lines
with broadband microcomb generation.

optical domain with applications in data communication for optical
interconnects, but also for novel optical compute algorithms such as providing
nonlinearity at the output stage of optical perceptrons in neuromorphic
analogue optical computing. Since the clock frequency for photonics on chip has
a power overhead sweet slot around 10s of GHz, ultrafast modulation may only be
required in long distance communication, but not for short onchip links. Here
we show a roadmap towards atto Joule per bit efficient modulators on chip as
well as some experimental demonstrations of novel plasmon modulators with sub
1fJ per bit efficiencies. We then discuss the first experimental demonstration
of a photon plasmon-hybrid Graphene-based electroabsorption modulator on
silicon. The device shows a sub 1V steep switching enabled by near ideal
electrostatics delivering a high 0.05dB per V um performance requiring only 110
aJ per bit. Improving on this design, we discuss a plasmonic slot based
Graphene modulator design, where the polarization of the plasmonic mode matches
with Graphenes inplane dimension. Here a push pull dual gating scheme enables
2dB per V um efficient modulation allowing the device to be just 770 nm short
for 3dB small signal modulation. This in turn allows for a device-enabled two
orders of magnitude improvement of electrical optical co integrated network on
chips over electronic only architectures. The latter opens technological
opportunities in in cognitive computing, dynamic data-driven applications
system, and optical analogue compute engines to include neuromorphic photonic
computing.

sample was inserted in one of the two beams, and the corresponding image was
integrated over the camera extent to synthesize a bucket signal. We show the
successful x-ray ghost image reconstruction of two samples and discuss
different reconstruction strategies. We also demonstrate a method for measuring
the point spread function of a ghost imaging system, which can be used to

To get the most from low cost sensor with aforementioned design in mind, we
proposed data processing modules for capturing public space utilization with
Renewable Wireless Sensor Network (RWSN) platform using pyroelectric infrared
(PIR) and analog sound sensor. We first proposed a calibration process to
remove false alarm of PIR sensor due to the impact of weather and environment.
We then demonstrate how the sounds sensor can be processed to provide various

independent and highly decoupled processes. Recently, microservices are often
mentioned in one breath with container technologies like Docker. That is why
operating system virtualization experiences a renaissance in cloud computing.
These approaches shall provide horizontally scalable, easily deployable systems
and a high-performance alternative to hypervisors. Nevertheless, performance
impacts of containers on top of hypervisors are hardly investigated.
Furthermore, microservice frameworks often come along with software defined
networks. This contribution presents benchmark results to quantify the impacts
of container, software defined networking and encryption on network
performance. Even containers, although postulated to be lightweight, show a
noteworthy impact to network performance. These impacts can be minimized on
several system layers. Some design recommendations for cloud deployed systems
following the microservice architecture pattern are derived.
