shown that the projections do not depend on $\rho$. We explicit their quantile

Martingale Optimal Transport problems by using linear programming solvers. We
prove convergence of the Wasserstein projection based sampling methods as the

  neural networks","Generalized some estimates to $L^p$ norms for $0<p<\infty$",,,,"math.FA cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the necessary and sufficient complexity of ReLU neural networks---in
terms of depth and number of weights---which is required for approximating
classifier functions in $L^2$. As a model class, we consider the set
$\mathcal{E}^\beta (\mathbb R^d)$ of possibly discontinuous piecewise $C^\beta$
functions $f : [-1/2, 1/2]^d \to \mathbb R$, where the different smooth regions
of $f$ are separated by $C^\beta$ hypersurfaces. For dimension $d \geq 2$,
regularity $\beta > 0$, and accuracy $\varepsilon > 0$, we construct artificial
neural networks with ReLU activation function that approximate functions from
$\mathcal{E}^\beta(\mathbb R^d)$ up to $L^2$ error of $\varepsilon$. The
constructed networks have a fixed number of layers, depending only on $d$ and
$\beta$, and they have $O(\varepsilon^{-2(d-1)/\beta})$ many nonzero weights,
which we prove to be optimal. In addition to the optimality in terms of the
number of weights, we show that in order to achieve the optimal approximation
rate, one needs ReLU networks of a certain depth. Precisely, for piecewise
$C^\beta(\mathbb R^d)$ functions, this minimal depth is given---up to a
multiplicative constant---by $\beta/d$. Up to a log factor, our constructed
networks match this bound. This partly explains the benefits of depth for ReLU
networks by showing that deep networks are necessary to achieve efficient
approximation of (piecewise) smooth functions. Finally, we analyze
approximation in high-dimensional spaces where the function $f$ to be
approximated can be factorized into a smooth dimension reducing feature map
$\tau$ and classifier function $g$---defined on a low-dimensional feature
space---as $f = g \circ \tau$. We show that in this case the approximation rate
depends only on the dimension of the feature space and not the input dimension.

derived from first principles, using a Zwanzig-Caldeira-Leggett system-bath

response to mechanical deformation. This approach provides a
Generalized-Langevin-Equation (GLE) as the average equation of motion for an
atom or ion in the material, from which non-Markovian nonaffine viscoelastic
moduli are extracted. These can be evaluated using the vibrational density of
states (DOS) as input, where the boson peak plays a prominent role for the
mechanics. To compare with experimental data of binary ZrCu alloys, numerical
DOS was obtained from simulations of this system, which take also electronic
degrees of freedom into account via the embedded atom method (EAM) for the
interatomic potential. It is shown that the viscoelastic $\alpha$-relaxation,
including the $\alpha$-wing asymmetry in the loss modulus, can be very well
described by the theory if the memory kernel (the non-Markovian friction) in
the GLE is taken to be a stretched-exponential decaying function of time. This
finding directly implies strong memory effects in the atomic-scale dynamics,
and suggests that the $\alpha$-relaxation time is related to the characteristic
time-scale over which atoms retain memory of their previous collision history.
This memory time grows dramatically below the glass transition.

orthogonal pair of vectors among $n$ Boolean vectors in $d$ dimensions. The OV
Conjecture (OVC) posits that OV requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to solve, for all
$d=\omega(\log n)$. Assuming the OVC, optimal time lower bounds have been
proved for many prominent problems in $P$.
  We prove that OVC is true in several computational models of interest:
  * For all sufficiently large $n$ and $d$, OV for $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^d$
has branching program complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(n\cdot \min(n,2^d))$. In
particular, the lower bounds match the upper bounds up to polylog factors.
  * OV has Boolean formula complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(n\cdot \min(n,2^d))$,
over all complete bases of $O(1)$ fan-in.
  * OV requires $\tilde{\Theta}(n\cdot \min(n,2^d))$ wires, in formulas
comprised of gates computing arbitrary symmetric functions of unbounded fan-in.
  Our lower bounds basically match the best known (quadratic) lower bounds for
any explicit function in those models. Analogous lower bounds hold for many
related problems shown to be hard under OVC, such as Batch Partial Match, Batch
Subset Queries, and Batch Hamming Nearest Neighbors, all of which have very
succinct reductions to OV.
  The proofs use a certain kind of input restriction that is different from
typical random restrictions where variables are assigned independently. We give
a sense in which independent random restrictions cannot be used to show
hardness, in that OVC is false in the ""average case"" even for $AC^0$ formulas:
  * For every fixed $p \in (0,1)$ there is an $\epsilon_p > 0$ such that for
every $n$ and $d$, OV instances where input bits are independently set to $1$
with probability $p$ (and $0$ otherwise) can be solved with $AC^0$ formulas of
size $O(n^{2-\epsilon_p})$, on all but a $o_n(1)$ fraction of instances.

photon-loss or photon-gain errors by means of photon-number parity measurements
and then correct them via $\chi^{(2)}$ Hamiltonian evolutions and linear-optics
transformations. Our symmetry-operator framework provides a systematic
procedure for finding QEC codes that are not stabilizer codes. The $\chi^{(2)}$
binomial code is of special interest because, with $m\le N$ identified from
channel monitoring, it can correct $m$-photon loss errors, $m$-photon gain
errors, and $(m-1)$th-order dephasing errors using logical qudits that are
encoded in $O(N)$ photons. In comparison, other bosonic QEC codes require
$O(N^2)$ photons to correct the same degree of bosonic errors. Such improved
photon-efficiency underscores the additional error-correction power that can be
provided by channel monitoring. We develop quantum Hamming bounds for
photon-loss errors in the code subspaces associated with the $\chi^{(2)}$
parity-check code and the $\chi^{(2)}$ embedded error-correcting code, and we
prove that these codes saturate their respective bounds. Our $\chi^{(2)}$ QEC

visual data for processing. However, retrieval of important activities from
such a large data can be time consuming. Thus, researchers are working on
finding solutions to present hours of visual data in a compressed, but
meaningful way. Video synopsis is one of the ways to represent activities using
relatively shorter duration clips. So far, two main approaches have been used
by researchers to address this problem, namely synopsis by tracking moving
objects and synopsis by clustering moving objects. Synopses outputs, mainly
depend on tracking, segmenting, and shifting of moving objects temporally as
well as spatially. In many situations, tracking fails, thus produces multiple
trajectories of the same object. Due to this, the object may appear and
disappear multiple times within the same synopsis output, which is misleading.
This also leads to discontinuity and often can be confusing to the viewer of
the synopsis. In this paper, we present a new approach for generating
compressed video synopsis by grouping tracklets of moving objects. Grouping
helps to generate a synopsis where chronologically related objects appear
together with meaningful spatio-temporal relation. Our proposed method produces
continuous, but a less confusing synopses when tested on publicly available

\emph{string attractor}: a subset of the string's positions $[1,n]$ such that
every distinct substring of $S$ has an occurrence crossing one of the
attractor's elements. We first show that the minimum attractor's size yields
upper-bounds to the string's repetitiveness as measured by its linguistic
complexity and by the length of its longest repeated substring. We then prove
that all known compressors for repetitive strings induce a string attractor
whose size is bounded by their associated repetitiveness measure, and can
therefore be considered as approximations of the smallest one. Using further
reductions, we derive the approximation ratios of these compressors with
respect to the smallest attractor and solve several open problems related to
the asymptotic relations between repetitiveness measures (in particular,
between the the sizes of the Lempel-Ziv factorization, the run-length
Burrows-Wheeler transform, the smallest grammar, and the smallest macro
scheme). These reductions directly provide approximation algorithms for the
smallest string attractor. We then apply string attractors to solve efficiently
a fundamental problem in the field of compressed computation: we present a
universal compressed data structure for text extraction that improves existing
strategies simultaneously for \emph{all} known dictionary compressors and that,
by recent lower bounds, almost matches the optimal running time within the

scale the computational cost of the approach to linear complexity in the number

is to identify the best causal hypothesis out of $X\rightarrow Y$ and
$Y\rightarrow X$. Secondly, CGNN is applied to the problem of identifying
v-structures and conditional independences. Thirdly, CGNN is applied to
multivariate functional causal modeling: given a skeleton describing the direct

CGNN orients the edges in the skeleton to uncover the directed acyclic causal

the oscillatory models can introduce some degeneracy with late time effects on

favored by Planck data do not have significant effect on the non linear
structure formation. Finally we show that inflationary models with step
functions which deviates from the standard model in small scales $l \leq 1 Mpc$
can be constrained by future experiments via CMB lensing. We propose the idea
that CMB lensing is a bias independent observation which can be used as a small

Meantime this model can alter the prediction of the cosmological model for the

then segments CME regions using the trained model. Thereafter, dense CRFs are
used to refine the segmentation according to the edema appearance. We have
trained and tested the framework with OCT images from 10 patients with diabetic

data from sophisticated experimental studies. In this paper, we present Granger
Mediation Analysis (GMA), a new framework for causal mediation analysis of
multiple time series. This framework is motivated by a functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment where we are interested in estimating the
mediation effects between a randomized stimulus time series and brain activity
time series from two brain regions. The stable unit treatment assumption for
causal mediation analysis is thus unrealistic for this type of time series
data. To address this challenge, our framework integrates two types of models:
causal mediation analysis across the variables and vector autoregressive models
across the temporal observations. We further extend this framework to handle
multilevel data to address individual variability and correlated errors between
the mediator and the outcome variables. These models not only provide valid
causal mediation for time series data but also model the causal dynamics across
time. We show that the modeling parameters in our models are identifiable, and
we develop computationally efficient methods to maximize the likelihood-based
optimization criteria. Simulation studies show that our method reduces the
estimation bias and improve statistical power, compared to existing approaches.
On a real fMRI data set, our approach not only infers the causal effects of
brain pathways but accurately captures the feedback effect of the outcome
region on the mediator region.

originate from hadronic interactions of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei with the
interstellar medium. To understand the emission, we have used the moving mesh
code Arepo to perform magneto-hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations with
self-consistent CR physics. Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star
formation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufficiently
accumulated in our Milky-Way like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the
magnetic tension of the toroidal disk field. As field lines open up, they
enable anisotropically diffusing CRs to escape into the halo and to accelerate
a bubble-like, CR-dominated outflow. However, these bubbles are invisible in
our simulated gamma-ray maps of hadronic pion-decay and secondary
inverse-Compton emission because of low gas density in the outflows. By
adopting a phenomenological relation between star formation rate (SFR) and
far-infrared emission and assuming that gamma rays mainly originate from
decaying pions, our simulated galaxies can reproduce the observed tight
relation between far-infrared and gamma-ray emission, independent of whether we
account for anisotropic CR diffusion. This demonstrates that uncertainties in
modeling active CR transport processes only play a minor role in predicting
gamma-ray emission from galaxies. We find that in starbursts, most of the CR
energy is ""calorimetrically"" lost to hadronic interactions. In contrast, the
gamma-ray emission deviates from this calorimetric property at low SFRs due to
adiabatic losses, which cannot be identified in traditional one-zone models.

($\approx 0.01$ pc projected) at a distance of $r\approx 100$ pc with nearly
identical three-dimensional velocities, as inferred from Gaia TGAS parallaxes
and proper motions, and high-precision radial velocity measurements. Stellar
parameters determined from high-resolution Keck HIRES spectra indicate that
both stars are $\sim 4$ Gyr old. The more metal-rich of the two, HD 240430,
shows an enhancement of refractory ($T_C>1200$ K) elements by $\approx 0.2$ dex
and a marginal enhancement of (moderately) volatile elements ($T_C<1200$ K, C,
N, O, Na, and Mn). This is the largest metallicity difference found in a wide
binary pair yet. Additionally, HD 240430 shows an anomalously high surface
lithium abundance ($A(\mathrm{Li})=2.75$), higher than its companion by $0.5$
dex. The proximity in phase-space and ages between the two stars suggests that
they formed together with the same composition, at odds with the observed
differences in metallicity and abundance patterns. We therefore suggest that
the star HD~240430, ""Kronos"", accreted 15 $M_\oplus$ of rocky material after
birth, selectively enhancing the refractory elements as well as lithium in its
surface and convective envelope.

determining their mass is key to understand how the population evolves over

universe, the mass is commonly estimated assuming virialized motion of gas in
the close vicinity to the active black holes, traced through broad emission
lines. However, this procedure has uncertainties associated with the unknown
distribution of the gas clouds. Here we show that the comparison of black hole
masses derived from the properties of the central accretion disc with the
virial mass estimate provides a correcting factor, for the virial mass
estimations, that is inversely proportional to the observed width of the broad
emission lines. Our results suggest that line-of-sight inclination of gas in a
planar distribution can account for this effect. However, radiation pressure
effects on the distribution of gas can also reproduce our findings. Regardless
of the physical origin, our findings contribute to mitigate the uncertainties
in current black hole mass estimations and, in turn, will help to further
understand the evolution of distant supermassive black holes and their host

resonant absorption onto a gas of small polyatomic molecules. Bosonic DM acts
on the molecules as a narrow-band perturbation, like an intense but weakly
coupled laser. The excited molecules emit the absorbed energy into fluorescence
photons that are picked up by sensitive photodetectors with low dark count
rates. This setup is sensitive to any DM candidate that couples to electrons,
photons, and nuclei, and may improve on current searches by several orders of
magnitude in coupling for DM masses between 0.2 eV and 20 eV. This type of
detector has excellent intrinsic energy resolution, along with several control
variables---pressure, temperature, external electromagnetic fields, molecular
species/isotopes---that allow for powerful background rejection methods as well
as precision studies of a potential DM signal. The proposed experiment does not
require usage of novel exotic materials or futuristic technologies, relying
instead on the well-established field of molecular spectroscopy, and on recent
advances in single-photon detection. Cooperative radiation effects, which arise
due to the large spatial coherence of the nonrelativistic DM field in certain
detector geometries, can tightly focus the DM-induced fluorescence photons in a
direction that depends on the DM's velocity, possibly permitting a detailed
reconstruction of the full 3D velocity distribution in our Galactic
neighborhood, as well as further background rejection.

fraction of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch
of Reionization (EoR, z~6-10) from detections and non-detections of Lyman Alpha
(Ly$\alpha$) emission from Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Our framework combines
sophisticated reionization simulations with empirical models of the
interstellar medium (ISM) radiative transfer effects on Ly$\alpha$. We assert
that the Ly$\alpha$ line profile emerging from the ISM has an important impact
on the resulting transmission of photons through the IGM, and that these line
profiles depend on galaxy properties. We model this effect by considering the
peak velocity offset of Ly$\alpha$ lines from host galaxies' systemic
redshifts, which are empirically correlated with UV luminosity and redshift (or
halo mass at fixed redshift). We use our framework on the sample of LBGs
presented in Pentericci et al. (2014) and infer a global neutral fraction at
z~7 of $\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI} = 0.59_{-0.15}^{+0.11}$, consistent with other
robust probes of the EoR and confirming reionization is on-going ~700 Myr after
the Big Bang. We show that using the full distribution of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent
width detections and upper limits from LBGs places tighter constraints on the

uncertain. In our analysis we use iron K-edge synchrotron data of minerals

the size of astrophysical dust in the Galactic centre and in molecular clouds
with future X-ray missions. The energy resolution and the effective area of the
present X-ray telescopes are not sufficient to detect and study the Fe K-edge,
even for bright X-ray sources. From the analysis of the extinction cross
sections of our dust models implemented in the spectral fitting program SPEX,
the Fe K-edge is promising for investigating both the chemistry and the size
distribution of the interstellar dust. We find that the chemical composition
regulates the X-ray absorption fine structures in the post edge region, whereas
the scattering feature in the pre-edge is sensitive to the mean grain size.
Finally, we note that the Fe K-edge is insensitive to other dust properties,
such as the porosity and the geometry of the dust.

algorithms based on hidden Markov models (HMM), lead to higher-quality enhanced
speech signals. However, the main practical difficulty of these approaches is
that for each noise type a model is required to be trained a priori. In this
paper, we investigate a new class of supervised speech denoising algorithms
using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We propose a novel speech
enhancement method that is based on a Bayesian formulation of NMF (BNMF). To
circumvent the mismatch problem between the training and testing stages, we
propose two solutions. First, we use an HMM in combination with BNMF (BNMF-HMM)
to derive a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for the speech signal
with no information about the underlying noise type. Second, we suggest a
scheme to learn the required noise BNMF model online, which is then used to
develop an unsupervised speech enhancement system. Extensive experiments are
carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed methods under
different conditions. Moreover, we compare the performance of the developed
algorithms with state-of-the-art speech enhancement schemes using various
objective measures. Our simulations show that the proposed BNMF-based methods

technologies that require processing and correlating distributed data sources

a large number of proposals for expressing and processing complex events.
However, existing CEP languages lack from a clear semantics, making them hard
to understand and generalize. Moreover, there are no general techniques for
evaluating CEP query languages with clear performance guarantees.
  In this paper we embark on the task of giving a rigorous and efficient
framework to CEP. We propose a formal language for specifying complex events,
called CEL, that contains the main features used in the literature and has a
denotational and compositional semantics. We also formalize the so-called
selection strategies, which had only been presented as by-design extensions to
existing frameworks. With a well-defined semantics at hand, we study how to
efficiently evaluate CEL for processing complex events in the case of unary
filters. We start by studying the syntactical properties of CEL and propose
rewriting optimization techniques for simplifying the evaluation of formulas.
Then, we introduce a formal computational model for CEP, called complex event
automata (CEA), and study how to compile CEL formulas into CEA. Furthermore, we
provide efficient algorithms for evaluating CEA over event streams using
constant time per event followed by constant-delay enumeration of the results.
By gathering these results together, we propose a framework for efficiently
evaluating CEL with unary filters. Finally, we show experimentally that this
framework consistently outperforms the competition, and even over trivial
queries can be orders of magnitude more efficient.

with applications to partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow
imaging.
  Theory and Methods: The problem of enforcing phase constraints in
reconstruction was studied under a regularized inverse problem framework. A
general phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable
various joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and
flow imaging, along with parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS).
Since phase regularized reconstruction is inherently non-convex and sensitive
to phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique, named phase
cycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps.
The proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo
datasets and compared with state of the art reconstruction methods.
  Results: Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction of artifacts compared
to reconstructions with- out phase cycling and achieved similar performances as
state of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free
regularized flow reconstruction. Joint reconstruction of partial Fourier +
water-fat imaging + PI + CS, and partial Fourier + divergence-free regularized
flow imaging + PI + CS were demonstrated.
  Conclusion: The proposed phase cycling reconstruction provides an alternative
way to perform phase regularized reconstruction, without the need to perform
phase unwrapping. It is robust to the choice of initial solutions and
encourages the joint reconstruction of phase imaging applications.

network, which effectively alleviates the backhaul burden and reduces
round-trip latency. To fully exploit the edge resources, the most popular
contents should be identified and cached. Observing that content popularity
varies greatly at different locations, to maximize local hit rate, this paper
proposes an online learning algorithm that dynamically predicts content hit
rate, and makes location-differentiated caching decisions. Specifically, a
linear model is used to estimate the future hit rate. Considering the
variations in user demand, a perturbation is added to the estimation to account
for uncertainty. The proposed learning algorithm requires no training phase,
and hence is adaptive to the time-varying content popularity profile.
Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm asymptotically
approaches the optimal policy in the long term. Extensive simulations based on
real world traces show that, the proposed algorithm achieves higher hit rate
and better adaptiveness to content popularity fluctuation, compared with other
schemes.

identifying key issues in each project, and constructing chronological

emergent themes with respect to five dimensions of project ownership: student
agency, instructor mentorship, peer collaboration, interest and value, and
affective responses. Our within- and cross-case analyses yielded three major
findings. First, coupling division of labor with collective brainstorming can
help balance student agency, instructor mentorship, and peer collaboration.
Second, students' interest in the project and perceptions of its value can
increase over time; initial student interest in the project topic is not a
necessary condition for student ownership of the project. Third, student
ownership is characterized by a wide range of emotions that fluctuate as
students alternate between extended periods of struggle and moments of success
while working on their projects. These findings not only extend the literature
on student ownership into a new educational domain---namely, upper-division
physics labs---they also have concrete implications for the design of
experimental physics projects in courses for which student ownership is a
desired learning outcome. We describe the course and projects in sufficient
detail that others can adapt our results to their particular contexts.

For exploitation, it is well known that the Bellman equation connects the value

connects the uncertainty at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at

traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard deviation rather than

formed by temporarily activating clusters of nearby trusted mobile devices,
with each cluster being centrally coordinated by its corresponding cluster
head. We assume that the transmitters apply a practical eigen-direction
precoding scheme to transmit the confidential signal and artificial noise,
while the eavesdropper can be located in multiple possible locations in the
proximity. We first obtain the expression of the secrecy rate, where the
required average mutual information between the transmitters and the
eavesdropper is characterized by closed-form approximations. The proposed
approximations are especially useful in the secrecy rate maximization, where
the original non-convex problem can be solved by the successive convex
approximations. Numerical results show that the secrecy rate can be
significantly improved by leveraging the location constraint of the
eavesdropper, compared to the existing result. We also demonstrate that the
secrecy rate can be further improved by increasing the cluster size.

series connection is commutative so that it is independent from the sequence of
subsystems in the connection. Hence, the convenient sequence can be decided by
considering the overall performance of the system when the sensitivity,
disturbance and robustness effects are considered. Realization covers transient
responses as well as steady state responses.

We define the weight of $D$ to be the number of reachable pairs of $D$, which
equals the sum of the number of vertices in $D$ and the number of directed
edges in the transitive closure of $D$. In this paper, we study the set $W(n)$
of possible weights of directed graphs on $n$ labeled vertices. We prove that
$W(n)$ can be determined recursively and describe the integers in the set.
Moreover, if $b(n) \geqslant n$ is the least integer for which there is no
digraph on $n$ vertices with exactly $b(n)+1$ reachable pairs, we determine
$b(n)$ exactly through a simple recursive formula and find an explicit function
$g(n)$ such that $|b(n)-g(n)| < 2n$ for all $n \geqslant 3$. Using these

understanding of international trade. First, countries trade more with those
with whom they share history, language, and culture, suggesting that trade is
limited by information frictions. Second, countries are more likely to start
exporting products that are similar to their current exports, suggesting that
knowledge diffusion among related industries is a key constrain shaping the
diversification of exports. But does knowledge about how to export to a
destination also diffuses among related products and geographic neighbors? Do
countries need to learn how to trade each product to each destination? Here, we
use bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2015 to show that countries are more
likely to increase their exports of a product to a destination when: (i) they
export related products to it, (ii) they export the same product to the
neighbor of a destination, (iii) they have neighbors who export the same
product to that destination. Then, we explore the magnitude of these effects
for new, nascent, and experienced exporters, (exporters with and without
comparative advantage in a product) and also for groups of products with
different level of technological sophistication. We find that the effects of
product and geographic relatedness are stronger for new exporters, and also,
that the effect of product relatedness is stronger for more technologically
sophisticated products. These findings support the idea that international
trade is shaped by information frictions that are reduced in the presence of
related products and experienced geographic neighbors.

individually, rather than in aggregate, when performing parent selection.
Whereas previous work has demonstrated the ability of lexicase selection to
solve difficult problems in program synthesis and symbolic regression, the
central goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical underpinnings that
explain its performance. To this end, we derive an analytical formula that
gives the expected probabilities of selection under lexicase selection, given a
population and its behavior. In addition, we expand upon the relation of
lexicase selection to many-objective optimization methods to describe the
behavior of lexicase selection, which is to select individuals on the
boundaries of Pareto fronts in high-dimensional space. We show analytically why
lexicase selection performs more poorly for certain sizes of population and
training cases, and show why it has been shown to perform more poorly in
continuous error spaces. To address this last concern, we propose new variants
of epsilon-lexicase selection, a method that modifies the pass condition in
lexicase selection to allow near-elite individuals to pass cases, thereby
improving selection performance with continuous errors. We show that
epsilon-lexicase outperforms several diversity-maintenance strategies on a
number of real-world and synthetic regression problems.

histogram of a categorical dataset over a possibly large data universe
$\mathcal{X}$. The classic Laplace Mechanism (Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, Smith,

requirements, as it is based on real arithmetic, and natural discrete
analogues, such as the Geometric Mechanism (Ghosh, Roughgarden, Sundarajan,
STOC 2009 and SICOMP 2012), take time at least linear in $|\mathcal{X}|$, which
can be exponential in the bit length of the input.
  In this paper, we provide strict polynomial-time discrete algorithms for
approximate histograms whose simultaneous accuracy (the maximum error over all

retaining the same (pure) differential privacy guarantee. One of our algorithms
produces a sparse histogram as output. Its ""per-bin accuracy"" (the error on
individual bins) is worse than that of the Laplace Mechanism by a factor of
$\log|\mathcal{X}|$, but we prove a lower bound showing that this is necessary
for any algorithm that produces a sparse histogram. A second algorithm avoids
this lower bound, and matches the per-bin accuracy of the Laplace Mechanism, by
producing a compact and efficiently computable representation of a dense

learning, the task of change detection on a large-scale map from a visual image
captured by a mobile robot has become a problem of increasing criticality.
Previous approaches for change detection are typically based on image
differencing and require the memorization of a prohibitively large number of
mapped images in the above context. In contrast, this study follows the recent,
efficient paradigm of change-classifier-learning and specifically employs a
collection of place-specific change classifiers. Our change-classifier-learning
algorithm is based on zero-shot learning (ZSL) and represents a place-specific
change classifier by its training examples mined from an external knowledge
base (EKB). The proposed algorithm exhibits several advantages. First, we are
required to memorize only training examples (rather than the classifier
itself), which can be further compressed in the form of bag-of-words (BoW).
Secondly, we can incorporate the most recent map into the classifiers by
straightforwardly adding or deleting a few training examples that correspond to
these classifiers. Thirdly, we can share the BoW vocabulary with other related
task scenarios (e.g., BoW-based self-localization), wherein the vocabulary is
generally designed as a rich, continuously growing, and domain-adaptive
knowledge base. In our contribution, the proposed algorithm is applied and
evaluated on a practical long-term cross-season change detection system that
consists of a large number of place-specific object-level change classifiers.

higher control torque around the vehicle's upward axis. A geometric controller
on SE(3) is proposed for the trajectory tracking problem for the class of fully

produce a turn, but in other cases, the only content available comes from
search, and it may be unclear which semantic relations hold between the search
results and the discourse context. A further constraint is that the system must
produce its contribution to the ongoing conversation in real-time. This paper

  Acquisition",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lifelong machine learning methods acquire knowledge over a series of
consecutive tasks, continually building upon their experience. Current lifelong
learning algorithms rely upon a single learning agent that has centralized
access to all data. In this paper, we extend the idea of lifelong learning from
a single agent to a network of multiple agents that collectively learn a series
of tasks. Each agent faces some (potentially unique) set of tasks; the key idea
is that knowledge learned from these tasks may benefit other agents trying to
learn different (but related) tasks. Our Collective Lifelong Learning Algorithm
(CoLLA) provides an efficient way for a network of agents to share their
learned knowledge in a distributed and decentralized manner, while preserving
the privacy of the locally observed data. Note that a decentralized scheme is a
subclass of distributed algorithms where a central server does not exist and in
addition to data, computations are also distributed among the agents. We
provide theoretical guarantees for robust performance of the algorithm and
empirically demonstrate that CoLLA outperforms existing approaches for
distributed multi-task learning on a variety of data sets.

a data-driven approach to predict important conversation outcomes: customer

significant effect on the probability of desirable and undesirable outcomes,

intricacies of Lorenz-Mie scattering and the high albedo of cloud-forming
aerosols make rendering of clouds---e.g. the characteristic silverlining and
the ""whiteness"" of the inner body---challenging for methods based solely on
Monte Carlo integration or diffusion theory. We approach the problem
differently. Instead of simulating all light transport during rendering, we
pre-learn the spatial and directional distribution of radiant flux from tens of
cloud exemplars. To render a new scene, we sample visible points of the cloud
and, for each, extract a hierarchical 3D descriptor of the cloud geometry with
respect to the shading location and the light source. The descriptor is input
to a deep neural network that predicts the radiance function for each shading
configuration. We make the key observation that progressively feeding the
hierarchical descriptor into the network enhances the network's ability to
learn faster and predict with high accuracy while using few coefficients. We
also employ a block design with residual connections to further improve
performance. A GPU implementation of our method synthesizes images of clouds
that are nearly indistinguishable from the reference solution within seconds
interactively. Our method thus represents a viable solution for applications

a transmon, which is driven by an RF pump to apply the gate within 190 ns. This
is two orders of magnitude shorter than the decoherence time of the transmon,
enabling a high-fidelity gate operation. These results are an important step

onto compact objects, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can differ
significantly from the standard (collisional) MRI. In particular, pressure
anisotropy with respect to the local magnetic-field direction can both change
the linear MRI dispersion relation and cause nonlinear modifications to the
mode structure and growth rate, even when the field and flow perturbations are
small. This work studies these pressure-anisotropy-induced nonlinearities in
the weakly nonlinear, high-ion-beta regime, before the MRI saturates into
strong turbulence. Our goal is to better understand how the saturation of the
MRI in a low collisionality plasma might differ from that in the collisional
regime. We focus on two key effects: (i) the direct impact of self-induced
pressure-anisotropy nonlinearities on the evolution of an MRI mode, and (ii)
the influence of pressure anisotropy on the ""parasitic instabilities"" that are
suspected to cause the mode to break up into turbulence. Our main conclusions
are: (i) The mirror instability regulates the pressure anisotropy in such a way
that the linear MRI in a collisionless plasma is an approximate nonlinear
solution once the mode amplitude becomes larger than the background field (just
as in MHD). This implies that differences between the collisionless and
collisional MRI become unimportant at large amplitudes. (ii) The break up of
large amplitude MRI modes into turbulence via parasitic instabilities is
similar in collisionless and collisional plasmas. Together, these conclusions
suggest that the route to magnetorotational turbulence in a collisionless
plasma may well be similar to that in a collisional plasma, as suggested by
recent kinetic simulations. As a supplement to these findings, we offer
guidance for the design of future kinetic simulations of magnetorotational
turbulence.

connected to its potential dynamics, thus affording an avenue for moving
systems in the information-theoretic space and controlling them in the phase
space. To this end we performed experiments and validated the results on (1) a
very large set of small graphs, (2) a number of larger networks with different
topologies, and (3) biological networks from a widely studied and validated
genetic network (e.coli) as well as on a significant number of differentiating
(Th17) and differentiated human cells from high quality databases (Harvard's
CellNet) with results conforming to experimentally validated biological data.
Based on these results we introduce a conceptual framework, a model-based
interventional calculus and a reprogrammability measure with which to steer,
manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics of non- linear dynamical systems from
partial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and
applying a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate
how its algorithmic information content is affected when every one of its
elements are perturbed. The approach represents an alternative to numerical
simulation and statistical approaches for inferring causal
mechanistic/generative models and finding first principles. We demonstrate the
framework's capabilities by reconstructing the phase space of some discrete
dynamical systems (cellular automata) as case study and reconstructing their
generating rules. We thus advance tools for reprogramming artificial and living
systems without full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic
equations or probability distributions yielding a suite of universal and

quantum computation and important in the field of quantum information
processing. It is therefore of interest both for theoretical considerations and
for experimental implementation to find new types and instances of contextual
sets and develop methods of their optimal generation. We present an arbitrary
exhaustive hypergraph-based generation of the most explored contextual
sets---Kochen-Specker (KS) ones---in 4, 6, 8, 16, and 32 dimensions. We
consider and analyse twelve KS classes and obtain numerous properties of
theirs, which we then compare with the results previously obtained in the
literature. We generate several thousand times more types and instances of KS
sets than previously known. All KS sets in three of the classes and in the
upper part of a fourth are novel. We make use of the MMP hypergraph language,
algorithms, and programs to generate KS sets strictly following their
definition from the Kochen-Specker theorem. This approach proves to be
particularly advantageous over the parity-proof-based ones (which prevail in
the literature), since it turns out that only a very few KS sets have a parity
proof (in six KS classes 0.01% and in one of them 0%). MMP hypergraph formalism
enables a translation of an exponentially complex task of solving systems of
nonlinearequations, describing KS vector orthogonalities, into a statistically
linearly complex task of evaluating vertex states of hypergraph edges, thus
exponentially speeding up the generation of KS sets and enabling us to generate
billions of novel instances of them. The MMP hypergraph notation also enables
us to graphically represent KS sets and to visually discern their features.

which a neutral atom undergoes a change of momentum through an interaction with
a coherent light source. When the Bragg conditions are met, the outgoing atom
beams are spatially quantized. Counterpropagating lasers act as pump and probe
scattering from far-off-resonant excited intermediate electronic states,
leaving the atoms in the electronic ground state with quantized transverse
momentum. Each nontrivial scattering event imparts transverse velocity and
therefore kinetic energy to the deflected atoms through recoil. In the Bragg
regime, the loss of energy in the light fields is equal to the gain of kinetic
energy in the atom. Energy nonconserving intermediate states, which are
described by nonadiabatic contributions, are not accounted for by first-order
off-resonant states. By comparing the solutions of increasing orders of
off-resonant intermediate states, it becomes clear that calculating the correct
Pendell\""{o}sung frequencies and phases requires including an ever increasing
number of off-resonant states in proportion to the square root of the field

are morphologically early-type or early-spirals. For a given morphology AGN
hosts are, in average, more massive, more compact, more central peaked and
rather pressurethan rotational-supported systems. We confirm previous results
indicating that AGN hosts are located in the intermediate/transition region
between star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies (i.e., the so-called green

halting/quenching the star formation, in an actual transition between both
groups. The analysis of the radial distributions of the starformation rate,

negative data indicating that a robot should not go through a space is
typically hard and dangerous because of collisions, whereas collecting positive
data can be automated and done safely based on the robot's own traveling
experience. We verify the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach

planning and it becomes more difficult when the desired path contains narrow
passages. This kind of scenario can arise, for instance, when quadcopters
search a collapsed building after a natural disaster. Choosing the quadcopter
as the target platform, this paper proposes the Kinodynamic Aggressive
Trajectory (KAT) motion planning algorithm, which aims to compute aggressive
trajectories for narrow passages under nonholonomic constraints. This type of
maneuvers is necessary because the dynamics of quadcopters entail that some
narrow passages can only be traversed at high speed.
  To find the best path, the KAT uses RRT to determine a holonomic path first
and then adjusts it to satisfy the nonholonomic constraints. The innovations in
this process are: 1) The states of the robot are divided into near-holonomic
set and non-holonomic set, which makes the constraints local rather than
global; 2) For each of the most confined waypoints in the path, KAT plans
forward and backward simultaneously around the waypoint to find a feasible
local trajectory traversing the narrow passage. Our approach thus transforms a
globally-constrained planning problem into a problem with local constraints,
and as a result, the computation becomes tractable. We evaluate KAT by applying
it to a quadcopter flying through two inclined holes that require aggressive
maneuvers in a simulated environment. The average computation time to
successfully find a solution for passing two 50 degree inclined holes is around
32 seconds.

implicit representation of the state space, which is enabled by a set of
probing samples. Traditionally, these samples are drawn either
probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet,
the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to ""small"" regions of
the state space, due to, for example, differential constraints or
collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus
desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in
those regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a
methodology for non-uniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is
learned from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling
distribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder,
allowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific
planning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with
any sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying
structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of
sampling-based approaches. Specifically, on several planning problems, the
proposed methodology is shown to effectively learn representations for the
relevant regions of the state space, resulting in an order of magnitude
improvement in terms of success rate and convergence to the optimal cost.

owing to their motility that impacts their large-scale collective behavior. For

shown that the virial `swim stress' is a useful quantity to understand the
rheology and nonequilibrium behaviors of active soft matter systems. For larger
self-propelled organisms like fish, it is unclear how particle inertia impacts
their stress generation and collective movement. Here, we analyze the effects
of finite particle inertia on the mechanical pressure (or stress) generated by
a suspension of self-propelled bodies. We find that swimmers of all scales
generate a unique `swim stress' and `Reynolds stress' that impacts their
collective motion. We discover that particle inertia plays a similar role as
confinement in overdamped active Brownian systems, where the reduced run length
of the swimmers decreases the swim stress and affects the phase behavior.
Although the swim and Reynolds stresses vary individually with the magnitude of
particle inertia, the sum of the two contributions is independent of particle
inertia. This points to an important concept when computing stresses in
computer simulations of nonequilibrium systems---the Reynolds and the virial
stresses must both be calculated to obtain the overall stress generated by a

generalization and specialization abilities, we employ an ensemble of
convolutional neural network (DCN) classifiers and consider the task of
scheduling (when and which classifiers to retrain), given a previous season's
DCN classifiers as the sole prior knowledge. We present a unified framework for
retraining scheduling and discuss practical implementation strategies.
Furthermore, we address the task of partitioning a robot's workspace into
places to define place classes in an unsupervised manner, rather than using
uniform partitioning, so as to maximize VPC performance. Experiments using the
publicly available NCLT dataset revealed that retraining scheduling of a DCN
classifier ensemble is crucial and performance is significantly increased by

contributes to the ejection of dust particles into interplanetary space. A
crater cavity forms against the mechanical strength of the surface,
gravitational acceleration, or both. The formation of moderately sized craters
that are sufficiently larger than the thickness of the regolith on small
bodies, in which mechanical strength plays the dominant role rather than
gravitational acceleration, is in the strength regime. The formation of
microcraters on blocks on the surface is also within the strength regime. On
the other hand, the formation of a crater of a size comparable to the thickness
of the regolith is affected by both gravitational acceleration and cohesion
between regolith particles. In this short review, we compile data from the
literature pertaining to impact cratering experiments on porous targets, and
summarize the ratio of spall diameter to pit diameter, the depth, diameter, and
volume of the crater cavity, and the ratio of depth to diameter. Among targets
with various porosities studied in the laboratory to date, based on
conventional scaling laws (Holsapple and Schmidt, J. Geophys. Res., 87,

comparison with microcraters formed on a glass target with impact velocities up

Hindi and in general all Indian languages are morphologically richer than

divergent language pairs, for English to Indian language translation, we need
more linguistic information (such as morphology, parse tree, parts of speech
tags, etc.) on the source side. Factored models seem to be useful in this case,
as Factored models consider word as a vector of factors. These factors can
contain any information about the surface word and use it while translating.
Hence, the objective of this work is to handle morphological inflections in
Hindi and Marathi using Factored translation models while translating from
English. SMT approaches face the problem of data sparsity while translating
into a morphologically rich language. It is very unlikely for a parallel corpus
to contain all morphological forms of words. We propose a solution to generate
these unseen morphological forms and inject them into original training
corpora. In this paper, we study factored models and the problem of sparseness
in context of translation to morphologically rich languages. We propose a
simple and effective solution which is based on enriching the input with
various morphological forms of words. We observe that morphology injection
improves the quality of translation in terms of both adequacy and fluency. We
verify this with the experiments on two morphologically rich languages: Hindi

representations of the nodes of a graph. This paper proposes a generalisation
of the latent position network model known as the random dot product graph, to
allow interpretation of those vector representations as latent position
estimates. The generalisation is needed to model heterophilic connectivity
(e.g., `opposites attract') and to cope with negative eigenvalues more
generally. We show that, whether the adjacency or normalised Laplacian matrix
is used, spectral embedding produces uniformly consistent latent position
estimates with asymptotically Gaussian error (up to identifiability). The
standard and mixed membership stochastic block models are special cases in
which the latent positions take only $K$ distinct vector values, representing
communities, or live in the $(K-1)$-simplex with those vertices, respectively.
Under the stochastic block model, our theory suggests spectral clustering using
a Gaussian mixture model (rather than $K$-means) and, under mixed membership,
fitting the minimum volume enclosing simplex, existing recommendations
previously only supported under non-negative-definite assumptions. Empirical
improvements in link prediction (over the random dot product graph), and the
potential to uncover richer latent structure (than posited under the standard
or mixed membership stochastic block models) are demonstrated in a
cyber-security example.

random community models inspired by the recent theoretical and practical
advancement in community detection. While being a topic of fundamental
theoretical interest, our main contribution is to show that many practical
community structures are better explained by the geometric block model. We also
show that a simple triangle-counting algorithm to detect communities in the
geometric block model is near-optimal. Indeed, even in the regime where the
average degree of the graph grows only logarithmically with the number of
vertices (sparse-graph), we show that this algorithm performs extremely well,
both theoretically and practically. In contrast, the triangle-counting

our results on both real and synthetic datasets to show superior performance of
both the new model as well as our algorithm.

have been at the focus of research for several decades because of the relevance

This article introduces the principles and underlying concepts relevant for
fluorescence of nanostructured silicon such as excitation, energy relaxation,
radiative and non-radiative decay pathways and surface passivation.
Experimental methods for the production of silicon clusters are presented. The
geometric and electronic properties are reviewed and the implications for the
ability to emit fluorescence are discussed. Free and pure silicon clusters
produced in molecular beams appear to have properties that are unfavourable for
light emission. However, when passivated or embedded in a suitable host, they
may emit fluorescence. The current available data show that both quantum
confinement and localised transitions, often at the surface, are responsible
for fluorescence. By building silicon clusters atom by atom, and by embedding
them in shells atom by atom, new insights into the microscopic origins of
fluorescence from nanoscale silicon can be expected.

create a set of convex free-space clusters, which are the vertices of the
topological map. We show that this representation improves the efficiency of
global planning, and we provide a complete derivation of our algorithm.
Planning experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that we achieve similar
performance as RRT* with significantly lower computation times and storage
requirements. Finally, we test our algorithm on a mobile robotic platform to

to continuous univariate distributions supported on a bounded interval. The
ideas behind the mathematical formulation of this new distribution come from
computer aid geometric design, specifically from Bezier curves. First, we
review general properties of a distribution given by parametric equations and
extend the definition of a Bezier distribution. Then, after proposing the BMT
cumulative distribution function, we derive its probability density function
and a closed-form expression for quantile function, median, interquartile
range, mode, and moments. The domain change from [0,1] to [c,d] is mentioned.
Estimation of parameters is approached by the methods of maximum likelihood and
maximum product of spacing. We test the numerical estimation procedures using
some simulated data. Usefulness and flexibility of the new distribution are
illustrated in three real data sets. The BMT distribution has a significant
potential to estimate domain parameters and to model data outside the scope of
the beta or similar distributions.

Dirac eigenmodes. In the Dirac spectral representation, there appears a power
of the Dirac eigenvalue $\lambda_n$ such as $\lambda_n^{N_t-1}$, which behaves
as a reduction factor for small $\lambda_n$. Consequently, since this reduction
factor cannot be cancelled, the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes give negligibly
small contribution to the confinement quantities,while they are essential for
chiral symmetry breaking. These relations indicate no direct, one-to-one
correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. In
other words, there is some independence of quark confinement from chiral
symmetry breaking, which can generally lead to different transition
temperatures/densities for deconfinement and chiral restoration. We also
investigate the Polyakov loop in terms of the eigenmodes of the Wilson, the
clover and the domain-wall fermion kernels, respectively, and find the similar
results. The independence of quark confinement from chiral symmetry breaking
seems to be natural, because confinement is realized independently of quark
masses and heavy quarks are also confined even without the chiral symmetry.
