Considering the 3D nature of lung CT data, two 3D networks are designed for the

R-CNN is designed for nodule detection with a U-net-like encoder-decoder
structure to effectively learn nodule features. For nodule classification,
gradient boosting machine (GBM) with 3D dual path network (DPN) features is
proposed. The nodule classification subnetwork is validated on a public dataset
from LIDC-IDRI, on which it achieves better performance than state-of-the-art
approaches, and surpasses the average performance of four experienced doctors.
For the DeepLung system, candidate nodules are detected first by the nodule
detection subnetwork, and nodule diagnosis is conducted by the classification
subnetwork. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the DeepLung is
comparable to the experienced doctors both for the nodule-level and
patient-level diagnosis on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.

(crests), develop in the brain. This feature, common to many gyrencephalic
species including humans, has attracted recent attention from soft matter
physicists. It occurs due to inhomogeneous, and predominantly tangential,
growth of the cortex, which causes circumferential compression, leading to a
bifurcation of the solution path to a folded configuration. The problem can be
framed as one of buckling in the regime of linearized elasticity. However, the
brain is a very soft solid, which is subject to large strains due to
inhomogeneous growth. As a consequence, the morphomechanics of the developing
brain demonstrates an extensive post-bifurcation regime. Nonlinear elasticity
studies of growth-driven brain folding have established the conditions
necessary for the onset of folding, and for its progression to configurations
broadly resembling gyrencephalic brains. The reference, unfolded,
configurations in these treatments have a high degree of symmetry--typically,
ellipsoidal. Depending on the boundary conditions, the folded configurations
have symmetric or anti-symmetric patterns. However, these configurations do not
approximate the actual morphology of, e.g., human brains, which display
unsymmetric folding. More importantly, from a neurodevelopmental standpoint,
many of the unsymmetric sulci and gyri are notably robust in their locations.
Here, we initiate studies on the physical mechanisms and geometry that control
the development of primary sulci and gyri. In this preliminary communication we
carry out computations with idealized geometries, boundary conditions and
parameters, seeking a pattern resembling one of the first folds to form: the
Central Sulcus.

separates multi-component signals into single oscillatory modes called
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each of which can generally be associated to a
physical meaning of the process from which the signal is obtained. When the
phenomena of mode mixing occur, as a result of the EMD sifting process, the
IMFs can lose their physical meaning hindering the interpretation of the
results of the analysis. In the paper, ""One or Two frequencies? The Empirical
Mode Decomposition Answers"", Gabriel Rilling and Patrick Flandrin [3] presented
a rigorous mathematical analysis that explains how EMD behaves in the case of a
composite two-tones signal and the amplitude and frequency ratios by which EMD
will perform a good separation of tones. However, the authors did not propose a
solution for separating the neighboring tones that will naturally remain mixed
after an EMD. In this paper, based on the findings by Rilling and Flandrin, a
method that can separate neighbouring spectral components, that will naturally
remain within a single IMF, is presented. This method is based on reversing the
conditions by which mode mixing occurs and that were presented in the map by
Rilling and Flandrin in the above mentioned paper. Numerical experiments with
signals containing closely spaced spectral components shows the effective
separation of modes that EMD can perform after this principle is applied. The
results verify also the regimes presented in the theoretical analysis by

the short-time dynamics can be described even quantitatively by an equation of

unexpected effects at intermediate and long times: local particle currents far
away from the dissipative site start to reverse direction ultimately leading to
a metastable state with a total particle current pointing away from the lossy

that the reversal of currents can be understood qualitatively by the creation
of holon-doublon pairs at the edge of the region of reduced particle density.
The doublons are then able to escape while the holes move towards the

Mexican families out of poverty. One key challenge they face is matching people
who have social service needs with the services SEDESOL can provide accurately
and efficiently. In this work we describe two specific applications implemented
in collaboration with SEDESOL to enhance their distribution of social services.
The first problem relates to systematic underreporting on applications for
social services, which makes it difficult to identify where to prioritize
outreach. Responding that five people reside in a home when only three do is a
type of underreporting that could occur while a social worker conducts a home
survey with a family to determine their eligibility for services. The second
involves approximating multidimensional poverty profiles across households.
That is, can we characterize different types of vulnerabilities -- for example,
food insecurity and lack of health services -- faced by those in poverty?
  We detail the problem context, available data, our machine learning
formulation, experimental results, and effective feature sets. As far as we are
aware this is the first time government data of this scale has been used to
combat poverty within Mexico. We found that survey data alone can suggest
potential underreporting.
  Further, we found geographic features useful for housing and service related
indicators and transactional data informative for other dimensions of poverty.
The results from our machine learning system for estimating poverty profiles

basis functions are capable of reconciling the competing demands of the
spherically symmetric Coulombic interaction and cylindrical magnetic ($B$
field) confinement. However, the best available {\it a priori} procedure for
composing highly accurate AGTO sets for atoms in a strong $B$ field [Phys.\
Rev. A {\bf 90}, 022504 (2014)] yields very large basis sets. Their size is
problematical for use in any calculation with unfavorable computational cost
scaling. Here we provide an alternative constructive procedure. It is based
upon analysis of the underlying physics of atoms in $B$ fields that allows
identification of several principles for the construction of AGTO basis sets.
Aided by numerical optimization and parameter fitting, followed by fine tuning
of fitting parameters, we devise formulae for generating accurate AGTO basis
sets in an arbitrary $B$ field. For the hydrogen iso-electronic sequence, a set
depends on $B$ field strength, nuclear charge, and upon orbital quantum
numbers. For multi-electron systems, the basis set formulae also include
adjustment to account for orbital occupations. Tests of the new basis sets for
atoms H through C ($1 \le Z \le 6$), and ions Li$^+$, Be$^+$, and B$^+$, in a
wide $B$ field range ($0 \le B \le 2000$ a.u.), show an accuracy better than a
few $\mu$H for single-electron systems, and a few hundredths to a few mHs for
multi-electron atoms. The relative errors are similar for different atoms and
ions in a large $B$ field range, from a few to a couple of tens of millionths,
thereby confirming rather uniform accuracy across the nuclear charge $Z$ and
$B$ field strength values. Residual basis set errors are two to three orders of

proposed only for the growth regime, i.e. non-interacting voids. The aim of
this study is thus to provide a yield criterion for nanoporous materials
relevant for the coalescence regime, i.e. when plastic flow is localized
between voids. Through homogenization and limit analysis, and accounting for
interface stresses at the void-matrix interface, analytical coalescence
criterion is derived under the following conditions: axisymmetric loading,
orthotropic material obeying Hill's plasticity, cylindrical voids in
cylindrical unit-cell. Incidentally, an orthotropic extension of the existing
isotropic modeling of interface stresses through limit analysis is described
and used. The proposed coalescence criterion is then extended to account for
combined tension and shear loading conditions. Numerical limit analyses have
been performed under specific conditions / materials parameters to get
supposedly exact (up to numerical errors) results of coalescence stress. A good
agreement between the analytical coalescence criteria derived in this study and
numerical results is found for elongated spheroidal voids, making them usable
to predict the onset of void coalescence in ductile fracture modeling of

enhance the quality of speech signals that have been recorded in an enclosed

approximation of the convolutive transfer function (NCTF), and to additionally
exploit the spectral properties of the speech signal, such as the low rank
nature of the speech spectrogram, the speech spectrogram is modeled using
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Two methods are described to combine
the NCTF and NMF models. In the first method, referred to as the integrated
method, a cost function is constructed by directly integrating the speech NMF
model into the NCTF model, while in the second method, referred to as the
weighted method, the NCTF and NMF based cost functions are weighted and summed.
Efficient update rules are derived to solve both optimization problems. In
addition, an extension of the integrated method is presented, which exploits
the temporal dependencies of the speech signal. Several experiments are
performed on reverberant speech signals with and without background noise,
where the integrated method yields a considerably higher speech quality than
the baseline NCTF method and a state of the art spectral enhancement method.
Moreover, the experimental results indicate that the weighted method can even
lead to a better performance in terms of instrumental quality measures, but
that the optimal weighting parameter depends on the room acoustics and the
utilized NMF model. Modeling the temporal dependencies in the integrated method
was found to be useful only for highly reverberant conditions.

dynamical systems is an important and practical issue. However, most
traditional methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and have
difficulties in capturing the fat tailed highly intermittent probability
density functions (PDFs) of complex systems in turbulence, neuroscience and
excitable media. In this article, efficient statistically accurate algorithms
are developed for solving both the transient and the equilibrium solutions of
Fokker-Planck equations associated with high-dimensional nonlinear turbulent
dynamical systems with conditional Gaussian structures. The algorithms involve
a hybrid strategy that requires only a small number of ensembles. Here, a
conditional Gaussian mixture in a high-dimensional subspace via an extremely
efficient parametric method is combined with a judicious non-parametric
Gaussian kernel density estimation in the remaining low-dimensional subspace.
Particularly, the parametric method provides closed analytical formulae for
determining the conditional Gaussian distributions in the high-dimensional
subspace and is therefore computationally efficient and accurate. The full
non-Gaussian PDF of the system is then given by a Gaussian mixture. Different
from the traditional particle methods, each conditional Gaussian distribution
here covers a significant portion of the high-dimensional PDF. Therefore a
small number of ensembles is sufficient to recover the full PDF, which
overcomes the curse of dimensionality. Notably, the mixture distribution has a
significant skill in capturing the transient behavior with fat tails of the
high-dimensional non-Gaussian PDFs, and this facilitates the algorithms in
accurately describing the intermittency and extreme events in complex turbulent
systems.

potential of the model features an approximate inflection point arising from
two-loop order logarithmic corrections in well-motivated and perturbative
particle physics examples. This feature decelerates the inflaton before the end
of inflation, enhancing the primordial spectrum of scalar fluctuations and
triggering efficient black hole production with a peaked mass distribution. At
larger field values, inflation occurs thanks to a generic small coupling
between the inflaton and the curvature of spacetime. We compute accurately the
peak mass and abundance of the primordial black holes using the Press-Schechter
and Mukhanov-Sasaki formalisms, showing that the slow-roll approximation fails
to reproduce the correct results by orders of magnitude. We study as well a
qualitatively similar implementation of the idea, where the approximate
inflection point is due to competing terms in a generic polynomial potential.
In both models, requiring a significant part of the dark matter abundance to be
in the form of black holes implies a small blue scalar tilt with a sizable
negative running and a tensor spectrum that may be detected by the
next-generation probes of the cosmic microwave background. We also comment on

photoproduction in the generated magnetic field. We propose a rough criterion

rate $\Gamma= 0.02-0.2$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ at redshift $z=0$. A few IMBHs
orbiting the SMBH favour the formation of massive pairs that coalescence within
a Hubble time, being the merger rate for this channel $\Gamma =0.03$ yr$^{-1}$
Gpc$^{-3}$. Recoiling kicks post-merger can eject the remnant from the galaxy
centre, especially in dwarf galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism
can lead to up to $10^5$ ejected SMBH within 1 Gpc. An IMBH co-existing with a
few single and binary BHs in the same cluster can affect significantly their

BHBs coalescence ($\Gamma =2-8$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$). In a few simulations,
the SMBH boosts BHBs coalescence, leading this process to a merger rate $\Gamma

nucleus can be erroneously estimated $\sim 30\%$ heavier than it really is
because of the Doppler shift of the wave frequency as caused by the rapid
motion around the SMBH. All our simulations are carried out using an $N$-body

An analysis of the asymmetric nebular H-alpha line and of the peculiar
radioactive tail made it possible to recover parameters of the asymmetric
bipolar Ni-56 ejecta with the heavier jet residing in the rear hemisphere. The
inferred Ni-56 mass is 0.039 Msun, twice as large compared to a straightforward
estimate from the bolometric luminosity at the early radioactive tail. The bulk
of ejected Ni-56 has velocities in the range of 4000-6500 km/s. The linear
polarization predicted by the model with the asymmetric ionization produced by
bipolar Ni-56 ejecta is consistent with the observational value.

that, despite the use of multi-word units, thesauri tend to represent concepts

analyze pulsed field gradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion. Anomalous diffusion
exists in many systems such as in polymer or biological systems. PFG anomalous
diffusion could be analyzed based on the fractal derivative or the fractional
derivative. Compared to the fractional derivative, the fractal derivative is
simpler, and it is faster in numerical evaluations. In this paper, the fractal
derivative is employed to build the modified-Bloch equation that is a
fundamental method to describe the spin magnetization evolution affected by
fractional diffusion, Larmor precession, and relaxation. An equivalent form of
the fractal derivative is proposed to convert the fractional diffusion
equation, which can then be combined with the precession and relaxation
equations to get the modified-Bloch equation. This modified-Bloch equation
yields a general PFG signal attenuation expression that includes the finite
gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect, namely, the signal attenuation during field
gradient pulse. The FGPW effect needs to be considered in most clinical MRI
applications, and including FGPW effect allows the detecting of slower
diffusion that is often encountered in polymer systems. Additionally, the
spin-spin relaxation effect can be analyzed, which provides a broad view of the
dynamic process in materials. The modified-Bloch equation based on the fractal
derivative could provide a fundamental theoretical model for PFG anomalous
diffusion.

layers, it is of interest to examine the layer-dependent electronic properties
of BLP QDs, such as the electronic distributions over the two layers and the
so-produced layer-polarization features, and to see how these properties are
affected by the magnetic field and the bias potential. We find that in the
absence of a bias potential only edge states are layer-polarized while the bulk
states are not, and the layer-polarization degree (LPD) of the unbiased edge
states increases with increasing magnetic field. However, in the presence of a
bias potential both the edge and bulk states are layer-polarized, and the LPD
of the bulk (edge) states depends strongly (weakly) on the interplay of the
bias potential and the interlayer coupling. At high magnetic fields, applying a
bias potential renders the bulk electrons in a BLP QD to be mainly distributed
over the top or bottom layer, resulting in layer-polarized bulk Landau levels
(LLs). In the presence of a large bias potential that can drive a
semiconductor-to-semimetal transition in BLP, these bulk LLs exhibit different
magnetic-field dependences, i.e., the zeroth LLs exhibit a linear-like
dependence on the magnetic field while the other LLs exhibit a square-root-like
dependence.

research areas including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural
language processing. However, recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial manipulations at testing time. Specifically, suppose
we have a testing example, whose label can be correctly predicted by a DNN
classifier. An attacker can add a small carefully crafted noise to the testing
example such that the DNN classifier predicts an incorrect label, where the
crafted testing example is called adversarial example. Such attacks are called
evasion attacks. Evasion attacks are one of the biggest challenges for
deploying DNNs in safety and security critical applications such as
self-driving cars. In this work, we develop new methods to defend against
evasion attacks. Our key observation is that adversarial examples are close to
the classification boundary. Therefore, we propose region-based classification
to be robust to adversarial examples. For a benign/adversarial testing example,
we ensemble information in a hypercube centered at the example to predict its
label. In contrast, traditional classifiers are point-based classification,
i.e., given a testing example, the classifier predicts its label based on the
testing example alone. Our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that our region-based classification can significantly mitigate
evasion attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy on benign examples.
Specifically, our region-based classification achieves the same classification
accuracy on testing benign examples as point-based classification, but our
region-based classification is significantly more robust than point-based
classification to various evasion attacks.

accurate algorithms for solving the Fokker-Planck equations associated with
high-dimensional nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems with conditional
Gaussian structures. Despite the conditional Gaussianity, these nonlinear
systems contain many strong non-Gaussian features such as intermittency and
fat-tailed probability density functions (PDFs). The algorithms involve a
hybrid strategy that requires only a small number of samples $L$ to capture
both the transient and the equilibrium non-Gaussian PDFs with high accuracy.
Here, a conditional Gaussian mixture in a high-dimensional subspace via an
extremely efficient parametric method is combined with a judicious Gaussian
kernel density estimation in the remaining low-dimensional subspace. Rigorous
analysis shows that the mean integrated squared error in the recovered PDFs in
the high-dimensional subspace is bounded by the inverse square root of the
determinant of the conditional covariance, where the conditional covariance is
completely determined by the underlying dynamics and is independent of $L$.
This is fundamentally different from a direct application of kernel methods to
solve the full PDF, where $L$ needs to increase exponentially with the
dimension of the system and the bandwidth shrinks. A detailed comparison
between different methods justifies that the efficient statistically accurate
algorithms are able to overcome the curse of dimensionality. It is also shown
with mathematical rigour that these algorithms are robust in long time provided
that the system is controllable and stochastically stable. Particularly,
dynamical systems with energy-conserving quadratic nonlinearity as in many
geophysical and engineering turbulence are proved to have these properties.

constraint $g(x)\in\!K$, where $g\!:\mathbb{X}\to\mathbb{Y}$ is a twice
continuously differentiable mapping and $K\subseteq\mathbb{Y}$ is a nonempty
closed convex set assumed to be $C^2$-cone reducible. Such a generalized
derivative plays a crucial role in characterizing isolated calmness of the
solution maps to generalized equations whose multivalued parts are modeled via
the normals to the nonconvex set $\Gamma=g^{-1}(K)$. The main contribution of
this paper is to provide an exact characterization for the graphical derivative
of the normals to this class of nonconvex conic constraints under an assumption
without requiring the nondegeneracy of the reference point as the papers

  Relationships",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-view data are increasingly prevalent in practice. It is often relevant
to analyze the relationships between pairs of views by multi-view component
analysis techniques such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). However, data
may easily exhibit nonlinear relations, which CCA cannot reveal. We aim to
investigate the usefulness of nonlinear multi-view relations to characterize
multi-view data in an explainable manner. To address this challenge, we propose
a method to characterize globally nonlinear multi-view relationships as a
mixture of linear relationships. A clustering method, it identifies partitions
of observations that exhibit the same relationships and learns those
relationships simultaneously. It defines cluster variables by multi-view rather
than spatial relationships, unlike almost all other clustering methods.
Furthermore, we introduce a supervised classification method that builds on our
clustering method by employing multi-view relationships as discriminative
factors. The value of these methods resides in their capability to find useful
structure in the data that single-view or current multi-view methods may
struggle to find. We demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed approach
using an application in clinical informatics to detect and characterize slow
bleeding in patients whose central venous pressure (CVP) is monitored at the
bedside. Presently, CVP is considered an insensitive measure of a subject's
intravascular volume status or its change. However, we reason that features of
CVP during inspiration and expiration should be informative in early
identification of emerging changes of patient status. We empirically show how
the proposed method can help discover and analyze multiple-to-multiple
correlations, which could be nonlinear or vary throughout the population, by
finding explainable structure of operational interest to practitioners.

communities, where some nodes may have mixed memberships. We assume that for
each node $1 \leq i \leq n$, there is a probability mass function $\pi_i$
defined over $\{1, 2, \ldots, K\}$ such that \[ \pi_i(k) = \mbox{the weight of
node $i$ on community $k$}, \qquad 1 \leq k \leq K. \] The goal is to estimate
$\{\pi_i, 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ (i.e., membership estimation).
  We model the network with the {\it degree-corrected mixed membership (DCMM)}
model \cite{Mixed-SCORE}. Since for many natural networks, the degrees have an
approximate power-law tail, we allow {\it severe degree heterogeneity} in our
model.
  For any membership estimation $\{\hat{\pi}_i, 1 \leq i \leq n\}$, since each
$\pi_i$ is a probability mass function, it is natural to measure the errors by
the average $\ell^1$-norm \[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \| \hat{\pi}_i -
\pi_i\|_1. \] We also consider a variant of the $\ell^1$-loss, where each
$\|\hat{\pi}_i - \pi_i\|_1$ is re-weighted by the degree parameter $\theta_i$
in DCMM (to be introduced).
  We present a sharp lower bound. We also show that such a lower bound is
achievable under a broad situation. More discussion in this vein is continued
in our forthcoming manuscript.
  The results are very different from those on community detection. For
community detection, the focus is on the special case where all $\pi_i$ are
degenerate; the goal is clustering, so Hamming distance is the natural choice
of loss function, and the rate can be exponentially fast. The setting here is
broader and more difficult: it is more natural to use the $\ell^1$-loss, and
the rate is only polynomially fast.

superhydrophobic surfaces aiming for scalable applications use random
distribution of roughness, such as spray coating and etched process. However,
most of previous analyses of the interaction between flows and superhydrophobic
surfaces studied periodic geometries that are economically feasible only in
lab-scale experiments. We conduct direct numerical simulations of turbulent
flows over randomly patterned interfaces considering a range of texture widths
$w^+\approx 4-26$, and solid fractions $\phi_s=11\%$ to $25\%$. Slip and
no-slip boundary conditions are implemented in a pattern, modeling the presence
of gas-liquid interfaces and solid elements. Our results indicate that slip of
randomly distributed textures under turbulent flows are about $30\%$ less than
those of surfaces with aligned features of the same size. In the small texture
size limit $w^+\approx 4$, the slip length of the randomly distributed textures
in turbulent flows is well described by a previously introduced Stokes flow
solution of randomly distributed shear-free holes. By comparing DNS results for
patterned slip and no-slip boundary against the corresponding homogenized slip
length boundary conditions, we show that turbulent flows over randomly
distributed posts can be represented by an isotropic slip length in streamwise
and spanwise direction. The average pressure fluctuation on gas pocket is
similar to that of the aligned features with the same texture size and gas
fraction, but the maximum interface deformation at the leading edge of the
roughness element is about twice larger when the textures are randomly
distributed.

notion of virtual molecular dynamics is introduced here based on temporal
coarse-graining via Pade approximants and the Ito formula for stochastic
processes. It is demonstrated that this framework leads to significant
efficiency over traditional molecular dynamics and avoids the need to introduce
coarse-grained variables and phenomenological equations for their evolution. In
this framework, an all-atom trajectory is represented by a Markov chain of
virtual atomic states at a discrete sequence of timesteps, transitions between

Pade approximants and a microstate energy annealing methodology. The latter is
achieved by a conventional and an MD NVE energy minimization schemes. This

solutions for the scalar conservation laws (see Panov [Mat. Zametki,

multivariate distribution as a generating process. As a result, the variational
lower bound of the joint likelihood can be optimized via a conditional
variational auto-encoder and trained end-to-end on GPUs. Our MEDL_CVAE was
motivated by two real-world applications in computational sustainability: one
studies the spatial correlation among multiple bird species using the eBird
data and the other models multi-dimensional landscape composition and human
footprint in the Amazon rainforest with satellite images. We show that
MEDL_CVAE captures rich dependency structures, scales better than previous
methods, and further improves on the joint likelihood taking advantage of very
large datasets that are beyond the capacity of previous methods.

regression models for bounded responses based on this distribution and their
application is illustrated by considering modeling a real life data on risk

with beta regression and Log-Lindley regression models. Much better fits for
both data sets justify the relevance of the new distribution in statistical
modeling and analysis. Furthermore this generalization, apart from adding
flexibility for modelling, retains the compactness and tractability of
statistical quantities required for statistical analysis, which is a feature of
the Log-Lindley distribution. Thus, the generalized Log-Lindley distribution

predicted to lead to a number of interesting phenomena, such as the Chiral
Magnetic Effect (CME). While several experimental observations are partially
consistent with predictions of a CME signal, it is hard to distinguish them
unambiguously from a combination of more mundane phenomena present in the
anisotropic expansion of the QGP. This makes it imperative to establish that
the early-time magnetic field has observable consequences not related to the
anomalous QCD effects on final-state charged particles and to calibrate its
strength. We test a recent prediction of a pure electromagnetic effect, which
may arise in heavy-ion collisions. The varying magnetic field would induce a
current within the QGP, which is expected to leave a very peculiar imprint on
final-state particles: a contribution to directed flow which is asymmetric both

neural systems that allows neurons to maintain their activity around a
functional operating point. This phenomenon can be used in neuromorphic systems
to compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts in the system
configuration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning
processes active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the
homeostatic plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer
than conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this paper we present an
ultra-low leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme,
that can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long
time scales. Synaptic scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights
of all synapses impinging onto a neuron maintaining their relative differences,
to preserve the effects of learning. The scheme we propose controls the global
gain of analog log-domain synapse circuits to keep the neuron's average firing
rate constant around a set operating point, over extremely long time scales. To
validate the proposed scheme, we implemented the ultra-low leakage synaptic
scaling homeostatic plasticity circuit in a standard 0.18 $\mu$m Complementary
Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated it in an array of
dynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. The
circuit occupies a silicon area of 84 $\mu$m x 22 $\mu$m and consumes
approximately 10.8 nW with a 1.8 V supply voltage. We present experimental
results from the homeostatic circuit and demonstrate how it can be configured
to exhibit time scales of up to 100 kilo-seconds, thanks to a controllable
leakage current that can be scaled down to 0.45 atto-Amperes (2.8 electrons/s).

equations of motion is derived by fitting circular arcs through every three
consecutive points of the discretized trajectory, so that the tangent and the
curvature satisfy the equations exactly at every central point. This scheme is
reversible and robust, and allows an adaptive step size control. Its
performance is tested by computing the thermodynamic properties of simple
pair-potential models, and its chemical application is shown for the global
search for stable structures, using canonical sampling and energy minimization,
of hydrogen-bonded molecular clusters.

load. We study the twist-stretch relation for a set of short DNA molecules
modeled by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian. Finite temperature path integral
techniques are applied to generate a large ensemble of possible configurations
for the base pairs of the sequence. The model also accounts for the bending and
twisting fluctuations between adjacent base pairs along the molecules stack.
Simulating a broad range of twisting conformation, we compute the helix
structural parameters by averaging over the ensemble of base pairs
configurations. The method selects, for any applied force, the average twist
angle which minimizes the molecule's free energy. It is found that the chains
generally over-twist under an applied stretching and the over-twisting is
physically associated to the contraction of the average helix diameter, i.e. to
the damping of the base pair fluctuations. Instead, assuming that the maximum
amplitude of the bending fluctuations may decrease against the external load,
the DNA molecule first over-twists for weak applied forces and then untwists
above a characteristic force value. Our results are discussed in relation to
available experimental information albeit for kilo-base long molecules.

LONEOS, WISE or Catalina. These data are a rich source of information about the
physical properties of asteroids. There are several possible approaches for
utilizing these data. Lightcurve inversion is a typical method that works with
individual asteroids. Our approach in this paper is statistical when we focused
on large groups of asteroids like dynamical families and taxonomic classes, and
the data were not sufficient for individual models.
  Aims. Our aim was to study the distributions of shape elongation $b/a$ and
the spin axis latitude $\beta$ for various subpopulations of asteroids and to
compare our results, based on Pan-STARRS1 survey, with statistics previously
done using different photometric data (Lowell database, WISE data).
  Methods. We use the LEADER algorithm to compare the $b/a$ and $\beta$
distributions for different subpopulations of asteroids. The algorithm creates
a cumulative distributive function (CDF) of observed brightness variations, and
computes the $b/a$ and $\beta$ distributions using analytical basis functions
that yield the observed CDF. A variant of LEADER is used to solve the joint
distributions for synthetic populations to test the validity of the method.
  Results. When comparing distributions of shape elongation for groups of
asteroids with different diameters $D$, we found that there are no differences
for $D < 25$ km. We also constructed distributions for asteroids with different
rotation periods and revealed that the fastest rotators with $P = 0 - 4$ h are
more spheroidal than the population with $P = 4 - 8$ h.

geometrical frustration is studied in the Kondo lattice on the one-dimensional
zigzag ladder. Using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the
ground state and various short- and long-range spin- and density-correlation
functions are calculated for the model at half-filling as a function of the
antiferromagnetic Kondo interaction down to $J=0.3t$ where $t$ is the
nearest-neighbor hopping on the zigzag ladder. Geometrical frustration is shown
to lead to at least two critical points: Starting from the strong-$J$ limit,
where almost local Kondo screening dominates and where the system is a
nonmagnetic Kondo insulator, antiferromagnetic correlations between
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor local spins become stronger and
stronger, until at $J^{\rm dim}_{\rm c} \approx 0.89t$ frustration is
alleviated by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry and a
corresponding transition to a dimerized state. This is characterized by
antiferromagnetic correlations along the legs and by alternating antiferro- and
ferromagnetic correlations on the rungs of the ladder. A mechanism of partial
Kondo screening that has been suggested for the Kondo lattice on the
two-dimensional triangular lattice is not realized in the one-dimensional case.
Furthermore, within the symmetry-broken dimerized state, there is a magnetic
transition to a $90^{\circ}$ quantum spin spiral with quasi-long-range order at
$J^{\rm mag}_{\rm c} \approx 0.84t$. The quantum-critical point is
characterized by a closure of the spin gap (with decreasing $J$) and a
divergence of the spin-correlation length and of the spin-structure factor
$S(q)$ at wave vector $q=\pi/2$. This is opposed to the model on the
one-dimensional bipartite chain, which is known to have a finite spin gap for
all $J>0$ at half-filling.

Beauville's splitting principle, we formulate a conjectural Section Property
which predicts that for smooth projective holomorphic symplectic varieties
there exists such a section of algebra whose image contains all the Chern

necessarily symplectic) varieties with Chow motive of abelian type. We
introduce the notion of symmetrically distinguished abelian motive and use it
to provide a sufficient condition for a smooth projective variety to admit such
a section. We then give series of examples of varieties for which our theory
works. For instance, we prove the existence of such a section for arbitrary
products of varieties with Chow groups of finite rank, abelian varieties,
hyperelliptic curves, Fermat cubic hypersurfaces, Hilbert schemes of points on
an abelian surface or a Kummer surface or a K3 surface with Picard number at

for the conjectural Section Property and exemplify the mantra that the motives
of holomorphic symplectic varieties should behave as the motives of abelian
varieties, as algebra objects.

in inter-planetary and deep space networks, and frequent link disruptions due
to the mobility of nodes as observed in terrestrial wireless network

involved in the network environment. Therefore, in this document, we present
the documentation of an Urban Delay Tolerant Network Simulator (UDTNSim)

characteristics including mobility models and routing protocols. The mobility
models included in this version of UDTNSim are (i) Stationary Movement, (ii)
Simple Random Movement, (iii) Path Type Based Movememt, (iv) Path Memory Based
Movement, (v) Path Type with Restricted Movement, and (vi) Path Type with Wait
Movement. In addition to mobility models, we also provide three routing and
data hand-off protocols: (i) Epidemic Routing, (ii) Superior Only Handoff, and
(iii) Superior Peer Handoff. UDTNSim v0.1 is designed using object-oriented

described by Bose-Einstein correlation functions stemming from L\'evy-stable

correlation strength parameter $\lambda$, the L\'evy index of stability
$\alpha$ and the L\'evy length scale parameter $R$ as a function of average
transverse mass of the pair $m_T$. We find that the positively and the
negatively charged pion pairs yield consistent results, and their correlation
functions are represented, within uncertainties, by the same L\'evy-stable
source functions. The $\lambda(m_T)$ measurements indicate a decrease of the
strength of the correlations at low $m_T$. The L\'evy length scale parameter
$R(m_T)$ decreases with increasing $m_T$, following a hydrodynamically
predicted type of scaling behavior. The values of the L\'evy index of stability
$\alpha$ are found to be significantly lower than the Gaussian case of
$\alpha=2$, but also significantly larger than the conjectured value that may
characterize the critical point of a second-order quark-hadron phase
transition.

functional neural network models are of growing interest for many researchers

learning, with a variety of different models developed over the recent years.
However, most studies in this area are conducted with custom simulation scripts
and manually implemented tasks. This makes it hard for other researchers to
reproduce and build upon previous work and nearly impossible to compare the
performance of different learning architectures. In this work, we present a
novel approach to solve this problem, connecting benchmark tools from the field
of machine learning and state-of-the-art neural network simulators from
computational neuroscience. This toolchain enables researchers in both fields
to make use of well-tested high-performance simulation software supporting
biologically plausible neuron, synapse and network models and allows them to
evaluate and compare their approach on the basis of standardized environments
of varying complexity. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolchain by
implementing a neuronal actor-critic architecture for reinforcement learning in
the NEST simulator and successfully training it on two different environments

design for small-scale aerobatic helicopters, and proposes two singularity free
robust attitude tracking controllers based on the available states for
feedback. 1. The first, employs the angular velocity and the flap angle states
(a variable that is not easy to measure) and uses a backstepping technique to
design a robust compensator (BRC) to \textbf{\textit{actively}} suppress the
disturbance induced tracking error. 2. The second exploits the inherent damping
present in the helicopter dynamics leading to a structure preserving,
\textbf{\textit{passively}} robust controller (SPR), which is free of angular
velocity and flap angle feedback. The BRC controller is designed to be robust
in the presence of two types of uncertainties: structured and unstructured. The
structured disturbance is due to uncertainty in the rotor parameters, and the
unstructured perturbation is modeled as an exogenous torque acting on the
fuselage. The performance of the controller is demonstrated in the presence of
both types of disturbances through numerical simulations. In contrast, the SPR
tracking controller is derived such that the tracking error dynamics inherits
the natural damping characteristic of the helicopter. The SPR controller is
shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable and its performance is
evaluated experimentally by performing aggressive flip maneuvers. Throughout
the study, a nonlinear coupled rotor-fuselage helicopter model with first order
flap dynamics is used.

unbounded energy growth. This dynamical delocalization is genuinely quantum and
very different from the classical one: using a mean field approximation we see
that the system self-organizes so that the energy per site increases in time as
a power law with exponent smaller than one. This wealth of phenomena is a

classification for outer automorphisms. We extend the theory of algebraic
laminations dual to trees, as developed by Coulbois, Hilion, Lustig and
Reynolds, to the context of free products; this also gives us an opportunity to
give a unified account of this theory. We first show that any $\mathbb{R}$-tree
with dense orbits in the boundary of the corresponding outer space can be
reconstructed as a quotient of the boundary of the group by its dual
lamination. We then describe the dual lamination in terms of a band complex on
compact $\mathbb{R}$-trees (generalizing Coulbois-Hilion-Lustig's compact
heart), and we analyze this band complex using versions of the Rips machine and
of the Rauzy-Veech induction. An important output of the theory is that the
above map from the boundary of the group to the $\mathbb{R}$-tree is 2-to-1
almost everywhere.
  A key point for our intended application is a unique duality result for
arational trees. It says that if two trees have a leaf in common in their dual
laminations, and if one of the trees is arational and relatively free, then
they are equivariantly homeomorphic.
  This statement is an analogue of a result in the free group saying that if
two trees are dual to a common current and one of the trees is free arational,
then the two trees are equivariantly homeomorphic. However, we notice that in
the setting of free products, the continuity of the pairing between trees and
currents fails. For this reason, in all this paper, we work with laminations
rather than with currents.

projects observations onto a random orthogonal basis which is assigned a prior
distribution defined on the Stiefel manifold. The prior on factor scores
involves an Indian buffet process to model the uncertainty related to the

the principal components is used to refine this estimate.
  The behaviour of the algorithm is first studied on various synthetic

Denoiser (Neural AIDE), which utilizes neural network in a novel way. Unlike
other neural network based image denoising methods, which typically apply
simple supervised learning to learn a mapping from a noisy patch to a clean
patch, we formulate to train a neural network to learn an \emph{affine} mapping
that gets applied to a noisy pixel, based on its context. Our formulation
enables both supervised training of the network from the labeled training
dataset and adaptive fine-tuning of the network parameters using the given
noisy image subject to denoising. The key tool for devising Neural AIDE is to
devise an estimated loss function of the MSE of the affine mapping, solely
based on the noisy data. As a result, our algorithm can outperform most of the
recent state-of-the-art methods in the standard benchmark datasets. Moreover,
our fine-tuning method can nicely overcome one of the drawbacks of the
patch-level supervised learning methods in image denoising; namely, a
supervised trained model with a mismatched noise variance can be mostly
corrected as long as we have the matched noise variance during the fine-tuning
step.

the deviator anisotropy derived from fabric tensor, and then the evolution of

force-chain orientational order parameter. As packing fraction increases, the
interparticle force increases and finally saturates to an asymptotic value.
Moreover, the grain configurations and force-chain structures become
isotropically random as the tapping-induced compaction proceeds. In contrast,
the total length of force chains remains unchanged. From the correlations of

isotropy of grain configurations and the disordering of force-chain

equations are widely used in engineering design and analysis involving
turbulent flows. However, RANS simulations are known to be unreliable in many
flows of engineering relevance, which is largely caused by model-form
uncertainties associated with the Reynolds stresses. Recently, a
machine-learning approach has been proposed to assist RANS modeling by building
a functional mapping from mean flow features to discrepancies in RANS modeled
Reynolds stresses as compared to high-fidelity data. However, it remains a
challenge to represent discrepancies in the Reynolds stress eigenvectors in
machine learning due to the requirements of spatial smoothness,
frame-independence, and realizability. In this work, we propose three schemes
for representing perturbations to the eigenvectors of RANS modeled Reynolds
stresses: (1) discrepancy-based Euler angles, (2) direct-rotation-based Euler
angles, and (3) unit quaternions. We compare these metrics by performing a
priori and a posteriori tests on two canonical flows: fully developed turbulent
flows in a square duct and massively separated flows over periodic hills. The
results demonstrate that the direct-rotation-based Euler angles representation
lacks spatial smoothness while the discrepancy-based Euler angles
representation lacks frame-independence, making them unsuitable for being used
in machine-learning-assisted turbulence modeling. In contrast, the
representation based on unit quaternion satisfies all the requirements stated
above, and thus it is an ideal choice in representing the perturbations
associated with the eigenvectors of Reynolds stress tensors. This finding has
clear importance for uncertainty quantification and machine learning in
turbulence modeling and for data-driven computational mechanics in general.

We first study the general version where the sensors must form teams to track
individual targets. If the value function is monotonically increasing and
submodular then a greedy algorithm yields a 1/2-approximation. We then study a
restricted version where exactly two sensors must be assigned to each target.
We present a 1/3-approximation algorithm for this problem which holds for
arbitrary value functions (not necessarily submodular or monotone). In addition
to approximation algorithms, we also present various properties of
observability measures. We show that the inverse of the condition number of the
observability matrix is neither monotone nor submodular, but present other
measures which are. Specifically, we show that the trace and rank of the
symmetric observability matrix are monotone and submodular and the log
determinant of the symmetric observability matrix is monotone and submodular
when the matrix is non-singular. If the target's motion model is not known, the
inverse cannot be computed exactly. Instead, we present a lower bound for
distance sensors. In addition to theoretical results, we evaluate our results
empirically through simulations.

scales. In the wave turbulence modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation, we observe states with correlation scales less than the
system size but much larger than the excitation scale. We call such state
precondensate to distinguish it from condensate defined as a system-wide
coherent state. Both condensate and precondensate are characterized by large
scale phase coherence and narrow distribution of amplitudes. When one excites
small scales, precondensate is achieved relatively quickly by an inverse
cascade heating quasi-equilibrium distribution of large-scale modes. The
transition from the precondensate to the system-wide condensate requires much
longer time. The spectra of precondensate differ from quasi-equilibrium and are
characterized by two bending points, one on the scale of the average distance
between vortex pairs, and the other on the scale of the distance between
vortices in a pair. We suggest temporal evolution laws for both lengths and use
them to predict the probability of the transition to condensate.

Einstein gravity in the presence of logarithmic and exponential forms of

nonlinear parameter as thermodynamic quantities which can vary. We obtain
thermodynamic quantities of the system such as pressure, temperature and Gibbs
free energy in an extended phase space. We complete the analogy of the
nonlinear dilaton black holes with Van der Waals liquid-gas system. We work in
the canonical ensemble and hence we treat the charge of the black hole as an
external fixed parameter. Moreover, we calculate the critical values of
temperature, volume and pressure and show they depend on dilaton coupling
constant as well as nonlinear parameter. We also investigate the critical
exponents and find that they are universal and independent of the dilaton and
nonlinear parameters, which is an expected result. {Finally, we explore the
phase transition of nonlinear dilaton black holes by studying the Gibbs free
energy of the system. We find that in case of $T>T_c$, we have no phase
transition. When $T=T_c$, the system admits a second order phase transition,
while for $T=T_{\rm f}<T_c$ the system experiences a first order transition.
Interestingly, for $T_{\rm f}<T<T_c$ we observe a \textit{zeroth order} phase
transition in the presence of dilaton field. This novel \textit{zeroth order}
phase transition is occurred due to a finite jump in Gibbs free energy which is
generated by dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant, $\alpha$, for a certain
range of pressure.}

the fundamental field equations of Heaviside Gravity (HG) of 1893 and
Maxwellian Gravity (MG), which look different from each other due to a sign
difference in some terms of their respective field equations. However, they are
shown to represent two mathematical representations of a single physical theory
of vector gravity that we name here as Heaviside-Maxwellian Gravity (HMG), in
which the speed of gravitational waves in vacuum is uniquely found to be equal
to the speed of light in vacuum. We also corrected a sign error in Heaviside's
speculative gravitational analogue of the Lorentz force law. This spin-1 HMG is
shown to produce attractive force between like masses under static condition,
contrary to the prevalent view of field theorists. Galileo's law of
universality of free fall is a consequence of HMG, without any initial
assumption of the equality of gravitational mass with velocity-dependent mass.
We also note a new set of Lorentz-Maxwell's equations having the same physical
effects as the standard set - a byproduct of our present study.

be described in a wide range of energy scales, starting from high-energy
physics to cosmology and low-energy physics. An usual way to generate a thick
braneworld model relies in coupling a bulk scalar field to higher dimensional
warped gravity. Quite recently, a novel braneworld was generated with the aid
of a tachyonic bulk scalar field, having several remarkable properties. It
comprises a regular and stable solution that contains a relevant 3--brane with
de Sitter induced metric, arising as an exact solution to the 5D field
equations, describing the inflationary eras of our Universe. Besides, it is
{\it asymptotically flat}, despite of the presence of a negative 5D
cosmological constant, which is an interesting feature that contrasts with most
of the known, asymptotically either dS or AdS models. Moreover, it encompasses
a graviton spectrum with a single massless bound state, accounting for 4D
gravity localized on the brane, separated from the continuum of Kaluza-Klein
massive graviton modes by a mass gap that makes the 5D corrections to Newton's
law to decay exponentially. Finally, gauge, scalar and fermion fields are also
shown to be localized on this braneworld. In this work, we show that this
tachyonic braneworld allows for a nontrivial solution with a vanishing 5D
cosmological constant that preserves all the above mentioned remarkable
properties with a less amount of parameters, constituting an important
contribution to the construction of a realistic cosmological braneworld model.

geometrical characteristics of patterns such as orientations and angles are
distorted and misperceived as the result of low- to high-level retinal/cortical
processing. Modelling the detection of tilt in these illusions and their
strengths as they are perceived is a challenging task computationally and leads
to development of techniques that match with human performance. In this study,
we present a predictive and quantitative approach for modeling foveal and
peripheral vision in the induced tilt in Caf\'e Wall illusion in which parallel
mortar lines between shifted rows of black and white tiles appear to converge
and diverge. A bioderived filtering model for the responses of retinal/cortical
simple cells to the stimulus using Difference of Gaussians is utilized with an
analytic processing pipeline introduced in our previous studies to quantify the
angle of tilt in the model. Here we have considered visual characteristics of
foveal and peripheral vision in the perceived tilt in the pattern to predict
different degrees of tilt in different areas of the fovea and periphery as the
eye saccades to different parts of the image. The tilt analysis results from
several sampling sizes and aspect ratios, modelling variant foveal views are
used from our previous investigations on the local tilt, and we specifically
investigate in this work, different configurations of the whole pattern
modelling variant Gestalt views across multiple scales in order to provide
confidence intervals around the predicted tilts. The foveal sample sets are
verified and quantified using two different sampling methods. We present here a
precise and quantified comparison contrasting local tilt detection in the
foveal sets with a global average across all of the Caf\'e Wall configurations

complexity of time series. However, it is extremely sensitive to the
predetermined parameters and length of time series and it may yield an
inaccurate estimation of entropy or cause undefined entropy when the length of
time series is too short. In this paper the Sigmoid-based refined composite
multiscale fuzzy entropy (SRCMFE) is introduced to improve the robustness of
complexity measurement of MFE for short time series analysis. Also SRCMFE is
used to quantify the dynamical properties of mechanical vibration signals and
based on that a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis approach is proposed by
combining SRCMFE with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for
feature dimension and variable predictive models based class discrimination
(VPMCD) for mode classification. In the proposed method, SRCMFE firstly is
employed to extract the complexity characteristic from vibration signals of
rolling bearing and t-SNE for feature dimension reduction is utilized to obtain
a low dimensional manifold characteristic. Then VPMCD is employed to construct
a multi-fault classifier to fulfill an automatic fault diagnosis. Finally, the
proposed approach is applied to experimental data of rolling bearing and the
results indicate that the proposed method can effectively distinguish different
fault categories of rolling bearings.
