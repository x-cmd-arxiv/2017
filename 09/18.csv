accessed. Latest research showed that current organization and retrieval of
music tracks based on album information are inefficient. Moreover, they
demonstrated that people use emotion tags for music tracks in order to search
and retrieve them. In this paper, we discuss separability of a set of emotional
labels, proposed in the categorical emotion expression, using Fisher's
separation theorem. We determine a set of adjectives to tag music parts: happy,
sad, relaxing, exciting, epic and thriller. Temporal, frequency and energy
features have been extracted from the music parts. It could be seen that the
maximum separability within the extracted features occurs between relaxing and
epic music parts. Finally, we have trained a classifier using Support Vector
Machines to automatically recognize and generate emotional labels for a music
part. Accuracy for recognizing each label has been calculated; where the
results show that epic music can be recognized more accurately (77.4%),
comparing to the other types of music.

key of our principle is a tilted arrangement of the micro-channel with respect
to the focal plane of the microscope. This forces cells to traverse the focal
plane in an inclined manner. As a consequence, individual layers of passing
cells are recorded which can then be assembled to obtain the volumetric
representation. The full 3D information allows for a detailed comparisons with
theoretical and numerical predictions unfeasible with e.g.\ 2D imaging. Our
technique is exemplified by studying flowing red blood cells in a micro-channel
reflecting the conditions prevailing in the microvasculature. We observe two
very different types of shapes: `croissants' and `slippers'. Additionally, we
perform 3D numerical simulations of our experiment to confirm the observations.
Since 3D confocal imaging of cells in flow has not yet been realized, we see
high potential in the field of flow cytometry where cell classification thus
far mostly relies on 1D scattering and fluorescence signals.

show that uniform metastable convergence is equivalent to abstract
$\alpha$-uniform convergence for some alpha, and that abstract omega-uniform

  The proof theoretic version, which we call concrete alpha-uniform

first-year Dark Energy Survey data, and confirmed with deeper photometry from
the 4.1 metre Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope. The new system
was detected with a relatively high significance and appears in the DES images
as a compact concentration of faint blue point sources. We determine that DES 3
is located at a heliocentric distance of $\sim 76\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and it is
dominated by an old ($\simeq 9.8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metal-poor
($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\simeq -1.88$) population. While the age and metallicity
values of DES 3 are similar to globular clusters, its half-light radius
($r_\mathrm{h}\sim 6.5\,\mathrm{pc}$) and luminosity ($M_V \sim -1.9$) are more
indicative of faint star clusters. Based on the apparent angular size, DES 3,
with a value of $r_\mathrm{h}\sim 0.\!^{\prime}3$, is among the smallest faint
star clusters known to date. Furthermore, using deeper imaging of DES
J0222.7$-$5217 taken with the SOAR telescope, we update structural parameters
and perform the first isochrone modeling. Our analysis yields the first age
($\simeq 12.6\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metallicity ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\simeq -2.01$)
estimates for this object. The half-light radius ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim
10.5\,\mathrm{pc}$) and luminosity ($M_V\sim -2.7$) of DES J0222.7$-$5217
suggest that it is likely a faint star cluster. The discovery of DES 3
indicates that the census of stellar systems in the Milky Way is still far from
complete, and demonstrates the power of modern wide-field imaging surveys to

to being ""dicontractible"", as in the undirected case). It still remains to
compare this notion with the notion introduced in Dubut et al. 2016, which has
lots of good properties as well. For now, it seems that for reasonable spaces,
this new proposal of directed homotopy equivalence identifies more spaces than
the one of Dubut et al. 2016.

structural metric based on network flow, is an invariant quantity in most
planar graphs. We confirm this invariance through an empirical analysis of
street networks from 97 of the most populous cities worldwide, at scales
significantly larger than previous studies. We also find that the BC
distribution is robust to major alterations in the network, including
significant changes to its topology and edge weight structure, indicating that
the only relevant factors shaping the distribution are the number of nodes and
edges as well as the constraint of planarity. Through simulations of random
planar graph models and analytical calculations on Cayley trees, this
invariance is demonstrated to be a consequence of a bimodal regime consisting
of an underlying tree structure for high BC nodes, and a low BC regime arising
from the presence of loops providing local path alternatives. Furthermore, the
high BC nodes display a non-trivial spatial dependence, with increasing spatial
correlation as a function of the number of edges, leading them to cluster
around the barycenter at large densities. Our results suggest that the spatial
distribution of the BC is a more accurate discriminator when comparing patterns
across cities. Moreover, the BC being a static predictor of congestion in
planar graphs, the observed invariance and spatial dependence has practical
implications for infrastructural and biological networks. In particular, for
the case of street networks, as long as planarity is conserved, bottlenecks
continue to persist, and the effect of planned interventions to alleviate
structural congestion will be limited primarily to load redistribution, a
feature confirmed by analyzing 200 years of data for central Paris.

  Implications for Mathematical Logic","50 pages, 18 figures",,,,"math.HO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charles Peirce develops a scheme for classifying different kinds of monadic,
dyadic and triadic relations. His account of these different classes of
relations figures prominently in the development of his algebraic and
diagrammatic systems of mathematical logic. Our aim in this essay is to
reconstruct and examine central features of the classificatory system that he
develops. Given the complexity of the system, we will focus our attention on
the classification and explanation of of degenerate and genuine dyadic
relations, and we will take up the discussion of triadic relations elsewhere.
One of our reasons for wanting to explore this account of relations is to
better understand how it informed the later development of relations as they
figure in the history of mathematical logic. The earlier work of Peirce on
dyadic relations influenced the development of the account of dyadic logical
relations in works of Ernst Schroder, Leopold Lowenheim, Thoralf Skolem and
Alfred Tarski. As such, our primary aim in this essay is to trace the early
development of these ideas about the formal relation of the dyad for the sake
of better understanding how it might have influenced these later developments.

from multiple sources, often contain data in various syntactic formats. Thus,
any data processing task is preceded by the critical step of data format
identification. However, manual inspection of data to identify the different
formats is infeasible in standard big-data scenarios.
  Prior techniques are restricted to a small set of pre-defined patterns (e.g.
digits, letters, words, etc.), and provide no control over granularity of
profiles. We define syntactic profiling as a problem of clustering strings
based on syntactic similarity, followed by identifying patterns that succinctly
describe each cluster. We present a technique for synthesizing such profiles
over a given language of patterns, that also allows for interactive refinement
by requesting a desired number of clusters.
  Using a state-of-the-art inductive synthesis framework, PROSE, we have
implemented our technique as FlashProfile. Across $153$ tasks over $75$ large
real datasets, we observe a median profiling time of only $\sim\,0.7\,$s.
Furthermore, we show that access to syntactic profiles may allow for more

static BS deployment density in homogeneous PPP (HPPP) models or delicately
designed location-dependent density functions in in-homogeneous PPP (IPPP)
models. However, the simultaneous existence of attractiveness and repulsiveness
among BSs practically deployed in a large-scale area defies such an assumption,
and the $\alpha$-stable distribution, one kind of heavy-tailed distributions,
has recently demonstrated superior accuracy to statistically model the varying
BS density in different areas. In this paper, we start with these new findings
and investigate the intrinsic feature (i.e., the spatial self-similarity)
embedded in the BSs. Afterwards, we refer to a generalized PPP setup with
$\alpha$-stable distributed density and theoretically derive the related
coverage probability. In particular, we give an upper bound of the derived
coverage probability for high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
thresholds and show the monotonically decreasing property of this bound with
respect to the variance of BS density. Besides, we prove that our model could
reduce to the single-tier HPPP for some special cases, and demonstrate the
superior accuracy of the $\alpha$-stable model to approach the real
environment.

probability. To understand how varying the spatial correlation between
different networks affects coverage probability, we derive special results for
the two-operator scenario, where we construct the operators' individual

validation, we devise a method to quantify and estimate spatial correlation

for the model and actual deployments not only compare very well to each other,
but also match nearly perfectly for the case of the DAS-node-dominated
deployment. Another interesting observation is that a network that shares

network of the same number of BSs that shares neither spectrum nor

applications.

data such as PIN codes, passwords, and encryption keys are then modulated,
encoded, and transmitted over the IR signals. Infiltration. In an infiltration
scenario, an attacker standing in a public area (e.g., in the street) uses IR
LEDs to transmit hidden signals to the surveillance camera(s). Binary data such
as command and control (C&C) and beacon messages are encoded on top of the IR
signals. The exfiltration and infiltration can be combined to establish
bidirectional, 'air-gap' communication between the compromised network and the
attacker. We discuss related work and provide scientific background about this
optical channel. We implement a malware prototype and present data modulation
schemas and a basic transmission protocol. Our evaluation of the covert channel
shows that data can be covertly exfiltrated from an organization at a rate of
20 bit/sec per surveillance camera to a distance of tens of meters away. Data
can be covertly infiltrated into an organization at a rate of over 100 bit/sec
per surveillance camera from a distance of hundreds of meters to kilometers
away.

by first collecting all information pertinent to a given event from the entire

finally, using a supervised learning method, to rank these representations by
the associated confidence scores. A main innovative element of our approach is
that it jointly extracts and stores all attributes of the event as a single

our supervised learning approach can achieve 25% improvement in F1-score over
baseline methods that consider the earliest, the latest or the most frequent

  Compressed Encryption","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The principle of compressed sensing (CS) can be applied in a cryptosystem by
providing the notion of security. In information-theoretic sense, it is known
that a CS-based cryptosystem can be perfectly secure if it employs a random
Gaussian sensing matrix updated at each encryption and its plaintext has
constant energy. In this paper, we propose a new CS-based cryptosystem that
employs a secret bipolar keystream and a public unitary matrix, which can be
suitable for practical implementation by generating and renewing the keystream
in a fast and efficient manner. We demonstrate that the sensing matrix is
asymptotically Gaussian for a sufficiently large plaintext length, which
guarantees a reliable CS decryption for a legitimate recipient. By means of
probability metrics, we also show that the new CS-based cryptosystem can have
the indistinguishability against an adversary, as long as the keystream is
updated at each encryption and each plaintext has constant energy. Finally, we
investigate how much the security of the new CS-based cryptosystem is sensitive
to energy variation of plaintexts.

overcome the scalability and privacy issues in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
and Ethereum by replacing expensive and slow on-chain blockchain operations
with inexpensive and fast off-chain transfers. In the form of credit networks
such as Ripple and Stellar, they also enable low-price real-time gross
settlements across different currencies. For example, SilentWhsipers is a
recently proposed fully distributed credit network relying on path-based
transactions for secure and in particular private payments without a public
ledger. At the core of a decentralized PBT network is a routing algorithm that
discovers transaction paths between payer and payee. During the last year, a
number of routing algorithms have been proposed. However, the existing ad hoc
efforts lack either efficiency or privacy. In this work, we first identify
several efficiency concerns in SilentWhsipers. Armed with this knowledge, we
design and evaluate SpeedyMurmurs, a novel routing algorithm for decentralized
PBT networks using efficient and flexible embedding-based path discovery and
on-demand efficient stabilization to handle the dynamics of a PBT network. Our
simulation study, based on real-world data from the currently deployed Ripple
credit network, indicates that SpeedyMurmurs reduces the overhead of
stabilization by up to two orders of magnitude and the overhead of routing a
transaction by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, using SpeedyMurmurs
maintains at least the same success ratio as decentralized landmark routing,
while providing lower delays. Finally, SpeedyMurmurs achieves key privacy goals
for routing in PBT networks.

of the piecewise kind, this paper provides a survey of known results
supplemented with new results for the class of piecewise linear-quadratic

linear-quadratic (PLQ) objective functions. Starting from a study of the
representation of such a function in terms of a family of elementary functions
consisting of squared affine functions, squared plus-composite-affine
functions, and affine functions themselves, we summarize some local properties
of a PLQ function in terms of their first and second-order directional
derivatives. We extend some well-known necessary and sufficient second-order
conditions for local optimality of a quadratic program to a PLQ program and
provide a dozen such equivalent conditions for strong, strict, and isolated
local optimality, showing in particular that a PLQ program has the same
characterizations for local minimality as a standard quadratic program. As a
consequence of one such condition, we show that the number of strong, strict,
or isolated local minima of a PLQ program is finite; this result supplements a
recent result about the finite number of directional stationary objective
values. Interestingly, these finiteness results can be uncovered by invoking a
very powerful property of subanalytic functions; our proof is fairly
elementary, however. We discuss applications of PLQ programs in some modern
statistical estimation problems. These problems lead to a special class of
unconstrained composite programs involving the non-differentiable
$\ell_1$-function, for which we show that the task of verifying the
second-order stationary condition can be converted to the problem of checking
the copositivity of certain Schur complement on the nonnegative orthant.

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for handling words and phrases of any length.
N-gram IDF enables us to extract key terms of any length from texts, these key
terms can be used as the features to classify bug reports. We build
classification models with logistic regression and random forest using features
from N-gram IDF and topic modeling, which is widely used in various software
engineering tasks. With a publicly available dataset, our results show that our
N-gram IDF-based models have a superior performance than the topic-based models
on all of the evaluated cases. Our models show promising results and have a
potential to be extended to other software engineering tasks.

entropy dynamics of both the TLS and the bath, and find that the dephasing rate
of the system relies on the squeezing phase of the bath. In zero temperature

two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are constructed, where the

spatial distributions among the local regions with visual attention, soft
attention based spatial Long-Short Term Memory units (LSTMs) are incorporated
to realize spatially recurrent yet visually selective over local input
patterns. All the above intuitions equip our network with the following novel
model: two-stream CNN layers, bilinear pooling layer, spatial recurrent layer
with location attention are jointly trained via an end-to-end fashion to serve
as the part detector and feature extractor, whereby relevant features are
localized and extracted attentively. We show the significance of our network

preserving privacy or matching records from different data sources. With an
increasing number of service providers nowadays routinely collecting location
traces of their users on unprecedented scales, there is a pronounced interest
in the possibility of matching records and datasets based on spatial
trajectories. Extending previous work on reidentifiability of spatial data and
trajectory matching, we present the first large-scale analysis of user
matchability in real mobility datasets on realistic scales, i.e. among two
datasets that consist of several million people's mobility traces, coming from
a mobile network operator and transportation smart card usage. We extract the
relevant statistical properties which influence the matching process and
analyze their impact on the matchability of users. We show that for individuals
with typical activity in the transportation system (those making 3-4 trips per
day on average), a matching algorithm based on the co-occurrence of their
activities is expected to achieve a 16.8% success only after a one-week long
observation of their mobility traces, and over 55% after four weeks. We show
that the main determinant of matchability is the expected number of
co-occurring records in the two datasets. Finally, we discuss different
scenarios in terms of data collection frequency and give estimates of
matchability over time. We show that with higher frequency data collection
becoming more common, we can expect much higher success rates in even shorter

classifier learners. In many problem domains, linear classifiers are preferred
over more complex models due to their efficiency, robustness and
interpretability, and the bag-of-words text representation can capture
sufficient information for linear classifiers to make highly accurate
predictions. However in settings where there is a large vocabulary, large
variance in the frequency of terms in the training corpus, many classes and
very short text (e.g., single sentences or document titles) the bag-of-words
representation becomes extremely sparse, and this can reduce the accuracy of
classifiers. A particular issue in such settings is that short texts tend to
contain infrequently occurring or rare terms which lack class-conditional
evidence. In this work we introduce a method for enriching the bag-of-words
model by complementing such rare term information with related terms from both
general and domain-specific Word Vector models. By reducing sparseness in the
bag-of-words models, our enrichment approach achieves improved classification
over several baseline classifiers in a variety of text classification problems.
Our approach is also efficient because it requires no change to the linear
classifier before or during training, since bag-of-words enrichment applies
only to text being classified.

stars. These interactions lead to a net torque that makes close-in planets
migrate inward or outward depending on their orbital distance. We compare
systematically the strength of magnetic and tidal torques for typical observed
star-planet systems (T-Tauri & hot Jupiter, M dwarf & Earth-like planet, K star
& hot Jupiter) based on state-of-the-art scaling-laws. We find that depending
on the characteristics of the system, tidal or magnetic effects can dominate.
For very close-in planets, we find that both torques can make a planet migrate
on a timescale as small as 10 to 100 thousands of years. Both effects thus have
to be taken into account when predicting the evolution of compact systems.

type, reprising its role as a structured sensing matrix in many fundamental

often contingent on proving the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain
system matrix expressible as a Khatri-Rao product of two matrices. In this
work, we analyze the RIP of a generic columnwise Khatri-Rao product matrix by
deriving two upper bounds for its $k^{\text{th}}$ order Restricted Isometry
Constant ($k$-RIC) for different values of $k$. The first RIC bound is computed
in terms of the individual RICs of the input matrices participating in the
Khatri-Rao product. The second RIC bound is probabilistic, and is specified in
terms of the input matrix dimensions. We show that the Khatri-Rao product of a
pair of $m \times n$ sized random matrices comprising independent and
identically distributed subgaussian entries satisfies $k$-RIP with arbitrarily
high probability, provided $m$ exceeds $O(k \log n)$. Our RIC bounds confirm
that the Khatri-Rao product exhibits stronger restricted isometry compared to
its constituent matrices for the same RIP order. The proposed RIC bounds are
potentially useful in the sample complexity analysis of several sparse recovery

of a similar observatory at very high altitude sites in the Andes. The science
case for such an observatory should be complementary to the science to be
performed by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. There are two clear
directions in which such an observatory could optimize its performance.
Firstly, optimize the performance of sub-TeV energies. This is especially
important to provide an unbiased monitoring of a large fraction of the sky for
observations of transient and extended sources. Secondly, to obtain the largest
photon statistics above roughly 50 TeV, which requires a large collection area
with sufficient performance in angular and energy resolution. This would enable
to extend spectral measurements of Galactic sources and gives the opportunity
to search for dark matter and exotic physics in a new energy range. Using
simulated air showers and a generalized detector description the performance of
a conceptual observatory is studied and the ways to optimize it will be
discussed. With this approach the baseline design of such an observatory can be
obtained without the need of detailed simulations of the detector hardware.

show that the time lags inherent in the election cycle will inevitable lead to

Moreover, surface states of two-dimensional materials like topological

optical modes sustained by a thin film of anisotropic materials with

It is shown that interface modes supported by such a system are hybrid in

web, are becoming popular as an online educational tool. Among various types of
screencast content, popular are the contents that involve text editing,
including computer programming. There are emerging platforms that support such
text-based screencasts by recording every character insertion/deletion from the
creator and reconstructing its playback on the viewer's screen. However, these
platforms lack rich support for creating and editing the screencast itself,
mainly due to the difficulty of manipulating recorded text changes; the changes
are tightly coupled in sequence, thus modifying arbitrary part of the sequence
is not trivial. We present a non-linear editing tool for text-based
screencasts. With the proposed selective history rewrite process, our editor
allows users to substitute an arbitrary part of a text-based screencast while
preserving overall consistency of the rest of the text-based screencast.

solve this problem and achieves considerable accuracy improvement.
Additionally, a comprehensive theoretical analysis on MIH used in MILD is
conducted to further explore the potentials of hashing methods for ANN search
of binary features from probabilistic perspective. This analysis provides more
freedom on best parameter choosing in MIH for different application scenarios.
Experiments on popular public datasets show that the proposed approach achieved

However, some of the research used unrealistic assumptions without collision
avoidance. This report focuses on the collision-free control for multiple
robots in both complete coverage and search tasks in 2D and 3D areas which are
arbitrary unknown. All algorithms are decentralized as robots have limited
abilities and they are mathematically proved.
  The report starts with the grid selection in the two tasks. Grid patterns
simplify the representation of the area and robots only need to move straightly
between neighbor vertices. For the 100% complete 2D coverage, the equilateral
triangular grid is proposed. For the complete coverage ignoring the boundary
effect, the grid with the fewest vertices is calculated in every situation for
both 2D and 3D areas.
  The second part is for the complete coverage in 2D and 3D areas. A
decentralized collision-free algorithm with the above selected grid is
presented driving robots to sections which are furthest from the reference
point. The area can be static or expanding, and the algorithm is simulated in
MATLAB.
  Thirdly, three grid-based decentralized random algorithms with collision
avoidance are provided to search targets in 2D or 3D areas. The number of
targets can be known or unknown. In the first algorithm, robots choose vacant
neighbors randomly with priorities on unvisited ones while the second one adds
the repulsive force to disperse robots if they are close. In the third
algorithm, if surrounded by visited vertices, the robot will use the
breadth-first search algorithm to go to one of the nearest unvisited vertices
via the grid. The second search algorithm is verified on Pioneer 3-DX robots.
The general way to generate the formula to estimate the search time is
demonstrated. Algorithms are compared with five other algorithms in MATLAB to
show their effectiveness.

optimization programs is key in many applications, from control systems to
signal processing and machine learning. In this context, solving means to find
and track the optimizer trajectory of the continuously-varying convex
optimization program. Recently, a novel prediction-correction methodology has
been put forward to set up iterative algorithms that sample the
continuously-varying optimization program at discrete time steps and perform a
limited amount of computations to correct their approximate optimizer with the
new sampled problem and predict how the optimizer will change at the next time
step. Prediction-correction algorithms have been shown to outperform more
classical strategies, i.e., correction-only methods. Typically,
prediction-correction methods have asymptotic tracking errors of the order of
$h^2$, where $h$ is the sampling period, whereas classical strategies have
order of $h$. Up to now, Prediction-correction algorithms have been developed
in the primal space, both for unconstrained and simply constrained convex
programs. In this paper, we show how to tackle linearly constrained
continuously-varying problem by prediction-correction in the dual space and we
prove similar asymptotic error bounds as their primal versions.

Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime filled with perfect fluid. The
classical model is formulated canonically. The Hamiltonian constraint is
de-parametrised by setting a fluid variable as the internal clock. The obtained
reduced (i.e. physical) phase space is then quantised. Our quantisation
procedure is implemented in accordance with two different phase space
symmetries, namely, the Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry for the perturbation
variables, and the affine symmetry for the background variables. As an
appealing outcome, the initial singularity is removed and replaced with a
quantum bounce. The quantum model depends on a free parameter that is naturally
induced from quantisation and determines the scale of the bounce. We study the
dynamics of the quantised gravitational waves across the bounce through three
different methods (""thin-horizon"", analytical and numerical) which give
consistent results and we determine the primordial power spectrum for the case
of radiation-dominated universe. Next, we use the instantaneous
radiation-matter transition transfer function to make approximate predictions
for late universe and constrain our model with LIGO and Planck data. We also
give an estimate of the quantum uncertainties in the present-day universe.

are expressed in terms of a pair of projections introduced by Avron, Seiler,

determined by the spectrum of the difference between the two projections. This
difference exhibits remarkable and useful properties, as it is compact and has
a supersymmetric structure in the spectrum. These properties make it possible
to numerically determine the indices of disordered topological insulators
highly efficiently. The method is demonstrated for the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang

studied for magnetodielectricity. The substitution causes a substantial
decrease in the Neel temperature (T_N) from 250 K (in parent sample, BFO) to
152 K (in 2% Co substituted sample). At the same time, the substituted samples
display a pronounced irreversibility in the ZFC-FC magnetization data for T $<$
370 K and opening of hysteresis in the M-H plot, thus signifying the onset of
weak ferromagnetism (FM) and magnetic glassiness. The induced magnetic
glassiness is found to slow down the dynamics such that the magnetization decay
follows. The dielectric measurement in the same temperature window shows
unusual oppression in, for T$\sim$T_N and contrasting nature of tan loss for
temperatures above and below T_N, thus hinting a plausible coupling between the
magnetic and electric order parameters. A confirmation to this coupling is seen
in the magnetodielectric (MD) results, in which it is found that the
substitution induces an additional component in the MD, apart from the usual
components in BFO. This additional component of MD is found to obey behaviour,
with the n values being comparable to 1-p of magnetization. The temperature
variation of MD also shows a contrasting behaviour for the parent and 2% Co
substituted sample with an enhancement of two times in MD value. In summary,
our study shows ME coupling introduced by the magnetic glassiness and its
behaviour is very much different from the intrinsic one.

fractured porous media for underground processes. We focus our attention on
domains where the presence of faults, with thickness several orders of
magnitude smaller than other characteristic sizes, can allow one part of the
domain to slide past to the other. We propose a mathematical scheme where a
reduced model for the fault flows is employed yielding a problem of
co-dimension one. The hybrid finite volume method is used to obtain the
discretized problem, which employs two different meshes for each fault, one
associated with the porous-medium domain on each side of the fault. These two
meshes can move with the corresponding domain, resulting in non-matching grids
between the two parts of the fault. In an earlier paper a mathematical scheme
was proposed where the numerical discretization considers the hybrid finite
volume method. In this paper we focus on the well-posedness of the continuous
problem, the convergence of the discretized problem, and with several numerical

linear perturbation of current sheets. The resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
operator for a background field consisting of a current sheet is non-normal,
meaning that associated eigenvalues and eigenmodes can be very sensitive to
perturbation. In a linear stability analysis of a tearing current sheet, we
show that modes that are damped as $t\rightarrow\infty$ can produce transient
energy growth, contributing faster growth rates and higher energy attainment
(within a fixed finite time) than the unstable tearing mode found from
normal-mode analysis. We determine the transient growth for tearing-stable and
tearing-unstable regimes and discuss the consequences of our results for
processes in the solar atmosphere, such as flares and coronal heating. Our
results have significant potential impact on how fast current sheets can be
disrupted. In particular, transient energy growth due to (asymptotically)
damped modes may lead to accelerated current sheet thinning and, hence, a
faster onset of the plasmoid instability, compared to the rate determined by
the tearing mode alone.

perturbed learning automata) and provides a stochastic-stability analysis in
repeatedly-played, positive-utility, finite strategic-form games. Prior work in
this class of learning dynamics primarily analyzes asymptotic convergence
through stochastic approximations, where convergence can be associated with the
limit points of an ordinary-differential equation (ODE). However, analyzing
global convergence through an ODE-approximation requires the existence of a
Lyapunov or a potential function, which naturally restricts the analysis to a
fine class of games. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an
alternative framework for analyzing asymptotic convergence that is based upon
an explicit characterization of the invariant probability measure of the
induced Markov chain. We further provide a methodology for computing the
invariant probability measure in positive-utility games, together with an
illustration in the context of coordination games.

interactions may be significantly larger than the coupling to transverse

enables us to include the inter-dipole Coulomb energy within the system
Hamiltonian rather than the interaction. In contrast, the standard master
equation for a two- dipole system, which depends entirely on well-known
gauge-invariant S-matrix elements, is usually derived using the multipolar
gauge, wherein there is no explicit inter-dipole Coulomb interaction. We show
using a generalised arbitrary-gauge light-matter Hamiltonian that this master
equation is obtained in other gauges only if the inter-dipole Coulomb
interaction is kept within the interaction Hamiltonian rather than the
unperturbed part as in our derivation. Thus, our master equation, while still
gauge-invariant, depends on different S-matrix elements, which give
separation-dependent corrections to the standard matrix elements describing
resonant energy transfer and collective decay. The two master equations
coincide in the large separation limit where static couplings are negligible.
We provide an application of our master equation by finding
separation-dependent corrections to the natural emission spectrum of the
two-dipole system.

  interaction","11 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In various areas of science, technology, environment protection,
construction, it is very important to study processes of porous materials
interaction with different substances in different aggregation states. From the
point of view of ecology and environmental protection it is particularly actual
to investigate processes of porous materials interaction with water in liquid
and gaseous phases. Since one mole of water contains $6,022140857\cdot 10^{23}$
molecules of $\mathtt{H_2O}$, macroscopic approaches considering the water
vapor as continuum media in the framework of classical aerodynamics are mainly
used to describe properties, for example properties of water vapor in the pore.
In this paper we construct and use for simulation the macroscopic
two-dimensional diffusion model describing the behavior of water vapor inside
the isolated pore. Together with the macroscopic model it is proposed
microscopic model of the behavior of water vapor inside the isolated pores.
This microscopic model is built within the molecular dynamics approach. In the
microscopic model a description of each water molecule motion is based on
Newton classical mechanics considering interactions with other molecules and
pore walls. Time evolution of water vapor - pore system is explored. Depending
on the external to the pore conditions the system evolves to various states of
equilibrium, characterized by different values of the macroscopic
characteristics such as temperature, density, pressure. Comparisons of results
of molecular dynamic simulations with the results of calculations based on the
macroscopic diffusion model and experimental data allow to conclude that the
combination of macroscopic and microscopic approach could produce more adequate
and more accurate description of processes of water vapor interaction with
porous materials.

will have a significant impact on millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications
systems that employ electrically-steerable and narrow beamwidth antenna arrays.
A peer-to-peer (P2P) measurement campaign was conducted with 7-degree,
15-degree, and 60-degree half-power beamwidth (HPBW) antenna pairs at 73.5 GHz
and with 1 GHz of RF null-to-null bandwidth in a heavily populated open square
scenario in Brooklyn, New York, to study blockage events caused by typical
pedestrian traffic. Antenna beamwidths that range approximately an order of
magnitude were selected to gain knowledge of fading events for antennas with
different beamwidths since antenna patterns for mmWave systems will be
electronically-adjustable. Two simple modeling approaches in the literature are
introduced to characterize the blockage events by either a two-state Markov
model or a four-state piecewise linear modeling approach. Transition
probability rates are determined from the measurements and it is shown that
average fade durations with a -5 dB threshold are 299.0 ms for 7-degree HPBW
antennas and 260.2 ms for 60-degree HPBW antennas. The four-state piecewise
linear modeling approach shows that signal strength decay and rise times are
asymmetric for blockage events and that mean signal attenuations (average fade
depths) are inversely proportional to antenna HPBW, where 7-degree and
60-degree HPBW antennas resulted in mean signal fades of 15.8 dB and 11.5 dB,
respectively. The models presented herein are valuable for extending
statistical channel models at mmWave to accurately simulate real-world
pedestrian blockage events when designing fifth-generation (5G) wireless

the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the posterior distribution to the

penalizes also the covariance. Then we develop an efficient alternating

1.0""x0.7""(50-70pc). We have developed a set of time-dependent chemical models
to determine the origin of the C2H gas. A sizeable fraction of the total C2H
line emission is detected from the r~1.3kpc starburst (SB) ring. However, the
brightest C2H emission originates from a r~200pc off-centered circumnuclear
disk (CND), where evidence of a molecular outflow has been previously found in
other molecular tracers imaged by ALMA. We also detect significant emission
that connects the CND with the outer disk. We derived the fractional abundances
of C2H (X(C2H)) assuming LTE conditions. Our estimates range from X(C2H)~a few
10^-8 in the SB ring up to X(C2H)~ a few 10^-7 in the outflow region. PDR
models that incorporate gas-grain chemistry are able to account for X(C2H) in
the SB ring for moderately dense (n(H2)>10^4 cm^-3) and moderately
UV-irradiated gas (UV-field<10xDraine field) in a steady-state regime. However,
the high fractional abundances estimated for C2H in the outflow region can only
be reached at very early times (T< 10^2-10^3 yr) in models of UV/X-ray
irradiated dense gas (n(H2)>10^4-10^5) cm^-3). We interpret that the transient
conditions required to fit the high values of X(C2H) in the outflow are likely
due to UV/X-ray irradiated non-dissociative shocks associated with the highly
turbulent interface between the outflow and the molecular gas in NGC1068.

Studies in the recent few years have shown that alloying of BiFeO3 with BaTiO3,

encouraging from the view point of technological applications, the origin of

powders sampled from the entire specimen. We also demonstrate that inspite of

value which is comparable to what has been reported for layered
ferroelectric/ferromagnetic laminates and bilayer thin film

large magnetoelectric coupling is realizable in simple 0-3

developed which induces spontaneous precipitation of the ferromagnetic phase in
small volume fraction to ensure good insulating behaviour of the composite thus
developed.

closely related to the energy distribution of electrons, which is further

the evolution of the electron distribution with given initial parameters, in
which three cooling processes (i.e., adiabatic, synchrotron and inverse Compton
cooling) and the effect of decaying magnetic field are coherently considered. A
sequence of results are presented by exploring the plausible parameter space
for both the fireball and the Poynting-flux-dominated regime. Different cooling
patterns for the electrons can be identified and they are featured by a
specific dominant cooling mechanism. Our results show that the hardening of the
low-energy spectra can be attributed to the dominance of synchrotron
self-Compton cooling within the internal shock model, or to decaying
synchrotron cooling within the Poynting-flux-dominated jet scenario. These two
mechanisms can be distinguished by observing the hard low-energy spectra of
isolated short pulses in some GRBs. The dominance of adiabatic cooling can also
lead to hard low-energy spectra when the ejecta is moving at an extreme
relativistic speed. The information from the time-resolved low-energy spectra
can help to probe the physical characteristics of the GRB ejecta via our
numerical results.

investigate the difference for railgun operation in between a capacitor and a

steps including local feature extraction, codebook generation, and feature
quantization, etc. Those steps are relatively independent with each other and
are hard to be jointly optimized. Moreover, the dependency on hand-crafted
local feature makes BoWs model not effective in conveying high-level semantics.
These issues largely hinder the performance of BoWs model in large-scale image
applications. To conquer these issues, we propose an End-to-End BoWs
(E$^2$BoWs) model based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Our model
takes an image as input, then identifies and separates the semantic objects in
it, and finally outputs the visual words with high semantic discriminative
power. Specifically, our model firstly generates Semantic Feature Maps (SFMs)
corresponding to different object categories through convolutional layers, then
introduces Bag-of-Words Layers (BoWL) to generate visual words for each
individual feature map. We also introduce a novel learning algorithm to
reinforce the sparsity of the generated E$^2$BoWs model, which further ensures
the time and memory efficiency. We evaluate the proposed E$^2$BoWs model on
several image search datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MIRFLICKR-25K and
NUS-WIDE. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising accuracy

time that the flow of water media from the interface between chemically
nanopatterned hydrophobic surfaces and adjacent hydrophilic regions (a Janus
interface) can effectively be employed for rapid nanoparticle assembly with
single nanoparticle resolution. We find that the dewetting of water molecules
from this Janus interface drives the assembly of nanoparticles from
electrostatically stabilised nanoparticle colloids onto the hydrophobic areas,
expedited by removing the resistance to adhesion between wetted interfaces
exerted by any hydration barrier, such that nanoparticle assembly is achieved
in under a minute. We call this method of controlled nanoparticle assembly
Janus Interface Nanoparticle Assembly - JINA. We then demonstrate control of
this mechanism through pH switching and prove its effectiveness for fabrication
by rapidly creating single-nanoparticle sites and single particle wide lines
whilst simultaneously densely coating macro-scale features. Not only does this
assembly method have far-reaching implications in nanomanufacturing, the

labeling data is costly and requires a huge amount of work. In this paper, we
thus address the problem of learning with very few labels. The aim is to
recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information
which is of interest to cyclists. We propose a system for object recognition
that is trained with only 15 examples per class on average. To achieve this, we
combine the advantages of convolutional neural networks and random forests to
learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, we map the random forest to a
neural network and transform the classifier to a fully convolutional network.
Thereby, the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and
bounding boxes can be predicted. Finally, we integrate data of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) to localize the predictions on the map. In comparison
to Faster R-CNN and other networks for object recognition or algorithms for
transfer learning, we considerably reduce the required amount of labeled data.

solar wind energy flux exhibits more significant long-term variations. However,
its link to the global climate change is rarely concerned and remain a mystery.
As a fundamental and important aspect of the Earth's weather and climate
system, tropical cyclone activity has been causing more and more attentions.
Here we investigate the possible modulation of the total energy flux input from
the solar wind into the Earth's magnetosphere on the global tropical cyclone
activity during 1963--2012. From a global perspective, the accumulated cyclone
energy increases gradually since 1963 and start to decrease after 1994. Compare
to the previously frequently used parameters, e,g., the sunspot number, the
total solar irradiation, the solar F10.7 irradiation, the tropical sea surface
temperature, and the south oscillation index, the total solar wind energy flux
input exhibits a better correlation with the global tropical cyclone activity.
Furthermore, the tropical cyclones seem to be more intense with higher
geomagnetic activities. A plausible modulation mechanism is thus proposed to
link the terrestrial weather phenomenon to the seemly-unrelated solar wind
energy input.

found that in spite of the reduced spontaneous lattice strain, the polarization
of the Ca-modified variant is higher. We, therefore, demonstrate that the very
large piezoelectric response of (Ba, Ca)(Ti, Sn)O3 is associated with the
decoupling of the polarization and lattice strain by Ca-modification.

performance compared to other approaches, with YOLOv2 (an improved You Only

detection methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Although YOLOv2 can
achieve real-time performance on a powerful GPU, it still remains very

limited memory. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Fast YOLO, a
fast You Only Look Once framework which accelerates YOLOv2 to be able to
perform object detection in video on embedded devices in a real-time manner.
First, we leverage the evolutionary deep intelligence framework to evolve the
YOLOv2 network architecture and produce an optimized architecture (referred to
as O-YOLOv2 here) that has 2.8X fewer parameters with just a ~2% IOU drop. To
further reduce power consumption on embedded devices while maintaining
performance, a motion-adaptive inference method is introduced into the proposed
Fast YOLO framework to reduce the frequency of deep inference with O-YOLOv2
based on temporal motion characteristics. Experimental results show that the
proposed Fast YOLO framework can reduce the number of deep inferences by an
average of 38.13%, and an average speedup of ~3.3X for objection detection in
video compared to the original YOLOv2, leading Fast YOLO to run an average of
~18FPS on a Nvidia Jetson TX1 embedded system.

demonstrate this key Majorana diagnostics, we study the spin composition of
magnetic impurity induced in-gap Shiba states in a superconductor using a
quantum impurity model (at the mean-field level). By examining the spin and
spectral densities in the context of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)
particle-hole symmetry, we derive a sum rule that relates the spin densities of
localized Shiba states with those in the normal state without
superconductivity. Extending our investigations to ferromagnetic chain of
magnetic impurities, we identify key features of the spin properties of the
extended Shiba state bands, as well as those associated with a localized
Majorana end mode when the effect of spin-orbit interaction is included. We
then formulate a phenomenological theory for the measurement of the local spin
densities with spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques.
By combining the calculated spin densities and the measurement theory, we show
that spin-polarized STM measurements can reveal a sharp contrast in spin
polarization between an accidentally-zero-energy trivial Shiba state and a
Majorana zero mode in a topological superconducting phase in atomic chains. We
further confirm our results with numerical simulations that address generic

looking at time-series of such measures, patterns that repeat at regular

certain source-target pairs it happens to observe that the paths follow
alternations that repeat several times. Have they the features of periodicity?
What are their main characteristics? In this paper we study the problem of

show that a surprisingly high percentage of measures present one or more
periodicities. This happens both with traceroutes performed at different
frequencies and with different types of traceroutes. Third, we apply our
algorithm to databases of BGP updates, a context where periodicities are even
more unexpected than the one of traceroutes. Also in this case our algorithm is
able to spot periodicities. We argue that some of them are related to
oscillations of the BGP control plane.

lead to a reproductive isolation event. In this paper, a haploid population
living on two patches linked by migration is considered. Individuals are
ecologically and demographically neutral on the space and differ only on a

special feature of this paper is to assume that the strengths of the mating
preference and the migration depend on the trait carried. Indeed, patterns of
mating preferences are generally asymmetrical between the subspecies of a
population. I prove that mating preference interacting with frequency-dependent
migration behavior can lead to a reproductive isolation. Then, I describe the
time before reproductive isolation occurs. To reach this result, I use an
original method to study the limiting dynamical system, analyzing first the
system without migration and adding migration with a perturbation method.
Finally, I study how the time before reproductive isolation is influenced by
the parameters of migration and of mating preferences, highlighting that large
migration rates tend to favor types with weak mating preferences.

interpret observations. The optical total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv =
Av/E(B-V), is widely used to describe extinction variations in ultraviolet and
optical bands. Since the Rv=3.1 extinction curve adequately represents the
average extinction law of diffuse regions in the Milky Way, it is commonly used
to correct observational measurements along sightlines toward diffuse regions
in the interstellar medium. However, the Rv value may vary even along different
diffuse interstellar medium sightlines. In this paper, we investigate the
optical--mid-infrared (mid-IR) extinction law toward a very diffuse region at l
= 165 in the Galactic plane, which was selected based on a CO emission map.
Adopting red clump stars as extinction tracers, we determine the
optical-to-mid-IR extinction law for our diffuse region in the two APASS bands
(B, V), the three XSTPS-GAC bands (g, r, i), the three 2MASS bands (J, H, Ks,
and the two WISE bands (W1, W2). Specifically, 18 red clump stars were selected
from the APOGEE--RC catalog based on spectroscopic data in order to explore the
diversity of the extinction law. We find that the optical extinction curves
exhibit appreciable diversity. The corresponding Rv ranges from 1.7 to 3.8,
while the mean Rv value of 2.8 is consistent with the widely adopted average
value of 3.1 for Galactic diffuse clouds. There is no apparent correlation
between Rv value and color excess E(B-V) in the range of interest, from 0.2 to
0.6 mag, or with specific visual extinction per kiloparsec, AV/d.

Learning a policy for a group of agents is difficult due to distributed partial
observability of the state. Here, we follow a guided approach where a critic
has central access to the global state during learning, which simplifies the
policy evaluation problem from a reinforcement learning point of view. For
example, we can get the positions of all robots of the swarm using a camera
image of a scene. This camera image is only available to the critic and not to
the control policies of the robots. We follow an actor-critic approach, where
the actors base their decisions only on locally sensed information. In
contrast, the critic is learned based on the true global state. Our algorithm
uses deep reinforcement learning to approximate both the Q-function and the
policy. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on two tasks with simple
simulated 2D agents: 1) finding and maintaining a certain distance to each

four dimensions depends on the choice of Lagrangian formulation. One important
goal is to get the most general deformations without making hidden assumptions.
Ignoring supersymmetry we consider in this paper $n_v$ abelian vector
potentials in four spacetime dimensions with non-minimal kinetic coupling to
$n_s$ uncharged (possibly nonlinear) scalar fields. As in the case of extended
supergravities, one model may possess different formulations related by
$Sp(2n_v,\mathbb{R})$. The symplectic group mixes its electric and magnetic
potentials. The model admits a global duality symmetry subgroup $G$ which acts
also on the scalars. We recall first how the general second order Lagrangian,
its local deformations and those of its abelian gauge group will depend on the
choice of $2n_v$ directions (choice of ""Darboux frame""). We start from a
general frame defined by the symplectic transformation relating it to a
fixed""reference"" one. Combinations of symplectic matrix coefficients appear
then as constant parameters in the second order Lagrangians. Another gauging
method uses an ""embedding tensor"" that characterizes the realization of the
gauge group via the global duality group. It involves additional 2-form gauge
fields. A suitable zero charge limit of this realization has abelian gauge
group and the ""gauging"" can be viewed as a consistent deformation of that
limit. We show that the two methods applied to the corresponding ungauged
models have equivalent local deformations -- and more generally, have
isomorphic local BRST cohomology at all ghost numbers. We finally consider
manifestly duality invariant first order actions with abelian gauge group. We
point out that obstructions to non-abelian deformations of the Yang-Mills type
exhibited in a previous work remain present when couplings to scalar fields are
included.

varied test data is needed for effective testing and to achieve different types

measure and thus, implicitly, to create diverse data have also been proposed.
However, if the tester is able to identify features of the test data that are
important for the particular domain or context in which the testing is being
performed, the use of generic diversity measures such as this may not be
sufficient nor efficient for creating test inputs that show diversity in terms
of these features. Here we investigate different approaches to find data that
are diverse according to a specific set of features, such as length, depth of
recursion etc. Even though these features will be less general than measures
based on information theory, their use may provide a tester with more direct
control over the type of diversity that is present in the test data. Our
experiments are carried out in the context of a general test data generation
framework that can generate both numerical and highly structured data. We
compare random sampling for feature-diversity to different approaches based on
search and find a hill climbing search to be efficient. The experiments
highlight many trade-offs that needs to be taken into account when searching
for diversity. We argue that recurrent test data generation motivates building
statistical models that can then help to more quickly achieve feature

previous ones and with those compiled in the ICRU-49 report. They are fully
consistent with the predictions of Sigmund-Schinner's binary collision theory
of electronic stopping over the whole proton energy range explored. An average
deviation of ~2.5% relative to values calculated by the SRIM-2008 code, likely
due to effects of valence electrons involving the , and bonds, is however
observed at low proton velocities. The measured energy loss straggling data,
which are unique to our knowledge, are found to be in good agreement with
values derived by the classical Bohr formula for keV but they significantly
exceed Bohr's collisional energy loss straggling at lower proton velocities
where target electrons can no longer be considered as free. They also show to
be consistent with the predictions of the Bethe-Livingston and Sigmund-Schinner
theories over the low proton velocity region ( keV). However, they are
significantly overestimated by these theories over the intermediate and high
proton velocity regions, which may be due to bunching effect by inner shell
electrons of the polymer target. Besides, our energy loss straggling data are
in better overall consistency with the Yang, O'Connor and Wang empirical
formula for keV, while deviations above the latter amounting up to ~18% are

meta-heuristic algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization, which uses
independent algorithm executions. The new procedure consists of either adding
new executions or extending along time the existing ones. This is done on the
basis of a criterion that uses a surrogate of the algorithm failure
probability, where the optimal solution is replaced by the best so far one.
Therefore, it can be applied in practice. We prove that, with probability one,
the restart time of the proposed procedure approaches, as the number of
iterations diverges, the optimal value that minimizes the expected time to find
the solution. We apply the proposed restart procedure to several Traveling
Salesman Problem instances with hundreds or thousands of cities. As basic
algorithm, we used different versions of an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.
We compare the results from the restart procedure with those from the basic
algorithm. This is done by considering the failure probability of the two
approaches for equal computation cost. This comparison showed a significant
gain when applying the proposed restart procedure, whose failure probability is
several orders of magnitude lower.

  Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence","14 pages",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1981",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In our conventional understanding, large-scale magnetic fields are thought to
originate from an inverse cascade in the presence of magnetic helicity,
differential rotation, or a magneto-rotational instability. However, as recent
simulations have given strong indications that an inverse cascade (transfer)
may occur even in the absence of magnetic helicity, the physical origin of this
inverse cascade is still not fully understood. We here present two simulations
of freely decaying helical \& non-helical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.
We verified the inverse transfer of helical and non-helical magnetic fields in
both cases, but we found the underlying physical principles to be fundamentally
different. In the former case, the helical magnetic component leads to an
inverse cascade of magnetic energy. We derived a semi analytic formula for the
evolution of large scale magnetic field using $\alpha$ coefficient and compared
it with the simulation data. But in the latter case, the $\alpha$ effect,
including other conventional dynamo theories, are not suitable to describe the
inverse transfer of non-helical magnetic. To obtain a better understanding of
the physics at work here, we introduced a `field structure model' based on the
magnetic induction equation in the presence of inhomogeneities. This model
illustrates how the curl of the electromotiveforce (EMF) leads to the build up
of a large-scale magnetic field without the requirement of magnetic helicity.
And we applied a Quasi Normal approximation to the inverse transfer of magnetic
energy.

Our results do not confirm CO2 as a primary carrier gas for trace gases in all

K\""arlich are directly linked via a continuous tectonic fault in an ENE-WSW
trending direction. There is also evidence that Kaerlich and Kobern (NNE-SSW
fault system) and Nette and Kobern (NW-SE fault system) are tectonically
linked. These fault linkages are unknown previously but could be related to the
rising numbers of earthquake events occurring in this area since 2010. We did
not find any evidence that weather processes (e.g., barometric pressure), earth
tides, or low local earthquake magnitudes actively modulate degassing. The
volcanic activity in the EEVF is dormant but not extinct and to understand and
monitor its magmatic and degassing systems, we recommend bi-weekly samplings at
