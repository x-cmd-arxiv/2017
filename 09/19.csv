($\mu$-Bose gas model), its thermodynamical aspects e.g. total number of
particles and the partition function are certain functions of the parameter
$\mu$. This basic $\mu$-dependence of thermodynamics of the $\mu$-Bose gas
arises through the so-called $\mu$-calculus, an alternative to the known
$q$-calculus (Jackson derivative, etc.), so we include main elements of
$\mu$-calculus. Likewise, virial expansion of EOS and virial coefficients, the
internal energy, specific heat and the entropy of $\mu$-Bose gas show
$\mu$-dependence. Herein, we study thermodynamical geometry of $\mu$-Bose gas
model and find the singular behavior of (scalar) curvature, signaling for
Bose-like condensation. The critical temperature of condensation $T^{(\mu)}_c$
depending on $\mu$ is given and compared with the usual $T_c$, and with known
$T_c^{(p,q)}$ of $p,q$-Bose gas model. Using the results on
$\mu$-thermodynamics we argue that the condensate of $\mu$-Bose gas, like the
earlier proposed infinite statistics system of particles, can serve for
effective modeling of dark matter.

  Region of Ellipses in the Plane",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel technique for tight outer-approximation of the
intersection region of a finite number of ellipses in 2-dimensional (2D) space
is proposed. First, the vertices of a tight polygon that contains the convex
intersection of the ellipses are found in an efficient manner. To do so, the
intersection points of the ellipses that fall on the boundary of the
intersection region are determined, and a set of points is generated on the
elliptic arcs connecting every two neighbouring intersection points. By finding
the tangent lines to the ellipses at the extended set of points, a set of
half-planes is obtained, whose intersection forms a polygon. To find the
polygon more efficiently, the points are given an order and the intersection of
the half-planes corresponding to every two neighbouring points is calculated.
If the polygon is convex and bounded, these calculated points together with the
initially obtained intersection points will form its vertices. If the polygon
is non-convex or unbounded, we can detect this situation and then generate
additional discrete points only on the elliptical arc segment causing the
issue, and restart the algorithm to obtain a bounded and convex polygon.
Finally, the smallest area ellipse that contains the vertices of the polygon is
obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Through numerical
experiments, it is illustrated that the proposed technique returns a tighter
outer-approximation of the intersection of multiple ellipses, compared to
conventional techniques, with only slightly higher computational cost.

state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, real-world adoption of these
networks is impeded by hardware and speed constraints. Conventional model
compression methods attempt to address this problem by modifying the
architecture manually or using pre-defined heuristics. Since the space of all
reduced architectures is very large, modifying the architecture of a deep
neural network in this way is a difficult task. In this paper, we tackle this
issue by introducing a principled method for learning reduced network
architectures in a data-driven way using reinforcement learning. Our approach
takes a larger `teacher' network as input and outputs a compressed `student'
network derived from the `teacher' network. In the first stage of our method, a
recurrent policy network aggressively removes layers from the large `teacher'
model. In the second stage, another recurrent policy network carefully reduces
the size of each remaining layer. The resulting network is then evaluated to
obtain a reward -- a score based on the accuracy and compression of the
network. Our approach uses this reward signal with policy gradients to train
the policies to find a locally optimal student network. Our experiments show
that we can achieve compression rates of more than 10x for models such as
ResNet-34 while maintaining similar performance to the input `teacher' network.
We also present a valuable transfer learning result which shows that policies
which are pre-trained on smaller `teacher' networks can be used to rapidly
speed up training on larger `teacher' networks.

resonance plays an important role in the asteroid collision rate with the
Earth. Compared to exoplanetary systems, the solar system is somewhat special
in its lack of a super-Earth mass planet in the inner solar system. We
therefore first consider the effects of the presence of a super-Earth in the
terrestrial planet region. We find a significant effect for super-Earths with a
mass of around $10\,\rm M_\oplus$ and a separation greater than about $0.7\,\rm
AU$. For a super-Earth that is interior to the Earth's orbit, the number of
asteroids colliding with Earth increases the closer the super-Earth is to the
Earth's orbit. This is the result of multiple secular resonance locations
causing more asteroids to be perturbed onto Earth-crossing orbits. When the
super-Earth is placed exterior to Earth's orbit, the collision rate decreases
substantially because the $\nu_6$ resonance no longer exists in the asteroid
belt region. We also find that changing the semi-major axis of Saturn leads to
a significant decrease in the asteroid collision rate, while increasing its
mass increases the collision rate. These results may have implications for the
habitability of exoplanetary systems.

vehicle detections across multiple WAMI frames to form tracks corresponding to
individual vehicles. The temporal window length, i.e., the number $M$ of
sequential frames, over which associations are collectively estimated poses a
trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. A larger $M$ improves
performance because the increased temporal context enables the use of motion
models and allows occlusions and spurious detections to be handled better. The
number of total hypotheses tracks, on the other hand, grows exponentially with
increasing $M$, making larger values of $M$ computationally challenging to
tackle. In this paper, we introduce SPAAM an iterative approach that
progressively grows $M$ with each iteration to improve estimated tracks by
exploiting the enlarged temporal context while keeping computation manageable
through two novel approaches for pruning association hypotheses. First, guided
by a road network, accurately co-registered to the WAMI frames, we disregard
unlikely associations that do not agree with the road network. Second, as $M$
is progressively enlarged at each iteration, the related increase in
association hypotheses is limited by revisiting only the subset of association
possibilities rendered open by stochastically determined dis-associations for
the previous iteration. The stochastic dis-association at each iteration
maintains each estimated association according to an estimated probability for
confidence, obtained via a probabilistic model. Associations at each iteration
are then estimated globally over the $M$ frames by (approximately) solving a
binary integer programming problem for selecting a set of compatible tracks.
Vehicle tracking results obtained over test WAMI datasets indicate that our
proposed approach provides significant performance improvements over 3
alternatives.

their local decodability and (tolerant) local testability. While these aspects
have been studied extensively when $A_1 = \cdots = A_n = \mathbb{F}_q$ are the
same finite field, the setting when $A_i$'s are not the full field does not
seem to have been explored before.
  In this work we focus on the case $A_i = \{0,1\}$ for every $i$. We show that
for every field (finite or otherwise) there is a test whose query complexity
depends only on the degree (and not on the number of variables). In contrast we
show that decodability is possible over fields of positive characteristic (with
query complexity growing with the degree of the polynomial and the
characteristic), but not over the reals, where the query complexity must grow
with $n$. As a consequence we get a natural example of a code (one with a
transitive group of symmetries) that is locally testable but not locally
decodable.
  Classical results on local decoding and testing of polynomials have relied on
the 2-transitive symmetries of the space of low-degree polynomials (under
affine transformations). Grids do not possess this symmetry: So we introduce
some new techniques to overcome this handicap and in particular use the
hypercontractivity of the (constant weight) noise operator on the Hamming cube.

avoids graphene edge tailors required by previous proposals. More importantly,
we find clear significant of a spin selectivity and a region tunability in the
spin-dependent NDR: by changing the top gates of the device, NDR for spin up
only, spin down only, or both spins (occurring sequentially) can be
respectively realized; meanwhile, the central position of the NDR region in
each case can be monotonously tuned in a wide range of bias voltage. These
remarkable features are attributed to a gate controllability of the
spin-dependent resonant levels in the device hence their deviations from the
Fermi energy and Dirac point in the source electrode, respectively. They add a
spin and a bias degree of freedom to conventional NDR-based devices, which
paves a way for designing a whole new class of NDR circuits.

a Steiner triple system on $2^n-1$ points is at least $2^n -1 -n$, and equality
holds only for the classical point-line design in the projective geometry
$PG(n-1,2)$. It follows from results of Assmus \cite{A} that, given any integer
$t$ with $1 \leq t \leq n-1$, there is a code $C_{n,t}$ containing
representatives of all isomorphism classes of STS$(2^n-1)$ with 2-rank at most
$2^n -1 -n + t$. Using a mixture of coding theoretic, geometric, design
theoretic and combinatorial arguments, we prove a general formula for the
number of distinct STS$(2^n-1)$ with 2-rank at most $2^n -1 -n + t$ contained
in this code. This generalizes the only previously known cases, $t=1$, proved
by Tonchev \cite{T01} in 2001, $t=2$, proved by V. Zinoviev and D. Zinoviev

study of the ternary block codes of Steiner triple systems \cite{JT}, we obtain

can be hard to tune in higher dimensions. It is typical to use simulation to
learn these parameters, but controllers learned in simulation often don't
transfer to hardware. This necessitates optimization directly on hardware.
However, collecting data on hardware can be expensive. This has led to a recent
interest in adapting data-efficient learning techniques to robotics. One
popular method is Bayesian Optimization (BO), a sample-efficient black-box
optimization scheme, but its performance typically degrades in higher
dimensions. We aim to overcome this problem by incorporating domain knowledge
to reduce dimensionality in a meaningful way, with a focus on bipedal
locomotion. In previous work, we proposed a transformation based on knowledge
of human walking that projected a 16-dimensional controller to a 1-dimensional
space. In simulation, this showed enhanced sample efficiency when optimizing
human-inspired neuromuscular walking controllers on a humanoid model. In this
paper, we present a generalized feature transform applicable to non-humanoid
robot morphologies and evaluate it on the ATRIAS bipedal robot -- in simulation
and on hardware. We present three different walking controllers; two are
evaluated on the real robot. Our results show that this feature transform
captures important aspects of walking and accelerates learning on hardware and
simulation, as compared to traditional BO.

intersecting the imaginary axis, indicating the existence of smooth peaks in
the return rate preceding the cusps. Additionally, we discuss in detail the

method relies on a systematic classification of renormalisable single-mediator
models for dark matter-quark interactions, and is valid for dark matter
candidates of spin less than or equal to one. Applying our method to simulated
data, we find that at the end of the LHC Run 3 only two mutually exclusive
scenarios would be compatible with the detection of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ signal
events at XENONnT. In a first scenario, the energy distribution of the signal
events is featureless, as for canonical spin-independent interactions. In this
case, if a mono-jet signal is detected at the LHC, dark matter must have spin
1/2 and interact with nucleons through a unique velocity-dependent operator. If
a mono-jet signal is not detected, dark matter interacts with nucleons through
canonical spin-independent interactions. In a second scenario, the spectral
distribution of the signal events exhibits a bump at non zero recoil energies.
In this second case, a mono-jet signal can be detected at the LHC Run 3, dark
matter must have spin 1/2 and interact with nucleons through a unique
momentum-dependent operator. We therefore conclude that the observation of
$\mathcal{O}(100)$ signal events at XENONnT combined with the detection, or the
lack of detection, of a mono-jet signal at the LHC Run 3 would significantly
narrow the range of possible dark matter-nucleon interactions. As we argued

another significant performance improvement, the tighter coupling favouring the

simple observation is that dual conformal transformations preserve unitarity
cut conditions for any planar integrals, including those without dual conformal
symmetry. Such transformations generate differential equations without raised
propagator powers, often with the right hand side of the system proportional to
the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$. A nontrivial subgroup of
dual conformal transformations, which leaves all external momenta invariant,
generates integration-by-parts relations without raised propagator powers,
reproducing, in a simpler form, previous results from computational algebraic
geometry for several examples with up to two loops and five legs. By opening up
the two-loop three- and four-point nonplanar diagrams into planar ones, we find
a nonplanar analog of dual conformal symmetry. As for the planar case this is
used to generate integration-by-parts relations and differential equations.
This implies that the symmetry is tied to the analytic properties of the
nonplanar sector of the two-loop four-point amplitude of $\mathcal N = 4$

the standard approach has been based on correlation or feature selection with
minimal consideration given to motion consistency. Thus, there is still a need
to capture various physical constraints through motion consistency which will
improve accuracy, robustness and more importantly rotation adaptiveness.
Therefore, one of the major aspects of this paper is to investigate the outcome
of rotation adaptiveness in visual object tracking. Among other key

gravitational collapse to a black hole are rather well understood for uniformly
rotating models. This is not the case for differentially rotating neutron
stars, which are expected to be produced in catastrophic events such as the
merger of binary system of neutron stars or the collapse of a massive stellar
core. We consider sequences of differentially rotating equilibrium models using
the $j$-constant law and by combining them with their dynamical evolution, we
show that a sufficient stability criterion for differentially rotating neutron
stars exists similar to the one of their uniformly rotating counterparts.
Namely: along a sequence of constant angular momentum, a dynamical instability
sets in for central rest-mass densities slightly below the one of the
equilibrium solution at the turning point. In addition, following Breu &
Rezzolla (2016), we show that ""quasi-universal"" relations can be found when
calculating the turning-point mass. In turn, this allows us to compute the
maximum mass allowed by differential rotation, $M_{\rm

$M_{_{\rm TOV}}$, finding that $M_{\rm max, dr} \simeq \left(1.54 \pm

who can simultaneously consume and produce energy, and a grid power company is
studied. The problem is formulated as a single-leader, multiple-follower
Stackelberg game between the power company and multiple prosumers. In this
game, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy
that maximizes its profits, while the prosumers act as followers who react by
choosing the amount of energy to buy or sell so as to optimize their current
and future profits. The proposed game accounts for each prosumer's subjective
decision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random
future price. In particular, the framing effect, from the framework of prospect
theory (PT), is used to account for each prosumer's valuation of its gains and
losses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference
point changes between prosumers and stems from their past experience and future
aspirations of profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a
unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) under classical game theory (CGT)
which is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The results are extended
to account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an
NE under certain conditions. Simulation results show that the total grid load
varies significantly with the prosumers' reference point and their
loss-aversion level. In addition, it is shown that the power company's profits
considerably decrease when it fails to account for the prosumers' subjective

face-on inclination in the range 5--8$^{\circ}$, depending on the neutron star
and donor masses. After determining the veiling of the secondary, we derive a
distance to the binary of $3.8\pm0.7$ kpc, yielding a 0.3--10 keV X-ray
luminosity of $6.1\pm1.9\times10^{33}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, similar to confirmed
transitional millisecond pulsars. As face-on binaries rarely occur by chance,
we discuss the possibility that Fermi-selected samples of transitional
milli-second pulsars in the sub-luminous disk state are affected by beaming. By
phasing emission line strength on the spectroscopic ephemeris, we find coherent
variations, and argue that these variations are most consistent with emission
from an asymmetric shock originating near the inner disk.

merging galaxies during the hierarchical assembly of the cosmic structure, and
are expected to be the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the low
frequency domain. However, because of the dearth of energy exchanges with
background stars and gas, many of these MBHBs may stall at separations too
large for GW emission to drive them to coalescence in less than a Hubble time.
Triple MBH systems are then bound to form after a further galaxy merger,
triggering a complex and rich dynamics that can eventually lead to MBH
coalescence. Here we report on the results of a large set of numerical
simulations, where MBH triplets are set in spherical stellar potentials and MBH
dynamics is followed through 2.5 post-Newtonian order in the equations of
motion. From our full suite of simulated systems we find that a fraction
$\simeq 20-30$% of the MBH binaries that would otherwise stall are led to
coalesce within a Hubble time. The corresponding coalescence timescale peaks
around 300 Myr, while the eccentricity close to the plunge, albeit small, is
non-negligible ($\lesssim 0.1$). We construct and discuss marginalised
probability distributions of the main parameters involved and, in a companion
paper of the series, we will use the results presented here to forecast the
contribution of MBH triplets to the GW signal in the nHz regime probed by

minimization and the Lomb-Scargle method both revealed rotation periods of
13.452 hr. Throughout the 2011/12 apparition, the rotation period was found to
increase by a small amount, consistent with a retrograde rotation of the
nucleus. We also reanalyzed the publicly available data from the 1984/85
apparition by applying the same techniques, finding a rotation period of 13.45
+/- 0.01 hr. Based on these findings we show that the change in rotation period
is less than 14 seconds per apparition. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the
light curves from the two apparitions are comparable, to within reasonable
errors, even though the viewing geometries differ, implying that we are seeing
the comet at a similar sub-Earth latitude. We detected the presence of a short

implies that a single source region dominates activity, rather than leakage

the evolution of these quantities from $z\sim0.3$ to $2.2$ and find that the EW

shown by previous studies, the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity density from star-forming

mirror the decline seen in the H$\alpha$ luminosity density from $z=2.2$ to

galaxy mergers are expected to be the loudest gravitational-wave (GW) sources
relevant for pulsar-timing arrays (PTAs) at nHz frequencies. The incoherent
overlap of signals from a cosmic population of MBHBs gives rise to a stochastic
GW background (GWB) with characteristic strain around $h_c\sim10^{-15}$ at a
reference frequency of 1 yr$^{-1}$, although uncertainties around this value
are large. Current PTAs are piercing into the GW amplitude range predicted by
MBHB-population models, but no detection has been reported so far. To assess
the future success prospects of PTA experiments, it is therefore important to
estimate the minimum GWB level consistent with our current understanding of the
formation and evolution of galaxies and massive black holes (MBHs). To this
purpose, we couple a semianalytic model of galaxy evolution and an extensive
study of the statistical outcome of triple MBH interactions. We show that even
in the most pessimistic scenario where all MBHBs stall before entering the
GW-dominated regime, triple interactions resulting from subsequent galaxy
mergers inevitably drive a considerable fraction of the MBHB population to
coalescence. At frequencies relevant for PTA, the resulting GWB is only a
factor of 2-to-3 suppressed compared to a fiducial model where binaries are
allowed to merge over Gyr timescales. Coupled with current estimates of the
expected GWB amplitude range, our findings suggest that the minimum GWB from
cosmic MBHBs is unlikely to be lower than $h_c\sim 10^{-16}$ (at $f = 1$
yr$^{-1}$), well within the expected sensitivity of projected PTAs based on
future observations with FAST, MeerKAT and SKA.

a nominal 5-sigma surface brightness limit of SB = 1.9x10$^{-18}$
erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$ over a 1 arcsec$^2$ aperture, collapsing 5 wavelength
slices centered at the expected location of the redshifted Lyman-Alpha emission
(i.e. at 9256 Ang.). Current data suggest the presence (5-sigma, accounting for
systematics) of a Lyman-Alpha nebula that extends for 9 kpc around the QSO.
This emission is displaced and redshifted by 155 km/s with respect to the
location of the QSO host galaxy traced by the [CII] emission line. The total
luminosity is L = 3.0x10$^{42}$ erg/s. Our analysis suggests that this emission
is unlikely to rise from optically thick clouds illuminated by the ionizing
radiation of the QSO. It is more plausible that the Lyman-Alpha emission is due
to fluorescence of the highly ionized optically thin gas. This scenario implies
a high hydrogen volume density of n$_H$ ~ 6 cm$^{-3}$. In addition, we detect a
Lyman-Alpha emitter (LAE) in the immediate vicinity of the QSO: i.e., with a
projected separation of 12.5 kpc and a line-of-sight velocity difference of 560
km/s. The luminosity of the LAE is L = 2.1x10$^{42}$ erg/s and its inferred
star-formation-rate is SFR ~ 1.3 M$_\odot$/yr. The probability of finding such
a close LAE is one order of magnitude above the expectations based on the

properties of the YSC population of the whole galaxy, considering a
mass-limited sample. Both luminosity and mass functions follow a power law
shape with slope -2, but at high luminosities and masses a dearth of sources is
observed. The analysis of the mass function suggests that it is best fitted by
a Schechter function with slope -2 and a truncation mass at
$1.00\pm0.12\times10^5\ M_\odot$. Through Monte Carlo simulations we confirm
this result and link the shape of the luminosity function to the presence of a
truncation in the mass function. A mass limited age function analysis, between
10 and 200 Myr, suggests that the cluster population is undergoing only
moderate disruption. We observe little variation in the shape of the mass
function at masses above $1\times10^4\ M_\odot$, over this age range. The

based on a deep Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3-mm continuum mosaic
of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Excluding the most heavily-obscured
sources, we use a stacking analysis to show that z~2.5 star-forming galaxies in
the mass range 9.25 <= log(M/Msun) <= 10.75 are fully consistent with the
IRX-beta relation expected for a relatively grey attenuation curve, similar to
the commonly adopted Calzetti law. Based on a large, mass complete, sample of 2
<= z <= 3 star-forming galaxies drawn from multiple surveys, we proceed to
derive a new empirical relationship between beta and stellar mass, making it
possible to predict UV attenuation (A_1600) and IRX as a function of stellar
mass, for any assumed attenuation law. Once again, we find that z~2.5
star-forming galaxies follow A_1600-mass and IRX-mass relations consistent with
a relatively grey attenuation law, and find no compelling evidence that
star-forming galaxies at this epoch follow a reddening law as steep as the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve. In fact, we use a simple
simulation to demonstrate that previous determinations of the IRX-beta relation
may have been biased toward low values of IRX at red values of beta, mimicking
the signature expected for an SMC-like dust law. We show that this provides a
plausible mechanism for reconciling apparently contradictory results in the
literature and that, based on typical measurement uncertainties, stellar mass
provides a cleaner prediction of UV attenuation than beta. Although the
situation at lower stellar masses remains uncertain, we conclude that for 2<z<3
star-forming galaxies with log(M/Msun) >= 9.75, both the IRX-beta and IRX-mass
relations are well described by a Calzetti-like attenuation law.

new physics models, Standard Model (SM) with a real scalar singlet extension,
and Two Higgs Double Model (2HDM) as examples of weakly-interacting models,
Minimal Composite Higgs Model (MCHM) and three typical patterns of the more
general operator counting for strong interacting models as examples of strong
dynamics. We performed a global fit to various Higgs search channels to obtain
the 95% C.L. constraints on the model parameter space. In the SM with a singlet
extension, we obtained the limits on the singlet-doublet mixing angle
sin(theta), as well as the more general Wilson coefficients of the induced
higher dimensional operators. In the 2HDM, we analyzed tree level effects in
tan(beta) vs. cos(beta-alpha) plane, as well as the one-loop contributions from
the heavy Higgs bosons in the alignment limit to obtain the constraints on
heavy Higgs masses for different types of 2HDM. In strong dynamics models, we
obtained lower limits on the strong dynamics scale. In addition, once
deviations of Higgs couplings are observed, they can be used to distinguish
different models. We also compared the sensitivity of various future Higgs
factories, namely Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), Future Circular
Collider (FCC)-ee and International Linear Collider (ILC).

dark matter haloes have hundreds of dark matter subhaloes with mass $\gtrsim

these may pass close to the central region and interact with the disc. We
extract the properties of subhaloes, such as their mass and trajectories, from
a realistic cosmological simulation to study their potential effect on stellar
discs. We find that massive subhalo impacts can generate disc heating, rings,
bars, warps, lopsidedness as wells as spiral structures in the disc.
Specifically, strong counter-rotating single-armed spiral structures form each
time a massive subhalo passes through the disc. Such single-armed spirals wind
up relatively quickly (over $1-2$ Gyrs) and are generally followed by
co-rotating two-armed spiral structures that both develop and wind up more
slowly. In our simulations self-gravity in the disc is not very strong and
these spiral structures are found to be kinematic density waves. We demonstrate
that there is a clear link between each spiral mode in the disc and a given
subhalo that caused it, and by changing the mass of the subhalo we can modulate
the strength of the spirals. Furthermore, we find that the majority of
subhaloes interact with the disc impulsively, such that the strength of spirals
generated by subhaloes is proportional to the total torque they exert. We
conclude that only a handful of encounters with massive subhaloes is sufficient
for re-generating and sustaining spiral structures in discs over their entire

memory properties applied in various fields like econometrics, hydrology and
climatology. The computational cost in fitting an fGn model of length $n$ using
a likelihood-based approach is ${\mathcal O}(n^{2})$, exploiting the Toeplitz
structure of the covariance matrix. In most realistic cases, we do not observe
the fGn process directly but only through indirect Gaussian observations, so
the Toeplitz structure is easily lost and the computational cost increases to
${\mathcal O}(n^{3})$. This paper presents an approximate fGn model of
${\mathcal O}(n)$ computational cost, both with direct or indirect Gaussian
observations, with or without conditioning. This is achieved by approximating
fGn with a weighted sum of independent first-order autoregressive processes,
fitting the parameters of the approximation to match the autocorrelation
function of the fGn model. The resulting approximation is stationary despite
being Markov and gives a remarkably accurate fit using only four components.
The performance of the approximate fGn model is demonstrated in simulations and
two real data examples.

  Supernovae","14 pages, 8 figures, accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx2734",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are a growing number of nearby SNe for which the progenitor star is
detected in archival pre-explosion imaging. From these images it is possible to
measure the progenitor's brightness a few years before explosion, and
ultimately estimate its initial mass. Previous work has shown that II-P and
II-L supernovae (SNe) have Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitors, and that the range
of initial masses for these progenitors seems to be limited to $<$17M$_\odot$.
This is in contrast with the cutoff of 25-30M$_\odot$ predicted by evolutionary
models, a result which is termed the 'Red Supergiant Problem'. Here we
investigate one particular source of systematic error present in converting
pre-explosion photometry into an initial mass, that of the bolometric
correction (BC) used to convert a single-band flux into a bolometric
luminosity. We show, using star clusters, that RSGs evolve to later spectral
types as they approach SN, which in turn causes the BC to become larger.
Failure to account for this results in a systematic underestimate of a star's
luminosity, and hence its initial mass. Using our empirically motivated BCs we
reappraise the II-P and II-L SNe that have their progenitors detected in
pre-explosion imaging. Fitting an initial mass function to these updated masses
results in an increased upper mass cutoff of $M_{\rm
hi}$=$19.0^{+2.5}_{-1.3}$M$_\odot$, with a 95% upper confidence limit of
$<$27M$_\odot$. Accounting for finite sample size effects and systematic
uncertainties in the mass-luminosity relationship raises the cutoff to $M_{\rm
hi}$=25M$_\odot$ ($<$33M$_\odot$, 95% confidence). We therefore conclude that
there is currently no strong evidence for `missing' high mass progenitors to

gravitating solitons that are known to form dynamically, via a classical
process of (incomplete) gravitational collapse. As stationary solutions of the
Einstein--Klein-Gordon or the Einstein--Proca theory, bosonic stars may also
become sufficiently compact to develop light rings and hence mimic, in
principle, gravitational-wave observational signatures of black holes (BHs). In
this paper, we discuss how these horizonless ultra-compact objects (UCOs) are
actually distinct from BHs, both phenomenologically and dynamically. In the
electromagnetic channel, the light ring associated phenomenology reveals
remarkable lensing patterns, quite distinct from a standard BH shadow, with an
infinite number of Einstein rings accumulating in the vicinity of the light
ring, both inside and outside the latter. The strong lensing region, moreover,
can be considerably smaller than the shadow of a BH with a comparable mass.
Dynamically, we investigate the fate of such UCOs under perturbations, via
fully non-linear numerical simulations and observe that, in all cases, they
decay into a Schwarzschild BH within a time scale of $\mathcal{O}(M)$, where
$M$ is the mass of the bosonic star. Both these studies reinforce how difficult
it is for horizonless UCOs to mimic BH phenomenology and dynamics, in all its
aspects.

coherence. A key step in the proposed framework is the construction of an FFDD
dissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles, based on the
fast marching method (FMM). The obtained aligned WM tract-profiles enable
meaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. We
demonstrate our method using two different datasets of contact sports players.
Along-tract pairwise comparison as well as group-wise analysis, with respect to

infer a semantic concept quickly after looking at only a very small number of

point. The case with a significant communication delay for control is also
analyzed. We evaluate the proposed control laws with realistic numerical
simulations. Under current technology, the proposed control laws achieve a
convergence time that is smaller than droop control alone and is comparable to
that of distributed control without interdependent costs. Results also
highlight significant cost savings over existing approaches under a variety of

(CI testing) for continuous random variables. Given i.i.d samples from the
joint distribution $f(x,y,z)$ of continuous random vectors $X,Y$ and $Z,$ we
determine whether $X \perp Y | Z$. We approach this by converting the
conditional independence test into a classification problem. This allows us to
harness very powerful classifiers like gradient-boosted trees and deep neural
networks. These models can handle complex probability distributions and allow
us to perform significantly better compared to the prior state of the art, for
high-dimensional CI testing. The main technical challenge in the classification
problem is the need for samples from the conditional product distribution
$f^{CI}(x,y,z) = f(x|z)f(y|z)f(z)$ -- the joint distribution if and only if $X
\perp Y | Z.$ -- when given access only to i.i.d. samples from the true joint
distribution $f(x,y,z)$. To tackle this problem we propose a novel nearest
neighbor bootstrap procedure and theoretically show that our generated samples
are indeed close to $f^{CI}$ in terms of total variational distance. We then
develop theoretical results regarding the generalization bounds for
classification for our problem, which translate into error bounds for CI
testing. We provide a novel analysis of Rademacher type classification bounds
in the presence of non-i.i.d near-independent samples. We empirically validate
the performance of our algorithm on simulated and real datasets and show
performance gains over previous methods.

with reversible transformations generally only possible in the limit of many
copies. Here, we show that reversible entanglement transformations do not
require processing on the many copy level, but can instead be undertaken on
individual systems, provided the amount of entanglement which is produced or
consumed is allowed to fluctuate. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for entanglement manipulations in this case. As a corollary, we derive an
equation which quantifies the fluctuations of entanglement, which is formally
identical to the Jarzynski fluctuation equality found in thermodynamics. One
can also relate a forward entanglement transformation to its reverse process in
terms of the entanglement cost of such a transformation, in a manner equivalent
to the Crooks relation. We show that a strong converse theorem for entanglement
transformations is formally related to the second law of thermodynamics, while
the fact that the Schmidt rank of an entangled state cannot increase is related
to the third law of thermodynamics. Achievability of the protocols is done by
introducing an entanglement battery, a device which stores entanglement and
uses an amount of entanglement that is allowed to fluctuate but with an average
cost which is still optimal. This allows us to also solve the problem of
partial entanglement recovery, and in fact, we show that entanglement is fully
recovered. Allowing the amount of consumed entanglement to fluctuate also leads
to improved and optimal entanglement dilution protocols.

UV bandpass, with multiple resolution modes to support different science goals.
The instrument will provide low (R = 8,000-18,000) and medium (R =
30,000-65,000) resolution modes across the far-ultraviolet (FUV: 100-200 nm)

(R = 500) for spectroscopic investigations of extremely faint objects in the
FUV. Imaging spectroscopy will be accomplished over a 3 x 1.6 arcminute
field-of-view by employing holographically-ruled diffraction gratings to
control optical aberrations, microshutter arrays (MSA), advanced optical
coatings for high-throughput in the FUV, and next generation large-format

regions of synthesis (mature leaves) to sugar sinks (roots, fruits). In this
process, known as M\""unch pressure flow, the loading of sugars from
photosynthetic cells to the export conduit (the phloem) is crucial, as it sets
the pressure head necessary to power long-distance transport. Whereas most
herbaceous plants use active mechanisms to increase phloem concentration above
that of the photosynthetic cells, in most tree species, for which transport
distances are largest, loading seems to occur via passive symplastic diffusion
from the mesophyll to the phloem. Here, we use a synthetic microfluidic model
of a passive loader to explore the nonlinear dynamics that arise during export
and determine the ability of passive loading to drive long-distance transport.
We first demonstrate that in our device, phloem concentration is set by the
balance between the resistances to diffusive loading from the source and
convective export through the phloem. Convection-limited export corresponds to
classical models of M\""unch transport, where phloem concentration is close to
that of the source; in contrast, diffusion-limited export leads to small phloem
concentrations and weak scaling of flow rates with the hydraulic resistance. We
then show that the effective regime of convection-limited export is predominant
in plants with large transport resistances and low xylem pressures. Moreover,
hydrostatic pressures developed in our synthetic passive loader can reach
botanically relevant values as high as 10 bars. We conclude that passive
loading is sufficient to drive long-distance transport in large plants, and
that trees are well suited to take full advantage of passive phloem loading
strategies.

Reflections and Einstein-Rosen bridges is discussed: our proposal gives a
precise mechanism for the apparent loss of quantum information in a black hole
by the process of nonlocal Andreev reflection, transferring the quantum
information through a wormhole and into another universe. Given these
established connections, we conjecture that the final quantum state of a black
hole is exactly the same as the ground state wavefunction of the
superconductor/superfluid in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of
superconductivity; in particular, the infalling matter and the infalling
Hawking quanta, described in the Horowitz-Maldacena model, forms a Cooper
pair-like singlet state inside the black hole. A black hole evaporating and
shrinking in size can be thought of as the analogue of Andreev reflection by a
hole where the superconductor loses a Cooper pair. Our model does not suffer
from the black hole information problem since Andreev reflection is unitary. We

classical theory assumes p = 0 and provides an inter- connection theory for
stability analysis, i.e. convergence to a zero dimensional attractor. The
generalized theory is shown to provide an interconnection theory for
p-dominance analysis, i.e. convergence to a p-dimensional dominant subspace. In
turn, this property is the differential characterization of a generalized
contraction property for nonlinear systems. The proposed generalization opens a
novel avenue for the analysis of interconnected systems with low-dimensional

Individual agents make sensor measurements of an unknown parameter belonging to
a compact set, and, at every time step, a fraction of the agents' sensor
measurements may fall under attack and take arbitrary values. We present the
Saturated Innovation Update ($\mathcal{SIU}$) algorithm for distributed
estimation resilient to sensor attacks. Under the iterative $\mathcal{SIU}$
algorithm, if less than one half of the agent sensors fall under attack, then,
all of the agents' estimates converge at a polynomial rate (with respect to the

to sensor attacks does not depend on the topology of the inter-agent
communication network, as long as it remains connected. We demonstrate the

2-category of bundle gerbes and show that these categories are cartesian
monoidal and abelian. Endomorphisms of the trivial bundle gerbe, or higher
functions, carry the structure of a rig-category, which acts on generic
morphism categories of bundle gerbes. We continue by presenting a
categorification of the hermitean metric on a hermitean line bundle. This is
achieved by introducing a functorial dual that extends the dual of vector
bundles to morphisms of bundle gerbes, and constructing a two-variable
adjunction for the aforementioned rig-module category structure on morphism
categories. Its right internal hom is the module action, composed by taking the
dual of higher functions, while the left internal hom is interpreted as a
bundle gerbe metric. Sections of bundle gerbes are defined as morphisms from
the trivial bundle gerbe to a given bundle gerbe. The resulting categories of
sections carry a rig-module structure over the category of finite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces. A suitable definition of 2-Hilbert spaces is given, modifying
previous definitions by the use of two-variable adjunctions. We prove that the
category of sections of a bundle gerbe fits into this framework, thus obtaining
a 2-Hilbert space of sections. In particular, this can be constructed for
prequantum bundle gerbes in problems of higher geometric quantisation. We
define a dimensional reduction functor and show that the categorical structures
introduced on bundle gerbes naturally reduce to their counterparts on hermitean
line bundles with connections. In several places in this thesis, we provide
examples, making 2-Hilbert spaces of sections and dimensional reduction very

determined. For such tasks, it is important to leverage some width parameters
of the circuit, such as bounded treewidth or pathwidth, to convert the circuit
to structured classes, e.g., deterministic structured NNFs (d-SDNNFs) or OBDDs.
In this work, we show how to connect the width of circuits to the size of their
structured representation, through upper and lower bounds. For the upper bound,
we show how bounded-treewidth circuits can be converted to a d-SDNNF, in time
linear in the circuit size. Our bound, unlike existing results, is constructive
and only singly exponential in the treewidth. We show a related lower bound on
monotone DNF or CNF formulas, assuming a constant bound on the arity (size of
clauses) and degree (number of occurrences of each variable). Specifically, any
d-SDNNF (resp., SDNNF) for such a DNF (resp., CNF) must be of exponential size
in its treewidth; and the same holds for pathwidth when compiling to OBDDs. Our
lower bounds, in contrast with most previous work, apply to any formula of this
class, not just a well-chosen family. Hence, for our language of DNF and CNF,
pathwidth and treewidth respectively characterize the efficiency of compiling
to OBDDs and (d-)SDNNFs, that is, compilation is singly exponential in the
width parameter. We conclude by applying our lower bound results to the task of
query evaluation.

approach allows delivering a tunable degree of local entanglement to a distant
receiver by simply altering a modal phase delay holographically, or, in
essence, a tractor beam for entanglement. This demonstration highlights a
hitherto unnoticed property of classical entanglement and offers at the same

microfluidic tissue-mimicking mazes: cell sequence and mitosis. Surprisingly,
it was found that in both cases, the cells display behavior that is
contradictory to the chemoattractant gradient established in the maze. In case
of the sequence, the cells do not like to take the same path through the maze
as their predecessor, when faced with a bifurcation. To the contrary, they tend
to alternate - if a leading cell takes the shorter (steeper gradient) path, the
cell following it chooses the longer (weaker gradient) path, and vice versa.
Additionally, we found that when a mother cell divides, its two daughters go in
opposite directions (even if it means migrating against the chemoattractant
gradient and overcoming on-going cell traffic). Therefore, it is apparent that
fibroblasts modify each other's directional decisions in a manner that is
counter-intuitive to what is expected from classical chemotaxis theory.
Consequently, accounting for these effects could lead to a better understanding
of tissue generation in vivo, and result in more advanced engineered tissue
products in vitro.

that Eu distribution is not uniform, it enter quint-layers forming inside them

increase with the growth of Eu content. Positive magnetoresistance related to
the weak antilocalization was observed up to 15K. The antilocalization was not
followed by weak localization as theory predicts for nontrivial topological
states. Surprisingly, the features of antilocalization were seen even at Eu
content $x$ $=$ 0.21. With the increase of Eu content the transition to
ferromagnetic state occurs at $x$ about 0.1 and with the Curie temperature
$\approx$ 8K, that rises up to 64K for $x$ $=$ 0.21. At temperatures above 1-2
K, the dephasing length is proportional to $T^{-1/2}$ indicating the dominant
contribution of inelastic $e-e$ scattering into electron phase breaking.
However, at low temperatures the dephasing length saturates, that could be due
to the scattering on magnetic ions.

$\mu^\Gamma(x):=[c]\otimes j^\Gamma(x)$, where $j^\Gamma$ is a $KK$-theoretical

scales linearly with the average degree over most of the density range. While
the scaling laws obtained are purely empirical, if they continue to hold in

uncertainty, mitigates brightness fluctuations, and is independent of previous
methods. Combining a 13-yr baseline of Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2)
images in the F631N filter, with a 4-yr baseline of Advanced Camera for
Surveys/High Resolution Channel (ACS/HRC) images in the F550M filter, yields an
ejection date (assuming linear motion) of 1847.1 ($\pm$0.8 yr). This result
improves the precision, but is in excellent agreement with the previous study
by Morse et al.\ (2001) that used a shorter time baseline and a different
analysis method. This more precise date is inconsistent with ejection during a
periastron passage of the eccentric binary. Ejection occured well into the main
plateau of the Great Eruption, and not during the brief peaks in 1843 and 1838.
The age uncertainty is dominated by a real spread in ages of various knots, and
by some irregular brightness fluctuations. Several knots appear to have been
ejected decades before or after the mean date, implying a complicated history
of mass-loss episodes outside the main bright phase of the eruption. The
extended history of mass ejection may have been largely erased by the passage
of a shock through clumpy ejecta, as most material was swept into a thin shell

structure the observational data to approximate data from a hypothetical, but
realistic, randomized experiment. This approach, based on insights from
classical experimental design, involves four stages, and relies on modern
computing to implement the effort in two of the four stages.More specifically,
our strategy involves: 1) a conceptual stage that involves the precise
formulation of the causal question in terms of a hypothetical randomized
experiment where the exposure is assigned to units; 2) a design stage that
attempts to reconstruct (or approximate) a randomized experiment before any
outcome data are observed, 3) a statistical analysis comparing the outcomes of
interest in the exposed and non-exposed units of the hypothetical randomized
experiment, and 4) a summary stage providing conclusions about statistical
evidence for the sizes of possible causal effects of the exposure on outcomes.

useful in several machine learning tasks including correlation mining,

independence testing in (causal) graphical models. While mutual information is
a well-defined quantity in general probability spaces, existing estimators can
only handle two special cases of purely discrete or purely continuous pairs of
random variables. The main challenge is that these methods first estimate the
(differential) entropies of X, Y and the pair (X;Y) and add them up with
appropriate signs to get an estimate of the mutual information. These
3H-estimators cannot be applied in general mixture spaces, where entropy is not
well-defined. In this paper, we design a novel estimator for mutual information
of discrete-continuous mixtures. We prove that the proposed estimator is
consistent. We provide numerical experiments suggesting superiority of the
proposed estimator compared to other heuristics of adding small continuous
noise to all the samples and applying standard estimators tailored for purely
continuous variables, and quantizing the samples and applying standard
estimators tailored for purely discrete variables. This significantly widens
the applicability of mutual information estimation in real-world applications,

extragalactic blazars that appear point-like within the LAT angular resolution,
there are several physics scenarios that predict the existence of populations
of spatially extended sources. If Dark Matter consists of Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles, the annihilation or decay of these particles in subhalos of
the Milky Way would appear as a population of unassociated gamma-ray sources
with finite angular extent. Gamma-ray emission from blazars could also be
extended (so-called pair halos) due to the deflection of electron-positron
pairs in the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). The pairs are produced in the
absorption of gamma rays in the intergalactic medium and subsequently
up-scatter photons of background radiation fields to gamma-ray energies.
Measurement of pair halos could provide constraints on the strength and
coherence length scale of the IGMF. In a dedicated search, we find 21 extended
sources and 16 sources not previously characterized as extended. Limits on the
flux of the extended source components are used to derive constraints on the

accomplished when the agents get to the same node in the same round. We want to
achieve a more demanding goal, called rendezvous with detection: agents must
become aware that the meeting is accomplished, simultaneously declare this and
stop. This awareness depends on how an agent can communicate to the other agent
its presence at a node. We use two variations of the arguably weakest model of
communication, called the beeping model, introduced in [8]. In each round an
agent can either listen or beep. In the local beeping model, an agent hears a
beep in a round if it listens in this round and if the other agent is at the

size of the network and in the length of the smaller label (i.e., in the
logarithm of this label). However, in this algorithm, agents spend a lot of
energy: the number of moves that an agent must make, is proportional to the
time of rendezvous. It is thus natural to ask if bounded-energy agents can
always achieve rendezvous with detection as well...

diameter 1, and meeting occurs when these discs touch. Agents have different
labels which are integers from the set of 0 to L-1. Each agent knows L and
knows its own label, but not the label of the other agent. Agents are equipped
with compasses and have synchronized clocks. They make a series of moves. Each
move specifies the direction and the duration of moving. This includes a null
move which consists in staying inert for some time, or forever. In a non-null
move agents travel at the same constant speed, normalized to 1. We assume that
agents have sensors enabling them to estimate the distance from the other agent
(defined as the distance between centers of discs), but not the direction
towards it. We consider two models of estimation. In both models an agent reads
its sensor at the moment of its appearance in the plane and then at the end of
each move. This reading (together with the previous ones) determines the
decision concerning the next move. In both models the reading of the sensor
tells the agent if the other agent is already present. Moreover, in the
monotone model, each agent can find out, for any two readings in moments t1 and
t2, whether the distance from the other agent at time t1 was smaller, equal or
larger than at time t2. In the weaker binary model, each agent can find out, at
any reading, whether it is at distance less than \r{ho} or at distance at least
\r{ho} from the other agent, for some real \r{ho} > 1 unknown to them. Such
distance estimation mechanism can be implemented, e.g., using chemical sensors.
Each agent emits some chemical substance (scent), and the sensor of the other

rheology to the underlying microstructure dynamics. In particular, a
macroscopic continuum model of polymeric fluids is constructed without a
pre-specified constitutive relation, but instead it is actively learned from
mesoscopic simulations where the dynamics of polymer chains is explicitly
computed. To couple the macroscopic rheology of polymeric fluids and the
microscale dynamics of polymer chains, the continuum approach (based on the
finite volume method) provides the transient flow field as inputs for the
(mesoscopic) dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), and in turn DPD returns an
effective constitutive relation to close the continuum equations. In this
multiscale modeling procedure, we employ an active learning strategy based on
Gaussian process regression (GPR) to minimize the number of expensive DPD
simulations, where adaptively selected DPD simulations are performed only as
necessary. Numerical experiments are carried out for flow past a circular
cylinder of a non-Newtonian fluid, modeled at the mesoscopic level by
bead-spring chains. The results show that only five DPD simulations are
required to achieve an effective closure of the continuum equations at Reynolds
number Re=10. Furthermore, when Re is increased to 100, only one additional DPD
simulation is required for constructing an extended GPR-informed model closure.
Compared to traditional message-passing multiscale approaches, applying an
active learning scheme to multiscale modeling of non-Newtonian fluids can
significantly increase the computational efficiency. Although the method
demonstrated here obtains only a local viscosity from the mesoscopic model, it
can be extended to other multiscale models of complex fluids whose
macro-rheology is unknown.

(SR). To the best of our knowledge, however, few SR methods were concerned with
compressed images. The SR of compressed images is a challenging task due to the
complicated compression artifacts, while many images suffer from them in
practice. The intuitive solution for this difficult task is to decouple it into
two sequential but independent subproblems, i.e., compression artifacts
reduction (CAR) and SR. Nevertheless, some useful details may be removed in CAR
stage, which is contrary to the goal of SR and makes the SR stage more
challenging. In this paper, an end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural
network is designed to perform SR on compressed images (CISRDCNN), which
reduces compression artifacts and improves image resolution jointly.
Experiments on compressed images produced by JPEG (we take the JPEG as an
example in this paper) demonstrate that the proposed CISRDCNN yields
state-of-the-art SR performance on commonly used test images and imagesets. The
results of CISRDCNN on real low quality web images are also very impressive,
with obvious quality enhancement. Further, we explore the application of the
proposed SR method in low bit-rate image coding, leading to better
rate-distortion performance than JPEG.

observed, this catalogue provides the first representative sample of GRB radio
properties, unbiased by multi-wavelength selection criteria. We report the
detection of six GRB radio afterglows that were not previously detected by
other radio telescopes, increasing the rate of radio detections by 50% over an

spontaneous individual collapses which generate non-vanishing expectation
values of various physical quantities taken as ansatz modifications of the
standard inflationary scenario; ii) the proposal based on a Continuous
Spontaneous Localization (CSL) type modification of the Schr\""odinger evolution
of the inflaton wave function, based on a natural choice of collapse operator.
We perform a systematic analysis within the semi-classical gravity

slightly from those of the standard cosmological model. We also analyse these
proposals with a Bayesian model comparison using recent CMB and Baryonic
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. Our results show a moderate preference of the
joint CMB and BAO data for one of the studied collapse schemes model over the

a causal structure of unknown classicality, the presence of such correlations

device-independent fashion. In structures where all parties share a common
resource, these nonclassical correlations are also known as nonlocal
correlations. Any constraint satisfied by all correlations which are
classically compatible with a given causal structure defines a causal
compatibility criterion. Such criteria were recently derived for the Triangle

inequalities, begging the question of whether any of those inequalities admit
violation by quantum correlations. Numerical investigation suggests that they
do not, and we further conjecture that the set of correlations admitted by the
classical Triangle structure is equivalent to the set of correlations admitted
by its quantum generalization whenever the three observable variables are
binary. Our main contribution in this work, however, is the derivation of new
causal compatibility inequalities for the Triangle structure which do admit

and emission regime (optically thick or thin), the emitting particle
properties, and propagation effects. Here, we report an unusual flare,
SOL2012-07-06T01:37, whose optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission of the main
source displays an apparently ordinary mode sense of polarization in contrast
to the classical theory that favors the extraordinary mode. This flare produced
copious nonthermal emission in hard X-rays and in high-frequency microwaves up
to 80 GHz. It is found that the main flare source corresponds to an interaction
site of two loops with greatly different sizes. We have investigated the three
possible known reasons of the circular polarization sense reversal - mode
coupling, positron contribution, and the effect of beamed angular distribution.
We excluded polarization reversal due to contribution of positrons because
there was no relevant response in the X-ray emission. We find that a beam-like
electron distribution can produce the observed polarization behavior, but the
source thermal density must be much higher than the estimate from to the X-ray
data. We conclude that the apparent ordinary wave emission in the optically
thin mode is due to radio wave propagation across the quasi-transverse (QT)
layer. The abnormally high transition frequency (above 35 GHz) can be achieved
reasonably low in the corona where the magnetic field value is high and
transverse to the line of sight. This places the microwave source below this QT
layer, i.e. very low in the corona.

estimator as the Highly-Adaptive-Lasso estimator due to the fact that the
constrained can be formulated as a bound $M$ on the sum of the coefficients a
linear combination of a very large number of basis functions. Specifically, in
the case that the target parameter is a conditional mean, then it can be

this rate is that the true parameter function has a finite variation norm. The
loss-based dissimilarity is often equivalent with the square of an

of OC in the generation of helically polarized high-order harmonics and
attosecond pulses, we first separate the OC of transversal and paraxial beams
to polarization and orbital terms. We find that the polarization-associated OC
of attosecond pulses corresponds to that of the pump in the quasi-monochromatic

the fact that the polarization OC of multi-chromatic pumps vary rapidly in time
along the optical cycle. Thus, we propose new quantities, non-instantaneous
polarization-associated OC, and timescale-weighted polarization-associated OC,
that link the chirality of multi-chromatic pumps and their generated attosecond

Photonic Integrated Circuits in general is the inability to create efficient
relay devices due to small decoherence time, high delays and poor
interconnections that worsen the decoherence and delay problems. A feasible
relay device design is proposed that can work in conjunction with various
sources, be highly tunable over a reasonably large bandwidth and operate with
negligible switching delays. This is achieved with the help of the Transition
Metal Dichalcogenide MoSe2 WSe2 heterojunction and a modulating chirped
strain/acoustic wave is applied to control the operating frequency and other
operational characteristics of the device. The chirping of strain wave is meant
to control the exciton transport across the device. The switching delay is
proposed to reduce by exploiting the exciton dynamics so that the carrier
non-equilibrium is never disturbed and therefore no delay occurs while
switching on or off. MoSe2 WSe2 heterojunction is chosen because of their
binding energy nearly two orders greater than GaAs quantum wells because of
which they demonstrate high exciton response which is electrically tunable even
at room temperature. Also, it is possible to grow TMDC films on Si based
substrates using particular techniques so that their properties are intact.
Such a device can find applications in wide range of components in quantum
optoelectronic integrated circuits such as switches, logic gates, sensors and
buffers.

Compared to shallow water approximation of the Navier-Stokes system, the idea
is to use a Galerkin type approximation of the velocity field with piecewise
constant basis functions in order to obtain an accurate description of the
vertical profile of the horizontal velocity. Such a strategy has several
advantages. It allows - to rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations under the form
of a system of conservation lawswith source terms, - the easy handling of the
free surface, which does not require moving meshes, - the possibility to take
advantage of robust and accurate numerical techniques developed in extensive
amount for Shallow Water type systems. Compared to previous works of some of
the authors, the three dimensional case is studied in this paper. We show that
the model admits a kinetic interpretation including the vertical exchanges
terms, and we use this result to formulate a robust finite volume scheme for
its numerical approximation. All the aspects of the discrete scheme (fluxes,
boundary conditions,. . . ) are completely described and the stability
properties of the proposed numerical scheme (well-balancing, positivity of the

scheme with some numerical academic examples (3d non stationary analytical

the GGF-Fs become indispensable for optimal error estimates of polynomial

families of nonstandard basis functions recently introduced for solving
fractional differential equations. However, some properties of GGF-Fs, which
are important pieces for the analysis and applications, are unknown or under

the bounds of GGF-Fs uniform in $\nu.$ Under an appropriate weight function,
the bounds are uniform for $\theta\in [0,\pi]$ as well. Moreover, we can study
the asymptotics of GGF-Fs with large fractional degree $\nu.$ The second is to
present miscellaneous properties of GGF-Fs for better understanding of this

based image encryption algorithms. Up to an extent these algorithms have been
able to provide an alternative to exchange large media files (images and

with the implementation of chaos based image ciphers in practice. One of them
is reduced/small key space due to the fact that chaotic behavior is only
observed for certain range of system parameters/initial conditions of the
chaotic system used in such algorithms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose
a simple, efficient and robust image encryption algorithm based on combined
applications of quasigroups and chaotic standard map. The proposed image cipher
is based on the popular substitution-diffusion architecture (Shanon) where a
quasigroup of order 256 and chaotic standard map have been used for the
substitution and permutation of image pixels respectively. Due to the
introduction of quasigroup as part of the secret key along with the parameter
and initial conditions of the chaotic standard map, the key space has been
increased significantly. The proposed image cipher is very fast due to the fact
that the substitution based on the quasigroup operations is very simple and can
be executed easily through the lookup table operations on Latin squares (which
are Cayley operation tables of quasigroups) and the permutation is performed
row-by-row as well as column-by-column using the pseudo random number sequences
gener-ated through the chaotic standard map. The security and performance have
been analyzed through the histograms, correlation coefficients, information
entropy, key sensitivity analysis, differential analysis, key space analysis
etc. and the results prove the efficiency and robustness of the proposed image
cipher against the possible security threats.

of the nanostructures that support excitations of phonon-polaritons in
mid-infrared range. We focus on two materials: silicon carbide that has a
nearly isotropic permittivity and hexagonal boron nitride that has a strong
anisotropy and spectral band with hyperbolic dispersion. We aim to predict
scattering-type near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM) response and develop a
modeling approach that adequately describes the resonant behavior of the
nanostructure with phonon-polaritons. The previously employed technique assumes
dipole scattering from the tip and allows calculating s-SNOM signal in
different demodulation orders by modeling full structure, any tip positions,
and vertical scans, which works well for the structures with only one hot spot,
e.g. flat surfaces. In the structures of complex shapes, hot-spot places are
unknown, and analysis of light absorption in the whole apex is the best way to
account for all hot spots and field enhancement. We show that calculation of
demodulation orders of light absorption in the tip is an alternative way to
predict s-SNOM signal, and it is preferred for the structures of complex shapes
with strong resonances, where dipole approximation of the tip is not valid.

popularity and achieve good performance. However, previous works on random
caching scheme usually assumed single antenna at BSs and users, which is not
the case in practical multi-antenna networks. In this paper, we consider the
analysis and optimization in the cache-enabled multi-antenna networks with
limited backhaul. We first derive a closed-form expression and a simple tight
upper bound of the successful transmission probability, using tools from
stochastic geometry and a gamma approximation. Based on the analytic results,
we then consider the area spectrum efficiency maximization by optimizing design
parameters, which is a complicated mixed-integer optimization problem. After
analyzing the optimal properties, we obtain a local optimal solution with lower
complexity. To further simplify the optimization, we then solve an asymptotic
optimization problem in the high user density region, using the upper bound as
the objective function. Numerical simulations show that the asymptotic optimal
caching scheme achieves better performance over existing caching schemes. The
analysis and optimization results provide insightful design guidelines for
random caching in practical networks.

structure around the LKP mass. This paper investigates the observability of
this peak structure by near-future detectors taking account of their energy
resolution, and calculates the expected energy spectrum of the gamma-ray
signal. Then, by using the HESS data, we set some constraints on the boost
factor, which is a product of the annihilation cross section relative to the
thermal one and an uncertain factor dependent on the substructure of the LKP
distribution in the Galactic halo, for each LKP mass. The resulting upper limit
on the boost factor is in the range from 1 to 30. The constraints can be
regarded as comparable with the results of previous work for gamma-ray and
electron-positron observation. However, the observational data for the TeV or
higher energy region are still limited, and the possible LKP signal is not
conclusive. Thus, we expect near-future missions with better sensitivity will
clarify whether the LKP dark matter should exist or not.

Particularly, we prove the existence of a critical connection radius
proportional to ${\Theta(n^{-1/d})}$ for $n$ samples and ${d}$ dimensions:
Below this value the planner is guaranteed to fail (similarly shown by the
aforementioned work, ibid.). More importantly, for larger radius values the
planner is asymptotically (near-)optimal. Furthermore, our analysis yields an
explicit lower bound of ${1-O( n^{-1})}$ on the probability of success. A
practical implication of our work is that asymptotic (near-)optimality is
achieved when each sample is connected to only ${\Theta(1)}$ neighbors. This is
in stark contrast to previous work which requires ${\Theta(\log n)}$
connections, that are induced by a radius of order ${\left(\frac{\log

variety of PRM-based planners, including RRG, FMT* and BTT. Continuum
percolation plays an important role in our proofs. Lastly, we develop similar

portfolios towards regularized versions of efficient allocations. The
regulatory effect of transaction costs is studied in an econometric setting
incorporating parameter uncertainty and optimally combining predictive
distributions resulting from high-frequency and low-frequency data. In an
extensive empirical study, we illustrate that turnover penalization is more
effective than commonly employed shrinkage methods and is crucial in order to
construct empirically well-performing portfolios.

videos. First, music is an art of time, necessitating a temporal model. Second,
music is usually composed of multiple instruments/tracks with their own
temporal dynamics, but collectively they unfold over time interdependently.
Lastly, musical notes are often grouped into chords, arpeggios or melodies in
polyphonic music, and thereby introducing a chronological ordering of notes is
not naturally suitable. In this paper, we propose three models for symbolic
multi-track music generation under the framework of generative adversarial
networks (GANs). The three models, which differ in the underlying assumptions
and accordingly the network architectures, are referred to as the jamming
model, the composer model and the hybrid model. We trained the proposed models
on a dataset of over one hundred thousand bars of rock music and applied them
to generate piano-rolls of five tracks: bass, drums, guitar, piano and strings.
A few intra-track and inter-track objective metrics are also proposed to
evaluate the generative results, in addition to a subjective user study. We
show that our models can generate coherent music of four bars right from
scratch (i.e. without human inputs). We also extend our models to human-AI
cooperative music generation: given a specific track composed by human, we can
generate four additional tracks to accompany it. All code, the dataset and the
rendered audio samples are available at https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/ .

proposed in the context of programmable matter and self-assembly for building
high-yield micro-factories. The underlying model has particles moving under the
influence of uniform external forces until they hit an obstacle; particles can
bond when being forced together with another appropriate particle. Due to the
physical and geometric constraints, not all shapes can be built in this manner;
this gives rise to the Tilt Assembly Problem (TAP) of deciding
constructibility. For simply-connected polyominoes $P$ in 2D consisting of $N$
unit-squares (""tiles""), we prove that TAP can be decided in $O(N\log N)$ time.
For the optimization variant MaxTAP (in which the objective is to construct a
subshape of maximum possible size), we show polyAPX-hardness: unless P=NP,
MaxTAP cannot be approximated within a factor of $\Omega(N^{\frac{1}{3}})$; for
tree-shaped structures, we give an $O(N^{\frac{1}{2}})$-approximation
algorithm. For the efficiency of the assembly process itself, we show that any
constructible shape allows pipelined assembly, which produces copies of $P$ in
$O(1)$ amortized time, i.e., $N$ copies of $P$ in $O(N)$ time steps. These
considerations can be extended to three-dimensional objects: For the class of
polycubes $P$ we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether it is possible to
construct a path between two points of $P$; it is also NP-hard to decide
constructibility of a polycube $P$. Moreover, it is expAPX-hard to maximize a

external physical entities but are very much the product of our brains. Our
cortical machinery segments the world and associate objects to specific colour
terms, which is not only convenient for communication but also increases the
efficiency of visual processing by reducing the dimensionality of input scenes.
Although the neural substrate for this phenomenon is unknown, a recent study of
cortical colour processing has discovered a set of neurons that are
isoresponsive to stimuli in the shape of 3D-ellipsoidal surfaces in
colour-opponent space. We hypothesise that these neurons might help explain the
underlying mechanisms of colour naming in the visual cortex.
  Following this, we propose a biologically-inspired colour naming model where
each colour term - e.g. red, green, blue, yellow, etc. - is represented through
an ellipsoid in 3D colour-opponent space. This paradigm is also supported by
previous psychophysical colour categorisation experiments whose results
resemble such shapes. ""Belongingness"" of each pixel to different colour
categories is computed by a non-linear sigmoidal logistic function. The final
colour term for a given pixel is calculated by a maximum pooling mechanism. The
simplicity of our model allows its parameters to be learnt from a handful of
segmented images. It also offers a straightforward extension to include further
colour terms. Additionally, ellipsoids of proposed model can adapt to image
contents offering a dynamical solution in order to address phenomenon of colour
constancy. Our results on the Munsell chart and two datasets of real-world
images show an overall improvement comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms.

model and to present experimental validation of both models. For the model with
rigid contact, after developing the model of the articulated bodies in flight

normally attracted by objects, particularly moving objects or the moving parts
of objects. Accordingly, we propose an object-to-motion convolutional neural
network (OM-CNN) to learn spatio-temporal features for predicting the
intra-frame saliency via exploring the information of both objectness and
object motion. We further find from our database that there exists a temporal
correlation of human attention with a smooth saliency transition across video
frames. Therefore, we develop a two-layer convolutional long short-term memory
(2C-LSTM) network in our DNN-based method, using the extracted features of
OM-CNN as the input. Consequently, the inter-frame saliency maps of videos can
be generated, which consider the transition of attention across video frames.
Finally, the experimental results show that our method advances the
state-of-the-art in video saliency prediction.

years. Extracting opinion target expressions (OTE) in reviews is often an
important step in fine-grained, aspect-based sentiment analysis. Retrieving
this information from user-generated text, however, can be difficult. Customer
reviews, for instance, are prone to contain misspelled words and are difficult
to process due to their domain-specific language. In this work, we investigate
whether character-level models can improve the performance for the
identification of opinion target expressions. We integrate information about
the character structure of a word into a sequence labeling system using
character-level word embeddings and show their positive impact on the system's
performance. Specifically, we obtain an increase by 3.3 points F1-score with
respect to our baseline model. In further experiments, we reveal encoded
character patterns of the learned embeddings and give a nuanced view of the
performance differences of both models.

a formal notion of location privacy, generating a rich body of literature
building on this idea. A problem with most of these follow-up works is that
they blindly rely on geo-indistinguishability to provide location privacy,
ignoring the numerical interpretation of this privacy guarantee. In this paper,
we provide an alternative formulation of geo-indistinguishability as an
adversary error, and use it to show that the privacy vs.~utility trade-off that
can be obtained is not as appealing as implied by the literature. We also show
that although geo-indistinguishability guarantees a lower bound on the
adversary's error, this comes at the cost of achieving poorer performance than
other noise generation mechanisms in terms of average error, and enabling the
possibility of exposing obfuscated locations that are useless from the quality

underlying mechanism of the spin Seebeck effect, but also allows for the
extraction of the magnon relaxation length ($\lambda_m$) in a magnetic
material, the average distance over which thermal magnons can propagate. In
this study, we experimentally explore in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/platinum
systems much further ranges compared with previous investigations. We observe
that the nonlocal SSE signals at long distances ($d$) clearly deviate from a
typical exponential decay. Instead, they can be dominated by the nonlocal
generation of magnon accumulation as a result of the temperature gradient
present away from the heater, and decay geometrically as $1/d^2$. We emphasize
the importance of looking only into the exponential regime (i.e., the
intermediate distance regime) to extract $\lambda_m$. With this principle, we
study $\lambda_m$ as a function of temperature in two YIG films which are 2.7

$\mu$m at room temperature and it increases to 40 $\mu$m at $T=$ 3.5 K. Finite
element modeling results agree with experimental studies qualitatively, showing
also a geometrical decay beyond the exponential regime. Based on both
experimental and modeling results we put forward a general guideline for
extracting $\lambda_m$ from the nonlocal spin Seebeck effect.

bounce via an explicit evolution of states using numerical simulations, the
question about the way central singularity is resolved in the black hole
interior has remained open. The quantum Hamiltonian constraint in loop
quantization turns out to be a finite difference equation whose stability is
important to understand to gain insights on the viability of the underlying
quantization and resulting physical implications. We take first steps towards
addressing these issues for a loop quantization of the Schwarzschild interior
recently given by Corichi and Singh. Von-Neumann stability analysis is
performed using separability of solutions as well as a full two dimensional
quantum difference equation. This results in a stability condition for black
holes which have a very large mass compared to the Planck mass. For black holes
of smaller masses evidence of numerical instability is found. In addition,
stability analysis for macroscopic black holes leads to a constraint on the
choice of the allowed states in numerical evolution. With the caveat of using
kinematical norm, sharply peaked Gaussian states are evolved using the quantum
difference equation and singularity resolution is obtained. A bounce is found
for one of the triad variables, but for the other triad variable singularity
resolution amounts to a non-singular passage through the zero volume. States
are found to be peaked at the classical trajectory for a long time before and
after the singularity resolution, and retain their semi-classical character
across the zero volume. Our main result is that quantum bounce occurs in loop
quantized Schwarzschild interior at least for macroscopic black holes.

eigenfrequencies. These criteria include the depth, at which the replacement is
performed, the quantity, on which the replacement is based, and the mismatch in
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ and $\log g$ between the un-patched model and patched 3D
atmosphere. We find the eigenfrequencies to be unaltered by the patching depth
deep within the adiabatic region, while changing the patching quantity or the
employed atmosphere grid leads to frequency shifts that may exceed
$1\,\mu\mathrm{Hz}$. Likewise, the eigenfrequencies are sensitive to mismatches
in $T_\mathrm{eff}$ or $\log g$. A thorough investigation of the accuracy of a
new scheme, for interpolating mean 3D stratifications within the atmosphere
grids, is furthermore performed. Throughout large parts of the atmosphere
grids, our interpolation scheme yields sufficiently accurate results for the
purpose of asteroseismology. We apply our procedure in asteroseismic analyses

correction is slightly sensitive to the patching criteria, and the remaining
frequency discrepancy between models and observations is less

in asteroseismology.

self-generated chemical and thermal gradients, an in-situ change of swimming

demonstrate that the direction of motion can be reversibly switched by means of
the size and shape of the droplet(s) nucleated around the colloid, depending on
the particle radius and the fluid's ambient temperature. Moreover, the
aforementioned features enable the possibility to realize both negative and
positive phototaxis in light intensity gradients. Our results can be extended

alternatively reported period of either 25.4d or 27.8d and a third component in
a 62000d orbit. The object was also reported to exhibit multiperiodic light
variations with periods from 0.83d to 2.50d, on the basis of which it was
classified as a slowly pulsating B star. Interest in further investigation of
this system was raised by the detection of a variable magnetic field. Analysing
spectra from four instruments, earlier published radial velocities, and several
sets of photometric observations, we arrived at the following conclusions: (1)
The optical spectrum is dominated by the lines of the B-type primary
(Teff1~16500(100) K), contributing 70% of the light in the optical region, and
a slightly cooler B tertiary (Teff3~13620(150) K). The lines of the low-mass
secondary are below our detection threshold; we estimate that it could be a
normal A or F star. (2) We resolved the ambiguity in the value of the inner
binary period and arrived at a linear ephemeris of T_super.conj.=HJD
2443838.78(81)+25.41569(42)xE. (3) The intensity of the magnetic field
undergoes a~sinusoidal variation in phase with one of the known photometric
periods, namely 2.503867(19)d, which we identify with the rotational period of
the tertiary. (4) The second photometric 1.0649524(40)d period is identified
with the rotational period of the B-type primary, but this interpretation is
much less certain and needs further verification. (5) If our interpretation of
photometric periods is confirmed, the classification of the object as a slowly
pulsating B star should be revised. (6) Applying an N-body model to different
types of available observational data, we constrain the orbital inclination of
the inner orbit to ~60 deg to 85 deg even in the absence of eclipses, and
estimate the probable properties of the triple system and its components.

both subjective and objective methods for assessing quality loss in encoding
omnidirectional video. Specifically, we first present a new database, which
includes the viewing direction data from several subjects watching
omnidirectional video sequences. Then, from our database, we find a high
consistency in viewing directions across different subjects. The viewing
directions are normally distributed in the center of the front regions, but
they sometimes fall into other regions, related to video content. Given this
finding, we present a subjective VQA method for measuring difference mean
opinion score (DMOS) of the whole and regional omnidirectional video, in terms
of overall DMOS (O-DMOS) and vectorized DMOS (V-DMOS), respectively. Moreover,
we propose two objective VQA methods for encoded omnidirectional video, in
light of human perception characteristics of omnidirectional video. One method
weighs the distortion of pixels with regard to their distances to the center of
front regions, which considers human preference in a panorama. The other method
predicts viewing directions according to video content, and then the predicted
viewing directions are leveraged to allocate weights to the distortion of each
pixel in our objective VQA method. Finally, our experimental results verify
that both the subjective and objective methods proposed in this paper advance
state-of-the-art VQA for omnidirectional video.

dimensional structure, obtained from a localized perturbation of a reference
periodic medium. This reference medium is a ladder like domain, namely a thin
periodic structure (the thickness being characterized by a small parameter
$\epsilon > 0$) whose limit (as $\epsilon$ tends to 0) is a periodic graph. The
localized perturbation consists in changing the geometry of the reference
medium by modifying the thickness of one rung of the ladder. Considering the
scalar Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions in this domain, we
wonder whether such a geometrical perturbation is able to produce localized
eigenmodes. To address this question, we use a standard approach of asymptotic
analysis that consists of three main steps. We first find the formal limit of
the eigenvalue problem as the $\epsilon$ tends to 0. In the present case, it
corresponds to an eigenvalue problem for a second order differential operator
defined along the periodic graph. Then, we proceed to an explicit calculation
of the spectrum of the limit operator. Finally, we prove that the spectrum of
the initial operator is close to the spectrum of the limit operator. In
particular, we prove the existence of localized modes provided that the
geometrical perturbation consists in diminishing the width of one rung of the
periodic thin structure. Moreover, in that case, it is possible to create as
many eigenvalues as one wants, provided that $\epsilon$ is small enough.
Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.

present a new efficient method to carry out this reconstruction, which is based

numerical simulations of the quartic Galileon gravity model, which has similar
equations that can be solved effectively by multigrid Gauss-Seidel relaxation.
The method is based on mass conservation, and does not assume any specific

of state-of-the-art algorithms which were very recently put forward in the
literature, with the reconstructed density field over $\sim80\%$ ($50\%$)

oscillations (QPOs) at ~5-8 mHz, ~12-14 mHz, ~18-24 mHz frequencies at the
minimum confidence of 99%. However, during the consecutive binary decay phase,
no QPO is detected up to 2-sigma significance. Energy-dependent time-lag
spectra show soft lag (soft photons lag hard photons) at the mHz QPO frequency
and the fractional rms of the QPO increases with the photon energy. During the
binary motion, the observation of mHz QPOs during the rising phase of the
flaring hard state may be linked to the increase in the supply of the accreting
material in the disk and corona via stellar wind from the companion star.
During the decay phase, the compact source moves in the outer wind region
causing the decrease in the supply of material for accretion. This may cause
weakening of the mHz QPOs below the detection limit. This is also consistent
with the preliminary analysis of the orbital phase-resolved energy spectra
presented in this paper.

Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast Wave (BGBW) function is taken as an equilibrium function

two phases: the damped and the pure Newton phases. Compared to state-of-the-art
PDIP methods, our solver replaces the initial damped Newton phase (usually used
to compute a medium-accuracy solution) with a dual solver based on Nesterov's
fast gradient scheme (DFG) that converges with a sublinear convergence rate of
order O(1/k^2) to a medium-accuracy solution. The switching strategy to the
pure Newton phase, compared to the state of the art, is computed in the dual
space to exploit the dual information provided by the DFG in the first phase.
Removing the damped Newton phase has the additional advantage that our solver
saves the computational effort required by backtracking line search. The
effectiveness of the proposed solver is demonstrated on a 2-dimensional

which jobs correspond to self-interested users and machines correspond to
resources. Here each user chooses a machine trying to minimize her own cost,
and such selfish behavior typically results in some equilibrium which is not
globally optimal: An equilibrium is an allocation where no user can reduce her
own cost by moving to another machine, which in general need not minimize the
makespan, i.e., the maximum load over the machines.
  We provide tight bounds on two well-studied notions in algorithmic game
theory, namely, the price of anarchy and the strong price of anarchy on machine
scheduling setting which lies in between the related and the unrelated machine
case. Both notions study the social cost (makespan) of the worst equilibrium
compared to the optimum, with the strong price of anarchy restricting to a
stronger form of equilibria. Our results extend a prior study comparing the
price of anarchy to the strong price of anarchy for two related machines
(Epstein, Acta Informatica 2010), thus providing further insights on the
relation between these concepts. Our exact bounds give a qualitative and
quantitative comparison between the two models. The bounds also show that the
setting is indeed easier than the two unrelated machines: In the latter, the
strong price of anarchy is $2$, while in ours it is strictly smaller.

should settle to a steady condition: below a critical Reynolds number, flows
should (regardless of initial conditions) always return to laminar, while
above, eddying motion should persist. As shown, even in pipes several thousand
diameters long, the spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns observed at the
end of the pipe strongly depend on the initial conditions, with no indication
of an approach to a (statistical) steady state. Exploiting the fact that
turbulent puffs do not age, we continuously recreate the puff sequence exiting
the pipe at the entrance, thus introducing periodic boundary conditions for the
flow pattern. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the flow
patterns for arbitrary long times. We find that after times in excess of $10^7$
advective time units, a statistical steady state is reached. Though the
resulting flows remain spatio-temporally intermittent, puff splitting and decay
rates eventually reach a balance so that the turbulent fraction fluctuates
around a well defined level which only depends on $Re$. We find that at lower
$Re$ (here 2020), flows eventually always laminarize, while for higher $Re$
($>=2060$) turbulence persists. The critical point for pipe flow hence lies in
the interval $2020<Re_c<2060$, which is in good agreement with the recently
proposed value of $Re_c=2040$. The latter estimate was based on single puff
statistics and entirely neglected puff interactions. Unlike typical contact
processes where such interactions strongly affect the critical point, in pipe
flow it is only marginally influenced. Interactions on the other hand, are
responsible for the approach to the statistical steady state. As shown, they
strongly affect the resulting flow patterns, where they cause `puff

has provided unique observations of off-limb flare emission. White-light (WL)
continuum enhancements were detected in the ""continuum"" channel of the Fe 6173
A line during the impulsive phase of the observed flares. In this paper we aim
to determine which radiation mechanism is responsible for such an enhancement
being seen above the limb, at chromospheric heights around or below 1000 km.
Using a simple analytical approach, we compare two candidate mechanisms, the
hydrogen recombination continuum (Paschen) and the Thomson continuum due to
scattering of disk radiation on flare electrons. Both mechanisms depend on the
electron density, which is typically enhanced during the impulsive phase of a
flare as the result of collisional ionization (both thermal and also
non-thermal due to electron beams). We conclude that for electron densities
higher than $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the Paschen recombination continuum
significantly dominates the Thomson scattering continuum and there is some
contribution from the hydrogen free-free emission. This is further supported by
detailed radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations of the flare chromosphere
heated by the electron beams. We use the RHD code FLARIX to compute the
temporal evolution of the flare heating in a semi-circular loop. The
synthesized continuum structure above the limb resembles the off-limb flare
structures detected by HMI, namely their height above the limb, as well as the
radiation intensity. These results are consistent with recent findings related
to hydrogen Balmer continuum enhancements, which were clearly detected in disk
flares by the IRIS near-ultraviolet spectrometer.

evolution are highly sensitive to the uncertain treatment of mixing at
convective boundaries. In the last few years, interest in constraining the
uncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from
asteroseismology. Recently, Spruit (2015) proposed a limit for the rate of
growth of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher buoyancy of
material ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the
implications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass
and metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild
boundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning,
when core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest.
Ordinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime to
such an extent that models are at odds with observations of globular cluster
populations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses ($0.83 \leq
M/\text{M}_\odot \leq 5$), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core
helium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or
their number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore
helps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical
predictions. Specifically, we find improved agreement for $R_2$, the observed
ratio of asymptotic giant branch to horizontal branch stars in globular
clusters; the luminosity difference between these two groups; and in
asteroseismology, the mixed-mode period spacing detected in red clump stars in
the \textit{Kepler} field.

of a many-body system that can occur as a control parameter such as a
concentration or a field strength is varied. They are driven purely by the
competition between quantum fluctuations and mutual interactions among
constituents of the system, not by thermal fluctuations; hence they can occur
even at zero temperature. Examples of quantum phase transitions in many-body
physics may be found in systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors
to topological insulators. A quantum phase transition usually can be
characterized by nonanalyticity/discontinuity in certain order parameters or
divergence of the ground state energy eigenvalue and/or its derivatives with
respect to certain physical quantities. Here in a circular one-dimensional spin
model with Heisenberg XY interaction and no magnetic field, we observe critical
phenomena for the $n_0=1/N\rightarrow0$ Mott insulator caused by a qualitative
change of the boundary condition. We demonstrate in the vicinity of the
transition point a sudden change in ground-state properties accompanied by an

a labeled graph generated from a graph grammar. Non-terminal vertices represent
subcomponents, terminal vertices represent symbols, and edges represent
relations between subcomponents or symbols. We then model the recognition
problem as a graph parsing problem: given an input stroke set, we search for a
parse tree that represents the best interpretation of the input. Our graph
parsing algorithm generates multiple interpretations (consistent with the
grammar) and then we extract an optimal interpretation according to a cost
function that takes into consideration the likelihood scores of symbols and
structures. The parsing algorithm consists in recursively partitioning the
stroke set according to structures defined in the grammar and it does not
impose constraints present in some previous works (e.g. stroke ordering). By
avoiding such constraints and thanks to the powerful representativeness of
graphs, our approach can be adapted to the recognition of different graphic
notations. We show applications to the recognition of mathematical expressions

Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics of many-body interacting Hamiltonian systems, with an
emphasis on the effect of inter-particle interactions. To this end, we consider
a model system with both short- and long-range interactions. The Nos\'e-Hoover
dynamics aims to generate the canonical equilibrium distribution of a system at
a desired temperature by employing a set of time-reversible, deterministic
equations of motion. A signature of canonical equilibrium is a single-particle
momentum distribution that is Gaussian. We find that the equilibrium properties
of the system within the Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics coincides with that within the
canonical ensemble. Moreover, starting from out-of-equilibrium initial
conditions, the average kinetic energy of the system relaxes to its target
value over a {\it size-independent} timescale. However, quite surprisingly, our
results indicate that under the same conditions and with only long-range
interactions present in the system, the momentum distribution relaxes to its
Gaussian form in equilibrium over a scale that {\it diverges with the system
size}. On adding short-range interactions, the relaxation is found to occur
over a timescale that has a much weaker dependence on system size. This
system-size dependence of the timescale vanishes when only short-range
interactions are present in the system. An implication of such an ultra-slow
relaxation when only long-range interactions are present in the system is that
macroscopic observables other than the average kinetic energy when estimated in
the Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics may take an unusually long time to relax to its
canonical equilibrium value. Our work underlines the crucial role that
interactions play in deciding the equivalence between Nos\'e-Hoover and
canonical equilibrium.

high resistivity regions in favor of low resistivity regions, giving rise to
'conductive inhomogeneities'. Therefore, the total resistance of the spin valve
does not always correspond exactly to the total average magnetization of the

critical national infrastructure, are increasingly being connected to other
networks and the wider internet motivated by factors such as enhanced
operational functionality and improved efficiency. However, set in this
context, it is easy to see that the cyber attack surface of these systems is
expanding, making it more important than ever that innovative solutions for
securing ICS be developed and that the limitations of these solutions are well
understood. The development of anomaly based intrusion detection techniques has
provided capability for protecting ICS from the serious physical damage that
cyber breaches are capable of delivering to them by monitoring sensor and
control signals for abnormal activity. Recently, the use of so-called stealthy
attacks has been demonstrated where the injection of false sensor measurements
can be used to mimic normal control system signals, thereby defeating anomaly
detectors whilst still delivering attack objectives. In this paper we define a
deep learning-based framework which allows an attacker to conduct stealthy
attacks with minimal a-priori knowledge of the target ICS. Specifically, we
show that by intercepting the sensor and/or control signals in an ICS for a
period of time, a malicious program is able to automatically learn to generate
high-quality stealthy attacks which can achieve specific attack goals whilst
bypassing a black box anomaly detector. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework for conducting stealthy attacks using two
real-world ICS case studies. We contend that our results motivate greater
attention on this area by the security community as we demonstrate that
currently assumed barriers for the successful execution of such attacks are
relaxed.

missing in the literature. We include Newtonian plus dark halo gravity, and two
non-Newtonian gravity models, MOG and MOND, in identical initial systems. We
investigate the effect of dynamical friction, which by slowing down the dwarf
galaxy in the dark halo models limits the range of shell radii to low values.
Under the same initial conditions, shells appear on a shorter timescale and
over a smaller range of distances in the presence of dark matter than in the
corresponding non-Newtonian gravity models. If galaxies are embedded in a dark
matter halo, then the merging time may be too rapid to allow multi-generation
shell formation as required by observed systems because of the large dynamical
friction effect. Starting from the same initial state, in the dark halo model
the observation of small bright shells should be accompanied by large faint
ones, while for the case of MOG, the next shell generation patterns iterate
with a specific time delay. The first shell generation pattern shows a
degeneracy with the age of the shells and in different theories, but the
relative distance of the shells and the shell expansion velocity can break this

design for a quadrotor with variable-pitch propellers. The use of
variable-pitch propeller for thrust variation instead of RPM regulation
facilitates generation of negative thrust, thereby augmenting the rate of
change of thrust generation amenable for aggressive maneuvering. Blade element
theory along with momentum theory is used to estimate propeller thrust and
torque essential for formulating equation of motion of the vehicle. The
proposed flight dynamics model is used for non-linear control design using
dynamic inversion technique, which is then used to stabilize, track reference
trajectory, and simulate flip maneuver. The rotor torque is an irrational
function of the control input which makes the control design challenging. To
address this problem, the control design employs three loops. The outer loop
solves the translational dynamics to generate the thrust, pitch angle, and roll
angle commands required to track the prescribed trajectory. Using the command
generated in the outer loop, the inner loop simplifies the rotational dynamics
to provide the desired rate of angular velocities. A control allocation loop is
added to address the problem of nonlinearity associated with rotor torque. This
is done by introducing the derivative of thrust coefficient as a virtual
control input. These virtual inputs determine the derivatives of thrust and
body moments, which in turn is used to generate the required thrust and body
moments. The concept is validated by showing attitude stabilization in real
flight for a variable pitch quadrotor. The performance of the proposed design
is shown through simulated results for attitude stabilization and trajectory
following. Reverse thrust capability of variable-pitch quadrotor is also shown
by performing flip maneuver in which quadrotor roll angle changes from 0 to 180
degrees.

sequence-to-sequence neural attention network system for automatic text
correction and completion. Given an erroneous sequence, our model encodes
character level hidden representations and then decodes the revised sequence
thus enabling auto-correction and completion. We achieve this by a combination
of character level CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRU) encoder along with and a
word level gated recurrent unit (GRU) attention decoder. Unlike traditional
language models that learn from billions of words, our corpus size is only 12
million words; an order of magnitude smaller. The memory footprint of our
learnt model for inference and prediction is also an order of magnitude smaller
than the conventional language model based text decoders. We report baseline
performance for neural keyboard decoders in such limited domain. Our models
achieve a word level accuracy of $90\%$ and a character error rate CER of
$2.4\%$ over the Twitter typo dataset. We present a novel dataset of noisy to
corrected mappings by inducing the noise distribution from the Twitter data
over the OpenSubtitles 2009 dataset; on which our model predicts with a word
level accuracy of $98\%$ and sequence accuracy of $68.9\%$. In our user study,
our model achieved an average CER of $2.6\%$ with the state-of-the-art
non-neural touch-screen keyboard decoder at CER of $1.6\%$.

high velocity jet and knots, it is a rather atypical representative of this
class. We performed multi-wavelength observations spreading from the optical to
the radio regime. Based on optical imaging and long-slit spectroscopic data we
found that the northern parts of the large-scale nebula are predominantly
blue-shifted, while the southern regions appear mostly red-shifted. We
developed a geometrical model consisting of two double-cones. While various
observational features can be approximated with such a scenario, the observed
velocity pattern is more complex. Using near-infrared integral-field unit
spectroscopy we studied the hot molecular gas in the close vicinity of the
star. The emission from the hot CO gas arises in a small-scale disk revolving
around the star on Keplerian orbits. While the disk itself cannot be spatially
resolved, its emission is reflected by dust arranged in arc-like structures and
clumps surrounding MWC 137 on small scales. In the radio regime we mapped the
cold molecular gas in the outskirts of the optical nebula. We found that large
amounts of cool molecular gas and warm dust embrace the optical nebula in the
east, south and west. No cold gas or dust were detected in the north and
north-western regions. Despite the new insights on the nebula kinematics gained
from our studies, the real formation scenario of the large-scale nebula remains
an open issue.

It is theoretically possible for rings to have formed around
extrasolar planets in a similar way to that in which they formed around the
giant planets in our solar system. However, no such rings have been detected to
date.
  AIMS: We aim to test the possibility of detecting rings around exoplanets by
investigating the photometric and spectroscopic ring signatures in
high-precision transit signals.
  METHODS: The photometric and spectroscopic transit signals of a ringed planet
is expected to show deviations from that of a spherical planet. We used these
deviations to quantify the detectability of rings. We present SOAP3.0 which is
a numerical tool to simulate ringed planet transits and measure ring
detectability based on amplitudes of the residuals between the ringed planet
signal and best fit ringless model.
  RESULTS: We find that it is possible to detect the photometric and
spectroscopic signature of near edge-on rings especially around planets with
high impact parameter. Time resolution $\leq$ 7 mins is required for the
photometric detection, while 15 mins is sufficient for the spectroscopic
detection. We also show that future instruments like CHEOPS and ESPRESSO, with
precisions that allow ring signatures to be well above their noise-level,
present good prospects for detecting rings.

outlier detection problem, support-based clustering has recently drawn plenty
of attention. Support-based clustering method always undergoes two phases:
finding the domain of novelty and performing clustering assignment. To find the
domain of novelty, the training time given by the current solvers is typically
over-quadratic in the training size, and hence precluding the usage of
support-based clustering method for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we
propose applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework to the first phase
of support-based clustering for finding the domain of novelty and a new
strategy to perform the clustering assignment. However, the direct application
of SGD to the first phase of support-based clustering is vulnerable to the
curse of kernelization, that is, the model size linearly grows up with the data
size accumulated overtime. To address this issue, we invoke the budget approach
which allows us to restrict the model size to a small budget. Our new strategy
for clustering assignment enables a fast computation by means of reducing the
task of clustering assignment on the full training set to the same task on a
significantly smaller set. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
about the convergence rate for the proposed method. Finally, we validate our
proposed method on the well-known datasets for clustering to show that the
proposed method offers a comparable clustering quality while simultaneously
achieving significant speedup in comparison with the baselines.

provides robustness to outliers (such as noise or missing data) by modeling the
conditional distribution of the privileged information by a Student's

with the system NanEye Stereo manufactured by CMOSIS/AWAIBA. These stereo

we defined a baseline method based on available software and methods, such as

out a new lower bound for the chromatic number of graphs. He showed that if the
hom complex $||Hom(\mathcal{K}_2, H)||$ of a graph $H$ is topologically
$k$-connected, then its chromatic number, $\chi (H)$, is at least $k+3$. After
that, he made the following conjecture, to provide a better lower bound on the
chromatic number of graphs. If $||Hom(C_{2r+1}, H)||$ is $k$-connected, then
$\chi (H)\geq k+4$, where $C_{2r+1}$ is an odd cycle of length $2r+1$. Finally,
Bj\""{o}rner and Lov\'{a}sz proposed a generalization of the Lov\'{a}sz
conjecture as follows. If $||Hom(T, H)||$ is $k$-connected, then $\chi (H)\geq
k+\chi (T) +1$. The first conjecture was originally confirmed by Babson and
Kozlov, by complicated computations with spectral sequences. But the second one
was disproved by Hoory and Linial. So, after that, a graph $T$ is called a test
graph if for every graph $H$, the $k$-connectedness of $||Hom(T, H)||$ implies
$\chi (H)\geq k + 1 + \chi(H)$.
  In this paper, we prove that if a graph $F$ possess an involutive
automorphism that flips some edge; then it is a test graph. As a corollary, we
give a purely combinatorial proof of the Lov\'{a}sz conjecture; odd cycles are
test graphs. Indeed, although the Bj\""{o}rner and Lov\'{a}sz conjecture is not
true in general, we show that a slight modification of the conjecture is always
true. More precisely, we show that for any graph $T$, there is a supergraph
$T\subseteq\hat{T}$ with $\chi(\hat{T})\leq\chi(T)+1$, such that $\hat{T}$ is a
test graph.

isothermal no-slip top and bottom boundaries (at temperatures $T_t$ and $T_b$)
via direct numerical simulation. The thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid
is temperature dependent and chosen such that the fluid density is maximum at
the inversion temperature $T_b>T_i>T_t$. Thus, the lower layer of the fluid is
convectively unstable while the upper layer is stably stratified. We show that
the characteristics of the convection change significantly depending on the
degree of stratification of the stable layer. For strong stable stratification,
the convection zone coincides with the fraction of the fluid that is
convectively unstable (i.e. where $T>T_i$), and convective motions consist of
rising and sinking plumes of large density anomaly, as is the case in canonical
Rayleigh-Benard convection; internal gravity waves are generated by turbulent
fluctuations in the convective layer and propagate in the upper layer. For weak
stable stratification, we demonstrate that a large fraction of the stable fluid
(i.e. with temperature $T<T_i$) is instead destabilized and entrained by
buoyant plumes emitted from the bottom boundary. The convection thus mixes cold
patches of low density-anomaly fluid with hot upward plumes, and the end result
is that the $T_i$ isotherm sinks within the bottom boundary layer and that the
convection is entrainment-dominated. We provide a phenomenological description
of the transition between the regimes of plume-dominated and
entrainment-dominated convection through analysis of quantities for different
stratification strengths. We find that the effect of the stable layer on the
convection decreases only weakly with increasing stratification strength,
meaning that the dynamics of the stable layer and convection should be studied
self-consistently in a wide range of applications.

represented by a parameter $d$. The athletes interact through the choice of
their strategies $x,y\in[0,1]$. These variables denote the amount of energy
each invests in the competition, and determine the performance of each athlete.
Each athlete picks his strategy based on his knowledge of his own and his
competitor's performance distribution, and on his evaluation of the danger of
exhaustion, which increases with the amount of invested energy. We formulate
this problem as a zero-sum game. Mathematically it is in the class of
""discontinuous games"" for which a Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed in
advance. We demonstrate by explicit construction that the problem has a mixed
strategy Nash equilibrium $\big( f(x),g(y) \big)$ for arbitrary $0<d<1$. The
probability distributions $f$ and $g$ appear to both be the sum of a continuous
component and a Dirac delta peak. It is remarkable that this problem is
analytically tractable. The Nash equilibrium provides both the weaker and the
stronger athlete with the best strategy to optimize their chances to win.

opinion dynamics. Our objective was to study how disease risk perception can
influence opinions about vaccination and therefore the spreading of the
disease. Differently from previous works we have considered continuous
opinions. The epidemic spreading is governed by a SIS-like model with an extra
vaccinated state. In our model individuals vaccinate with a probability
proportional to their opinions. The opinions change due to peer influence in
pairwise interactions. The epidemic feedback to the opinion dynamics acts as an
external field increasing the vaccination probability. We performed Monte Carlo
simulations in fully-connected populations. Interestingly we observed the
emergence of a first-order phase transition, besides the usual active-absorbing
phase transition presented in the SIS model. Our simulations also show that
with a certain combination of parameters, an increment in the initial fraction
of the population that is pro-vaccine has a twofold effect: it can lead to
smaller epidemic outbreaks in the short term, but it also contributes to the
survival of the chain of infections in the long term. Our results also suggest
that it is possible that more effective vaccines can decrease the long-term
vaccine coverage. This is a counterintuitive outcome, but it is in line with
empirical observations that vaccines can become a victim of their own success.

with capacity of $M$ files. The goal is to design a static content placement
and delivery scheme such that the average load over the shared link is
minimized. We first present a class of centralized coded caching schemes
consisting of a general content placement strategy specified by a file
partition parameter, enabling efficient and flexible content placement, and a
specific content delivery strategy, enabling load reduction by exploiting
common requests of different users. For the proposed class of schemes, we
consider two cases for the optimization of the file partition parameter,
depending on whether a large subpacketization level is allowed or not. In the
case of an unrestricted subpacketization level, we formulate the coded caching
optimization in order to minimize the average load under an arbitrary file
popularity. A direct formulation of the problem involves $N2^K$ variables. By
imposing some additional conditions, the problem is reduced to a linear program
with $N(K+1)$ variables under an arbitrary file popularity and with $K+1$
variables under the uniform file popularity. We can recover Yu {\em et al.}'s
optimal scheme for the uniform file popularity as an optimal solution of our
problem. When a low subpacketization level is desired, we introduce a
subpacketization level constraint involving the $\ell_0$ norm for each file.
Again, by imposing the same additional conditions, we can simplify the problem
to a difference of two convex functions (DC) problem with $N(K+1)$ variables

evolution of astrometric accuracy towards a much improved situation. Although
asteroids are not present in GDR1, this intermediate release already impacts
asteroid astrometry. Our goal is to investigate how the GDR1 can change the
approach to a few typical problems, including the determination of orbits from
short-arc astrometry, the exploitation of stellar occultations, and the impact
risk assessment. We employ optimised asteroid orbit determination tools, and
study the resulting orbit accuracy and post-fit residuals. For this goal, we
use selected ground-based asteroid astrometry, and occultation events observed
in the past. All measurements are calibrated by using GDR1 stars. We show that,
by adopting GDR1, very short measurement arcs can already provide interesting
orbital solutions, capable of correctly identifying Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs)
and providing a much more accurate risk rating. We also demonstrate that
occultations, previously used to derive asteroid size and shapes, now reach a
new level of accuracy at which they can be fruitfully used to obtain astrometry
at the level of accuracy of Gaia star positions.

along which various spacetime curvature invariants blow up, only to re-collapse
in a symmetric fashion in the future (the Big Crunch). In this article, we give
a complete description of the maximal developments of perturbations of the FLRW
data at the chronological midpoint of its evolution. We show that the perturbed
solutions also exhibit curvature blowup along a pair of spacelike
hypersurfaces, signifying the stability of the Big Bang and the Big Crunch.
Moreover, we provide a sharp description of the asymptotic behavior of the

singular hypersurfaces that are close to the corresponding FLRW tensorfields.
Our proof crucially relies on $L^2$-type approximate monotonicity identities in
the spirit of the ones we used in our joint works with Rodnianski, in which we
proved similar results for nearly spatially flat solutions with spatial

handle nearly round spatial metrics on $\mathbb{S}^3$, whose curvatures are
order-unity near the initial data hypersurface. In particular, our proof relies
on i) the construction of a globally defined spatial vectorfield frame adapted
to the symmetries of a round metric on $\mathbb{S}^3$; ii) estimates for the
Lie derivatives of various geometric quantities with respect to the elements of
the frame; and iii) sharp estimates for the asymptotic behavior of the FLRW

long-range interactions, which lead to dense matrices. Both of these settings
show very different computational characteristics. We use Magnus integrators
for time integration and employ a framework based on Leja interpolation to
compute the resulting action of the matrix exponential. We consider both
traditional Magnus integrators (which are extensively used for these types of

Magnus integrators and implement them on modern CPU and GPU (graphics

  We find that GPUs can yield a significant speed-up (up to a factor of $10$ in
the dense case) for these types of problems. In the sparse case GPUs are only
advantageous for large problem sizes and the achieved speed-ups are more
modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on
the GPU this advantage is rather small. In fact, none of the advantage of
commutator-free methods on GPUs (and on multi-core CPUs) is due to the
elimination of commutators. This has important consequences for the design of
more efficient numerical methods.

The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP
heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its

  for Improving Sequence Memorization",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning to remember long sequences remains a challenging task for recurrent
neural networks. Register memory and attention mechanisms were both proposed to
resolve the issue with either high computational cost to retain memory
differentiability, or by discounting the RNN representation learning towards
encoding shorter local contexts than encouraging long sequence encoding.
Associative memory, which studies the compression of multiple patterns in a
fixed size memory, were rarely considered in recent years. Although some recent
work tries to introduce associative memory in RNN and mimic the energy decay
process in Hopfield nets, it inherits the shortcoming of rule-based memory
updates, and the memory capacity is limited. This paper proposes a method to
learn the memory update rule jointly with task objective to improve memory
capacity for remembering long sequences. Also, we propose an architecture that
uses multiple such associative memory for more complex input encoding. We
observed some interesting facts when compared to other RNN architectures on
some well-studied sequence learning tasks.

long short-term memory, after all the input video frames are processed, is used

show that our method outperforms the state of the art on most recent first

graphene and the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 $XY$ model in a transverse field
in the presence of periodic time-varying terms in their Hamiltonians in the low
drive frequency ($\omega$) regime where standard $1/\omega$ perturbative
expansions fail. For graphene, such periodic time dependent terms are generated
via the application of external radiation of amplitude $A_0$ and time period $T
= 2\pi/\omega$, while for the 1D $XY$ model, they result from a two-rate drive
protocol with time-dependent magnetic field and nearest-neighbor couplings
between the spins. Using the adiabatic-impulse method, we provide several
semi-analytic criteria for the occurrence of changes in the topology of the
phase bands of such systems. For irradiated graphene, we point out the role of
the symmetries of $H(t)$ and $U$ behind such topology changes. Our analysis
reveals that at low frequencies, phase band topology changes may also happen at
$t= T/3, 2T/3$ (apart from $t=T$). We chart out the phase diagrams at $t=T/3,
2T/3,\, {\rm and }\, T$ as a function of $A_0$ and $T$ using exact numerics,

that several characteristics of these phase diagrams can be analytically
understood from results obtained using the adiabatic-impulse method and point
out the crucial contribution of the high-symmetry points in the graphene
Brillouin zone to these diagrams. Finally we study the 1D $XY$ model with a
two-rate driving protocol using the adiabatic-impulse method and exact numerics
revealing a phase band crossing at $t=T/2$ and $k=\pi/2$. We also study the
anomalous end modes generated by such a drive. We suggest experiments to test

an excellent correlation with indices like the Kp/Ap index. The two networks

commutation relations $[p_{i},p_{j}]\left( \neq 0\right) $ depend on products

noncommutativity leads to a rotation operator and the amount of the rotation is
an angle anholonomy; and along each of the \textit{normal sectional curves}

quality of each raw image usually depends on the visual assessments, which is
subjective and inaccurate especially for those dark field images. Moreover, the
acquisition process is really time-consuming.In this paper, we propose a

Further combined with the sparse LEDs strategy, the number of collection images

essential in environmental applications of reactive transport modelling. This
quantity evolves with microstructures and is difficult to predict because the
mechanisms for the generation and destruction of reactive surface remain
elusive. The challenge of accounting for the inherent heterogeneities of
natural porous media in numerical simulation further complicates the problem.
Here we first show a direct observation of reactive surface generation in chalk
under circumneutral to alkaline pH using in situ X-ray microtomography. The
momentary increase of reactive surface area cannot be explained by a change in
fluid accessibility or by surface roughening stemming from mineralogical
heterogeneity. We then combine greyscale nanotomography data with numerical
simulations to show that similar temporal behaviour can be observed over a wide
range of pH as porous media dissolve in imposed flow field. We attribute the
observation to the coupling between fluid flow and mineral dissolution and
argue that the extent of surface generation is strongly correlated with the
advective penetration depth of reactants. To conclude, we demonstrate the
applicability of using a macroscopic Damk\""ohler number as an indicator for the
phenomenon and discuss its environmental significance beyond geologic carbon
storage.

application of en- ergy balance reveals that the total energy of the system
fluctuates even though the oscillations are small and bounded in time,

silicon-based inphase/quadrature (IQ) modulators at symbol rates of up to 100
GBd. Our devices exploit the advantages of silicon-organic hybrid (SOH)
integration, which combines silicon-on-insulator waveguides with highly
efficient organic electro-optic (EO) cladding materials to enable small drive
voltages and sub-millimeter device lengths. In our experiments, we use an SOH
IQ modulator with a {\pi}-voltage of 1.6 V to generate 100 GBd 16QAM signals.
This is the first time that the 100 GBd mark is reached with an IQ modulator
realized on a semiconductor substrate, leading to a single-polarization line
rate of 400 Gbit/s. The peak-to-peak drive voltages amount to 1.5 Vpp,
corresponding to an electrical energy dissipation in the modulator of only 25
fJ/bit.

will have an unprecedented impact on applications ranging from unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) to mobile phones. To address this demand, silicon photonics
stands out as a platform capable of delivering compact and cost-effective
devices. The Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is largely used in free-space
spectroscopy, and its implementation in silicon photonics will contribute to
bringing broadband operation and fine resolution to the chip scale. The
implementation of an integrated silicon photonics FTS (Si-FTS) must nonetheless
take into account effects such as waveguide dispersion and non-linearity of
refractive index tuning mechanisms. Here we present the modeling and
experimental demonstration of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) Si-FTS with
integrated microheaters. We show how the power spectral density (PSD) of a
light source and the interferogram measured with the Si-FTS can be related
through a simple Fourier transform (FT), provided the optical frequency and
time delay are corrected to account for dispersion, thermo-optic non-linearity
and thermal expansion. We calibrate the Si-FTS, including the correction
parameters, using a tunable laser source and we successfully retrieve the PSD
of a broadband source. The aforementioned effects are shown to effectively
enhance the Si-FTS resolution when properly accounted for. Finally, we discuss
the Si-FTS resilience to chip-scale fabrication variations, a major advantage
for large-scale manufacturing. Providing design flexibility and robustness, the
Si-FTS is poised to become a fundamental building-block for on-chip
spectroscopy

current grid-tied fixed array 6.84kW solar photovoltaic system located at
Florida Atlantic University (FAU). A battery energy storage system is designed
and applied to improve the systems stability and reliability. An overview of
the entire system and its PV module are presented. In sequel, the corresponding
I-V and P-V curves are obtained using MATLAB-Simulink package. Actual data was
collected and utilized for the modeling and simulation of the system. In
addition, a grid- connected PV/Battery system with Maximum Power Point Tracking
(MPPT) controller is modeled to analyze the system performance that has been
evaluated under two different test conditions: (1) PV power production is
higher than the load demand (2) PV generated power is less than required load.
A battery system has also been sized to provide smoothing services to this
array. The simulation results show the effective of the proposed method. This
system can be implemented in developing countries with similar weather
conditions to Florida.

condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and quantum chemistry. We propose a
novel method to deduce the energy density functional by combining the idea of
the functional renormalization group and the Kohn-Sham scheme in density
functional theory. The key idea is to solve the renormalization group flow for
the effective action decomposed into the mean-field part and the correlation
part. Also, we propose a simple practical method to quantify the uncertainty
associated with the truncation of the correlation part. By taking the
$\varphi^4$ theory in zero dimension as a benchmark, we demonstrate that our
method shows extremely fast convergence to the exact result even for the highly
strong coupling regime.

proceeding H.264 standard but at the expense of extremely high encoding
complexity. In HEVC, the quad-tree partition of coding unit (CU) consumes a
large proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity, due to the bruteforce search
for rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, this paper proposes a deep
learning approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity
at both intra- and inter-modes, which is based on convolutional neural network
(CNN) and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network. First, we establish a
large-scale database including substantial CU partition data for HEVC intra-
and inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second, we
represent the CU partition of an entire coding tree unit (CTU) in the form of a
hierarchical CU partition map (HCPM). Then, we propose an early-terminated
hierarchical CNN (ETH-CNN) for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently, the
encoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing
the brute-force search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third, an
early-terminated hierarchical LSTM (ETH-LSTM) is proposed to learn the temporal
correlation of the CU partition. Then, we combine ETH-LSTM and ETH-CNN to
predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity for inter-mode.
Finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art approaches in reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra- and
inter-modes.

a safe state possible upon detection of an error. The time and energy overhead
of checkpointing, however, grows with the frequency of checkpointing.
Amortizing this overhead becomes especially challenging, considering the growth
of expected error rates, as checkpointing frequency tends to increase with
increasing error rates. Based on the observation that due to imbalanced
technology scaling, recomputing a data value can be more energy efficient than
retrieving (i.e., loading) a stored copy, this paper explores how recomputation
of data values (which otherwise would be read from a checkpoint from memory or
secondary storage) can reduce the machine state to be checkpointed, and thereby
reduce the checkpointing overhead. Specifically, the resulting amnesic
checkpointing framework AmnesiCHK can reduce the storage overhead by up to
23.91%; time overhead, by 11.92%; and energy overhead, by 12.53%, respectively,
even in a relatively small scale system.
