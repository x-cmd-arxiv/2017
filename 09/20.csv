bracket the true evolution, and allow us to separately explore the role of
dynamical friction and that of multi-body BH interactions on BH mergers. Using
the computed merger rates, we infer the stochastic gravitational wave
background (GWB). Our dynamical approach is a first attempt to study the
dynamical evolution of multiple SMBHs in the host galaxies undergoing mergers
with various mass ratios ($10^{-4} < q_{\star} < 1$). Our main result
demonstrates that SMBH binaries are able to merge in both scenarios. In the
empty loss cone case, we find that BHs merge via multi-body interactions,
avoiding the `final parsec' problem, and entering the PTA band with substantial
orbital eccentricity. Our full loss cone treatment, albeit more approximate,
suggests that the eccentricity becomes even higher when GWs become dominant,
leading to rapid coalescences (binary lifetime $\lesssim1 {\rm ~Gyr}$). Despite
the lower merger rates in the empty loss cone case, due to their higher mass
ratios and lower redshifts, the GWB in the full/empty loss cone models are
comparable ($0.70\times10^{-15}$ and $0.53\times10^{-15}$ at a frequency of
$1~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively). Finally, we compute the effects of high
eccentricities on the GWB spectrum.

followed by a quenching phase, while only a minority of the most massive

Our aim is to improve our knowledge on the content and distribution of ionized

the Virgo cluster) that are representative of the whole ATLAS3D survey.
Fifty-five ETGs (37%) were detected in the Halpha line above our detection
threshold, (Halpha E.W. <= -1 AA), and 21 harbor a strong source (Halpha E.W.
<=-5 AA). The strong Halpha emitters appear associated with low-mass (M 10^10

harbor significant star formation at their interior, including their nuclei.
The weak Halpha emitters are almost one order of magnitude more massive,
contain gas-poor discs and harbor an AGN at their centers. Their emissivity is
dominated by [NII] and does not imply star formation. The 92 undetected ETGs
are gas-free systems that lack a disc and exhibit passive spectra even in their
nuclei. These pieces of evidence reinforce the conclusion that the evolution of
ETGs followed the secular channel for the less massive systems and the dry
merging channel for the most massive galaxies.

deprives the torsion of its dynamical content. The Lagrangian of {\sf ECKS}
gravity is proportional to the Ricci curvature scalar constructed out of a

vanishes and the theory reduces to {\sf GR}. It is however possible to have
torsion propagation in vacuum by resorting to a model endowed with a
non-minimal coupling between curvature and torsion. In the present work we try
to investigate possible effects of the higher order terms that can be
constructed from spacetime curvature and torsion, as the two basic constituents
of Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider Lagrangians that include fourth-order

  spherical space",,,,,"math.PR math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Euclidean space, the asymptotic shape of large cells in various types of
Poisson driven random tessellations has been the subject of a famous conjecture
due to David Kendall. Since shape is a geometric concept and large cells are
identified by means of geometric size functionals, the resolution of the
conjecture is inevitably connected with geometric inequalities of isoperimetric
type and their improvements in the form of geometric stability results,
relating geometric size functionals and hitting functionals. The latter are
deterministic characteristics of the underlying random tessellation. The
current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in
spherical space. A key ingredient of our approach are new geometric
inequalities and quantitative strengthenings in terms of stability results for
quite general and some specific size and hitting functionals of spherically
convex bodies. As a consequence we obtain probabilistic deviation inequalities
and asymptotic distributions of quite general size functionals. In contrast to
the Euclidean setting, where the asymptotic regime concerns large size, in the
spherical framework the asymptotic analysis is concerned with high intensities.

improvement is now well enough compared to high resolution adaptive

proposed to integrate the EIBMV inside the DMAS formula by replacing the

shown that EIBMV-DMAS outperforms DMAS in the terms of levels of sidelobes and
width of mainlobe significantly. For instance, at the depth of 35 mm,
EIBMV-DMAS outperforms DMAS and EIBMV in the term of sidelobes for about 108
dB, 98 dB and 44 dB compared to DAS, DMAS, and EIBMV, respectively. The
quantitative comparison has been conducted using Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM)

to solving a graph-structured combinatorial optimization problem. Popular
inference algorithms such as belief propagation (BP) and generalized belief
propagation (GBP) are intimately related to linear programming (LP) relaxation
within the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. Despite the popularity of these algorithms,
it is well understood that the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy based on
semidefinite programming (SDP) can provide superior guarantees. Unfortunately,
SOS relaxations for a graph with $n$ vertices require solving an SDP with
$n^{\Theta(d)}$ variables where $d$ is the degree in the hierarchy. In
practice, for $d\ge 4$, this approach does not scale beyond a few tens of
variables. In this paper, we propose binary SDP relaxations for MAP inference
using the SOS hierarchy with two innovations focused on computational
efficiency. Firstly, in analogy to BP and its variants, we only introduce
decision variables corresponding to contiguous regions in the graphical model.
Secondly, we solve the resulting SDP using a non-convex Burer-Monteiro style
method, and develop a sequential rounding procedure. We demonstrate that the
resulting algorithm can solve problems with tens of thousands of variables
within minutes, and outperforms BP and GBP on practical problems such as image
denoising and Ising spin glasses. Finally, for specific graph types, we
establish a sufficient condition for the tightness of the proposed partial SOS
relaxation.

namely, the representation of the electronic states in terms of symmetric,
exponentially localized Wannier functions. Here, we address the converse
question: Do obstructions to Wannier representation imply stable band topology?
We answer this in the negative, pointing out that some bands can also display a
distinct type of ""fragile topology."" Bands with fragile topology do not admit
any Wannier representation by themselves, but such a representation becomes
possible once certain additional trivial degrees of freedom are supplied. We
construct a physical model of fragile topology on the honeycomb lattice that
also helps resolve a recent puzzle in band theory. This model provides a
counterexample to the assumption that splitting of an ""elementary band
representation"" introduced in [Nature 547, 298--305 (2017)] leads to bands that
are individually topological. Instead, half of the split bands of our model
realizes a trivial band with exponentially localized symmetric Wannier
functions, whereas the second half possess fragile topology. Our work
highlights an important and previously overlooked connection between band
structure and Wannier functions, and is expected to have far reaching
consequences given the central role played by Wannier functions in the modeling

emerged in the recent picture of the top-down multiphase condensation, the hot
gaseous halos are tightly linked to all other phases in terms of cospatiality
and thermodynamics. While hot halos (10^7 K) are perturbed by subsonic
turbulence, warm (10^4 K) ionized and neutral filaments condense out of the
turbulent eddies. The peaks condense into cold molecular clouds (< 100 K)
raining in the core via chaotic cold accretion (CCA). We show all phases are
tightly linked via the ensemble (wide-aperture) velocity dispersion along the
line of sight. The correlation arises in complementary long-term AGN feedback
simulations and high-resolution CCA runs, and is corroborated by the combined
Hitomi and new IFU measurements in Perseus cluster. The ensemble multiphase gas
distributions are characterized by substantial spectral line broadening
(100-200 km/s) with mild line shift. On the other hand, pencil-beam detections
sample the small-scale clouds displaying smaller broadening and significant
line shift up to several 100 km/s, with increased scatter due to the turbulence
intermittency. We present new ensemble sigma_v of the warm Halpha+[NII] gas in
72 observed cluster/group cores: the constraints are consistent with the
simulations and can be used as robust proxies for the turbulent velocities, in
particular for the challenging hot plasma (otherwise requiring extremely long
X-ray exposures). We show the physically motivated criterion C = t_cool/t_eddy
~ 1 best traces the condensation extent region and presence of multiphase gas
in observed clusters/groups. The ensemble method can be applied to many
available datasets and can substantially advance our understanding of
multiphase halos in light of the next-generation multiwavelength missions.

marginal (< ~0.5% per band) variability with no clear spectral dependence,
while 2MASS J1821+1414 varies by up to +/-1.5% at 0.9 um, with the variability
amplitude declining toward longer wavelengths. The latter result extends the

to collapse to black holes, we characterize the failed fraction by considering
a threshold compactness above which massive stars collapse to black holes and

line-emission at high spatial resolution matched to the HST/WFC3 imaging. CR7
is a luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=6.6$ that consists of three
separated UV-continuum components. Our observations reveal several
well-separated components of [CII] emission. The two most luminous components
in [CII] coincide with the brightest UV components (A and B), blue-shifted by
$\approx 150$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the peak of Ly$\alpha$ emission.
Other [CII] components are observed close to UV clumps B and C and are
blue-shifted by $\approx300$ and $\approx80$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the
systemic redshift. We do not detect FIR continuum emission due to dust with a
3$\sigma$ limiting luminosity L$_{\rm IR} (T_d = 35 \rm \, K) <
3.1\times10^{10}$ L$_{\odot}$. This allows us to mitigate uncertainties in the
dust-corrected SFR and derive SFRs for the three UV clumps A, B and C of 28, 5

within the scatter observed in the local relation between SFR and L$_{\rm
[CII]}$, implying that strong Ly$\alpha$ emission does not necessarily
anti-correlate with [CII] luminosity. Combining our measurements with the
literature, we show that galaxies with blue UV slopes have weaker [CII]
emission at fixed SFR, potentially due to their lower metallicities and/or
higher photoionisation. Comparison with hydrodynamical simulations suggests
that CR7's clumps have metallicities of $0.1<\rm Z/Z_{\odot}<0.2$. The observed
ISM structure of CR7 indicates that we are likely witnessing the build up of a
central galaxy in the early Universe through complex accretion of satellites.

parametric models are consistent at the 1% level. At radii larger than
$\sim$6"", the agreement between Chandra and XMM is better than 1%, confirming
an excellent understanding of the XMM PSF. We find no significant energy
dependence. The impact of the well-known offset between Chandra and XMM gas
temperature determinations on the density profiles is found to be negligible.
However, we find an overall normalisation offset in density profiles of the
order of $\sim$2.5%, which is linked to absolute flux cross-calibration issues.
As a final result, the weighted ratios of Chandra to XMM gas masses computed at

Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) showcasing intense ionised Fe K absorption. We
present here the analysis of 11 XMM-Newton and 15 NuSTAR new data-sets
(obtained between 2013-2016), therefore tripling the number of observations of
AX J1745.6-2901 in outburst. Thanks to simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR
spectra, we greatly improve on the fitting of the X-ray continuum. During the
soft state the emission can be described by a disk black body ($kT\sim1.1-1.2$
keV and inner disc radius $r_{DBB}\sim14$ km), plus hot ($kT\sim2.2-3.0$ keV)
black body radiation with a small emitting radius ($r_{BB}\sim0.5-0.8$ km)
likely associated with the boundary layer or NS surface, plus a faint
Comptonisation component. Imprinted on the spectra are clear absorption
features created by both neutral and ionised matter. Additionally, positive
residuals suggestive of an emission Fe K$\alpha$ disc line and consistent with
relativistic ionised reflection are present during the soft state, while such
residuals are not significant during the hard state. The hard state spectra are
characterised by a hard ($\Gamma\sim1.9-2.1$) power law, showing no evidence
for a high energy cut off ($kT_e>60-140$ keV) and implying a small optical
depth ($\tau<1.6$). The new observations confirm the previously witnessed trend
of exhibiting strong Fe K absorption in the soft state, that significantly
weakens during the hard state. Optical (GROND) and radio (GMRT) observations
suggest for AX J1745.6-2901 a standard broad band SED as typically observed in
accreting neutron stars.

calculations for the SSA22 protocluster. We find $\delta_{b,gal}=4.8 \pm 1.8$,
$\delta_{r,gal}=9.5 \pm 2.0$ for the blue and red peaks, respectively, and
$\delta_{t,gal}=7.6\pm 1.4$ for the entire region. These overdensities

to identify comparably massive $z\sim 3$ protoclusters, and uncover the
underlying structure and ultimate fate of the SSA22 protocluster. For this
analysis, we construct mock redshift histograms for each simulated $z\sim 3$

find that the observed double-peaked structure in the SSA22 redshift histogram
corresponds not to a single coalescing cluster, but rather the proximity of a
$\sim 10^{15}h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ protocluster and at least one $>10^{14} h^{-1}

easily understood within the framework of hierarchical clustering of dark

velocity-metallicity correlation and its evolution with redshift and find the
correlation derived from emission lines to have a significantly smaller scatter
compared to that found using absorption lines. Using 33 GRB hosts with measured
stellar mass and metallicitiy, we study the mass-metallicity relation for GRB
host galaxies in a stellar mass range of $10^{8.2} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.1}
M_{\odot}$ and a redshift range of $ z\sim 0.3-3.4$. The GRB-selected galaxies
appear to track the mass-metallicity relation of star forming galaxies but with
an offset of 0.15 towards lower metallicities. This offset is comparable with
the average error-bar on the metallicity measurements of the GRB sample and
also the scatter on the MZ relation of the general population. It is hard to
decide whether this relatively small offset is due to systematic effects or the
intrinsic nature of GRB hosts. We also investigate the possibility of using
absorption-line metallicity measurements of GRB hosts to study the
mass-metallicity relation at high redshifts. Our analysis shows that the
metallicity measurements from absorption methods can significantly differ from
emission metallicities and assuming identical measurements from the two methods

merger rate of PBH binaries. We compute the probability distribution of orbital
parameters for PBH binaries formed in the early Universe, accounting for tidal
torquing by all other PBHs, as well as standard large-scale adiabatic
perturbations. We then check whether the orbital parameters of PBH binaries
formed in the early Universe can be significantly affected between formation
and merger. Our analytic estimates indicate that the tidal field of halos and
interactions with other PBHs, as well as dynamical friction by unbound standard
DM particles, do not do significant work on nor torque PBH binaries. We
estimate the torque due to baryon accretion to be much weaker than previous
calculations, albeit possibly large enough to significantly affect the
eccentricity of typical PBH binaries. We also revisit the PBH-binary merger
rate resulting from gravitational capture in present-day halos, accounting for
Poisson fluctuations. If binaries formed in the early Universe survive to the
present time, as suggested by our analytic estimates, they dominate the total
PBH merger rate. Moreover, this merger rate would be orders of magnitude larger
than LIGO's current upper limits if PBHs make a significant fraction of the
dark matter. As a consequence, LIGO would constrain ~10-300 Msun PBHs to
constitute no more than ~1% of the dark matter. To make this conclusion fully
robust, though, numerical study of several complex astrophysical processes -
such as the formation of the first PBH halos and how they may affect PBH
binaries, as well as the accretion of gas onto an extremely eccentric binary -

absorption-line spectroscopy has typically been a challenge because of the
presence of dust. Nevertheless, because DLAs trace distant gas-rich galaxies
regardless of their luminosity, they provide an attractive way of measuring the
evolution of the metallicity of the neutral gas with cosmic time. This has been
done extensively so far, but typically not taking proper dust corrections into
account. The aims of this paper are to: i) provide a simplified way of
calculating dust corrections, based on a single observed [$X$/Fe], ii) assess
the importance of dust corrections for DLA metallicities and their evolution,
and iii) investigate the cosmic evolution of iron for a large DLA sample. We
have derived dust corrections based on the observed [Zn/Fe], [Si/Fe], or
[S/Fe], and confirmed their robustness. We present dust-corrected metallicities
in a scale of [Fe/H]$_{\rm tot}$ for 236 DLAs over a broad range of $z$, and
assess the extent of dust corrections for different metals at different
metallicities. Dust corrections in DLAs are important even for Zn (typically of
0.1-0.2, and up to $0.5$~dex), which is often neglected. Finally, we study the
evolution of the dust-corrected metallicity with $z$. The DLA metallicities
decrease with redshift, by a factor of 50-100 from today to $\sim12.6$ billion
years ago ($z=5$). When including dust corrections, the average DLA
metallicities are 0.4--0.5~dex higher than without corrections. The upper
envelope of the relation between metallicity and $z$ reaches solar metallicity
at $z\lesssim0.5$, although some systems can have solar metallicity already out
to $z\sim3$.

freedom of supersymmetric black holes. To be consistent with duality, the black
hole quantum degeneracy must obey special arithmetic properties, which are
non-perturbative in nature. In this work, we study these properties from a
holographic point of view, establishing a connection between arithmetic
properties of Kloosterman sums and quantum gravity in $\text{AdS}_2$ space. To
this end, we consider the entropy of black holes that carry non-primitive
charges, in both $\mathcal{N}=8$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ four dimensional
compactifications; our analysis includes all the perturbative and
non-perturbative bulk quantum corrections. The key result relies on special
arithmetic properties of generalized Kloosterman sums that we develop. These
are a generalization of the known Selberg identity of classical Kloosterman
sums. In both the $\mathcal{N}=8$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ examples, we recover,
from the bulk quantum gravity, the non-primitive answer which is a sum over the
primitive degeneracies, depending non-trivially on the discrete duality
invariants. In particular, for the $\mathcal{N}=4$ case we show that the
quantum gravity answer reproduces the dependence on the torsion invariant
$I=\text{gcd}(Q\wedge P)$, in agreement with the microscopic formulas. For the
$\mathcal{N}=8$ case, we solve a puzzle related to U-duality invariance of the
supergravity answer and the corresponding one-eighth BPS degeneracy.

semimetals into a non-Fermi liquid phase of matter. In a previous work, Phys.
Rev. B 95, 205106 (2017), the effect of disorder on this non-Fermi liquid phase
was investigated, assuming that the bandstructure was isotropic, assuming that
the conduction and valence bands had the same band mass, and assuming that the
disorder preserved exact time-reversal symmetry and statistical isotropy. It
was shown that the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is unstable to disorder, and
that a runaway flow to strong disorder occurs. In this work, we extend that
analysis by relaxing the assumption of time-reversal symmetry and allowing the
electron and hole masses to differ (but continuing to assume isotropy of the
low energy bandstructure). We first incorporate time-reversal symmetry breaking
disorder, and demonstrate that there do not appear any new fixed points.
Moreover, while the system continues to flow to strong disorder,
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder grows asymptotically more slowly than
time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder, which we therefore expect should
dominate the strong-coupling phase. We then allow for unequal electron and hole
masses. We show that whereas asymmetry in the two masses is irrelevant in the
clean system, it is relevant in the presence of disorder, such that the
'effective masses' of the conduction and valence bands should become sharply
distinct in the low-energy limit. We calculate the RG flow equations for the
disordered interacting system with unequal band masses, and demonstrate that
the problem exhibits a runaway flow to strong disorder. Along the runaway flow,
time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder grows asymptotically more rapidly
than both time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder and the Coulomb interaction.

axion clouds around rotating black holes. We show that, despite the long
lifetime of the QCD axion with respect to spontaneous decay into photon pairs,
stimulated decay becomes significant above a minimum axion density and leads to
extremely bright lasers. The lasing threshold can be attained for axion masses
$\mu \gtrsim 10^{-8}\ \mathrm{eV}$, which implies superradiant instabilities
around spinning primordial black holes with mass $\lesssim 0.01M_\odot$.
Although the latter are expected to be non-rotating at formation, a population
of spinning black holes may result from subsequent mergers. We further show
that lasing can be quenched by Schwinger pair production, which produces a
critical electron-positron plasma within the axion cloud. Lasing can
nevertheless restart once annihilation lowers the plasma density sufficiently,
resulting in multiple laser bursts that repeat until the black hole spins down
sufficiently to quench the superradiant instability. In particular, axions with
a mass $\sim 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{eV}$ and primordial black holes with mass $\sim

For spectroscopic binaries, using our approach, it is possible to derive a

a dimensionality reduction of the feature space from seven to three search

explore a smaller number of parameters in each case, improving the

early ($\sim$ 19.2 days after discovery); the dust shell is not seen to be
optically thick. Estimates are made of the dust temperature, dust mass and
grain size. Dust formation commences around day 19.2 at a condensation
temperature of 1461 $\pm$ 15 K, suggestive of a carbon composition, following
which the temperature is seen to gradually decrease to 950K. The dust mass
shows a rapid initial increase which we interpret as being due to an increase
in the number of grains, followed by a period of constancy suggesting the
absence of grain destruction processes during this latter time. A discussion is
made of the evolution of these parameters, including certain peculiarities seen
in the grain radius evolution.

exhibit sharper and earlier ones. The fraction of accreted stars increases with
galactocentric distance, so that at a radius of ~8-10 kpc a fraction of ~40 per
cent, on average, are detected. Accreted stars are slightly younger, lower
metallicity, and more $\alpha$-enhanced than in situ stars. A significant
fraction of old stars in the central regions come from a few ($2-3$) massive
satellites ($\sim 10^{10}{\rm M}_\odot$). The bulge components receive larger

inference of a Gaussian linear model with additive noise in presence of
overabundant data. Three different optimal projections of the observations are
proposed based on information theory: the projection that minimizes the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior distributions of the original
and the projected models, the one that minimizes the expected Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the same distributions, and the one that maximizes the
mutual information between the parameter of interest and the projected
observations. The first two optimization problems are formulated as the
determination of an optimal subspace and therefore the solution is computed
using Riemannian optimization algorithms on the Grassmann manifold. Regarding
the maximization of the mutual information, it is shown that there exists an
optimal subspace that minimizes the entropy of the posterior distribution of
the reduced model; a basis of the subspace can be computed as the solution to a
generalized eigenvalue problem; an a priori error estimate on the mutual
information is available for this particular solution; and that the
dimensionality of the subspace to exactly conserve the mutual information
between the input and the output of the models is less than the number of
parameters to be inferred. Numerical applications to linear and nonlinear
models are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed approaches, and to

  in regression",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The choice of tuning parameters in Bayesian variable selection is a critical
problem in modern statistics. In particular, for Bayesian linear regression
with non-local priors, the scale parameter in the non-local prior density is an
important tuning parameter which reflects the dispersion of the non-local prior
density around zero, and implicitly determines the size of the regression
coefficients that will be shrunk to zero. Current approaches treat the scale
parameter as given, and suggest choices based on prior coverage/asymptotic
considerations. In this paper, we consider the fully Bayesian approach
introduced in (Wu, 2016) with the pMOM non-local prior and an appropriate
Inverse-Gamma prior on the tuning parameter to analyze the underlying
theoretical property. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish
strong model selection consistency in a high-dimensional setting, where $p$ is
allowed to increase at a polynomial rate with n$or even at a sub-exponential
rate with n. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our model
selection procedure can outperform other Bayesian methods which treat the scale
parameter as given, and commonly used penalized likelihood methods, in a range
of simulation settings.

can achieve collective intelligence based on local interactions and simple

robotic swarms to achieve a global objective can be challenging. Although it is
often possible to design an optimal centralized strategy for smaller numbers of
agents, those methods can fail as the number of agents increases. Motivated by
the growing success of machine learning, we develop a deep learning approach
that learns distributed coordination policies from centralized policies. In
contrast to traditional distributed control approaches, which are usually based
on human-designed policies for relatively simple tasks, this learning-based
approach can be adapted to more difficult tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our proposed approach on two different tasks, the well-known rendezvous problem
and a more difficult particle assignment problem. For the latter, no known
distributed policy exists. From extensive simulations, it is shown that the
performance of the learned coordination policies is comparable to the
centralized policies, surpassing state-of-the-art distributed policies.
Thereby, our proposed approach provides a promising alternative for real-world
coordination problems that would be otherwise computationally expensive to

stratified flows. Using scaling arguments we show that when the background
shear is weak, the Boussinesq approximation yields either (i) $A_t\ll
\mathcal{O}(1)$ or (ii) $Fr_c^2 \ll \mathcal{O}(1)$, where $A_t$ is the ratio
of density variation to the mean density and $Fr_c$ is the ratio of the phase
speed to the long wave speed. The second clause implies, contrary to the
commonly accepted notion, that a flow with large density variations can also be
Boussinesq. Indeed, we show that deepwater surface gravity waves are Boussinesq
while shallow water surface gravity waves are not. However, in the presence of
moderate/strong shear, Boussinesq approximation implies the conventionally
accepted $A_t\ll \mathcal{O}(1)$. To understand the inertial effects of density
variation, our second objective is to explore various non-Boussinesq shear
flows and study different kinds of stably propagating waves that can be present
at an interface between two fluids of different background densities and
vorticities. Furthermore, three kinds of density interfaces - neutral, stable
and unstable - embedded in a background shear layer, are investigated.
Instabilities ensuing from these configurations, which includes
Kelvin-Helmholtz, Holmboe, Rayleigh-Taylor and triangular-jet, are studied in
terms of resonant wave interactions. The effects of density stratification and
the shear on the stability of each of these flow configurations are explored.
Some of the results, e.g. the destabilizing role of density stratification,
stabilizing role of shear, etc. are apparently counter-intuitive, but physical
explanations are possible if the instabilities are interpreted from wave

constraints on finite-range forces from a universally coupled massive scalar
field. Such scalar degrees of freedom are a characteristic feature of many
extensions of General Relativity. For concreteness, we work in the context of
metric $f(R)$ gravity, which is equivalent to General Relativity and a
universally coupled scalar field with a non-linear potential whose form is
fixed by the choice of $f(R)$. In theories where neutron stars (or other
compact objects) obtain a significant scalar charge, the resulting attractive
finite-range scalar force has implications for both the inspiral and merger
phases of binary systems. We first present an analysis of the inspiral dynamics
in Newtonian limit, and forecast the constraints on the mass of the scalar and
charge of the compact objects for the Advanced LIGO gravitational wave
observatory. We then perform a comparative study of binary neutron star mergers
in General Relativity with those of a one-parameter model of $f(R)$ gravity
using fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations
elucidate the effects of the scalar on the merger and post-merger dynamics. We
comment on the utility of the full waveform (inspiral, merger, post-merger) to
probe different regions of parameter space for both the particular model of
$f(R)$ gravity studied here and for finite-range scalar forces more generally.

assimilation (DA) methods, originally designed for state estimation, to the
model selection problem. In this setting, Carrassi et al. (2017) introduced the
contextual formulation of model evidence (CME) and showed that CME can be
efficiently computed using a hierarchy of ensemble-based DA procedures.
Although Carrassi et al. (2017) analyzed the DA methods most commonly used for
operational atmospheric and oceanic prediction worldwide, they did not study
these methods in conjunction with localization to a specific domain. Yet any
application of ensemble DA methods to realistic geophysical models requires the
implementation of some form of localization. The present study extends the
theory for estimating CME to ensemble DA methods with domain localization. The
domain-localized CME (DL-CME) developed herein is tested for model selection
with two models: (i) the Lorenz 40-variable mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics
model (L95); and (ii) the simplified global atmospheric SPEEDY model. The CME
is compared to the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) as a metric for model
selection. The experiments show that CME improves systematically over the RMSE,
and that this skill improvement is further enhanced by applying localization in
the estimate of the CME, using the DL-CME. The potential use and range of
applications of the CME and DL-CME as a model selection metric are also
discussed.

were initially studied for many promising reasons: resolving the measurement
problem, testing the limits of standard quantum mechanics, and reconciling it
with gravity. Two results substantially undermined the credibility of
non-linear theories. Some have been experimentally refuted, and more
importantly, all deterministic non-linear theories can be used for superluminal
communication. However, these results are unconvincing because they overlook
the fact that the distribution of measurement results predicted by non-linear
quantum mechanics depends on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that one
uses. For instance, although the Everett and Copenhagen interpretations agree
on the expression of Born's rule for the outcomes of multiple measurements in
linear quantum mechanics, they disagree in non-linear quantum mechanics. We
present the range of expressions of Born's rule that can be obtained by
applying different formulations of quantum mechanics to a class of non-linear
quantum theories. We then determine that many do not allow for superluminal
communication but only two seem to have a reasonable justification. The first
is the Everett interpretation, and the second, which we name
causal-conditional, states that a measurement broadcasts its outcome to degrees
of freedom in its future light-cone, who update the wavefunction that their
non-linear Hamiltonian depends on according to this new information.

decomposition---that delineates how statistical dependencies influence the

to define a measure of the information about a target that can be uniquely
attributed to a particular source as the least amount which the source-target
statistical dependency can influence the information shared between the sources

of the PID framework while not satisfying the Blackwell relation, which depends
on a particular interpretation of how the variables are related. This makes a
key step forward to a practical PID.

on the cell surface and the specific intracellular signaling pathways activated

of order 1e-10 at visible wavelengths can be obtained by blocking stellar

coronagraph) to the telescope system, and managing diffracted starlight, so as
to directly image the exoplanet in reected starlight. Coronagraph instruments
require advancement in telescope aperture (either monolithic or segmented),
aperture obscurations (obscured by secondary mirror and its support struts),
and wavefront error sensitivity (e.g. line-of-sight jitter, telescope
vibration, polarization). The starshade, which has never been used in a science
application, benefits a mission by being decoupled from the telescope, allowing
a loosening of telescope stability requirements. In doing so, it transfers the
difficult technology from the telescope system to a large deployable structure
(tens of meters to greater than 100 m in diameter) that must be positioned
precisely at a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers from the telescope.

the end effector and let it randomly move through a set of open-loop
trajectories to obtain a large sample set of camera pixels and internal robot
end-effector configurations. This coarse data is then used to train a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) to learn the coarse transformation bias. In Phase II
(fine), the bias from Phase I is applied to move the end-effector toward a
small set of specific target points on a printed sheet. For each target, a
human operator manually adjusts the end-effector position by direct contact
(not through teleoperation) and the residual compensation bias is recorded.
This fine data is then used to train a Random Forest (RF) to learn the fine
transformation bias. Subsequent experiments suggest that without calibration,
position errors average 4.55mm. Phase I can reduce average error to 2.14mm and
the combination of Phase I and Phase II can reduces average error to 1.08mm. We

  Point Clouds using a New Analytic Model and Deep Learning","Accepted to ICRA 2018",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vacuum-based end effectors are widely used in industry and are often
preferred over parallel-jaw and multifinger grippers due to their ability to
lift objects with a single point of contact. Suction grasp planners often
target planar surfaces on point clouds near the estimated centroid of an
object. In this paper, we propose a compliant suction contact model that
computes the quality of the seal between the suction cup and local target
surface and a measure of the ability of the suction grasp to resist an external
gravity wrench. To characterize grasps, we estimate robustness to perturbations
in end-effector and object pose, material properties, and external wrenches. We
analyze grasps across 1,500 3D object models to generate Dex-Net 3.0, a dataset
of 2.8 million point clouds, suction grasps, and grasp robustness labels. We
use Dex-Net 3.0 to train a Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Network (GQ-CNN)
to classify robust suction targets in point clouds containing a single object.
We evaluate the resulting system in 350 physical trials on an ABB YuMi fitted
with a pneumatic suction gripper. When evaluated on novel objects that we
categorize as Basic (prismatic or cylindrical), Typical (more complex
geometry), and Adversarial (with few available suction-grasp points) Dex-Net
3.0 achieves success rates of 98$\%$, 82$\%$, and 58$\%$ respectively,
improving to 81$\%$ in the latter case when the training set includes only
adversarial objects. Code, datasets, and supplemental material can be found at

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performances vary
significantly across different tasks, implying that the word embeddings learnt
by those methods capture complementary aspects of lexical semantics. Therefore,
we believe that it is important to combine the existing word embeddings to
produce more accurate and complete \emph{meta-embeddings} of words. For this
purpose, we propose an unsupervised locally linear meta-embedding learning
method that takes pre-trained word embeddings as the input, and produces more
accurate meta embeddings. Unlike previously proposed meta-embedding learning
methods that learn a global projection over all words in a vocabulary, our
proposed method is sensitive to the differences in local neighbourhoods of the
individual source word embeddings. Moreover, we show that vector concatenation,
a previously proposed highly competitive baseline approach for integrating word
embeddings, can be derived as a special case of the proposed method.
Experimental results on semantic similarity, word analogy, relation
classification, and short-text classification tasks show that our
meta-embeddings to significantly outperform prior methods in several benchmark
datasets, establishing a new state of the art for meta-embeddings.

retrieval. A simple, yet surprisingly accurate method for representing a
relation between two words is to compute the vector offset (\PairDiff) between
their corresponding word embeddings. Despite the empirical success, it remains
unclear as to whether \PairDiff is the best operator for obtaining a relational
representation from word embeddings. We conduct a theoretical analysis of
generalised bilinear operators that can be used to measure the $\ell_{2}$
relational distance between two word-pairs. We show that, if the word
embeddings are standardised and uncorrelated, such an operator will be
independent of bilinear terms, and can be simplified to a linear form, where
\PairDiff is a special case. For numerous word embedding types, we empirically
verify the uncorrelation assumption, demonstrating the general applicability of
our theoretical result. Moreover, we experimentally discover \PairDiff from the
bilinear relation composition operator on several benchmark analogy datasets.

the activation barrier is $26.8(6)$ meV with prefactor $1.23(5) \times 10^{10}$

key step towards demonstrating such a system will be performing a computation
beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, achieving so-called quantum
supremacy. Here, using 9 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate an immediate
path towards quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we
are able to generate thousands of unique Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the
output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution,
consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert-space. As the number of
qubits in the algorithm is varied, the system continues to explore the
exponentially growing number of states. Combining these large datasets with
techniques from machine learning allows us to construct a model which
accurately predicts the measured probabilities. We demonstrate an application
of these algorithms by systematically increasing the disorder and observing a
transition from delocalized states to localized states. By extending these
results to a system of 50 qubits, we hope to address scientific questions that
are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.

deeper than 2MASS. We use these images to unveil asymmetries in the outskirts

which allows to quantify the degree of disruption by the relative area occupied
by the tidal features on the plane of the sky. We measure the asymmetries for a
subsample of 41 large area objects finding clear asymmetries in ten galaxies,
most of them being in groups and pairs projected at different clustercentric
distances, some of them located beyond R500 . Combining information on the
Hi-gas content of blue galaxies and the distribution of sub-structures across
Abell 85, with the present NIR asymmetry analysis, we obtain a very powerful
tool to confirm that tidal mechanisms are indeed present and are currently
affecting a fraction of galaxies in Abell 85. However, when comparing our deep
NIR images with UV-blue images of two very disrupted (jellyfish) galaxies in
this cluster, we discard the presence of tidal 1 interactions down to our
detection limit. Our results suggest that ram-pressure stripping is at the
origin of such spectacular disruptions. We conclude that across a complex

hydrodynamical, are playing an active role in driving galaxy evolution.

understand the current (and prior) state of the distributed systems deployed in

at scale, they also pose a significant challenge for the application
developers/operators to transform the huge space of monitored metrics into
useful insights. These insights are essential to build effective management
tools for improving the efficiency, resiliency, and dependability of
distributed systems.
  This paper reports on our experience with building and deploying Sieve - a
platform to derive actionable insights from monitored metrics in distributed
systems. Sieve builds on two core components: a metrics reduction framework,
and a metrics dependency extractor. More specifically, Sieve first reduces the
dimensionality of metrics by automatically filtering out unimportant metrics by
observing their signal over time. Afterwards, Sieve infers metrics dependencies
between distributed components of the system using a predictive-causality model
by testing for Granger Causality. We implemented Sieve as a generic platform
and deployed it for two microservices-based distributed systems: OpenStack and
ShareLatex. Our experience shows that (1) Sieve can reduce the number of
metrics by at least an order of magnitude (10 - 100$\times$), while preserving
the statistical equivalence to the total number of monitored metrics; (2) Sieve
can dramatically improve existing monitoring infrastructures by reducing the
associated overheads over the entire system stack (CPU - 80%, storage - 90%,
and network - 50%); (3) Lastly, Sieve can be effective to support a wide-range
of workflows in distributed systems - we showcase two such workflows:
orchestration of autoscaling, and Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

testing in zero-field Ising models. Instead of learning the entire graph
structure, sometimes testing a basic graph property such as connectivity, cycle
presence or maximum clique size is a more relevant and attainable objective.
Since property testing is more fundamental than graph recovery, any necessary
conditions for property testing imply corresponding conditions for graph
recovery, while custom property tests can be statistically and/or
computationally more efficient than graph recovery based algorithms.
Understanding the statistical complexity of property testing requires the
distinction of ferromagnetic (i.e., positive interactions only) and general
Ising models. Using combinatorial constructs such as graph packing and strong
monotonicity, we characterize how target properties affect the corresponding
minimax upper and lower bounds within the realm of ferromagnets. On the other
hand, by studying the detection of an antiferromagnetic (i.e., negative
interactions only) Curie-Weiss model buried in Rademacher noise, we show that
property testing is strictly more challenging over general Ising models. In
terms of methodological development, we propose two types of correlation based
tests: computationally efficient screening for ferromagnets, and score type
tests for general models, including a fast cycle presence test. Our correlation
screening tests match the information-theoretic bounds for property testing in
ferromagnets.

significant individual variation in awake and sleep times. Individuals with
circadian rhythms at the extremes can be categorized into two chronotypes:
""larks"", those who wake up and go to sleep early, and ""owls"", those who stay up

their activities and health. However, less is known on the effects of
chronotypes on the social behavior, even though it is evident that social
interactions require coordinated timings. To study how chronotypes relate to
social behavior, we use data collected using a smartphone app on a population
of more than seven hundred volunteer students to simultaneously determine their
chronotypes and social network structure. We find that owls maintain larger
personal networks, albeit with less time spent per contact. On average, owls
are more central in the social network of students than larks, frequently
occupying the dense core of the network. Owls also display strong homophily, as
seen in an unexpectedly large number of social ties connecting owls to owls.

weighted pre-Sobolev spaces with dominating mixed partial derivatives. We begin
by finding a ball in those spaces just barely large enough to contain a
function with unit variance. If no function in that ball has more than
$\varepsilon$ of its variance from ANOVA components involving interactions of
order $s$ or more, then the space has effective dimension at most $s$ in the
superposition sense. A similar truncation sense notion replaces the cardinality
of the ANOVA component by the largest index it contains. Some Poincar\'e type
inequalities are used to bound variance components by multiples of these
space's squared norm and those in turn provide bounds on effective dimension.
Very low effective dimension in the superposition sense holds for some spaces
defined by product weights in which quadrature is strongly tractable. The
superposition dimension is $O( \log(1/\varepsilon)/\log(\log(1/\varepsilon)))$
just like the superposition dimension used in the multidimensional
decomposition method. Surprisingly, even spaces where all subset weights are
equal, regardless of their cardinality or included indices, have low
superposition dimension in this sense. This paper does not require periodicity
of the integrands.

mmWave MIMO channels while taking into account their underlying sparse
structure, the temporal shifts across antennas in the broadband regime, and
ultimately one-bit quantization at the receiver. The sparsity in the angular
domain is exploited as a key property to enable the unambiguous blind
separation between user's channels. The main advantage of this approach is the
fact that the overhead due to pilot sequences can be dramatically reduced
especially when operating at low SNR per antenna. In addition, as sparsity is
the only assumption made about the channel, the proposed method is robust with
respect to the statistical properties of the channel and data and allows the
channel estimation and the separation of interfering users from adjacent base
stations to be performed in rapidly time-varying scenarios. For the case of
one-bit receivers, a blind channel estimation is proposed that relies on the
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Additionally, performance limits are
derived based on the clairvoyant Cramer Rao lower bound. Simulation results
demonstrate that this maximum likelihood formulation yields superior estimation
accuracy in the narrowband as well as the wideband regime with reasonable
computational complexity and limited model assumptions.

of a rubidium-87 atom, we study the dependencies of the quadrupole Rabi
frequency on the quantum numbers of the transition, the mode type, the phase
circulation direction, the propagation direction, the orientation of the

We show that the enhancement factors of the rms Rabi frequency and the
oscillator strength do not depend on any characteristics of the internal atomic
states except for the atomic transition frequency. The enhancement factor of
the oscillator strength can be significant even when the atom is far away from
the fiber. We show that, in the case where the atom is positioned on the fiber

mode HE$_{11}$ has a local minimum at the fiber radius $a\simeq 107$ nm, and is
larger than that for quasicircularly polarized higher-order hybrid modes, TE

properties can be obtained by comparing such an LHS surface with a
corresponding quantum steering ellipsoid. Thus, we propose a witness of
steerability corresponding to the difference of the volumes enclosed by these
two surfaces. This witness (which reveals the steerability of a quantum state)
enables finding an optimal measurement basis, which can then be used to
determine the proposed steering monotone (which describes the steerability of

signals, cannot be perfectly recovered from their generalized analytic signals.
Therefore, in this paper, the conventional Hilbert transform (HT) and analytic
signal associated with the LCT are concerned. To transform a real signal into
the LCT of its HT, two integral transforms (i.e., the HT and LCT) are required.
The goal of this paper is to simplify cascades of multiple integral transforms,
which may be the HT, analytic signal, LCT or inverse LCT. The proposed
transforms can reduce the complexity when realizing the relationships among the
following six kinds of signals: a real signal, its HT and analytic signal, and
the LCT of these three signals. Most importantly, all the proposed transforms
are reversible and undistorted. Using the proposed transforms, several signal
processing applications are discussed and show the advantages and flexibility
over simply using the analytic signal or the LCT.

administrative divisions, merged cities into large built extensions, and
blurred the boundaries between urban and rural land-uses. These traits, present
in most of contemporary metropolis, complicate the definition of cities, a
crucial issue considering that objective and comparable metrics are the basic
inputs needed for the planning and design of sustainable urban environments. In
this context, city definitions that respond to administrative or political
criteria usually overlook human dynamics, a key factor that could help to make
cities comparable across the urban fabric of diverse social, cultural and
economic realities. Using a technique based on the spectral analysis of complex
networks, we rank places in 11 of the major Chilean urban regions from a
high-resolution human mobility dataset: Official origin-destination (OD)
surveys. We propose a method for further distinguishing urban and rural
land-uses within these regions, by means of a network centrality measure from
which we construct a spectre of geographic places. This spectre, constructed
from the ranking of locations as measured by their approximate number of
embedded human flows, allows us to probe several urban boundaries. From the
analysis of the urban scaling exponent of trips in relation to the population
across these city delineations, we identify two clearly distinct scaling
regimes occurring in urban and rural areas. The comparison of our results with
land cover derived from remote sensing suggests that, for the case of trips,
the scaling exponent in urban areas is close to linear. We conclude with
estimations for well-formed cities in the Chilean urban system, which according
to our analysis could emerge from clusters composed by places that capture at
least ~138 trips (over the expectation) of the underlying mobility network.

the attractive reduced BCS interaction is fixed to be small but independent of
the temperature and the imaginary magnetic field unless the temperature is

conditions are typically satisfied by free electron models with degenerate
Fermi surface. For example, our theory applies to the model with
nearest-neighbor hopping on 3 or 4-dimensional (hyper-)cubic lattice having
degenerate free Fermi surface or the model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the
honeycomb lattice with zero chemical potential. We prove that a spontaneous
U(1)-symmetry breaking (SSB) and an off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO) occur
in many areas of the parameter space. The SSB and the ODLRO are proved to occur
in low temperatures arbitrarily close to zero in particular. However, it turns
out that the SSB and the ODLRO are not present in the zero-temperature limit.
The proof is based on Grassmann Gaussian integral formulations and a
multi-scale infrared analysis of the formulations. We keep using notations and

we characterize the progression of apoptosis in wild type and SIRT6 deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts using time-lapse flow cytometry and computational
modelling based on rate-equations and cell distribution analysis. We find that
SIRT6 deficient cells resist apoptosis by delaying its initiation.
Interestingly, once apoptosis is initiated, the rate of its progression is
higher in SIRT6 null cells compared to identically cultured wild type cells.
However, SIRT6 null cells succumb to apoptosis more slowly, not only in
response to nutrient deprivation but also in response to other stresses. Our
data suggest that SIRT6 plays a role in several distinct steps of apoptosis.
Overall, we demonstrate the utility of our computational model to describe
stages of apoptosis progression and the integrity of the cellular membrane.
Such measurements will be useful in a broad range of biological applications.
We describe a computational method to evaluate the progression of apoptosis
through different stages. Using this method, we describe how cells devoid of
SIRT6 longevity gene respond to apoptosis stimuli, specifically, how they
respond to starvation. We find that SIRT6 cells resist apoptosis initiation;
however, once initiated, they progress through the apoptosis at a faster rate.
These data are first of the kind and suggest that SIRT6 activities might play
different roles at different stages of apoptosis. The model that we propose can
be used to quantitatively evaluate progression of apoptosis and will be useful
in studies of cancer treatments and other areas where apoptosis is involved.

Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction followed by a dual master action. Here we
show that a similar route takes us from the

communication logs of a cloud-troubleshooting system, road-network traffic
updates, and interactions on a social network. A labeled-graph stream refers to
a sequence of streamed edges that form a labeled graph. Label-aware
applications need to filter the graph stream before performing a graph
operation. Due to the large volume and high velocity of these streams, it is
often more practical to incrementally build a lossy-compressed version of the
graph, and use this lossy version to approximately evaluate graph queries.
Challenges arise when the queries are unknown in advance but are associated
with filtering predicates based on edge labels. Surprisingly common, and
especially challenging, are labeled-graph streams that have highly skewed label
distributions that might also vary over time. This paper introduces
Self-Balanced Graph Sketch (SBG-Sketch, for short), a graphical sketch for
summarizing and querying labeled-graph streams that can cope with all these
challenges. SBG-Sketch maintains synopsis for both the edge attributes (e.g.,
edge weight) as well as the topology of the streamed graph. SBG-Sketch allows
efficient processing of graph-traversal queries, e.g., reachability queries.
Experimental results over a variety of real graph streams show SBG-Sketch to
reduce the estimation errors of state-of-the-art methods by up to 99%.

inhomogeneities treated exactly. The force acting on the heavy particle(s) is
studied as a function of its terminal velocity, both in the linear and
non-linear regime. Linear mobility (which is valid for impurities moving much
slower than a certain cross-over speed) has a power-law temperature dependence
whose exponent has a closed algebraic expression in terms of the various
parameters in the problem. This expression interpolates between the ballistic
regime of no-coupling with the fermions and the no-tunneling regime. When the
speed of the impurity is much larger than this cross-over speed, the applied
force depends non linearly on the speed and this too is a power-law with a
closely related exponent. The case of two mobile impurities is also studied
whose mobility exhibits peculiar resonances when their mutual separation is
appropriately chosen.

metallicity of $\mathrm{12+log(O/H) = 8.07\pm0.07}$ at
$\mathrm{log(M_*/M_\odot) \sim 9.0-9.2}$ and $\mathrm{12+log(O/H) =
8.31\pm0.04}$ at $\mathrm{log(M_*/M_\odot) \sim 9.7-10.2}$ when using the
empirical calibration method. We compare the [OIII] emitters at $z\sim3.2$ with
UV-selected galaxies and Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the same epoch and find that
the [OIII]-based selection does not appear to show any systematic bias in the
selection of star-forming galaxies. Moreover, comparing with star-forming
galaxies at $z\sim2$ from literature, our samples show similar ionization
parameters and gas metallicities as those obtained by the previous studies
using the same calibration method. We find no strong redshift evolution in the
ISM conditions between $z\sim3.2$ and $z\sim2$. Considering that the star
formation rates at a fixed stellar mass also do not significantly change
between the two epochs, our results support the idea that the stellar mass is
the primary quantity to describe the evolutionary stages of individual galaxies

applied to generate video streams over the Internet. However, HEVC compressed
videos may incur severe quality degradation, particularly at low bit-rates.
Thus, it is necessary to enhance the visual quality of HEVC videos at the
decoder side. To this end, this paper proposes a Quality Enhancement
Convolutional Neural Network (QE-CNN) method that does not require any
modification of the encoder to achieve quality enhancement for HEVC. In
particular, our QE-CNN method learns QE-CNN-I and QE-CNN-P models to reduce the
distortion of HEVC I and P frames, respectively. The proposed method differs
from the existing CNN-based quality enhancement approaches, which only handle
intra-coding distortion and are thus not suitable for P frames. Our
experimental results validate that our QE-CNN method is effective in enhancing
quality for both I and P frames of HEVC videos. To apply our QE-CNN method in
time-constrained scenarios, we further propose a Time-constrained Quality
Enhancement Optimization (TQEO) scheme. Our TQEO scheme controls the
computational time of QE-CNN to meet a target, meanwhile maximizing the quality
enhancement. Next, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our TQEO scheme from the aspects of time control accuracy and quality
enhancement under different time constraints. Finally, we design a prototype to
implement our TQEO scheme in a real-time scenario.

feedback about player experience. Player retention and monetization in
particular have become central business statistics in free-to-play game
development. Many metrics have been used for this purpose. However, game
developers often want to perform analytics in a timely manner before all users
have churned from the game. This causes data censoring which makes many metrics
biased. In this work, we introduce how the Mean Cumulative Function (MCF) can
be used to generalize many academic metrics to censored data. The MCF allows us
to estimate the expected value of a metric over time, which for example may be
the number of game sessions, number of purchases, total playtime and lifetime
value. Furthermore, the popular retention rate metric is the derivative of this
estimate applied to the expected number of distinct days played. Statistical
tools based on the MCF allow game developers to determine whether a given
change improves a game, or whether a game is yet good enough for public
release. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated on a real
in-development free-to-play mobile game, the Hipster Sheep.

consisting of more than 350,000 bots tweeting random quotations exclusively
from Star Wars novels. The bots were exposed because they tweeted uniformly
from any location within two rectangle-shaped geographic zones covering Europe

report another unusual behaviour of the Star Wars bots, that the bots were
created in bursts or batches, and they only tweeted in their first few minutes
since creation. Inspired by this observation, we discovered an even larger
Twitter botnet, the Bursty botnet with more than 500,000 bots. Our preliminary
study showed that the Bursty botnet was directly responsible for a large-scale
online spamming attack in 2012. Most bot detection algorithms have been based
on assumptions of `common' features that were supposedly shared by all bots.
Our discovered botnets, however, do not show many of those features; instead,
they were detected by their distinct, unusual tweeting behaviours that were
unknown until now.

in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue allow to calculate the
local matter density distribution more precisely than earlier. We devised a
method to calculate the stationary gravitational potential distribution
perpendicular to the Galactic plane by comparing the vertical probability
density distribution of a sample of observed stars with the theoretical
probability density distribution computed from their vertical coordinates and
velocities. We applied the model to idealised test stars and to the real
observational samples. Tests with two mock datasets proved that the method is
viable and provides reasonable results. Applying the method to TGAS data we
derived that the total matter density in the Solar neighbourhood is $0.09\pm
0.02 \text{M}_\odot\text{pc}^{-3}$ being consistent with the results from
literature. The matter surface density within $|z|\le 0.75 \text{kpc}$ is
$42\pm 4 \text{M}_\odot\text{pc}^{-2}$. This is slightly less than the results
derived by other authors but within errors is consistent with previous
estimates. Our results show no firm evidence for significant amount of dark
matter in the Solar neighbourhood. However, we caution that our calculations at
$|z| \leq 0.75$ kpc rely on an extrapolation from the velocity distribution
function calculated at $|z| \leq 25$ pc. This extrapolation can be very
sensitive to our assumption that the stellar motions are perfectly decoupled in
R and z, and to our assumption of equilibrium. Indeed, we find that $\rho (z)$
within $|z|\le 0.75$ kpc is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane at
distances $|z| = 0.1-0.4$ kpc indicating that the density distribution may be
influenced by density perturbations.

has become a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose, VCExplorer, a
new interactive graph exploration framework that integrates the strengths of
graph visualization and graph summarization. Unlike existing graph
visualization tools where vertices of a graph may be clustered into a smaller
collection of super/virtual vertices, VCExplorer displays a small number of
actual source graph vertices (called hubs) and summaries of the information
between these vertices. We refer to such a graph as a HA-graph (Hub-based
Aggregation Graph). This allows users to appreciate the relationship between
the hubs, rather than super/virtual vertices. Users can navigate through the
HA- graph by ""drilling down"" into the summaries between hubs to display more
hubs. We illustrate how the graph aggregation techniques can be integrated into
the exploring framework as the consolidated information to users. In addition,
we propose efficient graph aggregation algorithms over multiple subgraphs via
computation sharing. Extensive experimental evaluations have been conducted
using both real and synthetic datasets and the results indicate the
effectiveness and efficiency of VCExplorer for exploration.

is somewhat hampered by the uncertain effective emissivity at these
wavelengths. Following Brown and Butler (2017) who presented ALMA data for four
binary TNOs, we report ALMA 1.29 mm measurements of four Centaurs (2002
GZ$_{32}$, Bienor, Chiron, Chariklo) and two TNOs (Huya and Makemake), sampling
a range of size, albedo and composition. These thermal fluxes are combined with
mid/far-infrared fluxes to derive the relative emissivity at radio (mm/submm)
wavelengths, using NEATM and thermophysical models. We reassess earlier thermal
measurements of these and other objects -- including Pluto/Charon and Varuna --
exploring effects due to non-spherical shape and varying apparent pole
orientation, and show that those can be key for reconciling previous diameter
determinations and correctly estimating the spectral emissivities. We also
evaluate the possible contribution to thermal fluxes of established (Chariklo)
or claimed (Chiron) ring systems. As a general conclusion, all the objects,
except Makemake, have radio emissivities significantly lower than unity.
Although the emissivity values show diversity, we do not find any significant
trend with physical parameters such as diameter, composition, beaming factor,
albedo, or color, but we suggest that the emissivity could be correlated with
grain size. The mean relative radio emissivity is found to be 0.70$\pm$0.13, a

that are several orders of magnitude larger. This requires extreme noise
control and improved wide-field high dynamic-range imaging techniques. We
propose a new imaging method based on a maximum likelihood framework which
solves for the interferometric equation directly on the sphere, or equivalently
in the $uvw$-domain. The method uses the one-to-one relation between spherical
waves and spherical harmonics (SpH). It consistently handles signals from the
entire sky, and does not require a $w$-term correction. The spherical-harmonics
coefficients represent the sky-brightness distribution and the visibilities in
the $uvw$-domain, and provide a direct estimate of the spatial power spectrum.
Using these spectrally-smooth SpH coefficients, bright foregrounds can be
removed from the signal, including their side-lobe noise, which is one of the
limiting factors in high dynamics range wide-field imaging. Chromatic effects
causing the so-called ""wedge"" are effectively eliminated (i.e. deconvolved) in
the cylindrical ($k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel}$) power spectrum, compared to a
power spectrum computed directly from the images of the foreground visibilities
where the wedge is clearly present. We illustrate our method using simulated
LOFAR observations, finding an excellent reconstruction of the input EoR signal

included 537 clinical trials that had registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov. We
tested a matrix factorisation approach that uses a shared latent space to learn
how to rank relevant trial registrations for each systematic review, comparing
the performance to document similarity to rank relevant trial registrations.
The two approaches were tested on a holdout set of the newest trials from the
set of type 2 diabetes systematic reviews and an unseen set of 141 clinical
trial registrations from 17 updated systematic reviews published in the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The matrix factorisation approach
outperformed the document similarity approach with a median rank of 59 and
recall@100 of 60.9%, compared to a median rank of 138 and recall@100 of 42.8%

gave a median rank of 67 (recall@100 of 62.9%). The proposed method was useful
for ranking trial registrations to reduce the manual workload associated with

the approach could be used as part of a semi-automated pipeline for monitoring

non--stationary solution of the dynamic equation ""future price tends to the
value that maximizes the number of shares traded per unit time"" [1] is
presented. We demonstrate that the concept of price impact is poorly applicable
to market dynamics. Instead, we consider the execution flow $I=dV/dt$ operator
with the ""impact from the future"" term providing information about
not--yet--executed trades. The ""impact from the future"" on $I$ can be directly
estimated from the already--executed trades, the directional information on
price is then obtained from the experimentally observed fact that the $I$ and
$p$ operators have the same eigenfunctions (the exact result in the dynamic
impact approximation $p=p(I)$). The condition for ""no information about the

makes a substantial contribution toward solving the ultimate market dynamics

automated trading machine which consistently makes positive P\&L on a free
market as an autonomous agent (aka the existence of the market dynamics

converting the input energy into translational motion. In this work we address
the question if simple self-propelled spheres can assemble into more complex
structures that exhibit rotational motion, possibly coupled with translational
motion as in flagella. We exploit a combination of induced dipolar interactions
and a bonding step to create permanent linear bead chains, composed of
self-propelled Janus spheres, with a well-controlled internal structure. Next,
we study how flexibility between individual swimmers in a chain can affect its
swimming behaviour. Permanent rigid chains showed only active rotational or
spinning motion, whereas longer semi-flexible chains showed both translational
and rotational motion resembling flagella like-motion, in the presence of the
fuel. Moreover, we are able to reproduce our experimental results using
numerical calculations with a minimal model, which includes full hydrodynamic
interactions with the fluid. Our method is general and opens a new way to
design novel self-propelled colloids with complex swimming behaviours, using
different complex starting building blocks in combination with the flexibility
between them.

Also, synthesizing images in a simulation environment for collecting

images may not achieve the desired performance in real environments due to the
gap between synthetic and real images. We thus propose a method that transfers
learned capability of detecting object position from a simulation environment

real images while leveraging a large dataset of synthetic images using multiple
variational autoencoders. It detects object positions 6 to 7 times more
precisely than the baseline of directly learning from the dataset of the real
images. Object position estimation under varying environmental conditions forms
one of the underlying requirement for standard robotic manipulation tasks. We
show that the proposed method performs robustly in different lighting

this detected object position, we transfer pick-and-place or reaching tasks
learned in a simulation environment to an actual physical robot without

including fluid membranes, entanglement entropy and the coupling of defects to
quantum field theories. Based on the formulation of submanifold calculus
developed by Carter, we introduce a new variational principle for (entangling)
surfaces. This principle captures all diffeomorphism constraints on
surface/interface actions and their associated spacetime stress tensor. The
different couplings to the geometric tensors appearing in the surface action
are interpreted in terms of response coefficients within elasticity theory. An
example of a surface action with edges at the two-derivative level is studied,
including both the parity-even and parity-odd sectors. Its conformally
invariant counterpart restricts the type of conformal anomalies that can appear
in two-dimensional submanifolds with boundaries. Analogously to hydrodynamics,
it is shown that classification methods can be used to constrain the stress
tensor of (entangling) surfaces at a given order in derivatives. This analysis
reveals a purely geometric parity-odd contribution to the Young modulus of a
thin elastic membrane. Extending this novel variational principle to BCFTs and
DCFTs in curved spacetimes allows to obtain the Ward identities for
diffeomorphism and Weyl transformations. In this context, we provide a formal
derivation of the contact terms in the stress tensor and of the displacement
operator for a broad class of actions.

observations with GRIS and the information provided by the adaptive optics
system of the GREGOR telescope. The data were then deconvolved from the PSF
using a principal component analysis deconvolution method and were analyzed via
the NICOLE inversion code. The Si i 1082.7 nm line seems to be in emission in
the umbra of the observed sunspot after the effects of scattered light are
removed. We show how the spectral line shape of umbral profiles changes
dramatically with the amount of scattered light. Indeed, the continuum levels
range, on average, from 44% of the quiet Sun continuum intensity to about 20%.
The inferred levels are in line with current model predictions and empirical
umbral models. Current umbral empirical models are not able to reproduce the
emission in the deconvolved umbral Stokes profiles. The results of the NLTE
inversions suggests that to obtain the emission in the Si i 1082.7 nm line, the
temperature stratification should first have a hump located at about log tau -2
and start rising at lower heights when moving into the transition region. This
is, to our knowledge, the first time the Si i 1082.7 nm line is seen in
emission in sunspot umbrae. The results show that the temperature
stratification of current umbral models may be more complex than expected with
the transition region located at lower heights above sunspot umbrae. Our
finding might provide insights into understanding why the sunspot umbra
emission in the millimeter spectral range is less than that predicted by
current empirical umbral models.

free energy reconstruction methods in molecular dynamics simulations. The
PLUMED 2 library, for instance, provides several sophisticated CV choices,
implemented in a C++ framework; however, developing new CVs is still time
consuming due to the need to provide code for the analytical derivatives of all
functions with respect to atomic coordinates. We present two solutions to this
problem, namely (a) symbolic differentiation and code generation, and (b)
automatic code differentiation, in both cases leveraging open-source libraries
(SymPy and Stan Math respectively). The two approaches are demonstrated and
discussed in detail implementing a realistic example CV, the local radius of
curvature of a polymer. Users may use the code as a template to streamline the
implementation of their own CVs using high-level constructs and automatic
gradient computation.

point of view, an important aim of the analysis is to assess significant
associations between the covariates and the point pattern intensity of a given
species. This paper introduces the use of a reparameterised model to facilitate
meaningful interpretations of the results and how these depend on hyperprior
specifications. The model combines a scaled spatially structured field with an
unstructured random field, having a common precision parameter. An additional
hyperparameter identifies the fraction of variance explained by the spatially
structured term and proper scaling makes the analysis invariant to grid
resolution. The hyperparameters are assigned penalised complexity priors, which
can be tuned intuitively by user-defined scaling parameters. We illustrate the
approach analysing covariate effects on point patterns formed by two rainforest
tree species in a study plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.

bulges) is a consequence of successive mergers and/or growth of near-wall
hairpin vortices. In the present study, we report our direct observation that
large-scale motion is generated by an instability of an `amplified' streaky
motion in the outer region (i.e. very-large-scale motion). We design a
numerical experiment in turbulent channel flow up to $Re_\tau\simeq 2000$ where
a streamwise-uniform streaky motion is artificially driven by body forcing in
the outer region computed from the previous linear theory (Hwang \& Cossu, J.
Fluid Mech., vol. 664, 2015, pp. 51--73). As the forcing amplitude is
increased, it is found that an energetic streamwise vortical structure emerges
at a streamwise wavelength of $\lambda_x/h\simeq 1-5$ ($h$ is the half-height
of the channel). The application of dynamic mode decomposition and the
examination of turbulence statistics reveal that this structure is a
consequence of the sinuous-mode instability of the streak, a sub-process of the
self-sustaining mechanism of the large-scale outer structures. It is also found
that the statistical features of the vortical structure are remarkably similar
to those of the large-scale motion in the outer region. Finally, it is proposed
that the largest streamwise length of the streak instability determines the
streamwise length scale of very-large-scale motion.

time-variant stochastic channels of diffusive mobile MC systems. In particular,
we consider a diffusive mobile MC system consisting of a pair of transmitter
and receiver nano-machines suspended in a fluid medium with a uniform bulk
flow, where we assume that either the transmitter, or the receiver, or both are
mobile and we model the mobility by Brownian motion. The transmitter and
receiver nano-machines exchange information via diffusive signaling molecules.
Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the
statistics of the channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. We derive
closed-form expressions for the mean, the autocorrelation function (ACF), the
cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the probability density function
(PDF) of the time-variant CIR. Exploiting the ACF, we define the coherence time
of the time-variant MC channel as a metric for characterization of the
variations of the CIR. The derived CDF is employed for calculation of the
outage probability of the system. We also show that under certain conditions,
the PDF of the CIR can be accurately approximated by a Log-normal distribution.
Based on this approximation, we derive a simple model for outdated channel
state information (CSI). Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for
evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the
considered MC system. In order to investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation
over time, we compare the performances of a detector with perfect CSI knowledge
and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the proposed
analytical expressions is verified via particle-based simulation of the

classical trajectories run on the core-excited state. The formulation of RIXS
is an extension of the semiclassical Kramers-Heisenberg (SCKH) formalism of
Ref. {Ljungberg_2010} to the resonant case, retaining approximately the same
computational cost. To overcome difficulties with connecting the absorption and

absorption, which is seen to work well provided that a zero-point-energy

  In the case of core-excited states with dissociative character the method is
capable of closely reproducing the main features for one-dimensional test
systems, compared to the quantum mechanical formulation. Due to the good
accuracy combined with the relatively low computational cost, the method has
large potential of being used for complex systems with many degrees of freedom,

study the propagation of a three-dimensional (3-D) weak shock front into a
polytropic gas in a uniform state and at rest, though the method can be
extended to shocks moving into nonuniform flows. The theory is based on the use
of 3-D kinematical conservation laws (KCL), which govern the evolution of a
surface in general and a shock front in particular. The 3-D KCL, derived purely
on geometrical considerations, form an under-determined system of conservation
laws. In the present paper the 3-D KCL system is closed by using two
appropriately truncated transport equations from an infinite hierarchy of
compatibility conditions along shock rays. The resulting governing equations of
this KCL based 3-D shock ray theory, leads to a weakly hyperbolic system of
eight conservation laws with three divergence-free constraints. The
conservation laws are solved using a Godunov-type central finite volume scheme,
with a constrained transport technique to enforce the constraints. The results
of extensive numerical simulations reveal several physically realistic
geometrical features of shock fronts and the complex structures of kink lines
formed on them. A comparison of the results with those of a weakly nonlinear
wavefront shows that a weak shock front and a weakly nonlinear wavefront are
topologically same. The major important differences between the two are
highlighted in the contexts of corrugational stability and converging shock
fronts.

different energy scales can generate various topological semi-metal phases near

crossing (QBC) with four-fold degeneracy in the paramagnetic band structure.
Due to the large band degeneracy and strong spin-orbit coupling, the degenerate
states at QBC can show an anisotropic Zeeman effect as well as the conventional
isotropic Zeeman effect. Through the competition between three different
magnetic energy scales including the exchange energy between Ir electrons and
two Zeeman energies, various topological semimetals can be generated near QCP.

controlled by modulating the magnetic multipole moment (MMM) of the cluster of

recently proven to be an effcient tool for developing nanothermometry and
experimental determination of their mode- composition. In this paper, we
develop a rigorous analytical theory based on the Green's function approach to
calculate the Raman emission from crystalline high-index dielectric
nanoparticles. As an example, we consider silicon nanoparticles which have a
strong Raman response due to active optical phonon modes. We relate enhancement
of Raman signal emission to Purcell effect due to the excitation of Mie modes
inside the nanoparticles. We also employ the numerical approach to the
calculation of inelastic Raman emission in more sophisticated geometries, which
do not allow a straightforward analytical form of the Green's function
description. The Raman response from a silicon nanodisk has been analyzed
within the proposed method, and the contribution of the various Mie modes has
been revealed.

modelling tool, the conventional Ito formula is further extended to
non-differentiable complex functions. Based on this extended Ito formula, a
detailed stochastic stability theory is developed to stabilize the SSE. Main
results of this proposed theory are sufficient conditions for stochastic

analyzing quantum system under continuous measurement, which is the first step
towards implementing weak continuous feedback control for quantum computing
purposes.

associated charged-hadron yields per J/$\psi$ trigger. A rapidity gap of at
least 1.5 units is required between the trigger J/$\psi$ and the associated
charged hadrons. Possible correlations due to collective effects are assessed
by subtracting the associated per-trigger yields in the low-multiplicity
collisions from those in the high-multiplicity collisions. After the
subtraction, we observe a strong indication of remaining symmetric structures
at $\Delta\varphi$ $\approx$ 0 and $\Delta\varphi$ $\approx$ $\pi$, similar to
those previously found in two-particle correlations at middle and forward

systematically study the problems of both GED computation, and GED verification
(i.e., verify whether the GED between two graphs is no larger than a user-given

complexities, and recommend that AStar+ is better than DFS+ by having a much
smaller search space. Extensive empirical studies validate that AStar+ performs
better than DFS+, and show that our AStar+-BMa approach outperforms the

graph-based SLAM. Because the sparsity and structure of the SLAM graph reflect
the set of incorporated measurements, many methods for sparsification have been
proposed in hopes of reducing computation. These methods often focus narrowly
on reducing edge count without regard for structure at a global level. Such
structurally-naive techniques can fail to produce significant computational
savings, even after aggressive pruning. In contrast, simple heuristics such as
measurement decimation and keyframing are known empirically to produce
significant computation reductions. To demonstrate why, we propose a
quantitative metric called elimination complexity (EC) that bridges the
existing analytic gap between graph structure and computation. EC quantifies
the complexity of the primary computational bottleneck: the factorization step
of a Gauss-Newton iteration. Using this metric, we show rigorously that
decimation and keyframing impose favorable global structures and therefore
achieve computation reductions on the order of $r^2/9$ and $r^3$, respectively,
where $r$ is the pruning rate. We additionally present numerical results
showing EC provides a good approximation of computation in both batch and
incremental (iSAM2) optimization and demonstrate that pruning methods promoting
globally-efficient structure outperform those that do not.

motivates us to propose the approach for simultaneous channel estimation and
faulty antenna detection. By exploiting the fact that the degrees of freedom of
the physical channel matrix are smaller than the number of free parameters, the
channel estimation and faulty antenna detection can be formulated as an
extended atomic norm denoising problem and solved efficiently via the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we improve the
computational efficiency by proposing a fast algorithm and show that it is a

opens unique opportunities for understanding dynamic properties of nuclei from

the computational efficiency and the robust model-space convergence of our

UnDeepVO by using stereo image pairs to recover the scale but test it by using

interactions could profoundly influence several important processes, such as
accretion variability and outbursts, fragmentation and disc truncation, or
large-scale magnetic field production. Direct numerical simulations of both
instabilities are computationally challenging and remain relatively unexplored.
In this paper, we aim to redress this neglect via a set of 3D vertically

In the limit of efficient cooling (and thus enhanced GI), the MRI is completely

gravitoturbulence. This turbulent `spiral wave' dynamo may have widespread
application, especially in galactic discs. Finally, we present preliminary work

with stochastic, non-anonymous delays and found that the regret increases only
by an additive factor relating to the expected delay. In this paper, we show
that this additive regret increase can be maintained in the harder delayed,

it) is known. We provide an algorithm that matches the worst case regret of the
non-anonymous problem exactly when the delays are bounded, and up to
logarithmic factors or an additive variance term for unbounded delays.

concerning treatment initiation. Here, one requires predicted risks assuming
that no treatment is given. This is challenging since CPMs are often derived in
datasets where patients receive treatment; moreover, treatment can commence
post-baseline - treatment drop-ins. This study presents a novel approach of
using marginal structural models (MSMs) to adjust for treatment drop-in.
  Study Design and Setting: We illustrate the use of MSMs in the CPM framework
through simulation studies, representing randomised controlled trials and
observational data. The simulations include a binary treatment and a covariate,
each recorded at two timepoints and having a prognostic effect on a binary
outcome. The bias in predicted risk was examined in a model ignoring treatment,
a model fitted on treatment na\""ive patients (at baseline), a model including
baseline treatment, and the MSM.
  Results: In all simulation scenarios, all models except the MSM
under-estimated the risk of outcome given absence of treatment. Consequently,
CPMs that do not acknowledge treatment drop-in can lead to under-allocation of
treatment.
  Conclusion: When developing CPMs to predict treatment-na\""ive risk, authors
should consider using MSMs to adjust for treatment drop-in. MSMs also allow
estimation of individual treatment effects.

evidence that the brightenings belonged to the footpoints of a microflare (MF).
The properties of the observed brightenings disqualified the scenarios of
Ellerman bombs or IRIS bombs. However, this MF shared some common properties
with flaring active-region fibrils or flaring arch filaments (FAFs): (1) FAFs
and MFs are both apparent in chromospheric and coronal layers according to the
AIA channels, and (2) both show flaring arches with lifetimes of about 3.0-3.5
min and lengths of about 20"". The inversions revealed heating by 600 K at the
footpoint location in the ambient chromosphere during the impulsive phase.
Connecting the footpoints, a dark filamentary structure appeared in the Ca II
line-core images. Before the start of the MF, the spectra of this structure
already indicated average blueshifts, meaning upward motions of the plasma
along the LOS. During the impulsive phase, these velocities increased up to
-2.2 km/s. Downflows dominated at the footpoints. However, in the upper
photosphere, slight upflows occurred during the impulsive phase. Hence,
bidirectional flows are present in the footpoints of the MF. Conclusions: We
detected Ca II brightenings that coincided with the footpoint location of an
MF. The MF event led to a rise of plasma in the upper photosphere, both before
and during the impulsive phase. Excess mass, previously raised to at most
chromospheric layers, slowly drained downward along arches toward the
footpoints of the MF.

investigates the reliability of centrality measures when missing nodes are

used centrality measures in uniform and scale-free networks in various error
scenarios. We find that centrality measures are generally more reliable when
missing nodes are likely to belong to the same community than in cases in which
nodes are missing uniformly at random. In scale-free networks, the betweenness
centrality becomes, however, less reliable when missing nodes are more likely
to belong to the same community. Moreover, centrality measures in scale-free
networks are more reliable in networks with stronger community structure. In
contrast, we do not observe this effect for uniform networks. Our observations
suggest that the impact of missing nodes on the reliability of centrality
measures might not be as severe as the literature suggests.

shells of supernova (SN) remnants, and in situ grain growth in the ISM,
although the corresponding efficiency of each of these dust formation
mechanisms at different redshifts remains a topic of debate. During the first
Gyr after the Big Bang, it is widely believed that there was not enough time to
form AGB stars in high numbers, so that the dust at this epoch is expected to
be purely from SNe, or subsequent grain growth in the ISM. The time period
corresponding to z ~5-6 is thus expected to display the transition from SN-only
dust to a mixture of both formation channels as we know it today. Here we aim
to use afterglow observations of GRBs at redshifts larger than $z > 4$ in order
to derive host galaxy dust column densities along their line-of-sight and to
test if a SN-type dust extinction curve is required for some of the bursts. GRB
afterglow observations were performed with the 7-channel GROND Detector at the
2.2m MPI telescope in La Silla, Chile and combined with data gathered with XRT.
We increase the number of measured $A_V$ values for GRBs at z > 4 by a factor
of ~2-3 and find that, in contrast to samples at mostly lower redshift, all of
the GRB afterglows have a visual extinction of $A_V$ < 0.5 mag. Analysis of the
GROND detection thresholds and results from a Monte-Carlo simulation show that,
although we partly suffer from an observational bias against highly
extinguished sight-lines, GRB host galaxies at 4 < z < 6 seem to contain on
average less dust than at z ~ 2. Additionally, we find that all of the GRBs can
be modeled with locally measured extinction curves and that the SN-like dust
extinction curve provides a better fit for only two of the afterglow SEDs. For
the first time we also report a photometric redshift of $z = 7.88$ for GRB
100905A, making it one of the most distant GRBs known to date.

the stellar mass function at different distances from the cluster centre. The

knowledge which can be used for clinical decision support (CDS). Our objective
is a general system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in
EMRs to support three CDS tasks: test recommendation, initial diagnosis, and
treatment plan recommendation, with the given condition of one patient.
Methods: We extracted four kinds of medical entities from records and
constructed an EMR-based medical knowledge network (EMKN), in which nodes are
entities and edges reflect their co-occurrence in a single record. Three
bipartite subgraphs (bi-graphs) were extracted from the EMKN to support each
task. One part of the bi-graph was the given condition (e.g., symptoms), and
the other was the condition to be inferred (e.g., diseases). Each bi-graph was
regarded as a Markov random field to support the inference. Three lazy energy
functions and one parameter-based energy function were proposed, as well as two
knowledge representation learning-based energy functions, which can provide a
distributed representation of medical entities. Three measures were utilized
for performance evaluation. Results: On the initial diagnosis task, 80.11% of
the test records identified at least one correct disease from top 10
candidates. Test and treatment recommendation results were 87.88% and 92.55%,
respectively. These results altogether indicate that the proposed system
outperformed the baseline methods. The distributed representation of medical
entities does reflect similarity relationships in regards to knowledge level.
Conclusion: Combining EMKN and MRF is an effective approach for general medical
knowledge representation and inference. Different tasks, however, require
designing their energy functions individually.

they form an ideal set for mechanistic investigation. Starting with the results

models, which are based on CASPT2//CASSCF level of QM theory, reproduce the
observed absorption trend with only a limited blue-shift of 4.5 kcal/mol and
emission trend with even smaller blue-shift of 1.5 kcal/mol. Using CASSCF QM/MM
calculations we analyze the chromophore's charge-transfer patterns during the
absorption and emission, which, in turn trigger a cascade of
hydrogen-bond-network rearrangements indicating a preparation to an
isomerization event. We also show how the contribution of individual aminoacids
to the chromophore conformational changes correlates with spectral tuning of
the absorption and emission. Furthermore, we identify how the conical
intersection topography correlates with protein's photophysical properties. In

Sybils, which are collectively managed by a group of real users. A new advanced
scheme, which we term elite Sybil attacks, recruits organically highly-rated
accounts to generate seemingly-trustworthy and realistic-looking reviews. These
elite Sybil accounts taken together form a large-scale sparsely-knit Sybil
network for which existing Sybil fake-review defense systems are unlikely to
succeed. In this paper, we conduct the first study to define, characterize, and
detect elite Sybil attacks. We show that contemporary elite Sybil attacks have
a hybrid architecture, with the first tier recruiting elite Sybil workers and
distributing tasks by Sybil organizers, and with the second tier posting fake
reviews for profit by elite Sybil workers. We design ElsieDet, a three-stage
Sybil detection scheme, which first separates out suspicious groups of users,
then identifies the campaign windows, and finally identifies elite Sybil users
participating in the campaigns. We perform a large-scale empirical study on ten
million reviews from Dianping, by far the most popular URSN service in China.
Our results show that reviews from elite Sybil users are more spread out
temporally, craft more convincing reviews, and have higher filter bypass rates.
We also measure the impact of Sybil campaigns on various industries (such as

monitoring elite Sybil users over time can provide valuable early alerts

in granules and weaker downflows in intergranular lanes. This trend is,
however, inconsistent with the results of numerical simulations in which
downflows are stronger than upflows through the joint action of gravitational
acceleration/deceleration and pressure gradients. One cause of this discrepancy
is the image degradation caused by optical distortion and light diffraction and

attacks an area by: (i) remotely disconnecting some lines within the attacked

of soft matter. However, accurate and rapid computations of the hydrodynamic
interactions between suspended, microscopic components in a soft material is a
significant computational challenge. Here, we present a new method for Brownian
Dynamics simulations of suspended colloidal scale particles subject to an
important class of hydrodynamic constraints with practically linear scaling of
the computational cost with the number of particles modeled. Specifically, we
consider the ""stresslet"" constraint for which suspended particles resist local
deformation. The presented method is an extension of the recently reported
positively-split formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa
(RPY) mobility tensor to higher order (dipole) terms in the hydrodynamic
scattering series [Andrew M. Fiore et al. The Journal of Chemical Physics,
146(12):124116, 2017]. The hydrodynamic mobility tensor, which is proportional
to the covariance of particle Brownian displacements, is constructed as an
Ewald sum in a novel way that guarantees the real-space and wave-space sums are
independently positive-definite for all possible particle configurations. This
property is leveraged to rapidly sample the Brownian displacements from a
superposition of statistically independent processes with the wave-space and
real-space contributions as respective covariances. The cost of computing the
Brownian displacements in this way is comparable to the cost of computing the
deterministic displacements. Addition of a stresslet constraint to the
over-damped particle equations of motion leads to a stochastic differential
algebraic equation (SDAE) of index 1, which is integrated in time using a
mid-point integration scheme that implicitly produces displacements consistent
with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the constrained system.

be captured in signed graphs. The {\em edge sign prediction problem} aims to
predict whether an interaction between a pair of nodes will be positive or
negative. We provide theoretical results for this problem that motivate natural
improvements to recent heuristics.
  The edge sign prediction problem is related to correlation clustering; a
positive relationship means being in the same cluster. We consider the
following model for two clusters: we are allowed to query any pair of nodes
whether they belong to the same cluster or not, but the answer to the query is
corrupted with some probability $0<q<\frac{1}{2}$. Let $\delta=1-2q$ be the
bias. We provide an algorithm that recovers all signs correctly with high
probability in the presence of noise with $O(\frac{n\log
n}{\delta^2}+\frac{\log^2 n}{\delta^6})$ queries. This is the best known result
for this problem for all but tiny $\delta$, improving on the recent work of
Mazumdar and Saha \cite{mazumdar2017clustering}. We also provide an algorithm
that performs $O(\frac{n\log n}{\delta^4})$ queries, and uses breadth first
search as its main algorithmic primitive. While both the running time and the
number of queries for this algorithm are sub-optimal, our result relies on
novel theoretical techniques, and naturally suggests the use of edge-disjoint
paths as a feature for predicting signs in online social networks.
Correspondingly, we experiment with using edge disjoint $s-t$ paths of short
length as a feature for predicting the sign of edge $(s,t)$ in real-world
signed networks. Empirical findings suggest that the use of such paths improves
the classification accuracy, especially for pairs of nodes with no common
neighbors.

argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of
an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or
wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by
biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing
a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to
authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial
results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can
provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with
limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital
separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as
age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual.
Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to
yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series
data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication
at the level of an individual.

this study, we propose to leverage the correlation from multiple heterogeneous

propose a novel recovery algorithm---built upon belief-propagation

becomes more challenging in unconstrained environment and in the presence of
several variations like pose, illumination, expression, etc. Local descriptors
are widely used for this task. The most of the existing local descriptors
consider only few immediate local neighbors and not able to utilize the wider
local information to make the descriptor more discriminative. The wider local
information based descriptors mainly suffer due to the increased
dimensionality. In this paper, this problem is solved by encoding the
relationship among directional neighbors in an efficient manner. The
relationship between the center pixel and the encoded directional neighbors is
utilized further to form the proposed local directional relation pattern
(LDRP). The descriptor is inherently uniform illumination invariant. The
multi-scale mechanism is also adapted to further boost the discriminative
ability of the descriptor. The proposed descriptor is evaluated under the image
retrieval framework over face databases. Very challenging databases like PaSC,
LFW, PubFig, ESSEX, FERET, AT&T, and FaceScrub are used to test the
discriminative ability and robustness of LDRP descriptor. Results are also
compared with the recent state-of-the-art face descriptors such as LBP, LTP,

the proposed descriptor over very appealing face databases as compared to the

pre-trained ImageNet CNN models over large-scale FaceScrub face dataset.
Moreover, it also outperforms the deep learning based DLib face descriptor in

fields in the sense of Semple and Whittle. We then define matroids over tracts;
in fact, there are (at least) two natural notions of matroid in this general

sufficient criteria for the notions of weak and strong matroids to coincide.

proportional to the magnetization, and thus observed only in ferromagnets,
while recent theories indicate that ANE provides a measure of the Berry
curvature at the Fermi energy $E_{\rm F}$. Here we report the observation of a
large ANE at zero field in the chiral antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Despite a very
small magnetization $\sim 0.002$ $\mu_{\rm B}/$Mn, the transverse Seebeck
coefficient at zero field is $\sim 0.35~\mu$V/K at room temperature and reaches
$\sim 0.6~\mu$V/K at 200 K, comparable with the maximum value known for a
ferromagnetic metal. Our first-principles calculation reveals that the large
ANE comes from a significantly enhanced Berry curvature associated with the
Weyl points nearby $E_{\rm F}$. The ANE is geometrically convenient for the
thermoelectric power generation, as it enables a lateral configuration of the
modules to efficiently cover the heat source. Our observation of the large ANE
in an antiferromagnet paves a way to develop a new class of thermoelectric

supporting the 5G mobile system. By deploying more small cells in a fixed area,
the average distance between users and access points can be significantly
reduced, hence a dense spatial frequency reuse can be exploited. However,
severe interference is the major obstacle in UDN. Most of the contributions
deal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This paper
advocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDN, thanks
to the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN,
centralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission.
We summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs. One of the most
challenging issues is the requirement of the global CSI for the sake of
cooperative transmission. We investigate this requirement by only relying on
partial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the
estimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot
allocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising
research directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with
special emphasis on the application of the `big data' techniques.
