and define simple to compute features for each voxel in the scan. The two scans
that need to be aligned are considered as a collection of these features and
the MI between these voxelized features is maximized to obtain the correct
alignment of scans. We have implemented our method with various simple point
cloud features (such as number of points in voxel, variance of z-height in
voxel) and compared the performance of the proposed method with existing
point-to-point and point-to- distribution registration methods. We show that
our approach has an efficient and fast parallel implementation on GPU, and
evaluate the robustness and speed of the proposed algorithm on two real-world
datasets which have variety of dynamic scenes from different environments.

caching infrastructure during off-peak hours in an error-free manner; however,
this assumption is not applicable if local caches need to be frequently updated
via wireless transmission. This paper investigates a new approach to wireless
caching for the case when cache content has to be updated during on-peak hours.
Two non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted caching strategies are
developed, namely the push-then-deliver strategy and the push-and-deliver
strategy. In the push-then-deliver strategy, the NOMA principle is applied to
push more content files to the content servers during a short time interval
reserved for content pushing in on-peak hours and to provide more connectivity
for content delivery, compared to the conventional orthogonal multiple access
(OMA) strategy. The push-and-deliver strategy is motivated by the fact that
some users' requests cannot be accommodated locally and the base station has to
serve them directly. These events during the content delivery phase are
exploited as opportunities for content pushing, which further facilitates the
frequent update of the files cached at the content servers. It is also shown
that this strategy can be straightforwardly extended to device-to-device
caching, and various analytical results are developed to illustrate the
superiority of the proposed caching strategies compared to OMA based schemes.

technology for building a quantum computer, with all the elementary operations
having been achieved with the necessary precision for some error-correction
schemes. However, the essential two-qubit logic gate used for generating
quantum entanglement has hitherto always been performed in an adiabatic regime,
where the gate is slow compared with the characteristic motional frequencies of
ions in the trap, giving logic speeds of order 10kHz. There have been numerous
proposals for performing gates faster than this natural ""speed limit"" of the
trap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored laser
pulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along
trajectories designed such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical
phase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate) quantum logic which is robust
to this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement
generation for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single
oscillation period of an ion in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter
than the memory coherence time measured in similar calcium-43 hyperfine qubits.
The method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where it yields
a gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for
example, we achieve a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%. Still faster gates are
possible at the price of higher laser intensity. The method requires only a
single amplitude-shaped pulse and one pair of beams derived from a
continuous-wave laser, and offers the prospect of combining the unrivalled
coherence properties, operation fidelities and optical connectivity of
trapped-ion qubits with the sub-microsecond logic speeds usually associated

fluorescence and phosphorescence of molecule aggregate structures on surfaces
in a spatially correlative way. We consider as two morphologies, lengthy
strands and isotropic islands. It turns out that phosphorescence is quite
strong compared to fluorescence and the spatial variation of the observed
intensities is largely in line with the amount of dye. However in proportion,
the strands exhibit more fluorescence than the isotropic islands suggesting
weaker non-radiative channels. The ratio fluorescence to phosphorescence
appears to be correlated with the degree of aggregation or internal order. The
heights at which luminescence saturates is explained in the context of
attenuation and emission multireflection, inside the dye. This is supported by
correlative photoemission electron microscopy which is more sensitive to the
surface region. The lengthy structures exhibit a pronounced polarization
dependence of the luminescence with a relative dichroism up to about 60%,
revealing substantial perpendicular orientation preference of the molecules

the latter can become adsorbing (the transition to the synchrony becomes
unidirectional). The dependence of the temporal dynamics of the transition on
the system parameters is investigated. For nonidentical oscillators the perfect
synchrony state becomes impossible and an absorbing state disappears; on its
place, only a weakly stable state of imperfect synchrony remains. A nontrivial
effect of the divergence of individual frequencies of oscillators with
different natural frequencies is revealed and studied for moderate repelling
coupling; meanwhile, the order parameter remains non-small for this case. In
Appendix we provide an introduction to the theories of Ott-Antonsen and
Watanabe-Strogatz.

brightness (SB) profiles remains contentious. Here, we assess the importance of
stellar radial motions in shaping their characteristics. Methods: We use the
simulated Milky Way-mass, cosmological discs, from the Ramses Disc Environment
Study (RaDES) to characterise the radial redistribution of stars in galaxies
displaying type I (pure exponentials), II (downbending), and III (upbending) SB
profiles. We compare radial profiles of the mass fractions and the velocity
dispersions of different sub-populations of stars according to their birth and
current locations. Results: Radial redistribution of stars is important in all
galaxies regardless of their light profiles. Type II breaks seem to be a
consequence of the combined effects of outward-moving and accreted stars. The
former produces shallower inner profiles (lack of stars in the inner disc) and
accumulate material around the break radius and beyond, strengthening the
break; the latter can weaken or even convert the break into a pure exponential.
Further accretion from satellites can concentrate material in the outermost
parts, leading to type III breaks that can coexist with type II breaks, but
situated further out. Type III galaxies would be the result of an important
radial redistribution of material throughout the entire disc, as well as a
concentration of accreted material in the outskirts. In addition, type III
galaxies display the most efficient radial redistribution and the largest
number of accreted stars, followed by type I and II systems, suggesting that
type I galaxies may be an intermediate case between types II and III. In
general, the velocity dispersion profiles of all galaxies tend to flatten or
even ncrease around the locations where the breaks are found. The age and
metallicity profiles are also affected, exhibiting...[abridged]

of sight of an observer. The refracted light forms a stellar mirage, a
distorted secondary image of the host star. I model this phenomenon and the
resultant out-of-transit flux increase across a comprehensive exoplanetary
parameter space. At visible wavelengths, Rayleigh scattering limits the
detectability of stellar mirages in most exoplanetary systems with semi-major
axes $\lesssim$6 AU. A notable exception is almost any planet orbiting a late M
or ultra-cool dwarf star at $\gtrsim$0.5 AU, where the maximum relative flux
increase is greater than 50 parts-per-million. Based partly on previous work, I
propose that the importance of refraction in an exoplanet system is governed by
two angles: the orbital distance divided by the stellar radius and the total
deflection achieved by a ray in the optically thin portion of the atmosphere.
Atmospheric lensing events caused by non-transiting exoplanets, which allow for
exoplanet detection and atmospheric characterization, are also investigated. I
derive the basic formalism to determine the total signal-to-noise ratio of an
atmospheric lensing event, with application to Kepler data. It is unlikely that
out-of-transit refracted light signals are clearly present in Kepler data due
to Rayleigh scattering and the bias toward short-period exoplanets. However,
observations at long wavelengths (e.g., the near-infrared) are significantly
more likely to detect stellar mirages. Lastly, I discuss the potential for the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to detect refracted light and consider
novel science cases enabled by refracted light spectra from the James Webb

whose rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra show strong nitrogen broad emission

the equivalent width (EW) of the [OIII]5007 emission line: if the NLR
metallicity is remarkably high as suggested by strong UV nitrogen lines, the
[OIII]5007 line flux should be very week due to the low equilibrium temperature
of the ionized gas owing to significant metal cooling. In the result, we found
that our spectra show moderate EW of the [OIII]5007 line similar to general
quasars. This indicates nitrogen-loud quasars do not have extremely metal-rich
gas clouds in NLRs. This suggests that strong nitrogen lines from broad-line
regions (BLRs) are originated by exceptionally high abundances of nitrogen
relative to oxygen without very high BLR metallicities. This result indicates
that broad-emission lines of nitrogen are not good indicators of the BLR
metallicity in some cases. On the other hand, we also investigate virial
black-hole masses and Eddington ratios by using the Hbeta and CIV1549 lines for
our sample. As a result, we found that black-hole masses and Eddington ratios
of nitrogen-loud quasars tend to be low and high relative to normal quasars,
suggesting that nitrogen-loud quasars seem to be in a rapidly-accreting phase.
This can be explained in terms of a positive correlation between Eddington
ratios and nitrogen abundances of quasars, that is probably caused by the
connection between the mass accretion onto black holes and nuclear star
formation.

in the Coma cluster. Here we present optical spectra of three such UDGs, DF7,
DF44 and DF17, which have central surface brightnesses of $\mu_g \approx
24.4-25.1$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The spectra were acquired as part of an ancillary
program within the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey. We stacked 19 fibers in the central
regions from larger integral field units (IFUs) per source. With over 13.5
hours of on-source integration we achieved a mean signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)
in the optical of $9.5$\AA$^{-1}$, $7.9$\AA$^{-1}$ and $5.0$\AA$^{-1}$,
respectively, for DF7, DF44 and DF17. Stellar population models applied to
these spectra enable measurements of recession velocities, ages and
metallicities. The recession velocities of DF7, DF44 and DF17 are
$6599^{+40}_{-25}$km/s, $6402^{+41}_{-39}$km/s and $8315^{+43}_{-43}$km/s,
spectroscopically confirming that all of them reside in the Coma cluster. The
stellar populations of these three galaxies are old and metal-poor, with ages
of $7.9^{+3.6}_{-2.5}$Gyr, $8.9^{+4.3}_{-3.3}$Gyr and $9.1^{+3.9}_{-5.5}$Gyr,
and iron abundances of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ $-1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$,
$-1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ and $-0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$, respectively. Their stellar
masses are $3$-$6\times10^8 M_\odot$. The UDGs in our sample are as old or
older than galaxies at similar stellar mass or velocity dispersion (only DF44
has an independently measured dispersion). They all follow the well-established
stellar mass$-$stellar metallicity relation, while DF44 lies below the velocity
dispersion-metallicity relation. These results, combined with the fact that
UDGs are unusually large for their stellar mass, suggest that stellar mass
plays a more important role in setting stellar population properties for these
galaxies than either size or surface brightness.

eccentric dust belt. This eccentric dust belt has often been interpreted as the
dynamical signature of one or more planets that elude direct detection.
However, the system also contains two other stellar companions residing
~100,000 AU from Fomalhaut A. We have designed a new symplectic integration
algorithm to model the evolution of Fomalhaut A's planetary dust belt in
concert with the dynamical evolution of its stellar companions to determine if
these companions are likely to have generated the dust belt's morphology. Using
our numerical simulations, we find that close encounters between Fomalhaut A
and B are expected, with a ~25% probability that the two stars have passed
within at least 400 AU of each other at some point. Although the outcomes of
such encounter histories are extremely varied, these close encounters nearly
always excite the eccentricity of Fomalhaut A's dust belt and occasionally
yield morphologies very similar to the observed belt. With these results, we
argue that close encounters with Fomalhaut A's stellar companions should be
considered a plausible mechanism to explain its eccentric belt, especially in
the absence of detected planets capable of sculpting the belt's morphology.

as the blade-vortex interactions generated by helicopter rotors. We present
several tests of Lerat et al.'s vorticity-preserving approach, which we have

other algorithms that are frequently used in protostellar disk simulations. The

applied to the Millennium Simulation, scaled to a Planck cosmology. We show
that the model reproduces the observed behaviour of the star formation history
(SFH) both in protoclusters and the field. The rate of star formation peaks
$\sim0.7\,{\rm Gyr}$ earlier in protoclusters than in the field and declines
more rapidly afterwards. This results in protocluster galaxies forming
significantly earlier: 80% of their stellar mass is already formed by $z=1.4$,
but only 45% of the field stellar mass has formed by this time. The model
predicts that field and protocluster galaxies have similar average specific
star-formation rates (sSFR) at $z>3$, and we find evidence of an enhancement of
star formation in the dense protoclusters at early times. At $z<3$,
protoclusters have lower sSFRs, resulting in the disparity between the SFHs. We
show that the stellar mass functions of protoclusters are top-heavy compared
with the field due to the early formation of massive galaxies, and the
disruption and merging of low-mass satellite galaxies in the main haloes. The
fundamental cause of the different SFHs and mass functions is that dark matter
haloes are biased tracers of the dark matter density field: the high density of
haloes and the top-heavy halo mass function in protoclusters result in the
early formation then rapid merging and quenching of galaxies. We compare our
results with observations from the literature, and highlight which observables
provide the most informative tests of galaxy formation.

moderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with an
orbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companion
via a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<
4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which
indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =
-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}
=7500 \pm 110\,\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\mathrm{M_*} =
1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \pm
0.10\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \pm
0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times
10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibrium
temperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo and
complete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm
2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared to
other stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced
in metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely an
Am star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transiting
planet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal
the existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at a
projected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity
measurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to
have stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow
rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to
have caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the
transiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.

components of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The torus can be studied by
analyzing the time response of its infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in
the AGN continuum luminosity, a technique known as reverberation mapping. The
IR response is the convolution of the AGN ultraviolet/optical light curve with
a transfer function that contains information about the size, geometry, and
structure of the torus. Here, we describe a new computer model that simulates
the reverberation response of a clumpy torus. Given an input optical light
curve, the code computes the emission of a 3D ensemble of dust clouds as a
function of time at selected IR wavelengths, taking into account light travel
delays. We present simulated dust emission responses at 3.6, 4.5, and 30 $\mu$m
that explore the effects of various geometrical and structural properties, dust
cloud orientation, and anisotropy of the illuminating radiation field. We also
briefly explore the effects of cloud shadowing (clouds are shielded from the
AGN continuum source). Example synthetic light curves have also been generated,
using the observed optical light curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 6418 as the
input. The torus response is strongly wavelength-dependent, due to the gradient
in cloud surface temperature within the torus, and because the cloud emission
is strongly anisotropic at shorter wavelengths. Anisotropic illumination of the
torus also significantly modifies the torus response, reducing the lag between
the IR and optical variations.

been visually classified according to the interaction with their host,
representing different evolutionary stages. We have included clearly disrupted
galaxies, galaxies that despite not showing signs of interaction are located
close to a massive neighbor (thus are good candidates for a stripping process),
and cEs with no host nearby. For the latter, tidal stripping is less likely to
have happened and instead they could simply represent the very low-mass, faint
end of the ellipticals. We study a set of properties (structural parameters,
stellar populations, star formation histories and mass ratios) that can be used
to discriminate between an intrinsic or stripped origin. We find that one
diagnostic tool alone is inconclusive for the majority of objects. However, if
we combine all the tools a clear picture emerges. The most plausible origin, as
well as the evolutionary stage and progenitor type, can be then determined. Our
results favor the stripping mechanism for those galaxies in groups and clusters

rare cEs without a plausible host and that are located in looser environments.

fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phases that form in two-dimensional electron

experimental approach to directly visualize the structure of interacting

Our theoretical calculations show how spectroscopy mapping with the STM near

merger, dividing disk-like galaxies further into unbarred, weakly-barred and
strongly-barred, assuming a simple exponentially-decaying star formation
history model and based on the H$_{\delta}$ absorption feature and the $4000$
\AA ~break. We find that different morphological types present different star
formation quenching timescales, reinforcing the idea that the galaxy morphology
is strongly correlated with the physical processes responsible for quenching
star formation. Our quantification of the star formation quenching timescale
indicates that disks have typical timescales $60\%$ to 5 times longer than that
of galaxies presenting spheroidal, irregular or merger morphologies. Barred
galaxies in particular present the slowest transition timescales through the
green valley. This suggests that although secular evolution may ultimately lead
to gas exhaustion in the host galaxy via bar-induced gas inflows that trigger
star formation activity, secular agents are not major contributors in the rapid
quenching of galaxies at these redshifts. Galaxy interaction, associated with
the elliptical, irregular and merger morphologies contribute, to a more
significant degree, to the fast transition through the green valley at these
redshifts. In the light of previous works suggesting that both secular and

brightest LABs at $z\sim0.3$, SDSS J0113$+$0106 (J0113) and SDSS J1155$-$0147
(J1155), comparable in size and luminosity to `B1', one of the best-studied
LABs at $z \gtrsim$ 2. Our NuSTAR hard X-ray (3--30 keV) observations reveal
powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) with $L_{2-10{\;\rm

factor of $\sim 5$ between 2014 and 2016, emphasizing that variable AGN may
cause apparent ionization deficits in LABs. Joint spectral analyses including
Chandra data constrain column densities of $N_{\rm

a torus with a narrow ionization cone, but ionizing radiation is also leaking
in other directions as revealed by our Gemini/GMOS 3D spectroscopy. The latter
shows a bipolar outflow over $10$ kpc, with a peculiar velocity profile that is
best explained by AGN flickering. X-ray analysis of J1155 reveals a weakly
absorbed AGN that may ionize over a wide solid angle, consistent with our 3D
spectra. Extinction corrected [OIII] log-luminosities are high, $\sim43.6$. The
velocity dispersions are low, $\sim100$--$150$ km s$^{-1}$, even at the AGN
positions. We argue that this is a combination of high extinction hiding the

as if there is no interaction between them. In general, if a lattice can be
divided into two disconnected regions separated by an interface of sites with
zero applied field, we can guarantee a similar result only if the surface
contains a single site. Already for an interface with two sites we show an

turbulence in protoplanetary disks, although its turbulence strength and
accretion stress remains debatable because of the uncertainty of MRI with low
ionization fraction. We focus on the heating of electrons by strong electric
fields which amplifies nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects. The heated
electrons frequently collide with and stick to dust grains, which in turn
decreases the ionization fraction and is expected to weaken the turbulent
motion driven by MRI. In order to quantitatively investigate the nonlinear
evolution of MRI including the electron heating, we perform
magnetohydrodynamical simulation with the unstratified shearing box. We
introduce a simple analytic resistivity model depending on the current density
by mimicking resistivity given by the calculation of ionization. Our simulation
confirms that the electron heating suppresses magnetic turbulence when the
electron heating occurs with low current density. We find a clear correlation
between magnetic stress and its current density, which means that the magnetic
stress is proportional to the squared current density. When the turbulent
motion is completely suppressed, laminar accretion flow is caused by ordered
magnetic field. We give an analytical description of the laminar state by using
a solution of linear perturbation equations with resistivity. We also propose a
formula that successfully predicts the accretion stress in the presence of the
electron heating.

rate of downconverted light emission, dictated by the properties of
low-symmetry nonlinear crystals, is typically very small, leading to
significant constrains in device design and integration. In this paper, we show
that the principles for spontaneous emission control (i.e. Purcell effect) of
isolated emitters in nanoscale structures, such as metamaterials, can be
generalized to describe the enhancement of nonlinear light generation processes
such as parametric down conversion. We develop a novel theoretical framework
for quantum nonlinear emission in a general anisotropic, dispersive and lossy
media. We further find that spontaneous parametric downconversion in media with
hyperbolic dispersion is broadband and phase-mismatch-free. We predict a
1000-fold enhancement of the downconverted emission rate with up to 105 photon
pairs per second in experimentally realistic nanostructures. Our theoretical
formalism and approach to Purcell enhancement of nonlinear optical processes,
provides a framework for description of quantum nonlinear optical phenomena in

analyzed absorption components shows a striking underabundance of Ti and Mn in
the gas-phase, indicating the effect of dust depletion for these elements and a
locally enhanced dust-to-gas ratio. In this DLA and in other similar absorbers,
the MnII abundance follows that of TiII very closely, implying that both ions
are equally sensitive to the dust depletion effects. Our analysis indicates
that the DLA toward PKS 1127$-$145 has multiple origins. With its narrow line
width and its strong dust depletion, component 3 points toward the presence of
a neutral gas disk from a faint LSB galaxy in front of PKS 1127$-$145, while

asymptotic consistency even if the intra-subject dependency is dense. For

magnetoelectric switching results in lower energy and shorter switching time
than other mechanisms. Magnetoelectric (ME) field due to exchange bias at the
interface with a multi-ferroic (such as BiFeO3) is well suited for 180 degree
switching of magnetization. The ME field is determined by the direction of
canted magnetization in BiFeO3 which can point at an angle to the plane, to
which voltage is applied. Dependence of switching time and the threshold of ME
field on its angles was determined by micromagnetic simulations. Switching
occurs by formation of a domain wall on the side of the nanomagnet on top of
BFO and its propagation to the rest of the magnet. For in-plane magnetization,
switching occurs over a wide range of angles and at all magnitudes of ME field
above threshold. For out-of-plane magnetization failure occurs (with an

conclude that within time-symmetric quantum mechanics and under certain

life. Especially prone to accretion, extrasolar planets in short-period orbits,
while relatively rare, constitute a significant fraction of the known
population, and these planets are subject to dynamical and atmospheric
influences that can drive significant mass loss. Theoretical models frame
expectations regarding the rates and extent of this planetary accretion. For
instance, tidal interactions between planets and stars may drive complete
orbital decay during the main sequence. Many planets that survive their stars'
main sequence lifetime will still be engulfed when the host stars become red
giant stars. There is some observational evidence supporting these predictions,
such as a dearth of close-in planets around fast stellar rotators, which is
consistent with tidal spin-up and planet accretion. There remains no clear
chemical evidence for pollution of the atmospheres of main sequence or red
giant stars by planetary materials, but a wealth of evidence points to active
accretion by white dwarfs. In this article, we review the current understanding
of accretion of planetary material, from the pre- to the post-main sequence and
beyond. The review begins with the astrophysical framework for that process and
then considers accretion during various phases of a host star's life, during
which the details of accretion vary, and the observational evidence for
accretion during these phases.

n=0-3, \text{H}_2(v), v=0-14, \text{H}^+, \text{H}_2^+, \text{H}_3^+,

to verify in a simple and straightforward manner whether a given
penalty/augmented Lagrangian function is exact, i.e. whether the problem of
unconstrained minimization of this function is equivalent (in some sense) to
the original constrained problem, provided the penalty parameter is
sufficiently large. Our approach is based on the so-called localization
principle that reduces the study of global exactness to a local analysis of a
chosen merit function near globally optimal solutions. In turn, such local
analysis can usually be performed with the use of sufficient optimality

for the global exactness of a continuously differentiable penalty function for

The observation and measurement of the frequencies (or velocities) of
oscillations of the principal modes on the surface of the Sun allow us to study
the internal properties of the star. In our study, we use a local helioseismic
method, called ""Time-Distance""; the latter, after appropriate treatment
(remapping, tracking, and filtering) of the data, which carried out from the
GONG (Global Oscillation Network Group) observation network, allows us to
deduce, by correlation of the observed signals, the relationship between the
time of the wave path and its crossed distance (hence the name of the method)
between different points on the surface as a function of the different solar
sub-surface parameters, via the dispersion relation. Once the travel times have
been established by approximation of the correlation function by a Gaussian
wave packet and based on the Fermat principle dealing with acoustic waves, we
find the relationship between these times and the internal parameters of the
crossed medium. Two models are considered in this study. The first does not
include the effects of the magnetic field and takes into account the flow
velocity and the sound speed. The second, on the other hand, includes the
magnetic effects, by means of the Alfven velocity (magnetic field perturbation
velocity), in addition to the parameters mentioned above. The last part of this
paper was devoted to the inversion of the obtained times, which allows us to go

between 0.005 and a few g/cm$^3$ and temperatures between $1000$ K and $15000$
K. We provide analytical fits from which the Rayleigh cross section of fluid
helium can be easily calculated at wavelength $\lambda>505.35$ \AA.
Collision-induced light scattering was estimated to be the dominant scattering
process at densities greater than 1-2 g/cm$^3$ depending on the temperature.

into the domain of transfer learning, since we are using a model trained on a

another classification problem using another disjoint set of images. It's
challenging as no direct depth information is provided. Though depth estimation
has been well studied, none have attempted to aid image classification with
estimated depth. Therefore, we present a way of transferring domain knowledge
on depth estimation to a separate image classification task over a disjoint set
of train, and test data. We build a RGBD dataset based on RGB dataset and do
image classification on it. Then evaluation the performance of neural networks
on the RGBD dataset compared to the RGB dataset. From our experiments, the
benefit is significant with shallow and deep networks. It improves ResNet-20 by
0.55% and ResNet-56 by 0.53%. Our code and dataset are available publicly.

connectivity, to support increasingly resource intensive user applications.
Network hyper-densification therefore becomes necessary, though connecting to
the Internet tens of thousands of base stations is non-trivial, especially in
urban scenarios where optical fibre is difficult and costly to deploy. The
millimetre wave (mm-wave) spectrum is a promising candidate for inexpensive
multi-Gbps wireless backhauling, but exploiting this band for effective
multi-hop data communications is challenging. In particular, resource
allocation and scheduling of very narrow transmission/ reception beams requires
to overcome terminal deafness and link blockage problems, while managing
fairness issues that arise when flows encounter dissimilar competition and
traverse different numbers of links with heterogeneous quality. In this paper,
we propose WiHaul, an airtime allocation and scheduling mechanism that
overcomes these challenges specific to multi-hop mm-wave networks, guarantees
max-min fairness among traffic flows, and ensures the overall available
backhaul resources are fully utilised. We evaluate the proposed WiHaul scheme
over a broad range of practical network conditions, and demonstrate up to 5
times individual throughput gains and a fivefold improvement in terms of
measurable fairness, over recent mm-wave scheduling solutions.

oscillations are modified by Standard-Model neutral- and charged-current
interactions with electrons. Theories beyond the Standard Model introduce
heavy, TeV-scale bosons that can produce nonstandard neutrino interactions.
These additional interactions may modify the Standard Model matter effect
producing a measurable deviation from the prediction for atmospheric neutrino
oscillations. The result described in this paper constrains nonstandard
interaction parameters, building upon a previous analysis of atmospheric
muon-neutrino disappearance with three years of IceCube-DeepCore data. The best
fit for the muon to tau flavor changing term is $\epsilon_{\mu \tau}=-0.0005$,
with a 90\% C.L. allowed range of $-0.0067 <\epsilon_{\mu \tau}< 0.0081$. This
result is more restrictive than recent limits from other experiments for
$\epsilon_{\mu \tau}$. Furthermore, our result is complementary to a recent
constraint on $\epsilon_{\mu \tau}$ using another publicly available IceCube
high-energy event selection. Together, they constitute the world's best limits
on nonstandard interactions in the $\mu-\tau$ sector.

Copyright: 2017 INFORMS",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, the paradigm of cloud computing has emerged as an
architecture for computing that makes use of distributed (networked) computing
resources. In this paper, we consider a distributed computing algorithmic
scheme for stochastic optimization which relies on modest communication
requirements amongst processors and most importantly, does not require
synchronization. Specifically, we analyze a scheme with $N>1$ independent
threads implementing each a stochastic gradient algorithm. The threads are
coupled via a perturbation of the gradient (with attractive and repulsive
forces) in a similar manner to mathematical models of flocking, swarming and
other group formations found in nature with mild communication requirements.
When the objective function is convex, we show that a flocking-like approach
for distributed stochastic optimization provides a noise reduction effect
similar to that of a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the
average of $N$ gradient samples at each step. The distributed nature of
flocking makes it an appealing computational alternative. We show that when the
overhead related to the time needed to gather $N$ samples and synchronization
is not negligible, the flocking implementation outperforms a centralized
stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at
each step. When the objective function is not convex, the flocking-based
approach seems better suited to escape locally optimal solutions due to the
repulsive force which enforces a certain level of diversity in the set of
candidate solutions. Here again, we show that the noise reduction effect is
similar to that associated to the centralized stochastic gradient algorithm
based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at each step.

are then existentially quantified from the deterministic structure in linear

constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model
of non-linear galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we
construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation
$\xi_{\text{gg}}(r)$ and galaxy-matter cross-correlation $\xi_{\text{gm}}(r)$
as a function of $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, and halo occupation distribution (HOD)
parameters, which are allowed to vary with large scale environment to represent
possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial
case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak
lensing (effective source density $\sim 0.3$ arcmin$^{-2}$). Using tangential
shear and projected correlation function measurements over $0.5 \leq r_p \leq
30 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc yields a 1.8% constraint on the parameter combination

excludes non-linear scales ($r_p > 2 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc, $4 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc for
$\gamma_t,w_p$). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering
information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters that would
otherwise degrade the inference of matter clustering from GGL. Increasing the
effective source density to $3$ arcmin$^{-2}$ sharpens the constraint on
$\sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.58}$ by a further factor of two. With robust modeling into
the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the

because it does not consider which parts of program inputs should not be

FairFuzz, that helps alleviate this limitation in two key steps. First,
FairFuzz automatically prioritizes inputs exercising rare parts of the program
under test. Second, it automatically adjusts the mutation of inputs so that the
mutated inputs are more likely to exercise these same rare parts of the
program. We conduct evaluation on real-world programs against state-of-the-art

relationships among variables. We used loess and bootstrapped confidence
interval to subjectively identify the number and positions of potential
ecological breakpoints in a bivariate relationship, and a piecewise linear

precision using a piecewise linear quantile regression model (PQRM), which is
fitted to the quantiles of the conditional distribution of the response

Recently it was
shown that the quantum Rabi model, which describes a two-level atom coupled to
a single model cavity field, presents quantum phase transitions from a normal
phase to a superradiate phase when the ratio between the frequency of the two
level atom and the frequency of the cavity field extends to infinity. In this
work, we study quantum phase transitions in the quantum Rabi model from the
fidelity susceptibility perspective. We found that the fidelity susceptibility
and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility present universal finite size
scaling behaviors near the quantum critical point of the Rabi model if the
ratio between frequency of the two level atom and frequency of the cavity field
is finite. From the finite size scaling analysis of the fidelity
susceptibility, we found that the adiabatic dimension of the fidelity
susceptibility and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility of fourth order in
the Rabi model are $4/3$ and $2$, respectively. Meanwhile the correlation
length critical exponent and the dynamical critical exponent in the quantum
critical point of the Rabi model are found to be $3/2$ and $1/3$ respectively.
Since the fidelity susceptibility and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility
are the moments of the quantum noise spectrum which is directly measurable by
experiments in linear response regime, the scaling behavior of the fidelity
susceptibility in the Rabi model could be tested experimentally. The simple
structure of the quantum Rabi model paves the way for experimentally observing
the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility at a quantum
phase transition.

surrounding dense gas, although it is still embedded at the center of the core
whose density is $\sim$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The current low-outflow activity and
the very low luminosity indicate that the mass accretion rate onto the
protostar is extremely low in spite of a very early stage of star formation. We
may be witnessing the final stage of the formation of $\sim$0.2 $M_{\odot}$
protostar. However, we cannot explain the observed low luminosity with the
standard pre-main-sequence evolutionary track unless we assume cold accretion
with an extremely small initial radius of the protostar ($\sim$0.65 $R_\odot$).
These facts may challenge our current understanding of the low mass star
formation, in particular the mass accretion process onto the protostar and the
circumstellar disk.

coordination in multi-agent settings without a centralized command center.
However, combining a set of different goals, costs, and constraints to form an
efficient optimization objective for D-RHC can be difficult. To allay this
problem, we use a meta-learning process -- cost adaptation -- which generates
the optimization objective for D-RHC to solve based on a set of human-generated
priors (cost and constraint functions) and an auxiliary heuristic. We use this
adaptive D-RHC method for control of mesh-networked swarm agents. This
formulation allows a wide range of tasks to be encoded and can account for
network delays, heterogeneous capabilities, and increasingly large swarms
through the adaptation mechanism. We leverage the Unity3D game engine to build
a simulator capable of introducing artificial networking failures and delays in
the swarm. Using the simulator we validate our method on an example coordinated

output of a memory module with stochastic addressing as a conditional mixture
distribution, where a read operation corresponds to sampling a discrete memory
address and retrieving the corresponding content from memory. This perspective
allows us to apply variational inference to memory addressing, which enables
effective training of the memory module by using the target information to
guide memory lookups. Stochastic addressing is particularly well-suited for
generative models as it naturally encourages multimodality which is a prominent
aspect of most high-dimensional datasets. Treating the chosen address as a
latent variable also allows us to quantify the amount of information gained
with a memory lookup and measure the contribution of the memory module to the
generative process. To illustrate the advantages of this approach we
incorporate it into a variational autoencoder and apply the resulting model to
the task of generative few-shot learning. The intuition behind this
architecture is that the memory module can pick a relevant template from memory
and the continuous part of the model can concentrate on modeling remaining
variations. We demonstrate empirically that our model is able to identify and
access the relevant memory contents even with hundreds of unseen Omniglot
characters in memory

traffic and poor bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we present a novel
Partition-Centric Processing Methodology (PCPM) to compute PageRank, that
drastically reduces the amount of DRAM communication while achieving high
sustained memory bandwidth. PCPM uses a Partition-centric abstraction coupled
with the Gather-Apply-Scatter (GAS) programming model. By carefully examining
how a PCPM based implementation impacts communication characteristics of the
algorithm, we propose several system optimizations that improve the execution
time substantially. More specifically, we develop (1) a new data layout that
significantly reduces communication and random DRAM accesses, and (2) branch
avoidance mechanisms to get rid of unpredictable data-dependent branches.
  We perform detailed analytical and experimental evaluation of our approach
using 6 large graphs and demonstrate an average 2.7x speedup in execution time
and 1.7x reduction in communication volume, compared to the state-of-the-art.
We also show that unlike other GAS based implementations, PCPM is able to
further reduce main memory traffic by taking advantage of intelligent node
labeling that enhances locality. Although we use PageRank as the target
application in this paper, our approach can be applied to generic SpMV

provides better interpretability than other deep architectures, since the
weights correspond to NMF model parameters, even after training. This
interpretability also provides principled initializations that enable faster
training and convergence to better solutions compared to conventional random
initialization. Second, like many deep networks, DR-NMF is an order of
magnitude faster at test time than NMF, since computation of the network output
only requires evaluating a few layers at each time step. Third, when a limited
amount of training data is available, DR-NMF exhibits stronger generalization
and separation performance compared to sparse NMF and state-of-the-art

the relationship between this rate of growth and the path regularity properties

plasmonic properties through carrier density modulation suggests potential

elucidate fundamental aspects of LSPR modulation through dynamic carrier
density tuning in Sn-doped Indium Oxide NCs. Monodisperse Sn-doped Indium Oxide
NCs with various doping level and sizes were synthesized and assembled in
uniform films. NC films were then charged in an in situ electrochemical cell
and the LSPR modulation spectra were monitored. Based on spectral shifts and
intensity modulation of the LSPR, combined with optical modeling, it was found
that often-neglected semiconductor properties, specifically band structure
modification due to doping and surface states, strongly affect LSPR modulation.
Fermi level pinning by surface defect states creates a surface depletion layer
that alters the LSPR properties; it determines the extent of LSPR frequency
modulation, diminishes the expected near field enhancement, and strongly
reduces sensitivity of the LSPR to the surroundings.

applications to both nonlinear analysis and mathematical economics in [ Gordan

Econom. 3(1) (2010) 1--12 ]. Motivated by Gordan \v{Z}itkovi\'{c}'s idea, in
this paper we introduce the notion of $L^0$--convex compactness for an
$L^0$--convex subset of a topological module over the topological algebra
$L^0(\mathcal{F},K)$, where $L^0(\mathcal{F},K)$ is the algebra of equivalence
classes of random variables from a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$
to the scalar field $K$ of real numbers or complex numbers, endowed with the
topology of convergence in probability. This paper continues to develop the
theory of $L^0$--convex compactness by establishing various kinds of
characterization theorems for $L^0$--convex subsets of a class of important
topological modules--complete random normed modules, in particular, we make use
of the theory of random conjugate spaces to give a characterization theorem of
James type for a closed $L^0$--convex subset of a complete random normed
module. As applications, we successfully generalize some basic theorems of
classical convex optimization and variational inequalities from a convex
function on a reflexive Banach space to an $L^0$--convex function on a random
reflexive random normed module. Since the usual weak compactness method fails
in the random setting of this paper and in particular, since the difficulties
caused by the partial order structure of the range of an $L^0$--valued function
also frequently occurs in the study of problems involved in this paper, we are
forced to discover a series of new skills to meet the needs of this paper.

infinite family is a dining philosopher protocol with any number n of processes

fifteen years that can successfully prove safety in many practical instances.
In this paper, we propose a simple solution to synthesise regular inductive

We provide a termination guarantee when the set of configurations reachable
from a given set of initial configurations is regular. We have tested L*

is due to the fact that standardization is a nonlinear process, which changes
the structure of the original data, causing the correlation coefficient to be

two decades of Prandtl number $Pr$, $0.1 \leq Pr \leq 40$, with the Rayleigh
number $Ra$ fixed at $10^8$. The width-to-height aspect ratio $\Gamma$ spans
between $0.025$ and $0.25$ while the length-to-height aspect ratio is fixed at
one. We first find that for $Pr \geq 0.5$, geometrical confinement can lead to
a significant enhancement in heat transport as characterized by the Nusselt
number $Nu$. For those cases, $Nu$ is maximal at a certain $\Gamma =
\Gamma_{opt}$. It is found that $\Gamma_{opt}$ exhibits a power-law relation
with $Pr$ as $\Gamma_{opt}=0.11Pr^{-0.06}$, and the maximal relative
enhancement generally increases with $Pr$ over the explored parameter range. As
opposed to the situation of $Pr \geq 0.5$, confinement-induced enhancement in
$Nu$ is not realized for smaller values of $Pr$, such as $0.1$ and $0.2$. The
$Pr$ dependence of the heat transport enhancement can be understood in its
relation to the coverage area of the thermal plumes over the thermal boundary
layer (BL) where larger coverage is observed for larger $Pr$ due to a smaller
thermal diffusivity. We further show that $\Gamma_{opt}$ is closely related to
the crossing of thermal and momentum BLs, and find that $Nu$ declines sharply
when the thickness ratio of the thermal and momentum BLs exceeds a certain
value of about one. In addition, through examining the temporally averaged flow
fields and 2D mode decomposition, it is found that for smaller $Pr$ the
large-scale circulation is robust against the geometrical confinement of the
convection cell.

fundamental research interests and potential novel spintronics applications.
Rich examples of topological defects can be found in nanoscale non-uniform spin
textures, such as monopoles, domain walls, vortices, and skyrmions. Recently,
skyrmions stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction have been studied
extensively. However, the stabilization of antiskyrmions is less
straightforward. Here, using numerical simulations we demonstrate that
antiskyrmions can be a stable spin configuration in the presence of anisotropic
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find current-driven antiskyrmion motion
that has a transverse component, namely antiskyrmion Hall effect. The
antiskyrmion gyroconstant is opposite to that for skyrmion, which allows the
current-driven propagation of coupled skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs without
apparent skyrmion Hall effect. The antiskyrmion Hall angle strongly depends on
the current direction, and a zero antiskyrmion Hall angle can be achieved at a
critic current direction. These results open up possibilities to tailor the
spin topology in nanoscale magnetism, which may be useful in the emerging field
of skyrmionics.

into meaningful regions which either represent objects or scene surfaces. The

regularization and trust-region variations of Newton's method as well as of
their linesearch variants. For each method in this class and arbitrary accuracy
threshold $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, we exhibit a smooth objective function with
bounded range, whose gradient is globally Lipschitz continuous and whose
Hessian is $\alpha-$H\""older continuous (for given $\alpha\in [0,1]$), for
which the method in question takes at least
$\lfloor\epsilon^{-(2+\alpha)/(1+\alpha)}\rfloor$ function evaluations to
generate a first iterate whose gradient is smaller than $\epsilon$ in norm.
Moreover, we also construct another function on which Newton's takes
$\lfloor\epsilon^{-2}\rfloor$ evaluations, but whose Hessian is Lipschitz
continuous on the path of iterates. These examples provide lower bounds on the
worst-case evaluation complexity of methods in our class when applied to smooth
problems satisfying the relevant assumptions. Furthermore, for $\alpha=1$, this
lower bound is of the same order in $\epsilon$ as the upper bound on the
worst-case evaluation complexity of the cubic and other methods in a class of
methods proposed in Curtis, Robinson and samadi (2017) or in Royer and Wright

communications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is
required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and
backscattering come from external RF sources, the performance of the hybrid D2D
communications needs to be optimized efficiently. As such, we design two mode
selection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible
adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to
characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors, e.g.,
distribution, spatial density, and transmission load of the ambient

simulations show that the repulsion factor among the ambient transmitters has a
non-trivial impact on the communication performance. Additionally, we reveal
how different mode selection protocols affect the performance metrics.

the formula to all the heavy-light baryons including recently discovered
$\Omega_c$'s and find that these baryons experimentally measured satisfy the
above formula. We predict the average mass values of $B$, $B_s$, $\Lambda_b$,
$\Sigma_c$, $\Xi_c$, and $\Omega_c$ with $L=2$ as 6.01, 6.13, 6.15, 3.05, 3.07,
and 3.34 GeV, respectively. Our results on baryons suggest that these baryons
can be safely regarded as heavy quark-light cluster configuration. We also find
a universal description for all the heavy-light mesons as well as baryons,
i.e., one unique line is enough to describe both of charmed and bottom
heavy-light systems. Our results suggest that instead of mass itself, gluon
flux energy is essential to obtain a linear trajectory.

mismatches in the radio frequency (RF) analog circuits among different antennas
at the base station (BS) break the end-to-end UL and DL channel reciprocity.
Antenna calibration is necessary to avoid the severe performance degradation
with massive MIMO. Many calibration schemes are available to compensate the RF
gain mismatches and restore the channel reciprocity in TDD massive MIMO
systems. In this paper, we focus on the internal self-calibration scheme where
different BS antennas are interconnected via hardware transmission lines.
First, we study the resulting calibration performance for an arbitrary
interconnection strategy. Next, we obtain closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) expressions for each interconnection strategy at the BS with only (M-1)
transmission lines and M denotes the total number of BS antennas. Basing on the
derived results, we further prove that the star interconnection strategy is
optimal for internal self-calibration due to its lowest CRLB. In addition, we
also put forward efficient recursive algorithms to derive the corresponding
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of all the calibration coefficients.
Numerical simulation results are also included to corroborate our theoretical
analyses and results.

that epitaxial YIG ultra-thin films behave as large gap semiconductor, and not

performed on YIG at room temperature. These electrical properties are
responsible for an offset voltage (independent of the in-plane field direction)
whose amplitude, odd in current, grows exponentially with current due to Joule
heating. These electrical properties also induce a sensitivity to the
perpendicular component of the magnetic field through the Hall effect. In our
lateral device, a thermoelectric offset voltage is produced by a temperature
gradient along the wire direction proportional to the perpendicular component
of the magnetic field (Righi-Leduc effects).

transmission capacity and cost in coarse-grained renewable electricity

AGN sample is COMPLETE with respect to radio selection at all z<3.5. Out of 704
AGN, 272 have a counterpart in the Herschel maps. By exploiting the better
statistics of the new sample, we confirm the results of Magliocchetti et al.
(2014): the probability for a radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR
wavelengths is both a function of radio luminosity and redshift, whereby
powerful sources are more likely FIR emitters at earlier epochs. Such an
emission is due to star-forming processes within the host galaxy. FIR emitters
and non-FIR emitters only differentiate in the z<1 universe. At higher
redshifts they are indistinguishable from each other, as there is no difference
between FIR-emitting AGN and star-forming galaxies. Lastly, we focus on radio
AGN which show AGN emission at other wavelengths. We find that MIR emission is
mainly associated with ongoing star-formation and with sources which are
smaller, younger and more radio luminous than the average parent population.
X-ray emitters instead preferentially appear in more massive and older
galaxies. We can therefore envisage an evolutionary track whereby the first
phase of a radio-active AGN and of its host galaxy is associated with MIR
emission, while at later stages the source becomes only active at radio
wavelengths and possibly also in the X-ray.

assume are called levels. In this paper, we consider the variable selection
problem where the set of potential predictors contains both factors and
numerical variables. Formally, this problem is a particular case of the
standard variable selection problem where factors are coded using dummy
variables. As such, the Bayesian solution would be straightforward and,
possibly because of this, the problem, despite its importance, has not received
much attention in the literature. Nevertheless, we show that this perception is
illusory and that in fact several inputs like the assignment of prior
probabilities over the model space or the parameterization adopted for factors
may have a large (and difficult to anticipate) impact on the results. We
provide a solution to these issues that extends the proposals in the standard
variable selection problem and does not depend on how the factors are coded
using dummy variables. Our approach is illustrated with a real example
concerning a childhood obesity study in Spain.

oxides. Apart from LaNiO3, they exhibit on cooling a sharp metal-insulator
electronic phase transition, a concurrent structural phase transition and a
magnetic phase transition toward an unusual antiferromagnetic spin order.
Appealing for various applications, full exploitation of these compounds is
still hampered by the lack of global understanding of the interplay between
their electronic, structural and magnetic properties. Here, we show from
first-principles calculations that the metal-insulator transition of nickelates
arises from the softening of an oxygen breathing distortion, structurally
triggered by oxygen-octahedra rotation motions. The origin of such a rare
triggered mechanism is traced back in their electronic and magnetic properties,
providing a united picture. We further develop a Landau model accounting for
the evolution of the metal-insulator transition in terms of the $R cations and
rationalising how to tune this transition by acting on oxygen rotation motions.

extended to allow a number of fixed blocks with ability to rotate and flexible

is of vital importance in obtaining a good circuit design. Satisfiability
Modulo Theory combines the problem of Boolean satisfiability with domains such
as convex optimization. Satisfiability Modulo Theory provides a richer modeling
language than is possible with pure Boolean SAT formulas. We have conducted our
experiments on MCNC and GSRC benchmark circuits to calculate the total area
occupied, amount of deadspace and the total CPU time consumed while placing the

parametric to a resolution factor and an inter-layer coupling factor. The
former is useful to express layer-specific relevance and the latter quantifies
the strength of node linkage across the layers of a network. However, such
parameters can be set arbitrarily, thus discarding any structure information at
graph or community level. Other issues are related to the inability of properly
modeling order relations over the layers, which is required for dynamic
networks.
  In this paper we propose a new definition of modularity for multilayer
networks that aims to overcome major issues of existing multislice modularity.
We revise the role and semantics of the layer-specific resolution and
inter-layer coupling terms, and define parameter-free unsupervised approaches
for their computation, by using information from the within-layer and
inter-layer structures of the communities. Moreover, our formulation of
multilayer modularity is general enough to account for an available ordering of
the layers and relating constraints on layer coupling. Experimental evaluation
was conducted using three state-of-the-art methods for multilayer community
detection and nine real-world multilayer networks. Results have shown the
significance of our modularity, disclosing the effects of different
combinations of the resolution and inter-layer coupling functions. This work
can pave the way for the development of new optimization methods for
discovering community structures in multilayer networks.

possible to define a new inequality relating the energy, the entropy, and the
partition function of the system. From this inequality, a parameter that
measures the distance between the two states is defined. This distance is
calculated for a general qubit system and for an arbitrary unimodal Gaussian
state. In the qubit case, the dependence on the purity of the system is studied
for $T \geq 0$ and also for $T<0$. In the Gaussian case, the general partition
function given a unimodal quadratic Hamiltonian is calculated and the
comparison of the thermal light state as a thermal equilibrium state of the
parametric amplifier is presented.

and the cosmic opacity in a model-independent way with expansion rate
measurements, $H(z)$, and type Ia supernova (SNe Ia). On the one hand, using a
nonparametric smoothing method Gaussian process, we reconstruct a function
$H(z)$ from opacity-free expansion rate measurements. Then, we integrate the
$H(z)$ to obtain distance modulus $\mu_{\rm H}$, which is dependent on the
cosmic curvature. On the other hand, distances of SNe Ia can be determined by
their photometric observations and thus are opacity-dependent. In our analysis,
by confronting distance moduli $\mu_{\rm H}$ with those obtained from SNe Ia,
we achieve estimations for both the spatial curvature and the cosmic opacity
without any assumptions for the cosmological model. Here, it should be noted
that light curve fitting parameters, accounting for the distance estimation of
SNe Ia, are determined in a global fit together with the cosmic opacity and
spatial curvature to get rid of the dependence of these parameters on
cosmology. In addition, we also investigate whether the inclusion of different
priors for the present expansion rate ($H_0$: global estimation, $67.74\pm
0.46~\rm km~ s^{-1} ~Mpc^{-1}$, and local measurement, $73.24\pm 1.74~\rm km~
s^{-1} ~Mpc^{-1}$) exert influence on the reconstructed $H(z)$ and the
following estimations of the spatial curvature and cosmic opacity. Results show
that, in general, a spatially flat and transparent universe is preferred by the
observations. Moreover, it is suggested that priors for $H_0$ matter a lot.
Finally, we find that there is a strong degeneracy between the curvature and
the opacity.

advantage is given by a decoupling of the cost of optimization from the cost of

addition, a middle-sized surrogate model is produced at no additional cost and
can be used e.g. for error estimation. Numerical examples illustrate the new
framework, showing its effectiveness in producing H2-optimal reduced models at

transmission at millimeter waves. Implementing hybrid beamforming at a
transceiver based on available channel state information is a common solution.
However, many reference methods ignore the complexity of channel estimation for
large antenna arrays or subsequent steps, such as the singular value
decomposition of a channel matrix. To this end, we present a low-complexity
scheme that exploits implicit channel knowledge to facilitate the design of
hybrid beamforming for frequency-selective fading channels. The implicit
channel knowledge can be interpreted as couplings between all possible pairs of
analog beamforming vectors at the transmitter and receiver over the surrounding
channel. Instead of calculating mutual information between large antenna
arrays, we focus on small-size coupling matrices between beam patterns selected
by using appropriate key parameters as performance indicators. This converts
the complicated hybrid beamforming problem to a much simpler one: it amounts to
collecting different sets of the large-power coupling coefficients to construct
multiple alternatives for an effective channel matrix. Then, the set yielding
the largest Frobenius norm (or the largest absolute value of the determinant)
of the effective channel provides the solution to the hybrid beamforming
problem. It turns out that the proposed method does not require information on
MIMO channel and can be simply implemented by the received correlated pilot
signals that are supposed to be used for channel estimation.

U(Ru0.92Rh0.08)2Si2. Our neutron study combined with high-field magnetization,
shows that the magnetic phase above the first metamagnetic transition at Hc1 =
21.6 T has an uncompensated commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with
propagation vector Q2 = ( 2/3 0 0) possessing two single-Q domains. U moments
of 1.45 (9) muB directed along the c axis are arranged in an up-up-down
sequence propagating along the a axis, in agreement with bulk measurements. The
U magnetic form factor at high fields is consistent with both the U3+ and U4+
type. The low field short-range order that emerges from the pure URu2Si2 due to
Rh-doping is initially strengthened by the field but disappears in the
field-induced phase. The tetragonal symmetry is preserved across the transition
but the a axis lattice parameter increases already at low fields. Our results
are in agreement with itinerant electron model with 5f states forming bands
pinned in the vicinity of the Fermi surface that is significantly reconstructed
by the applied magnetic field.

the different genres, were divided into adaptation, development and evaluation
data sets. The Arabic MGB-Challenge comprised two tasks: A) Speech

test set to report progress on the MGB-2 evaluation; B) Arabic dialect
identification, introduced this year in order to distinguish between four major
Arabic dialects - Egyptian, Levantine, North African, Gulf, as well as Modern
Standard Arabic. Two hours of audio per dialect were released for development
and a further two hours were used for evaluation. For dialect identification,
both lexical features and i-vector bottleneck features were shared with
participants in addition to the raw audio recordings. Overall, thirteen teams
submitted ten systems to the challenge. We outline the approaches adopted in

in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) underlay cognitive radio (CR) network.
In particular, a multi-antenna secondary transmitter (SU-Tx) simultaneously
sends secured information and energy to a secondary receiver (SU-Rx) and an
energy receiver (ER), respectively, in the presence of a primary receiver
(PU-Rx). It is assumed that the SU-Rx, ER and PU-Rx are each equipped with a
single antenna. In addition, the SU-Tx should satisfy constraints on maximum
interference leakage to the PU-Rx and minimum harvested energy at the ER. In
this CR network, we consider the transmit covariance matrix design with the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the SU-Tx. In
addition, it is assumed that the ER is a potential passive eavesdropper due to
broadcast nature of wireless transmission. On the other hand, we consider the
worst-case scenario that ER's energy harvesting requirement is only satisfied
when it performs only energy harvesting without intercepting or eavesdropping
information intended for the SU-Rx. We formulate this transmit covariance
matrix design as a SEE maximization problem which is a non-convex problem due
the non-linear fractional objective function. To realize the solution for this
non-convex problem, we utilize the non-linear fractional programming and
difference of concave (DC) functions approaches to reformulate into a tractable
form. Based on these techniques and the Dinkelbach's method, we propose
iterative algorithms to determine the solution for the original SEE
maximization problem. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed transmit covariance matrix design and
convergence of the proposed algorithms.

the stellar density, luminosity function and colour distributions of MW field
stars. We have produced the cluster stellar density radial profile and a
stellar density map from independent approaches, from which we found results in
excellent agreement : the feature extends up to 3.5 times the cluster tidal
radius. Previous works based on shallower photometric data sets have speculated
on the existence of several long tidal tails, similar to that found in Pal 5.
The present outcome shows that NGC 288 could hardly have such tails, but
favours the notion that interactions with the MW tidal field has been a
relatively inefficient process for stripping stars off the cluster. These
results point to the need of a renewed overall study of the external regions of
Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) in order to reliably characterise them.
Hence, it will be possible to investigate whether there is any connection

of a quantum system does not form a Boolean algebra but an orthomodular
lattice. Such lattice can be realised as a lattice of subspaces on a real,
complex or quaternionic Hilbert space, which motivated the formulation of real
and quaternionic quantum mechanics in addition to the usual complex
formulation. It was argued that any real quantum system admits a complex
structure that turns it into a complex quantum system and hence real quantum
mechanics was soon discarded. Several authors however developed a quaternionic
version of quantum mechanics and this version did not seem to be equivalent its
standard formulation on a complex Hilbert space.
  Motivated by some recently developed techniques from quaternionic operator
theory, we conjecture in this article that this not correct and that any
quaternionic quantum system is actually simply the quaternionification of a
complex quantum system. We then show that this conjecture holds true for
quaternionic relativistic elementary systems by applying some recent arguments
that were used to show the equivalence of real and complex elementary
relativistic systems. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the misconception
that complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics are inequivalent arose from
assuming the existence of a left multiplication on the Hilbert space, which is

binomial trade in every iteration of the algorithm. Intuitively, this could
lead to a better convergence rate for reaching the stationary (uniform)
distribution in certain cases. Some experimental evidence for this has been
given in the literature. In this note we give a spectral gap comparison between
two switch-based chains and the Curveball chain. In particular, this comparison
allows us to conclude that the Curveball Markov chain is rapidly mixing
whenever one of the two switch chains is rapidly mixing. Our analysis directly
extends to the case of sampling binary matrices with forbidden entries (under
the assumption of irreducibility). This in particular captures the case of
sampling simple directed graphs with given degrees. As a by-product of our
analysis, we show that the switch Markov chain of the Kannan-Tetali-Vempala
conjecture only has non-negative eigenvalues if the sampled binary matrices
have at least three columns. This shows that the Markov chain does not have to
be made lazy, which is of independent interest. We also obtain an improved

that in this metric description the second order quadrupole effects are not
strong enough to produce narrow observable features in the spectral energy

hence, actually detecting them is unlikely. The full width at tenth-maximum and
full width at half-maximum of the rotation smearing kernels are also reported

transport models for bacterial chemotaxis and shown to represent better the
collective movement observed experimentally. Recently, associated to the
kinetic model, a new instability formalism has been discovered related to stiff
chemotactic response. This motivates our study of traveling wave and
aggregation in population dynamics of chemotactic cells based on the FLKS model
with a population growth term. Our study includes both numerical and
theoretical contributions. In the numerical part, we uncover a variety of
solution types in the one-dimensional FLKS model additionally to standard
Fisher/KPP type traveling wave. The remarkable result is a counter-intuitive
backward traveling wave, where the population density initially saturated in a
stable state transits toward an unstable state in the local population
dynamics. Unexpectedly, we also find that the backward traveling wave solution
transits to a localized spiky solution as increasing the stiffness of
chemotactic response. In the theoretical part, we obtain a novel analytic
formula for the minimum traveling speed which includes the counterbalancing
effect of chemotactic drift vs. reproduction/diffusion in the propagating
front. The front propagation speeds of numerical results only slightly deviate
from the minimum traveling speeds, except for the localized spiky solutions,
even for the backward traveling waves. We also discover an analytic solution of
unimodal traveling wave in the large-stiffness limit, which is certainly
unstable but exists in a certain range of parameters.

that Engstr\""om's definitions (and other quantifiers from the literature) can

capture an adequate notion of team-theoretical generalized quantifier, save for
the special cases in which the quantifiers are applied to flat formulas. We

cascading failures in interdependent networks or systems, in which we model the
dependence between comprising systems using a dependence graph. First, we
propose a new model that captures how the presence of triangles in the
dependence graph alters the manner in which failures transmit from affected
systems to others. Unlike existing models, the new model allows us to
approximate the failure propagation dynamics using a multi-type branching
process, even with triangles. Second, making use of the model, we provide a
simple condition that indicates how increasing clustering will affect the
likelihood that a random failure triggers a cascade of failures, which we call
the probability of cascading failures (PoCF). In particular, our condition
reveals an intriguing observation that the influence of clustering on PoCF
depends on the vulnerability of comprising systems to an increasing number of
failed neighboring systems and the current PoCF, starting with different types
of failed systems. Our numerical studies hint that increasing clustering
impedes cascading failures under both (truncated) power law and Poisson degree
distributions. Furthermore, our finding suggests that, as the degree
distribution becomes more concentrated around the mean degree with smaller
variance, increasing clustering will have greater impact on the PoCF. A
numerical investigation of networks with Poisson and power law degree
distributions reflects this finding and demonstrates that increasing clustering
reduces the PoCF much faster under Poisson degree distributions in comparison
to power law degree distributions.

Earlier work studied cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law,

the corresponding dynamics. In this work, by attaching multiple branches to a
single cycle, we introduce a modified version of this framework which allows us
to consider any weakly connected pursuit graph where each node has an outdegree
of 1. This provides a further generalization of the cyclic pursuit setting.
Then, after showing existence of relative equilibria (rectilinear or circling
motion), pure shape equilibria (spiraling motion) and periodic orbits, we also
derive necessary conditions for stability of a 3-agent collective. By paving a
way for individual agents to join or leave a collective without perturbing the
motion of others, our approach leads to improved reliability of the overall

  Outbreak",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest on record,
resulting in over 25,000 total infections and 15,000 total deaths. Mathematical
modeling can be used to investigate the mechanisms driving transmission during
this outbreak -- in particular, burial practices appear to have been major
source of infections. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a
multi-stage model of Ebola virus transmission linked to a game-theoretic model
of population burial practice selection. We fit our model to cumulative
incidence and mortality data from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from
January 2014 to March, 2016. The inclusion of behavior change substantially
improved best fit estimates and final size prediction compared to a reduced
model with fixed burials. Best fit trajectories suggest that the majority of
sanitary burial adoption occurred between July, 2014 and October, 2014.
However, these simulations also indicated that continued sanitary burial
practices waned following the resolution of the outbreak.
Conclusions/Significance: Surveillance data from the 2014 outbreak appears to
have a signal of changes in the dominant burial practices in all three
countries. Increased adoption of sanitary burials likely attenuated
transmission, but these changes occurred too late to prevent the explosive
growth of the outbreak during its early phase. For future outbreaks, explicitly
modeling behavior change and collecting data on transmission-related behaviors
may improve intervention planning and outbreak response.

significant impact on exciton recombination dynamics and the polarization of

been observed at subarcsecond resolution using ALMA. The aim of this paper is
to investigate the wind properties of the AGB star and to analyse how the known
companion has shaped the CSE. The average mass-loss rate during the creation of
the detected CSE is estimated through modelling, using the ALMA brightness
distribution and previously published single-dish measurements as observational
constraints. The ALMA observations are presented and compared to the results
from a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) binary interaction model with
the same properties as the W Aql system and with two different orbital
eccentricities. Three-dimensional radiative transfer modelling is performed and
the response of the interferometer is modelled and discussed. The estimated
average mass-loss rate of W~Aql agrees with previous results. The size of the
emitting region is consistent with photodissociation models. The CO(J=3-2)
emission is dominated by a smooth component overlayed with two weak arc
patterns with different separations. The larger pattern is predicted by the
binary interaction model with separations of 10"" and therefore likely due to
the known companion. It is consistent with a binary orbit with low
eccentricity. The smaller separation pattern is asymmetric and coincides with
the dust distribution, but the separation timescale (200 yrs) is not consistent
with any known process of the system. The separation of the known companions of
the system is large enough to not have a very strong effect on the
circumstellar morphology. The density contrast across the envelope of a binary
with an even larger separation will not be easily detectable, even with ALMA,
unless the orbit is strongly asymmetric or the AGB star has a much larger
mass-loss rate.

State-the-art sequential estimation methods such as Kalman and particle filters
do not achieve this goal succesfully because both suffer from the collapse of
the parameter posterior distribution. To overcome this intrinsic limitation, we
propose two statistical learning methods. They are based on the combination of
two methodologies: the maximization of the likelihood via
Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithms which are
mainly applied in the statistic and machine learning communities, and the
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The methods are derived using a Bayesian
approach for a hidden Markov model. They are applied to infer deterministic and
stochastic physical parameters from noisy observations in coarse-grained
dynamical models. Numerical experiments are conducted using the Lorenz-96
dynamical system with one and two scales as a proof-of-concept. The imperfect
coarse-grained model is modelled through a one-scale Lorenz-96 system in which
a stochastic parameterization is incorpored to represent the small-scale
dynamics. The algorithms are able to identify an optimal stochastic
parameterization with a good accuracy under moderate observational noise. The
proposed EnKF-EM and EnKF-NR are promising statistical learning methods for
developing stochastic parameterizations in high-dimensional geophysical models.

European Observatory ESO for the southern hemisphere) it is now possible to
make observations with resolutions of the order of milli-arc-seconds,
especially in IR with AMBER instrument (Astronomical Multi Beam Recombine).
These new capabilities allow us to better constrain the stellar structures such
as polar jets, equatorial disks and flattened photospheres of rotating stars.
Thus the estimation of stellar fundamental parameters allows to explore in
detail the mechanisms of mass loss, pulsation and magnetism governing the
variability and the evolution of the stars.
  This thesis presents the results of fast rotating stars observations carried
out on the AMBER spectro-interferometer VLTI in its high \& medium spectral
resolutions modes. The observations were highly degraded by the optical defects
of AMBER and their analysis required the development of specific digital
reduction tools to reach the necessary precision for the interferometric
measurements interpretation. In order to interpret those measures I developed a
chromatic semi-analytical model of rapidly rotating star that allowed me to
estimate, from the differential phases; the degree of flattening, the
equatorial radius, the rotation velocity, the angle of inclination, the
position angle of the star rotation axis in the sky, the local distribution of
the effective temperature and the surface gravity of the star within the von
Zeipel theorem. The results for four massive stars of spectral types B, A and F
have allowed me to characterize the mechanisms discussed above and thus open
some prospect for more systematic studies of similar objects, with extending
later these studies to the relationship photosphere - circumstellar envelope.

source Holmberg IX X--1. By analyzing the data from eight {\it Suzaku} and 13
{\it XMM-Newton} observations conducted between 2001 and 2015, we perform a
detailed spectral modeling for all spectra with simple models and complex
physical models. We find that the spectra can be well explained by a disc plus
thermal Comptonization model. Applying this model, we unveil correlations
between the X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) and the spectral parameters. Among
the correlations, a particular one is the statistically significant positive
correlation between $L_{\rm X}$ and the photon index ($\Gamma$), while at the
high luminosities of $> 2\times10^{40}\,{\rm~erg\ s}^{-1}$, the source becomes
marginally hard and that results a change in the slope of the $\Gamma - L_{\rm
X}$ correlation. Similar variability behavior is observed in the optical depth
of the source around $L_{\rm X} \sim 2\times10^{40}\,{\rm~erg\ s}^{-1}$ as the
source becomes more optically thick. We consider the scenario that a corona
covers the inner part of the disc, and the correlations can be explained as to
be driven by the variability of seed photons from the disc input into the
corona. On the basis of the disc-corona model, we discuss the physical
processes that are possibly indicated by the variability of the spectral
parameters. Our analysis reveals the complex variability behavior of Holmberg
IX X--1 and the variability mechanism is likely related to the geometry of the
X-ray emitting regions.

uninteresting and implausible hypothesis: the sharp null of no effects
whatsoever. We show that this view is overly narrow. Many randomization tests
are also valid under a more general ""bounded"" null hypothesis under which all
effects are weakly negative (or positive), thus accommodating heterogenous
effects. By inverting such tests we can form one-sided confidence intervals for
the maximum (or minimum) effect. These properties hold for all
effect-increasing test statistics, which include both common statistics such as
the mean difference and uncommon ones such as Stephenson rank statistics. The
latter's sensitivity to extreme effects permits detection of positive effects
even when the average effect is negative. We argue that bounded nulls are often
of substantive or theoretical interest, and illustrate with two applications:
testing monotonicity in an IV analysis and inferring effect sizes in a small
randomized experiment.

methods that accurately predict, in an automatic manner, total energy,

Many technologically important material properties directly stem from the
electronic structure of a material, but the usual workhorse for total energies,
namely density-functional theory, is plagued by fundamental shortcomings and
errors from approximate exchange-correlation functionals in its prediction of
the electronic structure. At variance, the $GW$ method is currently the
state-of-the-art {\em ab initio} approach for accurate electronic structure. It
is mostly used to perturbatively correct density-functional theory results, but
is however computationally demanding and also requires expert knowledge to give
accurate results. Accordingly, it is not presently used in high-throughput
screening: fully automatized algorithms for setting up the calculations and
determining convergence are lacking. In this work we develop such a method and,
as a first application, use it to validate the accuracy of $G_0W_0$ using the
PBE starting point, and the Godby-Needs plasmon pole model
($G_0W_0^\textrm{GN}$@PBE), on a set of about 80 solids. The results of the
automatic convergence study utilized provides valuable insights. Indeed, we
find correlations between computational parameters that can be used to further
improve the automatization of $GW$ calculations. Moreover, we find that
$G_0W_0^\textrm{GN}$@PBE shows a correlation between the PBE and the
$G_0W_0^\textrm{GN}$@PBE gaps that is much stronger than that between $GW$ and
experimental gaps. However, the $G_0W_0^\textrm{GN}$@PBE gaps still describe
the experimental gaps more accurately than a linear model based on the PBE
gaps.

of a rigid, asymmetrically charged body to an applied electric field. This
prediction requires calculating the response of the fluid to the Stokes drag
forces on the moving body and on the countercharges near its surface. To
determine the fluid's motion, we represent both the body and the countercharges
using many point sources of drag known as stokeslets. Finding the correct flow
field amounts to finding the set of drag forces on the stokeslets that is
consistent with the relative velocities experienced by each stokeslet. The
method rigorously satisfies the condition that the object moves with no
transfer of momentum to the fluid. We demonstrate that a sphere represented by
1999 well-separated stokeslets on its surface produces flow and drag force like
a solid sphere to one-percent accuracy. We show that a uniformly-charged sphere
with 3998 body and countercharge stokeslets obeys the Smoluchowski prediction
\cite{Morrison} for electrophoretic mobility when the countercharges lie close
to the sphere. Spheres with dipolar and quadrupolar charge distributions rotate
and translate as predicted analytically to four percent accuracy or better. We
describe how the method can treat general asymmetric shapes and charge
distributions. This method offers promise as a way to characterize and
manipulate asymmetrically charged colloid-scale objects from biology (e.g.
viruses) and technology (e.g. self-assembled clusters).

two-beam arrangement, with the scattering field of the auxiliary (""tilted"")

that the spin noise signal detected in the two-beam arrangement is highly

spatial correlations of spin polarization in volume media. Our quantitative
estimates show that, under real experimental conditions, spin diffusion may
strongly suppress the spin-noise signal in the two-beam geometry. Mechanism of
this suppression is similar to that of the time-of-flight broadening with the
critical distance determined by the period of spatial interference of the two

  Urban Areas",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object classification is one of the many holy grails in computer vision and
as such has resulted in a very large number of algorithms being proposed
already. Specifically in recent years there has been considerable progress in
this area primarily due to the increased efficiency and accessibility of deep
learning techniques. In fact, for single-label object classification [i.e. only
one object present in the image] the state-of-the-art techniques employ deep
neural networks and are reporting very close to human-like performance. There
are specialized applications in which single-label object-level classification
will not suffice; for example in cases where the image contains multiple
intertwined objects of different labels.
  In this paper, we address the complex problem of multi-label pixelwise
classification. We present our distinct solution based on a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for performing multi-label pixelwise classification and
its application to large-scale urban reconstruction. A supervised learning
approach is followed for training a 13-layer CNN using both LiDAR and satellite
images. An empirical study has been conducted to determine the hyperparameters
which result in the optimal performance of the CNN. Scale invariance is
introduced by training the network on five different scales of the input and
labeled data. This results in six pixelwise classifications for each different
scale. An SVM is then trained to map the six pixelwise classifications into a
single-label. Lastly, we refine boundary pixel labels using graph-cuts for
maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation with Markov Random Field (MRF) priors.
The resulting pixelwise classification is then used to accurately extract and
reconstruct the buildings in large-scale urban areas. The proposed approach has
been extensively tested and the results are reported.

dynamical evolution of inhomogeneous polymer systems. Here, we present a
systematic evaluation of a set of diffusive DDF theories by comparing their
predictions with data from particle-based Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations
for two selected problems: Interface broadening in compressible A/B homopolymer
blends after a sudden change of the incompatibility parameter, and microphase
separation in compressible A:B diblock copolymer melts. Specifically, we
examine (i) a local dynamics model, where monomers are taken to move
independently from each other, (ii) a nonlocal ""chain dynamics"" model, where
monomers move jointly with correlation matrix given by the local chain
correlator, and (iii,iv) two popular approximations to (ii), namely (iii) the
Debye dynamics model, where the chain correlator is approximated by its value
in a homogeneous system, and (iv) the computationally efficient ""external
potential dynamics"" (EPD) model. With the exception of EPD, the value of the
compressibility parameter has little influence on the results. In the interface
broadening problem, the chain dynamics model reproduces the BD data best.
However, the closely related EPD model produces large spurious artefacts. These
artefacts disappear when the blend system becomes incompressible. In the
microphase separation problem, the predictions of the nonlocal models (ii-iv)
agree with each other and significantly overestimate the ordering time, whereas
the local model (i) underestimates it. We attribute this to the multiscale
character of the ordering process, which involves both local and global chain
rearrangements. To account for this, we propose a mixed local/nonlocal DDF
scheme which quantitatively reproduces all BD simulation data considered here.

a line segment, emulating, in the last case, the SMOTE mechanism. The

multiple super-Jupiter gas giant planets. Within the current observational
limits, however, no such massive planets have been detected. Here we propose a
less stringent `lone-planet' scenario to account for the observed structure
with a single eccentric gas giant and suggest that clearing of these wide gaps
is induced by its sweeping secular resonance. During the depletion of the disk
gas, the planet's secular resonance propagates inward and clears a wide gap
over an extended region of the disk. Although some residual intermediate-size
planetesimals may remain in the gap, their surface density is too low to either
produce super-Earths or lead to sufficiently frequent disruptive collisions to
generate any observable dusty signatures. The main advantage of this
lone-planet sweeping-secular-resonance model over the previous multiple gas
giant tidal truncation scenario is the relaxed requirement on the number of gas
giants. The observationally inferred upper mass limit can also be satisfied
provided the hypothetical planet has a significant eccentricity. A significant
fraction of solar or more massive stars bear gas giant planets with significant
eccentricities. If these planets acquired their present-day kinematic
properties prior to the depletion of their natal disks, their sweeping secular
resonance would effectively impede the retention of neighboring planets and
planetesimals over a wide range of orbital semi-major axes.

Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote
sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data
modalities. However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to
the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e. at test time, as well as in
training. If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art
approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information
from these modalities. This represents a waste of potentially useful
information. We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all
available training modalities in a so-called hallucination network. The network
will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling
fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing. We
demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital
surface model (DSM) images. We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM
images are missing during testing. Our method outperforms both standard CNNs
trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs. We
further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only
some DSM images are missing during testing. Overall, we show that we can
clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during

dependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean molecular weight. We find
that the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation with
planetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud
condensation with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline
slope. However, the observed sample is also intrinsically degenerate in the
sense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary mass. We compile
the distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this
distribution is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that
the distribution of equilibrium temperatures for the observed planets is
similarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption values are affected by
observational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient sample

The Evershed effect, a nearly horizontal outflow of material seen in
the penumbrae of sunspots in the photospheric layers, is a common
characteristic of well-developed penumbrae, but is still not well understood.
Even less is known about photospheric horizontal inflows in the penumbra, also
known as counter Evershed flows. Aims. Here we present a rare feature observed
in the penumbra of the main sunspot of AR NOAA 10930. This spot displays the
normal Evershed outflow in most of the penumbra, but harbors a fast
photospheric inflow of material over a large sector of the disk-center
penumbra. We investigate the driving forces of both, the normal and the counter
Evershed flows. Methods. We invert the spectropolarimetric data from Hinode
SOT/SP using the spatially coupled version of the SPINOR inversion code, which
allows us to derive height-dependent maps of the relevant physical parameters
in the sunspot. These maps show considerable fine structure. Similarities and
differences between the normal Evershed outflow and the counter Evershed flow
are investigated. Results. In both the normal and the counter Evershed flows,
the material flows from regions with field strengths of the order of 1.5-2 kG
to regions with stronger fields. The sources and sinks of both penumbral flows
display opposite field polarities, with the sinks (tails of filaments)
harboring local enhancements in temperature, which are nonetheless colder than
their sources (heads of filaments). Conclusions. The anti-correlation of the
gradients in the temperature and magnetic pressure between the endpoints of the
filaments from the two distinct penumbral regions is compatible with both the
convective driver and the siphon flow scenarios. A geometrical scale of the
parameters is necessary to determine which is the dominant force driving the
flows.

separate the sample into `radio loud' and `radio quiet' subsets based upon
their distribution in the radio -- X-ray plane, and investigate the
distribution of radio spectral indices within each subset. The distribution of
spectral indices of the `radio loud' subset is well described by a Gaussian
distribution with mean spectral index $\alpha = +0.2$ and standard deviation
$0.2$ (here spectral index is defined such that a positive spectral index means
more flux at higher frequencies). The sparser sample for the `radio quiet'

and standard deviation $0.3$; alternatively the simple mean of the distribution
of the radio quiet subset is $-0.3$. The two spectral index distributions are
different at high statistical significance. Confirming previous work in the

from different distributions of jet viewing angles, but find no evidence for
this. We conclude therefore that the jets in the two groups are physically
different in some way, and briefly discuss possible origins and further
possible diagnostics. Finally we note that extrapolating to lower frequencies
the two subsets move closer together in the radio -- X-ray plane, and
approximately merge into a single distribution at around 400 MHz.

development of sophisticated theoretical models, methods, and codes. The
present paper reviews the state-of-the-art in these fields. Computation of
rovibrational states on a given potential energy surface (PES) has now become
standard for triatomic molecules, at least up to intermediate energies, due to
developments achieved by the present authors and others. However, highly
accurate Born--Oppenheimer energies leading to highly accurate PESs are not
accessible even for this two-electron system using conventional electronic
structure procedures e.g., configuration-interaction or coupled-cluster
techniques with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit). For this
purpose highly specialized techniques must be used, e.g., those employing
explicitly correlated Gaussians and nonlinear parameter optimizations. It has
also become evident that a very dense grid of \ai\ points is required to obtain
reliable representations of the computed points extending from the minimum to
the asymptotic limits. Furthermore, adiabatic, relativistic, and QED correction
terms need to be considered to achieve near-spectroscopic accuracy during
calculation of the rotation-vibration spectrum of H3+. The remaining and most
intractable problem is then the treatment of the effects of non-adiabatic
coupling on the rovibrational energies, which, in the worst cases, may lead to
corrections on the order of several \cm. A promising way of handling this
difficulty is the further development of effective, motion- or even
coordinate-dependent, masses and mass surfaces. Finally, the unresolved
challenge of how to describe and elucidate the experimental pre-dissociation
spectra of H$_3^+$ and its isotopologues is discussed.

the concepts of electromagnetic (EM) field, force, energy, and momentum, which
are intimately tied together by Poynting's theorem and by the Lorentz force
law. Whereas Maxwell's equations relate the fields to their material sources,
Poynting's theorem governs the flow of EM energy and its exchange between
fields and material media, while the Lorentz law regulates the back-and-forth
transfer of momentum between the media and the fields. An alternative force
law, first proposed by Einstein and Laub, exists that is consistent with
Maxwell's equations and complies with the conservation laws as well as with the
requirements of special relativity. While the Lorentz law requires the
introduction of hidden energy and hidden momentum in situations where an
electric field acts on a magnetized medium, the Einstein-Laub (E-L) formulation
of EM force and torque does not invoke hidden entities under such
circumstances. Moreover, total force/torque exerted by EM fields on any given
object turns out to be independent of whether the density of force/torque is
evaluated using the law of Lorentz or that of Einstein and Laub. Hidden
entities aside, the two formulations differ only in their predicted force and
torque distributions inside matter. Such differences in distribution are
occasionally measurable, and could serve as a guide in deciding which
formulation, if either, corresponds to physical reality.

iron detector. ICAL is designed to reconstruct muon momentum using magnetic
spectrometers. Energy measurement using magnets fail for muons in TeV range,
since the angular deflection of the muon in the magnetic field is negligible
and the muon tracks become nearly straight. A new technique for measuring the
energy of muons in the TeV range is used by the CCFR neutrino detector, known
as the Pair-Meter technique. This technique estimates muon energy from
measurements of the energy deposited by the muon in many layers of an
iron-calorimeter through e$^+$ and e$^-$ pair production. In this work we have
performed Geant4 based preliminary analysis for iron plates and have
demonstrated the observational feasibility of very high energy muons
(1TeV-1000TeV) in a large mass underground detector operating as a pair-meter.
This wide range of energy spectrum will be helpful for studying the cosmic rays
in the Knee region and an understanding of the atmospheric neutrino flux for
the present and future ultra high-energy atmospheric neutrino experiments.

neutron stars. The conversion of a parallax measurement into a distance, or
distance probability distribution, has led to a debate quite similar to the one
involving Cepheids, centering on the question whether priors can be used when
discussing a single system. With the example of PSRJ0218+4232 we show that a
prior is necessary to determine the probability distribution for the distance.
The distance of this pulsar implies a gamma-ray luminosity larger than 10% of
its spindown luminosity. For velocities the debate is whether a single
Maxwellian describes the distribution for young pulsars. By limiting our
discussion to accurate (VLBI) measurements we argue that a description with two
Maxwellians, with distribution parameters sigma1=77 and sigma2=320 km/s, is
significantly better. Corrections for galactic rotation, to derive velocities
with respect to the local standards of rest, are insignificant.

Rydberg state via two-photon resonance. The polarizations of the probe,
reference and coupling beams are suitably chosen such that only the probe beam
goes through a non-linear phase shift due to two-photon process which is
measured relative to the phase shift of the reference beam using optical

suitable model of two-photon excitation of a 3-level atom to show that the
minimum phase shift measured in our experiment corresponds to Rydberg
population of the order of $10^{-5}$. The corresponding probe absorption for
the given laser parameters is of the order of $10^{-7}$. We demonstrate that
this technique is insensitive to polarization impurity or fluctuations in the

two-photon excitation in thermal vapour where multi channel plates (MCP) could
be relatively difficult to impliment. It can also be used in ultra-cold atomic

particles (Janus particles) fueled by an AC electric field. Both the speed and
the direction of the self-propulsion and the strength of attractive interaction
between the particles can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the applied
electric field and the ion concentration of the solution. The strong attractive
force at high ion concentration give rise to chain formation of the Janus
particles, which can be explained by the quadrupolar charge distribution on the
particles. The chain formation is observed irrespective of the direction of the
self-propulsion of the particles. When both the positions and the orientations
of the heads of chains are fixed, they exhibit beating behavior reminiscent of
eukaryotic flagella. The beating frequency of the chains of the Janus particles
depends on the applied voltage and thus on the self-propulsive force. The
scaling relation between the beating frequency and the self-propulsive force
deviates from theoretical predictions made previously on active filaments.
However, this discrepancy is resolved by assuming that the attractive
interaction between the particles is mediated by the quadrupolar distribution
of the induced charges, which gives indirect but convincing evidence on the
mechanisms of the Janus particles. This signifies that the dependence between
the propulsion mechanism and the interaction mechanism, which had been
dismissed previously, can modify dispersion relations of beating behaviors. In
addition, hydrodynamic interaction within the chain and its effect on
propulsion speed are discussed. These provide new insights on active filaments
such as optimal flagellar design for biological functions.

electrical representation of the synaptic coupling between those is more
challenging. Since this coupling strength depends on the learning procedure in

candidates for replacing synapses in neuromorphic circuits. Due to a huge
number of synapses in a complex neuromorphic circuit, pre-investigations based
on simulations of such systems can be very inefficient and time-consuming.
Flexible and real-time capable memristive emulators, which can directly be
incorporated into real circuits, can overcome this problem. In our approach, we
introduce a generic memristive emulator based on wave digital principles. The
proposed emulator is flexible, robust, efficient, and it preserves the

pick-up and drop-off of user groups can offer several advantages, like fewer
stops and less total travelled mileage. Moreover, it offers the possibility to
select only feasible and well-defined locations where a safe (de-)boarding is
possible. This paper presents a three-step workflow for solving the SDRT
problem with meeting points (SDRT-MP). Firstly, the customers are clustered
into similar groups, then meeting (and divergence) points are determined for
each cluster. Finally, a parallel neighbourhood search algorithm is applied to
create the vehicle routes. Further, a simulation with realistic pick-up and
drop-off locations based on map data is performed in order to demonstrate the
impact of using meeting points for SDRT systems in contrast to the door-to-door
service. Although the average passenger travel time is higher due to enhanced
walking and waiting times, the experiment highlights a reduction of operator
resources required to serve all customers.

  interurban rides","22 pages. Submitted to Journal of Location Based Services",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Drivers offering spare seats in their vehicles on long-distance (interurban)
trips often have to pick up or drop off passengers in cities en route. In that
case it is necessary to agree on a meeting point. Often, this is done by
proposing well-known locations like train stations, which frequently induces
unnecessary detours through the inner-city districts. In contrast, meeting
points in the vicinity of motorways and arterial roads with good public
transport connection can reduce driving time and mileage. This work proposes a
location-based approach to enable a fast and automatic recommendation of
suitable pick-up (and drop-off) points for drivers and passengers using a GIS
workflow and comprehensive precomputation of travel times.

geometry which is a crucial tool for multiple areas of physics, notably general

differential equations. As all the concepts are presented as pictures, there
are no equations in this article. As such this article may be read by
pre-university students who enjoy physics, mathematics and geometry. However it
will also greatly aid the intuition of an undergraduate and masters students,
learning general relativity and similar courses. It concentrates on the tools
needed to understand Maxwell's equations thus leading to the goal of presenting
Maxwell's equations as 3 pictures.

(2D) platforms for studies of nanophotonics, polaritonics, valleytronics and
spintronics, and have the potential to transform applications in sensing,
imaging and quantum information processing. Amongst these, hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) is unique in that it hosts ultra-bright, room temperature single
photon emitters (SPEs). However, an outstanding challenge is to locate SPEs in
hBN with high precision, a task which requires breaking the optical diffraction
limit. Here, we report the imaging of SPEs in layered hBN with a spatial
resolution of 63 nm using ground state depletion (GSD) nanoscopy. Furthermore,
we show that SPEs in hBN possess nonlinear photophysical properties which can
be used to realize a new variant of GSD that employs a coincident pair of
doughnut-shaped lasers to reduce the laser power that is needed to achieve a
given resolution target. Our findings expand the current understanding of the
photophysics of quantum emitters in layered hBN and demonstrate the potential
for advanced nanophotonic and bio-imaging applications which require
localization of individual emitters with super-resolution accuracy.

drought mechanisms and assist in selection of tolerant varieties in a high
throughput manner. In this context, an accurate 3D model of plant canopy
provides a reliable representation for drought stress characterization in
contrast to using 2D images. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end
pipeline including 3D reconstruction, segmentation and feature extraction,
leveraging deep neural networks at various stages, for drought stress study. To
overcome the high degree of self-similarities and self-occlusions in plant
canopy, prior knowledge of leaf shape based on features from deep siamese
network are used to construct an accurate 3D model using structure from motion
on wheat plants. The drought stress is characterized with a deep network based
feature aggregation. We compare the proposed methodology on several
descriptors, and show that the network outperforms conventional methods.

skyrmions and skyrmion lattices can be stabilized by a spatial modulation of
the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in a thin film of centro-symmetric
ferromagnet. Remarkably, the skyrmion size is determined by the ratio of the
exchange length and the period of the spatial modulation of the anisotropy, at
variance with conventional skyrmions stabilized by dipolar and
Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions (DMIs).
