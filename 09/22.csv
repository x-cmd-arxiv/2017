cyber-physical attacks that affect both the power grid physical infrastructure

assume that an adversary attacks an area by: (i) disconnecting some lines
within that area, and (ii) obstructing the information (e.g., status of the
lines and voltage measurements) from within the area to reach the control
center. We leverage the algebraic properties of the AC power flows to introduce
the efficient EXPOSE Algorithm for detecting line failures and recovering
voltages inside that attacked area after such an attack. The EXPOSE Algorithm
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting line failures using
partial information under the AC power flow model in terms of scalability and
accuracy. The main advantages of the EXPOSE Algorithm are that its running time
is independent of the size of the grid and number of line failures, and that it
provides accurate information recovery under some conditions on the attacked

transformation to change the fermionic Frohlich Hamiltonian into the fermionic
LLP Hamiltonian which describes a many-body system containing host fermions
only. We adapt the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) approach, first proposed

with momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{k}'$ interact with a potential
proportional to $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k}'$. We apply the HF theory, which has
the advantage of not restricting the number of particle-hole pairs, to
repulsive Fermi polarons in one dimension. When the impurity and host fermion
masses are equal our variational ansatz, where HF orbitals are expanded in
terms of free-particle states, produces results in excellent agreement with
McGuire's exact analytical results based on the Bethe ansatz. This work raises
the prospect of using the HF ansatz and its time-dependent generalization as
building blocks for developing all-coupling theories for both equilibrium and

analogue of the strong component and basilica decompositions for bidirected
graphs. A bidirected graph is a graph in which a sign $+$ or $-$ is assigned to
each end of each edge, and therefore is a common generalization of digraphs and
signed graphs. Unlike digraphs, the reachabilities between vertices by directed
trails and paths are not equal in general bidirected graphs. In this paper, we
set up an analogue of the strong connectivity theory for bidirected graphs
regarding directed trails, motivated by factor theory. We define the new
concepts of {\em circular connectivity} and {\em circular components} as
generalizations of the strong connectivity and strong components. In our main
theorem, we characterize the inner structure of each circular component; we
define a certain binary relation between vertices in terms of the circular
connectivity and prove that this relation is an equivalence relation. The
nontrivial aspect of this structure arises from directed trails starting and
ending with the same sign, and is therefore characteristic to bidirected graphs
that are not digraphs. This structure can be considered as an analogue of the
general Kotzig-Lov\'asz decomposition, a known canonical decomposition in
$1$-factor theory. From our main theorem, we also obtain a new result in
$b$-factor theory, namely, a $b$-factor analogue of the general Kotzig-Lov\'asz

first octant. By contrast, in the presence of supersymmetry, the
renormalisation group corrections are relatively small, and the prediction of a
near maximal atmospheric mixing angle is maintained, for the studied cases.

process of accretion onto high magnetic field neutron stars: accretion stream
structure and formation, shape of pulse profile and its changes with accretion
torque. Various recent studies of reprocessing of X-rays in the accretion disk
surface, vertical structures of the accretion disk and wind of companion star

provide excellent handle to make accurate measurement of the orbital parameters

a fraction of a million years to tens of millions of years. The orbital period
evolution of X-ray binaries have shown them to be rather complex systems.
Orbital evolution of X-ray binaries can also be carried out from timing of the
X-ray eclipses and there have been some surprising results in that direction,
including orbital period glitches in two X-ray binaries and possible detection
of the most massive circum-binary planet around a Low Mass X-ray Binary.

class of open quantum systems. Studying convergence properties of such a
semigroup, and determining concentration properties of its invariant state,
have been the focus of much research. Quantum versions of functional
inequalities (like the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\'{e}
inequalities) and the so-called transportation cost inequalities, have proved
to be essential for this purpose. Classical functional and transportation cost
inequalities are seen to arise from a single geometric inequality, called the
Ricci lower bound, via an inequality which interpolates between them. The
latter is called the HWI-inequality, where the letters I, W and H are,
respectively, acronyms for the Fisher information (arising in the modified
logarithmic Sobolev inequality), the so-called Wasserstein distance (arising in
the transportation cost inequality) and the relative entropy (or Boltzmann H
function) arising in both. Hence, classically, all the above inequalities and
the implications between them form a remarkable picture which relates elements
from diverse mathematical fields, such as Riemannian geometry, information
theory, optimal transport theory, Markov processes, concentration of measure,
and convexity theory. Here we consider a quantum version of the Ricci lower
bound introduced by Carlen and Maas, and prove that it implies a quantum HWI
inequality from which the quantum functional and transportation cost
inequalities follow. Our results hence establish that the unifying picture of

significant gap between resources needed for a variety of vehicular (in

this gap, different smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches have been proposed that
utilize the external computational/storage resources to enable new

limited due to programability, wireless connectivity, and performance
limitations, along with several security/privacy concerns. In this paper, we
present a novel architecture that can potentially enable rapid development of
various vehicular applications while addressing shortcomings of
smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches. The architecture is formed around a core
component, called SmartCore, a privacy/security-friendly programmable dongle
that brings general-purpose computational and storage resources to the vehicle

develop an application development framework for vehicles, that we call
ProCMotive. ProCMotive enables developers to build customized vehicular

crucial question whether $\Lambda$ is truly a fundamental constant or a mildly
evolving dynamical variable. After many theoretical attempts to understand the
meaning of $\Lambda$, and in view of the enhanced accuracy of the cosmological
observations, it seems now mandatory that this issue should be first settled
empirically before further theoretical speculations on its ultimate nature. In
this work, we summarize the situation of some of these studies. Devoted
analyses made recently show that the $\Lambda=$const. hypothesis, despite being
the simplest, may well not be the most favored one. The overall fit to the
cosmological observables $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ singles out the class RVM of
the ""running"" vacuum models, in which $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$ is an affine
power-law function of the Hubble rate. It turns out that the performance of the
RVM as compared to the ""concordance"" $\Lambda$CDM model (with $\Lambda=$const.)
is much better. The evidence in support of the RVM may reach $\sim 4\sigma$
c.l., and is bolstered with Akaike and Bayesian criteria providing strong
evidence in favor of the RVM option. We also address the implications of this
framework on the tension between the CMB and local measurements of the current

two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, adopting the $\alpha$-viscosity

rotationally supported disk within the Bondi radius ($R_{\rm B}$), we find a
global steady accretion solution. The solution consists of a rotational
equilibrium distribution at $r\sim R_{\rm B}$, where the density follows $\rho
\propto (1+R_{\rm B}/r)^{3/2}$, surrounding a geometrically thick and optically
thin accretion disk at the centrifugal radius, where thermal energy generated
by viscosity is transported via strong convection. Physical properties of the
inner solution agree with those expected in convection-dominated accretion
flows (CDAF; $\rho \propto r^{-1/2}$). In the inner CDAF solution, the gas
inflow rate decreases towards the center due to convection ($\dot{M}\propto
r$), and the net accretion rate (including both inflows and outflows) is
strongly suppressed by several orders of magnitude from the Bondi accretion
rate $\dot{M}_{\rm B}$ The net accretion rate depends on the viscous strength,
following $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm B}\propto (\alpha/0.01)^{0.6}$. This solution
holds for low accretion rates of $\dot{M}_{\rm B}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}< 10^{-3}$
having minimal radiation cooling, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington
rate. In a hot plasma at the bottom ($r<10^{-3}~R_{\rm B}$), thermal conduction
would dominate the convective energy flux. Since suppression of the accretion
by convection ceases, the final BH feeding rate is found to be
$\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm B} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. This rate is as low as
$\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ inferred for SgrA$^*$ and the

is largely a singlet, and the $\eta$ meson an octet. In contrast, states with
$J^P = 1^-$ are flavor diagonal: \textit{e.g.}, the $\phi(1020)$ is almost pure
$\bar{s} s$. Using effective Lagrangians, we show how this generalizes to
states with higher spin, assuming that they can be classified according to the
unbroken chiral symmetry of $G_{\mathrm{fl}} = SU(3)_{\mathrm{L}} \times
SU(3)_{\mathrm{R}}$. We construct effective Lagrangians from terms invariant
under $G_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and introduce the concept of \textit{hetero-} and
\textit{homo}chiral multiplets. Because of the axial anomaly, only terms
invariant under the $Z(3)_{\mathrm{A}}$ subgroup of the axial

including the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime(958)$, there are $Z(3)_{\mathrm{A}}$
invariant terms with low mass dimension which cause states to mix according to
$SU(3)_{\mathrm{V}}$ flavor. For homochiral multiplets, which begin with that
including the $\phi(1020)$, there are no $Z(3)_{\mathrm{A}}$ invariant terms
with low mass dimension, and so states are diagonal in flavor. In this way we
predict the flavor mixing for the heterochiral multiplet with spin one, as well
as for hetero- and homochiral multiplets with spin two and spin three.

conducted a systematic study of remnants of major mergers which progenitors
have been selected (1) to follow the gas richness-look back time relationship,
and (2) with a representative distribution of orbits and spins in a
cosmological frame. Analyzing the surface-mass density profile of both nearby
galaxies and merger remnants with two components, we find that most of them
show pseudo-bulges or bar dominated centers. Even if some orbits lead to
classical bulges just after the fusion, the contamination by the additional gas
that gradually accumulates to the center and forming stars later on, leads to
remnants apparently dominated by pseudo-bulges. We also found that simple SPH
simulations should be sufficient to form realistic spiral galaxies as remnants
of ancient gas-rich mergers without need for specifically tuned feedback
conditions. We then conclude that pseudo-bulges and bars in spiral galaxies are
natural consequences of major mergers when they are realized in a cosmological

scattering properties based on results previously inferred from Kepler-7b
optical phase curves, including inhomogeneous aerosols centered along the
western terminator and hypothetical cases in which aerosols additionally
extended across much of the planet's night side. In all cases, a strong jet
capable of advecting aerosols from a cooler nightside to dayside was found to
persist, but only at the equator. Colder temperatures at mid- and
polar-latitudes might permit aerosol to form on the dayside without the need
for advection. By altering the deposition and redistribution of heat, aerosols
along the western terminator produced an asymmetric heating that effectively
shifts the hottest spot further east of the sub-stellar point than expected for
a uniform distribution. The addition of opaque high clouds on the nightside can
partly mitigate this enhanced shift by retaining heat that contributes to
warming west of the hotspot. These expected differences in infrared phase
curves could place constraints on proposed cloud distributions and their
infrared opacities for brighter hot Jupiters.

the transition mass ~ 10^11 Msun and a steeper low-mass slope than the data,
suggesting that feedback is too weak in low-mass halos and conversely too
strong near the transition mass. Using literature prescriptions to include hot
halo gas and potential unobservable galaxy gas produces a group BMF with slope
similar to the HMF even below the transition mass. Its normalization is lower
by a factor of ~2, in agreement with estimates of warm-hot gas making up the

mass calculated two ways, via halo abundance matching (HAM) and via dynamics

find that baryonic collapse efficiencies reach a flat maximum for groups across
the halo mass range of M_halo ~ 10^11.4-12 Msun, which we label ""nascent

Despite the strong interest in the model, there is a lack of studies on
possible cosmological implications and effects on cosmological parameters
inference. We investigate correlations with the other standard cosmological
parameters using cosmic microwave background observations, finding significant
degeneracies, especially with the tilt of the primordial power spectrum and the
sound horizon at radiation drag. However, these degeneracies can be greatly
reduced with the inclusion of small scale polarization data. We also explore if
PBHs as dark matter in simple extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model induces extra degeneracies, especially between the
additional parameters and the PBH's ones. Finally, we present cosmic microwave
background constraints on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, not only for
monochromatic PBH mass distributions but also for popular extended mass
distributions. Our results show that extended mass distribution's constraints
are tighter, but also that a considerable amount of constraining power comes
from the high-$\ell$ polarization data. Moreover, we constrain the shape of
such mass distributions in terms of the correspondent constraints on the PBH
mass fraction.

lectures on orthogonal systems. These results provide local existence and
uniqueness of solutions to certain types of first order PDE systems where each
equation contains a single derivative for which it is solved: \[\frac{\partial
u_i}{\partial x_j}(x)=f_{ij}(x,u(x)).\] The data prescribe values for the
unknowns $u_i$ along certain hyperplanes through a given point $\bar x$.
  The first theorem applies to determined systems (the number of equations
equals the number unknowns), and a unique, local solution is obtained via
Picard iteration. While Darboux's statement of the theorem leaves unspecified
""certaines conditions de continuit\'e,"" it is clear from his proof that he
assumes Lipschitz continuity of the maps $f_{ij}$. On the other hand, he did
not address the regularity of the data. We provide a precise formulation and
proof of his first theorem.
  The second theorem is more involved and applies to overdetermined systems of
the same general form. Under the appropriate integrability conditions, Darboux
used his first theorem to treat the cases with two and three independent
variables. We provide a proof for any number of independent variables.
  While the systems are rather special, they do appear in applications; e.g.,
the second theorem contains the classical Frobenius theorem on overdetermined
systems as a special case. The key aspect of the proofs is that they apply to
non-analytic situations. In an analytic setup the results are covered by the
general Cartan-K\""ahler theorem.

Two Colour Instrument on the Danish 1.54m telescope. For each detected

two passbands, and measure the relative position of the companion. The
probability of each companion being physically associated was determined using
our two-colour photometry. A catalogue of close companion stars is presented,

temperature. For companions that are potential binary companions, we review
archival and catalogue data for further evidence. For WASP-77AB and WASP-85AB,
we combine our data with historical measurements to determine the binary

numerically till its quasilinear quenching and beyond, using an in-house
developed electrostatic 1D particle-in-cell simulation code. For different
initial drift velocities $k_{L}v_{0}/\omega_{pe} \approx 0.1 \, - \, 1$ and for
a wide range of electron to ion mass ratios (m/M), growth rate obtained from
simulation agrees well with the numerical solution of the fourth order
dispersion relation. Quasi-linear saturation of Buneman instability occurs when
ratio of electrostatic field energy density ($\sum\limits_{k}
|E_{k}|^{2}/8{\pi}$) to initial electron drift kinetic energy density ($W_{0} =
\frac{1}{2} n_{0}m v^{2}_{0}$) reaches up to a constant value, which as
predicted by Hirose [Plasma Physics 20, 481(1978)], is independent of initial
electron drift velocity but depends on electron to ion mass ratio m/M as
$\sum\limits_{k} |E_{k}|^{2}/16{\pi}W_{0} \approx (m/M)^{1/3}$. This result
stands verified in our simulations. Growth of the instability beyond the first
saturation (quasilinear saturation ) till its final saturation [Ishihara et.
al., PRL 44, 1404(1980)] follows an algebraic scaling with time. In contrast to
the quasilinear saturation, the ratio of final saturated electrostatic field
energy density to initial kinetic energy density, is relatively independent of
electron to ion mass ratio and is found to depend only on the initial drift
velocity. Beyond the final saturation, electron phase space holes coupled to
large amplitude ion solitary waves, a state known as coupled hole-soliton , are
seen in our simulations. The propagation characteristics ( amplitude - speed
relation ) of these coherent modes is found to be consistent with the theory of

its fingerprints on the primordial perturbation spectrum and non-Gaussianity,

particularly nice subclass of involutive partial frames, called rich, can be
completely analyzed. Involutive, but non-rich case is somewhat harder to
handle. We provide a complete answer in the case of $m=3$ and arbitrary $n$, as
well as some general results for arbitrary $m$. The non-involutive case is far
more challenging, and we only obtain a comprehensive analysis in the case
$n=3$, $m=2$. Finally, we provide explicit examples illustrating the various
possibilities. Our initial motivation for considering this problem comes from
the geometric study of hyperbolic conservative systems in one spatial
dimension.

reliability for high processing temperatures. In this work, we study the
Gilbert damping constant ({\alpha}) of perpendicularly magnetized W/CoFeB/MgO

stability. The {\alpha} of these PMA films annealed at different temperatures
is determined via an all-optical Time-Resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect

increasing annealing temperature, reaches a minimum of {\alpha} = 0.016 at an
annealing temperature of 350 {\deg}C, and then increases to 0.024 after
post-annealing at 400 {\deg}C. The minimum {\alpha} observed at 350 {\deg}C is
rationalized by two competing effects as the annealing temperature becomes
higher: the enhanced crystallization of CoFeB and dead-layer growth occurring
at the two interfaces of the CoFeB layer. We further demonstrate that {\alpha}
of the 400 {\deg}C-annealed W/CoFeB/MgO film is comparable to that of a
reference Ta/CoFeB/MgO PMA film annealed at 300 {\deg}C, justifying the
enhanced thermal stability of the W-seeded CoFeB films.

different human annotators, which makes standard word error rate (WER)
inadequate as an evaluation metric. Such a situation is typical for machine
translation (MT), and thus we borrow ideas from an MT evaluation metric, namely
TERp, an extension of translation error rate which is closely-related to WER.
In particular, in the process of comparing a hypothesis to a reference, we make
use of spelling variants for words and phrases, which we mine from Twitter in
an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments with evaluating ASR output for
Egyptian Arabic, and further manual analysis, show that the resulting WERd

a trade-off constraint which quantifies the trade-off between path length and
stop count and provides a lower bound for the bi-objective optimization

that match the lower bound within a constant factor. Importantly, this solution
approach uses transformations of the general CPPG to either a discrete CPPG or

absorption spectra of solvated dyes, as many prominent spectral features can
often be ascribed to vibronic transitions. Vibronic spectra can be computed
within the Franck-Condon approximation for small dyes in solution using an
implicit solvent model. However, implicit solvent models neglect specific
solute-solvent interactions and provide only an approximate treatment of
solvent polarization effects. Furthermore, temperature-dependent solvent
broadening effects are often only accounted for using a broadening parameter
chosen to match experimental spectra. On the other hand, ensemble approaches
provide a straightforward way of accounting for solute-solvent interactions and
temperature-dependent broadening effects by computing vertical excitation
energies obtained from an ensemble of solute-solvent conformations. However,
ensemble approaches do not explicitly account for vibronic effects and often
produce spectral shapes in poor agreement with experiment. We address these
shortcomings by combining the vibronic fine structure of an excitation obtained
in the Franck-Condon picture at zero temperature with vertical excitations
computed for a room-temperature ensemble of solute-solvent configurations. In
this combined approach, all temperature-dependent broadening is therefore
treated classically through the sampling of configurations, with vibronic
contributions included as a zero-temperature correction to each vertical
transition. We test the proposed method on Nile Red and the green fluorescent
protein chromophore in polar and non-polar solvents. For systems with strong
solute-solvent interaction, the approach yields a significant improvement over
the ensemble approach, whereas for systems with weaker interactions, both the
shape and the width of the spectra are in excellent agreement with experiment.

Bayesian semiparametric and nonparametric regression models provide an
attractive avenue in this regard as these allow natural posterior uncertainty
quantification of patient specific treatment decisions as well as the
population wide value of the prediction-based ITR. In addition, via the use of
such models, inference is also available for the value of the Optimal ITR. We
propose such an approach and implement it using Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART) as this model has been shown to perform well in fitting
nonparametric regression functions to continuous and binary responses, even
with many covariates. It is also computationally efficient for use in practice.
With BART we investigate a treatment strategy which utilizes individualized
predictions of patient outcomes from BART models. Posterior distributions of
patient outcomes under each treatment are used to assign the treatment that
maximizes the expected posterior utility. We also describe how to approximate
such a treatment policy with a clinically interpretable ITR, and quantify its
expected outcome. The proposed method performs very well in extensive
simulation studies in comparison with several existing methods. We illustrate
the usage of the proposed method to identify an individualized choice of

the dynamics of populations, and is central to metapopulation theory. At the
same time, local adaptation to environmental conditions creates a geographic
mosaic of evolutionary forces, where the combined drivers of selection and gene
flow interact. Although the dispersal of individuals from donor to recipient
populations provides connections within the metapopulation, promoting
demographic and evolutionary rescue, it may also introduce maladapted
individuals into habitats host to different environmental conditions,
potentially lowering the fitness of the recipient population. Here we explore a
model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics between two populations connected by
dispersal, where the productivity of each is defined by a trait complex that is
subject to local selection. Although general in nature, our model is inspired
by salmon metapopulations, where dispersal between populations is defined in
terms of the straying rate, which has been shown to be density-dependent. The
results of our model reveal that increased straying between evolving
populations leads to alternative stable states, which has large and nonlinear
effects on two measures of metapopulation robustness: the portfolio effect and
the time to recovery following an induced disturbance. We show that
intermediate levels of straying result in large gains in robustness, and that
increased habitat heterogeneity promotes robustness when straying rates are
low, and erodes robustness when straying rates are high. Finally, we show that
density-dependent straying promotes robustness, particularly when the aggregate
biomass is low and straying is correspondingly high, which has important
ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both
natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

atmospheric cloud and haze layers, 2) spatial structure, e.g. cloud bands and
rotational flattening, 3) the spin axis orientation and 4) particle sizes and
cloud top pressure. We introduce a novel high-contrast imaging scheme that
combines angular differential imaging (ADI) and accurate near-infrared
polarimetry to characterize self-luminous giant exoplanets. We implemented this
technique at VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS and developed the corresponding observing
strategies, the polarization calibration and the data-reduction approaches. By
combining ADI and polarimetry we can characterize planets that can be directly
imaged with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. We use the IRDIS pupil-tracking
mode and combine ADI and principal component analysis to reduce speckle noise.
We take advantage of IRDIS' dual-beam polarimetric mode to eliminate
differential effects that severely limit the polarimetric sensitivity
(flat-fielding errors, differential aberrations and seeing), and thus further
suppress speckle noise. To correct for instrumental polarization effects, we
apply a detailed Mueller matrix model that describes the telescope and
instrument and that has an absolute polarimetric accuracy $\leq0.1\%$. Using
this technique we have observed the planets of HR 8799 and the (sub-stellar)
companion PZ Tel B. Unfortunately, we do not detect a polarization signal in a
first analysis. We estimate preliminary $1\sigma$ upper limits on the degree of
linear polarization of $\sim1\%$ and $\sim0.1\%$ for the planets of HR 8799 and
PZ Tel B, respectively. The achieved sub-percent sensitivity and accuracy show
that our technique has great promise for characterizing exoplanets through
direct-imaging polarimetry.

decade. Its advantages include compatibility with general nonlinear system
dynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the availability of
well-developed numerical tools. The main challenge is addressing its
exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of state
variables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachability
theory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools,

regression model, the number of relevant predictors may be small relative to
the information set available from which to build a prediction equation. It is
well known that forecasts based off of (un-penalized) least squares estimates
can overfit the data and lead to poor predictions. Since the Minnesota prior
was proposed (Doan et al. (1984)), there have been many methods developed
aiming at improving prediction performance. In this paper we propose the
horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al. (2010), Carvalho et al. (2009)) in the context
of a Bayesian VAR. The horseshoe prior is a unique shrinkage prior scheme in
that it shrinks irrelevant signals rigorously to 0 while allowing large signals
to remain large and practically unshrunk. In an empirical study, we show that
the horseshoe prior competes favorably with shrinkage schemes commonly used in
Bayesian VAR models as well as with a prior that imposes true sparsity in the
coefficient vector. Additionally, we propose the use of particle Gibbs with
backwards simulation (Lindsten et al. (2012), Andrieu et al. (2010)) for the
estimation of the time-varying volatility parameters. We provide a detailed
description of all MCMC methods used in the supplementary material that is

periodic media that transcends the usual quasi-static approximation, there are
generally two schools of thought: (i) the two-scale approach that is prevalent
in mathematics, and (ii) the Willis' homogenization framework that has been
gaining popularity in engineering and physical sciences. Notwithstanding a
mounting body of literature on the two competing paradigms, a clear
understanding of their relationship is still lacking. In this study we deploy
an effective impedance of the scalar wave equation as a lens for comparison and
establish a low-frequency, long-wavelength (LF-LW) dispersive expansion of the
Willis effective model, including terms up to the second order. Despite the
intuitive expectation that such obtained effective impedance coincides with its
two-scale counterpart, we find that the two descriptions differ by a modulation
factor which is, up to the second order, expressible as a polynomial in
frequency and wavenumber. We track down this inconsistency to the fact that the
two-scale expansion is commonly restricted to the free-wave solutions and thus
fails to account for the body source term which, as it turns out, must also be
homogenized -- by the reciprocal of the featured modulation factor. In the
analysis, we also (i) reformulate for generality the Willis' effective
description in terms of the eigenfunction approach, and (ii) obtain the
corresponding modulation factor for dipole body sources, which may be relevant
to some recent efforts to manipulate waves in metamaterials.

and the most massive star clusters in the universe - potential massive black
hole nurseries - has for decades eluded scrutiny. Spectroscopy of these systems
has been scarce, whereas theoretical arguments suggest that radiation pressure
on dust grains somehow inhibits star formation. Here, we harness an accelerated
Monte Carlo radiation transport scheme to report a radiation hydrodynamical
simulation of super star cluster formation in turbulent clouds. We find that
radiation pressure reduces the global star formation efficiency by 30-35%, and
the star formation rate by 15-50%, both relative to a radiation-free control
run. Overall, radiation pressure does not terminate the gas supply for star
formation and the final stellar mass of the most massive cluster is $\sim
1.3\times10^6\,M_\odot$. The limited impact as compared to in idealized
theoretical models is attributed to a radiation-matter anti-correlation in the
supersonically turbulent, gravitationally collapsing medium. In isolated
regions outside massive clusters, where the gas distribution is less disturbed,
radiation pressure is more effective in limiting star formation. The resulting
stellar density at the cluster core is $\ge
10^{8}\,M_{\odot}\,\textrm{pc}^{-3}$, with stellar velocity dispersion $\gtrsim
70\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$. We conclude that the super star cluster nucleus
is propitious to the formation of very massive stars via dynamical core
collapse and stellar merging. We speculate that the very massive star may avoid
the claimed catastrophic mass loss by continuing to accrete dense gas
condensing from a gravitationally-confined ionized phase.

a flexible and scalable nonparametric regression approach for modern applied
statistics problems. For the practitioner dealing with large and complex
nonlinear response surfaces, its advantages include a matrix-free formulation
and the lack of a requirement to prespecify a confining regression basis.
Although flexible in fitting the mean, BART has been limited by its reliance on
a constant variance error model. This homoscedastic assumption is unrealistic
in many applications. Alleviating this limitation, we propose HBART, a
nonparametric heteroscedastic elaboration of BART. In BART, the mean function
is modeled with a sum of trees, each of which determines an additive
contribution to the mean. In HBART, the variance function is further modeled
with a product of trees, each of which determines a multiplicative contribution
to the variance. Like the mean model, this flexible, multidimensional variance
model is entirely nonparametric with no need for the prespecification of a
confining basis. Moreover, with this enhancement, HBART can provide insights
into the potential relationships of the predictors with both the mean and the
variance. Practical implementations of HBART with revealing new diagnostic
plots are demonstrated with simulated and real data on used car prices, fishing

network for summarizing the history of purchases, continuous vectors
representing items for scalability, and a novel attention-based recurrent

the proposed approach on two publicly available datasets, MovieLens-20M and

improve the performance over various baselines in terms of precision, recall

determined that a diphone synthesis system was the most effective choice for
the scope of this project. A method of automatically identifying and extracting

diphone database by a speaker in less than 40 minutes. CMUdict was used to
determine the pronunciation of known words. A system for smoothing the
transitions between diphone recordings was designed and implemented. CMUdict
was then used to train a maximum-likelihood prediction system to determine the
correct pronunciation of unknown English language alphabetic words. Then, a
Part Of Speech tagger was designed to find the lexical class of words within a
sentence.
  A method of altering the pitch, duration, and volume of the produced voice
over time was designed, being a combination of the TD-PSOLA algorithm and a
novel approach referred to as Unvoiced Speech Duration Shifting. This minimises
distortion of the voice when shifting the pitch or duration, while maximising
computational efficiency by operating in the time domain. This approach was
used to add correct lexical stress to vowels within words. A text tokenisation
system was developed to handle arbitrary text input, allowing pronunciation of
numerical input tokens and use of appropriate pauses for punctuation. Methods
for further improving sentence level speech naturalness were discussed.
Finally, the system was tested with listeners for its intelligibility and
naturalness.

revolutionary for future data storage and spintronics applications. The
existence and stability of skyrmions in magnetic materials is usually
associated to the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in
bulk magnets or in magnetic thin films lacking inversion symmetry. While some
methods have already been proposed to generate isolated skyrmions in thin films
with DMI, a thorough study of the conditions under which the skyrmions will
remain stable in order to be manipulated in an integrated spintronic device are
still an open problem. The stability of such structures is believed to be a
result of ideal combinations of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), DMI
and the interplay between geometry and magnetostatics. In the present work we
show some micromagnetic results supporting previous experimental observations
of magnetic skyrmions in spin-valve stacks with a wide range of DMI values.
Using micromagnetic simulations of cobalt-based disks, we obtain the magnetic
ground state configuration for several values of PMA, DMI and geometric
parameters. Skyrmion numbers, corresponding to the topological charge, are
calculated in all cases and confirm the occurrence of isolated, stable, axially
symmetric skyrmions for several combinations of DMI and anisotropy constant.
The stability of the skyrmions in disks is then investigated under magnetic
field and spin-polarized current, in finite temperature, highlighting the
limits of applicability of these spin textures in spintronic devices.

Exploring the vulnerabilities of existing security tools can prevent
cyber-attacks from taking advantages of the system weaknesses. We propose a
hybrid network security scheme including intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and
honeypots scattered throughout the network. This combines the advantages of two
security technologies. A honeypot is an activity-based network security system,
which could be the logical supplement of the passive detection policies used by
IDSs. This integration forces us to balance security performance versus cost by
scheduling device activities for the proposed system. By formulating the
scheduling problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision

without requiring centralized control. The partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) is a useful choice for controlling stochastic systems. As a
combination of two Markov models, POMDPs combine the strength of hidden Markov
Model (HMM) (capturing dynamics that depend on unobserved states) and that of
Markov decision process (MDP) (taking the decision aspect into account).
Decision making under uncertainty is used in many parts of business and
science.We use here for security tools.We adopt a high-quality approximation
solution for finite-space POMDPs with the average cost criterion, and their
extension to DEC-POMDPs. We show how this tool could be used to design a
network security framework.

segregation of two populations from the perspective of modern dynamical systems
theory. We derive a Schelling dynamical system and carry out a complete
quantitative analysis of the system for the case of a linear tolerance schedule
in both populations. In doing so, we recover and generalise Schelling's
qualitative results. For the case of unlimited population movement, we derive
exact formulae for regions in parameter space where stable integrated
population mixes can occur. We show how neighbourhood tipping can be adequately
explained in terms of basins of attraction. For the case of limiting population
movement, we derive exact criteria for the occurrence of new population mixes
and identify the stable cases. We show how to apply our methodology to
nonlinear tolerance schedules, illustrating our approach with numerical
simulations. We associate each term in our Schelling dynamical system with a
social meaning. In particular we show that the dynamics of one population in
the presence of another can be summarised as follows
  {rate of population change} = {intrinsic popularity of neighbourhood} -
{finite size of neighbourhood} - {presence of other population}
  By approaching the dynamics from this perspective, we have a complementary
approach to that of the tolerance schedule.

who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service
disruptions. In this paper, we study false data injection (FDI) attacks against
railways' traction power systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of
FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor
measurements - which we call efficiency attack and safety attack -- that (i)
maximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local
voltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To
counteract, we develop a global attack detection (GAD) system that serializes a
bad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on
unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection
system can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current
measurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS,
attack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system
features an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative
rates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive
simulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS
setup is vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected
effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false positive rate.

Search (GLS) can improve the efficiency of local search. By changing the guide
function, GLS guides a local search to escape from locally optimal solutions
and find better solutions. The key component of GLS is its penalizing mechanism
which determines which feature is selected to penalize when the search is
trapped in a locally optimal solution. The original GLS penalizing mechanism
only makes use of the cost and the current penalty value of each feature. It is
well known that many combinatorial optimization problems have a big valley
structure, i.e., the better a solution is, the more the chance it is closer to
a globally optimal solution. This paper proposes to use big valley structure
assumption to improve the GLS penalizing mechanism. An improved GLS algorithm
called Elite Biased GLS (EB-GLS) is proposed. EB-GLS records and maintains an
elite solution as an estimate of the globally optimal solutions, and reduces
the chance of penalizing the features in this solution. We have systematically
tested the proposed algorithm on the symmetric traveling salesman problem.
Experimental results show that EB-GLS is significantly better than GLS.

survey-- low ion column densities show 1) little dependence on galaxy specific
star formation rate, 2) a patchy covering fraction indicative of 10^4 K clouds
with a small volume filling factor, and 3) a declining covering fraction as
impact parameter increases from 20-160 kpc. Simulated Si II, Si III, Si IV, C
II, and C III column densities show good agreement with observations, while Mg
II is under-predicted. Low ions trace a significant metal reservoir, ~10^8
Msol, residing primarily at 10-100 kpc from star-forming and passive central
galaxies. These clouds tend to flow inwards and most will accrete onto the
central galaxy within the next several Gyr, while a small fraction are
entrained in strong outflows. A two-phase structure describes the inner CGM

This cool phase is separate from the O VI observed by COS-Halos, which arises
from the outer CGM (>0.5 R_200) tracing virial temperature gas around L*

of observed column densities (e.g. aligned Si II/Si III absorbers) are

lower median household income, or higher fraction of residents who have
Bachelor's and higher degrees, tend to have more hosts. However, when

listings; listings located in areas with higher median household income tend to
have more new reviews. Our findings demonstrate empirically that the
disadvantage of SES-disadvantaged areas and the advantage of SES-advantaged
areas may be present in the sharing economy.

demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be
considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior
evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world
costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research

not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it

trajectory design to maximize the energy transferred to all ERs during a finite

ERs by optimizing the UAV's trajectory subject to its maximum speed constraint.
We obtain its optimal solution, which shows that the UAV should hover at one
single fixed location during the whole period. However, the sum-energy
maximization incurs a ""near-far"" fairness issue. To overcome this issue, we
consider a different problem to maximize the minimum received energy among all

Lagrange dual method. Then, for the general case with the UAV's maximum speed

motivated by the optimal trajectory in the ideal case, and obtain efficient
trajectory designs by applying the successive convex programing (SCP).

the unitaries implementing the dynamics. These are faithful Type~I states. The
critical value $\beta_c$ is the largest real pole of the partition function of
the system and is related to the clique polynomial and skew-growth function of
the monoid, relative to the degree map given by the logarithm of the
multiplicative homomorphism. Motivated by the study of equilibrium states, we
give a proof of the inversion formula for the growth series of a quasi-lattice
ordered monoid in terms of the clique polynomial as in recent work of
Albenque--Nadeau and McMullen for the finitely generated case, and in terms of
the skew-growth series as in recent work of Saito. Specifically, we show that
$e^{-\beta_c}$ is the smallest pole of the growth series and thus is the
smallest positive real root of the clique polynomial. We use this to show that
equilibrium states in the subcritical range can only occur at inverse
temperatures that correspond to roots of the clique polynomial in the interval
$(e^{-\beta_c},1)$, but we are not aware of any examples in which such roots
exist.

  We have recently observed that fermions charged under large groups acquire
much bigger dynamical masses, all things being equal at a high e.g. GUT scale,
than ordinary quarks. Should such multicharged fermions exist, they are just
too heavy to be observed today (and have either decayed early on if coupled to
the rest of the Standard Model, or become reliquial dark matter if uncoupled).
Their mass scale is dictated by strong antiscreening of the running coupling
for those larger groups (with an appropriately small number of flavors)
together with scaling properties of the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the
fermion mass.
  The generated fermion mass (assuming only few flavors, to avoid spoiling
antiscreening) grows exponentially with the number of colors as M(N_c) ~
exp(N_c) for scales much below the GUT scale. Large groups would be strongly
coupled already near the GUT scale and fermions charged thereunder have
correspondingly large masses.

utilizes dispersion of the diffraction angle, requiring tracking the diffracted
beams in space. Realization of on-chip spectropolarimetry calls thereby for
conceptually different approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that random
nanoparticle arrays on metal surfaces, enabling strong multiple scattering of
surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), produce upon illumination complicated SPP
scattered patterns, whose angular spectra are uniquely determined by the
polarization and wavelength of light, representing thereby spectropolarimetric
fingerprints. Using um-sized circular arrays of randomly distributed

adaptive mesh simulations that aim to bridge the gap between the intermediate
galactic scales and the self-gravitating prestellar cores. For this purpose we
use stratified supernova regulated ISM magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations
at the kpc scale to set up the initial conditions. We then zoom, performing a
series of concentric uniform refinement and then refining on the Jeans length
for the last levels. This allows us to reach a spatial resolution of a few
$10^{-3}$ pc. The cores are identified using a clump finder and various
criteria based on virial analysis. Their most relevant properties are computed
and, due to the large number of objects formed in the simulations, reliable
statistics are obtained. The cores properties show encouraging agreements with
observations. The mass spectrum presents a clear powerlaw at high masses with
an exponent close to $\simeq -1.3$ and a peak at about 1-2 $M_\odot$. The
velocity dispersion and the angular momentum distributions are respectively a
few times the local sound speed and a few $10^{-2}$ pc km s$^{-1}$. We also

plasma electrons and protons from colder plasma to hotter one dominates over
the flux of hot plasma electrons and protons in the opposite direction. Thus,
the plasma in the hotter part of the system becomes colder and denser during
time evolution. In the case without any interactions among particles the cold
plasma electrons and protons freely penetrate into the hot plasma. But, the
cold plasma electrons are faster than cold plasma protons and therefore they
penetrate deeper into the hotter part of the system than the protons. Thus, the
cooling of the electron and proton components of the plasma in the hotter part
of the system is different. On the other hand, in the case with the
electromagnetic interactions, owing to the plasma property, which tries to keep
the total electric current constant everywhere (close to zero in our case), the
cold plasma electrons penetrate into the hotter part of the system together
with the cold plasma protons. The plasma waves generated at the transition
region during these processes reduce the number of electrons escaping from the

clear necessary condition for graphic sequences $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ to pack is
that $\pi_1+\pi_2$, their componentwise sum, is also graphic. It is known,

general problem of determining if two sequences pack is $NP$- complete.
S.~Kundu proved in 1973 that if $\pi_2$ is almost regular, that is each element

$\pi$ with the property that $\pi+\mathbf{1}$ is graphic. By Kundu's theorem,
the sequences $\pi$ and $\mathbf{1}$ pack, and there exist edge-disjoint
realizations $G$ and $\mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a 1-factor. We call
such a $(\pi,\mathbf{1})$ packing a {\em Kundu realization}. Assume that $\pi$
is a graphic sequence, in which each term is at most $n/24$, that packs with
$\mathbf{1}$. This paper contains two results. On one hand, any two Kundu
realizations of the degree sequence $\pi+\mathbf{1}$ can be transformed into
each other through a sequence of other Kundu realizations by swap operations.
On the other hand, the same conditions ensure that any particular 1-factor can
be part of a Kundu realization of $\pi+\mathbf{1}$.

suppress the propagation of useful information and leads to the difficulty of
optimizing very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, stacking
layers with nonlinear activations is hard to approximate the intrinsic linear

  In this paper, we investigate the effect of erasing ReLUs of certain layers

erasing the last ReLU layer of all basic modules in a network usually yields
improved performance. In experiments, our approach successfully improves the

  derandomization of depth-2 LTF circuits); rewrite of some of the exposition;
  minor corrections",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the prominent current challenges in complexity theory is the attempt
to prove lower bounds for $TC^0$, the class of constant-depth, polynomial-size
circuits with majority gates. Relying on the results of Williams (2013), an
appealing approach to prove such lower bounds is to construct a non-trivial
derandomization algorithm for $TC^0$. In this work we take a first step towards
the latter goal, by proving the first positive results regarding the
derandomization of $TC^0$ circuits of depth $d>2$.
  Our first main result is a quantified derandomization algorithm for $TC^0$
circuits with a super-linear number of wires. Specifically, we construct an
algorithm that gets as input a $TC^0$ circuit $C$ over $n$ input bits with
depth $d$ and $n^{1+\exp(-d)}$ wires, runs in almost-polynomial-time, and
distinguishes between the case that $C$ rejects at most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs
and the case that $C$ accepts at most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs. In fact, our
algorithm works even when the circuit $C$ is a linear threshold circuit, rather
than just a $TC^0$ circuit (i.e., $C$ is a circuit with linear threshold gates,
which are stronger than majority gates).
  Our second main result is that even a modest improvement of our quantified
derandomization algorithm would yield a non-trivial algorithm for standard
derandomization of all of $TC^0$, and would consequently imply that
$NEXP\not\subseteq TC^0$. Specifically, if there exists a quantified
derandomization algorithm that gets as input a $TC^0$ circuit with depth $d$
and $n^{1+O(1/d)}$ wires (rather than $n^{1+\exp(-d)}$ wires), runs in time at
most $2^{n^{\exp(-d)}}$, and distinguishes between the case that $C$ rejects at
most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs and the case that $C$ accepts at most
$2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs, then there exists an algorithm with running time
$2^{n^{1-\Omega(1)}}$ for standard derandomization of $TC^0$.

the output of multiple aero-servo-elastic computer simulators of varying
complexity. In many instances, predictions from multiple simulators for the
same quantity of interest on a wind turbine are available. In this type of
situation, there is strong evidence that fusing the output from multiple
aero-servo-elastic simulators yields better predictive ability and lower model
uncertainty than using any single simulator. Hierarchical Kriging is a
multi-fidelity surrogate modelling method in which the Kriging surrogate model
of the cheap (low-fidelity) simulator is used as a trend of the Kriging
surrogate model of the higher fidelity simulator. We propose a parametric
approach to Hierarchical Kriging where the best surrogate models are selected
based on evaluating all possible combinations of the available Kriging
parameters candidates. The parametric Hierarchical Kriging approach is
illustrated by fusing the extreme flapwise bending moment at the blade root of
a large multi-megawatt wind turbine as a function of wind velocity, turbulence
and wind shear exponent in the presence of model uncertainty and
heterogeneously noisy output. The extreme responses are obtained by two widely
accepted wind turbine specific aero-servo-elastic computer simulators, FAST and
Bladed. With limited high-fidelity simulations, Hierarchical Kriging produces
more accurate predictions of validation data compared to conventional Kriging.
In addition, contrary to conventional Kriging, Hierarchical Kriging is shown to
be a robust surrogate modelling technique because it is less sensitive to the
choice of the Kriging parameters and the choice of the estimation error.

with spin-orbit coupling and an interaction kernel which is symmetric under the

to be a requirement to maximise the benefit from the advantages of AVs. We
study the ramifications of an increasing percentage of AVs on the traffic
system with and without the introduction of a dedicated AV lane on highways. We
conduct an analytical evaluation of a simplified scenario and a macroscopic
simulation of the city of Singapore under user equilibrium conditions with a
realistic traffic demand. We present findings regarding average travel time,
fuel consumption, throughput and road usage. Instead of only considering the
highways, we also focus on the effects on the remaining road network. Our
results show a reduction of average travel time and fuel consumption as a
result of increasing the portion of AVs in the system. We show that the
introduction of an AV lane is not beneficial in terms of average commute time.
Examining the effects of the AV population only, however, the AV lane provides
a considerable reduction of travel time (approx. 25%) at the price of delaying
conventional vehicles (approx. 7%). Furthermore a notable shift of travel
demand away from the highways towards major and small roads is noticed in early
stages of AV penetration of the system. Finally, our findings show that after a
certain threshold percentage of AVs the differences between AV and no AV lane
scenarios become negligible.

challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people
challenges. The article explains how these findings can be used to help
researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool
support.
  Conclusion: The organization's decision to adopt a software platform strategy
introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be understood and
addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse. Researchers need to further
investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform
development, the role of agile methods in software platforms, tool support for
testing and continuous integration in the platform context, and reuse
recommendation systems.

by a critical fraction of the population, as the resulting herd immunity
prevents future outbreaks of an epidemic. However, the effectiveness of a
campaign can engender its own undoing if individuals choose to not get
vaccinated in the belief that they are protected by herd immunity. Although
this may appear to be an optimal decision, based on a rational appraisal of
cost and benefits to the individual, it exposes the population to subsequent
outbreaks. We investigate if voluntary vaccination can emerge in a an
integrated model of an epidemic spreading on a social network of rational
agents that make informed decisions whether to be vaccinated. The information
available to each agent includes the prevalence of the disease in their local
network neighborhood and/or globally in the population, as well as the fraction
of their neighbors that are protected against the disease. Crucially, the
payoffs governing the decision of agents evolve with disease prevalence,
resulting in the co-evolution of vaccine uptake behavior with the spread of the
contagion. The collective behavior of the agents responding to local prevalence
can lead to a significant reduction in the final epidemic size, particularly
for less contagious diseases having low basic reproduction number $R_0$. Near
the epidemic threshold ($R_0\approx1$) the use of local prevalence information
can result in a dichotomous response in final vaccine coverage. The
implications of our results suggest the nature of information used by
individuals is a critical factor determining the success of public health

parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$, which probes the

estimate $S_8=0.750\pm0.059$, using peaks in the signal-to-noise range $0 \leq
{\rm S/N} \leq 4$, and accounting for various systematics, such as
multiplicative shear bias, mean redshift bias, baryon feedback, intrinsic

tighter than the constraints from the high significance peaks alone ($3 \leq

demonstrates the gain of information from low-S/N peaks. However we find that

measuring sea surface height variations, with applications ranging from
operational oceanography to climate research. Over open oceans, altimeter
return waveforms generally correspond to the Brown model, and by inversion,
estimated shape parameters provide mean surface height and wind speed. However,
in coastal areas or over inland waters, the waveform shape is often distorted
by land influence, resulting in peaks or fast decaying trailing edges. As a
result, derived sea surface heights are then less accurate and waveforms need
to be reprocessed by sophisticated algorithms. To this end, this work suggests
a novel Spatio-Temporal Altimetry Retracking (STAR) technique. We show that
STAR enables the derivation of sea surface heights over the open ocean as well
as over coastal regions of at least the same quality as compared to existing
retracking methods, but for a larger number of cycles and thus retaining more
useful data. Novel elements of our method are (a) integrating information from
spatially and temporally neighboring waveforms through a conditional random
field approach, (b) sub-waveform detection, where relevant sub-waveforms are
separated from corrupted or non-relevant parts through a sparse representation
approach, and (c) identifying the final best set of sea surfaces heights from
multiple likely heights using Dijkstra's algorithm. We apply STAR to data from
the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Envisat missions for study sites in the Gulf of
Trieste, Italy and in the coastal region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
estuary, Bangladesh. We compare to several established and recent retracking

proposed to segment the markers from 2D fluoroscopic images to achieve
semi-automatic marker detection. The proposed framework was validated on five
patient-specific 3D printed phantoms of aortic aneurysms and three stent grafts
with new marker placements, showing an average distance error of 1-3mm and an

This is compared with the temperatures derived from the ratio of the
NH3(2,2)/(1,1) inversion lines and the dust emission. Using the RADEX non-LTE
model, we derive the gas kinetic temperature modeling the measured averaged
line ratios of para-H2CO 322-221/303-202 and 321-220/303-202. The gas kinetic
temperatures derived from the para-H2CO line ratios are warm, ranging from 30
to >200 K with an average of 62 K at a spatial density of 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.
These temperatures are higher than those obtained from NH3(2,2)/(1,1) and
CH3CCH(6-5) in the OMC-1 region. The gas kinetic temperatures derived from
para-H2CO agree with those obtained from warm dust components measured in the
mid infrared (MIR), which indicates that the para-H2CO(3-2) ratios trace dense
and warm gas. The cold dust components measured in the far infrared (FIR) are
consistent with those measured with NH3(2,2)/(1,1) and the CH3CCH(6-5) line
series. With dust at MIR wavelengths and para-H2CO(3-2) on one side and dust at
FIR wavelengths, NH3(2,2)/(1,1), and CH3CCH(6-5) on the other, dust and gas
temperatures appear to be equivalent in the dense gas of the OMC-1 region, but
provide a bimodal distribution, one more directly related to star formation
than the other. The non-thermal velocity dispersions of para-H2CO are
positively correlated with the gas kinetic temperatures in regions of strong
non-thermal motion (Mach number >2.5) of the OMC-1, implying that the higher
temperature traced by para-H2CO is related to turbulence on a 0.06 pc scale.
Combining the temperature measurements with para-H2CO and NH3(2,2)/(1,1) line
ratios, we find direct evidence for the dense gas along the northern part of
the OMC-1 10 km s$^{-1}$ filament heated by radiation from the central Orion

assumed. However, constant-$l$ tori cannot match the entire range of
frequencies observed for 4U 1636-53 due to physical constraints set by the

interesting and surprising properties, such as the prevalence of long-range,

special attention and lead to mathematical subtleties. Here, we analyze the
interaction of excited hydrogen atoms in nS states (3 <= n <= 12) with
ground-state hydrogen atoms, and find that the C_6 coefficients roughly grow
with the fourth power of the principal quantum number, and can reach values in
excess of 240,000 (in atomic units) for states with n = 12. The nonretarded van
der Waals result is relevant to the distance range R << a_0/alpha, where a_0 is
the Bohr radius and alpha is the fine-structure constant. The Casimir-Polder
range encompasses the interatomic distance range a_0/alpha << R << hbar c/L,
where L is the Lamb shift energy. In this range, the contribution of
quasi-degenerate excited nP states remains nonretarded and competes with the
1/R^2 and 1/R^4 tails of the pole terms which are generated by lower-lying mP
states with 2 <= m <= n-1, due to virtual resonant emission. The dominant pole
terms are also analyzed in the Lamb shift range R >> hbar c/L. The familiar
1/R^7 asymptotics from the usual Casimir-Polder theory is found to be
completely irrelevant for the analysis of excited-state interactions. The
calculations are carried out to high precision using computer algebra in order

the influence of a set of blind pre-processing methods on the face detection
rate using the Viola-Jones algorithm. We focus on two aspects of improvement,
specifically badly illuminated faces and blurred faces. Many methods for
lighting invariant and deblurring are used in order to improve the detection
accuracy. We want to avoid using blind pre-processing methods that may obstruct
the face detector. To that end, we perform two sets of experiments. The first
set is performed to avoid any blind pre-processing method that may hurt the
face detector. The second set is performed to study the effect of the selected
pre-processing methods on images that suffer from hard conditions. We present
two manners of applying the pre-processing method to the image prior to being
used by the Viola-Jones face detector. Four different datasets are used to draw
a coherent conclusion about the potential improvement caused by using prior
enhanced images. The results demonstrate that some of the pre-processing
methods may hurt the accuracy of Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. However,
other pre-processing methods have an evident positive impact on the accuracy of
the face detector. Overall, we recommend three simple and fast blind
photometric normalization methods as a pre-processing step in order to improve
the accuracy of the pre-trained Viola-Jones face detector.

proved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially
multiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential
limitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which
arises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by
reusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot
contamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot
sequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative
method, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data
symbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot
contamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using
maximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE.
To this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a
practical random BS deployment. We prove that the reduction of pilot
contamination with SP is outweighed by the additional coherent and non-coherent
interference. Numerical results show that when both methods are optimized, RP
achieves comparable SE and EE to SP in practical scenarios.

results of a pilot study of a field centered on 3C196 using LOFAR Low Band
(56-70 MHz) observations, where we quantify various wide field and calibration
effects such as gain errors, polarized foregrounds, and ionospheric effects. We
observe a `pitchfork' structure in the 2D power spectrum of the polarized
intensity in delay-baseline space, which leaks into the modes beyond the
instrumental horizon (EoR/CD window). We show that this structure largely
arises due to strong instrumental polarization leakage ($\sim30\%$) towards
{Cas\,A} ($\sim21$ kJy at 81 MHz, brightest source in northern sky), which is
far away from primary field of view. We measure an extremely small ionospheric
diffractive scale ($r_{\text{diff}} \approx 430$ m at 60 MHz) towards {Cas\,A}
resembling pure Kolmogorov turbulence compared to $r_{\text{diff}} \sim3 - 20$

the smallest diffractive scales ever measured at these frequencies. Our work
provides insights in understanding the nature of aforementioned effects and

However, the emergence of many-body localization (MBL) owing to the interplay
between interaction and disorder, which is in stark contrast to Anderson
localization that only addresses noninteracting particles in the presence of
disorder, greatly challenges this concept because it prevents the systems from
evolving to the ergodic thermalized state. One critical evidence of MBL is the
long-time logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, and a direct observation
of it is still elusive due to the experimental challenges in multiqubit
single-shot measurement and quantum state tomography. Here we present an
experiment of fully emulating the MBL dynamics with a 10-qubit superconducting
quantum processor, which represents a spin-1/2 XY model featuring programmable
disorder and long-range spin-spin interactions. We provide essential signatures
of MBL, such as the imbalance due to the initial nonequilibrium, the violation
of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and, more importantly, the direct
evidence of the long-time logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy. Our

Comments welcome",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0196524",,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Masses of experiments have shown individual preference for fairness which
seems irrational. The reason behind it remains a focus for research. The effect
of spite (individuals are only concerned with their own relative standing) on
the evolution of fairness has attracted increasing attention from experiments,
but only has been implicitly studied in one evolutionary model. The model did
not involve high-offer rejections, which have been found in the form of
non-monotonic rejections (rejecting offers that are too high or too low) in
experiments. Here, we introduce a high offer and a non-monotonic rejection in
structured populations of finite size, and use strategy intervention to
explicitly study how spite influences the evolution of fairness: five
strategies are in sequence added into the competition of a fair strategy and a
selfish strategy. We find that spite promotes fairness, altruism inhibits
fairness, and the non-monotonic rejection can cause fairness to overcome
selfishness, which cannot happen without high-offer rejections. Particularly
for the group-structured population with seven discrete strategies, we
analytically study the effect of population size, mutation, and migration on
fairness, selfishness, altruism, and spite. A larger population size cannot
change the dominance of fairness, but it promotes altruism and inhibits
selfishness and spite. Intermediate mutation maximizes selfishness and
fairness, and minimizes spite; intermediate mutation maximizes altruism for
intermediate migration and minimizes altruism otherwise. The existence of
migration inhibits selfishness and fairness, and promotes altruism; sufficient
migration promotes spite. Our study may provide important insights into the
evolutionary origin of fairness.

split into new fermions with 3-component. In this article, we demonstrate that
Dirac fermions can also split into 3-component fermions with time reversal
symmetry (TRS) breaking while inversion symmetry is preserved. Firstly, we
conduct a symmetry analysis with the commutation relations among all symmetry
operators of a Dirac semimetal and find out the symmetry conditions of Dirac
fermions splitting into 3-component fermions. With the symmetry conditions, we
derive the $k\cdot P$ effective Hamiltonian of TRS breaking and compare it with
the Hamiltonian of inversion symmetry breaking. We find that they are different
in $\Gamma$ point eigenenergies. This can be considered as consequence of
Kramers degeneracy breaking which is a clear signature of TRS breaking.
Moreover, with the $k\cdot P$ effective Hamiltonian of the system we show that
TRS-breaking-induced 3-component fermions can split into Weyl fermions while a
small magnetic field is applied. At the end, we show our first principles
calculation results are consistent with the symmetry analysis and the $k\cdot
P$ predictions. Our work clarifies the similarities and the differences between
TRS-breaking-induced 3-component fermions and
inversion-symmetry-breaking-induced 3-component fermions and extends the scope

to the dipolar interaction between the nanoparticles, the localized plasmons
couple to form extended collective modes. Using an open quantum system approach
in which the collective plasmons are interacting with vacuum electromagnetic
modes and which, importantly, readily incorporates retardation via the
light-matter coupling, we analytically evaluate the resulting radiative
frequency shifts of the plasmonic bandstructure. For subwavelength-sized
nanoparticles, our analytical treatment provides an excellent quantitative
agreement with the results stemming from laborious numerical calculations based
on fully-retarded solutions to Maxwell's equations. Indeed, the explicit
expressions for the plasmonic spectrum which we provide showcase how including
retardation gives rise to a logarithmic singularity in the bandstructure of
transverse-polarized plasmons. We further study the impact of retardation
effects on the propagation of plasmonic excitations along the chain. While for
the longitudinal modes, retardation has a negligible effect, we find that the
retarded dipolar interaction can significantly modify the plasmon propagation
in the case of transverse-polarized modes. Moreover, our results elucidate the

temperature-dependent coupling was proposed in the literature. We investigate
its effect on QCD matter with and without strong magnetic fields. Compared with
the fixed coupling constant, the running coupling leads to a drastic change in

The crossover transition of QCD matter at finite temperature is characterized
by the pseudocritical temperature $T_\mathrm{pc}$, which is generally
determined by the peak of the derivative of the quark condensate with respect
to the temperature $d\phi/dT$, or equivalently, by the derivative of the quark
dynamical mass $d M/dT$. In a strong magnetic field, the temperature- and
magnetic-field-dependent coupling $G(eB,T)$ was recently introduced to account
for inverse magnetic catalysis. We propose an analytical relation between the
two criteria $d\phi/dT$ and $dM/dT$ and show a discrepancy between them in

approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as IVs that can
sometimes be leveraged to recover valid inferences about a given
exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key IV
identification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV
cannot have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the
exposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic
level of prior knowledge about the mechanism by which genetic markers causally
affect the outcome. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion
restriction can seldom be ruled out in practice. To address this concern, we
introduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the
exclusion restriction under data generating mechanisms commonly assumed in MR
literature. The proposed approach named ""MR G-Estimation under No Interaction
with Unmeasured Selection"" (MR GENIUS) improves on Robins' G-estimation by
making it robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the
exclusion restriction assumption. In certain key settings, MR GENIUS reduces to
the estimator of Lewbel (2012) which is widely used in econometrics but appears
largely unappreciated in MR literature. More generally, MR GENIUS generalizes
Lewbel's estimator to several key practical MR settings, including
multiplicative causal models for binary outcome, multiplicative and odds ratio
exposure models, case control study design and censored survival outcomes.

vast range of scales emerged. It goes under the name of ${\Lambda}$CDM.
However, there are still challenging questions that remain unanswered by this
model, such as what causes the observed accelerated expansion of the universe,
and many alternatives have been proposed. This thesis concerns an approach to
test such models known as ""Effective Theory of Dark Energy"" . It applies to all
models where general relativity is modified by adding a single scalar degree of
freedom, called ""scalar-tensor theories"". In Chapter 1 I summarise the most
general class of such theories currently known, called ""Degenerate higher-Order
Scalar-Tensor"" (DHOST) theories. In Chapter 2, I introduce the effective theory
of dark energy. The inclusion of a general coupling between matter and the
gravitational sector is the subject of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 analyses in details
the stability of different classes of theories. Notably, I show that the most
general class of theories free from instabilities reduces to the so-called
Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories, up to a non minimal coupling to
matter. Another goal of the thesis is to study the observable effects of
deviations from ${\Lambda}$CDM. In Chapter 5, I consider the possibility of an
interaction between dark matter and dark energy and I analyse the constraining
power of future surveys on the free parameters of the theory. Chapter 6 focuses
on the observational effects of theories where a kinetic mixing between matter
and the scalar field exists. This gives a peculiar and potentially observable
effect, namely the weakening of gravity at large scale structure scales.

result that a previously published $3$-approximation is an exact algorithm.
  The nearest neighbor metric can be viewed as a special case of a
density-based distance used in machine learning, or it can be seen as an
example of a manifold metric. Previous computational research on such metrics
despaired of computing exact distances on account of the apparent difficulty of
minimizing over all continuous paths between a pair of points. We leverage the
exact computation of the nearest neighbor metric to compute sparse spanners and
persistent homology. We also explore the behavior of the metric built from
point sets drawn from an underlying distribution and consider the more general
case of inputs that are finite collections of path-connected compact sets.
  The main results connect several classical theories such as the conformal
change of Riemannian metrics, the theory of positive definite functions of
Schoenberg, and screw function theory of Schoenberg and Von Neumann. We develop
novel proof techniques based on the combination of screw functions and
Lipschitz extensions that may be of independent interest.

to analyze nine months of STEREO and HMI data. In the first approach, we
determine whether or not new large east-limb active regions are detected
seismically on the far side before they appear Earth side and study how the
detectability of these regions relates to their EUV intensity. We find that,
while there is a range of EUV intensities for which far-side regions may or may
not be detected seismically, there appears to be an intensity level above which
they are almost always detected and an intensity level below which they are
never detected. In the second approach, we analyze concurrent extreme
ultraviolet and helioseismic far-side observations. We find that 100% (22) of
the far-side seismic regions correspond to an extreme ultraviolet plage; 95% of
these either became a NOAA-designated magnetic region when reaching the east
limb or were one before crossing to the far side. A low but significant
correlation is found between the seismic signature strength and the EUV
intensity of a farside region.

energetic processing not only modifies the interstellar matter but also injects
chemical species in the gas phase. In this work, we study the effect of the CR
on the astrophysical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). For events in
which many electrons are stripped out from the PAH by interaction with a heavy
cosmic ray particle, coulomb explosion takes place and carbon chains are
produced. The fragments production rates of carbon chains are of particular
interest for astrophysical models. We computed PAH multi-ionization cross
sections with an Independent Atom and Electron collisional model. We introduced
and used a model to predict the fragmentation pattern for the coulomb
explosion. Experimental measurements on small hydrocarbons, C$_{60}$ and PAHs
were used to set confidence intervals on the calculations results.
  The carbon chains production rates were calculated using different CR fluxes
and elemental compositions, to account for the variations expected in various
astrophysical environments. A range of PAH sizes and compactness were also
explored. The PAH lifetime with respect to a standard interstellar CR flux
(corresponding to an H$_2$ ionization rate of $\zeta \approx$
6.10$^{-17}$s$^{-1}$) is found to be in the order of a few billion years. The
production rates of interstellar carbon chains containing around 5-15 carbon
atoms are in the order of few to many tens of percent of the H$_2$ ionization
rate $\zeta$. The exact rate value relies on the nature of the PAH and on the
CR composition. In diffuse medium, with ten percent of the available cosmic
carbon locked in PAHs, this process leads to carbon chain fractional abundances
at steady state, in the range of $10^{-15}$-$10^{-14}$, with a confidence
interval of about one order of magnitude. It reaches $10^{-13}$ in quiescent

by construction that the target correlation functions of the original

and its multiplication corresponds to joint measurement. We extend Baudot and
Bennequin's definition of information cohomology to this setting, as a derived
functor in the category of modules over the structure ring, and show explicitly
that the bar construction gives a projective resolution in that category,
recovering in this way the cochain complexes previously considered in the
literature. Finally, we study the particular case of a one-parameter family of
coefficients made of functions of probability distributions. The only
1-cocycles are Shannon entropy or Tsallis $\alpha$-entropy, depending on the
value of the parameter.

of aniferromagnetic hexagons (with nearest-neighbor interaction, $J_A>0$)
coupled via ferromagnetic bonds (with exchange interaction, $J_F <0$). It
applies to the spin-gapped organic materials, m-MPYNN.X (for $\mathrm{X}=$I,
BF4, ClO4), and for $|J_F|\gg J_A$, it reduces to the spin-$1$ kagom\'e
Heisenberg antiferromagnet (KHA). Motivated by the recent finding of trimerized
singlet (TS) ground state for spin-1 KHA, we investigate the evolution of the
ground state of Hida model from weak to strong $J_F/J_A$ using mean-field
triplon analysis and Schwinger boson mean-field theory. Our triplon analysis of
Hida model shows that its uniform hexagonal singlet (HS) ground state (for weak
$J_F/J_A$) gives way to the dimerized hexagonal singlet (D-HS) ground state for
all $J_F$'s beyond a moderate $J_F/J_A$. From the Schwinger boson calculations,
we find that the evolution from the uniform HS phase for spin-1/2 Hida model to
the TS phase for spin-1 KHA happens through two quantum phase transitions: 1)
the spontaneous dimerization transition at $J_F/J_A \sim -0.28$ from the
uniform HS to D-HS phase, and 2) the moment formation transition at $J_F/J_A
\sim -1.46$, across which the pair of spin-1/2's on every FM bond begin to
express as a bound moment that tends to spin-1 for large negative $J_F$'s. The
TS ground state of spin-1 KHA is thus adiabatically connected to the D-HS
ground state of the Hida model. Our calculations clearly imply that the
\ce{m-MPYNN.X} salts realize the D-HS phase at low temperatures, which can be
ascertained through neutron diffraction.

necessary for the advanced control of batteries, which could potentially
increase their lifetime through e.g. reconfiguration. To tackle this problem,
an enhanced reduced-order electrochemical model is used here. This model allows
considering a wider operating range and thermal coupling between cells, the
latter turning out to be significant. The resulting nonlinear model is
exploited for state estimation through unscented Kalman filters (UKF). A sensor
network composed of one sensor node per battery cell is deployed. Each sensor
node is equipped with a local UKF, which uses available local measurements
together with additional information coming from neighboring sensor nodes. Such
state estimation scheme gives rise to a partition-based unscented Kalman filter
(PUKF). The method is validated on data from a detailed simulator for a battery
pack comprised of six cells, with reconfiguration capabilities. The results
show that the distributed approach outperforms the centralized one in terms of
computation time at the expense of a very low increase of mean-square
estimation error.

computer science for over three decades, ever since the discovery of RNC
matching algorithms. Within this question, the case of planar graphs has

is far harder than finding one (the former is #P-complete and the latter is in

in a crucial way. Our main new idea is an NC algorithm for finding a face of

excitation of electrons at the metal surface, also known as surface plasmons.
These collective excitations lead to resonances that enable the confinement of
light in deep-subwavelength regions, thereby leading to large near-field
enhancements. The simulation of plasmon resonances presents notable challenges.
From the modeling perspective, the realistic behavior of conduction-band
electrons in metallic nanostructures is not captured by Maxwell's equations,
thus requiring additional modeling. From the simulation perspective, the
disparity in length scales stemming from the extreme field localization demands
efficient and accurate numerical methods.
  In this paper, we develop the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
method to solve Maxwell's equations augmented with the hydrodynamic model for
the conduction-band electrons in noble metals. This method enables the
efficient simulation of plasmonic nanostructures while accounting for the
nonlocal interactions between electrons and the incident light. We introduce a
novel postprocessing scheme to recover superconvergent solutions and
demonstrate the convergence of the proposed HDG method for the simulation of a
2D gold nanowire and a 3D periodic annular nanogap structure. The results of
the hydrodynamic model are compared to those of a simplified local response
model, showing that differences between them can be significant at the

phaseless far-field data at a fixed frequency. The main difficulty of this
problem is the so-called translation invariance property of the modulus of the
far-field pattern generated by one plane wave as the incident field. Based on
our previous work (J. Comput. Phys. 345 (2017), 58-73), the translation
invariance property of the phaseless far-field pattern can be broken by using
infinitely many sets of superpositions of two plane waves as the incident
fields at a fixed frequency. In this paper, we prove that the obstacle and the
index of refraction of an inhomogeneous medium can be uniquely determined by
the phaseless far-field patterns generated by infinitely many sets of
superpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a fixed
frequency under the condition that the obstacle is a priori known to be a
sound-soft or non-absorbing impedance obstacle and the index of refraction $n$
of the inhomogeneous medium is real-valued and satisfies that either $n-1\ge
c_1$ or $n-1\le-c_1$ in the support of $n-1$ for some positive constant $c_1$.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first uniqueness result in inverse
scattering with phaseless far-field data. Our proofs are based essentially on
the limit of the normalized eigenvalues of the far-field operators which is
also established in this paper by using a factorization of the far-field
operators.

influence of the warm and dense environment on the emitters, plasma screening
is considered within a perturbative approach to the Hamiltonian. The plasma
affects the many-particle system resulting in energy shifts of emission as well

strongly influenced by ionization and excitation processes within the plasma.
Comparing with the widely known FLYCHK code and the temperature distribution

equations for the edge lengths of a d-dimensional piecewise linear (PL)
simplicial geometry. More recently, this system of discrete Ricci flow (DRF)
equations was further simplified by explicitly constructing the Forman-Ricci
tensor associated to each edge, thereby diagonalizing the first-order
differential operator and avoiding the need to invert large sparse matrices at
each time step. We recently showed analytically and numerically that these
equations converge for axisymmetric 3-geometries to the corresponding continuum
RF equations. We demonstrate here that these DRF equations yield an explicit
numerical realization of Thurston's geometrization procedure for a discrete 3D
axially-symmetric neckpinch geometry by using surgery to explicitly integrate
through its Type-1 neck pinch singularity. A cubic-spline-based adaptive mesh
was required to complete the evolution. Our numerically efficient simulations
yield the expected Thurston decomposition of the sufficiently pinched axially
symmetric geometry into its unique geometric structure -- a direct product of
two lobes, each collapsing toward a 3-sphere geometry. The structure of our
curvature may be used to better inform one of the vertex and edge weighting
factors that appear in the Forman's expression of Ricci curvature on graphs.

a wealth of problems in high-energy physics. A typical example is the
classification of physics objects. Supervised machine learning methods allow
for significant improvements in classification problems by taking into account
observable correlations and by learning the optimal selection from examples,
e.g. from Monte Carlo simulations. Even more promising is the usage of deep
learning techniques. Methods like deep convolutional networks might be able to
catch features from low-level parameters that are not exploited by default
cut-based methods.
  These ideas could be particularly beneficial for measurements in heavy-ion
collisions, because of the very large multiplicities. Indeed, machine learning
methods potentially perform much better in systems with a large number of
degrees of freedom compared to cut-based methods. Moreover, many key heavy-ion
observables are most interesting at low transverse momentum where the
underlying event is dominant and the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low.
  In this work, recent developments of machine- and deep learning applications
in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE will be presented, with focus on a deep
learning-based b-jet tagging approach and the measurement of low-mass
dielectrons. While the b-jet tagger is based on a mixture of shallow
fully-connected and deep convolutional networks, the low-mass dielectron
measurement uses gradient boosting and shallow neural networks. Both methods
are very promising compared to default cut-based methods.

  In this paper we consider the example of such an analysis applied to the
increasing exponential signal and the sinusoidal noise. It is proved that if
the signal rapidly tends to infinity, then the so-called reconstruction errors
of SSA do not uniformly tend to zero as the series length tends to infinity.
More precisely, in this case any finite number of last terms of the error
series do not tend to any finite or infinite values.
  On the contrary, for the ""discretization"" scheme with the bounded from above
exponential signal, all elements of the error series tend to zero.
  This effect shows that the discretization model can be an effective tool in
the theoretical SSA considerations with increasing signals.

in situ to change this wave path at will. Without resorting to any active
materials, the current system harnesses bistablilty in its unit cells, such
that tuning can be performed simply by a dial-in action. Consequently, a
topological transition mechanism inspired by the quantum valley Hall effect can
be achieved. We show the possibility of tuning in a variety of topological and
traditional waveguides in the same system, and numerically investigate key
qualitative and quantitative differences between them. We observe that even
though both types of waveguides can lead to significant wave transmission for a
certain frequency range, topological waveguides are distinctive as they support
robust, back scattering immune, one-way wave propagation.

The possibility to implement advanced measurement techniques and long time

simpler to handle compared to much more complex 3D physical systems that are
typical of geo- and astrophysical issues (ocean surface or internal waves,
magnetized plasmas or strongly rotating and/or stratified flows). When the
forcing is small the observed wave turbulence is consistent with the
predictions of the Weak Turbulent Theory. Here we focus on the case of stronger
forcing for which coherent structures can be observed. These structures look
similar to the folds and D-cones that are commonly observed for strongly
deformed static thin elastic sheets (crumpled paper) except that they evolve
dynamically in our forced system. We describe their evolution and show that
their emergence is associated with statistical intermittency (lack of self
similarity) of strongly nonlinear wave turbulence. This behavior is reminiscent
of intermittency in Navier-Stokes turbulence. Experimental data show hints of
the weak to strong turbulence transition. However, due to technical limitations
and dissipation, the strong nonlinear regime remains out of reach of
experiments and therefore has been explored numerically.
