different Skryme force interactions for the prediction of the M1 strength
function associated with $^{52}$Cr, in particular due to the tensor part of the
Skyrme force.$^{52}$Cr was chosen due to the recent interest experimentally in
this nucleus and the clear data avaliable for comparison.
  The method used involves applying an instantaneous boost to the wavefunction
at the beginning of the dynamical calculations in order to initiate a broadband
excitation of the nucleus, following which a Fourier analysis is made.
  The results of the TDHF simulation found broad agreement with experiment for
the range of energies which excite an M1 transition for a variety of forces.
The tensor terms appear to be important in qualitatively changing the details
of the strength distribution in the main part of the strength function between
around 8 and 12 MeV.

transport prior to the asymptotic hydrodynamic dispersion regime, in which
solute motion may be described by the average flow velocity and a hydrodynamic
dispersion coefficient. High performance numerical flow and transport
simulations of solute breakthrough at the outlet of a sand-like porous medium
evidence marked deviations from the hydrodynamic dispersion paradigm and
identifies two distinct regimes. The first regime is characterized by a broad
distribution of advective residence times in single pores. The second regime is
characterized by diffusive mass transfer into low-velocity region in the wake
of solute grains. These mechanisms are quantified systematically in the
framework of a time-domain random walk for the motion of marked elements
(particles) of the transported material quantity. The model is parameterized
with the characteristics of the porous medium under consideration and captures
both pre-asymptotic regimes. Macroscale transport is described by an
integro-differential equation for solute concentration, whose memory kernels
are given in terms of the distribution of mean pore velocities and trapping
times. This approach quantifies the physical non-equilibrium caused by a broad
distribution of mass transfer time scales, both advective and diffusive, on the
representative elementary volume (REV). Thus, while the REV indicates the scale
at which medium properties like porosity can be uniquely defined, this does not
imply that transport can be characterized by hydrodynamic dispersion.

origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this scenario, the baryon
asymmetry of the Universe is reprocessed from the lepton asymmetry by
electroweak sphaleron processes. Provided that sphalerons are fast enough to
maintain equilibrium, the values of the baryon and lepton asymmetries are
related to each other. Usually, this relation is used to find the value of the
baryon asymmetry at the time of the sphaleron freeze-out. To put in other
words, the formula which is valid only when the sphalerons are fast, is applied
at the moment when they are actually switched off. In this paper, we examine
the validity of such a treatment. To this end, we solve the full system of
kinetic equations for low-scale leptogenesis. This system includes equations
describing the production of the lepton asymmetry in oscillations of
right-handed neutrinos, as well as a separate kinetic equation for the baryon
asymmetry. We show that for some values of the model parameters, the
corrections to the standard approach are sizeable. We also present a feasible
improvement to the ordinary procedure, which accounts for these corrections.

two unrelated mechanisms generating these different odd-$\omega$ pair

learning approaches to dialogue processing is often either cleaned-up or wholly

well systems trained on such clean data generalise to real spontaneous

systematically adding natural spontaneous incremental dialogue phenomena such

in modern theoretical physics and cosmology. This short review faces this
challenge under a novel perspective. Instead of separating quantum-gravity
effects of a specific model between UV and IR regimes, we consider a general
feature, possibly common to many frameworks, where all scales are affected and
spacetime geometry is characterized by a complex critical exponent. This leaves
a log-oscillating modulation pattern in the cosmic microwave background
spectrum and gives a unique opportunity, illustrated with the example of a
multi-fractional theory, to test quantum gravities at cosmological scales.

$s$ and $t$, whether the nth tensor power of $s$ can be obtained from the
$(n+o(n))$th tensor power of t by applying linear maps to the tensor legs (this
we call restriction), when $n$ goes to infinity. In this context, Volker
Strassen, striving to understand the complexity of matrix multiplication,
introduced in 1986 the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. Essentially, the
asymptotic restriction problem for a family of tensors $X$, closed under direct
sum and tensor product, reduces to finding all maps from $X$ to the reals that
are monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under
direct sum and multiplicative under tensor product, which Strassen named
spectral points. Strassen created the support functionals, which are spectral
points for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily of all tensors.
  Universal spectral points are spectral points for the family of all tensors.
The construction of nontrivial universal spectral points has been an open
problem for more than thirty years. We construct for the first time a family of
nontrivial universal spectral points over the complex numbers, using quantum
entropy and covariants: the quantum functionals. In the process we connect the
asymptotic spectrum to the quantum marginal problem and to the entanglement
polytope.
  To demonstrate the asymptotic spectrum, we reprove (in hindsight) recent
results on the cap set problem by reducing this problem to computing asymptotic
spectrum of the reduced polynomial multiplication tensor, a prime example of
Strassen. A better understanding of our universal spectral points construction
may lead to further progress on related questions. We additionally show that
the quantum functionals characterise asymptotic slice rank for complex tensors.

a time-oscillating torque and periodic variations in the spin-precession

how these signals can be measured using existing experimental technology,

relativity, with loop corrections are treated in a simple approximation. We
consider Higgs inflation on the plateau, at a critical point, at a hilltop and
in a false vacuum. In the last case there are only minor differences. Otherwise
we find that in the Palatini formulation the tensor-to-scalar ratio is
consistently suppressed, spanning the range $1\times10^{-13}<r<7\times10^{-5}$,
compared to the metric case result $2\times10^{-5}<r<0.2$. Even when the values
of $n_s$ and $r$ overlap, the running and running of the running are different
in the two formulations. Therefore, if Higgs is the inflaton, inflationary
observables can be used to distinguish between different gravitational degrees
of freedom, in this case to determine whether the connection is an independent
variable. Non-detection of $r$ in foreseeable future observations would not
rule out Higgs inflation, only its metric variant. We conclude that in order to
fix the theory of Higgs inflation, not only the particle physics UV completion
but also the gravitational degrees of freedom have to be explicated.

Relativistic Perturbation Theory (GRPT) is able to make predictions of

presence of non-linearities physically occurring on much smaller scales (down
to those describing galactic potential wells) can strongly affect the asymmetry
estimators. These can lead to cancellations of the relativistic terms, and sign
changes in the estimators on scales up to r ~ 50 Mpc/h. On the other hand, with
an appropriate non-linear gravitational potential, the results obtained using
Newtonian theory can successfully describe the asymmetry on smaller, non-linear
scales (r < 20 Mpc/h) where gravitational redshift is the dominant term. On
larger scales the asymmetry is much smaller in magnitude, and measurement is
not within reach of current observations. This is in agreement with the
observational results obtained by Gaztnaga et al. and the first detection of

$2.7\sigma$ level by applying a shell-averaged estimator to the

has been recently measured in galaxy clusters, but smaller than scales for
which linear perturbation theory is likely to be accurate. The detection
significance varies by 0.5$\sigma$ with the details of our measurement and
tests for systematic effects. We have also devised two null tests to check for
various survey systematics and show that both results are consistent with the
null hypothesis. We measure the dipole moment of the cross-correlation
function, and from this the asymmetry is also detected, at the $2.8 \sigma$

approximately consistent with the expectations of General Relativity and a

predictions using numerical simulations in a companion paper.

gas as well as pebbles and planetesimals in the midplanes of planet-forming
disks. The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be
unchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative
abundances of molecules in this planet-building material. To assess the impact
of disk chemistry during the era of planet formation, an extensive kinetic
chemistry gas-grain reaction network is utilised to evolve the abundances of
chemical species over time. Given a high level of ionisation, chemical
evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few
times $10^{5}$ yrs, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H$_{2}$O and the
O$_{2}$ icelines. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major
elemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional
""stepfunction"" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as
defined by sharp changes at icelines of H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$ and CO) evolves over
time, and cannot be assumed fixed. In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K),
gaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO$_{2}$ and other
more complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O$_{2}$ and CO
thermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature
than suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is
ionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the
atmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed
atmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have
formed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and
implemented into planet formation models.

from macroscopically broken time-reversal symmetry by the scalar spin chirality

dependence such that the spin of low-mass haloes/galaxies tend to be parallel
with the LSS, while that of massive haloes/galaxies tend to be perpendicular
with the LSS. It is still unclear how this mass dependence is built up over
time. We use N-body simulations to trace the evolution of the halo spin-LSS
correlation and find that at early times the spin of all halo progenitors is
parallel with the LSS. As time goes on, mass collapsing around massive halo is
more isotropic, especially the recent mass accretion along the slowest
collapsing direction is significant and it brings the halo spin to be
perpendicular with the LSS. Adopting the $fractional$ $anisotropy$ (FA)
parameter to describe the degree of anisotropy of the large-scale environment,
we find that the spin-LSS correlation is a strong function of the environment
such that a higher FA (more anisotropic environment) leads to an aligned
signal, and a lower anisotropy leads to a misaligned signal. In general, our
results show that the spin-LSS correlation is a combined consequence of mass
flow and halo growth within the cosmic web. Our predicted environmental

techniques such as regularization and data augmentation, that ""memorize""
information about the training dataset in the model yet the model is as
accurate and predictive as a conventionally trained model. We then explain how
the adversary can extract memorized information from the model.
  We evaluate our techniques on standard ML tasks for image classification

production, and $tW$ associated production mediated by $V_{tb}$, give charge
symmetric contributions at leading order in QCD. Therefore, using specific
kinematic features of the signal, we construct a charge asymmetry in the
di-lepton final state which, due also to a reduction of systematic
uncertainties in the asymmetry, is potentially sensitive to $V_{td}$ suppressed
effects. In particular, using signal and background simulations up to detector

evidence for multi-modality and a sharp cut-off in the mass distribution. We
find overwhelming evidence for a bimodal distribution, in agreement with
previous literature, and report for the first time positive evidence for a
sharp cut-off at a maximum neutron star mass. We measure the maximum mass to be
$2.0M_\odot < m_\mathrm{max} < 2.2M_\odot$ (68\%), $2.0M_\odot <
m_\mathrm{max}< 2.6M_\odot$ (90\%), and evidence for a cut-off is robust
against the choice of model for the mass distribution and to removing the most
extreme (highest mass) neutron stars from the dataset. If this sharp cut-off is
interpreted as the maximum stable neutron star mass allowed by the equation of
state of dense matter, our measurement puts constraints on the equation of
state. For a set of realistic equations of state that support $>2M_\odot$
neutron stars, our inference of $m_\mathrm{max}$ is able to distinguish between
models at odds ratios of up to $12:1$, whilst under a flexible piecewise
polytropic equation of state model our maximum mass measurement improves
constraints on the pressure at $3-7\times$ the nuclear saturation density by
$\sim 30-50\%$ compared to simply requiring $m_\mathrm{max}> 2M_\odot$. We
obtain a lower bound on the maximum sound speed attained inside the neutron

Advanced LIGO detectors thus far, it is becoming possible to constrain the
properties of the BBH merger population in order to better understand the
formation of these systems. Black hole (BH) spin orientations are one of the
cleanest discriminators of formation history, with BHs in dynamically formed
binaries in dense stellar environments expected to have spins distributed
isotropically, in contrast to isolated populations where stellar evolution is
expected to induce BH spins preferentially aligned with the orbital angular
momentum. In this work we propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to
characterizing the spin properties of LIGO's BBH population. Using measurements
of the effective spin of the binaries, which is LIGO's best constrained spin
parameter, we introduce a simple parameter to quantify the fraction of the
population that is isotropically distributed, regardless of the spin magnitude
distribution of the population. Once the orientation characteristics of the
population have been determined, we show how measurements of effective spin can
be used to directly constrain the underlying BH spin magnitude distribution.
Although we find that the majority of the current effective spin measurements
are too small to be informative, with LIGO's four BBH candidates we find a
slight preference for an underlying population with aligned spins over one with
isotropic spins (with an odds ratio of 1.1). We argue that it will be possible
to distinguish symmetric and anti-symmetric populations at high confidence with
tens of additional detections, although mixed populations may take
significantly more detections to disentangle. We also derive preliminary spin
magnitude distributions for LIGO's black holes, under the assumption of aligned
or isotropic populations.

component separation. We identify configurations of frequency bands that
minimize the `model errors' caused by fitting simple parametric models to more
complex `true' foreground spectra, which bias the inferred CMB signal. We find
that: (a) fits employing a simple two parameter modified blackbody (MBB) dust
model tend to produce significant bias in the recovered polarized CMB signal in
the presence of physically realistic dust foregrounds; (b) generalized MBB
models with three additional parameters reduce this bias in most cases, but

FSRQs B2 1520+31 and PKS 1510-089 detected almost continuously over a time
integration of 3-days between August 2008 - October 2015. The observed flux
variation is large, spanning $\gtrsim 2$ orders of magnitude between the
extremes except for Mrk~421. We compute the flux distributions and compare with
Gaussian and lognormal ones. We find that the 3 blazars have distribution
consistent with a lognormal, suggesting that the variability is of a
non-linear, multiplicative nature. This is further supported by the computation
of the flux-rms relation, which is observed to be linear for the 3 blazars.
However, for NGC 1275, the distribution does not seem to be represented either
by a lognormal or a Gaussian, while its flux-rms relation is still found to be
linear. We also compute the power spectra, which suggest the presence of a
break, but are consistent with typical scale-free power-law shot noise. The
results are broadly consistent with the statistical properties of the magnetic
reconnection powered minijets-in-a-jet model. We discuss other possible
scenarios and implications of these observations on jet processes and
connections with the central engine.

but its inference in the deep interior is complicated by a systematic
center-to-limb effect in helioseismic measurement techniques. Previously, an
empirical method, removing travel-time shifts measured for east-west traveling
waves in the equatorial area from those measured for north-south traveling
waves in the central meridian area, was used, but its validity and accuracy
need to be assessed. Here we develop a new method to separate the
center-to-limb effect, \delta\tau_CtoL, and meridional-flow-induced travel-time
shifts, \delta\tau_MF, in a more robust way. Using 7-yr observations of the
SDO/HMI, we exhaustively measure travel-time shifts between two surface
locations along the solar disk's radial direction for all azimuthal angles and
all skip distances. The measured travel-time shifts are a linear combination of
\delta\tau_CtoL and \delta\tau_MF, which can be disentangled through solving
the linear equation set. The \delta\tau_CtoL is found isotropic relative to the
azimuthal angle, and the \delta\tau_MF are then inverted for the meridional
circulation. Our inversion results show a three-layer flow structure, with
equatorward flow found between about 0.82 and 0.91 R_sun for low latitude areas
and between about 0.85 and 0.91 R_sun for higher latitude areas. Poleward flows
are found below and above the equatorward flow zones, indicating a double-cell
circulation in each hemisphere.

such as autonomous navigation. It however requires a human supervisor to
oversee the training process and send correct control commands to robots
without feedback, which is always prone to error and expensive. To minimize
human involvement and avoid manual labeling of data in the robotic autonomous
navigation with imitation learning, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised
imitation learning solution based on a multi-sensory design. This solution
includes a suboptimal sensor policy based on sensor fusion to automatically
label states encountered by a robot to avoid human supervision during training.
In addition, a recording policy is developed to throttle the adversarial affect
of learning too much from the suboptimal sensor policy. This solution allows
the robot to learn a navigation policy in a self-supervised manner. With
extensive experiments in indoor environments, this solution can achieve near
human performance in most of the tasks and even surpasses human performance in
case of unexpected events such as hardware failures or human operation errors.
To best of our knowledge, this is the first work that synthesizes sensor fusion
and imitation learning to enable robotic autonomous navigation in the real
world without human supervision.

reduction of the neutron star magnetic dipole moment during binary evolution
leading to low mass X-ray binaries and eventually to millisecond pulsars:
Quantized vortex lines in the neutron star core superfluid will pin against the
quantized flux lines of the proton superconductor. As the neutron star spins
down in the wind accretion phase of binary evolution, outward motion of vortex
lines will reduce the dipole magnetic moment in proportion to the rotation
rate. The presence of a toroidal array of flux lines makes this mechanism
inevitable and independent of the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes.
The incompressibility of the flux-line array (Abrikosov lattice) determines the
epoch when the mechanism will be effective throughout the neutron star. Flux
vortex pinning will not be effective during the initial young radio pulsar
phase. It will, however, be effective and reduce the dipole moment in
proportion with the rotation rate during the epoch of spindown by wind
accretion as proposed by Srinivasan et al. The mechanism operates also in the
presence of vortex creep.

bulge and southern disk of the Galaxy. However, a detailed study of these
regions, which includes $\sim 36$ globular clusters (GCs) and thousands of open
clusters is by no means an easy challenge. High differential reddening and
severe crowding along the line of sight makes highly hamper to reliably
distinguish stars belonging to different populations and/or systems. Aims: The
aim of this study is to separate stars that likely belong to the Galactic GC
NGC 6544 from its surrounding field by means of proper motion (PM) techniques.
Methods: This work was based upon a new astrometric reduction method optimized
for images of the VVV survey. Results: Photometry over the six years baseline
of the survey allowed us to obtain a mean precision of $\sim0.51$ mas/yr, in
each PM coordinate, for stars with Ks < 15 mag. In the area studied here,
cluster stars separate very well from field stars, down to the main sequence
turnoff and below, allowing us to derive for the first time the absolute PM of
NGC 6544. Isochrone fitting on the clean and differential reddening corrected
cluster color magnitude diagram yields an age of $\sim$ 11-13 Gyr, and
metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.5 dex, in agreement with previous studies restricted to
the cluster core. We were able to derive the cluster orbit assuming an
axisymmetric model of the Galaxy and conclude that NGC 6544 is likely a halo
GC. We have not detected tidal tail signatures associated to the cluster, but a
remarkable elongation in the galactic center direction has been found. The
precision achieved in the PM determination also allows us to separate bulge
stars from foreground disk stars, enabling the kinematical selection of bona
fide bulge stars across the whole survey area. Our results show that VVV data
is perfectly suitable for this kind of analysis.

heptane (CB7CB), is composed of two rigid rod-like cyanobiphenyl segments
connected by a flexible aliphatic link with seven methyl groups. CB7CB and
other nematic dimers are of interest due to their tendency to adopt bent
configurations and to form two states possessing a modulated nematic director
structure, namely, the twist bend nematic, NTB, and the oblique helicoidal
cholesteric, ChOH, which occurs when the achiral dimer is doped with a chiral
additive and exposed to an external electric or magnetic field. We characterize
the material parameters as functions of temperature in the entire temperature
range of the N phase, including the pre-transitional regions near the N-NTB and
N-to-isotropic (I) transitions. The splay constant K11 is determined by two
direct and independent techniques, namely, detection of the Frederiks
transition and measurement of director fluctuation amplitudes by dynamic light
scattering (DLS). The bend K33 and twist K22 constants are measured by DLS. K33
being the smallest of the three constants, shows a strong non-monotonous
temperature dependence with a negative slope in both N-I and N-NTB
pretransitional regions. The measured ratio K11/K22 is larger than 2 in the
entire nematic temperature range. The orientational viscosities associated with
splay, twist and bend fluctuations in the N phase are comparable to those of
nematics formed by rod-like molecules. All three show strong temperature
dependence, increasing sharply near the N-NTB transition.

Our key idea is to build a tree of local control policies represented by neural

policy that attempts to achieve the task from a small set of initial states,
each subsequent policy expands the set of successful initial states by driving
the new states to existing ""good"" states. Our algorithm utilizes the value

discrepancies were due to 'temperature fluctuations' in the plasma, but the
amplitude of such fluctuations remain unexplained by standard phtoionization
modeling. In this letter we show that large amplitude temperature oscillations
are expected to form in gaseous nebulae photoionized by short-period binary
stars. Such stars yield periodically varying ionizing radiation fields, which
induce periodic oscilla- tions in the heating-minus-cooling function across the
nebula. For flux oscillation periods of a few days any temperature
perturbations in the gas with frequencies similar to those of the ionizing
source will undergo resonant amplification. In this case, the rate of growth of
the perturbations increases with the amplitude of the variations of the
ionizing flux and with decreasing nebular equilibrium temperature. We also
present a line ratios diagnostic plot that combines [O III] collisional lines
and O II recombination lines for diagnosing equilibrium and fluctuation am-
plitude temperatures in gaseous nebulae. When applying this diagnostic to the
planetary nebula M 1-42 we find an equilibrium temperature of ~6000 K and a

small-scale crisis of massive cold dark matter (CDM) candidates.However, recent
analyses of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum set a tight lower bound on
their mass of $m\gtrsim 10^{-21}$ eV which makes them much less relevant from
an astrophysical point of view. An important caveat to these numerical studies
is that they do not take into account attractive self-interactions among
ultra-light axions, which can counteract the quantum ""pressure"" induced by the
strong delocalization of the particles. In this work, we show that even a tiny
attractive interaction among ultra-light axions can have a significant impact
on the stability of cosmic structures at low redshift. After a brief review of
known results about solitons in the absence of gravity, we discuss the
stability of filamentary and pancake-like solutions when quantum pressure,
attractive interactions and gravity are present. The analysis based on one
degree of freedom, namely the breathing mode, reveals that pancakes are stable,
while filaments are unstable if the mass per unit length is larger than a
critical value. However, we show that pancakes are unstable against transverse
perturbations. We expect this to be true for halos and filaments as well.
Instabilities driven by the breathing mode will not be seen in the low column
density Lyman-$\alpha$ forest unless the axion decay constant is extremely
small, $f\lesssim 10^{13}$ GeV. Notwithstanding, axion solitonic cores could
leave a detectable signature in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest if the normalization

"1709.07955","Siqi Liu","Siqi Liu and Christos-Alexandros Psomas","On the Competition Complexity of Dynamic Mechanism Design",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Competition Complexity of an auction measures how much competition is
needed for the revenue of a simple auction to surpass the optimal revenue. A
classic result from auction theory by Bulow and Klemperer [9], states that the
Competition Complexity of VCG, in the case of n i.i.d. buyers and a single
item, is 1, i.e., it is better to recruit one extra buyer and run a second
price auction than to learn exactly the buyers' underlying distribution and run
the revenue-maximizing auction tailored to this distribution.
  In this paper we study the Competition Complexity of dynamic auctions.
Consider the following setting: a monopolist is auctioning off m items in m
consecutive stages to n interested buyers. A buyer realizes her value for item
k in the beginning of stage k. We prove that the Competition Complexity of
dynamic auctions is at most 3n, and at least linear in n, even when the buyers'
values are correlated across stages, under a monotone hazard rate assumption on
the stage (marginal) distributions. We also prove results on the number of
additional buyers necessary for VCG at every stage to be an
{\alpha}-approximation of the optimal revenue; we term this number the
{\alpha}-approximate Competition Complexity. As a corollary we provide the
first results on prior-independent dynamic auctions. This is, to the best of
our knowledge, the first non-trivial positive guarantees for simple ex-post IR
dynamic auctions for correlated stages.
  A key step towards proving bounds on the Competition Complexity is getting a
good benchmark/upper bound to the optimal revenue. To this end, we extend the
recent duality framework of Cai et al. [12] to dynamic settings. As an aside to
our approach we obtain a revenue non-monotonicity lemma for dynamic auctions,
which may be of independent interest.

opportunity to assist people with motor impairments. While several robotic
systems have explored robot-assisted dressing, few have considered how a robot

human motion can be challenging with vision-based techniques since dressing is
often intended to visually occlude the body with clothing. We present a method
to track a person's pose in real time using capacitive proximity sensing. This
sensing approach gives direct estimates of distance with low latency, has a
high signal-to-noise ratio, and has low computational requirements. Using our
method, a robot can adjust for errors in the estimated pose of a person and
physically follow the contours and movements of the person while providing
dressing assistance. As part of an evaluation of our method, the robot
successfully pulled the sleeve of a hospital gown and a cardigan onto the right
arms of 10 human participants, despite arm motions and large errors in the
initially estimated pose of the person's arm. We also show that a capacitive
sensor is unaffected by visual occlusion of the body and can sense a person's

Comparison with asymptotic giant branch models reveals that about half of the

we cannot discard that some of the objects come from more massive progenitor
stars (M > 3--4 Msun) that have suffered a mild HBB. None of the objects seem
to be a descendant of very massive progenitors. We propose that in most of the

dissociation of the CO molecule. The hypothesis of a last thermal pulse that
turns O-rich PNe into C-rich PNe is discarded, except in three objects, that
show C/O > 1. We also discuss the possibility of a He pre-enrichment to explain
the most He-enriched objects. We cannot discard other scenarios like extra

Despite that, optical spectrum of the spin noise power, as we have found, has
the characteristic shape of the homogeneously broadened line with the dip at
the line center. This fact is in stark contrast with the results of previous
studies of inhomogeneous quantum dot ensembles. In addition, the two-color

these fluctuations are either correlated, or anticorrelated depending on
whether the two wavelengths lie on the same side, or on different sides of the

is shown that the unexpected behavior of the optical Faraday rotation noise

precoding design that adaptively adjusts fronthaul compression levels and the
number of active radio-frequency (RF) chains out of the entire RF chains in a
downlink distributed massive MIMO system based on C-RAN architecture. Following
this structure, we propose an analog beamformer design in pursuit of maximizing
multi-user sum average data rate (sum-rate). Each element of the analog
beamformer is constructed based on a weighted sum of spatial channel covariance
matrices, while the size of the analog beamformer, i.e. the number of active RF
chains, is optimized so as to maximize the large-scale approximated sum-rate.
With these analog beamformer and RF chain activation, a regularized zero-

instantaneous effective channel information observed through the given analog
beamformer. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding algorithm is
validated by simulation, and its design criterion is clarified by analysis.

sidelobes compared to DAS. To improve the resolution of DMAS, a novel
beamformer is introduced using Minimum Variance (MV) adaptive beamforming
combined with DMAS, so-called Minimum Variance-Based DMAS (MVB-DMAS). It is
shown that expanding the DMAS equation results in multiple terms representing a

optimizes in polynomial time over the polytope resulting from any constant

achieve trajectory tracking in 3D space by resolving the yaw and precession

tremendous shift towards utilizing renewable energy sources (RES). In this
regard, smart grid technologies have been presented to facilitate higher
penetration of RES. Microgrids are the key components of the smart grids.
Microgrids allow integration of various distributed energy resources (DER) such
as the distributed generation (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) into the
distribution system and hence remove or delay the need for distribution
expansion. One of the crucial requirements for utilities is to ensure that the
system reliability is maintained with the inclusion of microgrid topology.
Therefore, this paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containing
prioritized loads and distributed RES through a hybrid analytical-simulation
method. The stochasticity of RES introduces complexity to the reliability
evaluation. The method takes into account the variability of RES through Monte-
Carlo state sampling simulation. The results indicate the reliability
enhancement of the overall system in the presence of the microgrid topology. In
particular, the highest priority load has the largest improvement in the
reliability indices. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to
understand the effects of the failure of microgrid islanding in the case of a

dominate the total IR energy output. However, the cold dust contribution is
still non-negligible, with the fraction of the cold dust contribution to the
total IR luminosity $(\sim 8-24\%)$ being dependent on the choice of torus
model. The derived cold dust temperatures in Hot DOGs are comparable to those
in UV bright quasars with similar IR luminosity, but much higher than those in
SMGs. Higher dust temperatures in Hot DOGs may be due to the more intense
radiation field caused by intense starburst and obscured AGN activities.
Fourteen and five submillimeter serendipitous sources in the 10 SCUBA-2 fields

  Trade-offs and Market",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conflicting problems of growing mobile service demand and
underutilization of dedicated spectrum has given rise to a paradigm where
mobile network operators (MNOs) share their infrastructure among themselves in
order to lower their operational costs, while at the same time increase the
usage of their existing network resources. We model and analyze such an
infrastructure sharing system considering a single buyer MNO and multiple
seller MNOs. Assuming that the locations of the BSs can be modeled as a
homogeneous Poisson point process, we find the downlink
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability for a user
served by the buyer MNO in an infrastructure sharing environment. We analyze
the trade-off between increasing the transmit power of a BS and the intensity
of BSs owned by the buyer MNO required to achieve a given quality-of-service
(QoS) in terms of the SINR coverage probability. Also, for a seller MNO, we
analyze the power consumption of the network per unit area (i.e., areal power
consumption) which is shown to be a piecewise continuous function of BS
intensity, composed of a linear and a convex function. Accordingly, the BS
intensity of the seller MNO can be optimized to minimize the areal power
consumption while achieving a minimum QoS for the buyer MNO. We then use these
results to formulate a single-buyer multiple-seller BS infrastructure market.
The buyer MNO is concerned with finding which seller MNO to purchase from and
what fraction of BSs to purchase. On the sellers' side, the problem of pricing
and determining the fraction of infrastructure to be sold is formulated as a
Cournot oligopoly market. We prove that the iterative update of each seller's
best response always converges to the Nash Equilibrium.

that for random propagation characterized by right-sided unimodal densities

grains are photoelectrically stripped of electrons by starlight, heating nearby
gas and possibly creating a dust clumping instability, the photoelectric
instability (PeI), that significantly alters global disk structure. In the
current work, we use the Pencil Code to perform the first numerical models of
the PeI that include stellar radiation pressure on dust grains in order to
explore the parameter regime in which the instability operates. In models with
gas surface densities greater than $\sim$$10^{-4}~\mathrm{g}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$,
we see a variety of dust structures, including sharp concentric rings and
non-axisymmetric arcs and clumps that represent dust surface density
enhancements of factors of $\sim$$5-20$ depending on the run parameters. The
gas distributions show various structures as well, including clumps and arcs
formed from spiral arms. In models with lower gas surface densities, vortices
and smooth spiral arms form in the gas distribution, but the dust is too weakly
coupled to the gas to be significantly perturbed. In one high gas surface
density model, we include a large, low-order gas viscosity, and, in agreement
with previous radiation pressure-free models, find that it observably smooths
the structures that form in the gas and dust, suggesting that resolved images
of a given disk may be useful for deriving constraints on the effective
viscosity of its gas. Broadly, our models show that radiation pressure does not
preclude the formation of complex structure from the PeI, but the qualitative
manifestation of the PeI depends strongly on the parameters of the system. The
PeI may provide an explanation for unusual disk morphologies such as the moving
blobs of the AU Mic disk, the asymmetric dust distribution of the 49 Ceti disk,
and the rings and arcs found in the disk around HD 141569A.

self-interference (SI) suppression while it may increase some cost and area
versus that with the same array. We then model the mmWave SI channel with
separate Tx/Rx arrays, where a near-field propagation model is adopted for the
line-of-sight (LOS) path, and it is found that the established LOS-SI channel
with separate Tx/Rx arrays also shows spatial sparsity. Based on the SI
channel, we further explore approaches to mitigate SI by signal processing, and
we focus on a new cancellation approach in FD-mmWave communication, i.e.,
beamforming cancellation. Centered on the constant-amplitude (CA) constraint of
the beamforming vectors, we propose several candidate solutions. Lastly, we
consider an FD-mmWave multi-user scenario, and show that even if there are no
FD users in an FD-mmWave cellular system, the FD benefit can still be exploited

the gestational age at birth noninvasively. A cross-sectional study evaluated
the skin reflectance of selected infants, preferably premature, at birth. The
first-trimester ultrasound was the reference for gestational age. A prototype
of a new noninvasive optoelectronic device measured the backscattering of light
from the skin, using a light emitting diode at wavelengths of 470 nm, 575 nm,

given an input image, and often requires to resolve visual references among the
questions. This problem is different from visual question answering (VQA),
which relies on spatial attention (a.k.a. visual grounding) estimated from an
image and question pair. We propose a novel attention mechanism that exploits
visual attentions in the past to resolve the current reference in the visual
dialog scenario. The proposed model is equipped with an associative attention
memory storing a sequence of previous (attention, key) pairs. From this memory,
the model retrieves the previous attention, taking into account recency, which
is most relevant for the current question, in order to resolve potentially
ambiguous references. The model then merges the retrieved attention with a
tentative one to obtain the final attention for the current question;
specifically, we use dynamic parameter prediction to combine the two attentions
conditioned on the question. Through extensive experiments on a new synthetic
visual dialog dataset, we show that our model significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art (by ~16 % points) in situations, where visual reference
resolution plays an important role. Moreover, the proposed model achieves
superior performance (~ 2 % points improvement) in the Visual Dialog dataset,
despite having significantly fewer parameters than the baselines.

  in True-FISP MRI sequences","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a highly mortal disease, currently assessed by
pulmonary CT angiography. True-FISP MRI has emerged as an innocuous alternative
that does not hold many of the limitations of x-ray imaging. However, True-FISP
MRI is very sensitive to turbulent blood flow, generating artifacts that may
resemble fake clots in the pulmonary vasculature. These misinterpretations
reduce its overall diagnostic accuracy to 94%, limiting a wider use in clinical
environments. A new segmentation algorithm is proposed to confirm the presence
of real pulmonary clots in True-FISP MR images by quantitative means, measuring
the shape, intensity, and solidity of the formation. The algorithm was
evaluated in 37 patients. The developed method increased the diagnostic
accuracy of expert observers assessing Pulmonary True-FISP MRI sequences by 6%
without the use of ionizing radiation, achieving a diagnostic accuracy
comparable to standard CT angiography.

very high energy gamma-ray astronomy over the next decade and beyond. The
scientific potential of CTA is extremely broad: from understanding the role of
relativistic cosmic particles to the search for dark matter. CTA is an explorer
of the extreme universe, probing environments from the immediate neighbourhood
of black holes to cosmic voids on the largest scales. Covering a huge range in
photon energy from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, CTA will improve on all aspects of
performance with respect to current instruments.
  The observatory will operate arrays on sites in both hemispheres to provide
full sky coverage and will hence maximize the potential for the rarest
phenomena such as very nearby supernovae, gamma-ray bursts or gravitational
wave transients. With 99 telescopes on the southern site and 19 telescopes on
the northern site, flexible operation will be possible, with sub-arrays
available for specific tasks. CTA will have important synergies with many of
the new generation of major astronomical and astroparticle observatories.
Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches combining CTA data with those
from other instruments will lead to a deeper understanding of the broad-band
non-thermal properties of target sources.
  The CTA Observatory will be operated as an open, proposal-driven observatory,
with all data available on a public archive after a pre-defined proprietary
period. Scientists from institutions worldwide have combined together to form
the CTA Consortium. This Consortium has prepared a proposal for a Core
Programme of highly motivated observations. The programme, encompassing
approximately 40% of the available observing time over the first ten years of
CTA operation, is made up of individual Key Science Projects (KSPs), which are
presented in this document.

$wt(X)\leq t(X)$ for any space $X$, this generalizes the well-known cardinal

Theorem 2.8 is generalized further using covers by $G_\kappa$-sets, where
$\kappa$ is a cardinal, to show that if $X$ is a power homogeneous compactum
with a countable cover of dense, countably tight subspaces then
$|X|\leq\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum. This extends a result

this paper, we propose a splitting heuristic which helps to resolve some of
these issues. The proposed integrator contains a number of unknown parameters

group velocities supported in the ring array composed of dielectric nanorods,
based on a two-dimensional model. Two sorts of trapped modes in the ring array
have been identified: the BCR trapped modes which correspond to the bound modes
below the light line at the edge of the first Brillouin zone in the
corresponding planar structure (namely the infinite linear chain); the
quasi-BIC trapped modes corresponding to the bound states in the continuum
supported in the infinite linear chain. According to the whispering gallery
condition, the BCR trapped modes can be supported in the ring array only when
the number of dielectric elements N is even, while the quasi-BIC ones always
exist no matter whether N is odd or even. For both two kind of trapped modes,
the lowest one of each kind possesses the highest Q factor, which are ~105 for
BCR kind and ~1011 for quasi-BIC kind with N=16 respectively, and the radiation
loss increases dramatically as the structural resonance increases. Finally, the
behavior of the Q factor with N is explained numerically for the lowest one of
each kind of trapped modes. The Q factor scales as Q~exp(0.662N) for the
quasi-BIC trapped mode and Q~exp(0.325N) for the BCR one. Intriguingly, the Q
factor of the quasi-BIC trapped mode can be as large as ~105 even at N=8.
Compared to the finite linear chain, the structure of ring array exhibits
overwhelming advantage in Q factor with the same N because there is no
array-edge radiation loss in the ring array. We note that the principles can
certainly be extended to particles of other shapes (such as nanospheres,
nanodisks, and many other experimentally feasible geometries).

cosmological models, or represent a challenge. Given the dependence of their
stability on host halo shape, we look into how a galaxy plane's dark matter
environment influences its longevity. An increased number of dark matter
subhalos results in increased interactions that hasten the deterioration of an
already-formed plane of satellite galaxies in spherical dark halos. The role of
total dark matter mass fraction held in subhalos in dispersing a plane of
galaxies present non trivial effects on plane longevity as well. But any
misalignments of plane inclines to major axes of flattened dark matter halos
lead to their lifetimes being reduced to < 3 Gyrs. Distributing > 40% of total
dark mass in subhalos in the overall dark matter distribution results in a
plane of satellite galaxies that is prone to change through the 5 Gyr

to more than one slicing criterion. Program specialization, parallelization and
cohesion measurement are examples of such applications. These applications can
benefit from an incremental static slicing method in which a significant extent
of the computations for slicing with respect to one criterion could be reused
for another. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental slicing of
functional programs. We first present a non-incremental version of the slicing
algorithm which does a polyvariant analysis 1 of functions. Since polyvariant
analyses tend to be costly, we compute a compact context-independent summary of
each function and then use this summary at the call sites of the function. The
construction of the function summary is non-trivial and helps in the
development of the incremental version. The incremental method, on the other
hand, consists of a one-time pre-computation step that uses the non-incremental
version to slice the program with respect to a fixed default slicing criterion
and processes the results further to a canonical form. Presented with an actual
slicing criterion, the incremental step involves a low-cost computation that
uses the results of the pre-computation to obtain the slice. We have
implemented a prototype of the slicer for a pure subset of Scheme, with pairs
and lists as the only algebraic data types. Our experiments show that the
incremental step of the slicer runs orders of magnitude faster than the
non-incremental version. We have also proved the correctness of our incremental
algorithm with respect to the non-incremental version.

incoherently. Applying the model to the transmission of Cooper pairs between

distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids (MGs) in the future power
system, known as smart grid. In this paper, a general framework for ownership
cost calculation is proposed using uncertainty and risk analyses. Four
ownership cost calculation approaches are introduced and compared based on
their associated risk values. Finally, the best method is chosen based on a
series of simulation results, performed for a typical diesel generator (DiG).
Although simulation results are given for a DiG (as commonly used in MGs), the
proposed approaches can be applied to other MG components, such as batteries,
with slight modifications, as presented in this paper. The analyses and
proposed approaches can be useful in MG optimal design, optimal power flow, and
market-based operation of the smart grid for accurate operational cost
calculations.

traffic congestion problem in an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).
Traffic congestion is one of the most serious problems in a city, which can be
predicted in advance by analyzing traffic flow patterns. Such prediction is
possible by analyzing the real-time transportation data from correlative roads
and vehicles. This article first gives a brief introduction to the
transportation data, and surveys the state-of-the-art prediction methods. Then,
we verify whether or not the prediction performance is able to be improved by
fitting actual data to optimize the parameters of the prediction model which is
used to predict the traffic flow. Such verification is conducted by comparing
the optimized time series prediction model with the normal time series
prediction model. This means that in the era of big data, accurate use of the
data becomes the focus of studying the traffic flow prediction to solve the
congestion problem. Finally, experimental results of a case study are provided
to verify the existence of such performance improvement, while the research
challenges of this data-analytics-based prediction are presented and discussed.

heteroskedasticity in unbalanced analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models.
Currently available potential remedies for such a scenario are based on
heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimation (HCCME). However,
the HCCME approach tends to be liberal in small samples. Therefore, in the
present manuscript, we propose a combination of HCCME and a wild bootstrap
technique, with the aim of improving the small-sample performance. We precisely
state a set of assumptions for the general ANCOVA model and discuss their
practical interpretation in detail, since this issue may have been somewhat
neglected in applied research so far. We prove that these assumptions are
sufficient to ensure the asymptotic validity of the combined HCCME-wild
bootstrap ANCOVA. The results of our simulation study indicate that our
proposed test remedies the problems of the ANCOVA F test and its
heteroskedasticity-consistent alternatives in small to moderate sample size
scenarios. Our test only requires very mild conditions, thus being applicable
in a broad range of real-life settings, as illustrated by the detailed
discussion of a dataset from preclinical research on spinal cord injury. Our
proposed method is ready-to-use and allows for valid hypothesis testing in
frequently encountered settings (e.g., comparing group means while adjusting

adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed. Although powerful deep neural networks
(DNNs) techniques can be applied to artificially synthesize speech waveform,
the synthetic speech quality is low compared with that of natural speech. One
of the issues causing the quality degradation is an over-smoothing effect often
observed in the generated speech parameters. A GAN introduced in this paper
consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and
generated samples, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. In the
proposed framework incorporating the GANs, the discriminator is trained to
distinguish natural and generated speech parameters, while the acoustic models
are trained to minimize the weighted sum of the conventional minimum generation
loss and an adversarial loss for deceiving the discriminator. Since the
objective of the GANs is to minimize the divergence (i.e., distribution
difference) between the natural and generated speech parameters, the proposed
method effectively alleviates the over-smoothing effect on the generated speech
parameters. We evaluated the effectiveness for text-to-speech and voice
conversion, and found that the proposed method can generate more natural
spectral parameters and $F_0$ than conventional minimum generation error
training algorithm regardless its hyper-parameter settings. Furthermore, we
investigated the effect of the divergence of various GANs, and found that a
Wasserstein GAN minimizing the Earth-Mover's distance works the best in terms
of improving synthetic speech quality.

Newton-Euler equations respectively, which give rise to a more accurate dynamic
relationship between aerial platform and manipulator. Then, the
dynamic-compensation PID control is proposed to solve the problem of

shows that the AM system presented can be fully-actued controlled with advanced

form a nanoplasma by avalanche-like electron impact ionizations even at lower
laser intensities where He is not directly field ionized, provided that the
droplets contain a few dopant atoms which provide seed electrons for the
electron impact ionization avalanche. In this theoretical paper on calcium and
xenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization
avalanches, termed ignition. We find that the partial loss of seed electrons
from the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier
for ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant
cations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric
field. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed
electrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting electron impact
ionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away.
The dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He as well as the
slingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a
dependence of the dopants' ignition capability on the dopant mass. Here, we
develop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability of
dopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the
He atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the
distribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays
between the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for
calcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by the time it takes to
deshield the dopant ions.

  Tribocharging and Tribodischarging","15 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The friction-induced charging (i.e., tribocharging) and the following
discharging (referred here as tribodischarging) are always believed to have
negative effects on the daily life and on the industrial production. Thus, how
to inhibit the tribocharging and the tribodischarging has caused wide public
concern. Because the discharge caused by the electrical breakdown of the
ambient gas is generally accompanied with the generation of light, we
investigated here the tribocharging and the tribodischarging by observing the
light emitted during friction. We found that the position reversal of the
friction pair has a dramatic impact on the intensity of the tribo-induced
light. Experimental results show that an intense light is produced when a
stationary Al2O3 disk is sliding on a rotating SiO2 disk, but only a weak light
is observed for the case of a stationary SiO2 disk and a rotating Al2O3 disk.
This means that the process of the tribocharging and the tribodischarging can
be significantly influenced owing to the change in the relative position of the
friction couple. The experimentally measured polarities of the tribo-induced
charge on the friction surfaces further indicated that the strong discharging
occurs when the rotating surface is negatively charged. The reason for the
difference in the intensity of the tribocharging and tribodischarging can be
attributed to the combined effects of the contact potential difference and the
temperature gradient between the contacting surfaces on the charge transfer
when friction. Finally, a simple, low cost, yet effective approach, i.e., just
keep the friction partner whose surface is tribo-induced negatively charged as
the stationary one, can be utilized to suppress the intensity of the
tribocharging and the tribodischarging. This work may provide potential
applications in numerous areas of science and engineering and also in the
everyday life.

regarded as the energy of a scalar field driving an inflation-like expansion of
a multiverse with ours being a subuniverse among other parallel universes. A
simple model of this multiverse is elaborated: Assuming closed space geometry,
the origin of the multiverse can be explained by quantum tunneling from
nothing; subuniverses are supposed to emerge from local fluctuations of
separate inflation fields. The standard concept of tunneling from nothing is
extended to the effect that in addition to an inflationary scalar field, matter
is also generated, and that the tunneling leads to an (unstable) equilibrium
state. The cosmological principle is assumed to pertain from the origin of the
multiverse until the first subuniverses emerge. With increasing age of the
multiverse, its spatial curvature decays exponentially so fast that, due to
sharing the same space, the flatness problem of our universe resolves by
itself. The dark energy density imprinted by the multiverse on our universe is
time-dependent, but such that the ratio $w{=}\varrho/(c^2p)$ of its mass
density and pressure (times $c^2$) is time-independent and assumes a value
$-1{+}\epsilon$ with arbitrary $\epsilon{>}0$. $\epsilon$ can be chosen so
small, that the dark energy model of this paper can be fitted to the current

text localization method for Indoor Mobile Robot Navigation is introduced. This
method is based on morphological operators and machine learning techniques and
can be used in real time environments. The proposed method has two steps. At
First, a new set of morphological operators is applied with a particular
sequence to extract high contrast areas that have high probability of text
existence. Using of morphological operators has many advantages such as: high
computation speed, being invariant to several geometrical transformations like
translation, rotations, and scaling, and being able to extract all areas
containing text. After extracting text candidate regions, a set of nine
features are extracted for accurate detection and deletion of the regions that
don't have text. These features are descriptors for texture properties and are
computed in real time. Then, we use a SVM classifier to detect the existence of
text in the region. Performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against a
number of widely used text localization algorithms and the results show that
this method can quickly and effectively localize and extract text regions from
real scenes and can be used in mobile robot navigation under an indoor

the accommodation of Mo impurities compacted in hollow sites between layers.

measurement. Because the adaptive measurement fits dataset better, in contrast
with random Gaussian measurement matrix, under the same measuremen- t rate, it
can extract the information of scene more efficiently and get better
reconstruction results. Experiments show that the new network outperforms the
original one.

collections of data are important for many applications. One way to construct
these embeddings is to acquire estimates of similarity from the crowd. However,
similarity is a multi-dimensional concept that varies from individual to
individual. Existing models for learning embeddings from the crowd typically
make simplifying assumptions such as all individuals estimate similarity using
the same criteria, the list of criteria is known in advance, or that the crowd
workers are not influenced by the data that they see. To overcome these
limitations we introduce Context Embedding Networks (CENs). In addition to
learning interpretable embeddings from images, CENs also model worker biases
for different attributes along with the visual context i.e. the visual
attributes highlighted by a set of images. Experiments on two noisy crowd
annotated datasets show that modeling both worker bias and visual context
results in more interpretable embeddings compared to existing approaches.
