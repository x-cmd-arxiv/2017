with the identification of nominal and anomalous behavior. Event detection is
increasingly relevant in robotics as robots operate with greater autonomy in
increasingly unstructured environments. In this work, we present an accurate,
robust, fast, and versatile measure for skill and anomaly identification. A
theoretical proof establishes the link between the derivative of the
log-likelihood of the HMM filtered belief state and the latest emission
probabilities. The key insight is the inverse relationship in which gradient
analysis is used for skill and anomaly identification. Our measure showed
better performance across all metrics than related state-of-the art works. The
result is broadly applicable to domains that use HMMs for event detection.

group invariance, is designed to obtain a scale-fixed and scheme-independent

we transform the usual $\overline{\rm MS}$ pQCD series into the one under the
minimal momentum space subtraction scheme. To compare with the prediction under
conventional scale setting, $R_{\rm{Conv,mMOM}-r}=
\left(4.12^{+0.30}_{-0.28}\right)\times10^3$, after applying the PMC, we obtain
$R_{\rm PMC,mMOM-r}=\left(6.09^{+0.62}_{-0.55}\right) \times10^3$, where the
errors are squared averages of the ones caused by $m_c$ and $\Lambda_{\rm
mMOM}$. The PMC prediction agrees with the recent PDG value within errors, i.e.
$R^{\rm exp}=\left(6.3\pm0.5\right)\times10^3$. Thus we think the mismatching

misfits in the micro-structure, driven by plastic deformations, thermal or

from the dynamic remodelling processes aiming at optimizing the overall
structural response to environmental physical forces. From a mechanical
viewpoint, residual stresses are classically modelled through the introduction
of a virtual incompatible state that collects the local relaxed states around
each material point. In this work, we instead employ an alternative approach
based on a strain energy function that constitutively depends only on the
deformation gradient and the residual stress tensor. In particular, our
objective is to study the morphological stability of an incompressible sphere,
made of a neo-Hookean material and subjected to given distributions of residual
stresses. Firstly, we perform a linear stability analysis on the pre-stressed
solid sphere using the method of incremental deformations. The marginal
stability conditions are given as a function of a control parameter, being the
dimensionless variable that represents the characteristic intensity of the
residual stresses. Secondly, we perform finite element simulations using a
mixed formulation in order to investigate the post-buckling morphology in the
fully nonlinear regime. Considering different distributions of the residual
stresses, we find that different morphological transitions occur around the
material domain where the hoop residual stress reaches its maximum compressive
value. The results provide useful guidelines in order to design morphable soft
spheres, for example by controlling the residual stresses through active
deformations. They finally suggest a viable solution for the nondestructive
characterization of residual stresses in soft tissues, such as solid tumors.

Analysis of their orbital dynamics may reveal invaluable information about the
physical properties of the participating stars. Unfortunately, there are only a
few known and well described multiple systems, this is even more so for systems
located outside the Milky Way galaxy. A particularly interesting situation
occurs when the inner binary in a compact triple system is eclipsing. This is
because the stellar interaction, typically resulting in precession of orbital
planes, may be observable as a variation of depth of the eclipses on a long
timescale. Aims: We aim to present a novel method to determine compact triples
using publicly available photometric data from large surveys. Here we apply it
to eclipsing binaries (EBs) in Magellanic Clouds from OGLE III database.
Methods: We analyzed light curves (LCs) of 26121 LMC and 6138 SMC EBs with the
goal to identify those for which the orbital inclination varies in time.
Archival LCs of the selected systems, when complemented by our own observations
with Danish 1.54m telescope, were thoroughly analyzed using the PHOEBE program.
Time dependence of the EB's inclination was described using the theory of
orbital-plane precession. By observing the parameter-dependence of the
precession rate, we were able to constrain the third companion mass and its
orbital period around EB. Results: We identified 58 candidates of new compact

protocols. However, the majority of routers on the Internet are closed-source.
Hence, there is no straightforward way to analyze them. Specifically, one
cannot easily identify deviations of a router's routing functionality from the
routing protocol's standard. Such deviations (either deliberate or inadvertent)
are particularly important to identify since they may degrade the security or
resiliency of the network.
  A model-based testing procedure is a technique that allows to systematically
generate tests based on a model of the system to be tested; thereby finding
deviations in the system compared to the model. However, applying such an
approach to a complex multi-party routing protocol requires a prohibitively
high number of tests to cover the desired functionality. We propose efficient
and practical optimizations to the model-based testing procedure that are
tailored to the analysis of routing protocols. These optimizations allow to
devise a formal black-box method to unearth deviations in closed-source routing
protocols' implementations. The method relies only on the ability to test the
targeted protocol implementation and observe its output. Identification of the
deviations is fully automatic.
  We evaluate our method against one of the complex and widely used routing
protocols on the Internet -- OSPF. We search for deviations in the OSPF
implementation of Cisco. Our evaluation identified numerous significant
deviations that can be abused to compromise the security of a network. The
deviations were confirmed by Cisco. We further employed our method to analyze

significant deviation. Subsequent to the disclosure of the deviations some of

invariant to various environmental challenges such as seasonal changes and
variations due to ambient lighting conditions during day and night. Moreover, a
practical VPR system necessitates compact representations of environmental
features. To satisfy these requirements, in this paper we suggest a
modification to the existing pipeline of VPR systems to incorporate supervised
hashing. The modified system learns (in a supervised setting) compact binary
codes from image feature descriptors. These binary codes imbibe robustness to
the visual variations exposed to it during the training phase, thereby, making
the system adaptive to severe environmental changes. Also, incorporating
supervised hashing makes VPR computationally more efficient and easy to
implement on simple hardware. This is because binary embeddings can be learned
over simple-to-compute features and the distance computation is also in the
low-dimensional hamming space of binary codes. We have performed experiments on
several challenging data sets covering seasonal, illumination and viewpoint
variations. We also compare two widely used supervised hashing methods of
CCAITQ and MLH and show that this new pipeline out-performs or closely matches
the state-of-the-art deep learning VPR methods that are based on
high-dimensional features extracted from pre-trained deep convolutional neural

to a much faster power-law subdiffusion (with a logarithmic correction) as it

we apply scanning transmission electron microscopy to investigate the atomic

orthorhombic/orthorhombic domain walls and coherent orthorhombic/monoclinic

how interphase boundaries can impose strain conditions that may be key to phase
stabilization. Moreover, the atomic structure near interphase boundary walls

occur in perovskite morphotropic phase boundary systems by mechanisms similar

decades. The problem is to dynamically schedule multi-type tasks to
multi-skilled servers such that the resulting queueing system is both stable in
the capacity region (throughput optimality) and the mean delay of tasks is
minimized at high loads near the boundary of the capacity region (heavy-traffic
optimality). As for applications, data-intensive analytics like MapReduce,
Hadoop, and Dryad fit into this setting, where the set of servers is
heterogeneous for different task types, so the pair of task type and server
determines the processing rate of the task. The load balancing algorithm used
in such frameworks is an example of affinity scheduling which is desired to be
both robust and delay optimal at high loads when hot-spots occur. Fluid model
planning, the MaxWeight algorithm, and the generalized $c\mu$-rule are among
the first algorithms proposed for affinity scheduling that have theoretical
guarantees on being optimal in different senses, which will be discussed in the
related work section. All these algorithms are not practical for use in data
center applications because of their non-realistic assumptions. The
join-the-shortest-queue-MaxWeight (JSQ-MaxWeight), JSQ-Priority, and

systems with two and three levels of data locality with a rack structure. In
this work, we propose the Generalized-Balanced-Pandas algorithm (GB-PANDAS) for
a system with multiple levels of data locality and prove its throughput
optimality. We prove this result under an arbitrary distribution for service
times, whereas most previous theoretical work assumes geometric distribution
for service times. The extensive simulation results show that the GB-PANDAS
algorithm alleviates the mean delay and has a better performance than the

longitudinal optical (LO) modes make the role LO-plasmon coupling crucial for
transport. The electron density dependence of the electron mobility in
\beta-Ga2O3 is studied in bulk material form and also in the form of
two-dimensional electron gas. Under high electron density a bulk mobility of
182 cm2/ V.s is predicted while in 2DEG form the corresponding mobility is
about 418 cm2/V.s when remote impurities are present at the interface and
improves further as the remote impurity center moves away from the interface.
The trend of the electron mobility shows promise for realizing high electron

approximations of the belief, hence enables tracking complex state

of the approaches to alleviate this problem by transferring data from data-rich
source domain to data-scarce target domain. Existing transfer learning methods
typically perform one-shot transfer learning and often ignore the specific

better narrow the gap between the target domain and the source domain for
effective transfer of the data from the source domain to target domain.

non-reciprocal devices obtained by pairing two single-ended (SE) circulators,
each consisting of three first-order bandpass or bandstop LC filters, connected
in either a wye or a delta topology. The resonant poles of each SE circulator
are modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting in
synthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatiotemporal modulation
(STM). We tailor the two SE circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phase
difference between their STM biases. Unlike conventional differential
time-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, we
show that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (IM)
products, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits
for an external observer. In turn, this property enhances all metrics of the
resulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of SE architectures, and
improving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. We
show that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes the
required modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude. We develop a
rigorous small-signal model to guide the design of the proposed circuits and to
get insights into their pseudo-LTI characteristics. Then, we validate the
theory with simulations and measurements showing remarkable performance
compared to the current state of the art of magnetless non-reciprocal devices.

radio continuum emission during solar flares. Although studied for many
decades, its physical exciter, emission mechanism, and association with the
flare energy release remain unclear, partly due to the lack of simultaneous
imaging observations. We report the first dynamic spectroscopic imaging
observations of decimetric fiber bursts, which occurred during the rise phase
of a long-duration eruptive flare on 2012 March 3, as obtained by the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array in 1--2 GHz. Our results show that the fiber sources
are located near and above one footpoint of the flare loops. The fiber source
and the background continuum source are found to be cospatial and share the
same morphology. It is likely that they are associated with nonthermal
electrons trapped in the converging magnetic fields near the footpoint, as
supported by a persistent coronal hard X-ray source present during the flare
rise phase. We analyze three groups of fiber bursts in detail with dynamic
imaging spectroscopy and obtain their mean frequency-dependent centroid
trajectories in projection. By using a barometric density model and magnetic
field based on a potential-field extrapolation, we further reconstruct the 3-D
source trajectories of fiber bursts, for comparison with expectations from the
whistler wave model and two MHD-based models. We conclude that the observed
fiber burst properties are consistent with an exciter moving at the propagation

show that it is impossible to devise a user association scheme that maximizes

tradeoff between the coverage and link rate in mmWave HetNets with distinct

form their opinions relying on the opinions of their neighbors. According to
DeGroot opinion formation model, one value of particular importance is the
asymptotic consensus value---the sum of user opinions weighted by the users'
eigenvector centralities. This value plays the role of an attractor for the
opinions in the network and is a lucrative target for external influence.
However, since any potentially malicious control of the opinion distribution in
a social network is clearly undesirable, it is important to design methods to
prevent the external attempts to strategically change the asymptotic consensus
value.
  In this work, we assume that the adversary wants to maximize the asymptotic
consensus value by altering the opinions of some users in a network; we, then,
state DIVER---an NP-hard problem of disabling such external influence attempts
by strategically adding a limited number of edges to the network. Relying on
the theory of Markov chains, we provide perturbation analysis that shows how
eigenvector centrality and, hence, DIVER's objective function change in
response to an edge's addition to the network. The latter leads to the design
of a pseudo-linear-time heuristic for DIVER, whose computation relies on
efficient estimation of mean first passage times in a Markov chain. We confirm
our theoretical findings in experiments.

explore recently proposed weight normalization algorithms (WN algorithms), i.e.
weight normalization, normalization propagation and weight normalization with

experimentally shown to outperform BN on relatively small networks and
datasets. However, it is not clear if these algorithms could replace BN in
practical, large-scale applications. We answer this question by providing a
detailed comparison of BN and WN algorithms using ResNet-50 network trained on
ImageNet. We found that although WN achieves better training accuracy, the
final test accuracy is significantly lower ($\approx 6\%$) than that of BN.
This result demonstrates the surprising strength of the BN regularization
effect which we were unable to compensate for using standard regularization
techniques like dropout and weight decay. We also found that training of deep
networks with WN algorithms is significantly less stable compared to BN,

feasible, topologically interpretable data structures, in terms of birth and
death of homology classes, for persistent homology with multiple real
parameters. To replace the noetherian hypothesis in the general setting of
modules over posets, a ""finitely encoded"" condition is defined combinatorially
and developed algebraically. It captures topological tameness of persistent
homology. Poset-modules satisfying it can be specified by ""fringe
presentations"" that reflect birth-and-death descriptions of persistence. A
syzygy theorem characterizes finitely encoded modules as admitting
appropriately finite presentations and resolutions.
  The geometric and algebraic theory focuses on modules over real polyhedral
groups (real vector spaces with polyhedral positive cones) and a parallel
theory over discrete polyhedral groups (abelian groups with finitely generated
positive cones). Existence of primary decomposition is proved over arbitrary
polyhedral partially ordered abelian groups, but the real and discrete cases
carry enough geometry and, crucially in the real case, topology to induce
complete theories of minimal primary and secondary decomposition, associated
and attached faces, minimal generators and cogenerators, socles and tops,
minimal upset covers and downset hulls, Matlis duality, and minimal fringe
presentation. Real semialgebraic properties of data are preserved by functorial
constructions.
  Tops and socles become functorial birth and death spaces for multiparameter
persistence modules. They yield functorial ""QR codes"" and ""elder morphisms"" for
modules over real and discrete polyhedral groups that generalize and categorify
the bar code and elder rule for persistent homology in one parameter. The
disparate ways that QR codes and elder morphisms model bar codes coalesce, in
one parameter, to functorial bar codes.

most outstanding open problems of extremal combinatorics. Perhaps the main
bottleneck for achieving this goal is that triangle-free graphs can be highly
unstructured. For example, triangle-free graphs might have only regular
partitions (in the sense of Szemer\'edi) of tower-type size. And indeed,
essentially all the graph properties ${\cal P}$ for which removal lemmas with
reasonable bounds were obtained, are such that every graph satisfying ${\cal
P}$ has a small regular partition. So in some sense, a barrier for obtaining an
efficient removal lemma for property ${\cal P}$ was having an efficient
regularity lemma for graphs satisfying ${\cal P}$.
  In this paper we consider the property of being induced $C_4$-free, which
also suffers from the fact that a graph might satisfy this property but still
have only regular partitions of tower-type size. By developing a new approach
for this problem we manage to overcome this barrier and thus obtain a merely
exponential bound for the induced $C_4$ removal lemma. We thus obtain the first
efficient removal lemma that does not rely on an efficient version of the
regularity lemma. This is the first substantial progress on a problem raised by
Alon in 2001, and more recently by Alon, Conlon and Fox.

Instead, weak answers to security questions (i.e. low entropy) are easy to

short-term plasticity can provide spiking networks with distinct computational
advantages compared to their classical counterparts. In this work, we use
networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that are trained to perform both
discriminative and generative tasks in their forward and backward information
processing paths, respectively. During training, the energy landscape
associated with their dynamics becomes highly diverse, with deep attractor
basins separated by high barriers. Classical algorithms solve this problem by
employing various tempering techniques, which are both computationally
demanding and require global state updates. We demonstrate how similar results
can be achieved in spiking networks endowed with local short-term synaptic
plasticity. Additionally, we discuss how these networks can even outperform
tempering-based approaches when the training data is imbalanced. We thereby
show how biologically inspired, local, spike-triggered synaptic dynamics based
simply on a limited pool of synaptic resources can allow spiking networks to

known that merely assigning values to the divergent integrals leads to missing
terms. This problem of missing terms was earlier resolved in the complex plane,
which required the divergent integrals to assume values equal to their finite
parts under a set of rules or calculus governing the use of the finite part
integral [E.A. Galapon, {\it Proc. Roy. Soc. A} {\bf 473}, 20160567 (2017)].
However, divergent integrals assume a spectrum of values arising from the
different ways of removing the divergences in the integration. Here we show
that the other interpretations of divergent integrals follow the same set of
rules as those of the finite part integral, and then formulate the calculus of
divergent integrals arising from term-by-term integration. We find that the
calculus does not prescribe a specific interpretation to the divergent
integrals but allows us to assign arbitrary values to them, with the missing
terms automatically emerging from the chosen interpretation of the divergent
integrals itself.

  Recently, \v{S}upina proved that I is not a weak P-ideal if and only if any
topological space is an IQN-space. Moreover, under $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{c}$
he constructed a maximal ideal I (which is not a weak P-ideal) for which the
notions of IQN-space and QN-space do not coincide. In this paper we show that,
consistently, there is an ideal I (which is not a weak P-ideal) for which the
notions of IwQN-space and wQN-space do not coincide. We also prove that for
this ideal the ideal version of Scheepers Conjecture does not hold (this is the
first known example of such weak P-ideal).
  We obtain a strictly combinatorial characterization of ${\tt

${\tt non}(\text{IQN-space})$. We calculate ${\tt non}(\text{IQN-space})$ and
${\tt non}(\text{IwQN-space})$ for some weak P-ideals. Namely, we show that
$\mathfrak{b}\leq{\tt non}(\text{IQN-space})\leq{\tt
non}(\text{IwQN-space})\leq\mathfrak{d}$ for every weak P-ideal I and that
${\tt non}(\text{IQN-space})={\tt non}(\text{IwQN-space})=\mathfrak{b}$ for
every $\mathtt{F_\sigma}$ ideal I as well as for every analytic P-ideal I
generated by an unbounded submeasure (this establishes some new bounds for
$\mathfrak{b}(I,I,Fin)$). As a consequence, we obtain some bounds for ${\tt
add}(\text{IQN-space})$. In particular, we get ${\tt
add}(\text{IQN-space})=\mathfrak{b}$ for analytic P-ideals I generated by an
unbounded submeasure.
  By a result of Bukovsk\'y, Das and \v{S}upina it is known that in the case of
tall ideals I the notions of IQN-space (IwQN-space) and QN-space (wQN-space)
cannot be distinguished. We prove that if I is a tall ideal and X is a

soft colloids and hard spheres, despite the apparent complexity of the

particle physics, we discuss some basic aspects of chiral anomaly which may
help deepen our understanding of chiral anomaly in particle physics also. It is
first shown that Berry's phase (and its generalization) for the Weyl model $H
=v_{F} \vec{\sigma}\cdot \vec{p}(t)$ assumes a monopole form at the exact
adiabatic limit but deviates from it off the adiabatic limit and vanishes in
the high frequency limit of the Fourier transform of $\vec{p}(t)$ for bounded
$|\vec{p}(t)|$. An effective action, which is consistent with the non-adiabatic
limit of Berry's phase, combined with the Bjorken-Johnson-Low prescription
gives normal equal-time space-time commutators and no chiral anomaly. In
contrast, an effective action with a monopole at the origin of the momentum
space, which describes Berry's phase in the precise adiabatic limit but fails
off the adiabatic limit, gives anomalous space-time commutators and a covariant
anomaly to the gauge current. We regard this anomaly as an artifact of the
postulated monopole and not a consequence of Berry's phase. As for the recent
application of the chiral anomaly to the description of effective Weyl fermions
in condensed matter and nuclear physics, which is closely related to the
formulation of lattice chiral fermions, we point out that the chiral anomaly
for each species doubler separately vanishes for a finite lattice spacing,
contrary to the common assumption. Instead a general form of pair creation
associated with the spectral flow for the Dirac sea with finite depth takes
place. This view is supported by the Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, which defines a
single Weyl fermion without doublers on the lattice and gives a well-defined
index (anomaly) even for a finite lattice spacing.

implementation of denoising spatial filter. The mean or median spatial filters
with fixed window shape are known for its denoising ability, however, have the
drawback of blurring the object edges. The effect of blurring increases with an
increase in window size. To preserve the edge information, we propose an
adaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels and
calculates the mean. The analog input differences of neighborhood pixels are
converted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and applied
as neuron input. When the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greater
level than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified as
similar. The sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in the
serial-in-parallel-out shift register. The outputs of shift registers are used
as input to the selector switches of an averaging circuit making this an
adaptive mean operation resulting in an edge preserving mean filter. System
level simulation of the hardware is conducted using 150 images from Caltech
database with added Gaussian noise to test the robustness of edge-preserving
and denoising ability of the proposed filter. Threshold values of the hardware
neuron were adjusted so that the proposed edge-preserving spatial filter
achieves optimal performance in terms of PSNR and MSE, and these results
outperforms that of the conventional mean and median filters.

models is an important and popular way to constrain the physical parameters

previous works suggest that both blue-bands and red-bands photometry works for
the SED-fitting. Either blue-domained or red-domained SED-fitting usually lead
to the unreliable or biased results. Meanwhile, it seems that extending the
wavelength coverage could be helpful. Since the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ({\it
GALEX}) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) provide the FUV/NUV and
mid-infrared $W1$/$W2$ band data, we extend the SED-fitting to a wider
wavelength coverage. In our work, we analyzed the effect of adding the FUV/NUV
and $W1$/$W2$ band to the optical and near-infrared $UBVRIJHK$ bands for the
fitting with the Bruzual \& Charlot 2003 (BC03) models and {\sc galev} models.
It is found that the FUV/NUV bands data affect the fitting results of both ages
and metallicities much more significantly than that of the WISE $W1$/$W2$ band
with the BC03 models. While for the {\sc galev} models, the effect of the WISE
$W1$/$W2$ band for the metallicity fitting seems comparable to that of {\it

crucial than that of the FUV/NUV bands. Thus we conclude that the {\it GALEX}

of further characterizing the transit behavior of the dusty debris clouds
orbiting this white dwarf. The optical observations were carried out with a
small ground-based telescope run by an amateur astronomer, and covered 53
different nights over the 8-month interval. We have found that the optical
activity has increased to the highest level observed since its discovery with
Kepler K2, with approximately 17% of the optical flux extinguished per orbit.
The source exhibits some transits with depths of up to 55% and durations as
long as two hours. The dominant period of the orbiting dust clouds during
2016-2017 is 4.49126 hours. We present 'waterfall' images for the entire
2016-2017 and 2015-2016 observing seasons. In addition, the white dwarf was
observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory for 10-ksec on each of four
different occasions, separated by about a month each. The upper limit on the
average X-ray flux from WD 1145+017 is ~5 x 10^{-15} ergs/cm^2/s (unabsorbed
over the range 0.1-100 keV), which translates to an upper limit on the X-ray
luminosity, Lx, of ~2 x 10^{28} ergs/s. If Lx = G Mwd Mdot/Rwd, where Mwd and
Rwd are the mass and radius of the white dwarf, and Mdot is the accretion rate,
then Mdot < 2 x 10^{11} g/s. This is just consistent with the value of Mdot
that is inferred from the level of dust activity.

with resolving power R near 40 000. An analytical framework is presented for
bulk Earth composition material falling onto the magnetic polar regions of
white dwarfs, where X-rays and cyclotron radiation may contribute to accretion

any signal processing (SP) method. In particular, the common problem of
estimating the value of a vector of parameters from a set of noisy measurements
is at the core of a plethora of scientific and technological advances in the
last decades; for example, wireless communications, radar and sonar,
biomedicine, image processing, and seismology, just to name a few. Developing
an estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the
measured data, i.e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct,
fully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements.
Experience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any
assumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present.
Consequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the
estimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be
mismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance
loss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model
misspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further,
understanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model
misspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and
practical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of
this paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on
estimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model
misspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical
literature in the last fifty years. Secondly, some applications are discussed
to illustrate the broad range of areas and problems to which this framework
extends, and consequently the numerous opportunities available for SP
researchers.

Chevalley derivative, curvature and the Bianchi identity for the possible

a volatile stock asset than a currency and that changes in its price are
influenced by sentiment about the BitCoin system itself; in Kristoufek [10] the
author analyses transaction based as well as popularity based potential drivers
of the BitCoin price finding positive evidence. Here, we endorse this finding
and consider a bivariate model in continuous time to describe the price
dynamics of one BitCoin as well as a second factor, affecting the price itself,
which represents a sentiment indicator. We prove that the suggested model is
arbitrage-free under a mild condition and, based on risk-neutral evaluation, we
obtain a closed formula to approximate the price of European style derivatives
on the BitCoin. By applying the same approximation technique to the joint
likelihood of a discrete sample of the bivariate process, we are also able to
fit the model to market data. This is done by using both the Volume and the
number of Google searches as possible proxies for the sentiment factor.
Further, the performance of the pricing formula is assessed on a sample of
market option prices obtained by the website deribit.com.

pictures and cues, which previous psychology research found to be crucial to
aid memorability. This game asks users to pick the word that relates to the
given pictures. We then customized this game by adding features which help
maximize the following memory retrieval skills: (a) verbal cues - by providing
hints with verbal descriptions, (b) spatial cues - by maintaining the same

(d) interactivity/engaging nature of the game.

applications in machine translation, dialogue systems, image captioning, etc.
Recently, by combining with policy gradient, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)
that use a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model
as a reinforcement learning policy has shown promising results in text
generation. However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the
entire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text
structure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when
the length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this
paper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for
long text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own
high-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the
guidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all
generation steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the
extracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to
guide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on
synthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that
LeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the
performance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any
supervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only
through the interaction between Manager and Worker.

  contrast imaging applications","10 pages, 5 figures, Position Sensitive Detectors 11 conference",,,,"physics.med-ph physics.app-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Edge illumination (EI) is a non-interferometric X-ray phase contrast imaging
(XPCI) method that has been successfully implemented with conventional
polychromatic sources, thanks to its relaxed coherence requirements. Like other
XPCI methods, EI enables the retrieval of absorption, refraction and
ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) signals. However, current retrieval
algorithms require three input frames, which have so far been acquired under as
many different illumination conditions, in separate exposures. These
illumination conditions can be achieved by deliberately misaligning the set-up
in different ways. Each one of these misaligned configurations can then be used
to record frames containing a mixture of the absorption, refraction and
scattering signals. However, this acquisition scheme involves lengthy exposure
times, which can also introduce errors to the retrieved signals. Such errors
have, so far, been mitigated by careful image acquisition and analysis.
However, further reduction to image acquisition time and errors due to sample
mask/sample movement can increase the advantages offered by the EI technique,
and enable targeting more challenging applications. In this paper, we describe
two simplified set-ups that exploit state-of-the-art detector technologies to
achieve single-shot multi-modal imaging.

display. Currently, freeform optics and waveguides are used to design near-eye
visors, but these structures are complex and their field of view is limited
when the visor is placed near the eye. In this paper, we propose a flat,
freeform near-eye visor which uses a sub-wavelength patterned metasurface
reflector. The visor design imparts a spatial phase profile on a projected
display pattern and can be implemented using a micron-scale thick metasurface.
As the resulting metaform visor relies on diffraction, it can preserve a large
field of view (77.3{\deg} both horizontally and vertically) when placed only
2.5 cm away from the eye. We simulate the metasurface visor to estimate the
modulation transfer function, and find that the projected image quality is
sufficiently high for human vision. While the design of the metasurface is
initially performed via ray optics, using full-wave finite-difference
time-domain simulation we validate a scaled version of our visor design.
