arrangements, we derive a polynomial time, complete algorithm that produces
solutions with constant-factor optimality guarantees on both makespan and
distance optimality, in expectation, under the assumption that the robot labels
are uniformly randomly distributed. Our algorithm only requires a small
constant factor expansion of the initial and goal configuration footprints for
solving the problem, i.e., the problem can be solved in a fairly small bounded
region. Beside theoretical guarantees, we present a thorough computational
evaluation of the proposed solution. In addition to the baseline
implementation, adapting an effective (but non-polynomial time) routing
subroutine, we also provide a highly efficient implementation that quickly
computes near-optimal solutions. Hardware experiments on the microMVP platform
composed of non-holonomic robots confirms the practical applicability of our
algorithmic pipeline.

  Repair Bandwidth","Significant overlap with arXiv:1608.00191",,,,"cs.IT cs.CC math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of constructing MDS codes that enable exact
repair of each code block with small repair bandwidth, which refers to the
total amount of information flow from the remaining code blocks during the
repair process. This problem naturally arises in the context of distributed
storage systems as the node repair problem [7]. The constructions of
exact-repairable MDS codes with optimal repair-bandwidth require working with
large sub-packetization levels, which restricts their employment in practice.
  This paper presents constructions for MDS codes that simultaneously provide
both small repair bandwidth and small sub-packetization level. In particular,
this paper presents two general approaches to construct exact-repairable MDS
codes that aim at significantly reducing the required sub-packetization level
at the cost of slightly sub-optimal repair bandwidth. The first approach gives
MDS codes that have repair bandwidth at most twice the optimal
repair-bandwidth. Additionally, these codes also have the smallest possible
sub-packetization level $\ell = O(r)$, where $r$ denotes the number of parity
blocks. This approach is then generalized to design codes that have their
repair bandwidth approaching the optimal repair-bandwidth at the cost of
graceful increment in the required sub-packetization level. The second approach
transforms an MDS code with optimal repair-bandwidth and large
sub-packetization level into a longer MDS code with small sub-packetization
level and near-optimal repair bandwidth. For a given $r$, the obtained codes
have their sub-packetization level scaling logarithmically with the code
length. In addition, the obtained codes require field size only linear in the
code length and ensure load balancing among the intact code blocks in terms of
the information downloaded from these blocks during the exact reconstruction of
a code block.

in the spatial correlations of the dislocation patterns, which mediate the

are described in free text. The user model is generated by soliciting from a
user a few keywords and expanding those keywords into a list of weighted
near-synonyms. The item feature-vectors are generated from the textual
descriptions of the items, using modified tf-idf values of the users' keywords
and their near-synonyms. Once the users are modeled and the items are
abstracted into feature vectors, the system returns the maximum-similarity
items as recommendations to that user. Our experimental evaluation shows that
our method of creating the user models and item feature-vectors resulted in
higher precision and accuracy in comparison to well-known
feature-vector-generating methods like Glove and Word2Vec. It also shows that
stemming and the use of a modified version of tf-idf increase the accuracy and
precision by 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to non-stemming and the standard
tf-idf definition. Moreover, the evaluation results show that updating the user
model from usage histories improves the precision and accuracy of the system.

to a Frenet null frame by a gauge transformation that belongs to the little
group contained in the Lorentz group $SO(2,1)$ and provides an analog of the
Hasimoto transformation (relating a parallel frame to a Frenet frame for curves
in Euclidean space). The Cartan structure equations of the transformed frame
are shown to encode a hereditary recursion operator giving a two-component
generalization of the recursion operator of Burgers equation, as well as a
generalization of the Cole-Hopf transformation. Three different hierarchies of
integrable systems are obtained from the various symmetries of this recursion
operator. The first hierarchy contains two-component Burgers-type and nonlinear
Airy-type systems; the second hierarchy contains novel quasilinear
Schr\""odinger-type (NLS) systems; and the third hierarchy contains semilinear
wave equations (in two-component system form). Each of these integrable systems
is shown to correspond to a geometrical flow of a family of elastic null curves
in three-dimensional Minkowski space.

predominately ferromagnetic, whereas it turns more antiferromagnetic with
growing $k_F$. It is remarkable that even though $k_F$ varies vastly among the
rare-earth systems, an overwhelming majority of lanthanide magnets are in fact

up the possibility of a different approach to model selection in model-based

necessarily disjoint) union of complete bipartite subgraphs $G=\cup_{i=1}^s
A_i\times B_i$ where $A_i\subset P, B_i\subset Q$ for $i=1,\dots, s$. In this
paper we prove that if $G$ is \emph{semi-algebraic}, i.e. when $P$ is a set of
$m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{d_1}$, $Q$ is a set of $n$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ and the edges are defined by some semi-algebraic relations,
the representation complexity of $G$ is $O(

Apfelbaum-Sharir and Solomon-Sharir. As a consequence, when $G$ is
$K_{u,u}$-free for some positive integer $u$, its number of edges is $O(u

Suk and Zahl when the first term dominates and $u$ grows with $m,n$. Another
consequence is that we can find a large complete bipartite subgraph in a
semi-algebraic graph when the number of edges is large. Similar results hold

integer index set $\mathbf{Z}$. A group system $A$ is a set of sequences with
components in $A^t$ that forms a group under componentwise addition in $A^t$,
for each $t\in\mathbf{Z}$. In the setting of group systems, a natural
definition of a linear system is a homomorphism from a group of inputs to an
output group system $A$. We show that any group can be the input group of a
linear system and some group system. In general the kernel of the homomorphism
is nontrivial. We show that any $\ell$-controllable complete group system $A$
is a linear system whose input group is a generator group
$({\mathcal{U}},\circ)$, deduced from $A$, and then the kernel is always
trivial. The input set ${\mathcal{U}}$ is a set of tensors, a double Cartesian
product space of sets $R_{0,k}^t$, with indices $k$, for $0\le k\le\ell$, and
time $t$, for $t\in\mathbf{Z}$. $R_{0,k}^t$ is a set of unique generator labels
for the generators in $A$ with nontrivial span for the time interval $[t,t+k]$.
We show the generator group contains an elementary system, an infinite
collection of elementary groups, one for each $k$ and $t$, defined on small
subsets of ${\mathcal{U}}$, in the shape of triangles, which form a tile like
structure over ${\mathcal{U}}$. There is a homomorphism from each elementary
group to any elementary group defined on smaller tiles of the former group. Any
elementary system is sufficient to define a unique generator group up to
isomorphism, and therefore is sufficient to construct a linear system and group
system as well. Any linear block code is a strongly controllable group system.
Then we can obtain new results on the structure of block codes using the
generator group. There is a harmonic theory of group systems which we study
using the generator group.

focus on downlink transmission, where the base station (BS) employs a large
antenna array with low-cost 1-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The
direct combination of existing beamforming schemes with 1-bit DACs is shown to
lead to an error floor at medium-to-high SNR regime, due to the coarse
quantization of the DACs with limited precision. In this paper, based on the
constructive interference we consider both a quantized linear beamforming
scheme where we analytically obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, and a
non-linear mapping scheme where we directly design the transmit signal vector.
Due to the 1-bit quantization, the formulated optimization for the non-linear
mapping scheme is shown to be non-convex. To solve this problem, the non-convex
constraints of the 1-bit DACs are firstly relaxed, followed by an element-wise
normalization to satisfy the 1-bit DAC transmission. We further propose a
low-complexity symbol scaling scheme that consists of three stages, in which
the quantized transmit signal on each antenna element is selected sequentially.
Numerical results show that the proposed symbol scaling scheme achieves a
comparable performance to the optimization-based non-linear mapping approach,
while its corresponding complexity is negligible compared to that of the
non-linear scheme.

effects. The current focus on personalized medicine and effect heterogeneity
makes this task even more challenging. Towards this end, structural nested mean
models (SNMMs) are fundamental tools for studying heterogeneous treatment
effects in longitudinal studies. However, when outcomes are binary, current
methods for estimating multiplicative and additive SNMM parameters suffer from
variation dependence between the causal parameters and the non-causal nuisance
parameters. This leads to a series of difficulties in interpretation,
estimation and computation. These difficulties have hindered the uptake of
SNMMs in biomedical practice, where binary outcomes are very common. We solve
the variation dependence problem for the binary multiplicative SNMM via a
reparametrization of the non-causal nuisance parameters. Our novel nuisance
parameters are variation independent of the causal parameters, and hence allow
for coherent modeling of heterogeneous effects from longitudinal studies with
binary outcomes. Our parametrization also provides a key building block for
flexible doubly robust estimation of the causal parameters. Along the way, we
prove that an additive SNMM with binary outcomes does not admit a variation
independent parametrization, thereby justifying the restriction to
multiplicative SNMMs.

the secondary-to-primary silicon isotope ratios $^{29}{\rm Si}/^{28}{\rm Si}$

helium white dwarfs (He WDs). The standard rejuvenation mechanism, in which a
low- to intermediate-mass companion to a neutron star fills its Roche lobe
between central hydrogen exhaustion and core helium ignition, is the most
plausible formation mechanism. We have investigated whether the observed
population can realistically be formed via this mechanism. We used the
Cambridge STARS code to make models of Case B RLOF with Reimers' mass loss from
the donor. We find that the range of initial orbital periods required to
produce the currently observed range of orbital periods of MSPs is extremely
narrow. To reduce this fine tuning, we introduce a companion enhanced wind
(CEW) that strips the donor of its envelope more quickly so that systems can
detach at shorter periods. Our models indicate that the fine tuning can be
significantly reduced if a CEW is active. Because significant mass is lost
owing to a CEW we expect some binary pulsars to accrete less than the 0.1Msun
needed to spin them up to millisecond periods. This can account for mildly
recycled pulsars present along the entire Mc-Porb relation. Systems with Pspin
> 30ms are consistent with this but too few of these mildly recycled pulsars
have yet been observed to make a significant comparison.

classification task, which devotes to recognizing hundreds of subcategories in
the same basic-level category. Reflecting on discriminative regions of objects,
key differences among different subcategories are subtle and local. Existing
methods generally adopt a two-stage learning framework: The first stage is to
localize the discriminative regions of objects, and the second is to encode the
discriminative features for training classifiers. However, these methods
generally have two limitations: (1) Separation of the two-stage learning is
time-consuming. (2) Dependence on object and parts annotations for
discriminative localization learning leads to heavily labor-consuming labeling.
It is highly challenging to address these two important limitations
simultaneously. Existing methods only focus on one of them. Therefore, this
paper proposes the discriminative localization approach via saliency-guided
Faster R-CNN to address the above two limitations at the same time, and our
main novelties and advantages are: (1) End-to-end network based on Faster R-CNN
is designed to simultaneously localize discriminative regions and encode
discriminative features, which accelerates classification speed. (2)
Saliency-guided localization learning is proposed to localize the
discriminative region automatically, avoiding labor-consuming labeling. Both

eliminate dependence on object and parts annotations. Comparing with the

transformation kernel for the harmonic multipoles of a general cosmological
observable with spin weight $s$, Doppler weight $d$ and arbitrary frequency
spectrum. In the context of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies, the
frequency-dependent formalism allows to correct for the motion-induced
aberration and Doppler effects on individual frequency maps with different
masks. It also permits to deboost background radiations with non-blackbody
frequency spectra, like extragalactic foregrounds and CMB spectra with
primordial spectral distortions. The formalism can also be used to correct
individual E and B polarization modes and account for motion-induced E/B mixing
of polarized observables with $d\neq1$ at different frequencies.
  We apply the generalized aberration kernel on polarized and unpolarized CMB
specific intensity at 100 and 217 GHz and show that the motion-induced effects
typically increase with the frequency of observation. In all-sky CMB
experiments, the frequency-dependence of the motion-induced effects for a
blackbody spectrum are overall negligible. However in a cut-sky analysis,
ignoring the frequency dependence can lead to percent level error in the
polarized and unpolarized power spectra over all angular scales. In the
specific cut-sky used in our analysis ($b > 45^\circ, f_\text{sky}\simeq14\%$),
and for the dipole-inferred velocity $\beta=0.00123$ typically attributed to
our peculiar motion, the Doppler and aberration effects can change polarized
and unpolarized power spectra of specific intensity in the CMB rest frame by
$1-2\%$, but we find the polarization cross-leakage between E and B modes to be
negligible.

surface release of H$_2$ or CH$_4$ gas. However, it remains unknown how much
gas could be released in a single event. We model the CH$_4$ release by one
mechanism for rapid release of CH$_4$ from clathrate. By modeling how
CH$_4$-clathrate release is affected by changes in Mars' obliquity and
atmospheric composition, we find that a large fraction of total outgassing from
CH$_4$ clathrate occurs following Mars' first prolonged atmospheric collapse.
This atmosphere-collapse-initiated CH$_4$-release mechanism has three stages.
(1) Rapid collapse of Early Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere initiates a slower
shift of water ice from high ground to the poles. (2) Upon subsequent
CO$_2$-atmosphere re-inflation and CO$_2$-greenhouse warming, low-latitude
clathrate decomposes and releases methane gas. (3) Methane can then perturb
atmospheric chemistry and surface temperature, until photochemical processes
destroy the methane. Within our model, we find that under some circumstances a
Titan-like haze layer would be expected to form, consistent with transient
deposition of abundant complex abiotic organic matter on the Early Mars
surface. We also find that this CH$_4$-release mechanism can warm Early Mars,
but special circumstances are required in order to uncork 10$^{17}$ kg of
CH$_4$, the minimum needed for strong warming. Specifically, strong warming
only occurs when the fraction of the hydrate stability zone that is initially
occupied by clathrate exceeds 10%, and when Mars' first prolonged atmospheric
collapse occurs for atmospheric pressure > 1 bar.

we derived and rigorously justified the mean field limit for the KM on graphs.
Using linear stability analysis, we identified the critical values of the

determining the onset of synchronization in this model.
  In the present paper, we study the corresponding bifurcation. Specifically,
we show that similar to the original KM with all-to-all coupling, the onset of
synchronization in the KM on graphs is realized via a pitchfork bifurcation.
The formula for the stable branch of the bifurcating equilibria involves the
principal eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the kernel
operator defined by the limit of the graph sequence used in the model. This
establishes an explicit link between the network structure and the onset of
synchronization in the KM on graphs. The results of this work are illustrated

the composition-temperature domain where the Fe$_3$Si phase can be stabilized.
Thereafter, we have developed a precipitation model capable of simulating the

optimum magnetic properties, prior work suggests that it is desirable to
precipitate Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals with 10-15 nm diameter and with the
crystalline volume fraction of about 70 \%. Based on our parameterized model,
we simulated the nucleation and growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals by isothermal
annealing of Fe$_{72.89}$Si$_{16.21}$B$_{6.90}$Nb$_{3}$Cu$_{1}$ (composition in
atomic \%). In numerical experiments, the alloys were annealed at a series of
temperatures from 490 to 550 \degree C for two hours to study the effect of
holding time on mean radius, volume fraction, size distribution, nucleation
rate, number density, and driving force for the growth of Fe$_3$Si
nanocrystals. With increasing annealing temperature, the mean radius of
Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals increases, while the volume fraction decreases. We have
also studied the effect of composition variations on the nucleation and growth
of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals. As Fe content decreases, it is possible to achieve
the desired mean radius and volume fraction within one hour holding time. The
CALPHAD approach presented here can provide efficient exploration of the

we cannot use the interval of maximum likelihood estimator since the interval
contains the value 0, which is not suitable for the Naive Bayes classifier. We
are also interested in the accuracy of existing approximation methods since
these approximation methods are frequently used but their accuracy is not well
discussed. Thus, we obtain the confidence interval by numerically integrating
the likelihood function. In this paper, we report the difference between the
confidence interval that we computed and the confidence interval by approximate
formulas. Finally, we include a URL, where all of the intervals that we
computed are available.

the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations and hence the stellar masses of
galaxies. We compare stellar masses deduced from spectral energy distribution
(SED) models, fitted to multi-wavelength optical-NIR photometry, to
luminosities derived from {\it WISE} photometry in the $W1$ and $W2$ bands at
3.6 and 4.5$\mu$m for non-star forming galaxies. The SED derived masses for a
carefully selected sample of low redshift ($z \le 0.15$) passive galaxies agree
with the prediction from stellar population synthesis models that $M_*/L_{W1}
\simeq 0.6$ for all such galaxies, independent of other stellar population
parameters. The small scatter between masses predicted from the optical SED and
from the {\it WISE} measurements implies that random errors (as opposed to
systematic ones such as the use of different IMFs) are smaller than previous,
deliberately conservative, estimates for the SED fits. This test is subtly
different from simultaneously fitting at a wide range of optical and mid-IR
wavelengths, which may just generate a compromise fit: we are directly checking
that the best fit model to the optical data generates an SED whose $M_*/L_{W1}$
is also consistent with separate mid-IR data. We confirm that for passive low
redshift galaxies a fixed $M_*/L_{W1} = 0.65$ can generate masses at least as
accurate as those obtained from more complex methods. Going beyond the mean
value, in agreement with expectations from the models, we see a modest change
in $M_*/L_{W1}$ with SED fitted stellar population age but an insignificant one

  Contract Theoretical Model with Joint Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard",,,,,"cs.NI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), spectrum trading is an efficient way for
secondary users (SUs) to achieve dynamic spectrum access and to bring economic
benefits for the primary users (PUs). Existing methods requires full payment
from SU, which blocked many potential ""buyers"", and thus limited the PU's
expected income. To better improve PUs' revenue from spectrum trading in a CRN,
we introduce a financing contract, which is similar to a sealed non-cash
auction that allows SU to do a financing. Unlike previous mechanism designs in
CRN, the financing contract allows the SU to only pay part of the total amount
when the contract is signed, known as the down payment. Then, after the
spectrum is released and utilized, the SU pays the rest of payment, known as
the installment payment, from the revenue generated by utilizing the spectrum.
The way the financing contract carries out and the sealed non-cash auction
works similarly. Thus, contract theory is employed here as the mathematical
framework to solve the non-cash auction problem and form mutually beneficial
relationships between PUs and SUs. As the PU may not have the full
acknowledgement of the SU's financial status, nor the SU's capability in making
revenue, the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard arise in the two
scenarios, respectively. Therefore, a joint adverse selection and moral hazard
model is considered here. In particular, we present three situations when
either or both adverse selection and moral hazard are present during the
trading. Furthermore, both discrete and continuous models are provided in this
paper. Through extensive simulations, we show that the adverse selection and
moral hazard cases serve as the upper and lower bounds of the general case
where both problems are present.

critical in describing chirp signals. Despite the theory of adaptive chirplet
transform (ACT) has been established for more than two decades and is well
accepted in the community of signal processing, application of ACT to
bio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because that
the power of ACT, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet been
fully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. In
this paper, we describe a novel ACT algorithm based on the ""coarse-refinement""
scheme. Namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with the
matching-pursuit (MP) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we coin as MPEM algorithm. We
emphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, which
is important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strong
background noise. We then demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by
applying it to the analysis of representative biosignals, including visual
evoked potentials (bioelectrical signals), audible heart sounds and bat
ultrasonic echolocation signals (bioacoustic signals), and human speech. The
results show that the MPEM algorithm provides more compact representation of

laboratory setups using moderate mass of liquid metals. The spin-down flow in
toroidal channels was the first flow configuration used for studying dynamo
effects in non-stationary flows. In this paper, we estimate the effect of
small-scale dynamo in liquid metal spin-down flows realized in laboratory
experiments. Our simulations have confirmed the conclusion that the dynamo
effects observed in the experiments done on gallium are weak -- a slight burst
of small-scale magnetic energy arises only at the highest available rotation
velocity of the channel. In sodium flows, the induction effects are quite
strong -- an essential part of kinetic energy of sodium spin-down flows is
converted into magnetic energy and dissipates because of Joule heat losses. We
have extended our simulations beyond the capabilities of existing laboratory
facilities and examined the spin-down flows at the channel rotation velocity
Omega>> 50 rps. It has been found that $\Omega\approx 100$rps is enough to
reach the equipartition of magnetic and kinetic spectral power density at the
lowest wave numbers (largest scales), whereas at Omega >= 200rps the intensity
of the magnetic field becomes comparable to the intensity of velocity field
fluctuations. We have also studied the influence of the Pm on the efficiency of
small-scale dynamo in spin-down flows. In the experimental spin-down flows, the
small-scale dynamo remains in a quasi-kinematic regime, and magnetic energy is
mainly dissipated at the same scale, wherein it is converted from kinetic
energy. The real small-scale dynamo starts to operate at Pm>10^{-4}, and the
inertial range of the magnetic energy spectrum appears. Thereupon the energy
dissipation is postponed to a later time and smaller scales, and the peak of
turbulent energy (both kinetic and magnetic) slightly increases with Pm.

whose masses are in the range of 0.01<=M_disc/M_*<=0.1. Here we present an
investigation on the long-term evolution of the large-scale vortices formed at
the viscosity transition of the discs' dead zone outer edge by means of
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations taking disc self-gravity into account.
We perform a numerical study of low mass, 0.001<=M_disc/M_*<=0.01, discs, for
which cases disc self-gravity was previously neglected. The large-scale
vortices are found to be stretched due to disc self-gravity even for low-mass
discs with M_disc/M_*>=0.005 where initially the Toomre Q-parameter was <=50 at
the vortex distance. As a result of stretching, the vortex aspect ratio
increases and a weaker azimuthal density contrast develops. The strength of the
vortex stretching is proportional to the disc mass. The vortex stretching can
be explained by a combined action of a non-vanishing gravitational torque
caused by the vortex, and the Keplerian shear of the disc. Self-gravitating
vortices are subject to significantly faster decay than non-self-gravitating
ones. We found that vortices developed at sharp viscosity transitions of
self-gravitating discs can be described by a GNG model as long as the disc
viscosity is low, i.e. alpha_dz<=10^-5.

the problem of the incorrect mean photon number of the hot reservoir assumed by

expected to be revealed by the incoming facilities (e.g., the Square Kilometre
Array). Under a full relativistic framework with the pulsar approximated as a
test particle, we investigate the constraints on the spinning of the MBH by
monitoring the timing of surrounding pulsars. For GC pulsars orbiting closely
around the MBH (e.g., $\lesssim1000$AU), we find that full relativistic
treatment in modeling accurately their timing signals can be necessary, as the
relativistic signals are orders of magnitude larger than the time of arrival
measurement accuracies. Although usually there are near-degeneracies among MBH
spin parameters, the constraints on the spinning of the MBH are still very
tight. By continuously monitoring a normal pulsar in orbits with a period of
$\sim2.6$yr and an eccentricity of $0.3-0.9$ under timing precision of $1-5$ms,
within $\sim 8$yr the spin magnitude and the orientations of the GC MBH can be
constrained with $2\sigma$ error of $10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}-10^\circ$,
respectively. Even for pulsars in orbits similar to the detected star S2/S0-2
or S0-102, we find that the spinning of the MBH can still be constrained within
$4-8$yr, with the most significant constraints provided near the pericenter
passage. If the proper motion of the pulsars with astrometric accuracy of
$10\mu$as can also be collected along with the timing measurement, then the
position, velocity, mass and the distance to the Solar System of the MBH can be
constrained about $\sim10\mu$as, $\sim1\mu$as$/$yr, $\sim 10 M_\odot$ and
$\sim1$pc, respectively.

In a system without any central control, the rate of interaction may depend

influence movement; individuals might seek out interactions, or their movement
in response to interaction could influence further interaction rates. We
develop a general framework to address these questions, using collision theory
to establish a baseline expected rate of interaction based on proximity. We
test the models using data from harvester ant colonies. A colony uses feedback
from interactions inside the nest to regulate foraging activity. Potential
foragers leave the nest in response to interactions with returning foragers
with food. The time series of interactions and local density of ants show how
density hotspots lead to interactions that are clustered in time. A correlated
random walk null model describes the mixing of potential and returning
foragers. A model from collision theory relates walking speed and spatial
proximity with the probability of interaction. The results demonstrate that
although ants do not mix homogeneously, trends in interaction patterns can be
explained simply by the walking speed and local density of surrounding ants.

thermal states of different temperatures, this model describes the working
principle of an absorption refrigerator that transfers energy from a cold to a
hot environment at the expense of free energy provided by a high-temperature
work reservoir. Inspired by a recent experimental realization with trapped
ions, we elucidate key features of the coupling Hamiltonian that are relevant
for the refrigerator performance. The coherent system dynamics exhibits rapid
effective equilibration of the mode energies and correlations, as well as a
transient enhancement of the cooling performance at short times. We find that
these features can be fully reproduced in a classical framework.

the kicking applied in the $\hat{z}$ direction. This is known to behave as an
inversion symmetry breaking perturbation, since it introduces a time-dependent
staggered sub-lattice potential. We study here the effects of such driving on
the topological phase diagram of the original Haldane model of a Hall effect in
the absence of a net magnetic field. The resultant Floquet band topology is
again that of a Chern insulator with the driving parameters, frequency and
amplitude, influencing the inversion breaking mass $M$ of the undriven Haldane
model. A family of such, periodically related, `Semenoff masses' is observed to
occur which support a periodic repetition of Haldane like phase diagrams along
the inversion breaking axis of the phase plots. Out of these it is possible to
identify two in-equivalent masses in the reduced zone scheme of the Floquet
quasienergies, which form the centres of two inequivalent phase diagrams.
Further, variation in the driving amplitude's magnitude alone is shown to
effect the topological properties by linearly shifting the phase diagram of the
driven model about the position of the undriven case. A phenomenon that allows
the study of Floquet topological phase transitions in the system. Finally, we
also discuss some issues regarding the modifications to Haldane's condition for
preventing band overlaps at the Dirac point touchings in the Brillouin zone, in
the presence of kicking.

with a stellar companion. We perform a 3D SPH simulation of a circumbinary disc
misaligned by $60^\circ$ with respect to the binary orbital plane. The inner
disc breaks from the outer regions, precessing as a rigid body, and leading to
a complex evolution. As the inner disc precesses, the misalignment angle
between the inner and outer discs varies by more than $100^\circ$. Different
snapshots of the evolution are post-processed with a radiative transfer code,
in order to produce observational diagnostics of the process. Even though the
simulation was produced for the specific case of a circumbinary disc, most of
the observational predictions hold for any disc hosting a precessing inner rim.
Synthetic scattered light observations show strong azimuthal asymmetries, where
the pattern depends strongly on the misalignment angle between inner and outer
disc. The asymmetric illumination of the outer disc leads to azimuthal
variations of the temperature structure, in particular in the upper layers,
where the cooling time is short. These variations are reflected in asymmetric
surface brightness maps of optically thick lines, as CO $J$=3-2. The
kinematical information obtained from the gas lines is unique in determining
the disc structure. The combination of scattered light images and (sub-)mm

One of such methods, solar atmospheric seismology, makes use of observed and

properties. A recent development in solar atmospheric seismology consists in
the use of inversion and model comparison methods based on Bayesian analysis.
In this paper, the philosophy and methodology of Bayesian analysis are first

0.59 $M_{\odot}$ and an explosion energy of 2.2$\times$10$^{51}$ erg.

energy for the main peak. The early $g$-band LC implies a radius of at least 30
$R_{\odot}$. If PTF11mnb arose from a massive He-poor star characterized by a
double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution, the ejecta mass and the absence of He
imply a large ZAMS mass ($\sim85 M_{\odot}$) for the progenitor, which most
likely was a Wolf-Rayet star, surrounded by an extended envelope formed either
by a pre-SN eruption or due to a binary configuration. Alternatively, PTF11mnb

  Decomposition of Motions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the low rank and sparse (LRS) matrix decomposition has been
introduced as an effective mean to solve the multi-view registration. It views
each available relative motion as a block element to reconstruct one matrix so
as to approximate the low rank matrix, where global motions can be recovered
for multi-view registration. However, this approach is sensitive to the
sparsity of the reconstructed matrix and it treats all block elements equally
in spite of their varied reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes an
effective approach for multi-view registration by the weighted LRS
decomposition. Based on the anti-symmetry property of relative motions, it
firstly proposes a completion strategy to reduce the sparsity of the
reconstructed matrix. The reduced sparsity of reconstructed matrix can improve
the robustness of LRS decomposition. Then, it proposes the weighted LRS
decomposition, where each block element is assigned with one estimated weight
to denote its reliability. By introducing the weight, more accurate
registration results can be recovered from the estimated low rank matrix with
good efficiency. Experimental results tested on public data sets illustrate the
superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art approaches on
robustness, accuracy, and efficiency.

  Protocol","5 figs. 7 tables",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the presence of security countermeasures, a malware designed for data
exfiltration must do so using a covert channel to achieve its goal. Among
existing covert channels stands the domain name system (DNS) protocol. Although
the detection of covert channels over the DNS has been thoroughly studied in
the last decade, previous research dealt with a specific subclass of covert
channels, namely DNS tunneling. While the importance of tunneling detection is
not undermined, an entire class of low throughput DNS exfiltration malware
remained overlooked. The goal of this study is to propose a method for
detecting both tunneling and low-throughput data exfiltration over the DNS.
Towards this end, we propose a solution composed of a supervised feature
selection method, and an interchangeable, and adjustable anomaly detection
model trained on legitimate traffic. In the first step, a one-class classifier
is applied for detecting domain-specific traffic that does not conform with the
normal behavior. Then, in the second step, in order to reduce the false
positive rate resulting from the attempt to detect the low-throughput data
exfiltration we apply a rule-based filter that filters data exchange over DNS
used by legitimate services. Our solution was evaluated on a medium-scale
recursive DNS server logs, and involved more than 75,000 legitimate uses and
almost 2,000 attacks. Evaluation results shows that while DNS tunneling is
covered with at least 99% recall rate and less than 0.01% false positive rate,
the detection of low throughput exfiltration is more difficult. While not
preventing it completely, our solution limits a malware attempting to avoid
detection with at most a 1kb/h of payload under the limitations of the DNS
syntax (equivalent to five credit cards details, or ten user credentials per
hour) which reduces the effectiveness of the attack.

Non-rigid registration of faces is significant for many applications in

Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs) unify a variety of non-rigid

domain-specific adaptions as a prior model. The novelties of this paper are the

gravitons can be efficiently produced in the untrapped region
$|\boldsymbol{x}|\gtrsim R>b$, so as to suggest a possible completion of the
unitarity sum. In fact, such energy radiation at large distances turns out to
compensate and to gradually reduce to nothing the amount of energy $E'$ being
trapped at small-$b$'s, by thus avoiding the quantum tunneling suppression of
the elastic scattering and suggesting a unitary evolution. We finally look at
the coherent radiation sample so obtained and we find that, by energy
conservation, it develops an exponential frequency damping corresponding to a
""quasi-temperature"" of order $\hbar/R$, which is naturally related to a Hawking

out to be non-predictive as soon as $z>1$, we take into account the Pad\'e
rational approximations which consist in performing expansions converging at
high redshift domains. Particularly, our strategy is to reconstruct $f(z)$
functions first, assuming the Ricci scalar to be invertible with respect to the
redshift $z$. Having the thus-obtained $f(z)$ functions, we invert them and we
easily obtain the corresponding $f(R)$ terms. We minimize error propagation,
assuming no errors upon redshift data. The treatment we follow naturally leads
to evaluating curvature pressure, density and equation of state, characterizing
the universe evolution at redshift much higher than standard cosmographic
approaches. We therefore match these outcomes with small redshift constraints
got by framing the $f(R)$ cosmology through Taylor series around $z\simeq 0$.
This gives rise to a calibration procedure with small redshift that enables the
definitions of polynomial approximations up to $z\simeq 10$. Last but not
least, we show discrepancies with the standard cosmological model which go
towards an extension of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, indicating an effective dark
energy term evolving in time. We finally describe the evolution of our
effective dark energy term by means of basic techniques of data mining.

  Network Densification?",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates two strategies to reduce the communication delay in
future wireless networks: traffic dispersion and network densification. A
hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The
probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance.
For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the
probability that the delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in
terms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network
calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival
traffic for mmWave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service
capability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The
derived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated
through simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given average
system gain, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid scheme
exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For
instance, traffic dispersion outperforms network densification, given high
average system gain and arrival rate, while it could be the worst option,
otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of
independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the
performance gain is related to the arrival rate and average system gain,
jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize
the delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and
system service capability.

how the flat space value is corrected by the Ricci curvature, the mass and the
spin of the gravitating source. Under the assumption that the magnitude of
corrections are of the order of residual uncertainties in the delay
measurement, we derive the allowed intervals for Ricci curvature. We conclude
that the terrestrial Sagnac delay can be used to constrain the parameters of
specific $f(\mathbf{R})$ prescriptions. Despite using the weak field gravity

order to simplify its use in photochemical models. This study focuses on carbon
dioxide. We performed experimental measurements of CO$_2$ absorption cross
section with synchrotron radiation for the wavelength range (115--200nm). For
longer wavelengths (195--230nm), we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5m Jobin-Yvon

to study their impact on the predicted atmospheric compositions. The cross
section of CO$_2$ increases with T. It can be separated in two parts: a
continuum and a fine structure superimposed on the continuum. The variation of
the continuum of absorption can be represented by the sum of three gaussian
functions. Using data at high T in thermo-photochemical models modifies
significantly the abundance and the photodissociation rates of many species, in
addition to CO$_2$, such as methane and ammonia. These deviations have an
impact on synthetic transmission spectra, leading to variations of up to 5 ppm.

can suddenly collapse at critical stress with hysteresis and vulnerability to

between node resilience and network resilience to environmental stress. The
nodes in the disordered networks can suppress their collapses due to the
small-world topology of the networks but eventually collapse all together in

classify video segments into interesting or uninteresting parts. The proposed
method can be applied to any sports in which games consist of a succession of
actions. Especially, this work considers the case of Kendo (Japanese fencing)

using Kendo videos with ground truth labels that indicate the video highlights.
The labels are provided by annotators possessing different experience with

VO algorithms are developed under a standard pipeline including feature
extraction, feature matching, motion estimation, local optimisation, etc.
Although some of them have demonstrated superior performance, they usually need
to be carefully designed and specifically fine-tuned to work well in different
environments. Some prior knowledge is also required to recover an absolute
scale for monocular VO. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for
monocular VO by using deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs).
Since it is trained and deployed in an end-to-end manner, it infers poses
directly from a sequence of raw RGB images (videos) without adopting any module
in the conventional VO pipeline. Based on the RCNNs, it not only automatically
learns effective feature representation for the VO problem through
Convolutional Neural Networks, but also implicitly models sequential dynamics
and relations using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI VO dataset show competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods,
verifying that the end-to-end Deep Learning technique can be a viable
complement to the traditional VO systems.

problems in power systems engineering. For the past decades, researchers have
been relying on unproven heuristics to tackle OPF. The hardness of OPF stems
from two issues: (1) non-convexity and (2) combinatoric constraints (e.g.,
discrete power extraction constraints). The recent advances in providing
sufficient conditions on the exactness of convex relaxation of OPF can address
the issue of non-convexity. To complete the understanding of OPF, this paper
presents a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the convex-relaxed
OPF with discrete demands as combinatoric constraints, which has a provably
small parameterized approximation ratio (also known as PTAS algorithm).
Together with the sufficient conditions on the exactness of the convex
relaxation, we provide an efficient approximation algorithm to solve OPF with
discrete demands, when the underlying network is radial with a fixed size and
one feeder. The running time of PTAS is $O(n^{4m/\epsilon}T)$, where $T$ is the
time required to solve a convex relaxation of the problem, and $m, \epsilon$
are fixed constants. Based on prior hardness results of OPF, our PTAS is among
the best achievable in theory. Simulations show our algorithm can produce
close-to-optimal solutions in practice.

Extracting axioms from unrestricted English input is a substantially
challenging task due to the richness of the language. Controlled natural
languages (CNLs) have been proposed in this context and these tend to be highly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a new CNL called TEDEI (TExtual

sentences into corresponding OWL-DL axioms. Now, ambiguity due to different
possible lexicalizations of sentences and semantic ambiguity present in
sentences are challenges in this context. We find that the best way to handle
these challenges is to construct axioms corresponding to alternative
formalizations of the sentence so that the end-user can make an appropriate
choice. The output is compared against human-authored axioms and in substantial
number of cases, human-authored axiom is indeed one of the alternatives given
by the system. The proposed system substantially enhances the types of sentence

the constrained variational direct-adjoint-looping (DAL) method to solve two
optimization problems, extending the optimal mixing results of Foures et al.
(2014) to stratified flows, where the mixing of the scalar density has an
energetic cost, and thus has an observable dynamic effect. We identify initial
perturbations of fixed finite kinetic energy which maximise the time-averaged
kinetic energy developed by the perturbations over a finite time interval, and
initial perturbations that minimise the value of a `mix-norm', as defined by
Thiffeault (2012) and shown by Foures et al. (2014) to be a computationally
efficient and robust proxy for identifying perturbations that minimise the
variance of a scalar distribution at a target time. We demonstrate, for all
bulk Richardson numbers considered, that the
time-averaged-kinetic-energy-maximising perturbations are significantly
suboptimal at mixing compared to the mix-norm-minimising perturbations. By
considering the time evolution of the kinetic energy and potential energy
reservoirs, we find that mix-norm-minimising optimal perturbations lead to a
flow which, through Taylor dispersion, very effectively converts perturbation
kinetic energy into `available potential energy', which in turn leads rapidly
and irreversibly to thorough and efficient mixing, with little energy returned
to the kinetic energy reservoirs.

These results thus evidenced a pressure-induced second high-Tc superconducting

the dominant electron-type carrier density undergoes a fourfold enhancement and
tracks the same trend as Tc(P). Interesting, we find a nearly parallel scaling

sample is selected to uniformly cover the available range in log(M_HI). Our
extremely deep observations, down to HI column density limits of well below
10^{18} cm^{-2} - or a few hundred times fainter than the typical HI disks in
galaxies - will directly detect the effects of cold accretion from the
intergalactic medium and the links with the cosmic web. These observations will
be the first ever to probe the very low-column density neutral gas in galaxies
at these high resolutions. Combination with data at other wavelengths, most of
it already available, will enable accurate modelling of the properties and
evolution of the mass components in these galaxies and link these with the
effects of environment, dark matter distribution, and other fundamental
properties such as halo mass and angular momentum. MHONGOOSE can already start
addressing some of the SKA-1 science goals and will provide a comprehensive
inventory of the processes driving the transformation and evolution of galaxies
in the nearby universe at high resolution and over 5 orders of magnitude in
column density. It will be a Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey that will be
unsurpassed until the advent of the SKA, and can serve as a highly visible,

on relative distance comparisons, as these are easier to elicit from human
workers than absolute distance information. A relative distance comparison is a
statement of the form ""item A is closer to item B than to item C"". However,
many existing clustering algorithms that use relative distances are rather
complex. They are often based on a two-step approach, where the relative
distances are first used to learn either a distance matrix, or an embedding of
the items, and then some standard clustering method is applied in a second
step. In this paper we argue that it should be possible to compute a clustering
directly from relative distance comparisons. Our ideas are built upon existing
work on correlation clustering, a well-known non-parametric approach to
clustering. The technical contribution of this work is twofold. We first define
a novel variant of correlation clustering that is based on relative distance
comparisons, and hence suitable for human computation. We go on to show that
our new problem is closely related to basic correlation clustering, and use
this property to design an approximation algorithm for our problem. As a second
contribution, we propose a more practical algorithm, which we empirically
compare against existing methods from literature. Experiments with synthetic
data suggest that our approach can outperform more complex methods. Also, our
method efficiently finds good and intuitive clusterings from real relative
distance comparison data.

CP approach with a global constraint (CPGC) and mixed integer linear

constrained driving range, long recharging duration, limited charging stations

directly imaged. We find a rotation-dominated velocity field, where the blue-
and red-shifted emissions are displaced along a position angle of 24 +/- 3
degrees and the approaching part of the disk is offset west of the star. The
visibility drop in the line as well as the strong non-zero phase signals can be
modeled reasonably well assuming a Keplerian velocity field, although this
model is not able to explain the 3 sigma difference that we measure between the
position angle of the line photocenters and the position angle of the dust
disk. We find that the fit can be improved by adding an outflowing component to
the velocity field, as inspired by a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind scenario.

by two plasmonic particles of circular shape, we demonstrate the relations
between these expansion schemes and their advantages and disadvantages both

ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that return full probability measures,
instead of point estimates, over the solution and can incorporate uncertainty
over the ODE at hand, e.g. if the vector field or the initial value is only
approximately known or evaluable. The ODE filter proposed in recent work models
the solution of the ODE by a Gauss-Markov process which serves as a prior in
the sense of Bayesian statistics. While previous work employed a Wiener process
prior on the (possibly multiple times) differentiated solution of the ODE and
established equivalence of the corresponding solver with classical numerical
methods, this paper raises the question whether other priors also yield
practically useful solvers. To this end, we discuss a range of possible priors
which enable fast filtering and propose a new prior--the Integrated Ornstein
Uhlenbeck Process (IOUP)--that complements the existing Integrated Wiener
process (IWP) filter by encoding the property that a derivative in time of the
solution is bounded in the sense that it tends to drift back to zero. We
provide experiments comparing IWP and IOUP filters which support the belief
that IWP approximates better divergent ODE's solutions whereas IOUP is a better
prior for trajectories with bounded derivatives.

thereby requiring validation with standard quantum measurements in addition to
the customary weak measurements used so far, as well as other advanced
techniques. We go further pursuing this goal, proposing two thought experiments
which incorporate novel yet feasible validation methods of unconventional
light-matter interactions. An excited atom traverses a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer (MZI) under a special combination of pre- and post-selection. In
the first experiment, photons emitted by the superposed atom, after being hit
by two laser beams, are individually counted. Despite the interaction having
definitely taken place, the numbers of photons emitted from each arm of the MZI
are predicted, at the ensemble level, to be different from those expected with
standard stimulated emission. In the second experiment, the atom spontaneously
emits a photon while still in the MZI. This photon later serves as a strong
measurement of the atom's energy upon hitting a photographic plate. The
experiment is repeated to enable an interference effect of the emitted photons.
Interestingly, the latter gives the appearance that the photons have been
emitted by the atom from a position much farther from the two MZI arms L and R,
as if in a ""phantom arm"" R'. These experiments also emphasize the key role of
anomalous weak values in determining light-matter interactions. In fact, they
present a straightforward realization of an entity we term counter-particles,
namely pre- and post-selected states acting as if they have negative physical
variables such as mass and energy. The novel verification methods we suggest
for testing these predictions resemble weak measurements in some aspects, yet
result from definite atomic transitions verified by the detected photons.

lowest or among the lowest ever detected. The planetary perturbation is
strongly detected, $\Delta\chi^2\sim 10,000$, because it arises from a bright
(therefore, large) source passing over and enveloping the planetary caustic: a
so-called ""Hollywood"" event. The factor $\sim 2.5$ offset in $q$ arises because
of a previously unrecognized discrete degeneracy between Hollywood events in
which the caustic is fully enveloped and those in which only one flank is
enveloped, which we dub ""Cannae"" and ""von Schlieffen"", respectively. This
degeneracy is ""accidental"" in that it arises from gaps in the data.
Nevertheless, the fact that it appears in a $\Delta\chi^2=10,000$ planetary
anomaly is striking. We present a simple formalism to estimate the sensitivity
of other Hollywood events to planets and show that they can lead to detections
close to, but perhaps not quite reaching, the Earth/Sun mass ratio of $3\times
10^{-6}$. This formalism also enables an analytic understanding of the factor
$\sim 2.5$ offset in $q$ between the Cannae and von Schlieffen solutions. The
Bayesian estimates for the host-mass, system distance, and planet-host
projected separation are $M=0.39^{+0.40}_{-0.24}\,M_\odot$,
$D_L=4.8^{+1.5}_{-1.8}\,\kpc$, and $a_\perp=3.8\pm 1.6\,\au$. The two estimates
of the planet mass are $m_p=3.3^{+3.8}_{-2.1}\,M_\oplus$ and
$m_p=8^{+11}_{-6}\,M_\oplus$. The measured lens-source relative proper motion
$\mu=6\,\masyr$ will permit imaging of the lens in about 15 years or at first
light on adaptive-optics imagers on next-generation telescopes. These will

computational and memory requirements compared to the conventional finite

the energetic norm of local fields, which has the clear physical interpretation
as being the error in the homogenised properties. This enables the comparison
of memory and computational requirements at the same level of approximation
accuracy. We show that the methods' effectiveness relies on the smoothness
(regularity) of the solution and thus on the material coefficients. Thanks to
its approximation properties, FEM outperforms FFTH for problems with jumps in
material coefficients, while ambivalent results are observed for the case that
the material coefficients vary continuously in space. FFTH profits from a good
conditioning of the linear system, independent of the number of degrees of
freedom, but generally needs more degrees of freedom to reach the same
approximation accuracy. More studies are needed for other FFT-based schemes,
non-linear problems, and dual problems (which require special treatment in FEM

sequential weak values of multi-time projection operators for a complete set of

a key to simulate astrophysical systems on spatial scales that are beyond the

non-relativistic shocks with various Alfvenic Mach numbers and magnetic field
obliquity. We recover all the features of both magnetic field amplification and
particle acceleration from previous studies when the magnetic field is parallel

amplification also occur when the magnetic field is oblique to the normal to

our simulations, the supra-thermal particles are experiencing acceleration
thanks to a pre-heating process of the particle similar to a shock drift
acceleration leading to the corrugation of the shock front. Such oscillations
of the shock front and the magnetic field locally help the particles to enter
the upstream region and to initiate a non-resonant streaming instability and
finally to induce diffuse particle acceleration.

analog/hybrid beamforming performs as well as digital beamforming in terms of

relates the parameters of a higher-order differential operator to those of a
lower-order one. The reduction matrix is theory-independent and can be obtained
by solving a set of explicitly given linear conditions. The repeated
application of such reduction matrices eventually transforms a given tree-level
CHY-like integral to a prepared form. We also provide analytic expressions for
the parameters associated with any such prepared form at tree level. We finally
give a compact expression for the multidimensional residue for any CHY-like

internal states learned indirectly by optimization of a supervised,
unsupervised, or reinforcement training loss. RNNs are used to model dynamic
processes that are characterized by underlying latent states whose form is
often unknown, precluding its analytic representation inside an RNN. In the
Predictive-State Representation (PSR) literature, latent state processes are
modeled by an internal state representation that directly models the
distribution of future observations, and most recent work in this area has
relied on explicitly representing and targeting sufficient statistics of this
probability distribution. We seek to combine the advantages of RNNs and PSRs by
augmenting existing state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks with
Predictive-State Decoders (PSDs), which add supervision to the network's
internal state representation to target predicting future observations.
Predictive-State Decoders are simple to implement and easily incorporated into
existing training pipelines via additional loss regularization. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of PSDs with experimental results in three different domains:
probabilistic filtering, Imitation Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In
each, our method improves statistical performance of state-of-the-art recurrent
baselines and does so with fewer iterations and less data.

our understanding of superfluidity in general. We use the finite amplitude
method of the quasiparticle random phase approximation on top of the Skyrme

have successfully extended this formalism and established a practical method
for extracting the Thouless-Valatin rotational moment of inertia from the

reveal the relation between the pairing correlations and the moment of inertia
of axially deformed nuclei of rare-earth and actinide regions of the nuclear

Polarimetry in the MeV energy range would provide a powerful tool to
discriminate among ""leptonic"" and ""hadronic"" emission models of blazars, for
example, but no polarimeter sensitive above 1\,MeV has ever been flown into

improve the angular resolution and the point-like sensitivity below 100 MeV. We
have shown that in the case of a homogeneous, low-density active target such as
a gas time-projection chamber (TPC), the single-track angular resolution is
even better and is so good that in addition the linear polarimetry of the
incoming radiation can be performed. We actually characterized the performance
of a prototype of such a telescope on beam. Track momentum measurement in the
tracker would enable calorimeter-free, large effective area telescopes on
low-mass space missions. An optimal unbiased momentum estimate can be obtained,

this final state in the context of simplified models with $s-$channel mediator.
We show that if the decay width of the mediator is small, these simplified

mediator mass is above 5 TeV. Finally, we point out that even if the EFT
accurately describes the ${\cal O}(\Lambda^{-2})$ contributions to the matrix
element, for values of $\Lambda$ near the current bound it receives significant
contributions of order $\Lambda^{-4}$, in the context of simplified models,
these correspond to diagrams where two mediators are exchanged. This
observation challenges the internal consistency of the EFT description since

continuum and methane band images of Saturns northern hemisphere to objectively
classify regional albedo features and aid in their dynamical interpretation.
The procedure is based on a technique applied previously to visible-infrared
images of Earth. It provides a new perspective on giant planet cloud morphology
and its relationship to the dynamics and a meteorological context for the
analysis of other types of simultaneous Saturn observations. The method
identifies six clusters that exhibit distinct morphology, vertical structure,
and preferred latitudes of occurrence. These correspond to areas dominated by
deep convective cells; low contrast areas, some including thinner and thicker
clouds possibly associated with baroclinic instability; regions with possible
isolated thin cirrus clouds; darker areas due to thinner low level clouds or
clearer skies due to downwelling, or due to absorbing particles; and fields of
relatively shallow cumulus clouds. The spatial associations among these cloud
types suggest that dynamically, there are three distinct types of latitude
bands on Saturn: deep convectively disturbed latitudes in cyclonic shear
regions poleward of the eastward jets; convectively suppressed regions near and
surrounding the westward jets; and baroclinically unstable latitudes near
eastward jet cores and in the anti-cyclonic regions equatorward of them. These
are roughly analogous to some of the features of Earths tropics, subtropics,
and midlatitudes, respectively. Temporal variations of feature contrast and
cluster occurrence suggest that the upper tropospheric haze in the northern
hemisphere may have thickened by 2014.

potentially observable fluxes of gamma rays, unaccompanied by emission at other
wavelengths. Furthermore, this gamma-ray emission is expected to be spatially
extended, providing us with a powerful way to discriminate dark matter subhalos
from other astrophysical gamma-ray sources. Fermi has detected two dark matter
subhalo candidates which exhibit a statistically significant degree of spatial
extension (3FGL J2212.5+0703 and 3FGL J1924.8-1034). It has been argued that
the most likely non-dark matter interpretation of these observations is that
they are each in fact multiple nearby point sources, too close to one another
on the sky to be individually resolved. In this study, we consider the ability
of next generation gamma-ray telescopes to spatially resolve the gamma-ray
emission from subhalo candidates, focusing on the proposed e-ASTROGAM mission.
We find that such an instrument could significantly clarify the nature of
Fermi's dark matter subhalo candidates, and provide an unprecedented level of
sensitivity to the presence of annihilating dark matter in nearby subhalos.

some amount of optical geometric distortion. Recently, the diffraction-limited

corrected instruments on ground based-telescope, have increased the relative
importance of the error terms induced by optical distortions. In particular,
variable distortions present in Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optics (MCAO) data
are limiting the astrometry and photometry accuracy of such high resolution
instruments. From there, the ability to deal with those phenomenon had become a
critical issue for high-precision studies. We present in this paper an optimal
method of distortion correction for high angular resolution images. Based on a
prior-knowledge of the static distortion the method aims to correct the
dynamical distortions specifically for each observation set and each frame. The
method follows an inverse problem approach based on the work done by Gratadour
et al. 2005 on image re-centering, and we aim to generalized it to any kind of
distortion mode. The complete formalism of a Weighted Least Square
minimization, as well as a detailed characterization of the error budget are
presented. In particular we study the influence of different parameters such as
the number of frames and the density of the field (sparse or crowed images), of
the noise level, and of the aliasing effect. Finally, we show the first
application of the method on real observations collected with the Gemini MCAO

of the kind we manipulate with language. This prior can be combined with other
priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors from each other. It is
inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness, seen as a
bottleneck through which just a few elements, after having been selected by
attention from a broader pool, are then broadcast and condition further
processing, both in perception and decision-making. The set of recently
selected elements one becomes aware of is seen as forming a low-dimensional
conscious state. This conscious state is combining the few concepts
constituting a conscious thought, i.e., what one is immediately conscious of at
a particular moment. We claim that this architectural and
information-processing constraint corresponds to assumptions about the joint
distribution between high-level concepts. To the extent that these assumptions
are generally true (and the form of natural language seems consistent with
them), they can form a useful prior for representation learning. A
low-dimensional thought or conscious state is analogous to a sentence: it
involves only a few variables and yet can make a statement with very high
probability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution (over
high-level concepts) which has the form of a sparse factor graph, i.e., where
the dependencies captured by each factor of the factor graph involve only very
few variables while creating a strong dip in the overall energy function. The
consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natural
language utterances or to express classical AI knowledge in a form similar to
facts and rules, albeit capturing uncertainty as well as efficient search
mechanisms implemented by attention mechanisms.

quantification (UQ) deals with the estimation of statistics of the system
response, given a computational model of the system and a probabilistic model
of its inputs. In engineering applications it is common to assume that the
inputs are mutually independent or coupled by a Gaussian or elliptical
dependence structure (copula). In this paper we overcome such limitations by
modelling the dependence structure of multivariate inputs as vine copulas. Vine
copulas are models of multivariate dependence built from simpler pair-copulas.
The vine representation is flexible enough to capture complex dependencies.
This paper formalises the framework needed to build vine copula models of
multivariate inputs and to combine them with virtually any UQ method. The
framework allows for a fully automated, data-driven inference of the
probabilistic input model on available input data. The procedure is exemplified
on two finite element models of truss structures, both subject to inputs with
non-Gaussian dependence structures. For each case, we analyse the moments of
the model response (using polynomial chaos expansions), and perform a
structural reliability analysis to calculate the probability of failure of the
system (using the first order reliability method and importance sampling).
Reference solutions are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The results show
that, while the Gaussian assumption yields biased statistics, the vine copula
representation achieves significantly more precise estimates, even when its
structure needs to be fully inferred from a limited amount of observations.

the existence of such entities not only with a single-side tail, but also with
periodic tails on both ends. These tails are found to oscillate with the

spectrum. To achieve an approximately omni- directional coverage with a similar
effective antenna aperture compared to state of the art cellular systems, an
antenna array is required at both the mobile and basestation. Due to the large
bandwidth and inefficient amplifiers available in CMOS for mmWave, the analog
front-end of the receiver with a large number of antennas becomes especially
power hungry. Two main solutions exist to reduce the power consumption: hybrid
beam forming and digital beam forming with low resolution Analog to Digital
Converters (ADCs). In this work we compare the spectral and energy efficiency
of both systems under practical system constraints. We consider the effects of
channel estimation, transmitter impairments and multiple simultaneous users.
Our power consumption model considers components reported in literature at 60
GHz. In contrast to many other works we also consider the correlation of the
quantization error, and generalize the modeling of it to non-uniform quantizers
and different quantizers at each antenna. The result shows that as the SNR gets
larger the ADC resolution achieving the optimal energy efficiency gets also
larger. The energy efficiency peaks for 5 bit resolution at high SNR, since due
to other limiting factors the achievable rate almost saturates at this
resolution. We also show that in the multi-user scenario digital beamforming is
in any case more energy efficient than hybrid beamforming. In addition we show
that if different ADC resolutions are used we can achieve any desired
trade-offs between power consumption and rate close to those achieved with only
one ADC resolution.

  arXiv:1605.02816",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a previous work (Akian, Fodjo, 2016), we introduced a lower complexity
probabilistic max-plus numerical method for solving fully nonlinear
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to diffusion control problems
involving a finite set-valued (or switching) control and possibly a
continuum-valued control. This method was based on the idempotent expansion
properties obtained by McEneaney, Kaise and Han (2011) and on the numerical
probabilistic method proposed by Fahim, Touzi and Warin (2011) for solving some
fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. A difficulty of the
algorithm of Fahim, Touzi and Warin is in the critical constraints imposed on
the Hamiltonian to ensure the monotonicity of the scheme, hence the convergence
of the algorithm. Here, we propose a new ""probabilistic scheme"" which is
monotone under rather weak assumptions, including the case of strongly elliptic
PDE with bounded coefficients. This allows us to apply our probabilistic
max-plus method in more general situations. We illustrate this on the
evaluation of the superhedging price of an option under uncertain correlation
model with several underlying stocks and changing sign cross gamma, and
consider in particular the case of 5 stocks leading to a PDE in dimension 5.

Schroeder conjectured that if a graph has genus $g,$ then its cop number is at

higher-order graphical models by means of a traditional linear programming
relaxation approach. In fact, the proof that we have developed in this paper is
a rather simple algebraic proof being made straightforward, above all, by the
introduction of two novel algebraic tools. Indeed, on the one hand, we
introduce the notion of delta-distribution which merely stands for the
difference of two arbitrary probability distributions, and which mainly serves
to alleviate the sign constraint inherent to a traditional probability
distribution. On the other hand, we develop an approximation framework of
general discrete functions by means of an orthogonal projection expressing in
terms of linear combinations of function margins with respect to a given
collection of point subsets, though, we rather exploit the latter approach for
the purpose of modeling locally consistent sets of discrete functions from a
global perspective. After that, as a first step, we develop from scratch the
expectation optimization framework which is nothing else than a reformulation,
on stochastic grounds, of the convex-hull approach, as a second step, we
develop the traditional LP relaxation of such an expectation optimization
approach, and we show that it enables to solve the MAP inference problem in
graphical models under rather general assumptions. Last but not least, we
describe an algorithm which allows to compute an exact MAP solution from a
perhaps fractional optimal (probability) solution of the proposed LP
relaxation.

in the southern hemisphere.Recently, China has launched the Ali CMB
Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) in Tibetan Plateau to measure CMB B mode
polarization and detect the PGWs in northern hemisphere. AliCPT include two
stages, the first one is to build a telescope at the 5250m site (AliCPT-1) and
the second one is to have a more sensitive telescope at a higher altitude of
about 6000m (AliCPT-2). In this paper, we report the atmospherical conditions,
sky coverage and the current infrastructure associated with AliCPT. We analyzed
the reanalysis data from MERRA-2 together with radiosonde data from the Ali
Meteorological Service and found that the amount of water vapor has a heavy
seasonal variation and October to March is the suitable observation time. We
also found 95/150 GHz to be feasible for AliCPT-1 and higher frequencies to be
possible for AliCPT-2. Then we analyzed the observable sky and the target
fields, and showed that Ali provides us a unique opportunity to observe CMB
with less foreground contamination in the northern hemisphere and is
complementary to the existed southern CMB experiments. Together with the
developed infrastructure, we point out that Ali opens a new window for CMB
observation and will be one of the major sites in the world along with
Antarctic and Atacama.

spinors, a Fock space ${\mathcal F}$ of multiparticle states and a space
${\mathcal H}$ of fermionic multiparticle states which forms a Grassmann
algebra. These algebras are defined constructively and emerge from the
requirement of covariance associated with the geometry of space-time. (Here $K$
is the structure group of a certain principal bundle associated with a given
M\""{o}bius structure modeling space-time.) Scattering processes are associated
with intertwining operators between various algebras, which are encoded in an
associated bundle of kernel algebras. Supersymmetry emerges naturally from the
algebraic structure of the theory. Kernels can be generated using $K$ covariant
matrix valued measures given a suitable definition of covariance. It is shown
how Feynman propagators, fermion loops and the electron self energy can be
given well defined interpretations as measures covariant in this sense. An
example of the methods described in the paper is given in which the first order
Feynman amplitude of electro-electron scattering ($ee\rightarrow ee$) is
derived from a simple order (2,2) kernel. A second example is given explaining

The effect is largely independent of the detailed parameters of the system, in
particular the width of the gap. The implication is that for a narrow gap, a
small perturbation in the chemical potential of the lead can give a sign
reversal of the exchange coupling. This offers the possibility of controlling
magnetization switching in spintronic devices such as MRAM, with little power
consumption. Furthermore we believe that this effect has already been
indirectly observed, in existing measurements of the IEC as a function of
temperature and of doping of the leads.
