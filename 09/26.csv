conformal anomaly for free fields on spheres is generalised to hemispheres with
Neumann (N) and Dirichlet (D) conditions at the rim for GJMS scalar fields. It
is shown that the N minus D interpolation is minus a quarter of that for a
higher derivative fermion on the spherical rim. In particular, since, for
ordinary bosons k=1, the related fermion is irregular propagating according to
a second order (pseudo) operator. (2k is the derivative order in the equation
of motion.)
  It is suggested that the relation has a role to play in the Type--B AdS/CFT
mismatch. The DN boundary value problem is enlarged upon in the context of
Branson and Gover's construction of the D to N operator. Contact is made with a

stationary solution with strong complexity guarantee (e.g., almost linear time
complexity in the problem's dimensionality). In this paper, we propose to
further reduce the number of Hessian-vector products for faster non-convex
optimization. Previous algorithms need to approximate the smallest eigen-value
with a sufficient precision (e.g., $\epsilon_2\ll 1$) in order to achieve a
sufficiently accurate second-order stationary solution (i.e.,
$\lambda_{\min}(\nabla^2 f(\x))\geq -\epsilon_2)$. In contrast, the proposed
algorithms only need to compute the smallest eigen-vector approximating the
corresponding eigen-value up to a small power of current gradient's norm. As a
result, it can dramatically reduce the number of Hessian-vector products during
the course of optimization before reaching first-order stationary points (e.g.,
saddle points). The key building block of the proposed algorithms is a novel
updating step named the NCG step, which lets a noisy negative curvature descent
compete with the gradient descent. We show that the worst-case time complexity
of the proposed algorithms with their favorable prescribed accuracy
requirements can match the best in literature for achieving a second-order
stationary point but with an arguably smaller per-iteration cost. We also show
that the proposed algorithms can benefit from inexact Hessian by developing
their variants accepting inexact Hessian under a mild condition for achieving
the same goal. Moreover, we develop a stochastic algorithm for a finite or
infinite sum non-convex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed stochastic algorithm is the first one that converges to a second-order
stationary point in {\it high probability} with a time complexity independent
of the sample size and almost linear in dimensionality.

simultaneous X-ray and radio continuum coverage for the first time
unambiguously show a highly reproducible, anti-correlated variability pattern.
The characteristic switches from the X-ray high mode into a low mode are always
accompanied by a radio brightening with duration that closely matches the X-ray
low mode interval. This behavior cannot be explained by a canonical
inflow/outflow accretion model where the radiated emission and the jet
luminosity are powered by, and positively correlated with, the available
accretion energy. We interpret this phenomenology as alternating episodes of
low-level accretion onto the neutron star during the X-ray high mode that are
interrupted by rapid ejections of plasma by the active rotation-powered pulsar,
possibly initiated by a reconfiguration of the pulsar magnetosphere, that cause
a transition to a less luminous X-ray mode. The observed anti-correlation
between radio and X-ray luminosity has an additional consequence: transitional
MSPs can make excursions into a region of the radio/X-ray luminosity plane
previously thought to be occupied solely by black hole X-ray binary sources.
This complicates the use of this luminosity relation to identify candidate
black holes, suggesting the need for additional discriminants when attempting
to establish the true nature of the accretor.

are located on a system of roads. We model the roadways, which are
predominantly straight and randomly oriented, by a Poisson line process (PLP)
and the locations of nodes on each road as a homogeneous 1D Poisson point
process (PPP). Assuming that each node transmits independently, the locations
of transmitting and receiving nodes are given by two Cox processes driven by
the same PLP. For this setup, we derive the coverage probability of a typical
receiver, which is an arbitrarily chosen receiving node, assuming independent
Nakagami-$m$ fading over all wireless channels. Assuming that the typical
receiver connects to its closest transmitting node in the network, we first
derive the distribution of the distance between the typical receiver and the
serving node to characterize the desired signal power. We then characterize
coverage probability for this setup, which involves two key technical
challenges. First, we need to handle several cases as the serving node can
possibly be located on any line in the network and the corresponding
interference experienced at the typical receiver is different in each case.
Second, conditioning on the serving node imposes constraints on the spatial
configuration of lines, which require careful analysis of the conditional
distribution of the lines. We address these challenges in order to accurately
characterize the interference experienced at the typical receiver. We then
derive an exact expression for coverage probability in terms of the derivative
of Laplace transform of interference power distribution. We analyze the trends
in coverage probability as a function of the network parameters: line density
and node density. We also study the asymptotic behavior of this model and
compare the coverage performance with that of a homogeneous 2D PPP model with
the same node density.

an upper mass gap, predicting an absence of black holes in the mass range
$50\lesssim M\lesssim135\,M_\odot$. We argue that the absence of detected
binary systems with component masses heavier than $\sim40\,M_\odot$ may be
preliminary evidence for this upper mass gap. By allowing for the presence of a
mass gap, we find weaker constraints on the shape of the underlying mass
distribution of binary black holes. We fit a power-law distribution with an
upper mass cutoff to real and simulated BBH mass measurements, finding that the
first 3.9 BBHs favor shallow power law slopes $\alpha \lesssim 3$ and an upper
mass cutoff $M_\mathrm{max} \sim 40\,M_\odot$. This inferred distribution is
entirely consistent with the two recently reported detections, GW170608 and

fitting the BH mass distribution will provide strong evidence for an upper mass

using a pool of several protocols of spatio-temporal encodings, the suitability
of each code and their performance as a function of network parameters and

paper sheds light on this by modeling small-size networks of chemically and
electrically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose spiking neurons. We focus on a class of
temporal and firing-rate codes that result from neurons' membrane-potentials

Information Rate, aka the rate of information exchange. Our results suggest
that the firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes are more robust to additive
Gaussian white noise. In a network of four interconnected neurons and in the
absence of such noise, pairs of neurons that have the largest rate of
information exchange using the interspike-intervals and firing-rate codes are

would have been possible to extend to larger neural networks, it would suggest
that small microcircuits would preferably exchange information using temporal

there would be typically pairs of neurons not directly connected due to the
brain's sparsity, firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes would be the most

derivatives have been primarily developed to be applied sparsely --- at image
points where the magnitude of a scale-normalized differential expression
additionally assumes local extrema over the domain where the data are defined.
This paper presents a methodology for performing dense scale selection, so that
hypotheses about local characteristic scales in images, temporal signals and
video can be computed at every image point and every time moment.
  A critical problem when designing mechanisms for dense scale selection is
that the scale at which scale-normalized differential entities assume local
extrema over scale can be strongly dependent on the local order of the locally
dominant differential structure. To address this problem, we propose a
methodology where local extrema over scale are detected of a quasi quadrature
measure involving scale-space derivatives up to order two and propose two
independent mechanisms to reduce the phase dependency of the local scale
estimates by: (i) introducing a second layer of post-smoothing prior to the
detection of local extrema over scale and (ii) performing local phase
compensation based on a model of the phase dependency of the local scale
estimates depending on the relative strengths between first- vs. second-order
differential structure.
  This general methodology is applied over three types of domains: (i) spatial
images, (ii) temporal signals and (iii) spatio-temporal video. Experiments show
that the proposed methodology leads to intuitively reasonable results with
local scale estimates that reflect variations in the characteristic scales of
locally dominant structures over space and time.

private signal into the control, whereby attacks are identified by checking the

entire system is neither controllable nor observable by a single subcontroller,
communication of sensor measurements is required to ensure closed-loop

each sub-controller, and we provide two approaches to design such a controller
using Heymann's lemma and a multi-input generalization of Heymann's lemma. The

geochemical cycling between atmosphere, surface, and interior reservoirs.
Despite this, ""Earth-like"" is often defined as a planet made of a mixture of
rock and Fe that is roughly 1 Earth-density. To understand the interior of a
terrestrial planet, the stellar abundances of planet-building elements (e.g.
Mg, Si, and Fe) can be utilized as a proxy for the planet's composition. We
explore the planetary mineralogy and structure for fictive planets around the
10 closest stars to the Sun using stellar abundances from the Hypatia Catalog.
Despite our sample containing stars both sub- and super-solar in their
abundances, we find that the mineralogies are very similar for all 10 planets
-- since the error or spread in the stellar abundances create significant
degeneracy in the models. We show that abundance uncertainties need to be on

[Mg/H] and [Ca/H] < 0.001 dex, in order to distinguish two unique planetary
populations in our sample of 10 stars. While these precisions are high, we
believe they are possible given certain abundance techniques, in addition to
methodological transparency, recently demonstrated in the literature. However,
without these precisions, the uncertainty in planetary structures will be so
high that we will be unable to say confidently that a planet is like the Earth,

of $30\times$ solar. The transmission spectrum shows strong evidence for water
absorption ($6.5\,\sigma$ confidence), and the retrieved water abundance is
consistent with expectations for a solar abundance pattern. The inferred

transformation. We explain how to extend the top sector such that this $Z_2$
remains intact while the rest of the shift symmetry is explicitly broken,
resulting in the cancelation of the quadratic divergences in the Higgs
potential. Assuming additional structure (for example partial compositeness
with maximal symmetry) can render the Higgs potential completely finite and
with minimal tuning. We apply our principles to construct the minimal model
realizing trigonometric parity based on $SO(6)/SO(5) \simeq SU(4)/Sp(4)$,
yielding the simplest model of neutral naturalness. An added advantage of this
model is that a simple fermionic UV completion can be easily identified. We
analyze the tuning of the Higgs potential and find that the top partners can be
quite heavy while vector mesons need to be relatively light to obtain minimal
tuning. Finally we briefly comment on some novel phenomenology, including a
possible six top final state at the LHC appearing in this model.

that the BTZ black hole entropy is either the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,

outflow rates $\approx 10^3 - 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$, but short-lived
($< 10 \, \rm Myr$). Outflowing material is multi-phase, though predominantly
composed of cool gas, forming via a thermal instability in the shocked swept-up
component. Radiation pressure- and thermally-driven outflows both affect their
host galaxies significantly, but in different, complementary ways.
Thermally-driven outflows couple more efficiently to diffuse halo gas,
generating more powerful, hotter and more volume-filling outflows. IR
radiation, through its ability to penetrate dense gas via diffusion, is more
efficient at ejecting gas from the bulge. The combination of gas ejection
through outflows with internal pressurisation by trapped IR radiation leads to
a complete shut down of star formation in the bulge. We hence argue that
radiation pressure-driven feedback may be an important ingredient in regulating
star formation in compact starbursts, especially during the quasar's `obscured'
phase.

The Ward identity constrains correlation functions of the sigma model such that
the Adler's zero is guaranteed for $S$-matrix elements, and gives rise to a
subleading single soft theorem that is valid at the quantum level and to all
orders in the Goldstone decay constant. For tree amplitudes, the Ward identity
leads to a novel Berends-Giele recursion relation as well as an explicit form
of the subleading single soft factor. Furthermore, interactions of the cubic
biadjoint scalar theory associated with the single soft limit, which was
previously discovered using the Cachazo-He-Yuan representation of tree

corresponding to the generalized shift symmetry.

orbits change almost instantaneously, which can lead to the development of a
sharply contoured density profile, including singular caustics for
collisionless systems. This framework can be used to model a variety of
dynamical systems, such as accretion disks following a massive black hole
merger and dwarf galaxies following violent early star formation feedback.
Particle interactions in the high-density peaks seem a promising source of
observable signatures of these mass loss events (i.e. a possible EM counterpart
for black hole mergers or strong gamma-ray emission from dark matter
annihilation around young galaxies), because the interaction rate depends on
the square of the density. We study post-mass-loss density profiles, both
analytic and numerical, in idealised cases and present arguments and methods to
extend to any general system. An analytic derivation is presented for particles
on Keplerian orbits responding to a drop in the central mass. We argue that
this case, with initially circular orbits, gives the most sharply contoured
profile possible. We find that despite the presence of a set of singular
caustics, the total particle interaction rate is reduced compared to the
unperturbed system; this is a result of the overall expansion of the system
dominating over the steep caustics. Finally we argue that this result holds
more generally, and the loss of central mass decreases the particle interaction
rate in any physical system.

of two level atoms with a quantized light field. It is realized within cavity
QED experiments, which in addition to the coherent Dicke dynamics feature
dissipation due to e.g. atomic spontaneous emission and cavity photon loss.
Spontaneous emission supports the uncorrelated decay of individual atomic
excitations as well as the enhanced, collective decay of an excitation that is
shared by $N$ atoms and whose strength is determined by the cavity geometry. We
derive a many-body master equation for the dissipative Dicke model including
both spontaneous emission channels and analyze its dynamics on the basis of
Heisenberg-Langevin and stochastic Bloch equations. We find that the collective
loss channel leads to a region of bistability between the empty and the
superradiant state. Transitions between these states are driven by non-thermal,
markovian noise. The interplay between dissipative and coherent elements leads
to a genuine non-equilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime, which is
expressed via a non-conservative force and a multiplicative noise kernel
appearing in the stochastic Bloch equations. We present a semiclassical
approach, based on stochastic nonlinear optical Bloch equations, which for the
infinite-range Dicke Model become exact in the large-$N$-limit. The absence of
an effective free energy functional, however, necessitates to include
fluctuation corrections with $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ for finite $N<\infty$ to locate
the non-thermal first-order phase transition between the superradiant and the

angular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in Galform that
newly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc
leads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular
momentum of disc galaxies. In Eagle, stars form preferentially out of low
specific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the
assumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic
galaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between Galform and
Eagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various
indications that the rate of baryon cycling in Eagle is slower than is assumed
in Galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between Eagle and Galform,
we find that an artificial dependence of AGN feedback and gas infall rates on
halo mass doubling events in Galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass
between individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the Galform
semi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.

of highly energetic particles into states with very high numbers of relatively
soft Higgs bosons. In this paper we study quantum effects in the presence of
Higgsplosion. First, we provide a non-perturbative definition of Higgsplosion
as a resolved short-distance singularity of quantum propagators at distances
shorter than the inverse Higgsplosion energy scale, $E_*$. We then consider
quantum effects arising from loops in perturbation theory with these
propagators on internal lines. When the loop momenta exceed the Higgsplosion
scale $E_*$, the theory dynamics deviates from what is expected in the standard
QFT settings without Higgsplosion. The UV divergences are automatically
regulated by the Higgsplosion scale, leading to the change of slopes for the
running couplings at the RG scales $\mu > E_*$. Thus, the theory becomes
asymptotically safe. Further, we find that the finite parts are also modified
and receive power-suppressed corrections in $1/E_*^2$. We use these results to
compute a set of precision observables for the Higgsploding Standard Model.
These and other precision observables could provide experimental evidence and
tests for the existence of Higgsplosion in particle physics.

from any CSS code of code distance $d$ and divisor $2^\nu$ where the
transversal $X$ is a nontrivial logical operator. The encoding rate of the new

may not operate in local pressure maxima where solids accumulate. From a linear
analysis of stability, we show that streaming instability behaves differently
inside local pressure maxima. Under the action of the strong differential
advection imposed by the bump, a novel unstable mode develops and grows even
when gas viscosity is large. Hence, pressure bumps are found to be the only
places where streaming instability occurs in viscous discs. This offers a
promising way to conciliate models of planet formation with recent observations

an additional, late-time contribution to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave

integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect to the CMB angular power spectrum has been
detected and studied in detail, but reconstructing its spatial contributions to
the CMB $\textit{map}$, which would offer the tantalizing possibility of
separating the early- from the late-time contributions to CMB temperature
fluctuations, is more challenging. Here we study the technique for
reconstructing the ISW map based on information from galaxy surveys and focus
in particular on how its accuracy is impacted by the presence of photometric
calibration errors in input galaxy maps, which were previously found to be a
dominant contaminant for ISW signal estimation. We find that both including
tomographic information from a single survey and using data from multiple,
complementary galaxy surveys improve the reconstruction by effectively
self-calibrating the estimator against spurious power contributions from
calibration errors. A high-fidelity reconstruction further requires one to
account for the contribution of calibration errors to the observed galaxy power
spectrum in the model used to construct the ISW estimator. We find that if the
photometric calibration errors in galaxy surveys can be independently
controlled at the level required to obtain unbiased dark energy constraints,
then it is possible to reconstruct ISW maps with excellent accuracy using a
combination of maps from two galaxy surveys with properties similar to Euclid
and SPHEREx.

centralized cloud to the proximity of data sources, thereby reducing service
provision latency and saving backhaul network bandwidth. Although computation
offloading has been extensively studied in the literature, service caching is
an equally, if not more, important design topic of MEC, yet receives much less
attention. Service caching refers to caching application services and their
related data (libraries/databases) in the edge server, e.g. MEC-enabled Base
Station (BS), enabling corresponding computation tasks to be executed. Since
only a small number of services can be cached in resource-limited edge server
at the same time, which services to cache has to be judiciously decided to
maximize the system performance. In this paper, we investigate collaborative
service caching in MEC-enabled dense small cell (SC) networks. We propose an
efficient decentralized algorithm, called CSC (Collaborative Service Caching),
where a network of small cell BSs optimize service caching collaboratively to
address a number of key challenges in MEC systems, including service
heterogeneity, spatial demand coupling, and decentralized coordination. Our
algorithm is developed based on parallel Gibbs sampling by exploiting the
special structure of the considered problem using graphing coloring. The
algorithm significantly improves the time efficiency compared to conventional
Gibbs sampling, yet guarantees provable convergence and optimality. CSC is
further extended to the SC network with selfish BSs, where a coalitional game
is formulated to incentivize collaboration. A coalition formation algorithm is
developed by employing the merge-and-split rules and ensures the stability of
the SC coalitions.

We employ the analogy between a single map subject to a constant drive and the
effective local dynamics in the globally coupled map system to elucidate the
mechanisms for the emergence of asymmetric chimera and cluster states in the
latter system. By obtaining the dynamical responses of the driven map, we
establish a condition for the equivalence of the dynamics of the driven map and

EDMR measurements have shown very similar dominant hyperfine (HF) spectra in
differently processed MOSFETs although some discrepancies were observed in the

understand complex systems that are impacted by parametric uncertainty. The
polynomial chaos method is a computational approach to solve stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDE) by projecting the solution onto a space of
orthogonal polynomials of the stochastic variables and solving for the
deterministic coefficients. Polynomial chaos can be more efficient than Monte
Carlo methods when the number of stochastic variables is low, and the
integration time is not too large. When performing long-term integration,
however, achieving accurate solutions often requires the space of polynomial
functions to become unacceptably large. This paper presents an alternative
approach, where sets of empirical basis functions are constructed by examining
the behavior of the solution for fixed values of the random variables. The
empirical basis functions are evolved over time, which means that the total
number can be kept small, even when performing long-term integration. We
introduce this method of empirical chaos expansion, and apply it to a number of
model equations, demonstrating that the computational time scales linearly with
the final integration time. That is not the case for polynomial chaos in
general, since achieving accuracy for long-term integration usually requires
larger polynomial bases, causing a nonlinear scaling with the final integration
time. We also present an analytical method that uses the dynamics of the SPDE
to evolve the empirical basis functions and demonstrate how it can be applied
to extend the validity of empirical basis functions in time without the need to
sample additional realizations of the original SPDE.

sequence. Here, we model the SN radiation arising from the low-energy explosion
of RSG stars of 12, 25, and 27 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence and formed
through single star evolution. Despite the narrow range in ejecta kinetic
energy (2.5$-$4.2$\times$10$^{50}$ erg) in our model set, the SN observables
from our three models are significantly distinct, reflecting the differences in
progenitor structure (e.g., surface radius, H-rich envelope mass, He-core
mass). Our higher mass RSG stars give rise to Type II SNe that tend to have
bluer colors at early times, a shorter photospheric phase, and a faster
declining $V$-band light curve (LC) more typical of Type II-linear SNe, in
conflict with the LC plateau observed for low-luminosity SNe II. The complete
fallback of the CO core in the low-energy explosions of our high mass RSG stars
prevents the ejection of any ${}^{56}$Ni (nor any core O or Si), in contrast to
low-luminosity SNe II-P, which eject at least 0.001 M$_{\odot}$ of ${}^{56}$Ni.
In contrast to observations, type II SN models from higher mass RSGs tend to
show an H$\alpha$ absorption that remains broad at late times (due to a larger
velocity at the base of the H-rich envelope). In agreement with the analyses of
pre-explosion photometry, we conclude that low-luminosity SNe II-P likely arise
from low-mass rather than high-mass RSG stars.

particular, we show how the $\mu_0$ and $\bar{\mu}$ schemes introduced in Loop
Quantum Cosmology (LQC) emerge with specific choices of density matrices.
Within this new scheme we compute effective Hamiltonians suitable to describe
quantum corrected Friedmann and Bianchi I universes and their leading orders
coincide with the corresponding effective LQC Hamiltonians in the $\bar{\mu}$

monitoring campaign of Luhman 16AB (L7.5 + T0.5). We assess the variability
amplitude as a function of pressure level in the atmosphere of Luhman 16B: the
more variable of the two components. The amplitude decreases monotonically with
decreasing pressure, indicating that the source of variability - most likely
patchy clouds - lies in the lower atmosphere. An unexpected result is that the
strength of the K I absorption is higher in the faint state of Luhman 16B and
lower in the bright state. We conclude that either the abundance of K I
increases when the clouds roll in, potentially because of additional K I in the
cloud itself, or that the temperature-pressure profile changes. We reproduce
the change in K I absorption strengths with combinations of spectral templates
to represent the bright and the faint variability states. These are dominated
by a warmer L8 or L9 component, with a smaller contribution from a cooler T1 or
T2 component. The success of this approach argues that the mechanism
responsible for brown dwarf variability is also behind the diverse spectral
morphology across the L-to-T transition. We further suggest that the L9-T1 part
of the sequence represents a narrow but random ordering of effective
temperatures and cloud fractions, obscured by the monotonic progression in
methane absorption strength.

artifacts commonly resulting from inconsistency between the guidance and target

appropriate guidance information via joint sparse representation induced by

directionally dependent and varies with time due to a number of reasons. Some
factors, such as rotation of the primary beam with Parallactic Angle for
Azimuth-Elevation mount antennas are known a priori. Some, such as antenna

systems, over a broader range of parameter space. We show that this fraction
grows with time, unlike triple systems evolved at quadrupole order. This is
fundamentally because with their additional degrees of freedom, quadruple
systems do not have a maximal set of commuting constants of the motion, even in
secular theory at quadrupole order. We discuss these results in the context of
star-star and white dwarf-white dwarf(WD) binaries, with emphasis on WD-WD
mergers and collisions relevant to the Type Ia supernova problem. For star-star
systems, we find that more than 30% of systems reach high eccentricity within a
Hubble time, potentially forming triple systems via stellar mergers or close
binaries. For WD-WD systems, taking into account general relativistic and tidal
precession and dissipation, we show that the merger rate is enhanced in
quadruple systems relative to triple systems by a factor of 3.5-10, and that
the long-term evolution of quadruple systems leads to a delay-time distribution
~1/t for mergers and collisions. In GW-driven mergers of compact objects, we
classify the mergers by their evolutionary patterns in phase space and identify
a regime in ~8% of orbital shrinking mergers, where eccentricity oscillations
occur on the general relativistic precession timescale, rather than the much
longer LK timescale. Finally, we generalize previous treatments of oscillations

merger rate in quadruple and triple systems and the implications for their
viability as progenitors of stellar mergers and SNe Ia.

free of a magnetic field. Most of all-optical-spin-reversal ferromagnets are
found to have a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), but it has been
unknown whether PMA is necessary for the spin reversal. Here we theoretically
investigate magnetic thin films with either PMA or in-plane magnetic anisotropy
(IMA). Our results show that the spin reversal in IMA systems is possible, but
only with a longer laser pulse and within a narrow laser parameter region. The
spin reversal does not show a strong helicity dependence where the left- and
right-circularly polarized light lead to the identical results. By contrast,
the spin reversal in PMA systems is robust, provided both the spin angular
momentum and laser field are strong enough while the magnetic anisotropy itself
is not too strong. This explains why experimentally the majority of all-optical
spin-reversal samples are found to have strong PMA and why spins in Fe
nanoparticles only cant out of plane. It is the laser-induced spin-orbit torque
that plays a key role in the spin reversal. Surprisingly, the same spin-orbit
torque results in laser-induced spin rectification in spin-mixed configuration,
a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Our results clearly point out
that PMA is essential to the spin reversal, though there is an opportunity for
in-plane spin reversal.

nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations (SRC) and nuclear symmetry energy
$E_{sym}(\rho)$ on hard photon spectra in collisions of several Ca isotopes on
$^{112}$Sn and $^{124}$Sn targets at a beam energy of 45 MeV/nucleon. It is
found that over the whole spectra of hard photons studied, effects of the SRC
overwhelm those due to the $E_{sym}(\rho)$. The energetic photons come mostly
from the high-momentum tails (HMT) of single-nucleon momentum distributions in
the target and projectile. Within the neutron-proton dominance model of SRC
based on the consideration that the tensor force acts mostly in the isosinglet
and spin-triplet nucleon-nucleon interaction channel, there are equal numbers
of neutrons and protons, thus a zero isospin-asymmetry in the HMTs. Therefore,
experimental measurements of the energetic photons from heavy-ion collisions at
Fermi energies have the great potential to help us better understand the nature
of SRC without any appreciable influence by the uncertain $E_{sym}(\rho)$.
These measurements will be complementary to but also have some advantages over
the ongoing and planned experiments using hadronic messengers from reactions
induced by high-energy electrons or protons. Since the underlying physics of
SRC and $E_{sym}(\rho)$ are closely correlated, a better understanding of the
SRC will in turn help constrain the nuclear symmetry energy more precisely in a
broad density range.

noncompact varieties the classical total homology Chern class of the tangent
bundle of a smooth compact complex manifold. The theory of CSM classes has been
extended to the equivariant setting by Ohmoto. We prove that for an arbitrary
complex projective manifold $X$, the homogenized, torus equivariant CSM class
of a constructible function $\varphi$ is the restriction of the characteristic
cycle of $\varphi$ via the zero section of the cotangent bundle of $X$. This
extends to the equivariant setting results of Ginzburg and Sabbah. We
specialize $X$ to be a (generalized) flag manifold $G/B$. In this case CSM
classes are determined by a Demazure-Lusztig (DL) operator. We prove a `Hecke
orthogonality' of CSM classes, determined by the DL operator and its
Poincar{\'e} adjoint. We further use the theory of holonomic
$\mathcal{D}_X$-modules to show that the characteristic cycle of a Verma
module, restricted to the zero section, gives the CSM class of the
corresponding Schubert cell. Since the Verma characteristic cycles naturally
identify with the Maulik and Okounkov's stable envelopes, we establish an
equivalence between CSM classes and stable envelopes; this reproves results of
Rim{\'a}nyi and Varchenko. As an application, we obtain a Segre type formula
for CSM classes. In the non-equivariant case this formula is manifestly
positive, showing that the expansion in the Schubert basis of the CSM class of
a Schubert cell is effective. This proves a previous conjecture by Aluffi and
Mihalcea, and it extends previous positivity results by J. Huh in the Grassmann
manifold case. Finally, we generalize all of this to partial flag manifolds
$G/P$.

therefore extremely predictive; moreover, recent studies singled out a Majorana
$SU(2)_\text{L}$ quintuplet as the only viable candidate. The model can be
constrained by both direct and indirect DM searches, with present time
gamma-ray line searches in the Galactic Center being particularly sensitive. It
is therefore timely to critically review this paradigm and point out possible
generalizations. We propose and explore two distinct directions. One is to
lower the cutoff of the model, which was originally fixed at the Planck scale,
to allow for decays of the DM quintuplet. We analyze the decay spectrum of this
candidate in detail and show that gamma-ray data constrain the cutoff to lie
above the GUT scale. Another possibility is to abandon the assumption of DM
electric neutrality in favor of absolutely stable, millicharged DM candidates.
We explicitly study a few examples, and find that a Dirac $SU(2)_\text{L}$

TeV scale at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), since they facilitate the
efficient reconstruction and identification of highly-boosted objects. Both for
the LHC and for future colliders, there is a growing interest in using jet
substructure methods based only on charged-particle information. The reason is
that silicon-based tracking detectors offer excellent granularity and precise
vertexing, which can improve the angular resolution on highly-collimated jets
and mitigate the impact of pileup. In this paper, we assess how much jet
substructure performance degrades by using track-only information, and we
demonstrate physics contexts in which calorimetry is most beneficial.
Specifically, we consider five different hadronic final states - W bosons, Z
bosons, top quarks, light quarks, gluons - and test the pairwise discrimination
power with a multi-variate combination of substructure observables. In the
idealized case of perfect reconstruction, we quantify the loss in
discrimination performance when using just charged particles compared to using
all detected particles. We also consider the intermediate case of using charged
particles plus photons, which provides valuable information about neutral
pions. In the more realistic case of a segmented calorimeter, we assess the
potential performance gains from improving calorimeter granularity and
resolution, comparing a CMS-like detector to more ambitious future detector
concepts. Broadly speaking, we find large performance gains from
neutral-particle information and from improved calorimetry in cases where jet
mass resolution drives the discrimination power, whereas the gains are more
modest if an absolute mass scale calibration is not required.

introduce the searcher-averaged parallel cover time (APCT) to quantify these

reduction for black-box high-fidelity models such as commercial CFD codes. The
methodology specifically addresses the situation where the high-fidelity model
may be a black-box but there is complete knowledge of the governing equations.
The main idea is that the linear operator matrix, resulting from the
discretization of the linear differential terms is approximated directly using
a suitable discretization method such as the Finite Volume Method and requires
only the computational grid as input. In this regard, the governing equations
are first cast in terms of a set of scalar observables of the state variables,
leading to a linear set of equations. By applying the snapshots of the
observables to the discrete linear operator, a right hand side vector is
obtained, providing the necessary system matrices for the Galerkin projection
step. This way an online database of ROMs are generated for various parameter
snapshots which are then interpolated online to predict the state for new
parameter instances. Finally, the reduced order model is posed as a non-linear
constrained optimization problem that can be solved at a significantly cheaper
cost compared to the full order model. The method is successfully demonstrated
on on a canonical non-linear parametric PDE with exponential non-linearity,
followed by the compressible inviscid ow past the NACA0012 airfoil. As a first
step, this paper focuses only on establishing feasibility of the method.

massive stars who lost most of their hydrogen envelope. In low metallicity
environments, such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), stellar winds are
weaker and binary interaction is expected to dominate WR-star formation.
However, the WR binary fraction appears to be ~40% at any metallicity. We use
the recently determined physical properties of the twelve known SMC WR stars to
explore their possible formation channels through comparisons with grids of SMC
models, simulated with the detailed stellar evolution code MESA. These include
models of rapidly rotating single stars, which experience (partial) chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE). We find that CHE is not able to account for the
majority of the SMC WR stars. However, the apparently single WN star SMC AB12
and the double WR system SMC AB5 (HD 5980) appear consistent with this channel.
We also analyze core helium burning stellar models assuming constant hydrogen
gradients in their envelopes. We find a dichotomy in the envelope hydrogen
gradients required to explain the observed temperatures of the SMC WR stars.
Shallow gradients are found for the WR stars with O star companions, consistent
with binary models where mass transfer occurs early, which is in agreement with
their binary properties. On the other hand, much steeper hydrogen gradients are
inferred for the group of hot apparently single WR stars. Since the hydrogen
profiles in post main sequence models of massive stars become steeper with
time, we conclude that these stars have likely been stripped by a companion
during a phase of common envelope evolution. The companions, either main
sequence stars or compact objects, are expected to still be present. A
corresponding search might identify the first immediate double black hole
binary progenitor with masses as high as those detected in GW150914.

here a generalized system where the quartic coupling constant between sites
decays as $1/d_{ij}^{\alpha}$ $(\alpha \ge 0; d_{ij} = 1,2,\dots)$. Through
{\it first-principle} molecular dynamics we demonstrate that, for large
$\alpha$ (above $\alpha \simeq 1$), i.e., short-range interactions, Boltzmann
statistics (based on the {\it additive} entropic functional $S_B[P(z)]=-k \int
dz P(z) \ln P(z)$) is verified. However, for small values of $\alpha$ (below
$\alpha \simeq 1$), i.e., long-range interactions, Boltzmann statistics
dramatically fails and is replaced by q-statistics (based on the {\it
nonadditive} entropic functional $S_q[P(z)]=k (1-\int dz [P(z)]^q)/(q-1)$, with
$S_1 = S_B$). Indeed, the one-body energy distribution is q-exponential,

the halo from the intergalactic medium. While there is abundant evidence for
the presence of a circumgalactic medium (CGM) around disk galaxies as traced by
quasar absorption lines, it has been very difficult to connect this material to
the outer gas disk. This has been a very difficult transition region to explore
because baryon tracers are hard to observe. In particular, HI disks have been
argued to truncate at a critical column density N(H) $\approx 3\times 10^{19}$
cm$^{-2}$ at 30 kpc for an L* galaxy where the gas is vulnerable to the
external ionizing background. But new deep observations of nearby L* spirals
(e.g. Milky Way, NGC 2997) suggest that HI disks may extend much further than
recognised to date, up to 60 kpc at N(H) $\approx 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. Motivated
by these observations, here we show that a clumpy outer disk of dense clouds or
cloudlets is potentially detectable to much larger radii and lower HI column
densities than previously discussed. This extended proto-disk component is
likely to explain some of the MgII forest seen in quasar spectra as judged from
absorption-line column densities and kinematics. We fully anticipate that the
armada of new radio facilities and planned HI surveys coming online will detect
this extreme outer disk (scree) material. We also propose a variant on the

nullity. The process begins with select vertices as colored, and the remaining
vertices can become colored under a specific color change rule. The goal is to
find a minimum set of vertices such that after iteratively applying the rule,
all of the vertices become colored (i.e., a minimum zero forcing set). Of
particular interest is the propagation time of a chosen set which is the number
of steps the rule must be applied in order to color all the vertices of a

  We give a purely linear algebraic interpretation of zero forcing: Find a set
of vertices $S$ such that for any weighted adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$,
whenever $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{0}$, the entirety of of $\mathbf{x}$ can be
recovered using only $\mathbf{x}_S$, the entries corresponding to $S$. The key
here is that $S$ must be chosen before $\mathbf{A}$. In this light, we are able
to give a linear algebraic interpretation of the propagation time: Any error in
$\mathbf{x}_S$ effects the error of $\mathbf{x}$ exponentially in the
propagation time. This error can be quantitatively measured using newly defined
zero forcing-related parameters, the error polynomial vector and the variance
polynomial vector. In this sense, the quality of two zero forcing sets can
objectively be compared even if the sets are the same size and their
propagation time is the same. Examples and constructions are given.

of our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most
sources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is
broader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)
circular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the
maximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,
all made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating
circular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose
that the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength
sample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly
polarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.
Circular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or
shorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about
one year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the
signal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the
sign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,
including 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees
of circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We
do find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in
synchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel

general. The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to
be faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The
polarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of
2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher
fractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales
during prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at
3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable. Most of
the sources show one or two excursions of >180 deg. on time scales from a few
weeks to about a year during the course of our observations. The 3.5 and 1.3mm
polarisation angle evolution follow rather well each other, although the 1.3mm
data show a clear preference to more prominent variability on the short time
scales, i.e. weeks. The data are compatible with multi-zone models of conical
jets involving smaller emission regions for the shortest-wavelength emitting
sites. Such smaller emitting regions should also be more efficient in
energising particle populations. The data also favours the integrated emission
at 1.3mm to have better ordered magnetic fields than the one at 3.5mm.

The most popular systems currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a
means of creating these blocks. Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every
10 minutes. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is
that the time between blocks has high variance. For example, 5% of the time,
Bitcoin's inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. This variance impedes the
consistent flow of validated transactions through the system. We propose an
alternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an
inter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called
Bobtail, generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k
lowest order statistics to a target. We show that the variance of inter-block
times decreases as k increases. If our approach were applied to Bitcoin, about
80% of blocks would be found within 7 to 12 minutes, and nearly every block
would be found within 5 to 18 minutes; the average inter-block time would
remain at 10 minutes. Further, we show that low-variance mining significantly
thwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks. For Bitcoin and Ethereum
currently (k=1), an attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with 30%
probability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 8 blocks; however, when
k>=20, the probability of success falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin
and Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 40% of the mining power will claim
about 66% of blocks; however, when k>=5, the same miner will find that selfish
mining is less successful than honest mining. The cost of our approach is a

the potential of the OSWD for bandgap engineering applications within the

relative to the dimension, i.e. $r$ is small, the regularizer does not play any
role, while for $r$'s where the regularizer starts to be felt the estimation
error is already so large as to make the whole optimization exercise pointless.
We find that the $\ell_1$ regularization can eliminate at most half the assets
from the portfolio, corresponding to this there is a critical ratio $r=2$
beyond which the $\ell_1$ regularized variance cannot be optimized: the
regularized variance becomes constant over the simplex. These facts do not seem
to have been noticed in the literature.

addition, the allowed maximum voltage between electrodes is barely limited by
the pull-in effect. The parasitic capacitance of the harvester and non-ideal
characteristics of electronic components are taken into account. A lumped-model
of the harvesting system has been implemented in a circuit simulator.
Simulation results show that an output voltage of 22 V is obtained with 0.15 g

generate much higher saturation voltage, while the minimum required initial

attention in applied science, they have been criticized as being unstable. The
objective of this study is to show that capturing the ""spatial scale"" of each

in doing so, adds flexibility. Here, the analytical properties of six SVC
models are summarized in terms of their characterization of scale. Models are
examined through a series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments to assess the
extent to which spatial scale influences model stability and the accuracy of
their SVC estimates. The following models are studied: (i) geographically
weighted regression (GWR) with a fixed distance or (ii) an adaptive distance
bandwidth (GWRa), (iii) flexible bandwidth GWR (FB-GWR) with fixed distance or
(iv) adaptive distance bandwidths (FB-GWRa), (v) eigenvector spatial filtering

designed to capture scale dependencies in local relationships (FB-GWR, FB-GWRa

most computationally efficient. Conversely GWR and ESF, where SVC estimates are
naively assumed to operate at the same spatial scale for each relationship,
perform poorly. Results also confirm that the adaptive bandwidth GWR models
(GWRa and FB-GWRa) are superior to their fixed bandwidth counterparts (GWR and

that, players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails [1]. Moreover,
by harnessing the player strategies they can outperform the most prominent
established numerical methods [1]. The aim of this manuscript is to analyze the
problem in detail and show that those claims are untenable. In fact a simple
stochastic local optimization method can easily find very good solutions to
this problem in a few 1000 trials rather than the astronomical $7.4\times

Next, counter-diabatic driving is used to generate protocols without resorting
to numeric optimization; the protocols are shown to outperform virtually all
players. The analysis moreover results in an accurate analytic estimate of the
quantum speed limit which, apart from zero-point motion, is shown to be
entirely classical in nature. The latter might explain why gamers are
remarkably good at the game.

hundred million years ago is a simple way to create Saturn's rings. A ring
parent moon with a mass comparable to Mimas could be trapped in mean motion
resonance with Enceladus and Dione in an orbit near the current outer edge of
the rings just beyond the Roche zone. I present collisional N-body simulations
of cometary impacts that lead to the partial disruption of a differentiated
moon with a rocky core and icy mantle. The core can survive largely intact
while the debris from the mantle settles into a ring of predominantly ice
particles straddling the orbital radius of the parent moon. The nascent ring
spreads radially due to collisional viscosity while mass re-accretes onto the
remnant rocky core to form a new moon that can be identified as Mimas. The icy
debris that migrates into the Roche zone evolves into Saturn's ring system.
Torques from tidal interaction with Saturn and resonant interactions with the
rings push the recently formed Mimas outward to its current position on the
same timescale of a few hundred million years. This scenario accounts for the
high ice fraction observed in Saturn's rings and explains why the ring mass is
comparable to the mass of Mimas. The prior existence of a ring parent moon in
mean motion resonance results in a tidal heating rate for Enceladus in the
recent past that is significantly larger than the current rate.

not typically work appropriately and leads to an overfitted solution. An
analysis of the expectation of the EPM's intensity function suggested that the
gamma priors for the EPM hyperparameters disturb the model shrinkage effect of
the internal $\Gamma$P. In order to ensure that the model shrinkage effect of
the EPM works in an appropriate manner, we proposed two novel generative
constructions of the EPM: CEPM incorporating constrained gamma priors, and DEPM
incorporating Dirichlet priors instead of the gamma priors. Furthermore, all
DEPM's model parameters including the infinite atoms of the $\Gamma$P prior
could be marginalized out, and thus it was possible to derive a truly infinite

  Flood Hazard",,,"10.1088/1748-9326/aacb3d",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coastal flooding drives considerable risks to many communities, but
projections of future flood risks are deeply uncertain. The paucity of
observations of extreme events often motivates the use of statistical
approaches to model the distribution of extreme storm surge events. A key deep
uncertainty that is often overlooked is model structural uncertainty. There is
currently no strong consensus among experts regarding which class of
statistical model to use as a best practice. Robust management of coastal
flooding risks requires coastal managers to consider the distinct possibility
of non-stationarity in storm surges. This increases the complexity of the
potential models to use, which tends to increase the data required to constrain
the model. Here, we use a Bayesian model averaging approach to analyze the
balance between model complexity sufficient to capture decision-relevant risks
and data availability to constrain complex model structures. We characterize
deep model structural uncertainty through a set of calibration experiments.
Specifically, we calibrate a set of models ranging in complexity using
long-term tide gauge observations from the Netherlands and the United States.
We find that in both cases, roughly half the model weight is associated with
non-stationary models. Our approach provides a formal framework to integrate
information across model structures, in light of the potentially sizable
modeling uncertainties. By combining information from multiple models, our
inference sharpens for the projected storm surge 100-year return levels, and
estimated return levels increase by several centimeters. We assess the impacts
of data availability through a set of experiments with temporal subsets and
model comparison metrics. Our analysis suggests about 70 years of data are
required to stabilize estimates of the 100-year return level, for the locations
and methods considered here.

this variability may be explained by the stellar rotation under the assumption

which is associated with the PNA. It is written in terms of the condensation
and Green's function, which is obtained with two-particle irreducible (2PI)
closed time path (CTP) effective action (EA). In the spatially flat universe
with a time-dependent scale factor, the time evolution of the PNA is computed.
We start with an initial condition where only the condensation of the neutral
scalar is non-zero. The initial condition for the fields is specified by a
density operator parameterized by the temperature of the universe. With the
above initial conditions, the PNA vanishes at the initial time and later it is
generated through the interaction between the complex scalar and the
condensation of the neutral scalar. We investigate the case that both the
interaction and the expansion rate of the universe are small and include their
effects up to the first order of the perturbation. The expanding universe
causes the effects of the dilution of the PNA, freezing interaction and the
redshift of the particle energy. As for the time dependence of the PNA, we
found that PNA oscillates at the early time and it begins to dump at the later
time. The period and the amplitude of the oscillation depend on the mass
spectrum of the model, the temperature and the expansion rate of the universe.

eigenstates of chaotic many-body Hamiltonians. The expression is a universal
function of the density of states and is valid even when the subsystem is a
finite fraction of the total system - a regime in which the reduced density
matrix is not thermal. We find that in the thermodynamic limit, only the von
Neumann entropy density is independent of the subsystem to the total system
ratio $V_A/V$, while the Renyi entropy densities depend non-linearly on
$V_A/V$. Surprisingly, Renyi entropies $S_n$ for $n > 1$ are convex functions
of the subsystem size, with a volume law coefficient that depends on $V_A/V$,
and exceeds that of a thermal mixed state at the same energy density. We
provide two different arguments to support our results: the first one relies on
a many-body version of Berry's formula for chaotic quantum mechanical systems,
and is closely related to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The second
argument relies on the assumption that for a fixed energy in a subsystem, all
states in its complement allowed by the energy conservation are equally likely.
We perform Exact Diagonalization study on quantum spin-chain Hamiltonians to

Suppose that S is a polynomial time computable permutation of the set of

matter within the framework of chiral effective field theory. We focus on the
role of three-body forces, which strongly modify the effective proton-proton
spin-singlet interaction in dense matter. We find that three-body forces
generically reduce both the size of the pairing gap and the maximum density at
which proton pairing may occur. The pairing gap is computed within BCS theory,
and model uncertainties are estimated by varying the nuclear potential and the
choice of single-particle spectrum in the gap equation. We find that a
second-order perturbative treatment of the single-particle spectrum suppresses
the proton ${}^{1}S_0$ pairing gap relative to the use of a free spectrum. We
estimate the critical temperature for the onset of proton superconductivity to
be $T_c = (3.7 - 6.0)\times 10^{9} $ K, which is consistent with previous
theoretical results in the literature and marginally within the range deduced
from a recent Bayesian analysis of neutron star cooling observations.

condensed matters when they are interacting with energetic particles or intense
laser fields. In this work, a unified and accurate theoretical formalism is
proposed on the direct multielectron processes of atoms including the multiple
Auger decay and multiple ionization by an impact of an energetic electron or a
photon based on the atomic collision theory described by a correlated many-body
Green's function. Such a practical treatment is made possible due to different
coherence features of the particles (matter waves) in the initial and final
states. We first explain how the coherence characteristics of the ejected
continuum electrons is largely destructed, by taking the electron impact direct
double ionization process as an example. This process is completely different
from the single ionization where the complete interference can be maintained.
The detailed expressions are obtained for the energy correlations among the
continuum electrons and energy resolved differential and integral cross
sections according to the separation of knock-out and shake-off mechanisms for
the electron impact direct double ionization, direct double and triple Auger
decay, and double and triple photoionization processes. The approach is applied
to investigate the electron impact double ionization processes of C$^+$, N$^+$,
and O$^+$, the direct double and triple Auger decay of the K-shell excited
states of C$^{+}$ $1s2s^22p^2$ $^2D$ and $^2P$, and the double and triple
photoionization of lithium. Comparisons with available experimental and
theoretical results show that our proposed theoretical formalism is accurate

physics of optical scattering from complex subwavelength geometry and

closely packed arrangements of nanoparticles, known as nanoparticle oligomers,
which provide an intuitive platform for analytical and numerical study on the
formation and interplay of collective resonances. I consider both plasmonic
nanoparticles, and also high-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticles that
support Mie-type electric and magnetic dipole resonances. Specific outcomes of
this study are listed as follows. (i) A new model is presented for optical Fano
resonances, which is based on interference between nonorthogonal eigenmodes of
the associated scattering object. This is demonstrated to correctly describe
Fano resonances in both plasmonic and high-refractive-index dielectric
nanoparticle oligomers. (ii) Polarisation-independent scattering and absorption
losses are shown to be enforced by n-fold discrete rotational symmetry, Cn (n

dichroism that emerges from interaction of nonorthogonal resonances is

robots with limited visibility. At each iteration, a robot takes a snapshot of
its surroundings, uses the snapshot to compute a destination point, and it
moves toward its destination. Each robot is punctiform and memoryless, it
operates in $\mathbb{R}^m$, it has a local reference system independent of the
other robots' ones, and is activated asynchronously by an adversarial
scheduler. Moreover, robots are non-rigid, in that they may be stopped by the
scheduler at each move before reaching their destination (but are guaranteed to
travel at least a fixed unknown distance before being stopped).
  We show that despite these strong limitations, it is possible to arrange
$3m+3k$ of these weak entities in $\mathbb{R}^m$ to simulate the behavior of a
stronger robot that is rigid (i.e., it always reaches its destination) and is
endowed with $k$ registers of persistent memory, each of which can store a real
number. We call this arrangement a TuringMobile. In its simplest form, a
TuringMobile consisting of only three robots can travel in the plane and store
and update a single real number. We also prove that this task is impossible
with fewer than three robots.
  Among the applications of the TuringMobile, we focused on Near-Gathering (all
robots have to gather in a small-enough disk) and Pattern Formation (of which
Gathering is a special case) with limited visibility. Interestingly, our
investigation implies that both problems are solvable in Euclidean spaces of
any dimension, even if the visibility graph of the robots is initially
disconnected, provided that a small amount of these robots are arranged to form
a TuringMobile. In the special case of the plane, a basic TuringMobile of only
three robots is sufficient.

theories of finite rank. Groups with a stably dominated generic type are shown
to have a canonical stable quotient. Abelian groups are shown to be
decomposable into a part coming from $\Gamma$, and a definable direct limit
system of groups with stably dominated generic. In the case of ACVF, among
definable subgroups of affine algebraic groups, we characterize the groups with
stably dominated generics in terms of group schemes over the valuation ring.

particles, which are predominantly captured by multiple scattering with the
electrons in a DAV, would annihilate by pairs and provide extra energy source
to the DAV. This mechanism slows down the natural cooling evolution which can
be presented by the period variation rates of pulsation modes. The differences
between the secular rates predicted by the precise asteroseismology and the
secular rates obtained from observation can reveal the DM-electron

intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of C3N is 380 W/mK at room temperature,
which is one order of magnitude lower than that of graphene (3550 W/mK at 300
K), but is greatly higher than many other typical 2D materials. The underlying
mechanisms governing the thermal transport were thoroughly discussed and
compared to graphene, including group velocities, phonon relax time, the
contribution from phonon branches, phonon anharmonicity and size effect. The
fundamental physics understood from this study may shed light on further
studies of the newly fabricated 2D crystalline C3N sheets.

problem as the maximization of a monotone set function under a matroid
constraint. We propose a randomized greedy algorithm that is significantly
faster than state-of-the-art methods. By introducing the notion of curvature
which quantifies how close a function is to being submodular, we analyze the
performance of the proposed algorithm and find a bound on the expected mean
square error (MSE) of the estimator that uses the selected sensors in terms of
the optimal MSE. Moreover, we derive a probabilistic bound on the curvature for
the scenario where{\color{black}{ the measurements are i.i.d. random vectors

dynamics takes spatial diffeomorphism invariance and spatial Weyl invariance as
the fundamental gauge symmetries associated with the gravitational field.
Despite these differences, shape dynamics and general relativity generically
predict the same dynamics---there exist gauge-fixings of each theory that
ensure agreement with the other. However, these gauge-fixing conditions are not
necessarily globally well-defined and it is therefore possible to find
solutions of the shape dynamics equations of motion that agree with general
relativity on some open neighborhoods, but which have different global
structures. In particular, the black hole solutions of the two theories
disagree globally. Understanding these novel ""shape dynamic black holes"" is the

optimal controller and estimator for linear Gaussian systems with imperfect
state information. Standard LQG assumes the set of sensor measurements, to be
fed to the estimator, to be given. However, in many problems, arising in
networked systems and robotics, one may not be able to use all the available
sensors, due to power or payload constraints, or may be interested in using the
smallest subset of sensors that guarantees the attainment of a desired control
goal. In this paper, we introduce the sensing-constrained LQG control problem,
in which one has to jointly design sensing, estimation, and control, under
given constraints on the resources spent for sensing. We focus on the realistic
case in which the sensing strategy has to be selected among a finite set of
possible sensing modalities. While the computation of the optimal sensing
strategy is intractable, we present the first scalable algorithm that computes
a near-optimal sensing strategy with provable sub-optimality guarantees. To
this end, we show that a separation principle holds, which allows the design of
sensing, estimation, and control policies in isolation. We conclude the paper
by discussing two applications of sensing-constrained LQG control, namely,
sensing-constrained formation control and resource-constrained robot
navigation.

  Anomaly Detection",,,,,"cs.SY cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A significant challenge in energy system cyber security is the current
inability to detect cyber-physical attacks targeting and originating from
distributed grid-edge devices such as photovoltaics (PV) panels, smart flexible
loads, and electric vehicles. We address this concern by designing and
developing a distributed, multi-modal anomaly detection approach that can sense
the health of the device and the electric power grid from the edge. This is
realized by exploiting unsupervised machine learning algorithms on multiple
sources of time-series data, fusing these multiple local observations and
flagging anomalies when a deviation from the normal behavior is observed.
  We particularly focus on the cyber-physical threats to the distributed PVs
that has the potential to cause local disturbances or grid instabilities by
creating supply-demand mismatch, reverse power flow conditions etc. We use an
open source power system simulation tool called GridLAB-D, loaded with real
smart home and solar datasets to simulate the smart grid scenarios and to
illustrate the impact of PV attacks on the power system. Various attacks
targeting PV panels that create voltage fluctuations, reverse power flow etc
were designed and performed. We observe that while individual unsupervised
learning algorithms such as OCSVMs, Corrupt RF and PCA surpasses in identifying
particular attack type, PCA with Convex Hull outperforms all algorithms in
identifying all designed attacks with a true positive rate of 83.64% and an
accuracy of 95.78%. Our key insight is that due to the heterogeneous nature of
the distribution grid and the uncertainty in the type of the attack being
launched, relying on single mode of information for defense can lead to
increased false alarms and missed detection rates as one can design attacks to
hide within those uncertainties and remain stealthy.

SN was monitored during the photospheric phase ($-10$ to $+$33 days with
respect to the $B$-band maximum light). The rise to maximum light and early
post-maximum decline of the light curves are slow. The peak absolute magnitude
($M_{V}$ = $-17.7\pm0.2$ mag) of ASASSN-16fp is comparable with broad-lined Ic
SN 2002ap, SN 2012ap and transitional Ic SN 2004aw but considerably fainter
than the GRB/XRF associated supernovae (e.g. SN 1998bw, 2006aj). Similar to the

photospheric phase spectral lines along with the C\,{\sc ii} features. The
expansion velocity of the ejecta near maximum light reached $\sim$16000 km
s$^{-1}$ and settled to $\sim$8000 km s$^{-1}$, $\sim$1 month post-maximum.

composition, the cognitive sciences and machine learning. They serve as base
models for composition, can simulate human prediction and provide a
multidisciplinary application domain for learning algorithms. A particularly
well established and constantly advanced subtask is the prediction of
monophonic melodies. As melodies typically involve non-Markovian dependencies
their prediction requires a capable learning algorithm. In this thesis, I apply
the recent feature discovery and learning method PULSE to the realm of symbolic
music modeling. PULSE is comprised of a feature generating operation and
L1-regularized optimization. These are used to iteratively expand and cull the
feature set, effectively exploring feature spaces that are too large for common
feature selection approaches. I design a general Python framework for PULSE,
propose task-optimized feature generating operations and various
music-theoretically motivated features that are evaluated on a standard corpus
of monophonic folk and chorale melodies. The proposed method significantly
outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models. I further discuss the free
parameters of the learning algorithm and analyze the feature composition of the
learned models. The models learned by PULSE afford an easy inspection and are
musicologically interpreted for the first time.

(1711-1765). It was presented at the public meeting of the St.Petersburg
Academy of Sciences in November 1753 and is traditionally listed among
Lomonosov's most important scientific accomplishments. In the Discourse,
Lomonosov presents an original theory of generation of electricity in the air
and lightning, many elements of which are profoundly correct even by present
day understanding of the phenomenon. The theory is based on experimental
observations and measurements and supported by some mathematical estimates. The
basis of the Lomonosov theory is the idea of vertical air movements as the main
cause of atmospheric electricity - the immersion of the cold upper strata of
the atmosphere into the lower (warmer) layers causes mechanical friction of
miniscular particles in the air against each other, that results in generation
of atmospheric electricity. Miniscular particles of two types are required:
those of water (vapors) capable of accumulation of the electricity, and organic
compounds/fatty particles in the air which are involved in production of the
electricity via friction. Electrically charged droplets are assumed to be
spread throughout the entire volume of the cloud. The transfer of charges from
individual fatty particles to droplets of water in the clouds via countless
collisions leads to formation in atmosphere, in clouds of strong electric
fields, which are the cause of the appearance of lightning. At the end of
Discourse Lomonosov suggests explanations of the Northern lights (aurora
borealis) and comet tails as purely electrical phenomena originating from the
down- and updrafts in the atmospheres, like in his theory of lightning,and
expanding beyond them into the surrounding ether.

(two axially symmetric electric quadrupoles, an electric dipole, and a magnetic
quadrupole), and the interference of these modes can ensure directivity of the
nonlinear scattering. The developed multipolar analysis can be instructive for
interpreting the far-field measurements of the nonlinear scattering, and it

risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end

quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift
decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced
regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to
understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and
outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong
functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have
larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors
in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift
requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by
certain specific developers.

semantically parsing documents in specific domains. Basically, OONP reads a
document and parses it into a predesigned object-oriented data structure
(referred to as ontology in this paper) that reflects the domain-specific
semantics of the document. An OONP parser models semantic parsing as a decision
process: a neural net-based Reader sequentially goes through the document, and
during the process it builds and updates an intermediate ontology to summarize
its partial understanding of the text it covers. OONP supports a rich family of
operations (both symbolic and differentiable) for composing the ontology, and a
big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for representing the
state and the document. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of
different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL) ,
reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid of the two. Our experiments on both
synthetic and real-world document parsing tasks have shown that OONP can learn
to handle fairly complicated ontology with training data of modest sizes.

several detections of long-lived bright atmospheric features that have also
been observed by large telescopes such as Keck II or Hubble. The combination of
both types of images allows the study of the long term evolution of major cloud
systems in the planet. In 2013 and 2014 two bright features were present on the
planet at southern mid latitudes. These may have merged in late 2014, possibly
leading to the formation of a single bright feature observed during 2015 at the
same latitude. This cloud system was first observed in January 2015 and nearly
continuously from July to December 2015 in observations with telescopes in the
2 to 10 meter class and in images from amateur astronomers. These images show
the bright spot as a compact feature at 40.1 deg South planetographic latitude
well resolved from a nearby bright zonal band that extended from 42 deg South
to 20 deg South. Tracking its motion from July to November 2015 suggests a
longitudinal oscillation of 16 deg in amplitude with a 90 day period, typical
of dark spots on Neptune and similar to the Great Red Spot oscillation in
Jupiter. The limited time covered by high-resolution observations only covers
one full oscillation and other interpretations of the changing motions could be
possible. HST images in September 2015 show the presence of a dark spot at
short wavelengths in the southern flank of the bright cloud observed throughout
2015.

different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in
a contact network or the spread of rumors in an online social network. We study

agnostic about the topology of the network and the nature of the spreading

regression and information theory we classify the observed spectra in an
objective, robust and unbiased way into five morphological classes: simple or
broken power law, power law with either low or high-frequency cut-off and
log-parabolic spectrum. While about $79 \%$ of the pulsars that could be
classified have simple power law spectra, we find significant deviations in 73
pulsars, 35 of which have curved spectra, 25 with a spectral break and 10 with
a low-frequency turn-over. We identify 11 gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS)
pulsars, with 3 newly identified in this work and 8 confirmations of known GPS
pulsars; 3 others show tentative evidence of GPS, but require further
low-frequency measurements to support this classification. The weighted mean
spectral index of all pulsars with simple power law spectra is $-1.60 \pm
0.03$. The observed spectral indices are well described by a shifted log-normal
distribution. The strongest correlations of spectral index are with spin-down
luminosity, magnetic field at the light-cylinder and spin-down rate. We also
investigate the physical origin of the observed spectral features and determine
emission altitudes for three pulsars.

for each $G \in \mathcal{G}_k$ and each (sufficiently large) $V \subseteq
V(G)$, the partial matching width of $V$ is $\Omega(k \log |V|)$.
  We use the above lower bound to establish a lower bound on the size of
non-deterministic read-once branching programs (NROBPs). In particular, for
each sufficiently large ineteger $k$, we introduce a class ${\bf \Phi}_k$ of
CNFs of (primal graph) treewidth at most $k$ such that for any $\varphi \in
{\bf \Phi}_k$ and any Boolean function $F \subseteq \varphi$ and such that
$|\varphi|/|F| \leq 2^{\sqrt{n}}$ (here the functions are regarded as sets of

$n^{\Omega(k)}$. This result significantly generalises an earlier result of the
author showing a non-FPT lower bound for NROBPs representing CNFs of bounded
treewidth. Intuitively, we show that not only those CNFs but also their
arbitrary one side approximations with an exponential ratio still attain that
lower bound.
  The non-trivial aspect of this approximation is that due to a small number of
satisfying assignments for $F$, it seems difficult to establish a large
bottleneck: the whole function can `sneak' through a single rectangle
corresponding to just \emph{one} vertex of the purported bottleneck. We
overcome this problem by simultaneously exploring $\sqrt{n}$ bottlenecks and
showing that at least one of them must be large. This approach might be useful
for establishing other lower bounds for branching programs.

previous studies have shown that the DAPI controller performs well, in

minimize the distance between the model and the empirical distribution in terms
of a different metric, but thereby introduce a Lipschitz constraint into the
optimization problem. A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the
class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight
clipping. It was proposed that training can be improved by instead augmenting
the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient
of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one. We present
theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the
Lipschitz constraint is preferable. These arguments are supported by
experimental results on toy data sets.

assumptions on the resolvent growth of the semigroup generator. Our main
results show that one obtains the best possible estimate on the rate of decay,
that is to say an upper bound which is also known to be a lower bound, under a
comparatively mild assumption on the growth behaviour. This extends several
statements obtained by Batty, Chill and Tomilov (J. Eur. Math. Soc., vol.
18(4), pp. 853-929, 2016). In fact, for a large class of semigroups our
condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for this optimal estimate
to hold. Even without this assumption we obtain a new quantified asymptotic
result which in many cases of interest gives a sharper estimate for the rate of
decay than was previously available, and for semigroups of normal operators we
are able to describe the asymptotic behaviour exactly. We illustrate the
strength of our theoretical results by using them to obtain sharp estimates on
the rate of energy decay for a wave equation subject to viscoelastic damping at
the boundary.

changes direction and the waves induce a reaction force on the vortex. We study
experimentally the resulting vortex distortion. Incoming surface gravity waves
impinge on a steady vortex of velocity $U_0$ driven magneto-hydrodynamically at
the bottom of a fluid layer. The waves induce a shift of the vortex center in
the direction transverse to wave propagation, together with a decrease in
surface vorticity. We interpret these two phenomena in the framework introduced
by Craik and Leibovich (1976): we identify the dimensionless Stokes drift
$S=U_s/U_0$ as the relevant control parameter, $U_s$ being the Stokes drift
velocity of the waves. We propose a simple vortex line model which indicates
that the shift of the vortex center originates from a balance between vorticity
advection by the Stokes drift and self-advection of the vortex. The decrease in
surface vorticity is interpreted as a consequence of vorticity expulsion by the
fast Stokes drift, which confines it at depth. This purely hydrodynamic process
is analogous to the magnetohydrodynamic expulsion of magnetic field by a
rapidly moving conductor through the electromagnetic skin effect. We study
vorticity expulsion in the limit of fast Stokes drift and deduce that the
surface vorticity decreases as $1/S$, a prediction which is compatible with the
experimental data. Such wave-induced vortex distortions have important
consequences for the nonlinear regime of wave refraction: the refraction angle
rapidly decreases with wave intensity.

x-ray spectra with energies infinitesimally below and above the contrast
material K-edge energy. The A-space method uses a broad spectrum x-ray tube
source and measures the transmitted spectrum with photon counting detectors
with pulse height analysis. The methods are compared by their signal to noise

  To tackle this problem, we follow an information theoretic approach based on
Kolmogorov complexity and use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to
provide a practical solution. In particular, we propose a compression scheme to
encode local and global functional relations using MDL-based regression. We
infer $X$ causes $Y$ in case it is shorter to describe $Y$ as a function of $X$

presentability results. Finally, we consider the case where a subact $B$ has
finite complement in an $M$-act $A$. We show that if $M$ is a finitely

measurement of photospheric magnetic field strength. It was devised for the
neutral iron line pair at 5247.1 A and 5250.2 A (5250 A pair). Other line pairs
as well-suited as this pair been have not been reported in the literature. The
aim of the present work is to identify new line pairs useful for the MLR
technique and to test their reliability. We use a three dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation representing the quiet Sun atmosphere to
synthesize the Stokes profiles. Then, we apply the MLR technique to the Stokes
V profiles to recover the fields in the MHD cube both, at original resolution
and after degrading with a point spread function. In both these cases, we aim
to empirically represent the field strengths returned by the MLR method in
terms of the field strengths in the MHD cube. We have identified two new line
pairs that are very well adapted to be used for MLR measurements. The first
pair is in the visible, Fe I 6820 A - 6842 A (whose intensity profiles have
earlier been used to measure stellar magnetic fields), and the other is in the
infrared (IR), Fe I 15534 A - 15542 A. The lines in these pairs reproduce the
magnetic fields in the MHD cube rather well, partially better than the original
5250 A pair. The newly identified line pairs complement the old pairs. The
lines in the new IR pair, due to their higher Zeeman sensitivity, are ideal for
the measurement of weak fields. The new visible pair works best above 300 G.
The new IR pair, due to its large Stokes V signal samples more fields in the
MHD cube than the old IR pair at $1.56\,\mu$m, even in the presence of noise,
and hence likely also on the real Sun. Owing to their low formation heights
(100-200 km above tau_5000=1), both the new line pairs are well suited for
probing magnetic fields in the lower photosphere.

nm and identified a blue enhancement in the dust coma in the sunward direction
within 5 km from the nucleus, which we interpret as a localized enrichment in
water ice. OH column density maps show an anti-sunward enhancement throughout
the encounter except for the highest resolution images, acquired at CA, where a
radial jet becomes visible in the innermost coma, extending up to 12 km from
the nucleus. The OH distribution in the inner coma is very different from that
expected for a fragment species. Instead, it correlates well with the water
vapor map derived by the HRI-IR instrument onboard Deep Impact
\citep{AHearn2011}. Radial profiles of the OH column density and derived water
production rates show an excess of OH emission during CA that cannot be
explained with pure fluorescence. We attribute this excess to a prompt emission
process where photodissociation of H$_2$O directly produces excited
OH*($A^2\it{\Sigma}^+$) radicals. Our observations provide the first direct
imaging of Near-UV prompt emission of OH. We therefore suggest the use of a

in the steady state of a spin chain coupled to a tailored bath. We consider a
dissipation which, in contrast to disorder, tends to generate a homogeneously
polarized steady state. We find that the steady state can be highly sensitive
even to weak disorder. We also establish that, in the presence of such
dissipation, even in the absence of interaction, a finite amount of disorder is
needed for localization. Last, we show that for strong disorder the system
reveals signatures of localization both in the weakly and strongly interacting

gravity. The computations are carried out for the Kerr black hole and for the

singularity on a surface at a finite radius. For the Kerr metric, a few
interesting possibilities of gyroscope precession frequency, as measured by a
Copernican observer outside the ergoregion, are pointed out. It is shown that
for certain angular velocities of a stationary observer, this frequency might
vanish exactly, close to the ergoregion. Similar computations are repeated for
static observers in the naked singularity background, and strong enhancement of
the Lense-Thirring precession frequency compared to the black hole case is
established. Then, we study the nature of tidal forces in the rotating naked
singularity background, in Fermi normal coordinates. Here, physical quantities
characterizing tidal disruptions of celestial objects in equatorial circular
orbits are computed numerically. Our results here indicate that there might be
significant deviations from corresponding Kerr black hole calculations, up to
the level of approximation that we consider.

existence of a positively invariant bounded region are proved. It is shown that
the considered four-dimensional system has at least one equilibrium state and a
detailed local stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis is given. Numerical
results reveal the fact that an appropriate choice of the system's parameters
leads to the coexistence of two asymptotically stable equilibria in the
non-delayed case. When the total average time delay of the system is large
enough, the coexistence of two stable limit cycles is revealed, which
successfully model the ultradian rhythm of the HPA axis both in a normal
disease-free situation and in a diseased hypocortisolim state, respectively.

the regime where photon advection dominates over photon generation. For this
purpose, a novel iterative method for deriving a self-consistent steady-state
structure of RRMS is developed, based on a Monte-Carlo code that solves the
transfer of photons subject to Compton scattering and pair
production/annihilation. Systematic study is performed by imposing various
upstream conditions which are characterized by the following three parameters:
the photon-to-baryon inertia ratio $\xi_{u *}$, the photon-to-baryon number
ratio $\tilde{n}$, and the shock Lorentz factor $\gamma_u$. We find that the
properties of RRMSs vary considerably with these parameters. In particular,
while a smooth decline in the velocity, accompanied by a gradual temperature
increase is seen for $\xi_{u*} \gg 1$, an efficient bulk Comptonization, that
leads to a heating precursor, is found for $\xi_{u*} \lesssim 1$. As a
consequence, although particle acceleration is highly inefficient in these
shocks, a broad non-thermal spectrum is produced in the latter case. The
generation of high energy photons through bulk Comptonization leads, in certain
cases, to a copious production of pairs that provide the dominant opacity for
Compton scattering. We also find that for certain upstream conditions a weak
subshock appears within the flow. For a choice of parameters suitable to
gamma-ray bursts, the radiation spectrum within the shock is found to be
compatible with that of the prompt emission, suggesting that subphotospheric

hole (SMBH) in the S0 galaxy NGC 307, using adaptive-optics IFU data from
VLT-SINFONI. We investigate the effects of including dark-matter haloes as well
as multiple stellar components with different mass-to-light (M/L) ratios in the
dynamical modeling. Models with no halo and a single stellar component yield a
relatively poor fit with a low value for the SMBH mass ($7.0 \pm 1.0 \times
10^{7} M_{\odot}$) and a high stellar M/L ratio (K-band M/L = $1.3 \pm 0.1$).
Adding a halo produces a much better fit, with a significantly larger SMBH mass
($2.0 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$) and a lower M/L ratio ($1.1 \pm 0.1$).
A model with no halo but with separate bulge and disc components produces a
similarly good fit, with a slightly larger SMBH mass ($3.0 \pm 0.5 \times
10^{8} M_{\odot}$) and an identical M/L ratio for the bulge component, though
the disc M/L ratio is biased high (disc M/L $ = 1.9 \pm 0.1$). Adding a halo to
the two-stellar-component model results in a much more plausible disc M/L ratio
of $1.0 \pm 0.1$, but has only a modest effect on the SMBH mass ($2.2 \pm 0.6
\times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$) and leaves the bulge M/L ratio unchanged. This
suggests that measuring SMBH masses in disc galaxies using just a single
stellar component and no halo has the same drawbacks as it does for elliptical
galaxies, but also that reasonably accurate SMBH masses and bulge M/L ratios
can be recovered (without the added computational expense of modeling haloes)
by using separate bulge and disc components.

an expansion in the tunneling strength, we calculate the conductance through
the barrier as a function of the temperature as well as the local density of

bound-state mediated tunneling. The characteristic feature of the topological
phase is the emergence of protected zero-energy bound states with fractional
spin located at the impurity position. By flipping the fractional spin the edge
states can absorb or emit spinons and thus enable single electron tunneling
across the impurity even though the bulk spectrum for these excitations is
gapped. This results in a finite LDOS below the bulk gap and in a non-monotonic
behavior of the conductance. The system represents an important physical
example of an interacting symmetry-protected topological phase---which combines
features of a topological spin insulator and a topological charge metal---in

Tewari et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 035420 (2016)], where a robust coherence
recovery from a certain energy was detected for an electron injected into the
quantum Hall edge at the filling factor 2. After passing through a quantum dot
the electron then tunnels into the edge with a subsequent propagation towards a
symmetric Mach-Zender interferometer, after which the visibility of
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations is measured. According to conventional
understanding its decay with the increasing energy of the injected electron was
expected, which was confirmed theoretically in the bosonization framework. Here
we analyze why such a model fails to account for the coherence recovery and
show that the reason is essentially the destructive interference of the two
quasiparticles (charge and neutral modes) forming at the edge out of the
incoming electron. This statement is robust with respect to the strength of
Coulomb interaction. We firstly exploit the idea of introducing an imbalance
between the quasiparticles, by creating different conditions of propagation for
them. It can be done by taking into account either dispersion or dissipation,
which indeed results in the partial coherence recovery. The idea of imbalance
can also be realized by applying a periodic potential to the arms of
interferometer. We discuss such an experiment, which might also shed light on
the internal coherence of the two edge excitations. Another scenario relies on
the lowering of the energy density of the electron wave packet by the time it
arrives at the interferometer in presence of dissipation or dispersion. This
energy density is defined by a certain parameter, which is completely
independent of the injected energy, which naturally explains the emergence of a
threshold energy in the experiment.

manipulation of spins. We show that spin-orbit effects related to the GaAs band

dependence of the Zeeman splitting on predominantly the out-of-plane quantum

the gravitationally lensed quasar system PS J0630-1201. The lens was discovered
by matching a photometric quasar catalogue compiled from Pan-STARRS and WISE
photometry to the Gaia DR1 catalogue, exploiting the high spatial resolution of
the latter (FWHM $\sim $0.1"") to identify the three brightest components of the
lens. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the WHT confirm the multiple
objects are quasars at redshift $z_{q}=3.34$. Further follow-up with Keck AO
high-resolution imaging reveals that the system is composed of two lensing
galaxies and the quasar is lensed into a $\sim$2.8"" separation four-image cusp
configuration with a fifth image clearly visible, and a 1.0"" arc due to the
lensed quasar host galaxy. The system is well-modelled with two singular
isothermal ellipsoids, reproducing the position of the fifth image. We discuss
future prospects for measuring time delays between the images and constraining
any offset between mass and light using the faintly detected Einstein arcs
associated with the quasar host galaxy.

identification and cataloguing of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed
quasars. We investigate a sample of 49 known lensed quasars in the SDSS
footprint, with image separations less than 2$^{\prime\prime}$, and find that 8
are detected with multiple components in the first Gaia data release. In the
case of the 41 single Gaia detections, we generally are able to distinguish
these lensed quasars from single quasars when comparing Gaia flux and position
measurements to those of Pan-STARRS and SDSS. This is because the multiple
images of these lensed quasars are typically blended in ground-based imaging
and therefore the total flux and a flux-weighted centroid are measured, which
can differ significantly from the fluxes and centroids of the individual
components detected by Gaia. We compare the fluxes through an empirical fit of
Pan-STARRS griz photometry to the wide optical Gaia bandpass values using a
sample of isolated quasars. The positional offsets are calculated from a
recalibrated astrometric SDSS catalogue. Applying flux and centroid difference
criteria to spectroscopically confirmed quasars, we discover 4 new
sub-arcsecond-separation lensed quasar candidates which have two distinct
components of similar colour in archival CFHT or HSC data. Our method based on
single Gaia detections can be used to identify the $\sim$ 1400 lensed quasars
with image separation above 0.5$^{\prime\prime}$, expected to have only one
image bright enough to be detected by Gaia.

spatial redistribution of the photoexcited carriers in microcavities with
massive GaAs spacers leads to an enhanced coupling to the fundamental 20 GHz
vertically polarized mechanical breathing mode. The carrier diffusion along the
growth axis of the device can be enhanced by increasing the laser power, or
limited by embedding GaAs quantum wells in the cavity spacer, a strategy used
here to prove and engineer the optoelectronic forces in phonon generation with
real carriers. The wavelength dependence of the observed phenomena provide
further proof of the role of optoelectronic forces. The optical forces
associated to the different intervening mechanisms and their relevance for

Ashtekar-Barbero variables. These variables, defined in a gauge-fixing of the
theory, correspond to a parametrization of the solutions of the so-called
simplicity constraints. Their geometrical interpretation is however
unsatisfactory as they do not constitute a space-time connection. It would be
possible to resolve this point by using a full Lorentz connection or,
equivalently, by using the self-dual Ashtekar variables. This leads however to
simplicity constraints or reality conditions which are notoriously difficult to
implement in the quantum theory.
  We explore in this paper the possibility of imposing such constraints at the
quantum level in the context of canonical quantization. To do so, we define a
simpler model, in 3d, with similar constraints by extending the phase space to
include an independent vielbein. We define the classical model and show that a
precise quantum theory by gauge-unfixing can be defined out of it, completely
equivalent to the standard 3d euclidean quantum gravity.

a stepping stone to define full-fledged covariant Loop Quantum Gravity.

For driving the SPE, spin currents are generated via the spin Hall effect from
applied charge currents in the Pt layer, and injected into the adjacent thick
YIG film. The resultant temperature modulation is detected by a commonly-used
thermocouple attached to the Pt/YIG junction. The output of the thermocouple
shows sign reversal when the magnetization is reversed and linearly increases
with the applied current, demonstrating the detection of the SPE signal. We
found that the SPE signal decreases with the magnetic field. The observed

magnons in the SPE as in the SSE.

synchronization errors. As a benefit, we are able to relax standard
requirements. E.g., agents are allowed to participate in the network even when
they usually cannot synchronize exactly. In addition, OSS enables agents to
save input-energy by synchronizing within tolerable error-bounds. Our new
method combines the synchronization of bounded exosystems with local
infinite-time linear quadratic tracking (LQT). This results in an optimal
balance of each agent's synchronization error versus its consumed input-energy.
Moreover, we extend recent results in LQT such that the derived time-invariant
optimal control guarantees that the synchronization error satisfies given
strict bounds. All these aspects are demonstrated by an illustrative simulation
example with a detailed analysis.

to sequentially test and localize the association with the outcome. In some
cases, the results for summary measures are significant, but subsequent tests
used to localize differences are underpowered and do not identify regions
associated with the outcome. Here, we propose a generalization of Rao's score
test based on projecting the score statistic onto a linear subspace of a

signal in the high-dimensional space by projecting the scores to the subspace
where the score test was performed. This allows for inference in the
high-dimensional space to be performed on the same degrees of freedom as the
score test, effectively reducing the number of comparisons. Simulation results
demonstrate the test has competitive power relative to others commonly used. We

channels. We fix the pion-baryon vertices in the underlying quark model while
the $s$-wave sigma-baryon interaction is introduced phenomenologically with the
coupling strength, the mass and the width of the $\sigma$ meson as free
parameters. The Laurent-Pietarinen expansion is used to extract the information
about the $S$-matrix pole. The Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the $K$ matrix
with a separable kernel is solved to all orders. For sufficiently strong
$\sigma NN$ coupling the kernel becomes singular and a quasi-bound state
emerges at around 1.4~GeV, dominated by the $\sigma N$ component and reflecting
itself in a pole of the $S$-matrix. The alternative mechanism involving a
$(1s)^22s$ quark resonant state is added to the model and the interplay of the
dynamically generated state and the three-quark resonant state is studied. It
turns out that for the mass of the three-quark resonant state above 1.6~GeV the
mass of the resonance is determined solely by the dynamically generated state,

reproduce the experimental width and the modulus of the resonance pole.

in disk-integrated EUV irradiance observations during a solar flare. A wavelet
analysis of detrended Lyman-alpha (from GOES/EUVS) and Lyman continuum (from
SDO/EVE) emission from the 2011 February 15 X-class flare (SOL2011-02-15T01:56)
revealed a $\sim$3-minute period present during the flare's main phase. The
formation temperature of this emission locates this radiation to the flare's
chromospheric footpoints, and similar behaviour is found in the SDO/AIA
1600\AA\ and 1700\AA\ channels, which are dominated by chromospheric continuum.
The implication is that the chromosphere responds dynamically at its acoustic
cutoff frequency to an impulsive injection of energy. Since the 3-minute period
was not found at hard X-ray energies (50-100 keV) in RHESSI data we can state
that this 3-minute oscillation does not depend on the rate of energization of
non-thermal electrons. However, a second period of 120 s found in both hard
X-ray and chromospheric emission is consistent with episodic electron
energization on 2-minute timescales. Our finding on the 3-minute oscillation
suggests that chromospheric mechanical energy should be included in the flare
energy budget, and the fluctuations in the Lyman-alpha line may influence the
composition and dynamics of planetary atmospheres during periods of high
activity.

conjecture has been verified only for stars, by Grzesik, Mikala\v{c}ki, Nagy,
Naor, Patkos and Skerman.
  We show that the conjecture holds for every connected graph $H$ with at most
one cycle (and at least two edges), with a polynomial separation between the
lower and upper thresholds. We also prove an upper bound for the lower
threshold of any graph $H$ with at least two edges, and show that this bound is
tight for all graphs in which each connected component contains at most one
cycle. Along the way, we establish number-theoretic tools that might be useful
for other problems of this type.

March 2016 and Johns Hopkins in June 2017, we report on the recent advances in
theory, instrumentation and observation that were presented in these meetings
and some of the opportunities and challenges that were identified looking
forward. With preliminary detections of CO, [CII], Lya and low-redshift 21cm,
and a host of experiments set to go online in the next few years, the field is
rapidly progressing on all fronts, with great anticipation for a flood of new
exciting results. This current snapshot provides an efficient reference for
experts in related fields and a useful resource for nonspecialists. We begin by
introducing the concept of line-intensity mapping and then discuss the broad
array of science goals that will be enabled, ranging from the history of star
formation, reionization and galaxy evolution to measuring baryon acoustic
oscillations at high redshift and constraining theories of dark matter,
modified gravity and dark energy. After reviewing the first detections reported
to date, we survey the experimental landscape, presenting the parameters and
capabilities of relevant instruments such as COMAP, mmIMe, AIM-CO, CCAT-p,
TIME, CONCERTO, CHIME, HIRAX, HERA, STARFIRE, MeerKAT/SKA and SPHEREx. Finally,
we describe recent theoretical advances: different approaches to modeling line
luminosity functions, several techniques to separate the desired signal from
foregrounds, statistical methods to analyze the data, and frameworks to
generate realistic intensity map simulations.

suitable for both the sit-and-stare and raster-scan spectra. In this work, the
geometric distortions of the spectra are firstly corrected for subsequent

lines in the flat-field, the original flat-field matrix is split into four
independent components for ensuring a high precision flat-fielding correction,
consisting of the continuum gradient matrix, slit non-uniform matrix, CCD dust

and intensity fluctuations of the science data are further corrected. After
precise reduction with this procedure, the measuring accuracies of the Doppler
velocities for different spectral lines and of the oscillation curves of the
chromosphere and photosphere are measured. The results show that the highest
measuring accuracy of the Doppler velocity is within 100 ms-1, which indicates
that the characteristics of the photosphere and chromosphere can be studied
co-spatially and co-temporally with the reduced spectra of NVST.

such scalars may be relevant. The highly-nonlinear nature of screening
mechanisms means that they evade classical fifth-force searches, and there has
been an intense effort towards designing new and novel tests to probe them,
both in the laboratory and using astrophysical objects, and by reinterpreting
existing datasets. The results of these searches are often presented using
different parametrizations, which can make it difficult to compare constraints
coming from different probes. The purpose of this review is to summarize the
present state-of-the-art searches for screened scalars coupled to matter, and
to translate the current bounds into a single parametrization to survey the
state of the models. Presently, commonly studied chameleon models are
well-constrained but less commonly studied models have large regions of
parameter space that are still viable. Symmetron models are constrained well by
astrophysical and laboratory tests, but there is a desert separating the two
scales where the model is unconstrained. The coupling of chameleons to photons
is tightly constrained but the symmetron coupling has yet to be explored. We
also summarize the current bounds on $f(R)$ models that exhibit the chameleon
mechanism (Hu \& Sawicki models). The simplest of these are well constrained by

  Notices",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper establishes the global existence and regularity for a system of
the two-dimensional (2D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only
directional hyperresistivity. More precisely, the equation of $b_1$ (the
horizontal component of the magnetic field) involves only vertical
hyperdiffusion (given by $\Lambda_2^{2\beta} b_1$) while the equation of $b_2$
(the vertical component) has only horizontal hyperdiffusion (given by
$\Lambda_1^{2\beta} b_2$), where $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ are directional
Fourier multiplier operators with the symbols being $|\xi_1|$ and $|\xi_2|$,
respectively. We prove that, for $\beta>1$, this system always possesses a
unique global-in-time classical solution when the initial data is sufficiently
smooth. The model concerned here is rooted in the MHD equations with only
magnetic diffusion, which play a significant role in the study of magnetic
reconnection and magnetic turbulence. In certain physical regimes and under
suitable scaling, the magnetic diffusion becomes partial (given by part of the
Laplacian operator). There have been considerable recent developments on the
fundamental issue of whether classical solutions of these equations remain
smooth for all time. The papers of Cao-Wu-Yuan \cite{CaoWuYuan} and of Jiu-Zhao
\cite{JiuZhao2} obtained the global regularity when the magnetic diffusion is
given by the full fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^\beta$ with $\beta>1$. The
main result presented in this paper requires only directional fractional
diffusion and yet we prove the regularization in all directions. The proof
makes use of a key observation on the structure of the nonlinearity in the MHD
equations and technical tools on Fourier multiplier operators such as the
H\""{o}rmander-Mikhlin multiplier theorem. The result presented here appears to
be the sharpest for the 2D MHD equations with partial magnetic diffusion.

FreeSurfer and FIRST. On the IBSR 18 dataset, our method also exhibits a

nearly mutually orthogonal, we observe both real and imaginary weak value
amplifications manifested as spectacular shift of the peak frequency of Fano
resonance and narrowing (or broadening) of the resonance line width,
respectively. Weak value amplification using asymmetric Fano spectral response
broadens the domain of applicability of weak measurements using natural

al.}, Phys. Fluids \textbf{28}, 013305 (2016)) that for inertial particles in
2D turbulence, the nature of the irreversibility of the particle-pair
dispersion inverts when the particle inertia exceeds a certain value. In
particular, when the particle Stokes number, ${\rm St}$, is below a certain
value, the forward-in-time (FIT) dispersion should be faster than the
backward-in-time (BIT) dispersion, but for ${\rm St}$ above this value, this
should invert so that BIT becomes faster than FIT dispersion. This non-trivial
behavior arises because of the competition between two physically distinct
irreversibility mechanisms that operate in different regimes of ${\rm St}$. In
3D turbulence, both mechanisms act to produce faster BIT than FIT dispersion,
but in 2D turbulence, the two mechanisms have opposite effects because of the
flux of energy from the small to the large scales. We supplement the
qualitative argument given by Bragg \emph{et al.} (Phys. Fluids \textbf{28},

time limit. We confirm the theoretical predictions using results of inertial
particle dispersion in a direct numerical simulation of 2D turbulence. A more
general finding of this analysis is that in turbulent flows with an inverse
energy flux, inertial particles may yet exhibit a net downscale flux of kinetic
energy because of their non-local in-time dynamics.

can segregate into slower and faster ones depending on the relative difference
in velocity of the 2 type of swimmers. We also observe that contribution of
slower swimmers towards clustering, on an average, is much larger compared to
faster ones, although we employ a homogeneous mixture. When the difference in
velocity is large between the swimmers, the faster ones move away from the
slower ones towards the boundary. On the other hand, when the relative
difference in velocity is very small, the slower and faster swimmer mix
together to form big clusters. At later time even for small difference in

patterns during atrial fibrillation (AF) with respect to normal sinus rhythm
(NSR). AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia with faster and irregular
beating, has been recently and independently associated with the increased risk
of dementia. However, the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms relating the two
pathologies remain mainly undetermined so far; thus the contribution of
modeling and refined statistical tools is valuable. Pressure and flow rate
temporal series in NSR and AF are here evaluated along representative cerebral
sites (from carotid arteries to capillary brain circulation), exploiting
reliable artificially built signals recently obtained from an in silico
approach. The complex network analysis evidences, in a synthetic and original
way, a dramatic signal variation towards the distal/capillary cerebral regions
during AF, which has no counterpart in NSR conditions. At the large artery
level, networks obtained from both AF and NSR hemodynamic signals exhibit
elongated and chained features, which are typical of pseudo-periodic series.
These aspects are almost completely lost towards the microcirculation during
AF, where the networks are topologically more circular and present random-like
characteristics. As a consequence, all the physiological phenomena at
microcerebral level ruled by periodicity - such as regular perfusion, mean
pressure per beat, and average nutrient supply at cellular level - can be
strongly compromised, since the AF hemodynamic signals assume irregular
behaviour and random-like features. Through a powerful approach which is
complementary to the classical statistical tools, the present findings further
strengthen the potential link between AF hemodynamic and cognitive decline.

with a $0.2""$ angular resolution. We present the observations of Field 1 of our
survey, centred approximately on SgrA* with an approximate size of
$7.95'\times3.43'$. We describe the observational set-up and data reduction
pipeline and discuss the quality of the data. Finally, we present some
preliminary analysis of the data. The data were acquired with the near-infrared
camera HAWK-I at the ESO VLT. Short readout times in combination with the
speckle holography algorithm allowed us to produce final images with a stable,
Gaussian PSF of $0.2""$ FWHM. Astrometric calibration is achieved via the VVV
survey and photometric calibration is based on the SIRIUS/IRSF survey. The
quality of the data is assessed by comparison between observations of the same
field with different detectors of HAWK-I and at different times. We reach 5
sigma detection limits of approximately $J=22$, $H=21$, and $K_s=20$. The
photometric uncertainties are less than 0.05 at $J<20$, $H<17$ and $K_s<16$. We
distinguish five stellar populations in the colour-magnitude diagrams; three of
them appear to belong to foreground spiral arms, and the other two correspond
to a high- and a low-extinction star groups at the Galactic Centre. We use our
data to analyse the near-infrared extinction curve and conclude that it can be
described very well by a power-law with an index of $JHK_s=2.30\pm0.08$. We do
not find any evidence that this index depends on the position along the
line-of-sight, or on the absolute value of the extinction. We produce
extinction maps that show the clumpiness of the ISM at the Galactic Centre.
Finally, we estimate that the majority of the stars have solar or super-solar
metallicity.

inclusion of higher-derivative terms in the scalar propagator. Such terms give
rise to Ostrogradski ghosts which signal an instability of the system and are
therefore dangerous for the consistency of the theory. Since it is expected
that such terms are generated dynamically by the renormalization group flow
they provide a potential threat when constructing a theory of quantum gravity
based on Asymptotic Safety. Our work then establishes the following picture:
upon incorporating higher-derivative terms in the scalar propagator the flow of
the gravity-matter system possesses a fixed point structure suitable for
Asymptotic Safety. This structure includes an interacting renormalization group
fixed point where the Ostrogradski ghosts acquire an infinite mass and decouple
from the system. Tracing the flow towards the infrared it is found that there
is a subset of complete renormalization group trajectories which lead to stable
renormalized propagators. This subset is in one-to-one correspondence to the
complete renormalization group trajectories obtained in computations which do
not track of the higher-derivative terms. Thus our asymptotically safe

Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering
structure by checking at different points and for different scales on departure
from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering
structure in terms of weights \( w_{ij} \) each of them measures the degree of
local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of
""no gap"" between them. % The procedure starts from very local scale, then the
parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully
adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their
structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the
procedure is able to recover different clusters with sharp edges or manifold
structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive
numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various
artificial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states
optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity.

  estimation for CubeSats at LEO","12 pages",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nanosatellites, and especially CubeSats, at low earth orbits (LEOs) are a low
cost option for monitoring atmospheric and environmental conditions around
Earth. For instance, data for weather forecast reports can be obtained
periodically with these kind of small satellites. Therefore, to academic
institutions, universities, etc., this fact makes nanosatellites a very
attractive way for researching with a moderate budget.
  In this project we compute orbital lifetimes (or simply lifetimes) for
hypothetical missions involving nanosatellites at LEO, focusing our attention
on exploring regions along the equatorial line. Thus, in the framework of
orbital mechanics, we show the viability for these kind of missions in a long
and a short term. Applications are projected for countries in northern South
America, central Africa and islands/countries in southern Asia.
  To compute lifetimes, we take into account three effects: i) gravitational,
ii) Earth deformations and iii) atmospheric density. These effects are included
in the motion equation for a nanosatellite around Earth. After solving this
equation for initial altitudes in 200-800 km above mean sea level (AMSL), we
compute and report flight times to arrive at 150 km AMSL. These results are
defined here as lifetimes and they are calculated for different
atmospheric-density profiles according to experimental data and estimations.
  In conclusion, we find lowest and highest lifetimes for hypothetical missions
involving small satellites at LEO orbiting along the equatorial line, and
propose upper limits for density relative uncertainties in order to estimate
reliable lifetimes.

Hall attractor found by Gourgouliatos and Cumming in the crust exists also for

evolution timescale for the core-penetrating fields is dramatically different
than that of the fields confined to the crust. ii) The combination of Jones'
flux tube drift and Ohmic dissipation in the crust can deplete the pulsar
magnetic fields on the timescale of $150$ Myr if the crust is hot

spin-down of a young highly magnetized pulsar, can result in a partial
expulsion of flux from the core when $B\lesssim 10^{13}$ G. However for

duplicates of shared data, combining their results at the end of their

explicit static or dynamic memory allocation for duplicated state, increasing
memory footprint and contention for cache resources, especially in shared

privatization, without the increase in memory footprint or cache occupancy.
Each core in CCache dynamically privatizes commutatively manipulated data,
operating on a copy. Periodically or at the end of its computation, the core
merges its value with the value resident in memory, and when all cores have
merged, the in-memory copy contains the up-to-date value. We describe a
low-complexity architectural implementation of CCache that extends a
conventional multicore to support on-demand privatization without using
additional memory for private copies. We evaluate CCache on several high-value
applications, including random access key-value store, clustering, breadth

from the finite dimensional $l^1$-regularization optimization, the resulting
discretized $L^1$-norm does not have a decoupled form when the standard
piecewise linear finite element is employed to discretize the continuous
problem. A common approach to overcome this difficulty is employing a nodal
quadrature formula to approximately discretize the $L^1$-norm. It is inevitable
that this technique will incur an additional error. Different from the
traditional approach, a duality-based approach and an accelerated block
coordinate descent (ABCD) method is introduced to solve this type of problem
via its dual. Based on the discretized dual problem, a new discretized scheme
for the $L^1$-norm is presented. Compared new discretized scheme for $L^1$-norm
with the nodal quadrature formula, the advantages of our new discretized scheme
can be demonstrated in terms of the approximation order. More importantly,
finite element error estimates results for the primal problem with the new
discretized scheme for the $L^1$-norm are provided, which confirm that this
approximation scheme will not change the order of error estimates.

the accuracy of propagation based phase retrieval algorithms applied to
simulated intensity measurements. We employ a phase retrieval algorithm based
on the transport-of-intensity equation to obtain the phase from simulated
micrographs of procedurally generated specimens. We then train an ANN with
pairs of retrieved and exact phases, and use the trained ANN to process a test
set of retrieved phase maps. The total error in the phase is significantly
reduced using this method. We also discuss a variety of potential extensions to
this work.

Fermi/LAT 3FGL catalogue. This number could significantly increase if
multi-wavelength counterparts could be identified for the 573 3FGL blazars with

samples of other types of infrared sources located in regions of the sky where
no known blazar is present. We provide a list of potential infrared

Universe. The knowledge of their properties provides many useful astrophysical
and cosmological information.
  Our aim is to derive the luminosity and stellar mass profiles of the nearby
galaxy clusters of the Omega-WINGS survey and to study the main scaling
relations valid for such systems.
  We have merged the data of the WINGS and Omega-WINGS databases, sorted the
sources according to the distance from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and
calculated the integrated luminosity profiles in the $B$ and $V$ bands, taking
into account extinction, photometric and spatial completeness, K-correction and
background contribution. Then, by exploiting the spectroscopic sample we
derived the stellar mass profiles of the clusters.
  We got the luminosity profiles of 46 galaxy clusters, reaching $r_{200}$ in
30 cases, and the stellar mass profiles of 42 of our objects. We successfully
fitted all the integrated luminosity growth profiles with one or two embedded
S\'ersic components, deriving the main clusters parameters.
  Finally, we checked the main scaling relation among the clusters parameters
in comparison with those obtained for a selected sample of early-type galaxies
(ETGs) of the same clusters.
  We found that the nearby galaxy clusters are non-homologous structures like
ETGs and exhibit a color-magnitude (CM) red-sequence relation very similar to
that observed for galaxies in clusters. These properties are not expected in
the current cluster formation scenarios. In particular the existence of a CM
relation for clusters, shown here for the first time, suggests that the
baryonic structures grow and evolve in a similar way at all scales.

inhomogeneous structure given by a fractal relation between successive
generations. Three idealized examples are considered: networks of masses,
electric resistors, and elastic springs, which obey a specific recurrence
relation between generations. The results can be generalized to networks made
with different elements obeying equivalent relations. The equivalent values of
the networks (total mass, resistance and elastic coefficient) are compared with
their corresponding spatial scales (length, cross-section and volume) in order
to derive allometric scaling laws. Under appropriate fractal-like
approximations of the length and cross-section of the branches, some allometric
exponents reported in the literature are recovered (for instance, the 3/4-law
of metabolism in biological organisms or the hydraulic conductivity scaling in
porous networks). The formulation allows different choices of the fractal
parameters, thus enabling the derivation of new power-laws not reported before.
