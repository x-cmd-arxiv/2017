wireless networks and meet the diverse performance requirements of 5G networks.
With abundant access points, each with communication, computation and storage
resources, UDN brings unprecedented benefits, including significant improvement
in network spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, greatly reduced latency
to enable novel mobile applications, and the capability of providing massive
access for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, such great promises come
with formidable research challenges. To design and operate such complex
networks with various types of resources, efficient and innovative
methodologies will be needed. This motivates the recent introduction of highly
structured and generalizable models for network optimization. In this article,
we present some recently proposed large-scale sparse and low-rank frameworks
for optimizing UDNs, supported by various motivating applications. A special
attention is paid on algorithmic approaches to deal with nonconvex objective
functions and constraints, as well as computational scalability.

At the same time, arranged gold nanodots have important applications in

fragmentation around junctions and crossing points even at comparatively low

junction region breaks up at a lower temperature than a single nanowire. We
develop a gold parametrization for Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and
demonstrate the surface diffusion origin of the nanowire junction
fragmentation. We show that nanowire fragmentation starts at the junctions with
high reliability and propose that aligning nanowires in a regular grid could be
used as a technique for fabricating arrays of nanodots.

its impulse response, which cannot always be measured directly. This is the
case in high energy X-ray radiography, and it must be estimated from images of
calibration objects indirectly related to the impulse response. When the PSF is
assumed to have radial symmetry, it can be estimated from an image of an opaque
straight edge. We use a non-parametric Bayesian approach, where the prior
probability density for the PSF is modeled as a Gaussian Markov random field
and radial symmetry is incorporated in a novel way. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
posterior estimation is carried out by adapting a recently developed
improvement to the Gibbs sampling algorithm, referred to as partially collapsed
Gibbs sampling. Moreover, the algorithm we present is proven to satisfy
invariance with respect to the target density. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficacy of these methods on radiographic data obtained from a high-energy

we revisit RBIR by incorporating semantic specification of objects and

objects in an intuitive way, we propose recommendation techniques of spatial
relationships. In particular, by mining the search results, a system can
recommend feasible spatial relationships among the objects. The system also can
recommend likely spatial relationships by assigned object category names based
on language prior. Moreover, object-level inverted indexing supports very fast
shortlist generation, and re-ranking based on spatial constraints provides

environments remains a fundamental paradigm in nanophotonics. The use of
highly-confined plasmons in materials such as graphene provides a promising
platform to enhance transition rates in the IR-THz by many orders of magnitude.
However, such enhancements involve near-field plasmon modes or other kinds of
near-field coupling like quenching, and it is challenging to use these highly
confined modes to harness light in the far-field due to the difficulty of
plasmonic outcoupling. Here, we propose that through the use of radiative
cascade chains in multi-level emitters, IR plasmons can be used to enhance far
field spectra in the visible and UV range, even at energies greater than 10 eV.
Combining Purcell-enhancement engineering, graphene plasmonics, and radiative
cascade can result in a new type of UV emitter whose properties can be tuned by
electrically doping graphene. Varying the distance between the emitter and the
graphene surface can change the strength of the far-field emission lines by two
orders of magnitude. We also find that the dependence of the far-field emission
on the Fermi energy is potentially extremely sharp at the onset of interband
transitions, allowing the Fermi energy to effectively serve as a ""switch"" for
turning on and off certain plasmonic and far-field emissions.

between two states: Langmuir wave turbulence (LWT) and Langmuir wave
supercontinuum (LWSC), the latter of which exhibits broad power spectra with
significant spatiotemporal coherence when a certain number of plasmons (plasma
wave quanta) are excited in the system. In the LWT-LWSC transition, the
modulational instability and resulting creation of plasmon pairs are the
classical counterparts of the Cooper instability and creation of Cooper pairs
in superconducting states. The Bose-Einstein condensation of Cooper pairs in
superconducting states is replaced by the Kuramoto oscillator-entrainment of
plasmon pairs in a LWSC. The order parameter of the LWSC state, which is
defined as the mean field of the plasmon pairs, takes on a significant value,
which clearly indicates that a macroscopic number of plasmon pairs occupy a
single momentum state with an identical phase in the LWSC. The emergence of
spatiotemporal coherence and the decrease in the phase randomization are
considered as development of long-range order and spontaneous symmetry
breaking, respectively, indicating that the LWT-LWSC transition is a second
order phase transition phenomenon. By this transition, U(1) symmetry of LWT is
broken. The LWSC is, in terms of plasma physics, a so-called
Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode characterized by its undamped nature.

alarms or not. To describe the events in the human-understandable form for
event recounting, learning generic knowledge about visual concepts (e.g.,
object and action) is crucial. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have achieved promising results in learning such concepts, it remains an open
question as to how to effectively use CNNs for abnormal event detection, mainly
due to the environment-dependent nature of the anomaly detection. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by integrating a generic CNN model and
environment-dependent anomaly detectors. Our approach first learns CNN with
multiple visual tasks to exploit semantic information that is useful for
detecting and recounting abnormal events. By appropriately plugging the model
into anomaly detectors, we can detect and recount abnormal events while taking
advantage of the discriminative power of CNNs. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art on Avenue and UCSD Ped2 benchmarks for abnormal event
detection and also produces promising results of abnormal event recounting.

communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length)
can be attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each
party may depend on all previous outputs of its counterpart, in a (first order)
Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to the last observed output only.
In the special case where there is no dependence on previous outputs (no
interaction), the maximal achievable rate is given by the (one-way) Shannon
capacity $1-h(\varepsilon)$. For Markovian protocols, we first show that a rate
of $\frac{2}{3}(1-h(\varepsilon))$ can be trivially achieved. We then describe
a more involved coding scheme and provide a closed-form lower bound for its
rate at any noise level $\varepsilon$. Specifically, we show that this scheme
outperforms the trivial one for any $\varepsilon<0.044$, and achieves a rate
higher than
$\frac{1-h(\varepsilon)}{1+h(\varepsilon)+h\left(<\varepsilon(2-\varepsilon)>\right)}=1-\Theta(h(\varepsilon))$

can affect the post-measured states left to Bob by choosing different
measurements on her half. Alice can convince Bob that she has such an ability
if and only if the unnormalized postmeasured states cannot be described by a
local-hidden-state (LHS) model. In this case, the state is termed steerable
from Alice to Bob. By converting the problem to construct LHS models for
two-qubit Bell diagonal states to the one for Werner states, we obtain the
optimal models given by Jevtic \textit{et al.} [J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 32, A40

metatranscriptomic technologies allow cataloging of functional characteristics

studies have found that a community's composition in terms of ecologically
relevant functional traits or guilds can be conserved more strictly across
varying settings than taxonomic composition is. I use a standard ecological
resource-consumer model to examine the dynamics of traits relevant to resource
consumption, and analyze determinants of functional composition. This model
demonstrates that interaction with essential resources can regulate the
community-wide abundance of ecologically relevant traits, keeping them at
consistent levels despite large changes in the abundances of the species
housing those traits in response to changes in the environment, and across
variation between communities in species composition. Functional composition is
shown to be able to track differences in environmental conditions faithfully
across differences in community composition. Mathematical conditions on
consumers' vital rates and functional responses sufficient to produce
conservation of functional community structure across taxonomic differences are
presented.

actions of a human participant must be observed and analyzed for errors in

most coaching systems only provide coarse information on movement quality, such
as a scalar value per body part that describes the overall deviation from the
correct movement. Further, they are often limited to static body postures or
rather simple movements of single body parts. While there are many approaches
to distinguish between different types of movements (e.g., between walking and
jumping), the detection of more subtle errors in a motor performance is less

aligned via Dynamic Time Warping. Next, we extract a feature vector from the

out by tracking the evolution of the unstable manifold of the rest state using
the timescale separation. This entails a careful consideration of how the

monotonicity in the spatial parameter, which distinguishes this application of
the Maslov index from similar analyses of Hamiltonian systems.

particularly important for tuning the energy of the Fermi level, a key step in
observing spin-polarized surface currents and the quantum anomalous Hall
effect. Previous studies reported the chemical tuning of the Fermi level to the
Dirac point by controlling the Sb:Bi composition ratio, but the optimum ratio
varies widely across various studies with no consensus. In this work, we use
scanning tunneling microscopy and Landau level spectroscopy, in combination
with X-ray photoemission spectroscopy to isolate the effects of growth factors
such as temperature and composition, and to provide a microscopic picture of
the role that disorder and composition play in determining the carrier density
of epitaxially grown (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. Using Landau level
spectroscopy, we determine that the ideal Sb concentration to place the Fermi
energy to within a few meV of the Dirac point is $x\sim 0.7$. However, we find
that the post- growth annealing temperature can have a drastic impact on
microscopic structure as well as carrier density. In particular, we find that
when films are post-growth annealed at high temperature, better crystallinity
and surface roughness are achieved; but this also produces a larger Te defect
density, adding n-type carriers. This work provides key information necessary

The problem, asking if all finitely presented groups have semistable

ascending HNN extension of a finitely presented group then indeed, $G$ has
semistable fundamental group at $\infty$, but since the early 1980's it has
been suggested that the finitely presented groups that are ascending HNN
extensions of {\it finitely generated} groups may include a group with
non-semistable fundamental group at $\infty$. Ascending HNN extensions
naturally break into two classes, those with bounded depth and those with
unbounded depth. Our main theorem shows that bounded depth finitely presented
ascending HNN extensions of finitely generated groups have semistable
fundamental group at $\infty$. Semistability is equivalent to two weaker
asymptotic conditions on the group holding simultaneously. We show one of these
conditions holds for all ascending HNN extensions, regardless of depth. We give

hydrodynamics (SPH). The outflow boundary conditions are implemented using an
outflow zone downstream of the outlet, where particles are moved using an
outgoing wave equation for the velocity field so that feedback noise from the
outlet boundary is greatly reduced. For unidirectional flow across the outlet,
this condition reduces to Orlanski's wave equation. The performance of the
method is demonstrated through several two-dimensional test problems, including
unsteady, plane Poiseuille flow, flow between two inclined plates, the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a channel, and flow in a constricted conduit,
and in three-dimensions for turbulent flow in a $90^{\circ}$ section of a
curved square pipe. The results show that spurious waves incident from the
outlet are effectively absorbed and that steady-state laminar flows can be
maintained for much longer times compared to periodic boundary conditions. In
addition, time-dependent anisotropies in the flow, like fluid recirculations,
are convected across the outlet in a very stable and accurate manner.

  rays","11 pages and 6 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Up to date, there is no consensus regarding the origin of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECR) beyond the Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuzmin (GZK) limit. In order
for these UHECRs to reach the Earth, an extremely suppressed interaction
between them and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is required, which is
impossible for standard model (SM) particles, except neutrinos. In this letter,
we present constraints on the parameter space of models involving axion-like
particles and dark photons, as candidates for UHECRs, by assuming that these
particles can traverse the visible Universe without decaying. In the case of
axion-like particles, the constraints are tighter than those given in previous
works. We present for the first time constraints on the parameter space of dark
photon models, by considering their kinetic term mixing with SM photons.

\emph{Swift} and \emph{Fermi} to re-derive the parameters of the Yonetoku
correlation. This allowed me to self-consistently estimate pseudo redshifts of
all the bursts with unknown redshifts. This is the first time such a large
sample of GRBs from these two instruments are used, both individually and in
conjunction, to model the long GRB luminosity function. The GRB formation rate
is modelled as the product of the cosmic star formation rate and a GRB
formation efficiency for a given stellar mass. An exponential cut-off powerlaw
luminosity function fits the data reasonably well, with $\nu = 0.6$ and $ L_b =
5.4 \times10^{52} \, \rm{erg.s^{-1}},$ and does not require a cosmological
evolution. In the case of a broken powerlaw, it is required to incorporate a
sharp evolution of the break given by
$L_{b}\sim0.3\times10^{52}\left(1+z\right)^{2.90} \, \rm{erg.s^{-1}},$ and the
GRB formation efficiency (degenerate up to a beaming factor of GRBs) decreases
with redshift as $\propto\left(1+z\right)^{-0.80}.$ However it is not possible
to distinguish between the two models. The derived models are then used as
templates to predict the distribution of GRBs detectable by CZTI on board
\emph{AstroSat}, as a function of redshift and luminosity. This demonstrates
that via a quick localization and redshift measurement of even a few CZTI GRBs,
\emph{AstroSat} will help in improving the statistics of GRBs both typical and
peculiar.

wide variety of scenarios beyond the simplest WIMP models. Kinetic mixing of

and operators to split states and suppress indirect detection signals. Models
with a ""portalino"", a neutral fermion that marries a linear combination of a
standard model neutrino and dark sector fermion and carries a conserved quantum

effective interaction between the dark sector and the standard model. These
interactions can be simple $Z'$ type interactions or lepton-flavor changing.
Dark matter freezes out into neutrinos, thereby evading CMB constraints, and
conventional direct detection signals are largely absent. The model offers
different signals, however. The ""portalino"" mechanism itself predicts small

of discovering the portalino particle in collider experiments. Possible

order insensitive to charge fluctuations while maintaining nonzero

the X-ray gas is broader than that obtained at these other wavelengths. By
mapping the density and temperature distribution of the hot gas in the NLR, we
demonstrate the presence of shocks towards the west ($M=2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$) and
east ($M=1.5^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$). Moreover, we compute the flux ratios between the

framework, with particular focus on the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities such as the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Work by Pessah
and Psaltis showed that MRI is stabilized beyond a critical toroidal field in
compressible, differentially rotating flows and, also, reported the appearance
of two new instabilities beyond this field. Their results stemmed from
considering geometric curvature effects due to the suprathermal background
toroidal field, which had been previously ignored in weak-field studies.
However, their calculations were performed under the local approximation, which
poses the danger of introducing spurious behavior due to the introduction of
global geometric terms in an otherwise local framework. In order to avoid this,
we perform a global eigenvalue analysis of the linearized MHD equations in
cylindrical geometry. We confirm that MRI indeed tends to be highly suppressed
when the background toroidal field attains the Pessah-Psaltis limit. We also
observe the appearance of two new instabilities that emerge in the presence of
highly suprathermal toroidal fields. These results were additionally verified
using numerical simulations in PLUTO. There are, however, certain differences
between the the local and global results, especially in the vertical wavenumber
occupancies of the various instabilities, which we discuss in detail. We also
study the global eigenfunctions of the most unstable modes in the suprathermal
regime, which are inaccessible in the local analysis. Overall, our findings
emphasize the necessity of a global treatment for accurately modeling strongly
magnetized accretion discs.

a Lagrangian describing the $t$-channel exchange of Glauber quarks in the Regge

non-local fermionic potential operators. These operators are power suppressed
in $|t|/s$ relative to those describing Glauber gluon exchange, but give the
first non-vanishing contributions in the Regge limit to processes such as
$q\bar q \to gg$ and $q\bar q \to \gamma \gamma$. They therefore represent an
interesting subset of power corrections to study. The structure of the
operators, which describe certain soft and collinear emissions to all orders
through Wilson lines, is derived from the symmetries of the effective theory
combined with constraints from power and mass dimension counting, as well as
through explicit matching calculations. Lightcone singularities in the
fermionic potentials are regulated using a rapidity regulator, whose
corresponding renormalization group evolution gives rise to the Reggeization of
the quark at the amplitude level and the BFKL equation at the cross section
level. We verify this at one-loop, deriving the Regge trajectory of the quark
in the $3$ color channel, as well as the leading logarithmic BFKL equation.
Results in the $\bar 6$ and $15$ color channels are obtained by the
simultaneous exchange of a Glauber quark and a Glauber gluon. SCET with quark

study the structure of QCD amplitudes in the Regge limit, and derive

sample of 194 kinematically classified galaxies, which is agnostic to visual
morphology. We use u-r and NUV-u colours from SDSS and GALEX and an existing
inference package, STARPY, to conduct a first look at the onset time and
exponentially declining rate of quenching of these galaxies. An
Anderson-Darling test on the distribution of the inferred quenching rates
across the two kinematic populations reveals they are statistically
distinguishable ($3.2\sigma$). We find that fast rotators quench at a much
wider range of rates than slow rotators, consistent with a wide variety of
physical processes such as secular evolution, minor mergers, gas accretion and
environmentally driven mechanisms. Quenching is more likely to occur at rapid
rates ($\tau \lesssim 1~\rm{Gyr}$) for slow rotators, in agreement with
theories suggesting slow rotators are formed in dynamically fast processes,
such as major mergers. Interestingly, we also find that a subset of the fast
rotators quench at these same rapid rates as the bulk of the slow rotator
sample. We therefore discuss how the total gas mass of a merger, rather than
the merger mass ratio, may decide a galaxy's ultimate kinematic fate.

are responsible for the observed velocity offsets and are due to shocks, either
from AGN outflows (in four galaxies) or gas inflowing along a bar (in three

offset originates from a spatially offset AGN in a galaxy merger. The optical
line flux ratios of the offset AGN are consistent with pure photoionization,

is crucial to fully understand the planet formation process and its outcome.
Despite being located far enough from the central star to be spatially resolved
with ALMA, the CO snowline remains difficult to detect directly in
protoplanetary disks. Instead, its location can be derived from N$_2$H$^+$
emission, when chemical effects like photodissociation of CO and N$_2$ are
taken into account. The water snowline is even harder to observe than that for
CO, because in disks it is located only a few AU from the protostar, and from
the ground only the less abundant isotopologue H$_2^{18}$O can be observed.
Therefore, using an indirect chemical tracer, as done for CO, may be the best
way to locate the water snowline. A good candidate tracer is HCO$^+$, which is
expected to be particularly abundant when its main destructor, H$_2$O, is
frozen out. Comparison of H$_2^{18}$O and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission toward the
envelope of the Class 0 protostar IRAS2A shows that the emission from both
molecules is spatially anticorrelated, providing a proof of concept that
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ can indeed be used to trace the water snowline in systems where
it cannot be imaged directly.

Having to adhere to requirements of platforms like Twitter, researchers cannot

This leads to the problem that subsets of the data may no longer be available,
as content can be deleted or user accounts deactivated. To quantify the impact
of content deletion in the replicability of datasets in a long term, we perform
a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of 30 Twitter datasets, which

2012 and 2016, and recollecting them later by using the tweet IDs, we look at
four different factors that quantify the extent to which recollected datasets
resemble original ones: completeness, representativity, similarity and
changingness. Even though the ratio of available tweets keeps decreasing as the
dataset gets older, we find that the textual content of the recollected subset

multiwavelength flares, however, the physical processes responsible for these
flares are not well understood. In this paper we develop a time-dependent
inhomogeneous fluid jet emission model for blazars. We model optically thick
radio flares for the first time and show that they are delayed with respect to
the prompt optically thin emission by ~ months to decades, with a lag that
increases with the jet power and observed wavelength. This lag is caused by a
combination of the travel time of the flaring plasma to the optically thin
radio emitting sections of the jet and the slow rise time of the radio flare.
We predict two types of flares: symmetric flares - with the same rise and decay
time, which occur for flares whose duration is shorter than both the radiative
lifetime and the geometric path-length delay timescale; extended flares - whose
luminosity tracks the power of particle acceleration in the flare, which occur
for flares with a duration longer than both the radiative lifetime and
geometric delay. Our model naturally produces orphan X-ray and $\gamma$-ray
flares. These are caused by flares which are only observable above the
quiescent jet emission in a narrow band of frequencies. Our model is able to
successfully fit to the observed multiwavelength flaring spectra and
lightcurves of PKS1502+106 across all wavelengths, using a transient flaring
front located within the broad-line region.

promotes the conversion of materials in its environment into a nearly identical
copy of itself. The challenge of engineering novel, micro- or nano-scale
self-replicators has attracted keen interest in recent years, both because
exponential amplification is an attractive method for generating high yields of
specific products, and also because self-reproducing entities have the
potential to be optimized or adapted through rounds of iterative selection.
Substantial steps forward have been achieved both in the engineering of
particular self-replicating molecules, and also in characterizing the physical
basis for possible mechanisms of self-replication. At present, however, there
is need for a theoretical treatment of what physical conditions are most
conducive to the emergence of novel self-replicating structures from a
reservoir of building blocks on a desired time-scale. Here we report progress
in addressing this need. By analyzing the dynamics of a generic class of
heterogeneous particle mixtures whose reaction rates emerge from basic physical
interactions, we demonstrate that the spontaneous discovery of self-replication
is controlled by relatively generic features of the chemical space, namely: the
dispersion in the distribution of reaction timescales and bound-state energies.
Based on this analysis, we provide quantitative criteria that may aid
experimentalists in designing a system capable of producing self-replicators,
and in estimating the likely timescale for exponential growth to start.

develop a deterministic particle method for linear and nonlinear diffusion. At
first glance, deterministic particle methods are incompatible with diffusive

by classical vortex blob methods, we introduce a nonlocal regularization of our
velocity field that ensures particles do remain particles, and we apply this to
develop a numerical blob method for a range of diffusive partial differential
equations of Wasserstein gradient flow type, including the heat equation, the
porous medium equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, the Keller-Segel equation,
and its variants. Our choice of regularization is guided by the Wasserstein
gradient flow structure, and the corresponding energy has a novel form,
combining aspects of the well-known interaction and potential energies. In the
presence of a confining drift or interaction potential, we prove that
minimizers of the regularized energy exist and, as the regularization is
removed, converge to the minimizers of the unregularized energy. We then
restrict our attention to nonlinear diffusion of porous medium type with at
least quadratic exponent. Under sufficient regularity assumptions, we prove
that gradient flows of the regularized energies converge to solutions of the
porous medium equation. As a corollary, we obtain convergence of our numerical
blob method, again under sufficient regularity assumptions. We conclude by
considering a range of numerical examples to demonstrate our method's rate of
convergence to exact solutions and to illustrate key qualitative properties
preserved by the method, including asymptotic behavior of the Fokker-Planck

multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films has triggered a renewed interest on
photoferroelectric materials for photovoltaic applications. Tremendous advance
has been done to improve power conversion efficiency (up to up to 8.1%) in
photoferroelectrics via absorption increase using narrow bandgap
ferroelectrics. Other strategies, as it is the more efficient use of
ferroelectric internal electric field, are ongoing. Moreover, as a by-product,
several progress have been also achieved on photostriction that is the
photo-induced deformation phenomenon. Here, we review ongoing and promising
routes to improve ferroelectrics photoresponse.

gravitational waves. While general relativity allows for tensorial (plus and
cross) modes only, a generic metric theory may, in principle, predict waves
with up to six different polarizations. This analysis is sensitive to
continuous signals of scalar, vector or tensor polarizations, and does not rely
on any specific theory of gravity. After searching data from the first
observation run of the advanced LIGO detectors for signals at twice the
rotational frequency of 200 known pulsars, we find no evidence of gravitational
waves of any polarization. We report the first upper limits for scalar and
vector strains, finding values comparable in magnitude to previously-published
limits for tensor strain. Our results may be translated into constraints on
specific alternative theories of gravity.

superconformal algebra $F(4)$, we search for the holographic duals to
co-dimension one superconformal defects in 5d CFTs which have $SO(4,2) \oplus
U(1)$ bosonic symmetry. In particular, we look for domain wall solutions to
six-dimensional $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to a single vector
multiplet. It is found that supersymmetric domain wall solutions do not exist
unless there is a non-trivial profile for one of the vector multiplet scalars
which is charged under the gauged $SU(2)$ R-symmetry. This non-trivial profile
breaks the $SU(2)$ to $U(1)$, thus matching expectations from the superalgebra
analysis. A consistent set of BPS equations is then obtained and solved
numerically. While the numerical solutions are generically singular and thought
to be dual to boundary CFTs, it is found that for certain fine-tuned choices of
parameters regular Janus solutions may be obtained.

to adjacent heavy metals can induce Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions.
Knowledge of the DM parameters is essential for understanding and designing
exotic spin structures, such as hedgehog Skyrmions and chiral N\'eel walls,
which are attractive for use in novel information storage technologies. We
introduce a framework for computing the DM interaction in two-dimensional
Rashba antiferromagnets. Unlike in Rashba ferromagnets, the DM interaction is
not suppressed even at low temperatures. The material parameters control both
the strength and the sign of the interfacial DM interaction. Our results
suggest a route toward controlling the DM interaction in AFM materials by means
of doping and electric fields.

through both observational and theoretical research. The internal structure of
pulsating hydrogen shell white dwarfs (ZZ Ceti stars) detected by
asteroseismology is regarded as the representative of all DA white dwarfs.
Observations for KUV~08368+4026, which locates in the middle of the ZZ Ceti
instability strip, have been carried out in 1999 and from 2009 to 2012 with
either single-site runs or multisite campaigns. Time-series photometric data of
about 300 hours were collected in total. Through data reduction and analysis,
30 frequencies were extracted, including four triplets, two doublets, one
single mode and further signals. The independent modes are identified as either
l=1 or l=2 modes. Hence, a rotation period of $5.52\pm 0.22$ days was deduced
from the period spacing in the multiplets. Theoretical static models were built
and a best fit model for KUV~08368+4026 was obtained with $0.692\pm0.002$ solar
mass, $(2.92\pm0.02)\times 10^{-3}$ solar luminosity and the hydrogen mass
fraction of $10^{-4}$ stellar mass.

quarks, gluons and leptons. Baryons and Mesons composed of quarks were arranged
by Gell-Mann and Okubo in their well-known Eight-Fold way up to SU(3) symmetry.
Standard model of particles is composed of these particles. Particles in SU(4)
also make some beautiful patron. These make some multiplets. but all the
baryons with spin JP= 3/2+ in these multiplets have not been observed till

easy and new way. As a result we obtained some clues about the masses and other
characteristics of the unknown hyperons. These approximations about the
characteristics of the unidentified baryons have been recorded in this article.

it is possible to define a statistical mechanics of trajectories which reveals
the dynamical phase structure of systems with complex relaxation such as
glasses. Lecture 3 is about closed (i.e. isolated) many-body quantum systems. I

clustering and graph embeddings. An embedding $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ of a
graph $G$ into a 2-manifold $M$ maps the vertices in $V(G)$ to distinct points
and the edges in $E(G)$ to interior-disjoint Jordan arcs between the
corresponding vertices. In applications in clustering, cartography, and
visualization, nearby vertices and edges are often bundled to the same point or
overlapping arcs, due to data compression or low resolution. This raises the
computational problem of deciding whether a given map $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$
comes from an embedding. A map $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ is a \textbf{weak
embedding} if it can be perturbed into an embedding
$\psi_\varepsilon:G\rightarrow M$ with
$\|\varphi-\psi_\varepsilon\|<\varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon>0$, where
$\|.\|$ is the unform norm. A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing weak
embeddings has recently been found by Fulek and Kyn\v{c}l. It reduces the
problem to solving a system of linear equations over $\mathbb{Z}_2$. It runs in
$O(n^{2\omega})\leq O(n^{4.75})$ time, where $\omega\in [2,2.373)$ is the
matrix multiplication exponent and $n$ is the number of vertices and edges of
$G$. We improve the running time to $O(n\log n)$. Our algorithm is also
conceptually simpler: We perform a sequence of \emph{local operations} that
gradually ""untangles"" the image $\varphi(G)$ into an embedding $\psi(G)$, or
reports that $\varphi$ is not a weak embedding. It combines local constraints
on the orientation of subgraphs directly, thereby eliminating the need for
solving large systems of linear equations.

The small amount of available datasets for supervised ATE and the fact that

in new and creative ways. Publicly available review corpora contain a plethora
of opinionated aspect terms and cover a larger domain spectrum. In this paper,
we first propose a method for using such review corpora for creating a new

sentences that have a high likelihood of containing actual opinionated aspects.
We thus improve the quality of the extracted aspects. We then use the
constructed dataset to train a model and perform ATE with distant supervision.
By evaluating on human annotated datasets, we prove that our method achieves a
significantly improved performance over various unsupervised and supervised

creating new datasets for ATE. Specifically, we show that, using a set of

Raman scattering (SERS), by localizing the incident field into hot spots. The
localized hot spot field can be enhanced even further when linear Fano
resonances (FR) take place in a double resonance scheme. However, hot spot
enhancement is limited with the modification of the vibrational modes, the
break-down of the molecule and the tunnelling regime. Here, we present a method
which can circumvent these limitations. Our analytical model and solutions of
3D Maxwell equations show that: enhancement due to the localized field can be
multiplied by a factor of $10^2$ to $10^3$. Moreover, this can be performed
without increasing the hot spot intensity which also avoids the modification of
the Raman modes. Unlike linear Fano resonances, we create a path interference
in the nonlinear response. We demonstrate on a single equation that enhancement
takes place due to cancellation of the contributing terms in the denominator of
the SERS response.

the magnetic field. We find that a jet with density greater than $5\times
10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and hotspot magnetic field in the range 50-400 $\mu$G are
required to explain the synchrotron emission at 43 GHz. The upper-energy
cut-off in the hotspot synchrotron spectrum is at a frequency < $5\times
10^{14}$ Hz, indicating that the maximum energy of non-thermal electrons
accelerated at the jet reverse shock is $E_{e, \rm max} \sim 0.8$ TeV in a
magnetic field of 100 $\mu$G. Based on the condition that the
magnetic-turbulence scale length has to be larger than the plasma skin depth,
and that the energy density in non-thermal particles cannot violate the limit
imposed by the jet kinetic luminosity, we show that $E_{e,\rm max}$ cannot be
constrained by synchrotron losses as traditionally assumed. In addition to
that, and assuming that the shock is quasi-perpendicular, we show that
non-resonant hybrid instabilities generated by the streaming of cosmic rays

from discrete sources. We find that the DIG has two dominant velocity
components, one centered around 100km/s associated with the luminous HII region
W43, and the other centered around 45km/s not associated with any large HII
region. Our analysis suggests that the two velocity components near W43 may be
caused by non-circular streaming motions originating near the end of the
Galactic bar. At lower Galactic longitudes, the two velocities may instead
arise from gas at two distinct distances from the Sun, with the most likely
distances being ~6kpc for the 100km/s component and ~12kpc for the 45km/s

caused by excitation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is correlated with
both the locations of discrete HII regions and the intensity of the RRL

responsible for creating the infrared emission have a similar origin as the
harder ultra-violet photons required for the RRL emission. The 8.0um emission
increases with RRL intensity but flattens out for directions with the most
intense RRL emission, suggesting that PAHs are partially destroyed by the

the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer
patients, where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing
the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription
dose. The average value of the absolute differences in [max, mean] dose is
found to be under 5% of the prescription dose, specifically for each structure

continuous density field formed through the superimposition of smoothing

achieved by aligning, for each fingerprint instance, the neighboring atoms onto

constructing the density fields, and characterize their performance for fitting

incident at the top of the atmosphere as a function of orbital phase. The two
main properties of a planet that influence the time-dependent nature of the

criterion for which the flux variation due to obliquity is equivalent to the
flux variation due to orbital eccentricity. This equivalence is computed for
both the maximum and average flux scenarios, the latter of which includes the
effects of the diurnal cycle. We apply these calculations to four known

atmospheres of planets around other stars at extremely high contrast levels. To
achieve this goal, coronagraphic instruments have favored integral field
spectrographs (IFS) as the science cameras to disperse the entire search area
at once and obtain spectra at each location, since the planet position is not
known a priori. These spectrographs are useful against confusion from speckles
and background objects, and can also help in the speckle subtraction and
wavefront control stages of the coronagraphic observation. We present a
software package, the Coronagraph and Rapid Imaging Spectrograph in Python
(crispy) to simulate the IFS of the WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). The
software propagates input science cubes using spatially and spectrally resolved
coronagraphic focal plane cubes, transforms them into IFS detector maps and
ultimately reconstructs the spatio-spectral input scene as a 3D datacube.
Simulated IFS cubes can be used to test data extraction techniques, refine
sensitivity analyses and carry out design trade studies of the flight CGI-IFS
instrument. crispy is a publicly available Python package and can be adapted to
other IFS designs.

usefulness in this open context depends on the quality and diversity of
descriptive metadata for collection objects. In many cases, existing metadata
is not adequate for a variety of retrieval and research tasks and more specific
annotations are necessary. However, eliciting such annotations is a challenge
since it often requires domain-specific knowledge. Where crowdsourcing can be
successfully used for eliciting simple annotations, identifying people with the
required expertise might prove troublesome for tasks requiring more complex or
domain-specific knowledge. Nichesourcing addresses this problem, by tapping
into the expert knowledge available in niche communities. This paper presents
Accurator, a methodology for conducting nichesourcing campaigns for cultural
heritage institutions, by addressing communities, organizing events and
tailoring a web-based annotation tool to a domain of choice. The contribution
of this paper is threefold: 1) a nichesourcing methodology, 2) an annotation
tool for experts and 3) validation of the methodology and tool in three case
studies. The three domains of the case studies are birds on art, bible prints
and fashion images. We compare the quality and quantity of obtained annotations
in the three case studies, showing that the nichesourcing methodology in
combination with the image annotation tool can be used to collect high quality
annotations in a variety of domains and annotation tasks. A user evaluation
indicates the tool is suited and usable for domain specific annotation tasks.

to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in

optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most
trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities
to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our
previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to
efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our
approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which
seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced
by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we
propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft
constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically
consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime
capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several
multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the
proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are
consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate how timing
optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with

allows motion planners to comprise dynamics between rigid bodies, which is
necessary for planning this type of actions. However, physics-based motion
planning is computationally intensive due to the high dimensionality of the
state space and the need to work with a low integration step to find accurate
solutions. On the other hand, manipulation actions change the environment and
conditions further actions and motions. To cope with this issue, the
representation of manipulation actions using ontologies enables a
semantic-based inference process that alleviates the computational cost of
motion planning. This paper proposes a manipulation planning framework where
physics-based motion planning is enhanced with ontological knowledge
representation and reasoning. The proposal has been implemented and is
illustrated and validated with a simple example. Its use in grasping tasks in
cluttered environments is currently under development.

representation of time-series data. In this work, symbolic dynamics-based tools
have been used to infer an approximate generative Markov model. The time-series
data are first symbolized by partitioning the continuous measurement space of
the signal and then, the discrete sequential data are modeled using symbolic
dynamics. In the proposed approach, the size of temporal memory of the symbol
sequence is estimated from spectral properties of the resulting stochastic
matrix corresponding to a first-order Markov model of the symbol sequence.
Then, hierarchical clustering is used to represent the states of the
corresponding full-state Markov model to construct a reduced-order or size
Markov model with a non-deterministic algebraic structure. Subsequently, the
parameters of the reduced-order Markov model are identified from the original
model by making use of a Bayesian inference rule. The final model is selected
using information-theoretic criteria. The proposed concept is elucidated and
validated on two different data sets as examples. The first example analyzes a
set of pressure data from a swirl-stabilized combustor, where controlled
protocols are used to induce flame instabilities. Variations in the complexity
of the derived Markov model represent how the system operating condition
changes from a stable to an unstable combustion regime. In the second example,
the data set is taken from NASA's data repository for prognostics of bearings
on rotating shafts. We show that, even with a very small state-space, the
reduced-order models are able to achieve comparable performance and that the
proposed approach provides flexibility in the selection of a final model for
representation and learning.

a first-principles canonical quantization scheme for the study of the
matter-field interaction, we give closed-form expressions for the
non-equilibrium Casimir force and the heat transfer between plates of thickness
$d_{\rm L},d_{\rm R}$. We distinguish three different contributions to the
Casimir force and to the heat transfer in the general non-equilibrium
situation: two associated to each of the plates, and one to the initial state
of the field. We analyze the dependence of the Casimir force and heat transfer
with the plate thickness (setting $d_{\rm L}=d_{\rm R}\equiv d$), showing the
scale at which each magnitude converges to the value of infinite thickness
($d\rightarrow+\infty$) and how to correctly reproduce the non-equilibrium
Lifshitz's formula. For the heat transfer, we show that Landauer's formula does
not apply to every case (where the three contributions are present), but it is
correct for some specific situations. We also analyze the interplay of the
different contributions for realistic experimental and nanotechnological
conditions, showing the impact of the thickness in the measurements. For small
thickness (compared to the separation distance), the plates act to decrease the
background blackbody flux, while for large thickness the heat is given by the
baths' contribution only. The combination of these behaviors allows for the
possibility of having a tunable minimum in the heat transfer that is
experimentally attainable and observable for metals, and also of having
vanishing heat flux in the gap when those difference are of opposite signs
(thermal shielding). These features turns out to be relevant for
nanotechnological applications.

through the result of its convolution with an unknown filter $h \in
\mathbb{R}^L$. This problem, also known as blind deconvolution, has been
studied extensively by the signal processing and applied mathematics
communities, leading to a diversity of proofs and algorithms based on various
assumptions on the filter and its input. Sparsity of this filter, or in
contrast, non vanishing of its Fourier transform are instances of such
assumptions. The main result of this paper shows that blind deconvolution can
be solved through nuclear norm relaxation in the case of a fully unknown
channel, as soon as this channel is probed through a few $N \gtrsim \mu^2_m
K^{1/2}$ input signals $x_n = C_n m_n$, $n=1,\ldots,N,$ that are living in
known $K$-dimensional subspaces $C_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^L$. This result holds with
high probability on the genericity of the subspaces $C_n$ as soon as $L\gtrsim
K^{3/2}$ and $N\gtrsim K^{1/2}$ up to log factors. Our proof system relies on
the construction of a certificate of optimality for the underlying convex
program. This certificate expands as a Neumann series and is shown to satisfy
the conditions for the recovery of the matrix encoding the unknowns by
controlling the terms in this series. An incidental consequence of the result
of this paper, following from the lack of assumptions on the filter, is that
nuclear norm relaxation can be extended from blind deconvolution to blind
super-resolution, as soon as the unknown ideal low pass filter has a
sufficiently large support compared to the ambient dimension $L$. Numerical
experiments supporting the theory as well as its application to blind

a concept of Brauer permutations as an intermediate one between Brauer graphs

considerable attention when both the data has been fully observed and in the
case of partially observed (censored) samples. In survival analysis or clinical
trials, a typical problem encountered in the data collection stage is that the
samples may be censored from the right. The variable of interest could be
observed partially due to the presence of a set of events that occur at random
and potentially censor the data. Consequently, developing a methodology that
enables robust estimation of the lifetimes in such setting is of high interest
for researchers.
  In this paper, we propose a non-parametric linear density estimator using
empirical wavelet coefficients that are fully data driven. We derive an
asymptotically unbiased estimator constructed from the complete sample based on
an inductive bias correction procedure. Also, we provide upper bounds for the
bias and analyze the large sample behavior of the expected $\mathbb{L}_{2}$
estimation error based on the approach used by Stute (1995), showing that the
estimates are asymptotically normal and possess global mean square consistency.
  In addition, we evaluate the proposed approach via a theoretical simulation
study using different exemplary baseline distributions with different sample
sizes. In this study, we choose a censoring scheme that produces a censoring
proportion of 40\% on average. Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to real
data-sets previously published, showing that the proposed wavelet estimator
provides a robust and useful tool for the non-parametric estimation of the
survival time density function.

formation histories vary dramatically from model to model in the near-infrared.
We find that this variation is largely driven by the choice of stellar spectral
library, such that models including high quality spectral libraries provide the
best fits to the data, and are the most self-consistent when comparing
optically-derived properties with near-infrared ones. We also find the impact
of age variation in the near-infrared to be subtle, and largely encoded in the
shape of the continuum, meaning that the common approach of removing continuum

image retrieval. By formulating this procedure as a multilinear based
optimization problem, the complementary information hidden in different indexes
can be explored more thoroughly. Specially, we first build our multiple indexes
from various visual representations. Then a so-called index-specific functional
matrix, which aims to propagate similarities, is introduced for updating the
original index. The functional matrices are then optimized in a unified tensor
space to achieve a refinement, such that the relevant images can be pushed more
closer. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the augmented
Lagrangian method with theoretical convergence guarantee. Unlike the
traditional multi-index fusion scheme, our approach embeds the multi-index

little additional memory consumption in online query stage. Experimental

that produce converging hierarchies of lower bounds for polynomial minimization
problems have gained much popularity. At their heart, these hierarchies rely
crucially on Positivstellens\""atze from the late 20th century (e.g., due to
Stengle, Putinar, or Schm\""udgen) that certify positivity of a polynomial on an
arbitrary closed basic semialgebraic set. In this paper, we show that such
hierarchies could in fact be designed from much more limited
Positivstellens\""atze dating back to the early 20th century that only certify
positivity of a polynomial globally. More precisely, we show that any inner
approximation to the cone of positive homogeneous polynomials that is
arbitrarily tight can be turned into a converging hierarchy of lower bounds for
general polynomial minimization problems with compact feasible sets. This in
particular leads to a semidefinite programming-based hierarchy that relies
solely on Artin's solution to Hilbert's 17th problem. We also use a classical
result of Poly\'a on global positivity of even forms to construct an
""optimization-free"" converging hierarchy for general polynomial minimization
problems. This hierarchy only requires polynomial multiplication and checking
nonnegativity of coefficients of certain fixed polynomials. As a corollary, we
obtain new linear programming and second-order cone programming-based
hierarchies for polynomial minimization problems that rely on the recently
introduced concepts of dsos and sdsos polynomials. We remark that the scope of
this paper is theoretical at this stage as our hierarchies-though they involve
at most two sum of squares constraints or only basic arithmetic at each
level-require the use of bisection and increase the number of variables (resp.
degree) of the problem by the number of inequality constraints plus three

being two times $\tau_{\rm{d}}$, is representative of the minimum
characteristic timescale, we can derive upper bounds to the mass of the black
hole}. In the case of the Kerr black hole, the timescale of $\Delta
t_{\rm{min}}^{\rm{ob}}=$ 0.89 hours gives $M_{\bullet}\la 10^{9.20} M_{\odot}$,
which is consistent with measurements reported in the literature. This

t_{\rm{min}}^{\rm{ob}}$ is consistent with the measurements/data.

The scalar meson exchange potential simulates the higher order multi-pion

BAM1 cluster ($\mathcal{P} \sim 0.74$), BA or BPCA cluster ($\mathcal{P} \sim

size parameter ($X$) on the light scattering properties of aggregates (BA and
BAM2) having different porosities is explored in this study. We find that the
positive polarization maximum ($P_{max}$), the amplitude of the negative
polarization ($P_{min}$) and phase function at the exact backscattering
direction ($S_{11}$(180$^\circ$)) are correlated with the porosity of
aggregates. Compact aggregates show deeper negative polarization as compared to
porous aggregates when the characteristic radius ($R$) of the aggregates are
considered to be the same. Further lower porosity aggregates show higher
$S_{11}$(180$^\circ$) and vice versa. When $\mathcal{P}$ is increased in a

linearly, whereas P$_{max}$ increases linearly. We also find that the porosity
of the aggregates plays a crucial role in determining the polarimetric color
for high absorbing organic refractories. The compact clusters (BAM1 and BAM2)
show the negative polarimetric color whereas BA clusters show almost positive
polarimetric color at all values of scattering angle. We have also made some

regularization for foreground-background separation and denoising on noisy,
moving camera video. Our proposed algorithm registers the raw (possibly
corrupted) frames of a video and then jointly processes the registered frames
to produce a decomposition of the scene into a low-rank background component
that captures the static components of the scene, a smooth foreground component
that captures the dynamic components of the scene, and a sparse component that
can isolate corruptions and other non-idealities. Unlike existing methods, our
proposed algorithm produces a panoramic low-rank component that spans the
entire field of view, automatically stitching together corrupted data from
partially overlapping scenes. The low-rank portion of our robust PCA model is
based on a recently discovered optimal low-rank matrix estimator (OptShrink)
that requires no parameter tuning. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on both static and moving camera videos corrupted by noise and
outliers.

on whether or not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and

has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some
service providers. In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) can exempt data access charges for on content from certain CPs
(zero-rated) while no exemption is on content from other CPs. This allows the
possibility for Content Providers (CPs) to make `sponsorship' agreements to

the effect of differential pricing on various players in the Internet. We first
consider a model with a monopolistic ISP and multiple CPs where users select
CPs based on the quality of service (QoS) and data access charges. We show that
in a differential pricing regime 1) a CP offering low QoS can make have higher
surplus than a CP offering better QoS through sponsorships. 2) Overall QoS
(mean delay) for end users can degrade under differential pricing schemes. In
the oligopolistic market with multiple ISPs, users tend to select the ISP with
lowest ISP resulting in same type of conclusions as in the monopolistic market.
We then study how differential pricing effects the revenue of ISPs.

billions of microvessels that are distributed throughout the animal's body.
Innovative imaging methods now allow for mapping of the architecture and blood
flows within real microvascular networks. However, these data streams have so
far yielded little new understanding of the physical principles that underlie
the organization of microvascular networks, which could allow healthy networks
to be quantitatively compared with networks that have been damaged, e.g. due to
diabetes. A natural mathematical starting point for understanding network
organization is to construct networks that are optimized accordingly to
specified functions. Here we present a method for deriving transport networks
that optimize general functions involving the fluxes and conductances within
the network. In our method Kirchoff's laws are imposed via Lagrange
multipliers, creating a large, but sparse system of auxiliary equations. By
treating network conductances as adiabatic variables, we derive a gradient
descent method in which conductances are iteratively adjusted, and auxiliary
variables are solved for by two inversions of O(N^2) sized sparse matrices. In
particular our algorithm allows us to validate the hypothesis that
microvascular networks are organized to uniformly partition the flow of red
blood cells through vessels. The theoretical framework can also be used to
consider more general sets of objective functions and constraints within
transport networks, including incorporating the non-Newtonian rheology of blood
(i.e. the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect). More generally by forming linear
combinations of objective functions, we can explore tradeoffs between different
optimization functions, giving more insight into the diversity of biological
transport networks seen in nature.

affected by the order of visit of the targets, and by the robot configurations

exploit the classical distinction between task space and configuration space,

dynamical electronic properties of materials. Despite the intensive
developments, the first-principles calculation of CBS for over several hundred
atoms is still computationally demanding. We here propose an efficient and
scalable computational method to calculate CBSs. The basic idea is to express
the Kohn-Sham equation of the real-space grid scheme as a quadratic eigenvalue
problem and compute only the solutions which are necessary to construct the CBS
by Sakurai-Sugiura method. The serial performance of the proposed method shows
a significant advantage in both runtime and memory usage compared to the
conventional method. Furthermore, owing to the hierarchical parallelism in
Sakurai-Sugiura method and the domain-decomposition technique for real-space
grids, we can achieve an excellent scalability in the CBS calculation of a
boron and nitrogen doped carbon nanotube consisting of more than 10,000 atoms
using 2,048 nodes (139,264 cores) of Oakforest-PACS.

Two different types of texture features, namely Wavelet and Local Quantized

statistical based information from signature images. For each writer two
separate one-class support vector machines (SVMs) corresponding to each set of

near the Planck scale $M_\text{P}$. Within this framework, it is important to
examine how little modification is necessary to fit the recent experimental
results in particle physics and cosmology. As a minimal extension, we consider
the possibility that the Higgs field plays the role of inflaton and that the
dark matter is the Higgs-portal scalar field. We assume that the extended
Standard Model is valid up to the string scale $10^{17}\,\text{GeV}$. (This
translates to the assumption that all the non-minimal couplings are not
particularly large, $\xi\lesssim 10^2$, as in the critical Higgs inflation,
since $M_\text{P}/\sqrt{10^2}\sim 10^{17}\,\text{GeV}$.) We find a correlated
theoretical bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the dark matter mass
$m_\text{DM}$. As a result, the Planck bound $r<0.09$ implies that the
dark-matter mass must be smaller than 1.1\,TeV, while the PandaX-II bound on
the dark-matter mass $m_\text{DM}>0.7\pm0.2\,\text{TeV}$ leads to $r\gtrsim
2\times10^{-3}$. Both are within the range of near-future detection. When we
include the right-handed neutrinos of mass $M_\text{R}\sim 10^{14}$\,GeV, the
allowed region becomes wider, but we still predict $r\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ in the
most of the parameter space. The most conservative bound becomes $r>10^{-5}$ if
we allow three-parameter tuning of $m_\text{DM}$, $M_\text{R}$, and the
top-quark mass.

way of measuring the distance to random after $k$ transitions - is generalised
from the classical case to the case of random walks on finite quantum groups.
  A central tool in the study of ergodic random walks on finite groups is the
Upper Bound Lemma of Diaconis and Shahshahani. The Upper Bound Lemma uses the
representation theory of the group to generate upper bounds for the distance to
random and thus can be used to determine convergence rates for ergodic walks.
The representation theory of quantum groups is very well understood and is
remarkably similar to the representation theory of classical groups. This
allows for a generalisation of the Upper Bound Lemma to an Upper Bound Lemma
for quantum groups.
  The Quantum Diaconis--Shahshahani Upper Bound Lemma is used to study the
convergence of ergodic random walks on classical groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$,
$\mathbb{Z}_2^n$, the dual group $\widehat{S_n}$ as well as the `truly' quantum

improvement under the small sample case. Considering the context information in
continuous emotional speech, a Gaussian mixture model embedded with Markov

  A further study is carried out for system robustness analysis. First, noise

unknown emotion types under real situation, an emotion recognition method with
rejection ability is proposed, which enhanced the system compatibility against
unknown emotion samples. Third, coping with the difficulties brought by a large

field sources and the bosonic fields, and the fact that slow-moving bound
states, such as atoms, are not offer waves) dictate that the `slow-moving offer
wave' required for the challenge scenario cannot exist. It is concluded that
issues previously considered obstacles for TI are no longer legitimately viewed
as such, and that reconsideration of the transactional picture is warranted in
connection with solving the measurement problem.

when considering the weak error for standard discretizations of SPDEs of the
form $dX(t)=AX(t)dt+F(X(t))dt+dW(t)$, driven by space-time white noise. In
previous results, test functions are assumed (at least) of class
$\mathcal{C}^2$ with bounded derivatives, and the weak order is twice the

  We prove, in the case $F=0$, that to quantify the speed of convergence, it is
crucial to control some derivatives of the test functions, even when the noise
is non-degenerate. First, the supremum of the weak error over all bounded
continuous functions, which are bounded by $1$, does not converge to $0$ as the
discretization parameter vanishes. Second, when considering bounded Lipschitz
test functions, the weak order of convergence is divided by $2$, i.e. it is not
better than the strong order.
  This is in contrast with the finite dimensional case, where the
Euler-Maruyama discretization of elliptic SDEs $dY(t)=f(Y(t))dt+dB_t$ has weak
order of convergence $1$ even for bounded continuous functions.

distribution based on its $n$ observations arises in many data analysis
contexts. While for $n>p$, the classical sample covariance matrix
$\hat{\Sigma}_n$ is a good estimator for $\Sigma$, it fails in the
high-dimensional setting when $n\ll p$. In this scenario one requires prior
knowledge about the structure of the covariance matrix in order to construct
reasonable estimators. Under the common assumption that $\Sigma$ is sparse, a
refined estimator is given by $M\cdot\hat{\Sigma}_n$, where $M$ is a suitable
symmetric mask matrix indicating the nonzero entries of $\Sigma$ and $\cdot$
denotes the entrywise product of matrices. In the present work we assume that
$\Sigma$ has Toeplitz structure corresponding to stationary signals. This
suggests to average the sample covariance $\hat{\Sigma}_n$ over the diagonals
in order to obtain an estimator $\tilde{\Sigma}_n$ of Toeplitz structure.
Assuming in addition that $\Sigma$ is sparse suggests to study estimators of
the form $M\cdot\tilde{\Sigma}_n$. For Gaussian random vectors and, more
generally, random vectors satisfying the convex concentration property, our
main result bounds the estimation error in terms of $n$ and $p$ and shows that
accurate estimation is indeed possible when $n \ll p$. The new bound
significantly generalizes previous results by Cai, Ren and Zhou and provides an
alternative proof. Our analysis exploits the connection between the spectral
norm of a Toeplitz matrix and the supremum norm of the corresponding spectral
density function.

the quasars; their continuum slopes; the total equivalent width of their

Because of this flyby with the Earth, 2017 FZ2 has become a non-resonant NEA.

quasi-satellite engagements with our planet in the past and it may return as a
co-orbital in the future. We identify a number of NEAs that follow similar
paths, the largest named being YORP, which is also an Earth's co-orbital. An
apparent excess of NEAs moving in these peculiar orbits is studied within the
framework of two orbit population models. A possibility that emerges from this
analysis is that such an excess, if real, could be the result of mass shedding
from YORP itself or a putative larger object that produced YORP. Future
spectroscopic observations of 2017 FZ2 during its next visit in 2018 (and of

steepness as the higher order modifcation of the nonlinear Schroedinger
equation, also referred to as the Dysthe equation. This results in an
asymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order wind
forcing term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory
experiments within the range of the facility's length. We show that the leading
order forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only
a broadening of the spectrum while the asymmetric higher order term in the
model enhances higher frequencies more than lower ones. Thus, the latter term
induces a permanent upshift of the spectral mean. On the other hand, in
contrast to the direct effect of wind forcing, wind can indirectly lead to
frequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such as wave breaking, or
through amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe
equation. Furthermore, the definitions of the up- and downshift in terms of

pre-computed 3D point-set is an important task for many computer vision
applications. Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers are routinely used for camera
pose estimation, provided that a good quality set of 2D-3D feature
correspondences are known beforehand. However, finding optimal correspondences
between 2D key-points and a 3D point-set is non-trivial, especially when only
geometric (position) information is known. Existing approaches to the
simultaneous pose and correspondence problem use local optimisation, and are
therefore unlikely to find the optimal solution without a good pose
initialisation, or introduce restrictive assumptions. Since a large proportion
of outliers are common for this problem, we instead propose a globally-optimal
inlier set cardinality maximisation approach which jointly estimates optimal
camera pose and optimal correspondences. Our approach employs branch-and-bound
to search the 6D space of camera poses, guaranteeing global optimality without
requiring a pose prior. The geometry of SE(3) is used to find novel upper and
lower bounds for the number of inliers and local optimisation is integrated to
accelerate convergence. The evaluation empirically supports the optimality
proof and shows that the method performs much more robustly than existing
approaches, including on a large-scale outdoor data-set.

antiferromagnetic order is most common, ferromagnetism is predicted in

discussed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation on the two-dimensional

extracting the electrons at surrounding Ru sites is phenomenologically taken
into account as a non-magnetic impurity potential which locally destroys the
chiral superconducting order with $p$-wave symmetry giving rise to local
circulating current around $\mu^{+}$ site. It is shown that the size of the
induced local magnetic field in the case with periodic boundary condition is
far smaller compared to the case with open boundary condition without
$\mu^{+}$, in which the surface current induced by destruction of
superconducting order at the surface boundary gives contribution corresponding
to the intrinsic angular momentum of the order of $\hbar N_{\rm s}/2$, with
$N_{\rm s}$ being the number of superconducting electrons. This result
qualitatively explains why the magnetic field $\simeq0.5$G measured by $\mu$SR

involves sensing based on thermal radiation in the Near IR Region, it is
possible to detect Humans from an image captured using a FLIR camera even in

Thermal images by using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature

works in association with the HOG technique. By means of this method, we are
able to reduce execution time, precision and some other parameters, which

  growth rate and size-asymmetric competition",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The large variation in seed mass among species inspired a vast array of
theoretical and empirical research attempting to explain this variation. So
far, seed mass variation was investigated by two classes of studies: one class
focuses on species varying in seed mass within communities, while the second
focuses on variation between communities, most often with respect to resource
gradients. Here, we develop a model capable of simultaneously explaining
variation in seed mass within and between communities. The model describes
resource competition (for both soil and light resources) in annual communities
and incorporates two fundamental aspects: light asymmetry (higher light
acquisition per unit biomass for larger individuals) and growth allometry
(negative dependency of relative growth rate on plant biomass). Results show
that both factors are critical in determining patterns of seed mass variation.
In general, growth allometry increases the reproductive success of small-seeded
species while light asymmetry increases the reproductive success of
large-seeded species. Increasing availability of soil resources increases light
competition, thereby increasing the reproductive success of large-seeded
species and ultimately the community (weighted) mean seed mass. An unexpected
prediction of the model is that maximum variation in community seed mass (a
measure of functional diversity) occurs under intermediate levels of soil
resources. Extensions of the model incorporating size-dependent seed survival
and disturbance also show patterns consistent with empirical observations.
These overall results suggest that the mechanisms captured by the model are
important in determining patterns of species and functional diversity.

training of deep neural networks (DNN). In a typical data parallelism approach,
the local workers push the latest updates of all the parameters to the
parameter server and pull all merged parameters back periodically. However,
with the increasing size of DNN models and the large number of workers in
practice, this typical data parallelism cannot achieve satisfactory training
acceleration, since it usually suffers from the heavy communication cost due to
transferring huge amount of information between workers and the parameter
server. In-depth understanding on DNN has revealed that it is usually highly
redundant, that deleting a considerable proportion of the parameters will not
significantly decline the model performance. This redundancy property exposes a
great opportunity to reduce the communication cost by only transferring the
information of those significant parameters during the parallel training.
However, if we only transfer information of temporally significant parameters
of the latest snapshot, we may miss the parameters that are insignificant now
but have potential to become significant as the training process goes on. To
this end, we design an Explore-Exploit framework to dynamically choose the
subset to be communicated, which is comprised of the significant parameters in
the latest snapshot together with a random explored set of other parameters. We
propose to measure the significance of the parameter by the combination of its
magnitude and gradient. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
Slim-DP can achieve better training acceleration than standard data parallelism
and its communication-efficient version by saving communication time without
loss of accuracy.

systems, the active magnetosphere of a rotating black hole becomes
charge-starved, giving rise to formation of a spark gap in which plasma is
continuously produced. The plasma production process is accompanied by
curvature and inverse Compton emission of gamma rays in the GeV-TeV band, that
may be detectable by current and future experiments. The properties of the gap
emission have been studied recently using a fully general relativistic model of
a local steady gap. However, this model requires artificial adjustment of the
electric current which is determined, in reality, by the global properties of
the magnetosphere. In this paper we map the parameter regime in which steady
gap solutions exist, using a steady-state gap model in Kerr geometry, and show
that such solutions are allowed only under restrictive conditions that may not
apply to most astrophysical systems. We further argue that even the allowed
solutions are inconsistent with the global magnetospheric structure. We
conclude that magnetospheric gaps are inherently intermittent, and point out
that this may drastically change their emission properties.

energising of electrons to relativistic velocities by the explosion and the
existence of a large cool envelope around the accreting white dwarf in

which energises and ejects all the particles in the overlying layers. Our study
results in the following conclusions which are relevant for novae and other
astrophysical systems: (1) Electrons are instantaneously energised to
relativistic velocities in the explosion alongside the heavier atoms and ions.
No post-ejection shock acceleration needs to be invoked. (2) Rotation of an
incompressible spherical accreting object leads to a latitude-dependent
potential such that the accretion rate is maximum at the poles and minimum at
the equator. This will form a prolate-shaped envelope. Energetic expulsion of
this envelope will result in a bipolar ejecta/outflow. Such outflows cannot be
ejected from non-rotating spherical objects. (3) The latitude-dependent
accretion rates in a rotating accreting object will also lead to accumulation
of the infalling matter outside the object in the non-polar regions thus
forming an accretion disk. The angular momentum of the incoming matter plays no
role in the formation of an accretion disk. Accretion disks cannot form around

measured in dileptonic $t\bar{t}$ events produced in 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of
$\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV $pp$ collisions recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.
Both absolute and normalised differential cross-sections are measured, using
events with an opposite-charge $e\mu$ pair and one or two $b$-tagged jets. The
cross-sections are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the detector
acceptance for leptons, and are compared to the predictions from a variety of
Monte Carlo event generators, as well as fixed-order QCD calculations,
exploring the sensitivity of the cross-sections to the gluon parton
distribution function. Some of the distributions are also sensitive to the top
quark pole mass; a combined fit of NLO fixed-order predictions to all the
measured distributions yields a top quark mass value of $m_t^{\rm
pole}=173.2\pm 0.9\pm0.8\pm1.2$ GeV, where the three uncertainties arise from
data statistics, experimental systematics, and theoretical sources.

and time constitute a four-dimensional continuum with pseudo-Euclidean
structure. This has recently begun to be a practically important statement in
accelerator physics. An X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is in fact the best,
exciting example of an engineering system where improvements in accelerator
technology makes it possible to develop ultrarelativistic macroscopic objects
with an internal fine structure, and the theory of relativity plays an
essential role in their description. An ultrarelativistic electron bunch
modulated at nanometer-scale in XFELs has indeed a macroscopic finite-size of
order of 10 $\mu$m. Its internal, collective structure is characterized in
terms of a wave number vector. Here we will show that a four-dimensional
geometrical approach, unusual in accelerator physics, is needed to solve
problems involving the emission of radiation from an ultrarelativistic
modulated electron beam accelerating along a curved trajectory. We will see
that relativistic kinematics enters XFEL physics in a most fundamental way
through the so-called Wigner rotation of the modulation wave number vector,
which is closely associated to the relativity of simultaneity. If not taken
into account, relativistic kinematics effects would lead to a strong
qualitative disagreement between theory and experiments. In this paper, several
examples of relativistic kinematics effects, which are important for current
and future XFEL operation, are studied. The theory of relativity is applied by
providing details of the clock synchronization procedure within the laboratory
frame. This approach, exploited here but unusual in literature, is rather
""practical"", and should be acceptable to accelerator physicists.

are encouraged to interact spontaneously with each other for negotiating the

comfort and time pressure. However, these principles are hard to capture and to
quantify, thus making it difficult to simulate the behavior of road users. This
work investigates traffic conflict situations between pedestrians and motorized
vehicles, with the main objective to formulate a discrete choice model for the
identification of the proper conflict solving strategy. A shared space street
in Hamburg, Germany, with high pedestrian volumes is used as a case study for
model formulation and calibration. Conflict situations are detected by an
automatic procedure of trajectory prediction and comparison. Standard evasive
actions are identified, both for pedestrians and vehicles, by observing
behavioral patterns. A set of potential parameters, which may affect the choice
of the evasive action, is formulated and tested for significance. These include
geometrical aspects, like distance and speed of the conflicting users, as well
as conflict-specific ones, like time to collision. A multinomial logit model is
finally calibrated and validated on real situations. The developed approach is
realistic and ready for implementation in motion models for shared space or any

  Methods. Our $R_0$ estimate was based on fitting the data to the velocity
field expected from the spherical infall model, including effects of the
cosmological constant. The reported uncertainties were derived by a Monte Carlo
simulation.
  Results. Testing various assumptions about a location of the group
barycentre, we found the optimal estimates of the radius to be
$0.91\pm0.05$~Mpc for the Local Group, and $0.93\pm0.02$~Mpc for a synthetic
group stacked from 14 other groups in the Local Volume. Under the standard
Planck model parameters, these quantities correspond to the total mass of the
group $\sim (1.6\pm0.2) 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Thus, we are faced with the
paradoxical result that the total mass estimate on the scale of $R_0 \approx

that wide outskirts of the nearby groups do not contain a large amount of

functionality of complex composite elements. In this letter we study
propagating surface plasmon polaritons in single silver nanowires isolated from
its environment by levitation in a linear Paul trap. Symmetry-breaking effects,
e.g., from supporting substrates are completely eliminated in this way.
Illuminated with white light from a supercontinuum source, Fabry-P\`erot-like
resonances are observed in the scattering spectra obtained from the ends of the
nanowires. The plasmonic nature of the signal is verified by local excitation
and photon collection corresponding to a clean transmission measurement through
a Fabry-P\`erot resonator. A numerical simulation is used to compute the
complex effective refractive indices of the nanowires as input parameter for a
simple Fabry-P\`erot model, which nicely reproduces the measured spectra
despite the highly dispersive nature of the system. Our studies pave the way
for quantitative characterization of nearly any trappable plasmonic nano
object, even of fragile ones such as droplets of liquids or molten metal and of
nearly any nanoresonator based on a finite waveguide with implications for
modeling of complex hybrid structures featuring strong coupling or lasing.
Moreover, the configuration has the potential to be complemented by gas sensors

particles. A new hardware system, designed to analyze event-topologies,
supports a more refined event selection at the Level-1. A hardware-based
high-rate track reconstruction is currently being commissioned. Together with a
re-design of the high-level trigger to deploy more offline-like reconstruction
techniques, these changes improve the performance of the trigger selection
turn-on and efficiency to nearly that of the offline reconstruction. In order
to prepare for the anticipated further luminosity increase of the LHC in
2017/18, improving the trigger performance remains an ongoing endeavor. The
large number of pile-up events is one of the most prominent challenges. This
report gives a short review the ATLAS trigger system and its performance in
2015/16 before describing the significant improvements in selection sensitivity
and pile-up robustness, which we implemented in preparation for the expected
highest ever luminosities of the 2017/18 LHC.

confirm the presence of the close companion. We used near-infrared H -band
aperture synthesis imaging at three epochs in 2014, 2016, and 2017, employing
the PIONIER instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The
visibility data indicate a mean Rosseland angular diameter of 4.1+/-0.8 mas,
corresponding to a radius of 1575+/-400 Rsun. The data show an extended shell
(MOLsphere) of about 2.5 times the Rosseland diameter, which contributes about
30% of the H-band flux. The reconstructed images at the 2014 epoch show a
complex elongated structure within the photospheric disk with a contrast of
about 10%. The second and third epochs show qualitatively and quantitatively
different structures with a single very bright and narrow feature and high
contrasts of 20-30%. This feature is located toward the south-western limb of
the photospheric stellar disk. We estimate an angular size of the feature of
1.7+/-0.3 mas, corresponding to a radius of 650+/-150 Rsun, and giving a radius
ratio of 0.42+0.35/-0.10} compared to the primary stellar disk. We interpret
the images at the 2016 and 2017 epochs as showing the close companion, or a
common envelope toward the companion, in front of the primary. At the 2014
epoch, the close companion is behind the primary and not visible. Instead, the
structure and contrast at the 2014 epoch are typical of a single RSG harboring
giant photospheric convection cells. The companion is most likely a cool giant

at low temperatures is suggested for n-GaAs samples with the donor
concentrations $N_D=10^{14} \div 10^{16}cm^{-3}$ and the compensation degree
$K=\frac{N_A}{N_D}=0.3 \div 0.8$ with acceptors of concentration N_A in the
external magnetic fields up to H=6.5~T. Diagnosis of the BD mechanism was
performed by SI Zeeman and cyclotron resonance photoelectric spectroscopy
methods in the wide interval of the electric field including the BD region too.
The obtained results reveal that the BD electric field $\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ does
not correlate with $K$ and the carriers mobility $\mu$ of the samples, which
contradict to the well-known impact ionization mechanism (IIM). A serious
discrepancy with IIM is that, $\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ does not almost depend on the
magnetic field up to H=6.5~T when $\mathcal{E}\| H$, though the SI ionization
energy increases two times. The cyclotron resonance (CR) measurements show that
the line width does not depend on the electric field for
$\mathcal{E}<\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ indicating the lack of free carriers (FC)
heating in contradiction with IIM. A considerable decrease of the free
carriers' capture cross section (CCS) by ionized SI centers with a subsequent
increase in the FC concentration n is observed by means of PES investigation of
the $1s \to 2p_{+1}$ and CR lines in the electric fields $\mathcal{E} \leq
\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ and at different magnetic fields, applied along $H\|
\mathcal{E}$ or perpendicular $H\perp \mathcal{E}$ to the electric field.
Various effects determined in the PES measurements at $\mathcal{E} =
\mathcal{E}_{BD}$, such as a drastic narrowing the $1s \to 2p_{+1}$ and CR
lines, a shift of the CR line to higher magnetic fields and disappearing of the
lines to higher excited SI states, were clarified to be a result of screening
of SI Coulomb potential by free carriers.

properties are consistent with MSPs having a different evolutionary history to
normal pulsars, viz., neutron-star formation in an evolving binary system and
spin-up due to accretion from the binary companion. Their very stable periods
make MSPs nearly ideal probes of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. For
example, they have been used to detect planets around pulsars, to test the
accuracy of gravitational theories, to set limits on the low-frequency
gravitational-wave background in the Universe, and to establish pulsar-based

companion at a separation of $\approx$400 AU. The envelope structure, including
an equatorial torus and a fast bipolar outflow, is rarely seen in the AGB phase
and is particularly unexpected in such a wide binary system. Therefore a
second, closer companion has been suggested, but the evidence is not
conclusive. The new ALMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J$=3-2 data, together with
previously published $^{12}$CO $J$=2-1 data from the Submillimeter Array (SMA),
and the $^{12}$CO $J$=5-4 and $J$=9-8 lines observed with Herschel/Heterodyne
Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI), is modeled with the 3D non-LTE
radiative transfer code SHAPEMOL. The data analysis clearly confirms the
torus-bipolar structure. The 3D model of the CSE that satisfactorily reproduces
the data consists of three kinematic components: a radially expanding torus
with velocity slowly increasing from 8 to 13 km s$^{-1}$ along the equator
plane; a radially expanding component at the center with a constant velocity of
14 km s$^{-1}$; and a fast, bipolar outflow with velocity proportionally
increasing from 14 km s$^{-1}$ at the base up to 100 km s$^{-1}$ at the tip,
following a linear radial dependence. The results are used to estimate an
average mass-loss rate during the creation of the torus of 7.7$\times$10$^{-7}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The total mass and linear momentum of the fast outflow
are estimated at 7.3$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 9.6$\times$10$^{37}$ g cm
s$^{-1}$, respectively. The momentum of the outflow is in excess (by a factor
of about 20) of what could be generated by radiation pressure alone, in
agreement with recent findings for more evolved sources. The best-fit model
also suggests a $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO abundance ratio of 50. Possible shaping

wide-ranging, involving interventions of many different kinds. As a result,
these therapies are hard to describe. As well as restricting actual practice,
this is also a major impediment to evidence-based medicine as it is hard to
meaningfully compare two treatment plans.
  Ontology development requires significant effort from both ontologists and
domain experts. Knowledge elicited from domain experts forms the scope of the
ontology. The process of knowledge elicitation is expensive, consumes experts'
time and might have biases depending on the selection of the experts. Various
methodologies and techniques exist for enabling this knowledge elicitation,
including community groups and open development practices. A related problem is
that of defining scope. By defining the scope, we can decide whether a concept
(i.e. term) should be represented in the ontology. This is the opposite of
knowledge elicitation, in the sense that it defines what should not be in the
ontology. This can be addressed by pre-defining a set of competency questions.
  These approaches are, however, expensive and time-consuming. Here, we
describe our work toward an alternative approach, bootstrapping the ontology
from an initially small corpus of literature that will define the scope of the
ontology, expanding this to a set covering the domain, then using information
extraction to define an initial terminology to provide the basis and the
competencies for the ontology. Here, we discuss four approaches to building a
suitable corpus that is both sufficiently covering and precise.

the development of agents that perform well against humans in imperfect
information games with partially observable actions. We introduce the
Semi-Determinized-MCTS (SDMCTS), a variant of the Information Set MCTS
algorithm (ISMCTS). More specifically, SDMCTS generates a predictive model of
the unobservable portion of the opponent's actions from historical behavioral
data. Next, SDMCTS performs simulations on an instance of the game where the
unobservable portion of the opponent's actions are determined. Thereby, it
facilitates the use of the predictive model in order to decrease uncertainty.
We present an implementation of the SDMCTS applied to the Cheat Game, a
well-known card game, with partially observable (and often deceptive) actions.
Results from experiments with 120 subjects playing a head-to-head Cheat Game
against our SDMCTS agents suggest that SDMCTS performs well against humans, and
its performance improves as the predictive model's accuracy increases.

each metric on different segments of the movement. Our results highlighted the
importance of segmentation rather than calculating the metrics on the entire

significant differences between experienced surgeons and nonmedical users /

rate of orientation change captures technical aspects that are taught during

utilize distinct times-of-flight for different neutrino mass eigenstates from a
core-collapse supernova to the Earth, which may significantly change the time
distribution of neutrino events in the future huge water-Cherenkov and
liquid-scintillator detectors. For illustration, we consider two different
scenarios. The first case is the neutronization burst of $\nu^{}_e$ emitted in
the first tens of milliseconds of a core-collapse supernova, while the second
case is the black hole formation during the accretion phase for which neutrino
signals are expected to be abruptly terminated. In the latter scenario, it
turns out only when the supernova is at a distance of a few Mpc and the
fiducial mass of the detector is at the level of gigaton, might we be able to
discriminate between normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. In the
former scenario, the probability for such a discrimination is even less due to
a poor statistics.

problems due to the presence of Earth's turbulent atmosphere. Prior to applying

However, the estimation of the quality of images containing complex
photospheric structures is not a trivial task and the standard routines applied
in night-time Lucky Imaging observations are not applicable. In this paper we
evaluate 36 methods dedicated for the assessment of image quality which were
presented in the rich literature over last 40 years. We compare their
effectiveness on simulated solar observations of both active regions and
granulation patches, using reference data obtained by the Solar Optical
Telescope on the Hindoe satellite. To create the images affected by a known
degree of atmospheric degradation, we employ the Random Wave Vector method
which faithfully models all the seeing characteristics. The results provide
useful information about the methods performance depending on the average
seeing conditions expressed by the ratio of the telescope's aperture to the
Fried parameter, $D/r_0$. The comparison identifies three methods for
consideration by observers: Helmli and Scherer's Mean, Median Filter Gradient
Similarity, and Discrete Cosine Transform Energy Ratio. While the first one
requires less computational effort and can be used effectively virtually in any
atmospherics conditions, the second one shows its superiority at good seeing
($D/r_0<4$). The last one should be considered mainly for the post-processing
of strongly blurred images.

type of charge excitations, but by different kinds of charge fluctuations, and
is characterized by a dual structure in the energy space. Low-energy charge
excitations correspond to various types of bond-charge fluctuations driven by
the exchange term (J-term) whereas high-energy charge excitations are due to
usual on-site charge fluctuations and correspond to plasmon excitations above
the particle-hole continuum. The interlayer coupling, which is frequently
neglected in many theoretical studies, is particularly important to the
high-energy charge excitations.

was unusually long-lived and produced 181 flares. Data from the GOES, EVE,
Fermi, Vernov and NoRH observatories were used to determine if QPPs were
present in the flares. For the soft X-ray GOES and EVE data, the time
derivative of the signal was used. Power spectra of the time series data
(without any form of detrending) were inspected, and flares with a peak above
the 95% confidence level in the spectrum were labelled as having candidate
QPPs. The confidence levels were determined taking account of uncertainties and
the possible presence of red noise. AR properties were determined using HMI
line of sight magnetograms. A total of 37 flares (20% of the sample) show good
evidence of having QPPs, and some of the pulsations can be seen in data from
multiple instruments and in different wavebands. The QPP periods show a weak
correlation with the flare amplitude and duration, but this may be due to an
observational bias. A stronger correlation was found between the QPP period and
duration of the QPP signal, which can be partially but not entirely explained
by observational constraints. No correlations were found with the AR area,
bipole separation, or average magnetic field strength. The fact that a
substantial fraction of the flare sample showed evidence of QPPs using a strict
detection method with minimal processing of the data demonstrates that these
QPPs are a real phenomenon, which cannot be explained by the presence of red
noise or the superposition of multiple unrelated flares. The lack of
correlation between the QPP periods and AR properties implies that the
small-scale structure of the AR is important, and/or that different QPP
mechanisms act in different cases.

evolving software systems. For software libraries, we study how library
developers refactor their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), especially
when it impacts client users by breaking an API of the library. Objective: Our
work aims to understand how clients that use a library API are affected by
refactoring activities. We target popular libraries that potentially impact
more library client users. Method: We distinguish between library APIs based on
their client-usage (refereed to as client-used APIs) in order to understand the
extent to which API breakages relate to refactorings. Our tool-based approach
allows for a large-scale study across eight libraries (i.e., totaling 183
consecutive versions) with around 900 clients projects. Results: We find that
library maintainers are less likely to break client-used API classes.
Quantitatively, we find that refactoring activities break less than 37% of all
client-used APIs. In a more qualitative analysis, we show two documented cases
of where non-refactoring API breaking changes are motivated other maintenance
issues (i.e., bug fix and new features) and involve more complex refactoring
operations. Conclusion: Using our automated approach, we find that library
developers are less likely to break APIs and tend to break client-used APIs
when addressing these maintenance issues.

stability of a model polymer chain in a supercooled glass-forming liquid at
different amount of supercooling in order to understand how dynamics of
supercooled liquids influence the collapse behavior of the polymer. Our
systematic computer simulation studies find that apart from long time
relaxation processes ($\alpha$ relaxation), short time dynamics of the
supercooled liquid, known as $\beta$ relaxation plays an important role in
controlling the stability of the model polymer. This is in agreement with some
recent experimental findings. These observations are in stark contrast with the
common belief that only long time relaxation processes are the sole player. We
find convincing evidence that suggest that one might need to review the the
vitrification hypothesis which postulates that $\alpha$ relaxations control the
dynamics of biomolecules and thus $\alpha$-relaxation time should be considered
for choosing appropriate bio-preservatives. We hope that our results will lead
to understand the primary factors in protein stabilization in the context of
bio-preservation.

planets. They are of most importance for terrestrial planets located in the
habitable zone of their host star, where their competition with solid tides is
likely to drive the body towards non-synchronized rotation states of
equilibrium, as observed in the case of Venus. Contrary to other planetary
layers, the atmosphere is sensitive to both gravitational and thermal forcings,
through a complex dynamical coupling involving the effects of Coriolis
acceleration and characteristics of the atmospheric structure. These key
physics are usually not taken into account in modelings used to compute the
evolution of planetary systems, where tides are described with parametrised
prescriptions. In this work, we present a new ab initio modeling of atmospheric
tides adapting the theory of the Earth's atmospheric tides (Chapman & Lindzen
1970) to other terrestrial planets. We derive analytic expressions of the tidal
torque, as a function of the tidal frequency and parameters characterizing the
internal structure (e.g. the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency, the radiative
frequency, the pressure heigh scale). We show that stratification plays a key
role, the tidal torque being strong in the case of convective atmospheres (i.e.
with a neutral stratification) and weak in case of atmosphere convectively
stable. In a second step, the model is used to determine the non-synchronized
rotation states of equilibrium of Venus-like planets as functions of the
physical parameters of the system. These results are detailed in

typical distances. When the underlying age-dependent branching process
approximating the local neighborhoods of vertices is found to produce
infinitely many individuals in finite time -- called explosive branching
process -- Baroni, Hofstad and the second author showed that typical distances
converge in distribution to a bounded random variable. The order of magnitude
of typical distances remained open for the $\tau\in (2,3)$ case when the
underlying branching process is not explosive. We close this gap by determining
the first order of magnitude of typical distances in this regime for arbitrary,
not necessary continuous edge-weight distributions that produce a non-explosive
age-dependent branching process with infinite mean power-law offspring
distributions. This sequence tends to infinity with the amount of vertices,
and, by choosing an appropriate weight distribution, can be tuned to be any
growing function that is $O(\log\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices

accomplished through an Expectation-Maximization method. Extensive experiments
show that our model is capable of producing meaningful scene configurations and
achieving more favorable scene labeling results on two benchmarks (i.e., PASCAL

weakly-supervised deep learning methods. In particular, SYSU-Scenes contains
more than 5000 scene images with their semantic sentence descriptions, which is

Telescope allowed one to resolve the fine structure of many astrospheres. In
particular, they showed that the astrosphere around the B0.7 Ia star kappa Cas
(HD 2905) has a clear-cut arc structure with numerous cirrus-like filaments
beyond it. Previously, we suggested a physical mechanism for the formation of
such filamentary structures. Namely, we showed theoretically that they might
represent the non-monotonic spatial distribution of the interstellar dust in
astrospheres (viewed as filaments) caused by interaction of the dust grains
with the interstellar magnetic field disturbed in the astrosphere due to
colliding of the stellar and interstellar winds. In this paper, we invoke this
mechanism to explain the structure of the astrosphere around kappa Cas. We
performed 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the astrosphere for realistic
parameters of the stellar wind and space velocity. The dust dynamics and the
density distribution in the astrosphere were calculated in the framework of a
kinetic model. It is found that the model results with the classical MRN size
distribution of dust in the interstellar medium do not match the observations,
and that the observed filamentary structure of the astrosphere can be
reproduced only if the dust is composed mainly of big (micron-sized) grains.
Comparison of the model results with observations allowed us to estimate
parameters (number density and magnetic field strength) of the surrounding
interstellar medium.

underlining the recently refined nuclear mass models is based on existing
state-of-the-art models that are subsequently refined through the training of
an artificial neural network. We observe a significant improvement in the
Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) predictions relative to the corresponding ""bare""

of about 400 keV. Given the excellent performance of the BNN refinement in
confronting the recently published AME2016 compilation, we are confident of its
critical role in our quest for mass models of the highest quality. Moreover, as
uncertainty quantification is at the core of the BNN approach, the improved

the resource requirements (time, memory) of CNNs on mobile devices. First, by
deploying several popular CNNs on mobile CPUs and GPUs, we measure and analyze
the performance and resource usage for every layer of the CNNs. Our findings
point out the potential ways of optimizing the performance on mobile devices.
Second, we model the resource requirements of the different CNN computations.

give insights about whether and how e ciently a CNN can be run on a given

strengthen the pillar and the degree of this effect is determined by
orientational order in the initial condition. In addition, while the three

in the local amorphous structure remain robust through the definition of a

The masses and decay widths of the octet pentaquarks are calculated. The widths
are small and comparable with the width of the $P_c(4450)$ pentaquark, and the
masses of the octet pentaquarks satisfy the Gell-Mann-Okubo relation.

$\Sigma_c^*\bar D^*$ deuteronlike states is also considered. We determine
quantum numbers of these bound states and calculate their masses in the
one-pion exchange scenario. The hadroquarkonium and molecular approaches to
exotic hadrons are compared and the relative advantages and drawbacks of each

regards to their size, outer contour (margin) shape, venation, and
pigmentation. The basis of the diversity of wing margin shapes remains unknown,
despite the fact that gene networks governing the Drosophila wing development
have been well characterised. Among the different types of wing margin shapes,
smoothly curved contour is the most frequently found and implies the existence
of a highly organised, multicellular mechanical structure. Here, we developed a
mechanical model for diversified insect wing margin shapes, in which
non-uniform bending stiffness of the wing margin is considered. We showed that
a variety of spatial distribution of the bending stiffness could reproduce
diverse wing margin shapes. Moreover, the inference of the distribution of the
bending stiffness from experimental images indicates a common spatial profile
among insects tested. We further studied the effect of the intrinsic tension of
the wing blade on the margin shape and on the inferred bending stiffness.
Finally, we implemented the bending stiffness of the wing margin in the cell
vertex model of the wing blade, and confirmed that the hybrid model retains the
essential feature of the margin model. We propose that in addition to
morphogenetic processes in the wing blade, the spatial profile of the bending
stiffness in the wing margin can play a pivotal role in shaping insect wings.

to preserve their battery, and hence to increase the lifetime of the network
and foster user participation. A popular strategy for energy saving is duty
cycling. However, when in energy saving mode, users cannot communicate with
each other. The side effects of duty cycling are twofold. On the one hand, duty
cycling may reduce the number of usable contacts for delivering messages,
increasing intercontact times and delays. On the other hand, duty cycling may
break long contacts into smaller contacts, thus also reducing the capacity of
the opportunistic network. Despite the potential serious effects, the role
played by duty cycling in opportunistic networks has been often neglected in
the literature. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we propose a general
model for deriving the pairwise contact and intercontact times measured when a
duty cycling policy is superimposed on the original encounter process
determined only by node mobility. The model we propose is general, i.e., not
bound to a specific distribution of contact and intercontact times, and very
accurate, as we show exploiting two traces of real human mobility for
validation. Using this model, we derive several interesting results about the
properties of measured contact and intercontact times with duty cycling: their
distribution, how their coefficient of variation changes depending on the duty
cycle value, how the duty cycling affects the capacity and delay of an
opportunistic network. The applicability of these results is broad, ranging
from performance models for opportunistic networks that factor in the duty
cycling effect, to the optimisation of the duty cycle to meet a certain target
performance.

coupling as well as the ratio between this coupling and dissipation (i.e.,
cooperativity) of two atoms in an optical cavity. Our method also enables the
generation of steady-state nearly-maximal quantum entanglement. Our approach
exploits optical parametric amplification to exponentially enhance the
atom-cavity interaction and, hence, the cooperativity of the system, with the
squeezing-induced fluctuation noise being completely eliminated. Thus, an
effective cooperativity much larger than $100$ can be achieved even for modest
values of a squeezing parameter. We demonstrate that the entanglement
infidelity (which quantifies the deviation of the generated state from a
maximally-entangled state) is exponentially smaller than the lower bound on the
infidelities obtained in other dissipative entanglement preparations without
applying squeezing. Thus, this infidelity can be arbitrarily small. Our generic
method for enhancing atom-cavity cooperativities can be implemented in a wide
range of physical systems, and it can provide diverse applications for quantum
information processing based on entanglement.

important topic in recent years, as artificial lights and their scattering by
the Earths atmosphere continue spreading around the globe. Several instruments
and techniques have been developed for this task. We give an overview of these,
and discuss their strengths and limitations. The different quantities that can
and should be derived when measuring the night sky brightness are discussed, as
well as the procedures that have been and still need to be defined in this
context. We conclude that in many situations, calibrated consumer digital
cameras with fisheye lenses provide the best relation between ease-of-use and
wealth of obtainable information on the night sky. While they do not obtain
full spectral information, they are able to sample the complete sky in a period
of minutes, with colour information in three bands. This is important, as given
the current global changes in lamp spectra, changes in sky radiance observed
only with single band devices may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding long
term changes in sky brightness. The acquisition of all-sky information is
desirable, as zenith-only information does not provide an adequate
characterization of a site. Nevertheless, zenith-only single-band one-channel
devices such as the Sky Quality Meter continue to be a viable option for
long-term studies of night sky brightness and for studies conducted from a
moving platform. Accurate interpretation of such data requires some
understanding of the colour composition of the sky light. We recommend
supplementing long-term time series derived with such devices with periodic
all-sky sampling by a calibrated camera system and calibrated luxmeters or
luminance meters.

(outliers), their hypothesis generators are not robust to correct image
correspondences (inliers) with positional error (noise). This slows down their
convergence because hypotheses drawn from a minimal set of noisy inliers can
deviate significantly from the optimal model. This work addresses this problem
by introducing ANSAC, a RANSAC-based estimator that accounts for noise by
adaptively using more than the minimal number of correspondences required to
generate a hypothesis. ANSAC estimates the inlier ratio (the fraction of
correct correspondences) of several ranked subsets of candidate correspondences
and generates hypotheses from them. Its hypothesis-generation mechanism
prioritizes the use of subsets with high inlier ratio to generate high-quality
hypotheses. ANSAC uses an early termination criterion that keeps track of the
inlier ratio history and terminates when it has not changed significantly for a
period of time. The experiments show that ANSAC finds good homography and
fundamental matrix estimates in a few iterations, consistently outperforming

common problem in statistical machine learning, such as in factor analysis,
community detection, ranking, matrix completion, among others. While a large
variety of bounds are available for average errors between empirical and
population statistics of eigenvectors, few results are tight for entrywise
analyses, which are critical for a number of problems such as community
detection.
  This paper investigates entrywise behaviors of eigenvectors for a large class
of random matrices whose expectations are low-rank, which helps settle the
conjecture in Abbe et al. (2014b) that the spectral algorithm achieves exact
recovery in the stochastic block model without any trimming or cleaning steps.
The key is a first-order approximation of eigenvectors under the $\ell_\infty$
norm: $$u_k \approx \frac{A u_k^*}{\lambda_k^*},$$ where $\{u_k\}$ and
$\{u_k^*\}$ are eigenvectors of a random matrix $A$ and its expectation
$\mathbb{E} A$, respectively. The fact that the approximation is both tight and
linear in $A$ facilitates sharp comparisons between $u_k$ and $u_k^*$. In
particular, it allows for comparing the signs of $u_k$ and $u_k^*$ even if $\|
u_k - u_k^*\|_{\infty}$ is large. The results are further extended to
perturbations of eigenspaces, yielding new $\ell_\infty$-type bounds for
synchronization ($\mathbb{Z}_2$-spiked Wigner model) and noisy matrix

traversing a congested network: self-interested routing, and system-optimum
routing. In the self-interested routing policy each agent selects a path that
optimizes its own utility, while the system-optimum routing agents are assigned
paths with the goal of maximizing system performance. This paper considers a
scenario where a centralized network manager wishes to optimize utilities over
all agents, i.e., implement a system-optimum routing policy. In many real-life
scenarios, however, the system manager is unable to influence the route
assignment of all agents due to limited influence on route choice decisions.
Motivated by such scenarios, a computationally tractable method is presented
that computes the minimal amount of agents that the system manager needs to
influence (compliant agents) in order to achieve system optimal performance.
Moreover, this methodology can also determine whether a given set of compliant
agents is sufficient to achieve system optimum and compute the optimal route
assignment for the compliant agents to do so. Experimental results are
presented showing that in several large-scale, realistic traffic networks
optimal flow can be achieved with as low as 13% of the agent being compliant
and up to 54%.

combining the phenomenological analyses with the perturbative calculations, we
find the following results: (a) the large decay rates around $10^{-5}$ to
$10^{-6}$ of the $B \to a_1 b_1$ decays dominated by the longitudinal
polarization(except for the $B^+ \to b_1^+ a_1^0$ mode) are predicted and

rather different QCD behaviors between the $a_1$ and $b_1$ mesons result in the
destructive(constructive) contributions in the nonfactorizable spectator

large naive factorization breaking effects are observed in these $B \to a_1

annihilation) amplitudes contribute to the $B^0 \to b_1^+ a_1^-(B^+ \to a_1^+

parameters of a fluctuating noisy signal. However, if the estimation is
performed on unreliable hardware, a sub-optimal estimation procedure can
outperform the previously optimal procedure. Here, we compare classes of
circadian clocks by viewing them as phase estimators for the periodic day-night
light signal. We find that continuous attractor-based free running clocks, such
as those found in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and humans, are
nearly optimal phase estimators since their flat attractor directions
efficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns
(`external noise'). However, such flat directions also make these continuous
limit cycle attractors highly vulnerable to diffusive 'internal noise'. Given
such unreliable biochemical hardware, we find that point attractor-based damped
clocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy
number, Prochlorococcus marinus, outperform continuous attractor-based clocks.
By interpolating between the two types of clocks found in these organisms, we
demonstrate a family of biochemical phase estimation strategies that are best
suited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.

solutions to the ellipsoidal BGK model for polyatomic molecules when the

five years has revolved around the empirical investigation of the importance of
depth, filter sizes, and number of feature channels, recent studies have shown
that branching, i.e., splitting the computation along parallel but distinct
threads and then aggregating their outputs, represents a new promising
dimension for significant improvements in performance. To combat the complexity
of design choices in multi-branch architectures, prior work has adopted simple
strategies, such as a fixed branching factor, the same input being fed to all
parallel branches, and an additive combination of the outputs produced by all
branches at aggregation points.
  In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to
learn the connections between branches in the network. Instead of being chosen
a priori by the human designer, the multi-branch connectivity is learned
simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss
function defined with respect to the end task. We demonstrate our approach on
the problem of multi-class image classification using three different datasets

relatively simple and effective neural joint model that performs both

ad setting, aiming to convert an ad to a structured description, which we name

property (e.g., rooms) from classifieds and (2) structuring them into a tree

two tasks simultaneously and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the
error propagation that would arise from the subtasks one after the other in a
pipelined fashion, and (ii) exploiting the interactions between the subtasks.
For this purpose, we perform an extensive comparative study of the pipeline
methods and the new proposed joint model, reporting an improvement of over
three percentage points in the overall edge F1 score of the property tree.
Also, we propose attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient
tokens during the construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally
demonstrate the usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed
joint model, showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge
F1 score for our application.

research on how games can be designed to promote engagement. This mixed methods
case study aimed to discover effective game elements for promoting 17-18 year
old high school students' engagement with an educational game. Using
within-case and cross-case analyses and triangulated data, 10 elements emerged
and were categorized into the constructs of story, gameplay, and atmosphere.
Examples and connections to the literature for each element are reported.
Findings implicate that educational game design for both learning and

solely engagement is similar for both educational and entertainment games, and
a gap on educational game design technique instead of theory should be

plasma forms even under ultra high vacuum conditions. This phenomenon, known as
vacuum arc, causes catastrophic surface modifications and constitutes a major
limiting factor not only for modern electron sources, but also for many
large-scale applications such as particle accelerators, fusion reactors etc.
Although vacuum arcs have been studied thoroughly, the physical mechanisms that
lead from intense electron emission to plasma ignition are still unclear. In
this article, we give insights to the atomic scale processes taking place in
metal nanotips under intense field emission conditions. We use multi-scale
atomistic simulations that concurrently include field-induced forces, electron
emission with finite-size and space-charge effects, Nottingham and Joule
heating. We find that when a sufficiently high electric field is applied to the
tip, the emission-generated heat partially melts it and the field-induced force
elongates and sharpens it. This initiates a positive feedback thermal runaway
process, which eventually causes evaporation of large fractions of the tip. The
reported mechanism can explain the origin of neutral atoms necessary to
initiate plasma, a missing key process required to explain the ignition of a
vacuum arc. Our simulations provide a quantitative description of in the
conditions leading to runaway, which shall be valuable for both field emission
applications and vacuum arc studies.

cholesterol (CHOL), and free fatty acids (FFA), which are components of the
human skin barrier, are studied via molecular dynamics simulations. Since
mixtures of these lipids exist in dense gel phases with little molecular
mobility at physiological conditions, care must be taken to ensure that the
simulations become decorrelated from the initial conditions. Thus, we propose
and validate an equilibration protocol based on simulated tempering in which
the simulation takes a random walk through temperature space, allowing the
system to break out of metastable configurations and hence become decorrelated
form its initial configuration. After validating the equilibration protocol,
the effects of the lipid composition and ceramide tail length on bilayer
properties are studied. Systems containing pure CER NS, CER NS + CHOL, and CER
NS + CHOL + FFA, with the CER fatty acid tail length varied within each CER
NS-CHOL-FFA composition, are simulated. The bilayer thickness is found to
depend on the structure of the center of the bilayer, which arises as a result
of the tail length asymmetry between the lipids studied. The hydrogen bonding
between the lipid headgroups and with water is found to change with the overall
lipid composition, but is mostly independent of the CER fatty acid tail length.
Subtle differences in the lateral packing of the lipid tails are also found as
a function of CER tail length. Overall, these results provide insight into the
experimentally observed trend of altered barrier properties in skin systems
where there are more ceramides with shorter tails present.
