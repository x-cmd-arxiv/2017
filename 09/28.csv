inversion symmetry about the center of the disk; and an n=4 twin-point design
similar to the n=4 twin-point design observed previously for a square

distant failure in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cervical cancer (CC)
patients. Patients and Methods The shell predictive model was constructed using
pretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) images from 48 NSCLC patients
received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and 52 CC patients
underwent external beam radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy followed
with high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. A shell feature, consisting of
outer voxels around the tumor boundary, was extracted from a series of axial
PET slices. The hypothesis behind this feature is that non-invasive and
invasive tumors may have different morphologic patterns in the tumor periphery,
in turn reflecting the differences in radiological presentations in the PET
images. The utility of the shell was evaluated by the support vector machine
(SVM) classifier in comparison with intensity, geometry, gray level
co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture, neighborhood gray tone difference
matrix (NGTDM) based texture, and a combination of these four features. The
results were assessed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the
area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Results For NSCLC, the AUC
achieved by the shell feature was 0.82 while the highest AUC achieved by the
other features was 0.76. Similarly, for CC, the AUC achieved by the shell
feature was 0.83 while the highest AUC achieved by the other features was 0.76.
Also, the difference in performance between shell and the other features was
significant (P < 0.005) in all cases. Conclusions We propose a boundary-based
shell feature that correlates with tumor metastasis. The shell feature showed
better predictive performance than all the other features for distant failure
prediction in both NSCLC and CC.

the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid,

casual photographers lack the expertise to do this well. To address this
problem, previous works have proposed automatic retouching systems based on
supervised learning from paired training images acquired before and after
manual editing. As it is difficult for users to acquire paired images that
reflect their retouching preferences, we present in this paper a deep learning
approach that is instead trained on unpaired data, namely a set of photographs
that exhibits a retouching style the user likes, which is much easier to
collect. Our system is formulated using deep convolutional neural networks that
learn to apply different retouching operations on an input image. Network
training with respect to various types of edits is enabled by modeling these
retouching operations in a unified manner as resolution-independent
differentiable filters. To apply the filters in a proper sequence and with
suitable parameters, we employ a deep reinforcement learning approach that
learns to make decisions on what action to take next, given the current state
of the image. In contrast to many deep learning systems, ours provides users
with an understandable solution in the form of conventional retouching edits,
rather than just a ""black-box"" result. Through quantitative comparisons and
user studies, we show that this technique generates retouching results
consistent with the provided photo set.

$\dot\gamma t$). We analytically show how this term modifies the force-velocity
dependence close to the critical force, and give the value of $\beta$ in terms
of the analytical properties of the corrugation potential and the scaling

construct geodesics in the space of Kahler cone metrics (cone geodesics). We
next determine the very detailed asymptotic behaviour of constant scalar
curvature Kahler (cscK) cone metrics, which leads to the reductivity of the
automorphism group. Then we establish the linear theory for the Lichnerowicz
operator, which immediately implies the openness of the path deforming the cone
angles of cscK cone metrics. Finally, we address the problem on the uniqueness
of cscK cone metrics and show that the cscK cone metric is unique up to
automorphisms.

In
turn, existing theoretical models often reason about the response of optimal
prices to changing market characteristics without exploiting all available
information about the demand distribution. Our aim is to develop a theory for
the optimization and systematic comparison of prices between different
instances of the same market under various forms of knowledge about the
corresponding demand distributions. We revisit the classic problem of monopoly
pricing under demand uncertainty in a vertical market with an upstream supplier
and multiple forms of downstream competition between arbitrary symmetric
retailers. In all cases, demand uncertainty falls to the supplier who acts
first and sets a uniform price before the retailers observe the realized demand
and place their orders. Our main methodological contribution is that we express
the price elasticity of expected demand in terms of the mean residual demand
(MRD) function of the demand distribution. This leads to a closed form
characterization of the points of unitary elasticity that maximize the
supplier's profits and the derivation of a mild unimodality condition for the
supplier's objective function that generalizes the widely used increasing
generalized failure rate (IGFR) condition. A direct implication is that optimal
prices between different markets can be ordered if the markets can be
stochastically ordered according to their MRD functions or equivalently, their
elasticities. Using the above, we develop a systematic framework to compare
optimal prices between different market instances via the rich theory of
stochastic orders. This leads to comparative statics that challenge previously
established economic insights about the effects of market size, demand
transformations and demand variability on monopolistic prices.

the detector units with enough slant mass to absorb the electromagnetic

allowed, a concept to be implemented in a next generation of UHECR experiments.
The operation of a ground array detector poses challenging demands, as the RPC
must operate remotely under extreme environmental conditions, with limited
budgets for power and minimal maintenance. The RPC, DAQ, High Voltage and
monitoring systems are enclosed in an aluminium-sealed case, providing a
compact and robust unit suited for outdoor environments, which can be easily
deployed and connected. The RPCs developed at LIP-Coimbra are able to operate
using a very low gas flux, which allows running them for few years with a small
gas reservoir. Several prototypes have already been built and tested both in
the laboratory and outdoors. We report on the most recent tests done in the

linear transformation using a linear neural network. In recent years, there has
been a growing interest in the study of such networks in part due to the
successes of deep learning. The main question of this body of research and also
of this paper pertains to the existence and optimality properties of the
critical points of the mean-squared loss function. The primary concern here is
the robustness of the critical points with regularization of the loss function.
An optimal control model is introduced for this purpose and a learning
algorithm (regularized form of backprop) derived for the same using the
Hamilton's formulation of optimal control. The formulation is used to provide a
complete characterization of the critical points in terms of the solutions of a
nonlinear matrix-valued equation, referred to as the characteristic equation.
Analytical and numerical tools from bifurcation theory are used to compute the
critical points via the solutions of the characteristic equation. The main
conclusion is that the critical point diagram can be fundamentally different
even with arbitrary small amounts of regularization.

sufficient conditions for these bounds to be independent of the number of

with arbitrary hanging nodes configurations are considered. The analysis of

the production of heavy elements in the universe, together with a kilonova
signal confirming neutron-star mergers as the origin of short gamma-ray bursts.
We perform full general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron-star mergers
employing three different nuclear-physics EOSs, considering both equal- and
unequal-mass configurations, and adopting a leakage scheme to account for
neutrino radiative losses. Using a combination of techniques, we carry out an
extensive and systematic study of the hydrodynamical, thermodynamical, and
geometrical properties of the matter ejected dynamically, employing the WinNet
nuclear-reaction network to recover the relative abundances of heavy elements
produced by each configurations. Among the results obtained, three are
particularly important. First, we find that both the properties of the
dynamical ejecta and the nucleosynthesis yields are robust against variations
of the EOS and masses, and match very well the observed chemical abundances.
Second, using a conservative but robust criterion for unbound matter, we find
that the amount of ejected mass is $\lesssim 10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}$, hence at
least one order of magnitude smaller than what normally assumed in modelling
kilonova signals. Finally, using a simplified and gray-opacity model we assess
the observability of the infrared kilonova emission finding, that for all
binaries the luminosity peaks around $\sim1/2$ day in the $H$-band, reaching a
maximum magnitude of $-13$, and decreasing rapidly after one day. These rather
low luminosities make the prospects for detecting kilonovae less promising than

implied lower bound on the ionization equilibrium time, 10 years, constrains
the lower limit on the distance to be at least 12 pc, and up to 31 pc, much
less but consistent with the 1 kpc wide starburst ring. The ionization
distribution of column density is reconstructed from measured column densities,
nicely matching results of two 2004 observations, with one large high
ionization parameter ($\xi$) component at $2<\log \xi<3.5$, and one at
$0.5<\log \xi<1$ in cgs units. The strong dependence of the expression for

$L/\mathbb{Q}$ that allows one to count small primes (even as small as an
arbitrarily small power of the discriminant of $L$); this theorem holds for the
Galois closures of ""almost all"" number fields that lie in an appropriate family
of field extensions. Previously, applying Chebotarev in such small ranges
required assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. The error term in this
new Chebotarev density theorem also avoids the effect of an exceptional zero of
the Dedekind zeta function of $L$, without assuming GRH. We give many different
""appropriate families,"" including families of arbitrarily large degree. To do
this, we first prove a new effective Chebotarev density theorem that requires a
zero-free region of the Dedekind zeta function. Then we prove that almost all
number fields in our families yield such a zero-free region. The innovation
that allows us to achieve this is a delicate new method for controlling zeroes
of certain families of non-cuspidal $L$-functions. This builds on, and greatly
generalizes the applicability of, work of Kowalski and Michel on the average
density of zeroes of a family of cuspidal $L$-functions. A surprising feature
of this new method, which we expect will have independent interest, is that we
control the number of zeroes in the family of $L$-functions by bounding the
number of certain associated fields with fixed discriminant. As an application
of the new Chebotarev density theorem, we prove the first nontrivial upper
bounds for $\ell$-torsion in class groups, for all integers $\ell \geq 1$,
applicable to infinite families of fields of arbitrarily large degree.

  Journal of Astrobiology (IJA)",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Saturn's moon Enceladus has vents emerging from a sub-surface ocean, offering
unique probes into the liquid environment. These vents drain into the larger
neutral torus in orbit around Saturn. We present a methanol (CH3OH) detection
observed with IRAM 30-m from 2008 along the line-of-sight through Saturn's
E-ring. Additionally, we also present supporting observations from the Herschel
public archive of water (ortho-H2O; 1669.9 GHz) from 2012 at a similar
elongation and line-of-sight. The CH3OH 5(1,1)-4(1,1) transition was detected
at 5.9 sigma confidence. The line has 0.43 km/s width and is offset by +8.1
km/s in the moon's reference frame. Radiative transfer models allow for gas
cloud dimensions from 1750 km up to the telescope beam diameter ~73000 km.
Taking into account the CH3OH lifetime against solar photodissociation and the
redshifted line velocity, there are two possible explanations for the CH3OH
emission: methanol is primarily a secondary product of chemical interactions
within the neutral torus that (1) spreads outward throughout the E-ring or (2)
originates from a compact, confined gas cloud lagging Enceladus by several
km/s. We find either scenario to be consistent with significant redshifted H2O
emission (4 sigma) measured from the Herschel public archive. The measured
CH3OH:H2O abundance (> 0.5 per cent) significantly exceeds the observed
abundance in the direct vicinity of the vents (~0.01 per cent), suggesting
CH3OH is likely chemically processed within the gas cloud with methane (CH4) as
its parent species.

a deep architecture that integrates a feature extraction subnet and a non-local

strong constraint on the formation mechanisms of blue stragglers. We study the
formation of the blue-straggler binaries through binary evolution, and find
that binary evolution can contribute to the blue stragglers in both of the
sequences. Whether a blue straggler is located in the blue sequence or red
sequence depends on the contribution of the mass donor to the total luminosity
of the binary, which is generally observed as a single star in globular
clusters. The blue stragglers in the blue sequence have a cool white-dwarf
companion, while the majority ($\sim 60\%$) of the objects in the red sequence
are the binaries that are still experiencing mass transfer, but there are also
some objects that the donors have just finished the mass transfer (the
stripped-core stars, $\sim 10\%$) or the blue stragglers (the accretors) have
evolved away from the blue sequence ($\sim 30\%$). Meanwhile, W UMa contact
binaries found in both sequences may be explained by various mass ratios, that
is, W UMa contact binaries in the red sequence have two components with
comparable masses (e.g. mass ratio $q\sim$ 0.3-1.0), while those in the blue
sequence have low mass ratio (e.g. $q<$ 0.3). However, the fraction of blue
sequence in M30 cannot be reproduced by binary population synthesis if we
assumed the initial parameters of a binary sample to be the same as that of the

cascade of fast solar wind is dominated by Alfv\'enic structures, namely
Alfv\'en vortices, with small and/or finite compressive part, with the presence
also of several current sheets aligned with the local magnetic field. Several
examples of vortex chains are also recognized. Although an increase of magnetic
compressibility around ion scales is observed also for fast solar wind, no
strongly compressive structures are found, meaning that the nature of the slow
and fast winds is intrinsically different. Multi-spacecraft analysis applied to
this interval of fast wind indicate that the coherent structures are almost
convected by the flow and aligned with the local magnetic field, i.e. their
normal is perpendicular to {\bf B}, that is consistent with a two dimensional
turbulence picture. Understanding intermittency and the related generation of
coherent structures could provide a key insight into the nonlinear energy
transfer and dissipation processes in magnetized and collisionless plasmas.

type of model. Specific examples for the translationally invariant systems
include Calogero-type many-body systems with balanced loss and gain, where each
particle is interacting with other particles via four-body inverse-square
potential plus pair-wise two-body harmonic terms. A many-body system
interacting via short range four-body plus six-body inverse square potential

box-normalization on the particles having continuous spectra. The normalization
of the ground state wave functions in appropriate Stoke wedges is discussed.
The exact n-particle correlation functions of these two models are obtained
through a mapping of the relevant integrals to known results in random matrix
theory. It is shown that a rotationally symmetric system with generic many-body

the more disordered subsurface layer made of Ge and Sb atoms. Centrally, we
find that the subsurface layer is significantly more ordered than expected for
metastable Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$. Firstly, we show that vacancies are nearly
absent within the subsurface layer. Secondly, the potential fluctuation,
tracked by the spatial variation of the valence band onset, is significantly
less than expected for a random distribution of atoms and vacancies in the
subsurface layer. The strength of the fluctuation is compatible with the
potential distribution of charged acceptors without being influenced by other
types of defects. Thirdly, DFT calculations predict a partially tetrahedral Ge
bonding within a disordered subsurface layer, exhibiting a clear fingerprint in
the local density of states as a peak close to the conduction band onset. This
peak is absent in the STS data implying the absence of tetrahedral Ge, which is
likely due to the missing vacancies required for structural relaxation around
the shorter tetrahedral Ge bonds. Finally, isolated defect configurations with
a low density of $~10^{-4}$/nm$^2$ are identified by comparison of STM and DFT
data, which corroborates the significantly improved order in the epitaxial

this obscuring material have been the subject of intense research in the past
decades, and are still highly debated. A decrease in the covering factor of the
circumnuclear material with increasing accretion rates has been found by
studies carried out across the electromagnetic spectrum. The origin of this
trend has been suggested to be driven either by the increase in the inner
radius of the obscuring material with incident luminosity due to the
sublimation of dust; by the gravitational potential of the black hole; by
radiative feedback; or by the interplay between outflows and inflows. However,
the lack of a large, unbiased and complete sample of accreting black holes,
with reliable information on gas column density, luminosity and mass, has left
the main physical mechanism regulating obscuration unclear. Using a systematic
multi-wavelength survey of hard X-ray-selected black holes, here we show that
radiation pressure on dusty gas is indeed the main physical mechanism
regulating the distribution of the circumnuclear material. Our results imply
that the bulk of the obscuring dust and gas in these objects is located within
the sphere of influence of the black hole (i.e., a few to tens of parsecs), and
that it can be swept away even at low radiative output rates. The main physical
driver of the differences between obscured and unobscured accreting black holes
is therefore their mass-normalized accretion rate.

entity record from all similar or same publication records in scholarly or
similar databases. Typically, a clustering method is used that requires
calculation of similarities between each possible record pair. However, the
total number of pairs grows quadratically with the size of the author database
making such clustering difficult for millions of records. One remedy for this
is a blocking function that reduces the number of pairwise similarity
calculations. Here, we introduce a new way of learning blocking schemes by
using a conjunctive normal form (CNF) in contrast to the disjunctive normal
form (DNF). We demonstrate on PubMed author records that CNF blocking reduces
more pairs while preserving high pairs completeness compared to the previous
methods that use a DNF with the computation time significantly reduced. Thus,
these concepts in scholarly data can be better represented with CNFs. Moreover,
we also show how to ensure that the method produces disjoint blocks so that the
rest of the AND algorithm can be easily paralleled. Our CNF blocking tested on
the entire PubMed database of 80 million author mentions efficiently removes
82.17% of all author record pairs in 10 minutes.

disciplines including epidemiology and the social sciences. Typically, Markov
random field spatial models have been employed to acknowledge spatial
dependence and allow data-driven smoothing. In this paper, we exploit recent
theoretical and computational advances in continuous spatial modeling to carry
out the reconstruction of an underlying continuous spatial surface. In
particular, we focus on models based on stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDEs). We also consider the interesting case in which the aggregate
data are supplemented with point data. We carry out Bayesian inference, and in
the language of generalized linear mixed models, if the link is linear, an
efficient implementation of the model is available via integrated nested
Laplace approximations. For nonlinear links, we present two approaches: a fully
Bayesian implementation using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm, and an
empirical Bayes implementation, that is much faster, and is based on Laplace
approximations. We examine the properties of the approach using simulation, and
then estimate an underlying continuous risk surface for the classic Scottish
lip cancer data.

Advanced LIGO detectors coherently observed a transient gravitational-wave
signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar mass black holes, with a
false-alarm-rate of $\lesssim$ 1 in 27000 years. The signal was observed with a
three-detector network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 18. The inferred
masses of the initial black holes are $30.5_{-3.0}^{+5.7}$ Msun and

investigating signatures of fundamental physics in cosmological observables,
understanding the effect of systematic uncertainties on measured signals and
testing mitigation strategies for reducing these uncertainties, aiding analysis
pipeline development and testing, and survey strategy optimization. The list of
applications is growing with improvements in the quality of the catalogs and
the details that they can provide. Given the importance of simulated catalogs,
it is critical to provide rigorous validation protocols that enable both

enable the inspection, validation, and comparison of an inhomogeneous set of
synthetic catalogs via the provision of a common interface within an automated

highlight several important aspects, both technical and scientific, that
require thoughtful consideration when designing a validation framework,

means of characterising the variability of astronomical sources as a function
of wavelength. While much has been written about the statistics of time and
phase lags, the cospectrum has only recently been understood as means of
mitigating instrumental effects dependent on temporal frequency in astronomical
detectors, as well as a method of characterizing the coherent variability in
two wavelength ranges on different time scales. In this paper, we lay out the
statistical foundations of the cospectrum, starting with the simplest case of
detecting a periodic signal in the presence of white noise. This case is
especially relevant for detecting faint X-ray pulsars in detectors heavily
affected by instrumental effects, including NuSTAR, Astrosat and IXPE. We show
that the statistical distributions of both single and averaged cospectra differ
considerably from those for standard periodograms. While a single cospectrum
follows a Laplace distribution exactly, averaged cospectra are approximated by
a Gaussian distribution only for more than ~30 averaged segments, dependent on
the number of trials. We provide an instructive example of a quasi-periodic
oscillation in NuSTAR and show that applying standard periodogram statistics
leads to underestimated tail probabilities for period detection. We also
demonstrate the application of these distributions to a NuSTAR observation of
the X-ray pulsar Hercules X-1.

breakdown of effective field theory at late time on the event horizon. We
investigate whether or not this happens. For extremal Reissner-Nordstrom we
argue that, for a large class of theories, general covariance ensures that the
higher derivative corrections to the equations of motion appear only in
combinations that remain small compared to two derivative terms so effective
field theory remains valid. For extremal Kerr, the situation is more
complicated since backreaction of the scalar field is not understood even in
the two derivative theory. Nevertheless we argue that the effects of the higher
derivative terms will be small compared to the two derivative terms as long as
the spacetime remains close to extremal Kerr.

a nontrivial gauge holonomy (on the gauge side) generating the vacuum energy.
The effect is global in nature and cannot be formulated in terms of a gradient
expansion in an effective local field theory. We also discuss a graceful exit

with a finite density of either fractons or their dipolar bound states, with a
focus on the $U(1)$ fracton models. We study some of the phases in which
emergent fractonic matter can exist, thereby initiating the study of the
""condensed matter"" of fractons. We begin by considering a system with a finite
density of fractons, which we show can exhibit microemulsion physics, in which
fractons form small-scale clusters emulsed in a phase dominated by long-range
repulsion. We then move on to study systems with a finite density of mobile
dipoles, which have phases analogous to many conventional condensed matter
phases. We focus on two major examples: Fermi liquids and quantum Hall phases.
A finite density of fermionic dipoles will form a Fermi surface and enter a
Fermi liquid phase. Interestingly, this dipolar Fermi liquid exhibits a
finite-temperature phase transition, corresponding to an unbinding transition
of fractons. Finally, we study chiral two-dimensional phases corresponding to
dipoles in ""quantum Hall"" states of their emergent magnetic field. We study
numerous aspects of these generalized quantum Hall systems, such as their edge

be sufficiently heavy during inflation, due to a non-minimal coupling to
gravity, so as to avoid the generation of large isocurvature modes in the CMB
anisotropies spectrum. The field begins oscillating after reheating, behaving
as radiation until the electroweak phase transition and afterwards as
non-relativistic matter. The scalar field becomes unstable, although
sufficiently long-lived to account for dark matter, due to mass mixing with the
Higgs boson, decaying mainly into photon pairs for masses below the MeV scale.
In particular, for a mass of $\sim 7$ keV, which is effectively the only free
parameter, the model predicts a dark matter lifetime compatible with the recent
galactic and extragalactic observations of a 3.5 keV X-ray line.

outside of this region lying below our detection threshold. Two distinct

blueshifted wing has no associated $^{13}$CO(3-2) emission. A simple local
thermodynamic model indicates that the $^{13}$CO emission traces $2.1\times

S=1/2) starting at 50 GPa and not completed even at ~100 GPa. The HS-LS

semiconductor up to 115 GPa and is not expected to be metallic even at about

  We explore a novel approach for 3D printing colored objects, capable of

changing the thickness of the stratum, we change the perceived color at a given

improve quality and allow the use of different numbers of input filaments.

This paper pushes the state-of-the-art by solving the problem for Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) and Renyi entropies.
  While the problem for Markov chains reduces to studying the growth of a
matrix product, computations for HMMs involve \emph{products of random
matrices}. As a result, this case is much harder and no explicit formulas have
been known so far. We show how to circumvent this issue for Renyi entropy of
integer orders, reducing the problem again to a \emph{single matrix products}
where the matrix is formed from transition and emission probabilities by means
of tensor product.
  To obtain results in the asymptotic setting, we use a novel technique for
determining the growth of non-negative matrix powers. The classical approach is
the Frobenius-Perron theory, but it requires positivity assumptions; we instead
work directly with the spectral formula. As a consequence, our results do not
suffer from limitations such as irreducibility and aperiodicity. This improves
our understanding of the entropy rate even for standard (unhidden) Markov
chains.

producing a strong distortion in power density spectra. This can make it
difficult to model the aperiodic variability of the source or look for
quasi-periodic oscillations. Whereas in some instruments a simple a priori
correction for dead-time-affected power spectra is possible, this is not the
case for others such as NuSTAR, where the dead time is non-constant and long
(~2.5 ms). Bachetti et al. 2015 suggested the cospectrum obtained from light
curves of independent detectors within the same instrument as a possible way
out, but this solution has always only been a partial one: the measured rms was
still affected by dead time, because the width of the power distribution of the
cospectrum was modulated by dead time in a frequency-dependent way.
  In this Letter we suggest a new, powerful method to normalize cospectra and,
with some caveats, even power density spectra. Our approach uses the difference
of the Fourier amplitudes from two independent detectors to characterize and
filter out the effect of dead time. This method is crucially important for the

assume that the nodes' positions are independently and identically distributed.
However, this assumption implies the average node degree grows linearly with
the number of nodes, which is inappropriate when the graph is thought to be
sparse. We propose an alternative assumption---that the latent positions are
generated according to a Poisson point process---and show that it is compatible
with various levels of sparsity. Unlike other notions of sparse latent position
models in the literature, our framework also defines a projective sequence of
probability models, thus ensuring consistency of statistical inference across
networks of different sizes. We establish conditions for consistent estimation
of the latent positions, and compare our results to existing frameworks for
modeling sparse networks.

  We fit nonparametric continuous distributions that reproduce the bin counts

active neutrinos, they can be produced at high energy colliders, such as the

lepton pairs, violating lepton number, together with light jets -- $pp\to

once, are a powerful building block in cryptography and would allow for new
forms of secure software distribution. However, ideal one-time programs have
been proved to be unachievable using either classical or quantum resources.
Here we relax the definition of one-time programs to allow some probability of
error in the output and show that quantum mechanics offers security advantages
over purely classical resources. We introduce a scheme for encoding
probabilistic one-time programs as quantum states with prescribed measurement
settings, explore their security, and experimentally demonstrate various
one-time programs using measurements on single-photon states. These include
classical logic gates, a program to solve Yao's millionaires problem, and a
one-time delegation of a digital signature. By combining quantum and classical
technology, we demonstrate that quantum techniques can enhance computing
capabilities even before full-scale quantum computers are available.

  Word-representable graphs generalize several important classes of graphs such

long line of research in the literature dedicated to word-representable graphs.
However, almost nothing is known on word-representability of split graphs, that
is, graphs in which the vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an
independent set. In this paper, we shed a light to this direction. In
particular, we characterize in terms of forbidden subgraphs word-representable
split graphs in which vertices in the independent set are of degree at most 2,
or the size of the clique is 4. Moreover, we give necessary and sufficient
conditions for an orientation of a split graph to be semi-transitive.

polarization data commonly rely on either template cleaning or cross-spectra
between maps at different frequencies to disentangle galactic foregrounds from
the cosmological signal. Assumptions about how the foregrounds scale with
frequency are therefore crucial to interpreting the data. Recent results from
the Planck satellite collaboration claim significant evidence for a
decorrelation in the polarization signal of the spatial pattern of galactic
dust between 353 GHz and 217 GHz. Such a decorrelation would suppress power in
the cross spectrum between high frequency maps, where the dust is strong, and
lower frequency maps, where the sensitivity to cosmological $B$-modes is
strongest. Alternatively, it would leave residuals in lower frequency maps
cleaned with a template derived from the higher frequency maps. If not
accounted for, both situations would result in an underestimate of the dust
contribution and thus an upward bias on measurements of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, $r$. In this paper we revisit this measurement and find that the
no-decorrelation hypothesis cannot be excluded with the Planck data. There are
three main reasons for this: i) there is significant noise bias in cross
spectra between Planck data splits that needs to be accounted for; ii) there is
strong evidence for unknown instrumental systematics whose amplitude we
estimate using alternative Planck data splits; iii) there are significant
correlations between measurements in different sky patches that need to be
taken into account when assessing the statistical significance. Between
$\ell=55-90$ and over $72\%$ of the sky, the dust $BB$ correlation between 217

people with disabilities, such as some older adults. However, robots currently
lack common sense about the physical implications of their actions on people.
The physical implications of dressing are complicated by non-rigid garments,
which can result in a robot indirectly applying high forces to a person's body.
We present a deep recurrent model that, when given a proposed action by the
robot, predicts the forces a garment will apply to a person's body. We also
show that a robot can provide better dressing assistance by using this model
with model predictive control. The predictions made by our model only use
haptic and kinematic observations from the robot's end effector, which are
readily attainable. Collecting training data from real world physical
human-robot interaction can be time consuming, costly, and put people at risk.
Instead, we train our predictive model using data collected in an entirely
self-supervised fashion from a physics-based simulation. We evaluated our
approach with a PR2 robot that attempted to pull a hospital gown onto the arms
of 10 human participants. With a 0.2s prediction horizon, our controller
succeeded at high rates and lowered applied force while navigating the garment
around a persons fist and elbow without getting caught. Shorter prediction
horizons resulted in significantly reduced performance with the sleeve catching
on the participants' fists and elbows, demonstrating the value of our model's
predictions. These behaviors of mitigating catches emerged from our deep
predictive model and the controller objective function, which primarily
penalizes high forces.

Accepted by Algorithmica in 2020",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a graph $H$, a graph $G$ is an $H$-graph if it is an intersection graph
of connected subgraphs of some subdivision of $H$. $H$-graphs naturally
generalize several important graph classes like interval or circular-arc graph.
This class was introduced in the early 1990s by B\'ir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza.
Recently, Chaplick et al. initiated the algorithmic study of $H$-graphs by
showing that a number of fundamental optimization problems are solvable in
polynomial time on $H$-graphs. We extend and complement these algorithmic
findings in several directions.
  First we show that for every fixed $H$, the class of $H$-graphs is of
logarithmically-bounded boolean-width (via mim-width). Pipelined with the
plethora of known algorithms on graphs of bounded boolean-width, this describes
a large class of problems solvable in polynomial time on $H$-graphs. We also
observe that $H$-graphs are graphs with polynomially many minimal separators.
Combined with the work of Fomin, Todinca and Villanger on algorithmic
properties of such classes of graphs, this identify another wide class of
problems solvable in polynomial time on $H$-graphs.
  The most fundamental optimization problems among the problems solvable in
polynomial time on $H$-graphs are Maximum Clique, Maximum Independent Set, and
Minimum Dominating Set. We provide a more refined complexity analysis of these
problems from the perspective of Parameterized Complexity. We show that Maximum
Independent Set and Minimum Dominating Set are W[1]-hard being parameterized by
the size of $H$ plus the size of the solution. On the other hand, we prove that
when $H$ is a tree, then Minimum Dominating Set is fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized (FPT) by the size of $H$. For Maximum Clique we show that it
admits a polynomial kernel parameterized by $H$ and the solution size.

  The conjecture states that a set of small doubling is controlled by a very
structured set, with polynomial dependence of parameters. The ambiguity
concerns the class of structured sets needed. A natural formulation in terms of
generalized arithmetic progressions was recently disproved by Lovett and Regev.
A more permissive alternative is in terms of \emph{convex progressions}; this
avoids the obstruction, but uses is a significantly larger class of objects,
yielding a weaker statement.

rigorously, fulfilling fundamental properties of quantum field-theory
amplitudes such as analyticity and unitarity, and are in agreement with the
low-energy behaviour predicted by effective theories of QCD. They are derived
from sets of coupled-channel equations using $T$-matrix elements constrained by
experimental meson-meson phase shifts and inelasticities, chiral symmetry and
asymptotic QCD. We provide explicit amplitude expressions for the decays $B^\pm

entropy production. We bound the rate of change of the entropy of a driven
non-equilibrium steady state relative to the underlying equilibrium state in
terms of the flow of probability through the boundary of the process.
  We then consider open Markov processes as morphisms in a symmetric monoidal
category by splitting up their boundary states into certain sets of `inputs'

Markov process onto the inputs of another so that the probability flowing out
of the first process is equal to the probability flowing into the second. We
construct a `black-box' functor characterizing the behavior of an open Markov
process in terms of the space of possible steady state probabilities and
probability currents along the boundary. The fact that this is a functor means
that the behavior of a composite open Markov process can be computed by
composing the behaviors of the open Markov processes from which it is composed.

stability analysis is based on a linearisation of the fully-coupled
fluid-structure system of equations. The calculated equilibria are steady-state
solutions of the fully-coupled nonlinear equations. By implementing this
approach, we (i) explore the mechanisms that initiate flapping, (ii) study the
role of vortex shedding and vortex-induced vibration (VIV) in large-amplitude
flapping, and (iii) characterise the chaotic flapping regime. For point (i), we
identify a deformed-equilibrium state and show through a global stability
analysis that the onset of flapping is due to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation.
For large-amplitude flapping, point (ii), we confirm the arguments of Sader et
al. (2016) that for a range of parameters this regime is a VIV. We also show
that there are other flow regimes for which large-amplitude flapping persists
and is not a VIV. Specifically, flapping can occur at low Reynolds numbers
($<50$), albeit via a previously unexplored mechanism. Finally, with respect to
point (iii), chaotic flapping has been observed experimentally for Reynolds
numbers of $O(10^4)$, and here we show that chaos also persists at a moderate
Reynolds number of 200. We characterise this chaotic regime and calculate its
strange attractor, whose structure is controlled by the above-mentioned
deformed equilibria and is similar to a Lorenz attractor. These results are
contextualised with bifurcation diagrams that depict the different equilibria
and various flapping regimes.

patterns, which often display synchrony during slow-wave sleep or under certain
anesthetics and stay asynchronous during quiet wakefulness. The mechanisms
behind these cortical states and transitions among them are not completely
understood. Here we study spontaneous population activity patterns in random
networks of spiking neurons of mixed types modeled by Izhikevich equations.
Neurons are coupled by conductance-based synapses subject to synaptic noise. We
localize the population activity patterns on the parameter diagram spanned by
the relative inhibitory synaptic strength and the magnitude of synaptic noise.
In absence of noise, networks display transient activity patterns, either
oscillatory or at constant level. The effect of noise is to turn transient
patterns into persistent ones: for weak noise, all activity patterns are
asynchronous non-oscillatory independently of synaptic strengths; for stronger
noise, patterns have oscillatory and synchrony characteristics that depend on
the relative inhibitory synaptic strength. In the region of parameter space
where inhibitory synaptic strength exceeds the excitatory synaptic strength and
for moderate noise magnitudes networks feature intermittent switches between
oscillatory and quiescent states with characteristics similar to those of
synchronous and asynchronous cortical states, respectively. We explain these
oscillatory and quiescent patterns by combining a phenomenological global
description of the network state with local descriptions of individual neurons
in their partial phase spaces. Our results point to a bridge from events at the
molecular scale of synapses to the cellular scale of individual neurons to the
collective scale of neuronal populations.

results to be compared with reduced systematic uncertainties. These data should
provide the best test of lepton universality in a scattering experiment to

scattering with both particle polarities will allow a test of two-photon
exchange at the sub-percent level, about a factor of four improvement on
uncertainties and over an order of magnitude more data points than previous low
momentum transfer determinations, and similar to the current generation of
higher momentum transfer electron experiments. The experiment has the potential
to demonstrate whether the $\mu p$ and $ep$ interactions are consistent or
different, and whether any difference results from novel physics or two-photon
exchange. The uncertainties are such that if the discrepancy is real it should
be confirmed with $\approx$5$\sigma$ significance, similar to that already

Specifically, we are interested in the distribution of a diffusion coefficient
of an elliptic PDE. In this setting, the sample space is high-dimensional, and
each sample of the PDE solution is expensive. To address these issues we
propose and analyse a novel Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for the
approximation of the posterior distribution. Classical, single-level SMC
constructs a sequence of measures, starting with the prior distribution, and
finishing with the posterior distribution. The intermediate measures arise from
a tempering of the likelihood, or, equivalently, a rescaling of the noise. The
resolution of the PDE discretisation is fixed. In contrast, our estimator
employs a hierarchy of PDE discretisations to decrease the computational cost.
We construct a sequence of intermediate measures by decreasing the temperature
or by increasing the discretisation level at the same time. This idea builds on
and generalises the multi-resolution sampler proposed in [P.S. Koutsourelakis,
J. Comput. Phys., 228 (2009), pp. 6184-6211] where a bridging scheme is used to
transfer samples from coarse to fine discretisation levels. Importantly, our
choice between tempering and bridging is fully adaptive. We present numerical

management of the future smart grid. However, to meet the requirements of
deploying the future grid at a large scale, the state estimation algorithm must
be able to accomplish two major tasks: (1) combining measurement data with
different qualities to attain an optimal state estimate and (2) dealing with
the large number of measurement data rendered by meter devices. To address
these two tasks, we first propose a practical solution using a very short word
length to represent a partial measurement of the system state in the meter
device to reduce the amount of data. We then develop a unified probabilistic
framework based on a Bayesian belief inference to incorporate measurements of
different qualities to obtain an optimal state estimate. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms other linear
estimators in different test scenarios. These findings indicate that the
proposed scheme not only has the ability to integrate data with different
qualities but can also decrease the amount of data that needs to be transmitted

infrastructure (ICI) such as power, natural gas, and water systems is a
challenging task due to their interdependence and a large number of involved
sensors. In this paper, using a novel integrated state-space model that
captures the interdependence, a two-stage cyber attack on an ICI is studied in
which the attacker first compromises the ICI's sensors by decoding their
messages, and, subsequently, it alters the compromised sensors' data to cause
state estimation errors. To thwart such attacks, the administrator of each
critical infrastructure (CI) must assign protection levels to the sensors based
on their importance in the state estimation process. To capture the
interdependence between the attacker and the ICI administrator's actions and
analyze their interactions, a Colonel Blotto game framework is proposed. The
mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of this game is derived analytically. At this
equilibrium, it is shown that the administrator can strategically randomize
between the protection levels of the sensors to deceive the attacker.
Simulation results coupled with theoretical analysis show that, using the
proposed game, the administrator can reduce the state estimation error by at
least $ 50\% $ compared to a non-strategic approach that assigns protection
levels proportional to sensor values.

the high cost of repetitive QM computations for changing coordinates of atoms

for Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization Problem (MCOP). In this paper, an
enhanced PLS variant called Parallel Pareto Local Search based on Decomposition
(PPLS/D) is proposed. PPLS/D improves the efficiency of PLS using the
techniques of parallel computation and problem decomposition. It decomposes the
original search space into L subregions and executes L parallel processes
searching in these subregions simultaneously. Inside each subregion, the PPLS/D
process is guided by a unique scalar objective function. PPLS/D differs from
the well-known Two Phase Pareto Local Search (2PPLS) in that it uses the scalar
objective function to guide every move of the PLS procedure in a fine-grained
manner. In the experimental studies, PPLS/D is compared against the basic PLS
and a recently proposed PLS variant on the multiobjective Unconstrained Binary
Quadratic Programming problems (mUBQPs) and the multiobjective Traveling
Salesman Problems (mTSPs) with at most four objectives. The experimental
results show that, no matter whether the initial solutions are randomly
generated or generated by heuristic methods, PPLS/D always performs
significantly better than the other two PLS variants.

charge order arises from the inter-site charge interaction and the collective
motion of three localized electrons on the hexagon plaquettes. This model leads
naturally to a reduction of the local moments by 2/3 as observed in
LiZn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Furthermore, at low temperatures each hexagon plaquette
contains an extra orbital-like degree of freedom in addition to the remaining
spin 1/2. We explore the consequence of this emergent orbital degree of
freedom. We point out the interaction between the local moments is naturally
described by a Kugel-Khomskii spin-orbital model. We develop a parton approach

equations can be used to study the behaviour at the cylinder, where the
solutions turn out to have logarithmic singularities at infinitely many orders.
We derive regularity conditions that may be imposed on the initial data, in
order to avoid the first singular terms. We then demonstrate that the fully
pseudospectral time evolution scheme can be applied to this problem leading to
a highly accurate numerical reconstruction of the nonsymmetric solutions. We
are particularly interested in the behaviour of the solutions at future null
infinity, and we numerically show that the singularities spread from the
cylinder to null infinity. The observed numerical behaviour is consistent with
similar logarithmic singularities found analytically on the cylinder. Finally,
we demonstrate that even solutions with singularities at low orders can be
obtained with high accuracy by virtue of a coordinate transformation that
converts functions with logarithmic singularities into smooth solutions.

background of stochastic magnetic field. Also, we found a realization of a
cyclic Universe, free of initial singularity, due to the proposed NED energy
density. In addition, we explore whether a NED field without or with matter can
be the origin of the late-time acceleration. For this we obtain explicit
equations for $H(z)$ and perform a MCMC analysis to constrain the NED
parameters by using $31$ observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained from cosmic
chronometers covering the redshift range $0 < z < 1.97$; and with the
joint-light-analysis (JLA) SNIa compilation consisting in $740$ data points in
the range $0.01<z<1.2$. All our constraints on the current magnetic field give
$B_{0}\sim 10^{-31}\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which are larger than the upper limit
$10^{-33}\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ by the Planck satellite implying that NED
cosmologies could not be suitable to explain the Universe late-time dynamics.
However, the current data is able to falsify the scenario at late times.
Indeed, one is able to reconstruct the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ using the
best fit values of the parameters obtained from OHD and SNIa data sets. If the
matter component is not included, the data sets predict an accelerated phase in
the early Universe, but a non accelerated Universe is preferred in the current

usually attributed to a two-step process: atmospheric levitation by

AGB stars may be triggered by photon scattering on Fe-free silicates with grain
sizes of about 0.1 - 1 $\mu$m. Due to the low grain temperature, these Fe-free
silicates can condense close to the star, but they do not produce the
characteristic mid-IR features that are often observed in M-type AGB stars.
However, it is probable that the silicate grains are gradually enriched with Fe
as they move away from the star, to a degree where the grain temperature stays
below the sublimation temperature, but is high enough to produce emission
features. We investigate whether differences in grain temperature in the inner
wind region, which are related to changes in the grain composition, can be
detected with current interferometric techniques, in order to put constraints
on the wind mechanism. To investigate this we use radial structures of the
atmosphere and wind of an M-type AGB star, produced with the 1D
radiation-hydrodynamical code DARWIN. The spectral energy distribution is found
to be a poor indicator of different temperature profiles and therefore is not a
good tool for distinguishing different scenarios of changing grain composition.
However, spatially resolved interferometric observations have promising
potential. They show signatures even for Fe-free silicates (found at 2-3
stellar radii), in contrast to the spectral energy distribution. Observations
with baselines that probe spatial scales of about 4 stellar radii and beyond
are suitable for tracing changes in grain composition, since this is where
effects of Fe enrichment should be found.

originate in a hot corona lying above a cold, geometrically thin accretion
disk. A highly concentrated corona located within $\sim10$ gravitational radii
above the black hole is inferred from observations. Based on the accretion of
interstellar medium/wind, a disk corona model has been proposed in which the
corona is well coupled to the disk by radiation, thermal conduction, as well as
by mass exchange \citep{Liu2015, Qiao2017}. Such a model avoids artificial
energy input to the corona and has been used to interpret the spectral features
observed in AGN. In this work, it is shown that the bulk emission size of the
corona is very small for the extended accretion flow in our model. More than
80\% of the hard X-ray power is emitted from a small region confined within 10
Schwarzschild radii around a non-spinning black hole, which is expected to be
even smaller accordingly for a spinning black hole. Here, the corona emission
is more extended at higher Eddington ratios. The compactness parameter of the
corona, $l={L\over R}{\sigma_{\rm T}\over m_{\rm e} c^3}$, is shown to be in
the range of 1-33 for Eddington ratios of 0.02 - 0.1. Combined with the
electron temperature in the corona, this indicates that electron--positron pair
production is not dominant in this regime. A positive relation between the
compactness parameter and photon index is also predicted. By comparing the
above model predictions with observational features, we find that the model is
in agreement with observations.

the first-order transition from the short period domain structure, which
appears in the Meissner state, into the long period domain structure with
spontaneous vortices. It is the first experimental observation of this scenario
in the ferromagnetic superconductors. Low-temperature phase is characterized by
much larger domains in V-AV state and peculiar branched striped structures at
the surface, which are typical for uniaxial ferromagnets with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The domain wall parameters at various temperatures
are estimated.

neutrinos from NDAFs leads to GRB variability, NDAFs can be regarded as the
sources of the strong gravitational waves (GWs). We calculate the dependences
of the GW strains on both the BH spin and the accretion rate. We demonstrate
that for typical GRBs with either single pulse or multiple pulses, the GWs from
NDAFs might be detected at a distance of $\sim 100$ kpc/$\sim 1$ Mpc by
advanced LIGO/Einstein Telescope with a typical frequency of $\sim 10-100$ Hz.

NDAFs'. We find that for a certain GRB, the possible detected distance from
NDAFs is about two orders of magnitude higher than that from BZ mechanism, but
at least two orders of magnitude lower than that from magnetars. The typical GW
frequency for BZ mechanism is the same with that of NDAFs, $\sim 10-100$ Hz,
while the typical frequency for magnetars is $\sim 2000$ Hz. Therefore, the GWs
released by the central engines of adjacent GRBs might be used to determine
whether there is an NDAF, a BZ jet or a magnetar in GRB center.

Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-divergence, and Wasserstein distance, and
choosing an appropriate distance measure is very important for training the
generative network. In this paper, we choose to use the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the distance metric, which has several nice theoretical
guarantees. In fact, generative moment matching network (GMMN) (Li, Swersky,

network $G$ trained by directly minimizing MMD between the real and generated
distributions. However, it fails to generate meaningful samples on challenging
benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and LSUN. To improve on GMMN, we propose
to add an extra network $F$, called mapper. $F$ maps both real data
distribution and generated data distribution from the original data space to a
feature representation space $\mathcal{R}$, and it is trained to maximize MMD
between the two mapped distributions in $\mathcal{R}$, while the generator $G$
tries to minimize the MMD. We call the new model generative adversarial mapping

the structures and electronic spectra of two periodic GBs in graphene on highly

parallel periodic dislocation cores of pentagonal-heptagonal (5-7) carbon rings
gives rise to an enhanced localized state at 0.45 eV above the Dirac point in
graphene surfaces, which is attributed to van Hove singularities (VHSs).
Moreover, the energy positions of the localized states are varied between 0.40
and 0.47 eV depending on the site and eventually decayed to 0.36 eV. The
variation of the energy positions is induced by two parallel GBs because of the
higher electron density at the GB as a defect center and the lower electron
away from the GB. Another periodic GB with a symmetric zigzag structural
feature induced VHSs at -0.038 and 0.12 eV near the Fermi level. Moreover,
intervalley scattering was observed on both these GBs. This means that carrier
concentration and thus, the conductance around the periodic GBs can be
significantly enhanced by localized density of states. This finding suggests
that graphene with a properly embedded ordered GB is promising for improving
the performance of graphene-based electronic devices.

the realized TBP represents a monotonically increasing frontier on the
risk-return plane, where the equally weighted portfolio (EWP) of all ten stocks
plays a role in their lower bound. This shows the availability of TBPs in
targeting specific risk-return levels, and an EWP based on all the assets plays
a role in the reference portfolio of TBPs. In the process, thresholds play
dominant roles in characterizing risk, return, and the prediction accuracy of
the subset. The TBP is more data-driven in designing portfolio target risk and
return than existing ones, in the sense that it requires no prior knowledge of
finance such as financial assumptions, financial mathematics, or expert
insights. In a practical application, we present the TBP management procedure
for a time horizon extending over multiple time periods; we also discuss their
application to mean-variance portfolios to reduce estimation risk.

not uniformly distributed, but obeys a well defined power law distribution with
smaller digits appearing more often. Among one of the myriad particle physics
datasets available, we find that the leading decimal digit for the $\tau$
lepton branching fraction shows marginal disagreement with the logarithmic
behavior expected from the Benford distribution. We quantify the deviation from
Benford's law using a $\chi^2$ function valid for binomial data, and obtain a
$\chi^2$ value of 16.9 for nine degrees of freedom, which gives a $p$-value of
about 5%, corresponding to a 1.6$\sigma$ disagreement. We also checked that the
disagreement persists under scaling the branching fractions, as well as by
redoing the analysis in a numerical system with a base different from 10. Among
all the digits, `9' shows the largest discrepancy with an excess of $4\sigma$.
This discrepancy is because the digit `9' is repeated for three distinct groups
of correlated modes, with each group having a frequency of two or three,
leading to double-counting. If we count each group of correlated modes only
once, the discrepancy for this digit also disappears and we get pristine
agreement with Benford distribution.

which support the existence of more than one phase transition in the pressure

induces significant changes in the electronic band gap and phonon spectrum of
CaMoO4. We have determined the pressure evolution of the band gap for the low-

the Raman-active and infrared-active modes. In addition, based upon
calculations of the phonon dispersion of the scheelite phase, carried out at a
pressure higher than the transition pressure, we propose a possible mechanism
for the reported phase transition. Furthermore, from the calculations we
determined the pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters and atomic
positions of the different phases and their room-temperature equations of

been continuously debated. These different scenarios have profoundly different
implications for Mars' climatic history, and thus for its habitability in the

landscapes with more surface runoff branch at narrower angles, while in humid
environments with more groundwater flow, branching angles are much wider. We
find that valley networks on Mars generally tend to branch at narrow angles
similar to those found in arid landscapes on Earth. This result supports the
inference that Mars once had an active hydrologic cycle and that Mars' valley
networks were formed primarily by overland flow erosion with groundwater
seepage playing only a minor role.

introducing fidelity temperature to properly quantify quantum fluctuations,
which, together with fidelity entropy and fidelity internal energy, constitute
three basic state functions in fidelity mechanics, thus enabling us to
formulate analogues of the four thermodynamic laws and Landauer's principle at
zero temperature. Fidelity flows are defined and may be interpreted as an
alternative form of renormalization group flows. Thus, both stable and unstable
fixed points are characterized in terms of fidelity temperature and fidelity
entropy: divergent fidelity temperature for unstable fixed points and zero
fidelity temperature and (locally) maximal fidelity entropy for stable fixed
points. In addition, an inherently fundamental role of duality is clarified,
resulting in a canonical form of the Hamiltonian in fidelity mechanics.
Dualities, together with symmetry groups and factorizing fields, impose the
constraints on a fidelity mechanical system, thus shaping fidelity flows from
an unstable fixed point to a stable fixed point.

extraction of the top quark pole mass ($m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{pole}}$) at
next-to-leading order (NLO) is presented. This result is obtained from
normalised differential cross-sections in the $t\bar{t}\to\mbox{dilepton}$

addition, measurements of $m_{\mathrm{top}}$ are discussed that are based on
the template method performed in three $t\bar{t}$ decay channels. For all
results the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects. Finally, the 2016
ATLAS combined value of $m_{\mathrm{top}}$ is: $m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.84 \pm

materials a versatile platform for extreme light confinement and tailored
nanophotonics. Graphene and its heterostructures have attracted particular
attention because the absence of an energy gap allows for plasmon polaritons to
be continuously tuned. Here, we introduce black phosphorus (BP) as a promising
new material in surface polaritonics that features key advantages for ultrafast
switching. Unlike graphene, BP is a van der Waals bonded semiconductor, which
enables high-contrast interband excitation of electron-hole pairs by ultrashort
near-infrared (near-IR) pulses. We design a SiO$_2$/BP/SiO$_2$ heterostructure
in which the surface phonon modes of the SiO$_2$ layers hybridize with surface
plasmon modes in BP that can be activated by photo-induced interband
excitation. Within the Reststrahlen band of SiO$_2$, the hybrid interface
polariton assumes surface-phonon-like properties, with a well-defined frequency
and momentum and excellent coherence. During the lifetime of the photogenerated
electron-hole plasma, coherent polariton waves can be launched by a broadband
mid-IR pulse coupled to the tip of a scattering-type scanning near-field
optical microscopy (s-SNOM) setup. The scattered radiation allows us to trace
the new hybrid mode in time, energy, and space. We find that the surface mode
can be activated within ~50 fs and disappears within 5 ps, as the electron-hole
pairs in BP recombine. The excellent switching contrast and switching speed,
the coherence properties, and the constant wavelength of this transient mode
make it a promising candidate for ultrafast nanophotonic devices.

task in biological and medical data processing. Large-scale, multi-institution
clinical studies are the typical examples of such datasets. These sets make
possible the search for multi-parametric relations since from the plenty of the
data one is likely to find a satisfying number of subjects with the required
parameter ensembles. Specifically, finding combinatorial biomarkers for some
given condition also needs a very large dataset to analyze. For this goal,
statistical regression analysis is not the preferred tool of choice, since (i)
the {\em a priori} knowledge of the parameter-sets to analyze is missing, and
(ii) typically relatively few subjects have the interesting parameter-value
ensembles for the analysis. For fast and automatic multi-parametric relation
discovery association-rule finding tools are used for more than two decades in
the data-mining community. Here we present the SCARF webserver for {\em
generalized} association rule mining. Association rules are of the form: $a$
AND $b$ AND ... AND $x \rightarrow y$, meaning that the presence of properties
$a$ AND $b$ AND ... AND $x$ implies property $y$; our algorithm finds
generalized association rules, since it also finds logical disjunctions (i.e.,
ORs) at the left-hand side, allowing the discovery of more complex rules in a
more compressed form in the database. This feature also helps reducing the
typically very large result-tables of such studies, since allowing ORs in the
left-hand side of a single rule could include dozens of classical rules. The
capabilities of the SCARF algorithm were demonstrated in mining the Alzheimer's

object's property (\textit{e.g} polarisation, spin, etc.) can be separated from
its physical body or \textit{disembodied}. This conclusion arose from an
argument that interprets a zero weak value (WV) of polarisation as no
polarisation. We show that this argument is incomplete in the sense that a zero
WV reading could equally be interpreted as linear polarisation. Nevertheless,
through a generalisation of the QCC, we complete their argument by excluding
the possibility of linear polarisation as a consistent interpretation. We go
further, and introduce the dual of the generalised QCC. The dual QCC exhibits
an intriguing effect, where a horizontally-polarised interferometer with just
one arm, can give rise to interference which is vertically-polarised. The
interference appears to arise as the result of the phase difference between the
physical arm and a \textit{phantom} arm. This peculiar effect arises from the
interplay between the pre-selected and post-selected states, which
characterises WVs. The QCC has not yet been unambiguously experimentally
demonstrated. The QCC dual offers an alternative pathway to experimental
realisation.

dynamic pricing strategies to maximize their profits. In this article, we
formulate the pricing problem as a continuous-time stochastic optimal control
problem and find the optimal policy by solving the associated
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We propose a new approach to modelling
the randomness in the dynamics of sales based on diffusion processes. The model
assumes a continuum approximation to the stock levels of the retailer which
should scale much better to large-inventory problems than the existing Poisson
process models in the revenue management literature. The diffusion process
approach also enables modelling of the demand volatility, whereas Poisson
process models do not.
  We present closed-form solutions to the HJB equation when there is no
randomness in the system. It turns out that the deterministic pricing policy is
near-optimal for systems with demand uncertainty. Numerical errors in
calculating the optimal pricing policy may, in fact, result in a lower profit
on average than with the heuristic pricing policy.

N\'eel walls stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
whose strength increases going from Pt to Al top layers. This is explained by
the presence of DMI with opposite sign at the Pt/Co and Co/M interfaces, the
latter increasing in strength going towards heavier atoms, possibly due to the
increasing spin-orbit interaction. This work shows that in non-centrosymmetric

above the polarity inversion line (PIL) similar to Moore et al study. Velocity
field derived from tracked magnetograms indicates persistent shear and
converging motions of polarity regions about the PIL. While these shear motions
continue, the crossed arms of two sigmoid elbows are being brought to
interaction by converging motions at the middle of PIL, initiating
tether-cutting reconnection of field lines and the onset of CME explosion. The
successive CMEs are explained by a cyclic process of magnetic energy storage
and release terming ""sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid"" transformation driven by
photospheric flux motions. Further, the continued shear motions inject helicity
flux of dominant negative sign, which contributes to core field twist and its
energy by building a twisted flux rope (FR). After a limiting value, the excess
coronal helicity is expelled by bodily ejection of the FR initiated by some
instability as realized by intermittent CMEs. This AR is in contrast to the
confined AR12192 with predominant negative signed larger helicity flux but very
weaker (-0.02turns) normalised coronal helicity content. While predominant
signed helicity flux is a requirement for CME eruption, our study suggests the
magnetic flux normalized helicity flux as a necessary condition accommodating
the role of background flux and appeals a further study of large sample of ARs.

Moreover, considering the specific example of the quantum Rabi model, we show
that the multi-mode description of the electromagnetic field, necessary to

differ radically from their single-mode counterparts already for moderate
values of the coupling. Our multi-mode analysis also reveals phenomena of
fundamental interest on the dynamics of the intracavity electric field, where a
free photonic wavefront and a bound state of virtual photons are shown to
coexist.

technique uses a kernel function to rebuild the probability density and
therefore, at a difference with the approximation presented in the original

possibility of performing quantum ground state searches with steepest descent
methods as well as real time quantum molecular dynamics simulations.

of papers that discussed the non-linear gauge-fixing condition and quark
confinement. I also correct some errors, which do not detract from the key
findings, found in the original papers. However, there are two major
corrections I will make in this paper, the first is on the proof of the
Parisi-Sourlas mechanism and the second is on the effective action for the
'gluons', which leads to a direct proof of gluons being confined inside
hadrons. The correction also leads to how the mass gap will be calculated,
which was explicitly done in 2D.
  The starting point is that contrary to the prevailing ideas in the
literature, the Coulomb gauge is an incomplete gauge-fixing condition in the
sense that there are field configurations that cannot be gauge transformed to
the Coulomb gauge. In other words the orbit of these configurations will not
intersect the Coulomb gauge surface. I proposed the non-linear gauge condition
precisely because it includes the Coulomb gauge in the high energy (short
distance) regime and the quadratic regime (the large distance regime where the
running coupling becomes large), where the gauge fields cannot be gauge
transformed to the Coulomb surface. We proposed a new decomposition of the
gauge potential in the non-linear regime, which involves an isoscalar (the
divergence of the gauge field) and a new vector field, which exhibits a mass
gap and confinement. When we add the quarks, we find that they are localized to
a given distance scale and has an effective four-Fermi action with a linear
potential. Thus, we have shown a mass gap for gluons and confinement for both
dynamical quarks and gluons.

Advanced preprocessing and classification of data at the network edge can help
to decrease the communication demand and to reduce the amount of data to be

combination of algorithms with a high classification rate and

  Classification","9 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifiers are traditionally
designed to have sequential convolutional layers with a single output layer.
This is based on the assumption that all target classes should be treated
equally and exclusively. However, some classes can be more difficult to
distinguish than others, and classes may be organized in a hierarchy of
categories. At the same time, a CNN is designed to learn internal
representations that abstract from the input data based on its hierarchical
layered structure. So it is natural to ask if an inverse of this idea can be
applied to learn a model that can predict over a classification hierarchy using
multiple output layers in decreasing order of class abstraction. In this paper,
we introduce a variant of the traditional CNN model named the Branch
Convolutional Neural Network (B-CNN). A B-CNN model outputs multiple
predictions ordered from coarse to fine along the concatenated convolutional
layers corresponding to the hierarchical structure of the target classes, which
can be regarded as a form of prior knowledge on the output. To learn with
B-CNNs a novel training strategy, named the Branch Training strategy
(BT-strategy), is introduced which balances the strictness of the prior with
the freedom to adjust parameters on the output layers to minimize the loss. In
this way we show that CNN based models can be forced to learn successively
coarse to fine concepts in the internal layers at the output stage, and that
hierarchical prior knowledge can be adopted to boost CNN models' classification
performance. Our models are evaluated to show that the B-CNN extensions improve
over the corresponding baseline CNN on the benchmark datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100.

brightest flares that have been recorded from Sagittarius A*. They all exhibit
an asymmetric shape consistent with a combination of two intrinsically separate
peaks that occur at a certain time-delay with respect to each other, and are
characterized by their mutual flux ratio and the profile of raising/declining
parts. Such asymmetric shapes arise naturally in the scenario of a temporary
flash from a source orbiting near a super- massive black hole, at radius of
only 10-20 gravitational radii. An interplay of relativistic effects is
responsible for the modulation of the observed light curves: Doppler boosting,
gravitational redshift, light focusing, and light-travel time delays. We find
the flare properties to be in agreement with the simulations (our ray-tracing
code sim5lib). The inferred mass for each of the flares comes out in agreement
with previous estimates based on orbits of stars; the latter have been observed
at radii and over time-scales two orders of magnitude larger than those typical
for the X-ray flares, so the two methods are genuinely different. We test the
reliability of the method by applying it to another object, namely, the Seyfert

  type spaces","25pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the Boltzmann equation near global Maxwellians in the
$d$-dimensional whole space. A unique global-in-time mild solution to the
Cauchy problem of the equation is established in a Chemin-Lerner type space
with respect to the phase variable $(x,v)$. Both hard and soft potentials with
angular cutoff are considered. The new function space for global well-posedness
is introduced to essentially treat the case of soft potentials, and the key
point is that the velocity variable is taken in the weighted supremum norm, and
the space variable is in the $s$-order Besov space with $s\geq d/2$ including
the spatially critical regularity. The proof is based on the time-decay
properties of solutions to the linearized equation together with the bootstrap
argument. Particularly, the linear analysis in case of hard potentials is due
to the semigroup theory, where the extra time-decay plays a role in coping with
initial data in $L^2$ with respect to space variable. In case of soft
potentials, for the time-decay of linear equations we borrow the results basing
on the pure energy method and further extend them to those in $L^\infty$
framework through the technique of $L^2$--$L^\infty$ interplay. In contrast to
hard potentials, $L^1$ integrability in $x$ of initial data is necessary for
soft potentials in order to obtain global solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy
problem.

probability kernels are used to model these interactions in a patchy
environment. A linear stability analysis of the model shows that solutions to
this equation exhibit pattern formation if the dispersal rate of the species is
sufficiently small and the discrete interaction kernel satisfies certain

patterns arise near critical dispersal rate. We use weakly nonlinear analysis
to better understand the behavior of formed patterns. We show that observed
patterns arise through both supercritical and subcritical bifurcations from

transitions to instability, we also show that there exists a threshold for the

we address this question by using the CoSphere model as introduced in de
Fromont & Alimi (2017a). We derive their exact statistics in both primordial
and non linearly evolved Universe for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We first
compute the full joint Gaussian probability distribution for the various
parameters describing these profiles in the Gaussian Random Field. We recover
the results of Bardeen et al. (1986) only in the limit where the compensation
radius becomes very large, i.e. when the central extremum decouples from its
cosmic environment. We derive the probability distribution of the compensation
size in this primordial field. We show that this distribution is redshift
independent and can be used to model cosmic void size distribution.
Interestingly, it can be used for central maximum such as DM haloes. We compute
analytically the statistical distribution of the compensation density in both
primordial and evolved Universe. We also derive the statistical distribution of
the peak parameters already introduced by Bardeen et al. (1986) and discuss
their correlation with the cosmic environment. We thus show that small central
extrema with low density are associated with narrow compensation regions with a
small $R_1$ and a deep compensation density $\delta_1$ while higher central
extrema are located in larger but smoother over/under massive regions.

well understood extremes of ergodic flow and quantum completely integrable

  Hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space decompose into finitely many
invariant subsets, only some of which are of ergodic character. It has been
conjectured by Percival that the eigenfunctions of the quantisation of this
system decompose into associated families of analogous character. The first
project in this thesis proves a weak form of this conjecture for a class of
dynamical billiards, namely the mushroom billiards of Bunimovich for a full
measure subset of a shape parameter $t\in (0,2]$.
  KAM Hamiltonian systems arise as perturbations of completely integrable
Hamiltonian systems. The dynamics of these systems are well understood and have
near-integrable character. The classical-quantum correspondence suggests that
the quantisation of KAM systems will not have quantum ergodic character. The
second project in this thesis proves an initial negative quantum ergodicity
result for a class of positive Gevrey perturbations of a Gevrey Hamiltonian

combining resilience techniques across various layers of the system stack
(circuit, logic, architecture, software, algorithm). This is also referred to
as cross-layer resilience. In this paper, we focus on radiation-induced soft
errors in processor cores. We address both single-event upsets (SEUs) and
single-event multiple upsets (SEMUs) in terrestrial environments. Our framework
automatically and systematically explores the large space of comprehensive
resilience techniques and their combinations across various layers of the

cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at minimal costs, and
provides guidelines for the design of new resilience techniques. Our results
demonstrate that a carefully optimized combination of circuit-level hardening,
logic-level parity checking, and micro-architectural recovery provides a highly
cost-effective soft error resilience solution for general-purpose processor
cores. For example, a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate is
achieved at only 2.1% energy cost for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an
in-order core) with no speed impact. However, (application-aware) selective
circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis of the effects of
soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a cost-effective soft error
resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional energy cost for a 50x
improvement in silent data corruption rate).

the quantum deformed Universe is a quantized minisuperspace model constructed
from quantum Heisenberg-Weyl $\mathcal U_q(h_4)$ and $\mathcal U_q(su(1, 1))$

scale factor, the scalar field and corresponding momenta are quantized and
($ii$) the phase space has a non-equidistance lattice structure. On the other
hand, such quantum group structure provides us a new framework to discuss the
cosmological constant problem. Subsequently, we show that a ultraviolet cutoff
can be obtained at $10^{-3} eV$, i.e., at a scale much larger than the expected
Planck scale. In addition, an infrared cutoff, at the size of the observed
Universe, emerges from within such quantum deformation of Universe. In other
words, the spectrum of the scale factor is upper bounded. Moreover, we show
that the emerged cosmological horizon is a quantum sphere $S^2_q$ or,
alternatively, a fuzzy sphere $S^2_F$ which explicitly exhibits features of the
holographic principle. The corresponding number of fundamental cells equals the
dimension of the Hilbert space and hence, the cosmological constant can be

is a key component for security-centric computer vision systems. Despite that
the convolutional neural networks are remarkable in learning discriminative
features from images, the learning of comprehensive features of pedestrians for
fine-grained tasks remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a new
attention-based deep neural network, named as HydraPlus-Net (HP-net), that
multi-directionally feeds the multi-level attention maps to different feature
layers. The attentive deep features learned from the proposed HP-net bring
unique advantages: (1) the model is capable of capturing multiple attentions
from low-level to semantic-level, and (2) it explores the multi-scale
selectiveness of attentive features to enrich the final feature representations
for a pedestrian image. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed HP-net for pedestrian analysis on two tasks, i.e. pedestrian attribute
recognition and person re-identification. Intensive experimental results have
been provided to prove that the HP-net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
on various datasets.

the economical 3-3-1 models, symmetry breaking is achieved effectively with two
scalar triplets so that the spectrum of scalar particles at the TeV scale
contains just two CP even scalars, one of which is the recently discovered
Higgs boson, plus a charged scalar. Such a scalar sector is simpler than the
one in the Two Higgs Doublet Model, hence more attractive for phenomenological
studies, and has no FCNC mediated by scalars except for the ones induced by the
mixing of SM fermions with heavy fermions. We identify a global residual
symmetry of the model which guarantees mass degeneracies and some massless
fermions whose masses need to be generated by the introduction of effective
operators. The fermion masses so generated require less fine-tuning for most of
the SM fermions and FCNC are naturally suppressed by the small mixing between
the third family of quarks and the rest. The effective setting is justified by
an ultraviolet completion of the model from which the effective operators

probability of an event occurring is influenced by the history of the process.
In particular, self-exciting spatio-temporal models allow for spatial
dependence as well as temporal self-excitation. For large spatial or temporal
regions, however, the model leads to an intractable likelihood. An increasingly
common method for dealing with large spatio-temporal models is by using Laplace
approximations (LA). This method is convenient as it can easily be applied and
is quickly implemented. However, as we will demonstrate in this manuscript,
when applied to self-exciting Poisson spatial-temporal models, Laplace
Approximations result in a significant bias in estimating some parameters. Due
to this bias, we propose using up to sixth-order corrections to the LA for
fitting these models. We will demonstrate how to do this in a Bayesian setting
for Self-Exciting Spatio-Temporal models. We will further show there is a
limited parameter space where the extended LA method still has bias. In these
uncommon instances we will demonstrate how a more computationally intensive
fully Bayesian approach using the Stan software program is possible in those
rare instances. The performance of the extended LA method is illustrated with
both simulation and real-world data.

is derived from first principles. It captures the crossover from viscous to
elastic dynamics at an idealized liquid to glass transition and explains the
emergence of long-ranged stress correlations in glass, as expected from
classical continuum elasticity. The long-ranged stress correlations can be
traced to the coupling of shear stress to transverse momentum, which is ignored
in the classic Maxwell model. To rescue this widely used model, we suggest a
generalization in terms of a single relaxation time $\tau$ for the fast degrees
of freedom only. This generalized Maxwell model implies a divergent correlation
length $\xi\propto\tau$ as well as dynamic critical scaling and correctly
accounts for the far-field stress correlations. It can be rephrased in terms of
generalized hydrodynamic equations, which naturally couple stress and momentum
and furthermore allow to connect to fluidity and elasto-plastic models.

Prior research was focused on the misuse of cryptography and SSL APIs, but did

conducted a comprehensive empirical study on StackOverflow posts to understand
developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming obstacles, and

cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to
configure Spring security. More interestingly, we identified security
vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers. The vulnerabilities
included using insecure hash functions such as MD5, breaking SSL/TLS security

nonlinear crystals pumped by laser light. The use of a laser pump makes the
occurrence of induced (stimulated) emission unavoidable and the effect of
stimulated emission can be observed in the joint detection rate of the two

a role in inducing the coherence. Here we investigate a case in which the
crystals are pumped with a single-photon Fock state. We find that coherence is
induced even though the possibility of stimulated emission is now fully ruled
out. Furthermore, the joint detection rate of the two beams becomes ideally
zero and does no longer change with the pump power. We illustrate our results
by numerical simulations and by comparisons with experimental findings. Our
results rule out any classical or semi-classical explanation of the phenomenon

properties of both the disk and the perturbing planets. Gaps in debris disks
may indicate a planet physically present within the gap, but such gaps can also
occur away from the planet's orbit at mean-motion resonances (MMRs), and this
is the focus of our interest here. We extend our study of planet-disk
interaction through MMRs, presented in an earlier paper, to systems in which
the perturbing planet has moderate orbital eccentricity, a common occurrence in
exoplanetary systems. In particular, a new result is that the 3:1 MMR becomes
distinct at higher eccentricity, while its effects are absent for circular
planetary orbits. We also only consider gravitational interaction with a
planetary body of at least 1 Jupiter mass. Our earlier work shows that even a 1
Earth mass planet can theoretically open an MMR gap; however, given the narrow
gap that can be opened by a low-mass planet, its observability would be
questionable. We find that the widths, locations, and shapes of two prominent
structures, the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs, could be used to determine the mass,
semimajor axis, and eccentricity of the planetary perturber and present an
algorithm for doing so. These MMR structures can be used to narrow the position

sources have relied on spontaneous parametric processes such as down-conversion
(SPDC) and four-wave mixing (SFWM). These processes are mediated by vacuum
fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Therefore, by manipulating the
electromagnetic mode structure, for example, using nanophotonic systems, one
can engineer the spectrum of generated photons. However, such manipulations are
susceptible to fabrication disorders which are ubiquitous in nanophotonic
systems and lead to device-to-device variations in the spectrum of generated

perturbations. The advantage of working with the classified higher derivative
terms is that we can control both the background and the perturbation equations
allowing us to construct the higher derivative extension of mimetic dark matter
and the mimetic nonsingular bouncing scenarios. The latter can be thought as a
new higher derivative effective action for the loop quantum cosmology scenario
in which the equations of motion coincide with those suggested by loop quantum
cosmology. We investigate a possible connection between the mimetic cosmology
and the Randall-Sundrum cosmology.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with frequency about a Hz in their optical
luminosity. These Hz-frequency QPOs are thought to be generated by intensity
variations of the emitted radiation originating at the post-shock accretion
column. Thermal instability in the post-shock region, triggered by efficient
cooling process at the base, is believed to be the primary reason behind the
temporal variability. Here we study the structure and the dynamical properties
of the post-shock accretion column including the effects of bremsstrahlung and
cyclotron radiation. We find that the presence of significant cyclotron
emission in optical band reduces the overall variability of the post-shock
region. In the case of a larger post-shock region above the stellar surface,
the effects of stratification due to stellar gravity becomes important. An
accretion column, influenced by the strong gravity, has a smaller variability
as the strength of the thermal instability at the base of the column is
reduced. On the other hand, the cool, dense plasma, accumulated just above the
stellar surface, may enhance the post-shock variability due to the propagation
of magnetic perturbations. These characteristics of the post-shock region are
consistent with the observed properties of V834~Cen and in general with
Cataclysmic Variable sources that exhibit QPO frequency of about a Hz.

construct a family of phase-inversion-symmetric materials with variable

we design disordered stealthy hyperuniform dispersion that possesses nearly
optimal effective conductivity while being statistically isotropic.

theory, and many-body perturbation theory, within the plane-wave
pseudo-potential and projector-augmented-wave approaches. Quantum ESPRESSO owes
its popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to
simulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware
architectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities
as a core open-source development platform to implement theirs ideas. In this
paper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new
methodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code
modularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and

infinite mass constraint. When an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux is present, e.g.,
through the center of the ring domain, persistent currents, i.e., permanent
currents without dissipation, can arise. In real materials, impurities and
defects are inevitable, raising the issue of robustness of the persistent
currents. Using localized random potential to simulate the disorders, we
investigate how the ensemble averaged current magnitude varies with the
disorder density. For comparison, we study the nonrelativistic quantum
counterpart by analyzing the solutions of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation under
the same geometrical and disorder settings. We find that, for the Dirac ring
system, as the disorder density is systematically increased, the average
current decreases slowly initially and then plateaus at a finite nonzero value,
indicating remarkable robustness of the persistent currents. The physical
mechanism responsible for the robustness is the emergence of a class of
boundary states - whispering gallery modes. In contrast, in the Schr\""{o}dinger
ring system, such boundary states cannot form and the currents diminish rapidly
to zero with increase in the disorder density. We develop a physical theory
based on a quasi one-dimensional approximation to understand the striking
contrast in the behaviors of the persistent currents in the Dirac and
Schr\""{o}dinger rings. Our 2D Dirac ring systems with disorders can be
experimentally realized, e.g., on the surface of a topological insulator with
natural or deliberately added impurities from the fabrication process.

whether parameters can be recovered from data, for linear compartmental models.
Using standard differential algebra techniques, the question of whether a given
model is generically locally identifiable is equivalent to asking whether the
Jacobian matrix of a certain coefficient map, arising from input-output
equations, is generically full rank. A natural next step is to study the set of
parameter values where the Jacobian matrix drops in rank, which we refer to as
the locus of non-identifiable parameter values, or, for short, the singular
locus. In this work, we give a formula for coefficient maps in terms of acyclic
subgraphs of the model's underlying directed graph and, then, study the case
when the singular locus is defined by a single equation, the singular-locus
equation. We prove that the singular-locus equation can be used to determine
when submodels are generically locally identifiable. We also determine the
singular-locus equation for two families of linear compartmental models, cycle
and mammillary (star) models with input and output in a single compartment. We
also state a conjecture for the corresponding equation for a third family:
catenary (path) models. Finally, we introduce the identifiability degree, which
is the number of parameter values that map to a generic input-output data
vector. This degree was previously computed for mammillary and catenary models,
and here we determine this degree for cycle models.

theory with 12 flavors of unimproved staggered fermions, the scaling of the
imaginary part of the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling

great deal of recent attention. In these materials, the energy band contains of
a pair of Dirac cones and a flat band through the connecting point of the
cones. As the ""caging"" of carriers with a zero group velocity, the flat band
itself has zero conductivity. However, in a non-equilibrium situation where a
constant electric field is suddenly switched on, the flat band can enhance the
resulting current in both the linear and nonlinear response regimes through
distinct physical mechanisms. Using the ($2+1$) dimensional pseudospin-$1$
Dirac-Weyl system as a concrete setting, we demonstrate that, in the weak field
regime, the interband current is about twice larger than that for
pseudospin-1/2 system due to the interplay between the flat band and the
negative band, with the scaling behavior determined by the Kubo formula. In the
strong field regime, the intraband current is $\sqrt{2}$ times larger than that
in the pseudospin-1/2 system, due to the additional contribution from particles
residing in the flat band. In this case, the current and field follows the
scaling law associated with Landau-Zener tunneling. These results provide a
better understanding of the role of the flat band in non-equilibrium transport
and are experimentally testable using electronic or photonic systems.

(QCM) to measure the mass of a gas absorbed on and in the metal electrode on
the quartz oscillator, when the gas pressure is low and the gas can be
considered as rigidly attached to the metal, so viscosity effects are
negligible. This provides an absolute measure of the total mass of gas uptake
as a function of time, which can be used to model the kinetic processes
involved. The technique can measure diffusion parameters of gases in metals
close to room temperature at gas pressures much below one atmosphere, as
relevant to surface processes such as atomic layer deposition and model studies
of heterogeneous catalysis, whereas traditional diffusion measurements require
temperatures over 400oC at gas pressures of at least a few Torr. A strong
aspect of the method is the ability to combine the bulk measurement of absorbed
mass by a QCM with a surface-sensitive technique such as Auger electron
spectroscopy in the same vacuum chamber. The method is illustrated using atomic
oxygen, formed under O2 gas at 6x10-5 Torr in the presence of a hot tungsten
filament, interacting with the gold electrode on a QCM crystal held at 52 to
120oC. Some of the incident oxygen forms a surface oxide which eventually
blocks more uptake, and the rest, about 80%, indiffuses. Surprisingly, the rate
of oxygen uptake initially increases with the amount of oxygen previously
absorbed; therefore, the measured oxygen uptake with time is reproducible only
if pre-adsorption of oxygen conditions the sample. Temperatures above 130oC are
necessary for measurable thermal desorption, but all the oxygen can be removed
by CO scavenging at all temperatures of these experiments. Simple kinetic
models are developed for fitting the experimental data to extract relevant
parameters.

highlights optimized bifacial PV for a few geographic locations or develops
worldwide performance maps for very specific configurations, such as the
vertical installation. It is still difficult to translate these location- and
configuration-specific conclusions to a general optimized performance of this
technology. In this paper, we present a global study and optimization of
bifacial solar modules using a rigorous and comprehensive modeling framework.
Our results demonstrate that with a low albedo of 0.25, the bifacial gain of
ground-mounted bifacial modules is less than 10% worldwide. However, increasing
the albedo to 0.5 and elevating modules 1 m above the ground can boost the
bifacial gain to 30%. Moreover, we derive a set of empirical design rules,
which optimize bifacial solar modules across the world, that provide the
groundwork for rapid assessment of the location-specific performance. We find
that ground-mounted, vertical, east-west-facing bifacial modules will
outperform their south-north-facing, optimally tilted counterparts by up to 15%
below the latitude of 30 degrees, for an albedo of 0.5. The relative energy
output is the reverse of this in latitudes above 30 degrees. A detailed and

an axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field. We use polytropes of the indices
$n\sim1$ as background equilibrium models of neutron stars where we ignore the
deformation due to the magnetic fields. For a poloidal magnetic field,
axisymmetric normal modes of non-rotating stars are decoupled into spheroidal
modes and toroidal modes, and we can treat spheroidal modes separately from
toroidal modes. For the surface field strength $B_S$ ranging from $10^{14}$G to
$10^{16}$G, we calculate axisymmetric spheroidal magnetic modes whose
oscillation frequency is proportional to $B_S$. The typical oscillation
frequency of the magnetic modes is $\sim 0.01\times\sqrt{GM/R^3}$ for $B_S\sim
10^{15}$G, where $M$ and $R$ are respectively the mass and radius of the star
and $G$ is the gravitational constant. For $M=1.4M_\odot$ and $R=10^6$cm, this
frequency is $\sim 20$Hz, which may explain low frequency QPOs found for SGR
1806-204 and SGR 1900+14. We also find modes of frequency $> \sqrt{GM/R^3}$
corresponding to the radial fundamental and first harmonic modes. No unstable
magnetic modes are found for axisymmetric spheroidal oscillations of magnetized
stars.

present two variants of the algorithm. The ""efficient query"" variant involves
the query time of $O(d^2)$ and the polynomial pre-processing time. The

a block 2 by 2 non-linear system, where the p1, 1q block has a non-linear and
non-smooth term. Recently a globally convergent Newton Schur method was
proposed for the non-linear Schur complement corresponding to this non-linear
system. The solver may be seen as an inexact Uzawa method which has the falvour
of an active set method in the sense that the active sets are first identified
by solving a quadratic obstacle problem corresponding to the p1, 1q block of
the block 2 by 2 nonlinear system, and a new decent direction is obtained after
discarding the active set region. The problem becomes linear on nonactive set,
and corresponds to solving a linear saddle point problem on truncated domains.
For solving the quadratic obstacle problem, various optimal multigrid like
methods have been proposed. In this paper solvers for the truncated saddle
point problem is considered. Three preconditioners are considered, two of them
have block diagonal structure, and the third one has block tridiagonal
structure. One of the block diagonal preconditioners is obtained by adding
certain scaling of stiffness and mass matrices, whereas, the remaining two
involves Schur complement. Eigenvalue bound and condition number estimates are
derived for the preconditioned untruncated problem. It is shown that the
extreme eigenvalues of the preconditioned truncated system remain bounded by
the extreme eigenvalues of the preconditioned untruncated system. Numerical
experiments confirm the optimality of the solvers.

($\mathcal{R}_0^H$) and overall reproduction number for the system
$\mathcal{R}_0= \max\{\mathcal{R}_0^T, \mathcal{R}_0^H\}$ are computed. The

supercritical transcritical bifurcation at $\mathcal{R}_0^T=1$ and
$\mathcal{R}_0^H=1$ whereas the parameters $\beta^*=\beta e$ and

Mathematical analysis of our model shows that successful disease eradication
requires treatment of single disease, that is, treatment for HIV only and TB
only infected individuals with addition to co-infection treatment and in
absence of which disease eradication is extremely difficult even for
$\mathcal{R}_0<1$. When both the diseases are epidemic, the treatment for TB
only infected individuals is very effective in reducing the total infected
population and disease-induced deaths in comparison to the treatment for HIV
infected individuals while these are minimum when both the single disease
treatments are given with co-infection treatment.

the proposition that, according to the scheme theory, the manifold M is locally
isomorphic to the spectrum of the algebra A, M = Spec(A), where A is the
commutative algebra of distributions of quantum-field densities. In order to
determine the algebra A, it is necessary to define multiplication on densities
and to eliminate those densities, which cannot be multiplied. This leads to
essential restrictions imposed on densities and on space-time properties. It is
found that the only possible case, when the commutative algebra A exists, is
the case, when the quantum fields are in the spacetime manifold M with the
structure group SO(3,1) (Lorentz group). The algebra A consists of
distributions of densities with singularities in the closed future light cone
subset. On account of the local isomorphism M = Spec(A), the quantum fields
exist only in the space-time manifold with the one-dimensional arrow of time.
In the fermion sector the restrictions caused by the possibility to define the
multiplication on the densities of spinor fields can explain the chirality
violation. It is found that for bosons in the Higgs sector the charge
conjugation symmetry violation on the densities of states can be observed. This
symmetry violation can explain the matter-antimatter imbalance.

contributions of the two orbits (pair of consisting of the parent and newborn

simple bifurcation scenario of Hamiltonian systems with continuous symmetries,
where the contributions of the bifurcating parent orbits vanish upon
approaching the bifurcation point due to the reduction of the end-point
manifold. This occurs since the contribution of the parent orbits is included

symmetric bilinear vector bundle homomorphism of $E\times E$ in the trivial
bundle line bundle. We address the question whether a given gauge structure in
$E$ is metric. That is the main concerns. We use generalized Amari functors of
the information geometry for introducing two index functions defined in the
moduli space of gauge structures in $E$. Beside we introduce a differential
equation whose analysis allows to link the new index functions just mentioned
with the main concerns. We sketch applications in the differential geometry
theory of statistics. Reader interested in a former forum on the question
whether a giving connection is metric are referred to appendix.

the phase space of the constant-roll teleparallel gravity and we discuss the
physical significance of the resulting fixed points and trajectories. Also we
calculate the observational indices of a theory with given $f(T)$ gravity, and
we discuss all the implications of the constant-roll condition on these. As we

words in a text is investigated by deleting letters. By coding the words with
fewer letters the number of meanings per coded word increases. This increase is
measured and used as an input in a predictive theory. For a text written in
English, the word-frequency distribution is broad and fat-tailed, whereas if
the words are only represented by their first letter the distribution becomes
exponential. Both distribution are well predicted by the theory, as is the
whole sequence obtained by consecutively representing the words by the first
L=6,5,4,3,2,1 letters. Comparisons of texts written by Chinese characters and
the same texts written by letter-codes are made and the similarity of the
corresponding frequency-distributions are interpreted as a consequence of the
multiple meanings of Chinese characters. This further implies that the
difference of the shape for word-frequencies for an English text written by
letters and a Chinese text written by Chinese characters is due to the coding
and not to the language per se.

promotes a rather shallow learning architecture which makes the training
faster. We conducted a comparative study to examine the capabilities of
autoencoders for different inputs such as raw images, Histogram of Oriented

on IRMA dataset containing $14,410$ x-ray images distributed across $57$
different classes. Experiments show an IRMA error of $313$ (equivalent to
$\approx 82\%$ accuracy) outperforming state-of-the-art works on retrieval from

  -- Dec 1, 2017",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many automatic skin lesion diagnosis systems use segmentation as a
preprocessing step to diagnose skin conditions because skin lesion shape,
border irregularity, and size can influence the likelihood of malignancy. This
paper presents, examines and compares two different approaches to skin lesion
segmentation. The first approach uses U-Nets and introduces a histogram
equalization based preprocessing step. The second approach is a C-Means
clustering based approach that is much simpler to implement and faster to
execute. The Jaccard Index between the algorithm output and hand segmented
images by dermatologists is used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. While
many recently proposed deep neural networks to segment skin lesions require a
significant amount of computational power for training (i.e., computer with
GPUs), the main objective of this paper is to present methods that can be used
with only a CPU. This severely limits, for example, the number of training
instances that can be presented to the U-Net. Comparing the two proposed
algorithms, U-Nets achieved a significantly higher Jaccard Index compared to
the clustering approach. Moreover, using the histogram equalization for
preprocessing step significantly improved the U-Net segmentation results.

the potential of using local binary patterns (LBP), deep features and the
bag-of-visual words (BoVW) scheme for the classification of histopathological
images. We introduce a new dataset, \emph{KIMIA Path960}, that contains 960
histopathology images belonging to 20 different classes (different tissue
types). We make this dataset publicly available. The small size of the dataset
and its inter- and intra-class variability makes it ideal for initial
investigations when comparing image descriptors for search and classification
in complex medical imaging cases like histopathology. We investigate deep
features, LBP histograms and BoVW to classify the images via leave-one-out
validation. The accuracy of image classification obtained using LBP was 90.62\%
while the highest accuracy using deep features reached 94.72\%. The dictionary
approach (BoVW) achieved 96.50\%. Deep solutions may be able to deliver higher
accuracies but they need extensive training with a large number of (balanced)
image datasets.

proportional to $nmk$, respectively. The principle of conservation of the Hopf
