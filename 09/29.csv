  Transitions",,,,,"math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel binary convex reformulation of the sparse regression
problem that constitutes a new duality perspective. We devise a new cutting
plane method and provide evidence that it can solve to provable optimality the
sparse regression problem for sample sizes n and number of regressors p in the
100,000s, that is two orders of magnitude better than the current state of the
art, in seconds. The ability to solve the problem for very high dimensions
allows us to observe new phase transition phenomena. Contrary to traditional
complexity theory which suggests that the difficulty of a problem increases
with problem size, the sparse regression problem has the property that as the
number of samples $n$ increases the problem becomes easier in that the solution
recovers 100% of the true signal, and our approach solves the problem extremely
fast (in fact faster than Lasso), while for small number of samples n, our
approach takes a larger amount of time to solve the problem, but importantly
the optimal solution provides a statistically more relevant regressor. We argue
that our exact sparse regression approach presents a superior alternative over
heuristic methods available at present.

regression. Our regressor is that degree $r$ polynomial which depends on at
most $k$ inputs, counting at most $\ell$ monomial terms, which minimizes the
sum of the squares of its prediction errors. The previous hierarchical sparse
specification aligns well with modern big data settings where many inputs are
not relevant for prediction purposes and the functional complexity of the
regressor needs to be controlled as to avoid overfitting. We present a two-step
approach to this hierarchical sparse regression problem. First, we discard
irrelevant inputs using an extremely fast input ranking heuristic. Secondly, we
take advantage of modern cutting plane methods for integer optimization to
solve our resulting reduced hierarchical $(k, \ell)$-sparse problem exactly.
The ability of our method to identify all $k$ relevant inputs and all $\ell$
monomial terms is shown empirically to experience a phase transition.
Crucially, the same transition also presents itself in our ability to reject
all irrelevant features and monomials as well. In the regime where our method
is statistically powerful, its computational complexity is interestingly on par
with Lasso based heuristics. The presented work fills a void in terms of a lack
of powerful disciplined nonlinear sparse regression methods in high-dimensional
settings. Our method is shown empirically to scale to regression problems with
$n\approx 10,000$ observations for input dimension $p\approx 1,000$.

associated coronal mass ejection near AR 12342 using SDO and LASCO/SOHO
observations. The prominence is seen with an embedded flux thread (FT) at one
end and bifurcates from the middle to a different footpoint location. The
morphological evolution of the FT is similar to an unstable flux rope (FR),
which we regard as prominence embedded FR. The FR twist exceeds the critical
value. In addition, the morphology of the prominence plasma in 304\AA~images
marks the helical nature of the magnetic skeleton with a total of 2.96 turns
along arc length. The potential field extrapolation model indicates that the
critical height of the background magnetic field gradient falls within the
inner corona (105Mm) consistent with the extent of coronal plasma loops. These
results suggest that the helical kink instability in the embedded FR caused the
slow rise of the prominence to a height of the torus instability domain.
Moreover, the differential emission measure analysis unveils heating of the
prominence plasma to coronal temperatures during eruption, suggesting a
reconnection-related heating underneath the upward rising embedded FR. The
prominence starts with a slow rise motion of 10km/s, followed by fast and slow
acceleration phases having an average acceleration of $28.9m/s^2$, $2.4m/s^2$
in C2, C3 field of view respectively. As predicted by previous numerical
simulations, the observed synchronous kinematic profiles of the CME leading
edge and the core supports the involved FR instability in the prominence

of separating the codewords sent by each transmitter, and decoding them
individually, forces integer-valued linear combinations at each receive

obtained by inverting the integer-valued matrix. While demonstrating superior
performance, IF requires complex optimization in order to find the optimal
linear combinations, and demands either using multi-level nested lattice codes,

the distribution of the resulting effective SNR is hard to evaluate.
  In this paper, we first give simple upper and lower bounds on the effective
SNR of a single linear combination in IF. These expressions allow us to easily
bound the distribution of the effective SNR for any given linear combination

sub-optimal, significantly reduce the complexity of the optimization process,

of dependence among agents. A widely-used estimator is the Graphical Lasso
(GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using
the $L_{1,1}$ matrix norm on the precision matrix $\Omega$. The $L_{1,1}$ norm
is a lasso penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in
$\Omega$. We propose a new estimator called Structured Graphical Lasso
(SGLASSO) that uses the $L_{1,2}$ mixed norm. The use of the $L_{1,2}$ penalty
controls for the structure of the sparsity in $\Omega$. We show that when the
network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible
GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes.
Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of
estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the
structure of the graphical model. In an empirical illustration using a classic
firms' investment dataset, we obtain a network of firms' dependence that
exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric

statistical strength among plates and providing more robust estimates of
compound activity. It can flexibly accommodate arbitrary distributions of
compound activities and is applicable to any plate geometry. The algorithm
provides a principled statistical approach for hit identification and false

identification sensitivity and specificity over the B-score method, which is
highly sensitive to threshold choice. The framework is implemented as an

reactor have recently received increased scrutiny due to observed differences
in predicted and measured inverse beta decay (IBD) yields, referred to as the
'reactor antineutrino flux anomaly.' In this paper, global fits are applied to
existing IBD yield measurements to produce constraints on antineutrino
production by individual plutonium and uranium fission isotopes. We find that
fits including measurements from highly 235U-enriched cores and fits including
Daya Bay's new fuel evolution result produce discrepant best-fit IBD yields for
235U and 239Pu. This discrepancy can be alleviated in a global analysis of all
datasets through simultaneous fitting of 239Pu, 235U, and 238U yields. The
measured IBD yield of U238 in this analysis is (7.02 +/- 1.65) x 10^-43
cm2/fission, nearly two standard deviations below existing predictions. Future
hypothetical IBD yield measurements by short-baseline reactor experiments are
examined to determine their possible impact on global understanding of isotopic
IBD yields. It is found that future improved short-baseline IBD yield
measurements at both high-enriched and low-enriched cores can significantly
improve constraints for 235U, 238U, and 239Pu, providing comparable or superior
precision to existing conversion- and summation-based antineutrino flux
predictions. Systematic and experimental requirements for these future

  In the paper, we are mainly interested in classes defined by logical

natural construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this

for suitable logically defined classes, separation for the logic enriched with

where the solutions are required to satisfy certain additional constraints
[SICOMP 10, 1981]. One of these, called Isomorphism With Restrictions, is to
decide for two given graphs $X_1=(V,E_1)$ and $X_2=(V,E_2)$ and a subset
$R\subseteq V\times V$ of forbidden pairs whether there is an isomorphism $\pi$
from $X_1$ to $X_2$ such that $\pi(i)\neq j$ for all $(i,j)\in R$. We prove
that this problem and several of its generalizations are in fact in FPT:
  - The problem of deciding whether there is an isomorphism between two graphs
that moves k vertices and satisfies Lubiw-style constraints is in FPT, with k
and the size of $R$ as parameters. The problem remains in FPT if a CNF of such
constraints is allowed. It follows that the problem to decide whether there is
an isomorphism that moves exactly k vertices is in FPT. This solves a question
left open in our article on exact weight automorphisms [STACS 2017].
  - When the weight and complexity are unrestricted, finding isomorphisms that
satisfy a CNF of Lubiw-style constraints can be solved in FPT with access to a
GI oracle.
  - Checking if there is an isomorphism $\pi$ between two graphs with
complexity t is also in FPT with t as parameter, where the complexity of a
permutation is the Cayley measure defined as the minimum number t such that
$\pi$ can be expressed as a product of t transpositions.
  - We consider a more general problem in which the vertex set of a graph X is
partitioned into Red and Blue, and we are interested in an automorphism that
stabilizes Red and Blue and moves exactly k vertices in Blue, where k is the
parameter. This problem was introduced by [Downey and Fellows 1999], and we
showed [STACS 2017] that it is W[1]-hard even with color classes of size 4
inside Red. Now, for color classes of size at most 3 inside Red, we show the
problem is in FPT.

which traders predict the value of arbitrary statistics of the random
variables, provided these statistics can be elicited by a scoring rule.
Surprisingly, despite active recent work on prediction markets, there has not
yet been any investigation into the properties of more general SRMs. To
initiate such a study, we ask the following question: in what sense are SRMs
""markets""? We classify SRMs according to several axioms that capture
potentially desirable qualities of a market, such as the ability to freely
exchange goods (contracts) for money. Not all SRMs satisfy our axioms: once a
contract is purchased in any market for prediction the median of some variable,
there will not necessarily be any way to sell that contract back, even in a
very weak sense. Our main result is a characterization showing that slight
generalizations of cost-function-based markets are the only markets to satisfy
all of our axioms for finite-outcome random variables. Nonetheless, we find
that several SRMs satisfy weaker versions of our axioms, including a novel
share-based market mechanism for ratios of expected values.

and superconductivity was developed. This theory adresses a formidable strong
coupling quantum manybody problem, in modern times. It is built on certain key
experimental facts: i) survival of a dynamical Mott localization in a metallic
state, ii) proliferation of bond singlets and iii) absence of fermi liquid
quasi particles. After summarising RVB theory I will provide an aerial view of,
mostly, new superconductors where I believe that, to a large degree RVB

handle outside stimuli and interact with the hardware, but reasoning about

do not precisely capture the complete execution semantics of interrupts such as
nested invocations of interrupt handlers. To overcome these limitations, we
propose an abstract interpretation framework for static verification of
interrupt-driven software that first analyzes each interrupt handler in
isolation as if it were a sequential program, and then propagates the result to
other interrupt handlers. This iterative process continues until results from
all interrupt handlers reach a fixed point. Since our method never constructs
the global model, it avoids the up-front blowup in model construction that
hampers existing, non-modular, verification techniques. We have evaluated our
method on 35 interrupt-driven applications with a total of 22,541 lines of

exothermic crystallization can account for the observed distant activity, the
measured properties are consistent with activity driven by sublimating
supervolatile ices such as CO$_2$, CO, O$_2$ and N$_2$. Survival of

its paths without observing other robots' states and intents. While other
distributed multi-robot collision avoidance systems exist, they often require
extracting agent-level features to plan a local collision-free action, which
can be computationally prohibitive and not robust. More importantly, in
practice the performance of these methods are much lower than their centralized
counterparts.
  We present a decentralized sensor-level collision avoidance policy for
multi-robot systems, which directly maps raw sensor measurements to an agent's
steering commands in terms of movement velocity. As a first step toward
reducing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized methods, we
present a multi-scenario multi-stage training framework to find an optimal
policy which is trained over a large number of robots on rich, complex
environments simultaneously using a policy gradient based reinforcement
learning algorithm. We validate the learned sensor-level collision avoidance
policy in a variety of simulated scenarios with thorough performance
evaluations and show that the final learned policy is able to find time
efficient, collision-free paths for a large-scale robot system. We also
demonstrate that the learned policy can be well generalized to new scenarios
that do not appear in the entire training period, including navigating a
heterogeneous group of robots and a large-scale scenario with 100 robots.

emissions, and energy consumption have been shown for homogeneous roadway
segments. However, speed limit changes frequently throughout the transportation
network, due to either safety-related considerations (e.g., workzone
operations) or congestion management schemes (e.g., speed harmonization
systems). These abrupt changes in speed limit can result in shock- wave
formation and cause travel time unreliability. Therefore, designing a
platooning strategy for tracking a reference velocity profile is critical to
enabling end-to-end platooning. Accordingly, this study introduces a
generalized control model to track a desired velocity profile, while ensuring
safety in the platoon of autonomous vehicles. We define appropriate natural
error terms and the target curve in the state space of the control system,
which is the set of points where all error terms vanish and corresponds to the
case when all vehicles move with the desired velocities and in the minimum safe
distance between them. In this way, we change the tracking velocity profile
problem into a state- feedback stabilization problem with respect to the target
curve. Under certain mild assumptions on the Lipschitz constant of the speed
drop profile, we show that the stabilizing feedback can be obtained via
introducing a natural dynamics for the maximum of the error terms for each
vehicle. Moreover, we show that with this stabilizing feedback collisions will
not occur if the initial state of the system of vehicles is sufficiently close
to the target curve. We also show that the error terms remain bounded
throughout the time and space. Two scenarios were simulated, with and without
initial perturbations, and results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
control model in tracking the speed drop while ensuring safety and string
stability.

mass, redshift, visual morphology and inclination. The stellar masses are in
the range $9.4<\log(M/M_\odot)<11.5$, and most objects have redshifts $\leq

nuclei with $L([OIII]\lambda 5007)\geq 3.8\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (that we
call ""strong AGN""). The stellar population of the control sample galaxies
within the inner $1$-$3$ kpc is dominated by the old ($\sim$ $4$ - $13$ Gyr)
age component, with a small contribution of intermediate age ($\sim 640$-$940$
Myr) and young stars ($\leq 40$ Myr) to the total light at $5700\AA$. While the
weaker AGN show a similar age distribution to that of the control galaxies, the
strong AGN show an increased contribution of younger stars and a decreased
contribution of older stars. Examining the relationship between the AGN stellar
population properties and $L([OIII])$, we find that with increasing
$L([OIII])$, the AGN exhibit a decreasing contribution from the oldest ($>4$
Gyr) stellar population relative to control galaxies, but have an increasing
contribution from the younger components with ages $\sim 40$ Myr. We also find
a correlation of the mean age differences (AGN - control) with $L([OIII])$, in
the sense that more luminous AGN are younger than the control objects, while
the low-luminosity AGN seem to be older. These results support a connection
between the growth of the galaxy bulge via formation of new stars and the
growth of the Supermassive Black Hole via matter accretion in the AGN phase.

We perform analytical and numerical calculations when an electromagnetic wave
interacts with an oscillating external magnetic field. We find that in an ideal
cavity, when the external field frequency is around the electromagnetic wave
frequency, the normal and parallel components of the wave suffer parametric
resonance at different rates, producing a vacuum birefringence effect growing
in time. We also study the case where there is no cavity and the oscillating

with increasing task horizon or action dimensionality. This puts many
real-world tasks out of practical reach of RL methods. In this work, we use
demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to
perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as
stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an
order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple
to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a
small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not

energy scale $\Lambda$ and use the framework of the effective field theory to
describe physics below that scale. Performing numerical simulations with
different values of the scale $\Lambda$ we are able to extend our previous
analysis and determine its range of validity.
  We study domain walls interpolating between the physical electroweak vacuum
and the vacuum appearing at very high field strengths. These domain walls could
be formed from non-homogeneous configurations of the Higgs field produced by
quantum fluctuations during inflation or thermal fluctuations during reheating.
  Our numerical simulations show that evolution of Higgs domain walls is rather
insensitive to interactions beyond the Standard Model as long as masses of new
particles are grater than $10^{12}\ \textrm{GeV}$. For lower values of
$\Lambda$ the RG improved effective potential is strongly modified at field
strengths crucial to the evolution of domain walls. For instance its minima
become degenerate for $\Lambda$ around $10^{11}\ \textrm{GeV}$. We find that
even in the case when the minima of the potential are nearly degenerate Higgs
domain walls decayed shortly after their formation for generic initial
conditions. On the other hand, in simulations with specifically chosen initial
conditions Higgs domain walls can live longer and enter the scaling regime.
  We also determine the energy spectrum of gravitational waves produced by

samples of hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters. While such large numbers
will help reduce statistical uncertainties, the control of systematics in
cluster masses becomes ever more crucial. Here we examine the effects of an
important source of systematic uncertainty in galaxy-based cluster mass
estimation techniques: the presence of significant dynamical substructure.
Dynamical substructure manifests as dynamically distinct subgroups in
phase-space, indicating an 'unrelaxed' state. This issue affects around a
quarter of clusters in a generally selected sample. We employ a set of mock
clusters whose masses have been measured homogeneously with commonly-used
galaxy-based mass estimation techniques (kinematic, richness, caustic, radial
methods). We use these to study how the relation between observationally
estimated and true cluster mass depends on the presence of substructure, as
identified by various popular diagnostics. We find that the scatter for an
ensemble of clusters does not increase dramatically for clusters with dynamical
substructure. However, we find a systematic bias for all methods, such that
clusters with significant substructure have higher measured masses than their
relaxed counterparts. This bias depends on cluster mass: the most massive
clusters are largely unaffected by the presence of significant substructure,
but masses are significantly overestimated for lower mass clusters, by
$\sim10\%$ at $10^{14}$ and $\geq20\%$ for $\leq10^{13.5}$. The use of cluster

$z=5.74$, $5.52$, $4.95$, and $4.87$, with column densities ranging from
$N_{\rm{CIV}}=10^{13.8}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $10^{14.8}$ cm$^{-2}$. At $z=5.74$, we
detect an i-dropout Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidate with a projected impact
parameter of 42 physical kpc from the CIV absorber. This LAE candidate has a
Ly$\alpha$-based star formation rate (SFR$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$) of 2 $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ and a UV-based SFR of 4 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Although we cannot
completely rule out that this $i$-dropout emitter may be an [OII] interloper,
its measured properties are consistent with the CIV powering galaxy at
$z=5.74$. For CIV absorbers at $z=4.95$ and $z=4.87$, although we detect two
LAE candidates with impact parameters of 160 kpc and 200 kpc, such distances
are larger than that predicted from the simulations. Therefore we treat them as
non-detections. For the system at $z=5.52$, we do not detect LAE candidates,
placing a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of SFR$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}\approx 1.5\ M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. In summary, in these four cases, we only detect one plausible CIV
source at $z=5.74$. Combining the modest SFR of the one detection and the three
non-detections, our HST observations strongly support that smaller galaxies
(SFR$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}} \lesssim 2\ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are main sources of
intergalactic CIV absorbers, and such small galaxies play a major role in the
metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium at $z\gtrsim5$.

cluster of $N$ spins, with each spin coupled to every other spin. Clusters with
$N=2$ and $3$ have been extensively studied as building blocks of square and
triangular lattice antiferromagnets. In both cases, large-$S$ semiclassical
descriptions have been fruitfully constructed, providing insights into the
physics of macroscopic magnetic systems. Here, we develop a semiclassical
theory for the $N=4$ cluster. This problem has rich mathematical structure with
a ground state space that has non-trivial topology. We show that the ground
states are appropriately parametrized by a unit vector order parameter and a
rotation matrix. Remarkably, in the low energy description, the physics of the
cluster reduces to that of an emergent free spin-$S$ spin and a rigid rotor.
This successfully explains the spectrum of the quadrumer and its associated
degeneracies. However, this mapping does not hold in the vicinity of collinear
ground states due to a subtle effect that arises from the non-manifold nature
of the ground state space. We demonstrate this by an analysis of soft
fluctuations, showing that collinear states have a larger number of soft modes.
Nevertheless, as these singularities only occur on a subset of measure zero,
the mapping to a spin and a rotor provides a good description of the quadrumer.
We interpret thermodynamic properties of the quadrumer that are accessible in
molecular magnets, in terms of the rotor and spin degrees of freedom. Our study
paves the way for field theoretic descriptions of systems such as pyrochlore
magnets.

large-scale magnetic flux can build-up onto the black hole and within the disk
leading to a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Such a MAD state is unstable to
the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, which itself leads to vigorous
turbulence and the emergence of low-density highly-magnetized bubbles. This
instability was studied in a thin (ratio of half-height H to radius R, $H/R

dynamics of the disk than for thicker disks. We find that the low-density
bubbles created by the magnetic RT instability decrease the stress (leading to
angular momentum transport) in the disk rather than increasing magnetic
torques. Indeed, we find that the dominant component of the stress is due to
turbulent magnetic fields, despite the suppression of the axisymmetric MRI and
the dominant presence of large-scale magnetic fields. This suggests that the

Observation of multiple channels does not give additional benefit to the
attacker (only a constant scaling) though it gives insight on the number of
observations required to achieve the minimum constant factor. Our proposed
algorithms are optimal in the sense that their regret upper bounds match their
corresponding regret lower-bounds. We show consistency between simulation and
analytical results under various system parameters.

observations of HD 95086, a young early-type star that hosts a directly imaged

The system can be depicted as a broad ($\Delta R/R \sim$0.84), inclined
(30\arcdeg$\pm$3\arcdeg) ring with millimeter emission peaked at 200$\pm$6 au
from the star. The 1.3 mm disk emission is consistent with a broad disk with
sharp boundaries from 106$\pm$6 to 320$\pm$20 au with a surface density
distribution described by a power law with an index of --0.5$\pm$0.2. Our deep
ALMA map also reveals a bright source located near the edge of the ring, whose
brightness at 1.3 mm and potential spectral energy distribution are consistent
with it being a luminous star-forming galaxy at high redshift. We set

& Tan proposed Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF), an in situ formation theory,
to explain these planets. IOPF involves sequential planet formation from
pebble-rich rings that are fed from the outer disk and trapped at the pressure
maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB). Planet masses are
set by their ability to open a gap and cause the DZIB to retreat outwards. We
present models for the disk density and temperature structures that are
relevant to the conditions of IOPF. For a wide range of DZIB conditions, we
evaluate the gap opening masses of planets in these disks that are expected to
lead to truncation of pebble accretion onto the forming planet. We then
consider the evolution of dust and pebbles in the disk, estimating that pebbles
typically grow to sizes of a few cm during their radial drift from several tens
of AU to the inner, $\lesssim1\:$AU-scale disk. A large fraction of the
accretion flux of solids is expected to be in such pebbles. This allows us to
estimate the timescales for individual planet formation and entire planetary
system formation in the IOPF scenario. We find that to produce realistic STIPs
within reasonable timescales similar to disk lifetimes requires disk accretion
rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and relatively low viscosity
conditions in the DZIB region, i.e., Shakura-Sunyaev parameter of
$\alpha\sim10^{-4}$.

Cassini UVIS and CAPS indicate that haze formation initiates in the
thermosphere where there is a greater flux of EUV photons and energetic
particles available to initiate chemical reactions, including the destruction
of N2. The discovery of previously unpredicted nitrogen species in Titan's
atmosphere by Cassini INMS indicates that nitrogen participates in the
chemistry to a much greater extent than was appreciated before Cassini. The
degree of nitrogen in the haze is important for understanding the diversity of
molecules present in Titan's atmosphere and on its surface. We have conducted a
series of simulation experiments using either spark discharge or FUV photons to
initiate chemistry in CH4/N2 gas mixtures (0.01% CH4/99.99% N2 to 10% CH4/90%
N2). We obtained in situ real-time measurements using an HR-ToF-AMS to measure
the particle composition as a function of particle size and a PIT-MS to measure
the composition of gas phase products. These two techniques allow us to
investigate the effect of energy source and initial CH4 concentration on the
degree of nitrogen incorporation in both the gas and solid phase products. The
results presented here confirm that FUV photons produce not only solid phase
nitrogen bearing products but also gas phase nitrogen species. We find that in
both the gas and solid phase, nitrogen is found in nitriles rather than amines
and both the gas phase and solid phase products are composed primarily of
molecules with a low degree of aromaticity. The UV experiments reproduce the
absolute abundances measured in Titan's stratosphere for a number of gas phase

mixed-integer branching formulation framework. Our approach maintains favorable
algorithmic properties of traditional MIP formulations: in particular,
amenability to branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut algorithms. Our main
technical result gives an explicit linear inequality description for both
traditional MIP and mixed-integer branching formulations for a wide range of
disjunctive constraints. The formulations obtained from this description have
linear programming relaxations that are as strong as possible and generalize
some of the most computationally effective formulations for piecewise linear

strong mixed-integer branching formulation for any disjunctive constraint that
uses only two integer variables and a linear number of extra constraints. We
sharpen this result for univariate piecewise linear functions and annulus
constraints arising in power systems and robotics, producing strong
mixed-integer branching formulations that use only two integer variables and a
constant ($\leq 6$) number of general inequality constraints. Along the way, we
produce two strong logarithmic-sized traditional MIP formulations for the

a series of transient Ca$^{2+}$ changes on several temporal scales. Here we
analyze a set of Ca$^{2+}$ spike trains recorded in acute rodent pancreatic

information on the change point, and seek to optimally exercise the option by
maximising its discounted payoff under the physical measure. The first agent
has full information, and observes the change point. The second agent has
partial information and filters the change point from price observations. This

a model under the observation filtration $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$ in which the

$10^{-5}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ during the super-soft source phase - both
of which could be problematic for a number of well-established nova eruption

resources of the searcher). The objective is to cover all the edges of a tree
$T$ using the minimum number of routes, each starting and ending at the root
and each being of length at most $B$. To this end, we analyze the following
natural greedy tree traversal process that is based on decomposing a depth
first search traversal into a sequence of limited length routes. Given any
arbitrary depth first search traversal $R$ of the tree $T$, we cover $R$ with
routes $R_1,\ldots,R_l$, each of length at most $B$ such that: $R_i$ starts at
the root, reaches directly the farthest point of $R$ visited by $R_{i-1}$, then
$R_i$ continues along the path $R$ as far as possible, and finally $R_i$
returns to the root. We call the above algorithm \emph{piecemeal-DFS} and we
prove that it achieves the asymptotically minimal number of routes $l$,
regardless of the choice of $R$. Our analysis also shows that the total length
of the traversal (and thus the traversal time) of piecemeal-DFS is
asymptotically minimum over all energy-constrained exploration strategies. The
fact that $R$ can be chosen arbitrarily means that the exploration strategy can
be constructed in an online fashion when the input tree $T$ is not known in
advance. Surprisingly, our results show that depth first search is efficient
for energy constrained exploration of trees, even though it is known that the
same does not hold for energy constrained exploration of arbitrary graphs.

synchronous rotation, as observed in the case of Venus. They thus participate
to determine the possible climates and general circulations of the atmospheres
of these planets. In this work, we write the equations governing the dynamics
of thermal tides in a local vertically-stratified section of a rotating
planetary atmosphere by taking into account the effects of the complete
Coriolis acceleration on tidal waves. This allows us to derive analytically the
tidal torque and the tidally dissipated energy, which we use to discuss the
possible regimes of tidal dissipation and examine the key role played by
stratification.
  In agreement with early studies, we find that the frequency dependence of the
thermal atmospheric tidal torque in the vicinity of synchronization can be
approximated by a Maxwell model. This behaviour corresponds to weakly stably
stratified or convective fluid layers, as observed in ADLM2016a. A strong
stable stratification allows gravity waves to propagate, which makes the tidal
torque become negligible. The transition is continuous between these two
regimes. The traditional approximation appears to be valid in thin atmospheres
and in regimes where the rotation frequency is dominated by the forcing or the
buoyancy frequencies.
  Depending on the stability of their atmospheres with respect to convection,
observed exoplanets can be tidally driven toward synchronous or asynchronous
final rotation rates. The domain of applicability of the traditional
approximation is rigorously constrained by calculations.

around each galaxy in the survey into spherical harmonics and combining these
coefficients to form multipole moments. The $N^2$ scaling occurred because this
approach never explicitly required the relative angle between a galaxy pair
about the primary galaxy. Here we generalize this work, demonstrating that in
the presence of azimuthally-symmetric anisotropy produced by redshift-space
distortions (RSD) the 3PCF can be described by two triangle side lengths, two
independent total angular momenta, and a spin. This basis for the anisotropic
3PCF allows its computation with negligible additional work over the isotropic
3PCF. We also present the covariance matrix of the anisotropic 3PCF measured in
this basis. Our algorithm tracks the full 5-D redshift-space 3PCF, uses an
accurate line of sight to each triplet, is exact in angle, and easily handles
edge correction. It will enable use of the anisotropic large-scale 3PCF as a

a branch point where all sheets of the curve come together. The infinity serves
as the basepoint for Abel's map, and the basepoint in the definition of the
second kind integrals. We define second kind differentials as having a pole at
the infinity, therefore the second kind integrals need to be regularized. We
propose the regularization consistent with the structure of the field of
Abelian functions on Jacobian of the curve. In this connection we introduce the
notion of regularization constant, a uniquely defined free term in the
expansion of the second kind integral over a local parameter in the vicinity of
the infinity. This is a vector with components depending on parameters of the
curve, the number of components is equal to genus of the curve. Presence of the
term guarantees consistency of all relations between Abelian functions
constructed with the help of the second kind integrals. We propose two methods
of calculating the regularization constant, and obtain these constants for
$(3,4)$, $(3,5)$, $(3,7)$, and $(4,5)$-curves. By the example of $(3,4)$-curve,
we extend the proposed regularization to the case of second kind integrals with
the pole at an arbitrary fixed point. Finally, we propose a scheme of obtaining
addition formulas, where the second kind integrals, including the proper
regularization constants, are used.

  evolution","35 pages, Submitted to International Journal of Plasticity",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Plastic deformation in polycrystals is governed by the interplay between
intra-granular slip and grain boundary-mediated plasticity. However, while the
role played by bulk dislocations is relatively well-understood, the
contribution of grain boundaries (GBs) has only recently begun to be studied.
GB plasticity is known to play a key role along with bulk plasticity under a
wide range of conditions, such as dynamic recovery, superplasticity, severe
plastic deformation , etc., and developing models capable of simultaneously
capturing GB and bulk plasticity has become a topic of high relevance. In this
paper we develop a thermodynamically-consistent polycrystal plasticity model
capable of simulating a variety of grain boundary-mediated plastic processes in
conjunction with bulk dislocation slip. The model starts from the description
of a single crystal and creates lattice strain-free polycrystalline
configurations by using a specially-designed multiplicative decomposition
developed by the authors. This leads to the introduction of a particular class
of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) that define fundamental GB
features such as misorientation and inclination. The evolution of the system is
based on an energy functional that uses a non-standard function of the GND
tensor to account for the grain boundary energy, as well as for the standard
elastic energy. Our implementation builds on smooth descriptions of GBs
inspired on diffuse-interface models of grain evolution for numerical
convenience. We demonstrate the generality and potential of the methodology by
simulating a wide variety of phenomena such as shear-induced GB sliding,
coupled GB motion, curvature-induced grain rotation and shrinkage, and
polygonization via dislocation sub-grain formation.

meaningful information about a shape. We have first to separate the curves
belonging to features from those caused by noise and then to select the lines,
which describe non-trivial portions of a surface. The automatic detection of
such features is crucial for the identification and/or annotation of relevant
parts of a given shape. To do this, the Hough transform (HT) is a feature
extraction technique widely used in image analysis, computer vision and digital
image processing, while, for 3D shapes, the extraction of salient feature
curves is still an open problem.
  Thanks to algebraic geometry concepts, the HT technique has been recently
extended to include a vast class of algebraic curves, thus proving to be a
competitive tool for yielding an explicit representation of the diverse feature
lines equations. In the paper, for the first time we apply this novel extension
of the HT technique to the realm of 3D shapes in order to identify and localize
semantic features like patterns, decorations or anatomical details on 3D
objects (both complete and fragments), even in the case of features partially
damaged or incomplete. The method recognizes various features, possibly
compound, and it selects the most suitable feature profiles among families of

122502 (2017)]. The determination of the neutron skin has important
implications for nuclear physics and astrophysics. Although the use of
electroweak probes provides a largely model-independent determination of the
neutron skin, the experimental challenges are enormous. Thus, the possibility
that differences in the charge radii of mirror nuclei may be used as a
surrogate for the neutron skin is a welcome alternative. To test the validity
of this assumption we perform calculations based on a set of relativistic
energy density functionals that span a wide region of values of $L$. Our
results confirm that the difference in charge radii of various
neutron-deficient nickel isotopes and their corresponding mirror nuclei is
indeed strongly correlated to both the neutron-skin thickness and $L$.
Moreover, given that various neutron-star properties are also sensitive to $L$,
a data-to-data relation emerges between the difference in charge radii of
mirror nuclei and the radius of low-mass neutron stars.

the rate of change of complexity is a monotonically increasing function of
time, which saturates from below to a positive constant in the late time limit.
Using the CA conjecture for uncharged black holes, the holographic complexity
remains constant for an initial period, then briefly decreases but quickly
begins to increase. As observed previously, at late times, the rate of growth
of the complexity approaches a constant, which may be associated with Lloyd's
bound on the rate of computation. However, we find that this late time limit is
approached from above, thus violating the bound. Adding a charge to the eternal
black holes washes out the early time behaviour, i.e., complexity immediately
begins increasing with sufficient charge, but the late time behaviour is
essentially the same as in the neutral case. We also evaluate the complexity of
formation for charged black holes and find that it is divergent for extremal
black holes, implying that the states at finite chemical potential and zero
temperature are infinitely more complex than their finite temperature
counterparts.

the high optical depth, diffusion regime. Multiple acceleration schemes have
been developed to improve the efficiency of MCRT but the noise from photon
packet discretization remains a challenge. The discrete diffusion Monte Carlo
(DDMC) scheme has been successfully applied in state-of-the-art radiation
hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations. Still, the established framework is not
optimal for resonant line transfer. Inspired by the DDMC paradigm, we present a
novel extension to resonant DDMC (rDDMC) in which diffusion in space and
frequency are treated on equal footing. We explore the robustness of our new
method and demonstrate a level of performance that justifies incorporating the
method into existing Ly$\alpha$ codes. We present computational speedups of
$\sim 10^2$-$10^6$ relative to contemporary MCRT implementations with schemes
that skip scattering in the core of the line profile. This is because the rDDMC
runtime scales with the spatial and frequency resolution rather than the number
of scatterings - the latter is typically $\propto \tau_0$ for static media, or
$\propto (a \tau_0)^{2/3}$ with core-skipping. We anticipate new frontiers in
which on-the-fly Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer calculations are feasible in 3D
RHD. More generally, rDDMC is transferable to any computationally demanding
problem amenable to a Fokker-Planck approximation of frequency redistribution.

supervised domain adaptation and generalization with deep models. The main idea
is to exploit the Siamese architecture to learn an embedding subspace that is
discriminative, and where mapped visual domains are semantically aligned and
yet maximally separated. The supervised setting becomes attractive especially
when only few target data samples need to be labeled. In this scenario,
alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is difficult
because of the lack of data. We found that by reverting to point-wise
surrogates of distribution distances and similarities provides an effective
solution. In addition, the approach has a high speed of adaptation, which
requires an extremely low number of labeled target training samples, even one
per category can be effective. The approach is extended to domain
generalization. For both applications the experiments show very promising
results.

a predictor that treats the correlated-random-effects distribution as known

by generating consensus among multiple experts when they mark the same image.
Automatically building consensus contours to establish quality assurance for
image segmentation is presently absent in the clinical practice. As the
\emph{big data} becomes more and more available, techniques to access a large
number of existing segments of multiple experts becomes possible. Fast
algorithms are, hence, required to facilitate the search for similar cases. The
present work puts forward a potential framework that tested with small datasets
(both synthetic and real images) displays the reliability of finding similar
images. In this paper, the idea of content-based barcodes is used to retrieve
similar cases in order to build consensus contours in medical image
segmentation. This approach may be regarded as an extension of the conventional
atlas-based segmentation that generally works with rather small atlases due to
required computational expenses. The fast segment-retrieval process via
barcodes makes it possible to create and use large atlases, something that
directly contributes to the quality of the consensus building. Because the
accuracy of experts' contours must be measured, we first used 500 synthetic
prostate images with their gold markers and delineations by 20 simulated users.
The fast barcode-guided computed consensus delivered an average error of
$8\%\!\pm\!5\%$ compared against the gold standard segments. Furthermore, we
used magnetic resonance images of prostates from 15 patients delineated by 5
oncologists and selected the best delineations to serve as the gold-standard
segments. The proposed barcode atlas achieved a Jaccard overlap of
$87\%\!\pm\!9\%$ with the contours of the gold-standard segments.

color and tone that are caused by camera auto-adjustments like white-balance
and exposure. When such videos are sub-sampled to play fast-forward, as in the
increasingly popular forms of timelapse and hyperlapse videos, these temporal
variations are exacerbated and appear as visually disturbing high frequency
flickering. Previous techniques to photometrically stabilize videos typically
rely on computing dense correspondences between video frames, and use these
correspondences to remove all color changes in the video sequences. However,
this approach is limited in fast-forward videos that often have large content
changes and also might exhibit changes in scene illumination that should be
preserved. In this work, we propose a novel photometric stabilization algorithm
for fast-forward videos that is robust to large content-variation across
frames. We compute pairwise color and tone transformations between neighboring
frames and smooth these pair-wise transformations while taking in account the
possibility of scene/content variations. This allows us to eliminate
high-frequency fluctuations, while still adapting to real variations in scene
characteristics. We evaluate our technique on a new dataset consisting of
controlled synthetic and real videos, and demonstrate that our techniques
outperforms the state-of-the-art.

probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which
is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the
other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which
reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we
propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework
connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We
primarily considered a discrete case consisting of $n$ elements and studied the
geometry of the probability simplex $S_{n-1}$, which is the set of all
probability distributions over $n$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was
introduced in $S_{n-1}$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from
distribution ${\mathbf{p}}$ to distribution ${\mathbf{q}}$, where
${\mathbf{p}}$, ${\mathbf{q}} \in S_{n-1}$. We relaxed the optimal
transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal
solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The
entropy-relaxed optimal cost $C({\mathbf{p}}, {\mathbf{q}})$ was
computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but
does not define a distance because it is not minimized at
${\mathbf{p}}={\mathbf{q}}$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the
computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the
manifold $S_{n-1} \times S_{n-1}$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully
explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation
plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in
$S_{n-1}$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the
KL-divergence.

of the Riesz fractional derivative of the leading term in the truncated
Legendre-Lobatto expansion. It is observed that the convergence rate for
different $\alpha$ at the superconvergence points is at least $O(N^{-2})$
better than the optimal global convergence rate. Furthermore, the interpolation
is generalized to the Riesz derivative of order $\alpha > 1$ with the help of
GJF, which deal well with the singularities. The well-posedness, convergence
and superconvergence properties are theoretically analyzed. The gain of the
convergence rate at the superconvergence points is analyzed to be
$O(N^{-(\alpha+3)/2})$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $O(N^{-2})$ for $\alpha > 1$.

paper introduces a steering control law for a pair of agents operating in the
vicinity of a fixed beacon in a three-dimensional environment. This feedback
law is a modification of the previously studied three-dimensional constant
bearing (CB) pursuit law, in the sense that it incorporates an additional term
to allocate attention to the beacon. We investigate the behavior of the
closed-loop dynamics for a two agent mutual pursuit system in which each agent
employs the beacon-referenced CB pursuit law with regards to the other agent
and a stationary beacon. Under certain assumptions on the associated control
parameters, we demonstrate that this problem admits circling equilibria wherein
the agents move on circular orbits with a common radius, in planes
perpendicular to a common axis passing through the beacon. As the common radius
and distances from the beacon are determined by choice of parameters in the
feedback law, this approach provides a means to engineer desired formations in
a three-dimensional setting.

simple variant of the meshfree local radial-basis function (RBF) collocation

perform collocation on the domain boundaries. We can thereby take into account
the temperature profile as well as its gradients specified by boundary
conditions at the same time, which holds true even for a node where two or more
boundaries meet with different boundary conditions. We argue that the image
method is computationally efficient when combined with the local RBF
collocation method, whereas the addition of image nodes becomes very costly in
case of the global collocation. We apply our modified method to a benchmark
test of a boundary value problem, and find that this simple modification
reduces the maximum error from the analytic solution significantly. The
reduction is small for an initial value problem with simpler boundary
conditions. We observe increased numerical instability, which has to be
compensated for by a sufficient number of sample nodes and/or more careful
parameter choices for time integration.

which defection is a dominant strategy whereas cooperation is collectively
optimal. The iterated version of the dilemma has been extensively studied to
understand the emergence of cooperation. In the evolutionary context, the
iterated prisoner's dilemma is often combined with population dynamics, in
which a more successful strategy replicates itself with a higher growth rate.
Here, we investigate the replicator dynamics of three representative
strategies, i.e., unconditional cooperation, unconditional defection, and
tit-for-tat, which prescribes reciprocal cooperation by mimicking the
opponent's previous move. Our finding is that the dynamics is self-dual in the
sense that it remains invariant when we apply time reversal and exchange the
fractions of unconditional cooperators and defectors in the population. The
duality implies that the fractions can be equalized by tit-for-tat players,
although unconditional cooperation is still dominated by defection.
Furthermore, we find that mutation among the strategies breaks the exact
duality in such a way that cooperation is more favored than defection, as long
as the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is small.

of particles between neighboring lattice sites. In the case of diffusion in
inhomogeneous media, distinct spatial domains in the system may yield distinct
particle hopping rates. Starting from the master equations (MEs) governing
diffusion in inhomogeneous media we derive here, for arbitrary spatial
dimensions, the deterministic lattice equations (DLEs) specifying the average
particle number at each lattice site for randomly diffusing particles in
inhomogeneous media. We consider the case of free diffusion with no steric
constraints on the maximum particle number per lattice site as well as the case
of diffusion under steric constraints imposing a maximum particle
concentration. We find, for both transient and asymptotic regimes, excellent
agreement between the DLEs and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the MEs. The
DLEs provide a computationally efficient method for predicting the (average)
distribution of randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media, with the
number of DLEs associated with a given system being independent of the number
of particles in the system. From the DLEs we obtain general analytic
expressions for the steady-state particle distributions for free diffusion and,
in special cases, diffusion under steric constraints in inhomogeneous media. We
find that, in the steady state of the system, the average fraction of particles
in a given domain is independent of most system properties, such as the
arrangement and shape of domains, and only depends on the number of lattice
sites in each domain, the hopping rates, the number of distinct particle
species, and the total number of particles of each particle species in the
system. Our results provide general insights into the role of spatially
inhomogeneous particle hopping rates in setting the particle distributions in

improving the spectral efficiency of the next generation 5G wireless
communication networks. In this paper, the achievable average rate of an
Opportunistic Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (O-NOMA) based Cooperative
Relaying System (CRS) is studied under Rician fading channels with Channel
State Information (CSI) available at the source terminal. Based on CSI, for
opportunistic transmission, the source immediately chooses either the direct
transmission or the cooperative NOMA transmission using the relay, which can
provide better achievable average rate performance than the existing
Conventional-NOMA (C-NOMA) based CRS with no CSI at the source node.
Furthermore, a mathematical expression is also derived for the achievable
average rate and the results are compared with C-NOMA based CRS with no CSI at
the transmitter end, over a range of increasing power allocation coefficients,
transmit Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and average channel powers. Numerical
results show that the CRS using O-NOMA with CSI achieves better spectral
efficiency in terms of the achievable average rate than the Conventional-NOMA
based CRS without CSI. To check the consistency of the derived analytical
results, Monte Carlo simulations are performed which verify that the results
are consistent and matched well with the simulation results.

extends over 15 arc-minutes, corresponding to a linear size of approximately 36
pc. These two molecules are not just distributed in or near the hot cores. The
abundance of these two molecules seems to decrease from the cold outer region
to the central region associated with star-formation activity. Results present
here suggest that these two molecules are likely to form through a low
temperature process. Recent theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated
that prebiotic molecules can be efficiently formed in icy grain mantles through
several pathways. However, these complex ice features cannot be directly
observed, and most constraints on the ice compositions come from millimeter
observations of desorbed ice chemistry products. These results, combined with
laboratory studies, strongly support the existence of abundant prebiotic
molecules in ices.

our paper entitled ""A study of problems encountered in Granger causality
analysis from a neuroscience perspective."" (PNAS 114(34):7063-7072. 2017). In
our paper, we analyzed several properties of Granger-Geweke causality (GGC) and
discussed potential problems in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated: (i)
that GGC, estimated using separate model fits, is either severely biased,
particularly when the true model is known, or a high variance is introduced to
overcome the bias; and (ii) that GGC does not reflect some component dynamics
of the system. The commentaries by both Faes et al. and Barnett et al. point
out that the computational problems of (i) are resolved by using recent
computational methods. We acknowledge that these problems are indeed resolved
by these methods. However, the traditional computation using separate model
fits continues to be presented and applied. More fundamentally, the
interpretational problems stemming from (ii) are not in anyway addressed by the
improved methods because they are inherent to the definition of GGC. These
properties are indeed acknowledged by both commentaries. We have no
misconception of the GGC measure and do not claim that these properties are
facially wrong. But we do discuss at length how these properties make it
inappropriate and misleading for common types of scientific questions, how
presentation of GGC results without model estimates are not decipherable, and
how the absence of clear statements of questions of interest present further
opportunities for misinterpretation.

dS0, dE, dE$_{bc}$, dSph, dE$_{blue}$, and dI, of which the first four
sub-types are considered as early-type and the last two as late-type. The
environmental parameters we consider are the projected distance from the host
galaxy ($r_{p}$), local and global background densities, and the host
morphology. The spatial distributions of dwarf satellites of early-type
galaxies are much different from those of dwarf satellites of late-type
galaxies, suggesting the host morphology combined with $r_{p}$ plays a decisive
role on the morphology of the dwarf satellite galaxies. The local and global
background densities play no significant role on the morphology of dwarfs in
the satellite systems hosted by early-type galaxies. However, in the satellite
system hosted by late-type galaxies, the global background densities of dE and
dSph satellites are significantly different from those of dE$_{bc}$,
dE$_{blue}$, and dI satellites. The blue-cored dwarf satellites (dE$_{bc}$) of
early-type galaxies are likely to be located at $r_{p} > 0.3$ Mpc to keep their
cold gas from the ram pressure stripping by the hot corona of early-type
galaxies. The spatial distribution of dE$_{bc}$ satellites of early-type
galaxies and their global background densities suggest that their cold gas is
intergalactic material accreted before they fall into the satellite systems.

services that run on high-volume servers, switches, and storage hardware to
virtualize network functions. Virtualization techniques can be used in IP
multimedia subsystem (IMS) cloud computing to develop different networking
functions (e.g., load balancing and call admission control). IMS network
signaling happens through session initiation protocol (SIP). An open issue is
the control of overload that occurs when an SIP server lacks sufficient CPU and
memory resources to process all messages. This paper proposes a virtual load
balanced call admission controller (VLB-CAC) for the cloud-hosted SIP servers.
VLB-CAC determines the optimal call admission rates and signaling paths for
admitted calls along with the optimal allocation of CPU and memory resources of
the SIP servers. This optimal solution is derived through a new linear
programming model. This model requires some critical information of SIP servers
as input. Further, VLB-CAC is equipped with an autoscaler to overcome resource
limitations. The proposed scheme is implemented in smart applications on
virtual infrastructure (SAVI) which serves as a virtual testbed. An assessment
of the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of the

automorphic equation $f(\phi(z))=f(z)$, were $f(z)$ is entire. Tatsujir\^o
Shimizu also refers to the functions of this group as those functions that are
determined by $f^{-1}\circ f$. He proved many remarkable properties of those
automorphic functions. He indicated how they induce a beautiful geometric
structure on the complex plane. Those structures were termed by Tatsujir\^o
Shimizu, the system of normal polygonal domains, and the more refined system of
the fundamental domains of $f(z)$. The last system if exists tiles up the
complex plane with remarkable geometric tiles that are conformally mapped to
one another by the automorphic functions. In the Ph.D thesis of the author,
those tiles were also called the system of the maximal domains of $f(z)$. One
can not avoid noticing the many similarities between this automorphic group and
its accompanying geometric structures and analytic properties, and the more
tame discrete groups that appear in the theory of hyperbolic geometry and also
the arithmetic groups in number theory. This paper pursues further the theory

originally driven by the last CME to propagate through the preceding two CMEs

polarization measurements of the starlight surrounding the lines of sight of
the 355 quasars for which reliable optical polarization measurements are
available. In this paper, we take advantage of the full-sky and high quality
polarization data released by the \textit{Planck} satellite to provide an
independent, complementary, and up-to-date estimation of the contamination
level of the quasar optical polarization data by the Galactic dust. Our
analysis reveals signatures of Galactic dust contamination at the two sigma
level for about 30 per cent of the quasar optical polarization data sample. The
remaining 70 per cent of the lines of sight do not show Galactic dust
contamination above the two sigma level, suggesting low to negligible
contamination of the quasar optical polarization signal. We further found
arguments suggesting that Galactic thermal dust cannot fully account for the
reported quasar optical polarization alignments. Based on the measurements of
the ratio of the polarized intensity of the dust in the submillimeter to the
degree of linear polarization of the quasar in the optical, we provide a new
and independent quality criteria to apply to the quasar optical polarization
sample. We argue that, unless correction is applied, such a criterion should be
imposed on the data for future investigations in the framework of the
cosmological-scale correlations of quasar optical polarization vector
orientations that still could compete with the isotropic principle of the

introducing a slow driving of the dynamics to mimic the effect of slowly

manner broadly in line with empirical observations. Our model also allows to
identify collective, interaction mediated properties of pricing distributions

contain a ferro-magnetic bias. Using simulations, we are able to substantiate
one of the main hypotheses underlying the original modelling, viz. that the
phenomenon of volatility clustering can be rationalised in terms of an
interplay between the dynamics within meta-stable states and the dynamics of
occasional transitions between them.

  Economics",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facility location games have been a topic of major interest in economics,
operations research and computer science, starting from the seminal work by
Hotelling. Spatial facility location models have successfully predicted the
outcome of competition in a variety of scenarios. In a typical facility
location game, users/customers/voters are mapped to a metric space representing
their preferences, and each player picks a point (facility) in that space. In
most facility location games considered in the literature, users are assumed to
act deterministically: given the facilities chosen by the players, users are
attracted to their nearest facility. This paper introduces facility location
games with probabilistic attraction, dubbed Shapley facility location games,
due to a surprising connection to the Shapley value. The specific attraction
function we adopt in this model is aligned with the recent findings of the
behavioral economics literature on choice prediction. Given this model, our
first main result is that Shapley facility location games are potential games;
hence, they possess pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the latter is true for any
compact user space, any user distribution over that space, and any number of
players. Note that this is in sharp contrast to Hotelling facility location
games. In our second main result we show that under the assumption that players
can compute an approximate best response, approximate equilibrium profiles can
be learned efficiently by the players via dynamics. Our third main result is a
bound on the Price of Anarchy of this class of games, as well as showing the
bound is tight. Ultimately, we show that player payoffs coincide with their
Shapley value in a coalition game, where coalition gains are the social welfare
of the users.

variability using the hardness ratio techniques. We also investigated spectral
variability of different spectral components. The spectra were merged in six
epochs (defined as adjacent observations) and in high and low flux states to
understand whether the flux transitions are accompanied by spectral changes.
The flux variability is significant in all the sources investigated. The
hardness ratios in general are not as variable as the fluxes. Only one source
displays a variable HR, anti-correlated with the flux (source 337). The
spectral analysis in the available epochs confirms the steeper when brighter
trend consistent with Comptonisation models only in this source. Finding this
trend in one out of seven unabsorbed sources is consistent, within the
statistical limits, with the 15 % of unabsorbed AGN in previous deep surveys.
No significant variability in the column densities, nor in the Compton
reflection component, has been detected across the epochs considered. The high
and low states display in general different normalisations but consistent
spectral properties. X-ray flux fluctuations are ubiquitous in AGN. In general,
the significant flux variations are not associated with a spectral variability:
photon index and column densities are not significantly variable in nine out of
the ten AGN over long timescales (from 3 to 6.5 years). The photon index
variability is found only in one source (which is steeper when brighter) out of
seven unabsorbed AGN. These results are consistent with previous deep samples.

over time. They define edge capacities to be the total amount of flow that can
enter an edge {\em in one time unit}. Each edge also has a length, representing
the time needed to traverse it. Dynamic Flows have been used to model many
problems including traffic congestion, hop-routing of packets and evacuation
protocols in buildings. While the basic problem of moving the maximal amount of
supplies from sources to sinks is polynomial time solvable, natural minor
modifications can make it NP-hard.
  One such modification is that flows be confluent, i.e., all flows leaving a
vertex must leave along the same edge. This corresponds to natural conditions
in, e.g., evacuation planning and hop routing.
  We investigate the single-sink Confluent Quickest Flow problem. The input is
a graph with edge capacities and lengths, sources with supplies and a sink. The
problem is to find a confluent flow minimizing the time required to send
supplies to the sink. Our main results include: a) Logarithmic
Non-Approximability: Directed Confluent Quickest Flows cannot be approximated
in polynomial time with an $O(\log n)$ approximation factor, unless $P=NP$.
  b) Polylogarithmic Bicriteria Approximations: Polynomial time $(O(\log^8 n),
O(\log^2 \kappa))$ bicritera approximation algorithms for the Confluent
Quickest Flow problem where $\kappa$ is the number of sinks, in both directed
and undirected graphs.
  Corresponding results are also developed for the Confluent Maximum Flow over

  measurements with Belle II and LHCb",,,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A range of flavour physics observables show tensions with their corresponding
Standard Model expectations: measurements of leptonic flavour-changing neutral
current processes and ratios of semi-leptonic branching fractions involving
different generations of leptons show deviations of the order of four standard
deviations. If confirmed, either would be an intriguing sign of new physics. In
this manuscript, we analyse the current experimental situation of such
processes and for the first time estimate the combined impact of the future
datasets of the Belle II and LHCb experiments on the present tensions with the
Standard Model expectations by performing scans of the new physics contribution
to the Wilson coefficients. In addition, the present day and future sensitivity
of tree-level CKM parameters, which offer orthogonal tests of the Standard
Model, are explored. Three benchmark points in time are chosen for a direct
comparison of the estimated sensitivity between the experiments. A high
complementarity between the future sensitivity achieved by the Belle II and
LHCb experiments is observed due to their relative strengths and weaknesses. We
estimate that all of the anomalies considered here will be either confirmed or
ruled out by both experiments independently with very high significance by the
end of data-taking at Belle II and the LHCb upgrade.

photonic-crystal waveguides lead to the spontaneous formation of
Anderson-localized modes thereby limiting slowlight propagation and its
potential applications. On the other hand, disorder-induced cavities offer an
approach to cavity-quantum electrodynamics and random lasing at the nanoscale.
The key statistical parameter governing the disorder effects is the
localization length, which together with the waveguide length determines the
statistical transport of light through the waveguide. In a disordered
photonic-crystal waveguide, the localization length is highly dispersive, and
therefore, by controlling the underlying lattice parameters, it is possible to
tune the localization of the mode. In the present work, we study the
localization length in a disordered photonic-crystal waveguide using numerical
simulations. We demonstrate two different localization regimes in the
dispersion diagram where the localization length is linked to the density of
states and the photon effective mass, respectively. The two different
localization regimes are identified in experiments by recording the
photoluminescence from quantum dots embedded in photonic-crystal waveguides.

in dispersed media flow? We focus on slow flows, where contacts are
long-lasting and hence contact mechanics effects should be most visible. To
answer our question, we synthesize soft hydrogel particles with different
friction coefficients. By making the particles soft, we can drive them at
finite confining pressure at all driving rates. For particles with a low
friction coefficient, we obtain a rheology similar to that of an emulsion, yet
with an effective friction much larger than expected from their microscopic
contact mechanics. Increasing the friction coefficient of the particles, we
find a flow instability in the suspension. Particle level flow and fluctuations
are also greatly affected by the microscopic friction coefficient of the
suspended particles. The specific rheology of our ""granular emulsions"" provides
further evidence that a better understanding of microscopic particle
interactions is of broad relevance for dispersed media flows.

improving the routing effective and reducing the calculation complexity, we
introduce the multi-objective optimization into the topology control. During
the routing process, nodes calculate the optimal transmission power and relay
node degree according to the properties of Pareto optimal solution set, by
which the optimal solutions can be selected. Based on these innovations, the
energy consumption, the transmission delay, and the throughout have been
improved greatly compared with the traditional power control based

mechanism of dimensional transmutation. Under the assumption of the
cancellation of the vacuum energy, the dilaton develops a very small mass at
2-loop order. As a result, a flat direction is present in the classical
dilaton-Higgs potential at zero temperature while the quantum potential admits
two (almost) degenerate local minima with unbroken and broken eletroweak
symmetry. We found that the cosmological electroweak phase transition in this
model can only be triggered by a QCD chiral symmetry breaking phase transition
at low temperatures, $T\lesssim 132$ MeV. Furthermore, unlike the standard
case, the universe settles into the chiral symmetry breaking vacuum via a
first-order phase transition which gives rise to a stochastic gravitational
background with a peak frequency $\sim 10^{-8}$ Hz as well as triggers the
production of approximately solar mass primordial black holes. The observation
of these signatures of cosmological phase transitions together with the

systems. Here we report the discovery of three planets transiting K2-136 (EPIC
247589423), a late K dwarf in the Hyades (~800 Myr) cluster, and robust
detection limits for additional planets in the system. The planets were
identified from their K2 light curves, as part of our survey of young clusters
and star forming regions. The smallest planet has a radius comparable to Earth
(0.99 +/- 0.05 Earth radii), making it one of the few Earth-sized planets with
a known, young age. The two larger planets are likely a mini-Neptune and a
super-Earth, with radii of 2.91+/-0.11 and 1.45+/-0.10 Earth radii,
respectively. The predicted radial velocity signals from these planets are
between 0.4 and 2 m/s, achievable with modern precision RV spectrographs.
Because the target star is bright (V=11.2) and has relatively low-amplitude
stellar variability for a young star (2-6 mmag), EPIC 247589423 hosts the best
planets known in a young open cluster for precise radial velocity follow-up,
enabling a robust test of earlier claims that young planets are less dense than
their older counterparts.

strongly varying sizes. Media of potential interest often form notably smaller
groups. Such media groups differ so much from the remaining data that it may be
worthy to look at them in more detail. In contrast, media with popular content
appear in larger groups. Identifying groups of varying sizes is addressed by
clustering of imbalanced data. Clustering highly imbalanced media groups is
additionally challenged by the high dimensionality of the underlying features.
In this paper, we present the Imbalanced Clustering (IClust) algorithm designed
to reveal group structures in high-dimensional media data. IClust employs an
existing clustering method in order to find an initial set of a large number of
potentially highly pure clusters which are then successively merged. The main
advantage of IClust is that the number of clusters does not have to be
pre-specified and that no specific assumptions about the cluster or data
characteristics need to be made. Experiments on real-world media data
demonstrate that in comparison to existing methods, IClust is able to better
identify media groups, especially groups of small sizes.

derived by extending Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach to fermionic
open systems involving pairing excitations. We obtain the exact master

the master equation for Majorana zero modes. Within this exact master equation

zero-energy bogolibons as well as the Majorana zero modes under local
perturbations. We find that at zero temperature, there is a zero-energy
localized bound state which is not the original zero-energy bogoliubon or the
original Majorana zero mode but a localized bound state of Majorana zero mode
after the charge fluctuation is taken into account. It is this zero-energy
localized bound state that protects Majorana zero modes from decoherence, as a
long-time non-Markovain memory effect. However, for the environment at finite

Majorana zero modes are locally perturbed, and decoherence is inevitable.

slip, ranging from devastating earthquakes to Slow Slip Events and persistent
creep. Understanding the mechanisms controlling the occurrence of rapid,
dynamic slip radiating seismic waves (i.e. earthquakes) or slow, silent slip
(i.e. SSEs) is a fundamental point in the estimation of seismic hazard along
subduction zones. On top of showing slower rupture propagation velocity than
earthquakes, SSEs exhibit different scaling relationships, which could reflect
either different physical mechanisms or an intriguing lack of observations.
Like earthquakes, SSEs are bound to occur along unstable portions of active
faults, raising the question of the physical control of the mode of slip
(seismic or aseismic) along these sections. Here, we use the numerical
implementation of a simple rate-weakening fault model to explain the
spontaneous occurrence, the characteristics and the scaling relationship of
SSEs and earthquakes. We show that the simplest of fault geometrical
complexities with uniform friction properties can reproduce slow and fast
earthquakes without appealing to complex rheologies or mechanisms. Our model
helps resolve many of the existing paradoxes between observations and physical
models of earthquakes and SSEs.

that the unitarity violating effects previously found disappear. A quantum loop

canonical for matter) also refers to the BO method. It does not involve the

$PGL_2(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$ of arithmetic conductor $C$ and archimedean
parameter $T$, and let $\phi$ be an $L^2$-normalized automorphic form in the
space of $\pi$. The sup-norm problem asks for bounds on $\| \phi \|_\infty$ in
terms of $C$ and $T$. The quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) problem concerns the
limiting behavior of the $L^2$-mass $|\phi|^2 (g) \, d g$ of $\phi$. All
previous work on these problems in the conductor-aspect has focused on the case
that $\phi$ is a newform.
  In this work, we study these problems for a class of automorphic forms that
are not newforms. Precisely, we assume that for each prime divisor $p$ of $C$,
the local component $\pi_p$ is supercuspidal (and satisfies some additional
technical hypotheses), and consider automorphic forms $\phi$ for which the
local components $\phi_p \in \pi_p$ are ""minimal"" vectors. Such vectors may be
understood as non-archimedean analogues of lowest weight vectors in holomorphic
discrete series representations of $PGL_2(\mathbb{R})$.
  For automorphic forms as above, we prove a sup-norm bound that is sharper
than what is known in the newform case. In particular, if $\pi_\infty$ is a
holomorphic discrete series of lowest weight $k$, we obtain the optimal bound
$C^{1/8 -\epsilon} k^{1/4 - \epsilon} \ll_{\epsilon} |\phi|_\infty
\ll_{\epsilon} C^{1/8 + \epsilon} k^{1/4+\epsilon}$. We prove also that these
forms give analytic test vectors for the QUE period, thereby demonstrating the
equivalence between the strong QUE and the subconvexity problems for this class
of vectors. This finding contrasts the known failure of this equivalence for
newforms of powerful level.

switching which depends strongly on the damping in the magnetisation dynamics.
It was recently measured that damping depends on the magnetic texture and,
consequently, is a non-local quantity. The damping enters the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation as the phenomenological Gilbert damping
parameter $\alpha$, that does not, in a straight forward formulation, account
for non-locality. Efforts were spent recently to obtain Gilbert damping from
first principles for magnons of wave vector $\mathbf{q}$. However, to the best
of our knowledge, there is no report about real space non-local Gilbert damping
$\alpha_{ij}$. Here, a torque-torque correlation model based on a tight binding
approach is applied to the bulk elemental itinerant magnets and it predicts
significant off-site Gilbert damping contributions, that could be also
negative. Supported by atomistic magnetisation dynamics simulations we reveal
the importance of the non-local Gilbert damping in atomistic magnetisation
dynamics. This study gives a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the
magnetic moments and dissipation processes in real magnetic materials. Ways of
manipulating non-local damping are explored, either by temperature, material's
doping or strain.

describes the susceptibility near criticality. These are found to be $\delta=2$

substantial reservoir of neutral hydrogen (HI) are likely to be isolated,
helping to disentangle intrinsic properties from evolutionary effects, and HI

MeerKAT's exquisite sensitivity, it can potentially contribute to these studies
of low-mass HI-rich dwarf galaxies that will help resolve the small scale

will still manage to detect a sample of galaxies with HI masses below 10^7 Msun

resolve ~15 systems with masses below 10^8.5 Msun, a critical regime for

extension of the recently proposed, unified form of radiation to the ACV
reduced-action model and to its resummed-eikonal exchange. By superimposing
that radiation all-over eikonal scattering, we are able to derive the
corresponding (unitary) coherent-state operator. The resulting graviton
spectrum, tuned on the gravitational radius $R$, fully agrees with previous
calculations for small angles $\Theta_s\ll 1$ but, for sizeable angles
$\Theta_s(b)\leq \Theta_c = O(1)$ acquires an exponential cutoff of the large
$\omega R$ region, due to energy conservation, so as to emit a finite fraction
of the total energy. In the approach-to-collapse regime of $b\to b_c^+$ we find
a radiation enhancement due to large tidal forces, so that the whole energy is
radiated off, with a large multiplicity $\langle N \rangle\sim Gs \gg 1$ and a
well-defined frequency cutoff of order $R^{-1}$.

simulations predict that the `missing baryons' are spread throughout
filamentary structures in the cosmic web, forming a low-density gas with
temperatures of $10^5-10^7\,\!$K. We search for this warm-hot intergalactic
medium (WHIM) by stacking the Planck Compton $y$-parameter map of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect for 1,002,334 pairs of CMASS galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We model the contribution from the galaxy halo pairs
assuming spherical symmetry, finding a residual tSZ signal at the
$2.9\mbox{$\sigma$}$ level from a stacked filament of length $10.5\,h^{-1}\,\rm
Mpc$ with a Compton parameter magnitude $y=(0.6\pm0.2)\times10^{-8}$. We
consider possible sources of contamination and conclude that bound gas in
haloes may contribute only up to $20\%$ of the measured filamentary signal. To
estimate the filament gas properties we measure the gravitational lensing
signal for the same sample of galaxy pairs; in combination with the tSZ signal,
this yields an inferred gas density of $\rho_{\rm b}=(5.5\pm
2.9)\times\bar{\rho_{\rm b}}$ with a temperature $T=(2.7\pm 1.7) \times
10^6\,$K. This result is consistent with the predicted WHIM properties, and
overall the filamentary gas can account for $ 11\pm 7\%$ of the total baryon
content of the Universe. We also see evidence that the gas filament extends
beyond the galaxy pair. Averaging over this longer baseline boosts the
significance of the tSZ signal and increases the associated baryon content to
$28\pm 12\%$ of the global value.

field decay scenario where a large magnetic field of a neutron star reaches
$\lesssim$ few$\times 10^{13}$G at ages $\gtrsim 1$ Myr. Among other sources,
the high mass X-ray binary 4U0114+65 seems to have a strong magnetic field
around $10^{14}$ G. We develop a new Bayesian estimate for the kinematic age
and demonstrate that 4U0114+65 has kinematic age 2.4-5 Myr ($95\%$ credential
interval) since the formation of the neutron star. We discuss which conditions
are necessary to explain the potential existence of magnetars in accreting
high-mass binaries with ages about few Myrs and larger. Three necessary
ingredients are: the Hall attractor to prevent rapid decay of dipolar field,
relatively rapid cooling of the crust in order to avoid Ohmic decay due to
phonons, and finally, low values of the parameter $Q$ to obtain long Ohmic time
scale due to impurities. If age and magnetic field estimates for proposed
accreting magnetars are correct, then these systems set the strongest limit on
the crust impurity for a selected sample of neutron stars and provide evidence
in favour of the Hall attractor.

beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In particular results of supersymmetry (SUSY)
searches are typically interpreted in the context of simplified models. While
mass limits obtained in this manner are highly model dependent, cross section
upper limits (or efficiency maps) may be used to obtain constraints on generic
BSM scenarios without any further event and detector simulation. This procedure
has been automatised in the public tool SModelS, which first decomposes the
generic scenario into its simplified model components which can then be tested
directly against the experimental constraints in the SModelS database. We
briefly introduce SModelS and then discuss how the coverage by simplified model
results compares to what can be obtained in a full simulation study for the
example of the 19 parameter phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM). Considering all
parameter points that ATLAS has tested in a comprehensive study [1], we find
that about 60 % of the points excluded by ATLAS can be excluded from simplified
model constraints. This fraction could be improved by considering currently
`missing' simplified model topologies. We show that in particular topologies
with asymmetric branches are often important, while long cascade decays with
more than one intermediate particle are less relevant. A particularly
interesting asymmetric branch topology is a 3 jet + $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$
signature arising from gluino-squark production.

energy and DE radiography depends on beam energy, beam filtration, radiation
dose, object size, and object content. The purpose of this work was to perform
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative investigations of the image quality
in MV radiography depending on the above parameters. A digital phantom was
designed including Fe background with thicknesses of 2cm, 6cm, and 18cm, and
materials samples of Polyethylene, Fe, Pb, and U. The single energy images were
generated at x-ray beam energies 3.5MV, 6MV, and 9MV. The DE material
decomposed images were generated using interlaced low and high energy beams
3.5/6MV and 6/9MV. The x-rays beams were filtered by low-Z (Polyethylene) and
high-Z (Pb) filters with variable thicknesses. The radiation output of the
accelerator was kept constant for all beam energies. The image quality metrics
was signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the particular sample over a particular
background. It was found that the SNR depends on the above parameters in a
complex way, but can be optimized by selecting a particular set of parameters.
For some imaging setups increased filter thicknesses, while strongly absorbed
the beams, increased the SNR of material decomposed images. Beam hardening due
to polyenergetic x-ray spectra resulted in material decomposition errors, but
this could be addressed using region of interest decomposition. It was shown
that it is not feasible to separate the materials with close atomic numbers

the distribution has a universal form --- it is binomial over the allowed range

establishing that the local nodal surpluses of disjoint cycles behave like

limit theorem for local statistics via quasi-associativity. In this work, we
prove general central limit theorems for local statistics and exponentially
quasi-local statistics of spin models on discrete Cayley graphs with polynomial
growth. Further, we supplement these results by proving similar central limit
theorems for random fields on discrete Cayley graphs and taking values in a
countable space but under the stronger assumptions of {\alpha}-mixing (for
local statistics) and exponential {\alpha}-mixing (for exponentially
quasi-local statistics). All our central limit theorems assume a suitable
variance lower bound like many others in the literature. We illustrate our
general central limit theorem with specific examples of lattice spin models and

networks. Examples of clustering spin models include quasi-associated spin
models with fast decaying covariances like the off-critical Ising model, level
sets of Gaussian random fields with fast decaying covariances like the massive
Gaussian free field and determinantal point processes with fast decaying

were detected in the X-ray, strongly indicating the presence of highly obscured

better accuracy than pre-ALMA estimates and to model the emission of the

emission feature which is most prominent in the region of $1-10$ GeV, known as
the Galactic Center GeV excess (GCE). Although the GCE is now firmly detected,
an interpretation of this emission as a signal of self-annihilating dark matter
(DM) particles is not unambiguously possible due to systematic effects in the
gamma-ray modeling estimated in the Galactic Plane. In this paper we build a
covariance matrix, collecting different systematic uncertainties investigated
in the Fermi Collaboration's paper that affect the GCE spectrum. We show that
models where part of the GCE is due to annihilating DM can still be consistent
with the new data. We also re-evaluate the parameter space regions of the
minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) that can contribute dominantly to
the GCE via neutralino DM annihilation. All recent constraints from DM direct
detection experiments such as PICO, LUX, PandaX and Xenon1T, limits on the
annihilation cross section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and Large Hadron
Collider limits are considered in this analysis. Due to a slight shift in the
energy spectrum of the GC excess with respect to the previous Fermi analysis,
and the recent limits from direct detection experiments, we find a slightly
shifted parameter region of the MSSM compared to our previous analysis that is
consistent with the GCE. Neutralinos with a mass between $85-220$ GeV can
describe the excess via annihilation into a pair of $W$-bosons or top quarks.
Remarkably, there are low fine-tuning models among the regions that we have
found. The complete set of solutions will be probed by upcoming direct
detection experiments and with dedicated searches in the upcoming data of the

epochs of training on the re-shuffled (either locally or globally) data. The
above procedure makes the instances used to compute the gradients no longer
independently sampled from the training data set. Then does the distributed SGD
method have desirable convergence properties in this practical situation? In
this paper, we give answers to this question. First, we give a mathematical
formulation for the practical data processing procedure in distributed machine
learning, which we call data partition with global/local shuffling. We observe
that global shuffling is equivalent to without-replacement sampling if the
shuffling operations are independent. We prove that SGD with global shuffling
has convergence guarantee in both convex and non-convex cases. An interesting
finding is that, the non-convex tasks like deep learning are more suitable to
apply shuffling comparing to the convex tasks. Second, we conduct the
convergence analysis for SGD with local shuffling. The convergence rate for
local shuffling is slower than that for global shuffling, since it will lose
some information if there's no communication between partitioned data. Finally,
we consider the situation when the permutation after shuffling is not uniformly
distributed (insufficient shuffling), and discuss the condition under which
this insufficiency will not influence the convergence rate. Our theoretical
results provide important insights to large-scale machine learning, especially
in the selection of data processing methods in order to achieve faster
convergence and good speedup. Our theoretical findings are verified by
extensive experiments on logistic regression and deep neural networks.

how many identities can it resolve? In other words, what is the capacity of the
face representation? A scientific basis for estimating the capacity of a given
face representation will not only benefit the evaluation and comparison of
different representation methods, but will also establish an upper bound on the
scalability of an automatic face recognition system. We cast the face capacity
problem in terms of packing bounds on a low-dimensional manifold embedded
within a deep representation space. By explicitly accounting for the manifold
structure of the representation as well two different sources of
representational noise: epistemic (model) uncertainty and aleatoric (data)
variability, our approach is able to estimate the capacity of a given face
representation. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we estimate the
capacity of two deep neural network based face representations, namely
128-dimensional FaceNet and 512-dimensional SphereFace. Numerical experiments
on unconstrained faces (IJB-C) provides a capacity upper bound of
$2.7\times10^4$ for FaceNet and $8.4\times10^4$ for SphereFace representation
at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1%. As expected, capacity reduces
drastically at lower FARs. The capacity at FAR of 0.1% and 0.001% is
$2.2\times10^3$ and $1.6\times10^{1}$, respectively for FaceNet and
$3.6\times10^3$ and $6.0\times10^0$, respectively for SphereFace.

many applications. A key step in data integration is entity consolidation. It
takes a collection of clusters of duplicate records as input and produces a
single ""golden record"" for each cluster, which contains the canonical value for
each attribute. Truth discovery and data fusion methods, as well as Master Data
Management (MDM) systems, can be used for entity consolidation. However, to
achieve better results, the variant values (i.e., values that are logically the
same with different formats) in the clusters need to be consolidated before
applying these methods.
  For this purpose, we propose a data-driven method to standardize the variant
values based on two observations: (1) the variant values usually can be
transformed to the same representation (e.g., ""Mary Lee"" and ""Lee, Mary"") and
(2) the same transformation often appears repeatedly across different clusters
(e.g., transpose the first and last name). Our approach first uses an
unsupervised method to generate groups of value pairs that can be transformed
in the same way (i.e., they share a transformation). Then the groups are
presented to a human for verification and the approved ones are used to
standardize the data. In a real-world dataset with 17,497 records, our method
achieved 75% recall and 99.5% precision in standardizing variant values by
asking a human 100 yes/no questions, which completely outperformed a state of

two additional anisotropic (nematic) (${\bf AN1}$ and ${\bf AN2}$) polymerised

voltage amplification. Because of this, conventional circuit elements such as
resistors, inductors or capacitors cannot provide amplification all by
themselves. Here, we demonstrate that a ferroelectric can cause a differential
amplification without needing such an external energy source. As the
ferroelectric switches from one polarization state to the other, a transfer of
energy takes place from the ferroelectric to the dielectric, determined by the
ratio of their capacitances, which, in turn, leads to the differential
amplification. {This amplification is very different in nature from
conventional inductor-capacitor based circuits where an oscillatory
amplification can be observed. The demonstration of differential voltage
amplification from completely passive capacitor elements only, has fundamental
ramifications for next generation electronics.

  OmniCrawler Module",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel design of an Omnidirectional bendable Omnicrawler
module- CObRaSO. Along with the longitudinal crawling and sideways rolling
motion, the performance of the OmniCrawler is further enhanced by the
introduction of Omnidirectional bending within the module, which is the key
contribution of this paper. The Omnidirectional bending is achieved by an
arrangement of two independent 1-DOF joints aligned at 90? w.r.t each other.
The unique characteristic of this module is its ability to crawl in
Omnidirectionally bent configuration which is achieved by a novel design of a
2-DOF roller chain and a backbone of a hybrid structure of a soft-rigid
material. This hybrid structure provides compliant pathways for the lug-chain
assembly to passively conform with the orientation of the module and crawl in
Omnidirectional bent configuration, which makes this module one of its kind.
Furthermore, we show that the unique modular design of CObRaSO unveils its
versatility by achieving active compliance on an uneven surface, demonstrating
its applications in different robotic platforms (an in-pipeline robot,
Quadruped and snake robot) and exhibiting hybrid locomotion modes in various
configurations of the robots. The mechanism and mobility characteristics of the
proposed module have been verified with the aid of simulations and experiments
on real robot prototype.

Appl. Math. 1966, 1969), jobs arriving online have to be assigned to machines
so to minimize an objective defined on machine loads. A long line of work has
addressed this problem for both the makespan norm and arbitrary $\ell_q$-norms
of machine loads. Recent literature (e.g., Azar et al., STOC 2013; Im et al.,
FOCS 2015) has further expanded the scope of this problem to vector loads, to
capture jobs with multi-dimensional resource requirements in applications such
as data centers. In this paper, we completely resolve the job scheduling
problem for both scalar and vector jobs on related machines, i.e., where each
machine has a given speed and the time taken to process a job is inversely
proportional to the speed of the machine it is assigned on.
  We show the following results. For scalar scheduling, we give a constant
competitive algorithm for optimizing any $\ell_q$-norm for related machines.
The only previously known result was for the makespan norm. For vector
scheduling, there are two natural variants for vector scheduling, depending on
whether the speed of a machine is dimension-dependent or not. We show a sharp
contrast between these two variants, proving that they are respectively
equivalent to unrelated machines and identical machines for the makespan norm.
We also extend these results to arbitrary $\ell_q$-norms of the machine loads.
No previous results were known for vector scheduling on related machines.

  - First we consider CF-colorings of a set $S$ of unit squares with respect to
points. Our method maintains a CF-coloring that uses $O(\log n)$ colors at any
time, where $n$ is the current number of squares in $S$, at the cost of only
$O(\log n)$ recolorings per insertion or deletion of a square. We generalize
the method to rectangles whose sides have lengths in the range $[1,c]$, where
$c$ is a fixed constant. Here the number of used colors becomes $O(\log^2 n)$.
The method also extends to arbitrary rectangles whose coordinates come from a
fixed universe of size $N$, yielding $O(\log^2 N \log^2 n)$ colors. The number
of recolorings for both methods stays in $O(\log n)$.
  - We then present a general framework to maintain a CF-coloring under
insertions for sets of objects that admit a unimax coloring with a small number
of colors in the static case. As an application we show how to maintain a
CF-coloring with $O(\log^3 n)$ colors for disks (or other objects with linear
union complexity) with respect to points at the cost of $O(\log n)$ recolorings

static unimax coloring admits weak deletions. As an application we show how to
maintain a CF-coloring with $O(\sqrt{n} \log^2 n)$ colors for points with
respect to rectangles, at the cost of $O(\log n)$ recolorings per insertion and

impact of functional predictors, the focus has been on approaches for dimension
reduction that can fail dramatically in certain applications. Examples of
standard approaches include functional linear models, functional principal
components regression, and cluster-based approaches, such as latent trajectory
analysis. This article is motivated by applications in which the dynamics in a
predictor, across times when the value is relatively extreme, are particularly
informative about the response. For example, physicians are interested in
relating the dynamics of blood pressure changes during surgery to post-surgery
adverse outcomes, and it is thought that the dynamics are more important when
blood pressure is significantly elevated or lowered.
  Methods: We propose a novel class of extrema-weighted feature (XWF)
extraction models. Key components in defining XWFs include the marginal density
of the predictor, a function up-weighting values at high quantiles of this
marginal, and functionals characterizing local dynamics. Algorithms are
proposed for fitting of XWF-based regression and classification models, and are
compared with current methods for functional predictors in simulations and a
blood pressure during surgery application.
  Results: XWFs find features of intraoperative blood pressure trajectories
that are predictive of postoperative mortality. By their nature, most of these
features cannot be found by previous methods.

substantial benefits can be obtained by modern Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). The most popular RNNs are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), which
typically reach state-of-the-art performance in many tasks thanks to their
ability to learn long-term dependencies and robustness to vanishing gradients.
Nevertheless, LSTMs have a rather complex design with three multiplicative
gates, that might impair their efficient implementation. An attempt to simplify
LSTMs has recently led to Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are based on just
two multiplicative gates.
  This paper builds on these efforts by further revising GRUs and proposing a
simplified architecture potentially more suitable for speech recognition. The
contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we suggest to remove the reset
gate in the GRU design, resulting in a more efficient single-gate architecture.
Second, we propose to replace tanh with ReLU activations in the state update
equations. Results show that, in our implementation, the revised architecture
reduces the per-epoch training time with more than 30% and consistently
improves recognition performance across different tasks, input features, and
noisy conditions when compared to a standard GRU.

for nonlinear degenerate parabolic Cauchy problems. In particular, we consider
a one-dimensional semilinear degenerate reaction-diffusion equation in
divergence form governed via the coefficient of the \-reaction term (bilinear

since the diffusion coefficient is positive on the interior of the spatial
domain and vanishes at the boundary points. Furthermore, two different kinds of
degenerate diffusion coefficient are distinguished and studied in this paper:
the weakly degenerate case, that is, if the reciprocal of the diffusion
coefficient is summable, and the strongly degenerate case, that is, if that
reciprocal isn't summable. In our main result we show that the above systems
can be steered from an initial continuous state that admits a finite number of
points of sign change to a target state with the same number of changes of sign
in the same order. Our method uses a recent technique introduced for uniformly

making use of a finite sequence of initial-value pure diffusion pro\-blems. Our

The second virial coefficient $a_2$ -- the ""excluded volume"" parameter --
calculated within the BU approach is found to be temperature dependent, and it
differs dramatically from the classical excluded volume (EV) model result. At
temperatures $T =100-200$ MeV, the widely used classical EV model
underestimates the EV parameter for nucleons at a given value of the nucleon
hard-core radius by large factors of 3-4. Previous studies, which employed the
hard-core radii of hadrons as an input into the classical EV model, have to be
re-evaluated using the appropriately rescaled EV parameters. The BU approach is
used to model the repulsive baryonic interactions in the hadron resonance gas
(HRG) model. Lattice data for the second and fourth order net baryon
susceptibilities are described fairly well when the temperature dependent BU
baryonic excluded volume parameter corresponds to nucleon hard-core radii of
$r_c = 0.25-0.3$ fm. Role of the attractive baryonic interactions is also
considered. It is argued that HRG model with a constant baryon-baryon EV

direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in a sub-Nyquist sampling framework.
Specifically, considering a scenario where a few uncorrelated narrowband
signals spread over a wide (say, several GHz) frequency band, our objective is
to estimate the carrier frequencies and the DoAs associated with the narrowband
sources, as well as reconstruct the power spectra of these narrowband signals.
To overcome the sampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, we
propose a new phased-array based sub-Nyquist sampling architecture with
variable time delays, where a uniform linear array (ULA) is employed and the
received signal at each antenna is delayed by a variable amount of time and
then sampled by a synchronized low-rate analog-digital converter (ADC). Based
on the collected sub-Nyquist samples, we calculate a set of cross-correlation
matrices with different time lags, and develop a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition-based method for joint DoA, carrier frequency and power spectrum
recovery. Perfect recovery conditions for the associated parameters and the
power spectrum are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that our proposed method does
not require to place any sparse constraint on the wideband spectrum, only needs
the sampling rate to be greater than the bandwidth of the narrowband source
signal with the largest bandwidth among all sources. Simulation results show
that our proposed method can achieve an estimation accuracy close to the
associated Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) using only a small number of data
samples.

the rapid drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) via basement membranes (BM) of

associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously
shown that arterial pulsations from the heart beat are not strong enough to

mechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia,
that is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased
neuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through
the vascular basement membrane. It accounts for waste clearance rates observed
in mouse experiments and aligns with pathological observations as well as
recommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as keeping mentally

dynamically changing electrical field topographies recorded via an array of
electrodes from the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The
sequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered
an information source with unknown underlying structure. $\epsilon$-machines
are discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on
different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate).
They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive
manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the
source. Here we present experiments using both simulations and empirical data
supporting the value of associating these discrete dynamical systems with
mental states (e.g. mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical
populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical populations can
then be further characterized by properties of these dynamical systems,
including: i) statistical complexity (determined by the number of states of the
corresponding $\epsilon$-automaton); ii) entropy rate; iii) characteristic
sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic grammars); iv) duration, persistence
and stability of dynamical patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as
Krohn-Rhodes complexity or holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The
potential applications include the characterization of mental states in
neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being interventions,
human-machine interface, and others on both subject-specific and

gradual long-duration events (LDE) among C- and $\geq$M1.0-class flares. It is
found that the fraction of the SDE $\geq$M1.0-class flares (including spikes)
in Cycle 24 exceeds that in Cycle 23 in all three temporal parameters at the
maximum phase and in the decay time during the ascending cycle phase. However,
Cycles 23 and 24 barely differ in the fraction of the SDE C-class flares. The
temporal parameters of SDEs, their fraction, and consequently the relationship
between the SDE and LDE flares do not remain constant, but they reveal regular
changes within individual cycles and during the transition from one cycle to
another. In all phases of all four cycles, these changes have the character of
pronounced, large-amplitude ""quasi-biennial"" oscillations (QBOs). In different
cycles and at the separate phases of individual cycles, such QBOs are
superimposed on various systematic trends displayed by the analyzed temporal
flare parameters. In Cycle 24, the fraction of the SDE $\geq$M1.0-class flares
from the N- and S-hemispheres displays the most pronounced synchronous QBOs.
The QBO amplitude and general variability of the intense $\geq$M1.0-class
flares almost always markedly exceeds those of the moderate C-class flares. The
ordered quantitative and qualitative variations of the flare type revealed in
the course of the solar cycles are discussed within the framework of the
concept that the SDE flares are associated mainly with small sunspots
(including those in developed active regions) and that small and large sunspots
behave differently during cycles and form two distinct populations.

macroscopic particles confined to a two-dimensional bounded domain. Discounting
the forcing action of the external periodic actuation, the particles show
translational velocities and diffusivity consistent with a confined random walk
model. Such experimental system may therefore represent a suitable macroscopic
analog to investigate aspects of molecular dynamics and self-assembly.

fluorescence lifetime measurements is usually limited in speed due to pile-up.
With modern instrumentation this limitation can be lifted significantly but
some artefacts due to frequent merging of closely spaced detector pulses
(detector pulse pile-up) remains an issue to be addressed. We propose here a
data analysis method correcting for this type of artefact and the resulting
systematic errors. It physically models the photon losses due to detector pulse
pile-up and incorporates the loss in the decay fit model employed to obtain
fluorescence lifetimes and relative amplitudes of the decay components.
Comparison of results with and without this correction show a significant
reduction of systematic errors at count rates approaching the excitation rate.
This allows quantitatively accurate fluorescense lifetime imaging (FLIM) at
very high frame rates.
