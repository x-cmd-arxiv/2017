the context of this toy model, a general formalism is presented for SU(N)
theories. The sign problem that the theory displays is a genuine one, stemming
from a (quark) chemical potential. Three stationary points are present in the
original (real) domain of integration, so that contributions from all the
thimbles associated to them are to be taken into account: we show how
semiclassical computations can provide hints on the regions of parameter space
where this is absolutely crucial. Known analytical results for the chiral
condensate and the Polyakov loop are correctly reproduced: this is in
particular trivial at high values of the number of flavors N_f. In this regime
we notice that the single thimble dominance scenario takes place (the dominant
thimble is the one associated to the identity). At low values of N_f
computations can be more difficult. It is important to stress that this is not
at all a consequence of the original sign problem (not even via the residual
phase). The latter is always under control, while accidental, delicate
cancelations of contributions coming from different thimbles can be in place in
(restricted) regions of the parameter space.

feature of quantum physics. However this incompatibility does not extend to
observables which are periodic in these base variables. Such modular-variable
observables have been suggested as tools for fault-tolerant quantum computing
and enhanced quantum sensing. Here we implement sequential measurements of
modular variables in the oscillatory motion of a single trapped ion, using
state-dependent displacements and a heralded non-destructive readout. We
investigate the commutative nature of modular variable observables by
demonstrating no-signaling-in-time between successive measurements, using a
variety of input states. In the presence of quantum interference, which we
enhance using squeezed input states, measurements of different periodicity show
signaling-in-time. The sequential measurements allow us to extract two-time
correlators for modular variables, which we use to violate a Leggett-Garg
inequality. The experiments involve control and coherence of multi-component
superpositions of up to 8 coherent, squeezed or Fock state wave-packets.
Signaling-in-time as well as Leggett-Garg inequalities serve as efficient
quantum witnesses which we probe here with a mechanical oscillator, a system
which has a natural crossover from the quantum to the classical regime.

thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates
is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the

experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase
throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we
have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a

flexible loads, to better match electricity demand to power generation. A
common mechanism is peak pricing (PP), where consumers pay reduced (increased)
prices for electricity during periods of low (high) demand, and its simplicity
allows consumers to understand how their consumption affects costs. However,
new consumer technologies like internet-connected smart thermostats simplify
real-time pricing (RP), because such devices can automate the tradeoff between
costs and consumption. These devices enable consumer choice under RP by
abstracting this tradeoff into a question of quality of service (e.g., comfort)
versus price. This paper uses a principal-agent framework to design PP and RP
rates for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) to address adverse
selection due to variations in consumer comfort preferences. We formulate the
pricing problem as a stochastic bilevel program, and numerically solve it by
reformulation as a mixed integer program (MIP). Last, we compare the
effectiveness of different pricing schemes on reductions of peak load or load
variability. We find that PP pricing induces HVAC consumption to spike high
(before), spike low (during), and spike high (after) the PP event, whereas RP
achieves reductions in peak loads and load variability while preventing large
spikes in electricity usage.

We predict bounds for the ion-atom scattering length from ab initio
calculations of the interaction potential. We demonstrate that, in the
predicted bounds, the scattering length can be experimentally determined from
the velocity of the scattered wavepacket in the case of
$^\textsf{6}\textsf{Li}^\textsf{+}$ - $^\textsf{6}\textsf{Li}$, and from the
molecular ion fraction in the case of $^\textsf{7}\textsf{Li}^\textsf{+}$ -
$^\textsf{7}\textsf{Li}$. The proposed method to utilize Rydberg molecules for
ultracold ion-atom scattering, here particularized for the lithium ion-atom
system, is readily applicable to other ion-atom systems as well.

  Graphs for Robot Navigation","ICRA 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enabling robots to autonomously navigate complex environments is essential
for real-world deployment. Prior methods approach this problem by having the
robot maintain an internal map of the world, and then use a localization and
planning method to navigate through the internal map. However, these approaches
often include a variety of assumptions, are computationally intensive, and do
not learn from failures. In contrast, learning-based methods improve as the
robot acts in the environment, but are difficult to deploy in the real-world
due to their high sample complexity. To address the need to learn complex
policies with few samples, we propose a generalized computation graph that
subsumes value-based model-free methods and model-based methods, with specific
instantiations interpolating between model-free and model-based. We then
instantiate this graph to form a navigation model that learns from raw images
and is sample efficient. Our simulated car experiments explore the design
decisions of our navigation model, and show our approach outperforms
single-step and $N$-step double Q-learning. We also evaluate our approach on a
real-world RC car and show it can learn to navigate through a complex indoor
environment with a few hours of fully autonomous, self-supervised training.

Here we demonstrate how these undesirable properties of the LWF can lead to a
failure of computational methods based on an approximation of the LWF. We apply
the Nested Cluster Scheme (NCS) to the Hubbard model and observe the existence
of an additional stationary point of the self-consistent equations, associated
with an unphysical branch of the LWF. In the strongly correlated regime,
starting with the first divergence of $\Gamma$, this unphysical stationary

invariant with respect to a subject anatomical variations and data sampling
rate. The discovered primitives are unknown and unlabeled and are
unsupervisedly collected into classes via a hierarchical non-parametric Bayes
mixture model. Once classes are determined and labeled they are further
analyzed for establishing models for recognizing discovered primitives. Each
primitive model is defined by a set of learned parameters.
  Given new video data and given the estimated pose of the subject appearing on

probability given according to the parameters of the learned models.

1% of solar-type field stars. One possible formation scenario for HJs is
high-eccentricity (high-e) migration, in which the planet forms at much larger
radii, is excited to high eccentricity by some mechanism, and migrates to its
current orbit due to tidal dissipation occurring near periapsis. We consider
high-e migration in dense stellar systems such as the cores of globular
clusters (GCs), in which encounters with passing stars can excite planets to
the high eccentricities needed to initiate migration. We study this process via
Monte Carlo simulations of encounters with a star+planet system including the
effects of tidal dissipation, using an efficient regularized restricted
three-body code. HJs are produced in our simulations over a significant range
of the stellar number density n_*. Assuming the planet is initially on a
low-eccentricity orbit with semimajor axis 1 au, for n_* < 1e3 pc^{-3} the
encounter rate is too low to induce orbital migration, whereas for n_* > 1e6
pc^{-3} HJ formation is suppressed because the planet is more likely ejected
from its host star, tidally disrupted, or transferred to a perturbing star. The
fraction of planets that are converted to HJs peaks at ~ 2% for intermediate
number densities of ~ 4e4 pc^{-3}. Warm Jupiters, giant planets with periods
between 10 and 100 days, are produced in our simulations with an efficiency of
up to ~ 0.5%. Our results suggest that HJs can form through high-e migration
induced by stellar encounters in the centers of of dense GCs, but not in their
outskirts where the densities are lower.

does not resort to stacking the weak lensing signal in bins, and thus allows
for a more efficient use of the information content in the data. Our method is
particularly useful for constraining scaling relations between two or more
galaxy properties and dark matter halo mass, and can also be used to constrain
the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations. We show that, if
observational scatter is not properly accounted for, the traditional stacking
method can produce biased results when exploring correlations between multiple
galaxy properties and halo mass. For example, this bias can affect studies of
the joint correlation between galaxy mass, halo mass, and galaxy size, or
galaxy color. In contrast, our method easily and efficiently handles the
intrinsic and observational scatter in multiple galaxy properties and halo
mass. We test our method on mocks with varying degrees of complexity. We find
that we can recover the mean halo mass and concentration, each with a $0.1$ dex
accuracy, and the intrinsic scatter in halo mass with a $0.05$ dex accuracy. In

sizes when measured using rest-frame optical B-band light than rest-frame UV
light; sizes measured from stellar mass surface density are even larger. The UV
morphologies are usually dominated by several small, bright young stellar
clumps that are not always associated with significant stellar mass. The B-band
light traces stellar mass better than the UV, but it can also be biased by the
bright clumps. At all redshifts, galaxy size correlates with stellar

prescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation, water ice
evaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water
vapor, and planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single,
one-dimensional model for protoplanetary disk evolution. We find that processes
taking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal formation in two
ways. First, due to the change of sticking properties between wet and dry
aggregates, there is a ""traffic jam"" inside of the snow line that slows down
the fall of solids onto the star. Second, ice evaporation and outward diffusion
of water followed by its recondensation increases the abundance of icy pebbles
that trigger planetesimal formation via streaming instability just outside of
the snow line. Planetesimal formation is hindered by growth barriers and radial
drift and thus requires particular conditions to take place. Snow line is a
favorable location where planetesimal formation is possible for a wide range of
conditions, but still not in every protoplanetary disk model. This process is
particularly promoted in large, cool disks with low intrinsic turbulence and
increased initial dust-to-gas ratio.

increasingly important role at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These
observables are often used in conjunction with jet grooming algorithms, which
reduce contamination from both theoretical and experimental sources. In this
paper we derive factorization formulae for groomed multi-prong substructure
observables, focusing in particular on the groomed $D_2$ observable, which is
used to identify boosted hadronic decays of electroweak bosons at the LHC. Our
factorization formulae allow systematically improvable calculations of the
perturbative $D_2$ distribution and the resummation of logarithmically enhanced
terms in all regions of phase space using renormalization group evolution. They
include a novel factorization for the production of a soft subjet in the
presence of a grooming algorithm, in which clustering effects enter directly
into the hard matching. We use these factorization formulae to draw robust
conclusions of experimental relevance regarding the universality of the $D_2$
distribution in both $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions. In particular, we show that
the only process dependence is carried by the relative quark vs. gluon jet
fraction in the sample, no non-global logarithms from event-wide correlations
are present in the distribution, hadronization corrections are controlled by
the perturbative mass of the jet, and all global color correlations are
completely removed by grooming, making groomed $D_2$ a theoretically clean QCD
observable even in the LHC environment. We compute all ingredients to one-loop
accuracy, and present numerical results at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy
for $e^+e^-$ collisions, comparing with parton shower Monte Carlo simulations.
Results for $pp$ collisions, as relevant for phenomenology at the LHC, are
presented in a companion paper.

superflares in sun-like stars which exceed by far any observed solar flares in
release of energy. A natural idea is that the dynamo mechanism in superflaring
stars differs in some respect from that in the Sun. We search for a difference
in the dynamo-related parameters between superflaring stars and the Sun to
suggest a dynamo-mechanism as close as possible to the conventional
solar/stellar dynamo but capable of providing much higher magnetic energy.
Dynamo based on joint action of differential rotation and mirror asymmetric
motions can in principle result in excitation of two types of magnetic fields.
First of all, it is well-known in solar physics dynamo waves. The point is that
another magnetic configuration with initial growth and further stabilisation is
also possible for excitation. For comparable conditions, magnetic field
strength of second configuration is much larger rather of the first one just
because dynamo do not spend its efforts for periodic magnetic field inversions
but use its for magnetic field growth. We analysed available data from the
Kepler mission concerning the superflaring stars in order to find tracers of
anomalous magnetic activity. Starting from the recent paper, we find that
anti-solar differential rotation or anti-solar sign of the mirror-asymmetry of
stellar convection can provide the desired strong magnetic field in dynamo
models. We confirm this concept by numerical models of stellar dynamos with
corresponding governing parameters. We conclude that the proposed mechanism can
plausibly explain the superflaring events at least for some cool stars,
including binaries, subgiants and, possibly, low-mass stars and young rapid
rotators.

the rotational-fission mechanism. Eureka's spectrum exhibits a broad and deep
absorption band around 1 {\mu}m, indicating an olivine-rich composition. Here
we show evidence that the Trojan Eureka cluster progenitor could have
originated as impact debris excavated from the Martian mantle. We present new

an achondritic composition. Olivine-rich reflectance spectra are rare amongst
asteroids but are seen around the largest basins on Mars. They are also
consistent with some Martian meteorites (e.g. Chassigny), and with the material

lattice composed of Fe^{3+} triangular units. Frustration, due to competing
near neighbor ($J_1$) and next nearest neighbor ($J_2$) antiferromagnetic
interactions, was recently suggested to be the origin of an antiferromagnetic
helical ground state with unusual needle-like nanoscale magnetic domains in
Fe3PO4O3. Magnetic dilution is shown here to tune the ratio of these magnetic
interactions, thus providing deeper insight into this unconventional
antiferromagnet. Dilution of the Fe^{3+} lattice in Fe3PO4O3 was accomplished
by substituting non-magnetic Ga^{3+} to form the solid solution series
Fe_{3-x}Ga_xPO4O3 with $x = 0.012, 0.06, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5$. Magnetic
susceptibility and neutron powder diffraction data from this series are
presented. A continuous decrease of the both the helical pitch length and the
domain size is observed with increasing dilution up to at least $x = 0.25$,
while for $x \ge 0.5$, the compounds lack long range magnetic order entirely.
The decrease in the helical pitch length with increasing $x$ can be
qualitatively understood by reduction of the ratio of $J_2/J_1$ in the
Heisenberg model, consistent with mean field considerations. Intriguingly, the
magnetic correlation length in the $ab$ plane remains nearly equal to the pitch
length for each value of $x \le 0.25$, showing that the two quantities are
intrinsically connected in this unusual antiferromagnet.

Because the higher number of applications makes the interaction and impacts of

challenging. Memory-level parallelism (MLP) aware replacement algorithms in

performed by the normal compositional model (NCM), where the endmembers for
each pixel are assumed to be sampled from unimodal Gaussian distributions.
However, in real applications, the distribution of a material is often not
Gaussian. In this paper, we use Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to represent the
endmember variability. We show, given the GMM starting premise, that the
distribution of the mixed pixel (under the linear mixing model) is also a GMM
(and this is shown from two perspectives). The first perspective originates
from the random variable transformation and gives a conditional density
function of the pixels given the abundances and GMM parameters. With proper
smoothness and sparsity prior constraints on the abundances, the conditional
density function leads to a standard maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem which
can be solved using generalized expectation maximization. The second
perspective originates from marginalizing over the endmembers in the GMM, which
provides us with a foundation to solve for the endmembers at each pixel. Hence,
our model can not only estimate the abundances and distribution parameters, but
also the distinct endmember set for each pixel. We tested the proposed GMM on
several synthetic and real datasets, and showed its potential by comparing it
to current popular methods.

Gibbs measure $\mu_{\nu}$ on
  $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{T}^d$. Under certain assumptions on the dynamics
the converse is also true.
  A second result concerns proving sufficient conditions for ergodicity and
non-ergodicity of our PCA on d-ary trees for $d\in \{ 1,2,3\}$ and
characterizing the invariant product Bernoulli measures.

$a_1, \ldots, a_r$, investigates the system of inequalities $\pi(x;q,a_1) >

initiated by Chebyshev and further studied by many others, including
Littlewood, Shanks-R\'{e}nyi, Knapowski-Turan, and Kaczorowski. We expect that
this system of inequalities should have arbitrarily large solutions $x$, and
moreover we expect the same to be true no matter how we permute the residue
classes $a_j$; if this is the case, and if the logarithmic density of the set
of such $x$ exists and is positive, the prime number race is called inclusive.
In breakthrough research, Rubinstein and Sarnak proved conditionally that every
prime number race is inclusive; they assumed not only the generalized Riemann
hypothesis but also a strong statement about the linear independence of the
zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions. We show that the same conclusion can be
reached assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis and a substantially weaker
linear independence hypothesis. In fact, we can assume that almost all of the
zeros may be involved in $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations; and we can also
conclude more strongly that the associated limiting distribution has mass
everywhere. This work makes use of a number of ideas from probability, the
explicit formula from number theory, and the Kronecker-Weyl equidistribution

systems, so dc systems are being introduced as emerging practical investment
solutions compared to traditional ac options. DC microgrids offer several
advantages such as the elimination of need for synchronizing generators and
easier supply of dc loads. Hybrid microgrids can benefit from the advantages of
both ac and dc microgrid types. Moreover, there would be a huge reduction in
the number of required power converters which would enhance the microgrid
efficiency and reduce investment and operation costs. This paper introduces
hybrid ac/dc microgrid as a viable solution compared to individual ac or dc
microgrids and focuses on its planning. The objective of the hybrid microgrid
planning is to minimize the microgrid total cost, including investment cost of
distributed energy resources (DERs) and converters, operation cost of DERs, the
cost of energy exchange with the utility grid, and the cost of unserved energy
during the planning horizon. The economic viability of the microgrid planning
is investigated in this paper and it is shown how the optimal DER generation
mix, the type of feeders, as well as the point of connection of DERs to feeders
can be determined by updating the traditional ac microgrid planning model.
Numerical simulations on a test microgrid exhibit the merits of the proposed
model.

analyze several methods of approximate sampling based on discretizations of the

measured in the Wasserstein-2 distance. Our guarantees improve or extend the
state-of-the-art results in three directions. First, we provide an upper bound
on the error of the first-order Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm with
optimized varying step-size. This result has the advantage of being horizon
free (we do not need to know in advance the target precision) and to improve by
a logarithmic factor the corresponding result for the constant step-size.
Second, we study the case where accurate evaluations of the gradient of the
log-density are unavailable, but one can have access to approximations of the
aforementioned gradient. In such a situation, we consider both deterministic
and stochastic approximations of the gradient and provide an upper bound on the
sampling error of the first-order LMC that quantifies the impact of the
gradient evaluation inaccuracies. Third, we establish upper bounds for two
versions of the second-order LMC, which leverage the Hessian of the
log-density. We nonasymptotic guarantees on the sampling error of these

uniform flat surface or perfect sphere, the unstable modes and final patterns
are degenerate, reflecting translational/rotational symmetry. This symmetry can
be broken, e.g. by a bump on a flat substrate or by deforming a sphere. As the
diffusion operator on a two dimensional manifold depends on the underlying
curvature, the degeneracy of the initial unstable mode is similarly reduced.
Different shapes can pin different modes. We adapt methods of conformal mapping

modes of the diffusion operator on cylinders and spheres. We confirm these
results numerically, and provide closed form expressions that describe how

make in-plane changes to the satellite orbits. We propose an efficient method
to separate a cluster of satellites into a desired constellation shape while
respecting actuation constraints and maximizing the operational lifetime of the
constellation. By posing the problem as a linear program, we solve for the
optimal drag commands for each of the satellites on a daily basis with a
shrinking-horizon model predictive control approach. We then apply this control
strategy in a nonlinear orbital dynamics simulation with a simple, varying
atmospheric density model. We demonstrate the ability to control a cluster of
100+ satellites starting at the same initial conditions in a circular low Earth
orbit to form an equally spaced constellation (with a relative angular
separation error tolerance of one-tenth a degree). The constellation separation
task can be executed in 71 days, a time frame that is competitive for the
state-of-the-practice. This method allows us to trade the time required to
converge to the desired constellation with a sacrifice in the overall
constellation lifetime, measured as the maximum altitude loss experienced by
one of the satellites in the group after the separation maneuvers.

improved efficiency fuzzy logic and humoral regulation inspired topology
control into the opportunistic routing algorithm. In CBRT, the inputs of the
fuzzy logic system are the relative variance (rv) of the metrics rather than
the values of the metrics, which reduces the number of fuzzy rules
dramatically. Moreover, the number of fuzzy rules does not increase when the
number of inputs increases. For reducing the control cost, in CBRT, the node
degree in the candidate relays set is a range rather than a constant number.
The nodes are divided into different categories based on their node degree in
the candidate relays set. The nodes adjust their transmission range based on
which categories that they belong to. Additionally, for investigating the
effection of the node mobility on routing performance, we propose a link
lifetime prediction algorithm which takes both the moving speed and moving
direction into account. In CBRT, the source node determines the relaying
priorities of the relaying nodes based on their utilities. The relaying node
which the utility is large will have high priority to relay the data packet. By
these innovations, the network performance in CBRT is much better than that in
ExOR, however, the computation complexity is not increased in CBRT.

responsible for releasing much of the slow solar wind, in particular along
topological features known as the Separatrix-Web (S-Web). Here, we continue our
analysis, focusing on two specific aspects of structured slow solar wind
variability. The first type is present in the slow solar wind found near the

the evolution of three-dimensional magnetic flux ropes formed at the top of the

distributions and correlations in prompt data, e.g., multiplicity-dependent
neutron and \gray~spectra, angular distributions of the emitted particles,
$n$-$n$, $n$-$\gamma$, and $\gamma$-$\gamma$~correlations, can place stringent
constraints on fission models and parameters that would otherwise be free to be
tuned separately to represent individual fission observables. The FREYA~and
CGMF~codes have been developed to follow the sequential emissions of prompt
neutrons and $\gamma$-rays~from the initial excited fission fragments produced
right after scission. Both codes implement Monte Carlo techniques to sample
initial fission fragment configurations in mass, charge and kinetic energy and
sample probabilities of neutron and $\gamma$~emission at each stage of the
decay. This approach naturally leads to using simple but powerful statistical
techniques to infer distributions and correlations among many observables and
model parameters. The comparison of model calculations with experimental data
provides a rich arena for testing various nuclear physics models such as those
related to the nuclear structure and level densities of neutron-rich nuclei,
the $\gamma$-ray~strength functions of dipole and quadrupole transitions, the
mechanism for dividing the excitation energy between the two nascent fragments
near scission, and the mechanisms behind the production of angular momentum in
the fragments, etc. Beyond the obvious interest from a fundamental physics
point of view, such studies are also important for addressing data needs in
various nuclear applications. (See text for full abstract.)

Cryogenic space-borne infrared telescopes can experience a wavefront error due

worse. For on-orbit wavefront correction as one solution, we developed a
MEMS-processed electro-static DM with a special surrounding structure for use
under the cryogenic temperature. We conducted a laboratory demonstration of its
operation in three cooling cycles between 5 K and 295 K. Using a laser
interferometer, we detected the deformation corresponding to the applied
voltages under the cryogenic temperature for the first time. The relationship
between voltages and displacements was qualitatively expressed by the quadratic
function, which is assumed based on the principle of electro-static DMs. We
also found that it had a high operating repeatability of a few nm RMS and no
significant hysteresis. Using the measured values of repeatability, we
simulated the improvement of PSF by wavefront correction with our DM. These
results show that our developed DM is effective in improving imaging
performance and PSF contrast of space-borne infrared telescopes.

however, recent technologies, such as Software-Defined Networking, may let
operators run their networks harder (i.e., at higher utilization levels).
Higher utilization can increase the network operator's revenue, but this gain
comes at a cost: daily traffic fluctuations and failures might occasionally
overload the network. We call such situations Resource Crunch. Dealing with
Resource Crunch requires certain types of flexibility in the system. We focus
on scenarios with flexible bandwidth requirements, e.g., some connections can
tolerate lower bandwidth allocation. This may free capacity to provision new
requests that would otherwise be blocked. For that, the network operator needs
to make an informed decision, since reducing the bandwidth of a high-paying
connection to allocate a low-value connection is not sensible. We propose a
strategy to decide whether or not to provision a request (and which other
connections to degrade) focusing on maximizing profits during Resource Crunch.
To address this problem, we use an abstraction of the network state, called a
Connection Adjacency Graph (CAG). We propose PROVISIONER, which integrates our
CAG solution with an efficient Linear Program (LP). We compare our method to
existing greedy approaches and to LP-only solutions, and show that our method
outperforms them during Resource Crunch.

our understanding about blood clot formation and its relation-ship with

for autonomous mobile service robots. While most previously reported methods
are based on learning of 2D positions in monocular camera images, our approach
uses range-finder sensors to learn and predict 3DOF pose trajectories (i.e. 2D
position plus 1D rotation within the world coordinate system). Our approach,
T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using
long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn
context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our
approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with
short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM
encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then
decodes as predictions. For deployment, it can perform on-the-fly prediction in
real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human
detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global
coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15K pedestrian
trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months.
The experiment shows that the proposed T-Pose-LSTM model advances the

region, which contains about 7\% of the LIGO localization probability, and the
same field is observed in three different epochs. The detectable magnitude of
the candidates in a differenced image is evaluated as $i \sim 23.2$ mag for the
requirement of at least two 5$\sigma$ detections, and 1744 candidates are
discovered. Assuming a kilonova as an optical counterpart, we compared the
optical properties of the candidates with model predictions. A red and rapidly
declining light curve condition enables the discrimination of a kilonova from
other transients, and a small number of candidates satisfy this condition. The
presence of stellar-like counterparts in the reference frame suggests that the
surviving candidates are likely to be flare stars. The fact that most of those
candidates are in galactic plane, $|b|<5^{\circ}$, supports this
interpretation. We also checked whether the candidates are associated with the
nearby GLADE galaxies, which reduces the number of contaminants even with a
looser color cut. When a better probability map (with localization accuracy of

VoxelNet to exploit the corresponding 3D point cloud. Unlike the existing

proposed a Softmax weighted fusion stack that adaptively learns the varying

power not only all SGRBs but also most of LGRBs. Some LGRBs might do originate
from merger events in the BH hyperaccretion scenario, at least on the energy
requirement. Moreover, kilonovae might be produced by neutron-rich outflows,
and their luminosities and timescales significantly depend on the outflow
strengths. GRBs and their associated kilonovae are competitive with each other
on the disc mass and total energy budgets. The stronger the outflow, the more
similar the characteristics of kilonovae to supernovae (SNe). This kind of
`nova' might be called `quasi-SN'.

  Response Management in the Smart Grid","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology",,,,"math.OC cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By utilizing tools from game theory, we develop a novel
multi-period-multi-company demand response framework considering the
interactions between companies (sellers of energy) and their consumers (buyers
of energy). We model the interactions in terms of a Stackelberg game, where
companies set their prices and consumers respond by choosing their demands. We
show that the underlying game has a unique equilibrium at which the companies
maximize their revenues while the consumers maximize their utilities subject to
their local constraints. Closed-form expressions are provided for the optimal
strategies of all players. Based on these solutions, a power allocation game
has been formulated, which is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash
equilibrium, for which closed-form expressions are also provided. This
equilibrium is found under the assumption that companies can freely allocate
their power across the time horizon, but we also demonstrate that it is
possible to relax this assumption. We further provide a fast distributed
algorithm for the computation of all optimal strategies using only local
information. We also study the effect of variations in the number of periods
(subdivisions of the time horizon) and the number of consumers. As a
consequence, we are able to find an appropriate company-to-consumer ratio when
the number of consumers participating in demand response exceeds some
threshold. Furthermore, we show, both analytically and numerically, that the
multi-period scheme provides incentives for energy consumers to participate in
demand response, compared to the single-period framework studied in the
literature. In our framework, we provide a condition for the minimum budgets
consumers need, and carry out case studies using real life data to demonstrate
the benefits of the approach, which show potential savings of up to $30\%$ and
equilibrium prices that have low volatility.

arbitrary order and location on a nonspherical shape are studied using the
T-matrix method (TMM) in three dimensions. Based on the radiation stress tensor
approach and the multipole expansion method for the arbitrary Bessel beam, the
ARF expressions are derived in terms of the incident and scattered beam shape
coefficients independently with the corresponding homemade code packages.
Several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the versatility of the
TMM. The axial acoustic radiation forces (ARFs) of several typical shapes are
considered in the analysis with the emphasis on the axial ARF reversal and the
corresponding physical mechanism. This study may guide the experimental set-up
to find negative axial ARFs quickly and effectively based on the predicted
parameters with TMM. Relatively elongated shapes may be helpful for pulling
forces in Bessel beams. Furthermore, the lateral ARFs for both convex and
concave nonspherical shapes are also investigated with different topological
charges, cone angles and offsets of the particle centroid to the beam axis in a
broadband frequency regime. A brief theoretical derivation of the incident beam
shape coefficients for the standing Bessel beams is also given. The present

primordial black holes and scalar field dark matter. Based on a simple analytic
model, we study lensing properties of a point mass lens embedded in a high
magnification region, and derive the dependence of the peak brightness,
microlensing time scales, and event rates on the mass of the point mass lens as
well as the radius of a source star that is magnified. We find that the lens
mass and source radius of the first event MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1 (LS1) are
constrained, with the lens mass range of $0.1~M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim
4\times 10^3M_\odot$ and the source radius range of $40~R_\odot \lesssim R
\lesssim 260~R_\odot$. In the most plausible case with $M\approx 0.3~M_\odot$
and $R\approx 180~R_\odot$, the source star should have been magnified by a
factor of $\approx 4300$ at the peak. The derived lens properties are fully
consistent with the interpretation that MACS J1149 LS1 is a microlensing event
produced by a star that contributes to the intra-cluster light. We argue that
compact dark matter models with high fractional mass densities for the mass
range $10^{-5}M_\odot \lesssim M\lesssim 10^2M_\odot$ are inconsistent with the
observation of MACS J1149 LS1 because such models predict too low

a sparse random effects model. The spatial localization of needlets, together
with carefully chosen random coefficients, ensure the model to be non-Gaussian

variance profile. The special formulation of the model enables us to develop
efficient estimation and prediction procedures, in which an adaptive MCMC
algorithm is used. We investigate the accuracy of parameter estimation of the

symmetric hyperbolic-parabolic systems. From the point of view of
dissipativity, Kawashima in his doctoral dissertation established the optimal
time-decay estimates of $L^{q}$-$L^{2}(q\in [1,2)$) type for solutions to the
MHD system. Here, we shall improve Kawashima's efforts and give more precise
description for the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions, not only in
extra Lebesgue spaces but also in a full family of Besov norms with the
negative regularity index. Precisely, we show that the $L^{p}$ norm (the
slightly stronger $\dot{B}^{0}_{p,1}$ one in fact) of global solutions with the
critical regularity, decays like $t^{-d(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{4})}$ for
$t\rightarrow\infty$. In particular, taking $p=2$ and $d=3$ goes back to the
classical time decay $t^{-\frac{3}{4}}$. We derive new estimates which are used
to deal with the strong coupling between the magnetic field and fluid dynamics.

the spatial resolution of ultrasound (US) imaging and the contrast of pure

The solutions of some generalized dynamical equations are provided closed

Furthermore, users usually pay attention to 1) self history for reasoning and
2) others' utterances for listening, the speaker of the utterances may provides
informative cues to help understanding. Therefore, this paper proposes an
attention-based network that additionally leverages temporal information and
speaker role for better SLU, where the attention to contexts and speaker roles
can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. The experiments on the

representation for feature pooling. However, there are three main problems
about this kind of pooling method. First, the histogram-based pooling method
binarizes the feature maps and leads to inevitable discriminative information
loss. Second, it is difficult to effectively combine other visual cues into a
compact representation, because the simple concatenation of various visual cues
leads to feature representation inefficiency. Third, the dimensionality of
histogram-based output grows exponentially with the number of feature maps
used. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a novel shallow network
model, named as PCANet-II. Compared with the histogram-based output, the second
order pooling not only provides more discriminative information by preserving
both the magnitude and sign of convolutional responses, but also dramatically
reduces the size of output features. Thus we combine the second order
statistical pooling method with the shallow network, i.e., PCANet. Moreover, it
is easy to combine other discriminative and robust cues by using the second
order pooling. So we introduce the binary feature difference encoding scheme
into our PCANet-II to further improve robustness. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our proposed PCANet-II method.

efficiently utilize energy in ambient environment, the UAV's transmission
capability is powered exclusively by radio signal transmitted from the source
via the power-splitting mechanism. In such a cooperative communication system,
we study the end-to-end cooperative throughput maximization problem by
optimizing the UAV's power profile, power-splitting ratio profile and
trajectory for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
protocols. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: profile optimization
given trajectory and trajectory optimization given profile. The former one is
solved via the dual decomposition with in-depth analysis and the latter one is
solved via successive convex optimization, by which a lower bound is
iteratively maximized. Then the end-to-end cooperative throughput maximization
problem is solved by alternately solving the two subproblems. The numerical
results show that with the proposed optimal solution, choice for the UAV's
power profile and power-splitting ratio profile is more long-sighted than the
greedy strategy from our previous work and the successive optimization is able
to converge in a few rounds of iteration. Moreover, as for the end-to-end
cooperative throughput, the proposed optimal solution outperforms both static
and greedy strategies, especially for the AF protocol.

attention from the evolutionary computation research community. Much effort has
been devoted to addressing this issue by improving the scalability of
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as Pareto-based,
decomposition-based, and indicator-based approaches. Different from current
work, we propose a novel algorithm in this paper called AnD, which consists of
an angle-based selection strategy and a shift-based density estimation
strategy. These two strategies are employed in the environmental selection to
delete the poor individuals one by one. Specifically, the former is devised to
find a pair of individuals with the minimum vector angle, which means that
these two individuals share the most similar search direction. The latter,
which takes both the diversity and convergence into account, is adopted to
compare these two individuals and to delete the worse one. AnD has a simple
structure, few parameters, and no complicated operators. The performance of AnD
is compared with that of seven state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary
algorithms on a variety of benchmark test problems with up to 15 objectives.
The experimental results suggest that AnD can achieve highly competitive
performance. In addition, we also verify that AnD can be readily extended to
solve constrained many-objective optimization problems.

minimize the model dependence of the approach and to reach the required
accuracy: the contribution to the cross section from inelastic scattering has
to be measured separately in order to allow a direct comparison of experimental
cross sections to theoretical cross sections based on density functional theory
and eikonal theory. The accuracy of the reaction model should be investigated
and quantified by the energy and target dependence of various nucleon-removal

cross sections on the neutron skin of medium-heavy neutron-rich nuclei, and we
demonstrate that the slope parameter L of the symmetry energy could be
constrained down to +/-10 MeV by such a measurement with a 2% accuracy of the

(FDRS) in spectrum-sharing networks. Contrary to half-duplex relaying,
full-duplex relaying (FDR) enables simultaneous listening/forwarding at the
secondary relay(s), thereby allowing for a higher spectral efficiency. However,
since the source and relay simultaneously transmit in FDR, their superimposed
signal at the primary receiver should now satisfy the existing interference
constraint, which can considerably limit the secondary network throughput. In
this regard, relay selection can offer an adequate solution to boost the
secondary throughput while satisfying the imposed interference limit. We first
analyze the performance of opportunistic FDRS with residual self-interference
(RSI) by deriving the exact cumulative distribution function of its end-to-end
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio under Nakagami-m fading. We also
evaluate the offered diversity gain of relay selection for different
full-duplex cooperation schemes in the presence/absence of a direct
source-destination link. When the adopted RSI link gain model is sublinear in
the relay power, which agrees with recent research findings, we show that
remarkable diversity gain can be recovered even in the presence of an
interfering direct link. Second, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of FDRS
with interference constraints due to the presence of a primary receiver.
Finally, the presented exact theoretical findings are verified by numerical

high-$Q$ circular microresonator. The coupling is critical if the intrinsic
resonator losses equate the coupling losses to the waveguide. When this
happens, the transmittance of the waveguide displays resonance dips with
maximal depth as the frequency is swept through the resonators resonances. We
show that multiple configurations, parameterised by the minimal distance
between the resonator and the waveguide, can lead to critical coupling. Indeed,
for a sufficiently large resonator radius, the flow of power between the
waveguide and the resonator can change sign several times within a single pass.
This leads to an oscillatory coupling parameter as a function of the separation
distance. As a result, multiple geometrical configurations can lead to critical
coupling, even if the waveguide lies in the equatorial plane of the resonator.
These results are explained using coupled-mode theory and full wave numerical
simulations. In the vicinity of secondary or higher-order critical coupling,
the depth of the transmittance dip is very sensitive to the environment. We
discuss how this effect can be exploited for sensing purpose. Alternatively, by
actively controlling the environment in the secondary critical configuration,
the waveguide/resonator system can be driven as an optical switch.

$\kappa_{hVV}\in[0.93,1.15]$ in the allowed parameter space. For the

should be observed using two-minute observations. TESS has the opportunity to
search tens of thousands of nearby, cool, late K and M-type dwarfs for
transiting exoplanets, an order of magnitude more than current or previous
transiting exoplanet surveys, such as {\it Kepler}, K2 and ground-based
programs. This necessitates a new approach to choosing cool dwarf targets. Cool
dwarfs were chosen by collating parallax and proper motion catalogs from the
literature and subjecting them to a variety of selection criteria. We calculate
stellar parameters and TESS magnitudes using the best possible relations from
the literature while maintaining uniformity of methods for the sake of
reproducibility. We estimate the expected planet yield from TESS observations
using statistical results from the Kepler Mission, and use these results to
choose the best targets for two-minute observations, optimizing for small
planets for which masses can conceivably be measured using follow up Doppler
spectroscopy by current and future Doppler spectrometers. The catalog is
incorporated into the TESS Input Catalog and TESS Candidate Target List until a
more complete and accurate cool dwarf catalog identified by ESA's Gaia Mission

sequence of Cloud Optical Depth (COD) images. The algorithm is based on the
following simple observation: the dynamics of clouds represented by COD images
resembles the motion (transport) of a density in a fluid flow. This suggests
that, to forecast the motion of COD images, it is sufficient to forecast the
flow. The latter, in turn, can be accomplished by fitting a parametric model of
the fluid flow to the COD images observed in the past. Namely, the learning
phase of the algorithm is composed of the following steps: (i) given a sequence
of COD images, the snapshots of the optical flow are estimated from two
consecutive COD images; (ii) these snapshots are then assimilated into a
Navier-Stokes Equation (NSE), i.e. an initial velocity field for NSE is
selected so that the corresponding NSE' solution is as close as possible to the
optical flow snapshots. The prediction phase consists of utilizing a linear
transport equation, which describes the propagation of COD images in the fluid
flow predicted by NSE, to estimate the future motion of the COD images. The
algorithm has been tested on COD images provided by two geostationary
operational environmental satellites from NOAA serving the west-hemisphere.

derive the theoretical bounds on the privacy of users in such a scenario. We
build on our recent study in the area of location privacy, in which we
introduced formal notions of location privacy for anonymization-based location
privacy-protection mechanisms. Here we derive the fundamental limits of user
privacy when both anonymization and obfuscation-based protection mechanisms are
applied to users' time series of data. We investigate the impact of such
mechanisms on the trade-off between privacy protection and user utility. We
first study achievability results for the case where the time-series of users
are governed by an i.i.d. process. The converse results are proved both for the
i.i.d. case as well as the more general Markov chain model. We demonstrate that
as the number of users in the network grows, the obfuscation-anonymization

perfect privacy; and, in the second region, no user has privacy.

with a short-range pairing interaction, while one component is confined on a
one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice whereas the other is in a homogeneous 3D
continuum. We study the phase diagram and the pseudogap phenomena throughout
the entire BCS-BEC crossover, using a pairing fluctuation theory. We find that
the effective dimensionality of the non-interacting lattice component can
evolve from quasi-3D to quasi-1D, leading to strong Fermi surface mismatch.
Upon pairing, the system becomes effectively quasi-two dimensional in the BEC
regime. The behavior of $T_c$ bears similarity to that of a regular 3D
population imbalanced Fermi gas, but with a more drastic departure from the
regular 3D balanced case, featuring both intermediate temperature superfluidity
and possible pair density wave ground state. Unlike a simple 1D optical lattice
case, $T_c$ in the mixed dimensions has a constant BEC asymptote.

energy of a folded polymer confined to a long cylindrical tube. The polymer is
modeled as a hard-sphere chain. Its conformational free energy $F$ is measured
as a function of $\lambda$, the end-to-end distance of the polymer. In the case
of a flexible linear polymer, $F(\lambda)$ is a linear function in the folded
regime with a gradient that scales as $f\equiv |dF/d\lambda| \sim N^0
D^{-1.20\pm 0.01}$ for a tube of diameter $D$ and a polymer of length $N$. This
is close to the prediction $f \sim N^0 D^{-1}$ obtained from simple scaling
arguments. The discrepancy is due in part to finite-size effects associated
with the de-Gennes blob model. A similar discrepancy was observed for the
folding of a single arm of a three-arm star polymer. We also examine
backfolding of a semiflexible polymer of persistence length $P$ in the classic
Odijk regime. In the overlap regime, the derivative scales $f \sim N^0
D^{-1.72\pm 0.02} P^{-0.35\pm 0.01}$, which is close to the prediction $f \sim
N^0 D^{-5/3} P^{-1/3}$ obtained from a scaling argument that treats
interactions between deflection segments at the second virial level. In
addition, the measured free energy cost of forming a hairpin turn is
quantitatively consistent with a recent theoretical calculation. Finally, we
examine the scaling of $F(\lambda)$ for a confined semiflexible chain in the
presence of an S-loop composed of two hairpins. While the predicted scaling of
the free energy gradient is the same as that for a single hairpin, we observe a
scaling of $f \sim D^{-1.91\pm 0.03} P^{-0.36\pm 0.01}$. Thus, the quantitative
discrepancy between this measurement and the predicted scaling is somewhat
greater for S-loops than for single hairpins.

first-generation ""polluter"" stars, giving rise to the anomalous abundance
patterns. The precise nature of the polluters and their enrichment mechanism
are still unclear. Even so, the chemical abundances measured in
second-generation stars within the globular cluster NGC 2419 provide insight
into this puzzling process. Previous work used Monte Carlo nuclear reaction
network calculations to constrain the temperature-density conditions that could
reproduce the observed abundances, thereby placing robust limits on the origins
of the polluter material. The effect of individual reaction rates on these
conditions has not been studied, however. Thus, we perform an exhaustive

three real-world datasets, namely Delicious, MovieLens, and DBLP, demonstrate

terms of its network structure to reveal organizing principles at the systems
level. Graph representations are versatile models where nodes are associated to
brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections. Structural
graphs model neural pathways in white matter that are the anatomical backbone
between regions. Functional graphs are built based on functional connectivity,
which is a pairwise measure of statistical interdependency between activity
traces of regions. Therefore, most research to date has focused on analyzing
these graphs reflecting structure or function.
  Graph signal processing (GSP) is an emerging area of research where signals
recorded at the nodes of the graph are studied atop the underlying graph
structure. An increasing number of fundamental operations have been generalized
to the graph setting, allowing to analyze the signals from a new viewpoint.
Here, we review GSP for brain imaging data and discuss their potential to
integrate brain structure, contained in the graph itself, with brain function,
residing in the graph signals. We review how brain activity can be meaningfully
filtered based on concepts of spectral modes derived from brain structure. We
also derive other operations such as surrogate data generation or
decompositions informed by cognitive systems. In sum, GSP offers a novel

the lunar surface allows for direct communication between the DSG and surface

constraints for telerobotics must be fully explored on Earth before being
utilized on space exploration missions. We identified two constraints on space
exploration using low-latency surface telerobotics and attempts to quantify
these constraints. A constraint associated with low-latency surface
telerobotics is the bandwidth available between the orbiting command station
and the ground assets. The bandwidth available will vary during operation. As a
result, it is critical to quantify the operational video conditions required
for effective exploration. We designed an experiment to quantify the threshold
frame rate required for effective exploration. The experiment simulated
geological exploration via low-latency surface telerobotics using a COTS rover
in a lunar analog environment. The results from this experiment indicate that
humans should operate above a threshold frame rate of 5 frames per second. In a
separate, but similar experiment, we introduced a 2.6 second delay in the video
system. This delay recreated the latency conditions present when operating
rovers on the lunar farside from an Earth-based command station. This time
delay was compared to low-latency conditions for teleoperation at the DSG

exploration time when the latency is increased to 2.6 seconds. This indicates
that such a delay significantly complicates real-time exploration strategies.

combination of a plane wave and two spherical waves generated by the centers of
atomic spheres. This wave function obeys the Huygens-Fresnel principle
according to which the electron wave scattering by a system of two centers is
accompanied by generation of two spherical waves; their interaction creates a
diffraction pattern far from the target. Each of the Huygens waves, in turn, is
a superposition of the partial spherical waves with different orbital angular
momenta l and their projections m. The amplitudes of these partial waves are
defined by the corresponding phases of electron elastic scattering by an
isolated atomic potential. In numerical calculations the s- and p-phase shifts
are taken into account. So the number of interfering electron waves is equal to
eight: two of which are the s-type waves and the remaining six waves are of the

closed form (rather than in the form of S-matrix expansion) is reduced to
solving a system of eight inhomogeneous algebraic equations. The differential

experimental artifacts, such as detection efficiencies and angular

peaks do not overlap with any secondary peaks, escape peaks, or environmental

spectroscopy, where intensities depend not only on the detection efficiency,

intensities of the entire spectrum (e.g., primary and secondary transition
peaks, escape peaks, Compton continua, etc.) into a statistical model, where

Bayesian statistical inference. This new method provides an elegant solution to

  sandstorms","6 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solar photovoltaic power generation has achieved grid parity in a number of
countries during the last decade. This revolution has begun in countries where
the solar radiation intensity is not very high. Solar resource maps created by
a number of agencies worldwide indicate that areas of high intensity of solar
radiation suitable solar for power generation are in deserts and semi-arid
zones. These regions are dusty and are subjected to both anthropogenic
pollution and natural sand storms. The impact of these events on the solar
photovoltaic (PV) plant yield is significant. An increase in diffuse component
of solar radiation is accompanied by a naturally occurring sand storm. Often
the solar panels are tilted at an optimal angle and the global tilted radiation
value falling on the panels changes significantly during and after the sand
storms. It is noted that the decrease in the power output of a solar
photovoltaic plant during such events is high enough to warrant further
consideration while forecasting the plant output. Inverter performance during
such sand storms is found to be satisfactory. Integrating dust storm monitoring
with PV power plant yield prediction algorithms is necessary for an improved
operation of PV plants.

applications. In particular, location-based services are important
context-aware services that are more and more used for enforcing security
policies, for supporting indoor room navigation, and for providing personalized
assistance. However, a major problem still remains unaddressed---the lack of
solutions that work across buildings while not using additional infrastructure
and also accounting for privacy and reliability needs. In this paper, a
privacy-preserving, multi-modal, cross-building, collaborative localization
platform is proposed based on Wi-Fi RSSI (existing infrastructure), Cellular
RSSI, sound and light levels, that enables room-level localization as main
application (though sub room level granularity is possible). The privacy is
inherently built into the solution based on onion routing, and
perturbation/randomization techniques, and exploits the idea of weighted
collaboration to increase the reliability as well as to limit the effect of
noisy devices (due to sensor noise/privacy). The proposed solution has been
analyzed in terms of privacy, accuracy, optimum parameters, and other overheads
on location data collected at multiple indoor and outdoor locations using an
Android app.

  Tasks","This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transaction on Computers (TC)
  on Sept-09th-2016",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mixed-criticality models are an emerging paradigm for the design of real-time
systems because of their significantly improved resource efficiency. However,
formal mixed-criticality models have traditionally been characterized by two
impractical assumptions: once \textit{any} high-criticality task overruns,
\textit{all} low-criticality tasks are suspended and \textit{all other}
high-criticality tasks are assumed to exhibit high-criticality behaviors at the
same time. In this paper, we propose a more realistic mixed-criticality model,
called the flexible mixed-criticality (FMC) model, in which these two issues
are addressed in a combined manner. In this new model, only the overrun task
itself is assumed to exhibit high-criticality behavior, while other
high-criticality tasks remain in the same mode as before. The guaranteed
service levels of low-criticality tasks are gracefully degraded with the
overruns of high-criticality tasks. We derive a utilization-based technique to
analyze the schedulability of this new mixed-criticality model under EDF-VD
scheduling. During runtime, the proposed test condition serves an important
criterion for dynamic service level tuning, by means of which the maximum
available execution budget for low-criticality tasks can be directly determined
with minimal overhead while guaranteeing mixed-criticality schedulability.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the FMC scheme compared with
state-of-the-art techniques.
