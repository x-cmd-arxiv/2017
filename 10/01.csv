from images of the object under varying lighting conditions. Motivated by
several recent works that extend photometric stereo to more general objects and
lighting conditions, we study a new robust approach to photometric stereo that
utilizes dictionary learning. Specifically, we propose and analyze two
approaches to adaptive dictionary regularization for the photometric stereo
problem. First, we propose an image preprocessing step that utilizes an
adaptive dictionary learning model to remove noise and other non-idealities
from the image dataset before estimating the normal vectors. We also propose an
alternative model where we directly apply the adaptive dictionary
regularization to the normal vectors themselves during estimation. We study the
practical performance of both methods through extensive simulations, which
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of both methods in the presence of
noise.

  a Side-Channel",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Wrist-wearables such as smartwatches and fitness bands are equipped with a
variety of high-precision sensors that support novel contextual and
activity-based applications. The presence of a diverse set of on-board sensors,
however, also expose an additional attack surface which, if not adequately
protected, could be potentially exploited to leak private user information. In
this paper, we investigate the feasibility of a new attack that takes advantage
of a wrist-wearable's motion sensors to infer input on mechanical devices
typically used to secure physical access, for example, combination locks. We
outline an inference framework that attempts to infer a lock's unlock
combination from the wrist motion captured by a smartwatch's gyroscope sensor,
and uses a probabilistic model to produce a ranked list of likely unlock
combinations. We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation of the proposed
framework by employing unlocking-related motion data collected from human
subject participants in a variety of controlled and realistic settings.
Evaluation results from these experiments demonstrate that motion data from
wrist-wearables can be effectively employed as a side-channel to significantly
reduce the unlock combination search-space of commonly found combination locks,
thus compromising the physical security provided by these locks.

technology for information transmission and processing. Y3Fe5O12(YIG),
exhibiting extremely large magnon diffusion length due to the low magnetic
damping constant, has been intensively investigated for decades. While most of
the previous works focused on the determination of magnon diffusion length by
various techniques, herein we demonstrated how to tune magnon diffusion by
light excitation. We found that the diffusion length of thermal magnons is
strongly dependent on light wavelength when the magnon is generated by exposing
YIG directly to laser beam. The diffusion length, determined by a nonlocal
geometry at room temperature, is ~30 um for the magnons produced by visible
light (400-650 nm), and ~136-156 um for the laser between 808 nm and 980 nm.
The diffusion distance is much longer than the reported value. In addition to
thermal gradient, we found that light illumination affected the electron
configuration of the Fe3+ ion in YIG. Long wavelength laser triggers a high
spin to low spin state transition of the Fe3+ ions in FeO6 octahedron. This in
turn causes a substantial softening of the magnon thus a dramatic increase in
diffusion distance. The present work paves the way towards an efficient tuning
of magnon transport behavior which is crucially important for magnon
spintronics.

is to color the vertices of a graph using the minimum number of colors such
that the coloring is conflict-free. We consider both closed neighborhoods,
where the neighborhood of a vertex includes itself, and open neighborhoods,
where a vertex does not included in its neighborhood. We study the
parameterized complexity of conflict-free closed neighborhood coloring and
conflict-free open neighborhood coloring problems. We show that both problems
are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the cluster vertex
deletion number of the input graph. This generalizes the result of Gargano et
al.(2015) that conflict-free coloring is fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by the vertex cover number. Also, we show that both problems
admit an additive constant approximation algorithm when parameterized by the
distance to threshold graphs.
  We also study the complexity of the problem on special graph classes. We show
that both problems can be solved in polynomial time on cographs. For split
graphs, we give a polynomial time algorithm for closed neighborhood

conflict-free coloring is NP-complete. We show that interval graphs can be

defined in [FMZ1]. Every such moduli space is characterized by a second
homology class, genus, and contact data. For certain almost complex structures,
we show that the moduli space of stable log J-holomorphic curves of any fixed
type is compact and metrizable with respect to an enhancement of the Gromov
topology. In the case of smooth symplectic divisors, our compactification is
often smaller than the relative compactification and there is a projection map
from the latter onto the former. The latter is constructed via expanded
degenerations of the target. Our construction does not need any modification of
(or any extra structure on) the target. Unlike the classical moduli spaces of
stable maps, these log moduli spaces are often virtually singular. We describe
an explicit toric model for the normal cone (i.e. the space of gluing
parameters) to each stratum in terms of the defining combinatorial data of that
stratum. In [FT2], we introduce a natural set up for studying the deformation
theory of log (and relative) curves and obtain a logarithmic analog of the
space of Ruan-Tian perturbations for these moduli spaces. In a forthcoming
paper, we will prove a gluing theorem for smoothing log curves in the normal
direction to each stratum. With some modifications to the theory of Kuranishi
spaces, the latter will allow us to construct a virtual fundamental class for
every such log moduli space and define relative GW invariants without any
restriction.

of homomorphisms to a fixed relational structure. For example, the number of
3-colorings of an undirected graph $G$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms
from $G$ to the $3$-clique. In this setup, the structure receiving the
homomorphisms is often referred to as a template; we use the term template
function to refer to a function, from structures to natural numbers, that is
definable as the number of homomorphisms to a fixed template. There is a
literature that studies the complexity of template functions.
  The present work is concerned with relating template functions to the
problems of counting, with respect to various fixed templates, the number of
two particular types of homomorphisms: surjective homomorphisms and what we
term condensations.
  In this article, we explain how any problem of counting surjective
homomorphisms to a fixed template is polynomial-time equivalent to computing a
linear combination of template functions; we also show this for any problem of
counting condensations to a fixed template. Via a theorem that characterizes
the complexity of computing such a linear combination, we show how a known
dichotomy for template functions can be used to infer a dichotomy for counting
surjective homomorphisms on fixed templates, and likewise a dichotomy for
counting condensations on fixed templates. Our study is strongly inspired by,
based on, and can be viewed as a dual of the graph motif framework of
Curticapean, Dell, and Marx (STOC 2017); that framework is in turn based on
work of Lov\'asz (2012).

charge-carrier recombination, which could be suppressed by the built-in
electric field in polar materials. In this study, we investigate the
spontaneous polarization in epitaxially strained LaTiO\textsubscript{2}N thin
films via density functional theory calculations. The effect of epitaxial
strain on the anion order, resulting out-of-plane polarization, energy barriers
for polarization reversal and the corresponding coercive fields are studied. We
find that for compressive strains larger than 4\% the thermodynamically stable
anion order is polar along the out-of-plane direction and has a coercive field
comparable to other switchable ferroelectrics. Our results show that strained
LaTiO\textsubscript{2}N could indeed suppress carrier recombination and lead to
enhanced photocatalytic activities.

computation of the robot motions while allowing possible interactions with
(some of) the obstacles in the environment. Kinodynamic motion planners
equipped with a dynamic engine acting as state propagator are usually used for
that purpose. The difficulties arise in the setting of the adequate forces for
the interactions and because these interactions may change the pose of the
manipulatable obstacles, thus either facilitating or preventing the finding of
a solution path. The use of knowledge can alleviate the stated difficulties.
This paper proposes the use of an enhanced state propagator composed of a
dynamic engine and a low-level geometric reasoning process that is used to
determine how to interact with the objects, i.e. from where and with which
forces. The proposal, called \k{appa}-PMP can be used with any kinodynamic
planner, thus giving rise to e.g. \k{appa}-RRT. The approach also includes a
preprocessing step that infers from a semantic abstract knowledge described in
terms of an ontology the manipulation knowledge required by the reasoning
process. The proposed approach has been validated with several examples
involving an holonomic mobile robot, a robot with differential constraints and
a serial manipulator, and benchmarked using several state-of-the art
kinodynamic planners. The results showed a significant difference in the power
consumption with respect to simple physics-based planning, an improvement in
the success rate and in the quality of the solution paths.

mathematical analysis, the role of structural viscoelasticity in the
biomechanical response of deformable porous media with incompressible
constituents to sudden changes in external applied loads. Models of deformable
porous media with incompressible constituents are often utilized to describe
the behavior of biological tissues, such as cartilages, bones and engineered
tissue scaffolds, where viscoelastic properties may change with age, disease or
by design. Here, for the first time, we show that the fluid velocity within the
medium could increase tremendously, even up to infinity, should the external
applied load experience sudden changes in time and the structural
viscoelasticity be too small. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional
poro-visco-elastic model for which we derive explicit solutions in the cases
where the external applied load is characterized by a step pulse or a
trapezoidal pulse in time. By means of dimensional analysis, we identify some
dimensionless parameters that can aid the design of structural properties
and/or experimental conditions as to ensure that the fluid velocity within the
medium remains bounded below a certain given threshold, thereby preventing
potential tissue damage. The application to confined compression tests for
biological tissues is discussed in detail. Interestingly, the loss of
viscoelastic tissue properties has been associated with various disease
conditions, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Thus,
the findings of this work may be relevant to many applications in biology and
medicine.

modes, giving special attention to the partial restoration of spin-isospin
SU(4) symmetry. To implement this restoration and to fix the model parameters,
we resort to the energetics of Gamow-Teller resonances and to the minima of the
single $\beta^+$-decay strengths. This makes the theory predictive regarding
the $\beta\beta_{2\nu}$-decay, producing the $2\nu$ moments in $^{48}$Ca,
$^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{128,130}$Te, and $^{150}$Nd,
that are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental ones; however, the
agreement with $\beta\beta_{2\nu}$ data is only modest. To include
contributions coming from induced nuclear weak currents, we extend the
$\beta\beta_{0\nu}$-decay formalism employed previously in C. Barbero et. al,
Nuc. Phys. A628, 170 (1998). The numerical results for the $\beta\beta_{0\nu}$
moments in the above mentioned nuclei are similar to those obtained in other
theoretical studies although smaller on averag by $\sim 40\%$. We attribute
this difference basically to the one-QRPA-method, employed here for the first
time, instead of the currently used two-QRPA-method. The difference is
partially due to the way of carrying out the restoration of the spin-isospin
symmetry. It is hard to say which is the best way to make the restoration,
since the $\beta\beta_{0\nu}$ moments are not experimentally measurable. The
numerical uncertainties in the $\beta\beta$ moments, related with i) their
strong dependence on the residual interaction in the p-p channel when evaluated
within the QRPA, and ii) lack of proper knowledge of single-particle energies,
have been quantified. It is concluded that the partial restoration of the SU
(4) symmetry is crucial in the description of the $\beta\beta$-decays,
regardless of the nuclear model used.

binding force and the role of symmetry breaking has not been investigated in
detail in literature. As both bonding and anti-bonding modes are present in the
visible spectra of well-known spherical plasmonic heterodimer sets, binding
force reversal is commonly believed to occur for all such heterodimers. But our
work suggests a very different proposal. We demonstrate that for the symmetry
broken heterodimer configurations: reversal of lateral (for on-axis
heterodimers) and longitudinal (for off-axis heterodimers: end-fire and nearly
end-fire configurations) near field binding force follow fully distinct
mechanisms; i.e. later one on relative orientation and constructive
dipole-quadrupole resonance but the former one on light polarization and the
induced electric resonance. Interestingly, the reversal of longitudinal near
field binding force can be easily controlled just by changing the direction of
light propagation or just their relative orientation. Though it is commonly
believed that plasmonic forces mostly arise from the surface force and Fano
resonance can be a promising way to achieve binding force reversal; our study
based on Lorentz force dynamics suggests notably opposite proposals (for both
instances) for the case of plasmonic spherical heterodimers. Observations of
this article can be very useful for improved sensors, particle clustering and

Effective management of constrained resources and application isolation without

confirmed, this kind of association will be a landmark in multi-messenger

of mega-parsecs. Since normal SGRBs rarely fall into such a close range, to
make it more observationally valuable, we have to focus on low-luminosity SGRBs
which have a higher statistical occurrence rate and detection probability.
However, there is a possibility that an observed low-luminosity SGRB is
intrinsically powerful but we are off-axis and only observe its side emission.
In this paper, we provide some theoretical predictions of both the off-axis
afterglow emission from a nearby SGRB under the assumption of a structured jet
and the macronova signal from the ejecta of this GW-detectable BNS merger. From
the properties of the afterglow emission, we could distinguish an off-axis
normal SGRB from an intrinsically low-energy quasi-isotropic class.
Furthermore, with follow-up multi-wavelength observations, a few parameters for
BNS mergers (e.g. the medium density and the ejecta mass and velocity) would be
constrained.

the problem of image dehazing. Previous methods in image dehazing use a
two-stage approach which first estimate the transmission map followed by clear
image estimation. The drawback of a two-stage method is that it tends to boost
local image artifacts such as noise, aliasing and blocking. This is especially
the case for heavy haze images captured with a low quality device. Our method
is based on convolutional neural networks. Unique in our method is the bilinear
composition loss function which directly model the correlations between
transmission map, clear image, and atmospheric light. This allows errors to be
back-propagated to each sub-network concurrently, while maintaining the
composition constraint to avoid overfitting of each sub-network. We evaluate
the effectiveness of our proposed method using both synthetic and real world
examples. Extensive experiments show that our method outperfoms
state-of-the-art methods especially for haze images with severe noise level and

for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against different
types of attacks. With the increasingly integrated properties of cyber-physical
systems (CPS) today, security is a challenge for critical infrastructures.
Though resilient control and detecting techniques for a specific model of
attack have been proposed, to analyze and design detection and defense
mechanisms against multiple types of attacks for CPSs requires new system
frameworks. Besides security, other requirements such as optimal control cost
also need to be considered. The hybrid game model we propose in this work
contains physical states that are described by the system dynamics, and a cyber
state that represents the detection mode of the system composed by a set of
subsystems. A strategy means selecting a subsystem by combining one controller,
one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at
each state. Based on the game model, we propose a suboptimal value iteration
algorithm for a finite horizon game, and prove that the algorithm results an
upper bound for the value of the finite horizon game. A moving-horizon approach
is also developed in order to provide a scalable and real-time computation of
the switching strategies. Both algorithms aims at obtaining a saddle-point
equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control
cost. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we
compare the results with previously system designs that only equipped with one
type of controller.

nanowires is established via a dimensional crossover from a fluctuating 1D
regime to a phase-coherent 3D ground state. If a homogeneous crystalline
superconductor exhibits sufficiently high uniaxial anisotropy, a similar
1D$\rightarrow$3D crossover has been predicted to occur, provided that
single-particle hopping transverse to the 1D axis is absent in the normal
state. Here we present magnetic penetration depth and electrical transport data
in single crystals of q1D Tl$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$, which reveal a 1D$\rightarrow$3D
superconducting dimensional crossover. Both experimental techniques uncover
multiple energy scales within the superconducting transition, which describe a
sequence of fluctuating regimes. As the temperature is reduced below
$T_{ons}=$~6.7~K, 1D pairing fluctuations are replaced by 1D phase slips below
$T_p\sim$~5.9~K. These give way to 3D phase fluctuations below $T_{ab}=$~4.9~K,
prior to dimensional crossover at $T_{x2}\sim$~4.4~K. The electrical
resistivity below $T_{ab}$ is quantitatively consistent with the establishment
of phase coherence through gradual binding of Josephson vortex strings to form
3D loops. An anomalously low superfluid density persist down to $\sim$3~K
before rising steeply --- in agreement with a theoretical model for crossovers
in q1D superconductors, and suggesting that a small population of unbound,
weakly-pinned vortices survives below the crossover. The observation of a
dimensional crossover within the superconducting state has important
consequences for the low-temperature normal state in Tl$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ and
similar q1D metals, which may exhibit one-dimensional behavior over far greater
temperature ranges than band structure calculations suggest.

critical performance metric in a wide range of applications such as data file
retrieval in coded storage systems and parallel computing. In this problem,
each job is completed only when all of its tasks are completed, so the delay of
a job is the maximum of the delays of its tasks. Despite the wide attention
this problem has received, tight analysis is still largely unknown since
analyzing job delay requires characterizing the complicated correlation among
task delays, which is hard to do.
  We first consider an asymptotic regime where the number of servers, $n$, goes
to infinity, and the number of tasks in a job, $k^{(n)}$, is allowed to
increase with $n$. We establish the asymptotic independence of any $k^{(n)}$
queues under the condition $k^{(n)} = o(n^{1/4})$. This greatly generalizes the
asymptotic-independence type of results in the literature where asymptotic
independence is shown only for a fixed constant number of queues. As a
consequence of our independence result, the job delay converges to the maximum
of independent task delays.
  We next consider the non-asymptotic regime. Here we prove that independence
yields a stochastic upper bound on job delay for any $n$ and any $k^{(n)}$ with
$k^{(n)}\le n$. The key component of our proof is a new technique we develop,
called ""Poisson oversampling"". Our approach converts the job delay problem into
a corresponding balls-and-bins problem. However, in contrast with typical
balls-and-bins problems where there is a negative correlation among bins, we
prove that our variant exhibits positive correlation.

smooth velocity fields, which specify a desired velocity as a function of time
and position in a decentralized manner i.e., each agent calculates the desired
velocity locally by utilizing the number of agents within a prescribed
communication distance. Swarm converges to the desired/commanded density
distribution by following the velocity field. The local information consists,
only, of agents' positions and it is utilized to estimate the density around
each agent. Local density estimation is performed by using kernel density
estimation. Then the local density estimates and the desired density are
utilized to generate the velocity field, which propagates the swarm probability
density distribution via the well-known heat equation. The key advantage of
using smooth velocity fields to control swarm density with respect to our
earlier Markov chain based probabilistic control methods is that the agents
move more smoothly in an organized manner and their relative velocities go to
zero as they get closer to each other, i.e., they facilitate conflict/collision
avoidance. The desired density distribution, which is commanded to the local
controllers, can be computed by using a Markov chain that propagates the
desired density distribution within prescribed requirements. Along with
convergence and stability analysis, the effectiveness of the approach is
illustrated via numerical examples.

'remarkable formula' introduced by Ford et. al. 1985. For instance, we obtain a
nonperturbative representation for the atom-atom and atom-wall interactions. We
investigate several limiting cases. From the limit $T\to0$ we show that the
third law of thermodynamics cannot be violated within the given approach, where
the dissipation parameter cannot depend on temperature 'by construction'. We
conclude, that the given approach is insufficient to resolve the thermodynamic
puzzle connected with the Drude model when inserted into the Lifshitz formula.
Further we consider the transition to Matsubara representation and discuss
modifications of the contribution from the zeroth Matsubara frequency.

way to produce coherent ultrafast extreme-UV (XUV) or soft x-ray light sources.
Here we describe a robust and tunable method for scaling and narrowing the
bandwidth of high-order harmonics in different transversal modes based on
femtosecond dynamic grating in a gas jet. This technique has potential of
self-phase controlled XUV generation by adjusting the intersect angle and the
intensity ratio of interfering fundamental beams. The limitations of using high
intensity laser fundamental pulses in gas, such as non-negligible the magnetic
field which prevents recombination with parent and self-focusing of laser and
plasma creation in the generated harmonics beam path which prevents phase
matching, can be solved by using dynamic grating generated by the fundamental
pulse and/or its harmonic with small intersect angle. The grating pattern
introduces a phase modulation in the dipole emission imprint such pattern in
the gas medium. As the spatial and temporal behaviors of the grating are
closely connected in harmonic generation, by shaping of the spatial profile of
the interfering beams it is possible to create a more complex tunable beating
pattern as harmonic sources to transfer desired optical information to XUV
pulses. In this case, the phase mismatch can be completely compensate by tuning
the gas pressure, adjusting the intersect angle as well as intensity ratio of
the interfering beams to produce a bright XUV with desired transversal mode.

seen from supermassive black holes (BHs) accreting via a radiatively efficient
thin disc. Their high energy emission is well modelled by highly relativistic
electrons in the jet Compton upscattering an external source of seed photons,
primarily from the broad line region. Strong Doppler boosting by the jet bulk
motion makes these FSRQs readily detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.
We combine jet spectral models with scaling relations for the jet physical
parameters as a function of mass and accretion rate. This does not match well
to the Gamma-ray loud Narrow Line Seyfert 1s, assuming their low BH masses are
reliable, but is able to predict much of the spectral evolution observed along
the Blazar sequence. We use these models in conjunction with cosmological
simulations of efficiently accreting BH number densities, and find that they
overpredict the observed number of FSRQs by 2 orders of magnitude if all of
these objects produce a FSRQ jet. We can better reproduce the observed numbers
if jets are only produced by high spin BHs and BH spin is built from
chaotically aligned accretion episodes so that high spin BHs are rare. However,
this does not reproduce the observed redshift and mass accretion rate
distributions of the FSRQs. This may indicate a redshift dependence in
accretion mode, with sustained alignment accretion episodes being more
prevalent at higher redshift, or that there is some other trigger for FSRQ
jets.

various general statements about Heisenberg-Zeeman systems that will be proven
under most general assumptions. One topic is the connection between the minimal
energy functions $E_{min}$ for the Heisenberg energy and $H_{min}$ for the
Heisenberg-Zeeman energy which turn out to be essentially mutual
Legendre-Fenchel transforms. This generalization of the traditional Legendre
transform is especially suited to cope with situations where the function
$E_{min}$ is not convex and consequently there is a magnetization jump at a
critical field. Another topic is magnetization and the occurrence of threshold
fields $B_{thr}$ and saturation fields $B_{sat}$, where we provide a general
formula for the latter. We suggest a distinction between ferromagnetic and
anti-ferromagnetic systems based on the vanishing of $B_{sat}$ for the former
ones. Parabolic systems are defined in such a way that $E_{min}$ and $H_{min}$
have a particularly simple form and studied in detail. For a large class of
parabolic systems the relative ground states can be constructed from the
absolute ground state by means of a so-called umbrella family. Finally we
provide a counter-example of a parabolic system where this construction is not
possible.

the Standard Model sector via a Higgs portal. If the portal coupling is small
enough the VDM can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. It turns out that
the electroweak phase transition have a substantial impact on the prediction of
the VDM relic density. We further assume that the dark Higgs boson which gives
the VDM mass is so light that it can induce strong VDM self-interactions and
solve the small-scale structure problems of the Universe. As illustrated by the
latest LUX data, the extreme smallness of the Higgs portal coupling required by
the freeze-in mechanism implies that the dark matter direct detection bounds
are easily satisfied. However, the model is well constrained by the indirect
detections of VDM from BBN, CMB, AMS-02, and diffuse $\gamma$/X-rays.
Consequently, only when the dark Higgs boson mass is at most of ${\cal O}({\rm

relic abundance and an appropriate VDM self-scattering while satisfying all
other constraints simultaneously.

universal process of key importance to habitability and exoplanet biosignature
detection. Here we take a generalized approach to this phenomenon. Using a
single parameter to describe redox state, we model the evolution of terrestrial
planets around nearby M-stars and the Sun. Our model includes atmospheric
photochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations and
interior thermodynamics and chemistry. In most cases we find abiotic
atmospheric O2 buildup around M-stars during the pre-main sequence phase to be
much less than calculated previously, because the planet's magma ocean absorbs
most oxygen liberated from H2O photolysis. However, loss of non-condensing
atmospheric gases after the mantle solidifies remains a significant potential
route to abiotic atmospheric O2 subsequently. In all cases, we predict that
exoplanets that receive lower stellar fluxes, such as LHS1140b and TRAPPIST-1f

most interesting targets for future searches for biogenic O2. Key remaining
uncertainties can be minimized in future by comparing our predictions for the

coupling to a circadian clock and those without known coupling to a circadian
clock. Correlations between cell cycles duration in discrete lineages observed
in the organisms with a circadian clock cannot be explained by a simple
statistical model but are consistent with predictions of a biologically
plausible two dimensional nonlinear map. Surprisingly, the nonlinear map is
equivalent to a classic nonlinear map called the fattened Arnold map. The model
predicts that circadian coupling may increase cell to cell variability in a
clonal population of cells. In agreement with this prediction, deletion of the

can identify systems under periodic forcing and that studies of nonlinear

known to influence the speed of evolution towards a specific genetic

where the distribution of resources follows seasonal cycles, both analytically
and experimentally by means of an agent-based model of a foraging task.
Individuals can either specialize to foraging only one specific resource type
or generalize to foraging all resource types at a low success rate. It is found
that the introduction of learning, one instance of phenotypic plasticity,
changes what genetic configuration evolves. Specifically, the genome of
learning agents evolves a predisposition to adapt quickly to changes in the
resource distribution, under the same conditions for which non-learners would
evolve a predisposition to maximize the foraging efficiency for a specific
resource type. This paper expands the literature at the interface between
Biology and Machine Learning by identifying the Baldwin effects in
cyclically-changing environments and demonstrating that learning can change the

scaling of the total optical conductance with $L$ differs between the two

diffusion scenarios often diverge from their more well-studied counterparts on

describes information diffusion on physical networks from a multi-agent team

cascade and threshold models of influence spread: 1) The structural composition
of a seed set team impacts each individual node's influencing behavior, and 2)
an influencing node may spread information to non-neighbors. We show that the
AJM significantly outperforms existing models in its fit to the observed
node-level influence data on the youth networks. We then prove theoretical
results, showing that the AJM exhibits many well-behaved properties shared by
dominant models. Our results suggest that the AJM presents a flexible and more
accurate model of network diffusion that may better inform influence
maximization in the field.

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
instruments in recent years, but there is little reference data on sputter
yields in the literature as yet. Total sputter yield reference data is needed
in order to plan, and later calibrate the depth scale, of XPS or SIMS depth
profiles. We previously published a semi-empirical Threshold equation for
estimating cluster total sputter yield from the energy-per-atom of the cluster
and the effective monatomic sputter threshold of the material. This has already
been shown to agree extremely well with sputter yield measurements on a range
of organic and inorganic materials for clusters of around a thousand atoms.
Here we use the molecular dynamics (MD) approach to explore a wider range of
energy and cluster size than is easy to do experimentally to high precision. We
have performed MD simulations using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively
Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) parallel MD code on high-performance computer (HPC)
systems at Cincinnati and Newcastle. We performed 1,150 simulations of
individual collisions with a silicon (100) surface as an archetypal inorganic
substrate, for cluster sizes between 30 and 3,000 argon atoms and energies in
the range 5 to 40eV per atom. This corresponds to the most important regime for
experimental cluster depth-profiling in SIMS and XPS. Our MD results show a
dependence on cluster size as well as energy-per-atom. Using the exponent
previously suggested by Paruch et al, we modified the Threshold model equation
published previously to take this into account. The modified Threshold equation
fits all our MD results extremely well, building on its success in fitting
experimental sputter yield measurements.

in each basic-level category. Existing methods employ discriminative
localization to find the key distinctions among subcategories. However, they
generally have two limitations: (1) Discriminative localization relies on
region proposal methods to hypothesize the locations of discriminative regions,
which are time-consuming. (2) The training of discriminative localization
depends on object or part annotations, which are heavily labor-consuming. It is
highly challenging to address the two key limitations simultaneously, and
existing methods only focus on one of them. Therefore, we propose a weakly
supervised discriminative localization approach (WSDL) for fast fine-grained
image classification to address the two limitations at the same time, and its
main advantages are: (1) n-pathway end-to-end discriminative localization
network is designed to improve classification speed, which simultaneously
localizes multiple different discriminative regions for one image to boost
classification accuracy, and shares full-image convolutional features generated
by region proposal network to accelerate the process of generating region
proposals as well as reduce the computation of convolutional operation. (2)
Multi-level attention guided localization learning is proposed to localize
discriminative regions with different focuses automatically, without using
object and part annotations, avoiding the labor consumption. Different level
attentions focus on different characteristics of the image, which are
complementary and boost the classification accuracy. Both are jointly employed
to simultaneously improve classification speed and eliminate dependence on
object and part annotations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods on 2
widely-used fine-grained image classification datasets, our WSDL approach
achieves the best performance.

  arXiv:1710.00246",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper aims to investigate the numerical approximation of a general
second order parabolic stochastic partial differential equation(SPDE) driven by
multiplicative and additive noise under more relaxed conditions. The SPDE is
discretized in space by the finite element method and in time by the linear
implicit Euler method. This extends the current results in the literature to
not necessary self-adjoint operator with more general boundary conditions. As a
consequence key part of the proof does not rely on the spectral decomposition
of the linear operator. We achieve optimal convergence orders which depend on
the regularity of the noise and the initial data. In particular, for
multiplicative noise we achieve optimal order $\mathcal{O}(h^2+\Delta t^{1/2})$
and for additive noise, we achieve optimal order $\mathcal{O}(h^2+\Delta t)$.
In contrast to current work in the literature, where the optimal convergence
orders are achieved for additive noise by incorporating further regularity
assumptions on the nonlinear drift function, our optimal convergence orders are
obtained under only the standard Lipschitz condition of the nonlinear drift
term. Numerical experiments to sustain our theoretical results are provided.

  Agent-based Computing Approach","14 pages, 23 figures",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A smart grid can be considered as a complex network where each node
represents a generation unit or a consumer. Whereas links can be used to
represent transmission lines. One way to study complex systems is by using the
agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm. An ABM is a way of representing a complex
system of autonomous agents interacting with each other. Previously, a number
of studies have been presented in the smart grid domain making use of the ABM
paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have
focused on the specification aspect of ABM. An ABM specification is important
not only for understanding but also for replication of the model. In this
study, we focus on development as well as specification of ABM for smart grid.
We propose an ABM by using a combination of agent-based and complex
network-based approaches. For ABM specification, we use ODD and DREAM
specification approaches. We analyze these two specification approaches
qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DREAM is a most useful approach as compared with ODD for modeling as well as
for replication of models for smart grid.

out of equilibrium evolutions. This could be potentially relevant for particle
data obtained from experimental applications. The key idea underlying the
method is that finite, yet large, particle systems formally obey stochastic
partial differential equations of gradient flow type satisfying a
fluctuation-dissipation relation. The strategy is here applied to three classic
particle models, namely independent random walkers, a zero range process and a
symmetric simple exclusion process in one space dimension, to allow the
comparison with analytic solutions.

the three negative parameters are induced by dipolar, monopolar and quadrupolar
resonance respectively. The dipolar and monopolar resonances result into the
negative band for longitudinal waves, while the dipolar and quadrupolar
resonances cause the negative band for transverse waves. The two bands have an
overlapping frequency regime. A simultaneously negative refraction for both

optimal decoding order as a function of the channel state information at the CU

performance of the proposed NOMA scheme in terms of the outage probability over
Gamma-Gamma FSO turbulence channels. We further derive closed-form expressions
for the outage probability for the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Our
simulation results confirm the analytical derivations and reveal that the
