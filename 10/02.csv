walk $Z(t)$ on the graph's nodes, which jumps along the graph's edges with jump
rates given by the edge weights. We show that the scaled process $\varepsilon^2
Z(t/\varepsilon^2)$ converges to a linear drift $\bar{U}t$ and the case of
interest to us is that of null drift $\bar{U}=0$. In this case, we show that
$\varepsilon Z(t/\varepsilon^2)$ converges weakly to a Brownian motion. The
diffusivity of the limiting Brownian motion can be computed by solving a set of
linear algebra problems. As we allow for jump rates to be irreversible, our
framework allows for the modeling of very general forms of interactions such as
attraction, repulsion, and bonding. We provide some sufficient conditions for
null drift that include certain symmetries of the graph. We also provide a
formal asymptotic derivation of the effective diffusivity in analogy with
homogenization theory for PDEs. For the case of reversible jump rates, we
derive an equivalent variational formulation. This derivation involves
developing notions of gradient for functions on the graph's nodes, divergence
for ${\mathbb R}^d$-valued functions on the graph's edges, and a divergence

increasing x-coordinates.
  Terrain Guarding can be seen as a special case of the famous art gallery
problem where one has to place at most $k$ guards on a terrain made of $n$
vertices in order to fully see it.
  In 2010, King and Krohn showed that Terrain Guarding is NP-complete [SODA
'10, SIAM J. Comput. '11] thereby solving a long-standing open question.
  They observe that their proof does not settle the complexity of Orthogonal
Terrain Guarding where the terrain only consists of horizontal or vertical
segments; those terrains are called rectilinear or orthogonal.
  Recently, Ashok et al. [SoCG'17] presented an FPT algorithm running in time
$k^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ for Dominating Set in the visibility graphs of rectilinear
terrains without 180-degree vertices.
  They ask if Orthogonal Terrain Guarding is in P or NP-hard.
  In the same paper, they give a subexponential-time algorithm running in
$n^{O(\sqrt n)}$ (actually even $n^{O(\sqrt k)}$) for the general Terrain
Guarding and notice that the hardness proof of King and Krohn only disproves a
running time $2^{o(n^{1/4})}$ under the ETH.
  Hence, there is a significant gap between their $2^{O(n^{1/2} \log
n)}$-algorithm and the no $2^{o(n^{1/4})}$ ETH-hardness implied by King and
Krohn's result.
  In this paper, we adapt the gadgets of King and Krohn to rectilinear terrains
in order to prove that even Orthogonal Terrain Guarding is NP-complete.
  Then, we show how to obtain an improved ETH lower bound of
$2^{\Omega(n^{1/3})}$ by refining the quadratic reduction from Planar 3-SAT
into a cubic reduction from 3-SAT.
  This works for both Orthogonal Terrain Guarding and Terrain Guarding.

matrix factorization problem under a separability assumption. Even if noise is
added to the problem, SPA is robust as long as the perturbations caused by the
noise are small. In particular, robustness against noise should be high when
handling the problems arising from real applications. The preconditioner
proposed by Gillis and Vavasis (2015) makes it possible to enhance the noise
robustness of SPA. Meanwhile, an additional computational cost is required. The
construction of the preconditioner contains a step to compute the top-$k$
truncated singular value decomposition of an input matrix. It is known that the
decomposition provides the best rank-$k$ approximation to the input matrix; in
other words, a matrix with the smallest approximation error among all matrices
of rank less than $k$. This step is an obstacle to an efficient implementation
of the preconditioned SPA.
  To address the cost issue, we propose a modification of the algorithm for
constructing the preconditioner. Although the original algorithm uses the best
rank-$k$ approximation, instead of it, our modification uses an alternative.
Ideally, this alternative should have high approximation accuracy and low
computational cost. To ensure this, our modification employs a rank-$k$
approximation produced by an SPA based algorithm. We analyze the accuracy of
the approximation and evaluate the computational cost of the algorithm. We then
present an empirical study revealing the actual performance of the SPA based
rank-$k$ approximation algorithm and the modified preconditioned SPA.

block codes can potentially reduce the resource overhead to a great extent. A
major obstacle is the requirement of a large number of clean ancilla states of
different types without correlated errors inside each block. These ancilla
states are usually logical stabilizer states of the data code blocks, which are
generally difficult to prepare if the code size is large. Previously we have
proposed an ancilla distillation protocol for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)
codes by classical error-correcting codes. It was assumed that the quantum
gates in the distillation circuit were perfect; however, in reality, noisy
quantum gates may introduce correlated errors that are not treatable by the
protocol. In this paper, we show that additional postselection by another
classical error-detecting code can be applied to remove almost all correlated
errors. Consequently, the revised protocol is fully fault-tolerant and capable
of preparing a large set of stabilizer states sufficient for FTQC using large
block codes. At the same time, the yield rate can be boosted from $O(t^{-2})$
to $O(1)$ in practice for an $[[n,k,d=2t+1]]$ CSS code. Ancilla preparation for
the $[[23,1,7]]$ quantum Golay code is numerically studied in detail through
Monte Carlo simulation. The results support the validity of the protocol when
the gate failure rate is reasonably low. To the best of our knowledge, this
approach is the first attempt to prepare general large block stabilizer states
free of correlated errors for FTQC in a fault-tolerant and efficient manner.

and malicious insiders, but requires the cloud to compute on encrypted data.
Trusted (hardware) modules, e.g., secure enclaves like Intel's SGX, can very
efficiently run entire programs in encrypted memory. However, it already has
been demonstrated that software vulnerabilities give an attacker ample
opportunity to insert arbitrary code into the program. This code can then
modify the data flow of the program and leak any secret in the program to an
observer in the cloud via SGX side-channels. Since any larger program is rife
with software vulnerabilities, it is not a good idea to outsource entire
programs to an SGX enclave. A secure alternative with a small trusted code base
would be fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) -- the holy grail of encrypted
computation. However, due to its high computational complexity it is unlikely
to be adopted in the near future. As a result researchers have made several
proposals for transforming programs to perform encrypted computations on less
powerful encryption schemes. Yet, current approaches fail on programs that make
control-flow decisions based on encrypted data. In this paper, we introduce the
concept of data flow authentication (DFAuth). DFAuth prevents an adversary from
arbitrarily deviating from the data flow of a program. Hence, an attacker
cannot perform an attack as outlined before on SGX. This enables that all
programs, even those including operations on control-flow decision variables,
can be computed on encrypted data. We implemented DFAuth using a novel
authenticated homomorphic encryption scheme, a Java bytecode-to-bytecode
compiler producing fully executable programs, and SGX enclaves. A transformed
neural network that performs machine learning on sensitive medical data can be
evaluated on encrypted inputs and encrypted weights in 0.86 seconds.

networks, where a large number of single-antenna access points (APs) are
distributed over the coverage area. There are no cells but all users are
jointly served by the APs using network MIMO methods. Prior works have claimed
that CF Massive MIMO inherits the basic properties of cellular Massive MIMO,
namely channel hardening and favorable propagation. In this paper, we evaluate
if one can rely on these properties when having a realistic stochastic AP
deployment. Our results show that channel hardening only appears in special
cases, for example, when the pathloss exponent is small. However, by using
5--10 antennas per AP, instead of one, we can substantially improve the
hardening. Only spatially well-separated users will exhibit favorable
propagation, but when adding more antennas and/or reducing the pathloss
exponent, it becomes more likely for favorable propagation to occur. The
conclusion is that we cannot rely on channel hardening and favorable
propagation when analyzing and designing CF Massive MIMO networks, but we need
to use achievable rate expressions and resource allocation schemes that work
well also in the absence of these properties. Some options are reviewed in this
paper.

  Framework To Categorize Common Challenges","Presented at the 2015 Conference on Digital Experimentation

experimental design, ensuring experimenters do not have to worry about
sampling, randomisation, subject tracking, data collection, metric definition
and interpretation of results. The recent success and rapid adoption of these
platforms in the industry might in part be attributed to the ease-of-use these
abstractions provide. Previous authors have pointed out there are common
pitfalls to avoid when running controlled experiments on the web and emphasised
the need for experts familiar with the entire software stack to be involved in
the process.
  In this paper, we argue that these pitfalls and the need to understand the
underlying complexity are not the result of shortcomings specific to existing
platforms which might be solved by better platform design. We postulate that
they are a direct consequence of what is commonly referred to as ""the law of
leaky abstractions"". That is, it is an inherent feature of any software
platform that details of its implementation leak to the surface, and that in
certain situations, the platform's consumers necessarily need to understand
details of underlying systems in order to make proficient use of it.
  We present several examples of this concept, including examples from
literature, and suggest some possible mitigation strategies that can be
employed to reduce the impact of abstraction leakage. The conceptual framework
put forward in this paper allows us to explicitly categorize experimentation
pitfalls in terms of which specific abstraction is leaking, thereby aiding
implementers and users of these platforms to better understand and tackle the
challenges they face.

representation. The main difficulty previously encountered on this way is that
the Mellin amplitude for the free theory correlator is ill-defined. To resolve
this problem, instead of literally applying the standard definition, we propose
to define this amplitude by linearity using decompositions, where each term has
the associated Mellin amplitude well-defined. Up to a sign, the resulting
amplitude is equal to the Mellin amplitude for the singular part of the quartic
vertex in the bulk theory and, hence, can be used to analyze bulk locality.
From this analysis we find that the scalar quartic self-interaction vertex in
the holographic higher spin theory has a singularity of a special form, which
can be distinguished from generic bulk exchanges. We briefly discuss the
physical interpretation of such singularities and their relation to the Noether

absorption lines to derive physical properties of absorbers with a formal
treatment of detections, including saturated systems, and non-detections in a
uniform manner. We find that in the lines of sight passing through localized
density structures, absorption lines of low, intermediate and high ions are
present in the spectrum and overlap in velocity space. Low, intermediate and
high ions can be combined to derive the mass-weighted properties of a
density-varying peak, although the ions are not co-spatial within the

exhibit detectable HI and high ions. In such lines of sight, the absorption
lines are typically broad due to the complex velocity fields across the entire
halo. We show that the derived gas density, temperature, and metallicity match
closely the corresponding HI mass-weighted averages along the LOS. We also show
that when the data quality allows, our Bayesian technique allows one to recover
the underlying physical properties of LOS by incorporating both detections and
non-detections. It is especially useful to include non-detections, of species
such as NV or NeVIII, when the number of detections of strong absorbers, such
as HI and OVI, is smaller than the number of model parameters (density,

massive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical

third had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding 3 times the host's stellar
mass, and approximately one-sixth had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding
10 times of the host's stellar mass. These mergers lead to a sharp, but often
temporary, decrease in the D/T of the hosts, implying that discs are usually
disrupted but then quickly re-grow. To do so, high cold gas fractions are
required post-merger, as well as a relatively quiescent recent history (over a
few Gyrs before z=0). Our results show that discs can form via diverse merger
pathways and that quiescent histories are not the dominant mode of disc
formation.

the local minimum principle on the specific entropy. The technique combines a
first-order, invariant domain preserving, Guaranteed Maximum Speed method using
a Graph Viscosity (GMS-GV1) with an invariant domain violating, but entropy
consistent, high-order method. Invariant domain preserving auxiliary states,
naturally produced by the GMS-GV1 method, are used to define local bounds for
the high-order method which is then made invariant domain preserving via a
convex limiting process. Numerical tests confirm the second-order accuracy of
the new GMS-GV2 method in the maximum norm, where 2 stands for second-order.
The proposed convex limiting is generic and can be applied to other

network links. Operators have to make provisions for sudden traffic bursts and
network failures to assure uninterrupted operations. In practice, traffic
averages are used to roughly estimate required capacity. More accurate
solutions often require traffic statistics easily obtained from packet
captures, e.g. variance. Our investigations on real Internet traffic have
emphasized that the traffic shows high variations at small aggregation times,
which indicates that the traffic is self-similar and has a heavy-tailed
characteristics. Self-similarity and heavy-tailedness are of great importance
for network capacity planning purposes. Traffic modeling process should
consider all Internet traffic characteristics. Thereby, the quality of service
(QoS) of the network would not affected by any mismatching between the real
traffic properties and the reference statistical model.
  This paper proposes a new class of traffic profiles that is better suited for
metering bursty Internet traffic streams. We employ bandwidth provisioning to
determine the lowest required bandwidth capacity level for a network link, such
that for a given traffic load, a desired performance target is met. We validate
our approach using packet captures from real IP-based networks.
  The proposed link dimensioning approach starts by measuring the statistical
parameters of the available traces, and then the degree of fluctuations in the
traffic has been measured. This is followed by choosing a proper model to fit
the traffic such as lognormal and generalized extreme value distributions.
Finally, the optimal capacity for the link can be estimated by deploying the
bandwidth provisioning approach. It has been shown that the heavy tailed
distributions give more precise values for the link capacity than the Gaussian
model.

significance of $5.18\sigma$. The amplitude of the cross-power spectrum is low
relative to the expected dark matter power spectrum, assuming a neutral

scales. At $k\sim1.5$ $ h \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$, the cross power spectrum is more
than a factor of 6 lower than expected, with a significance of $14.8\,\sigma$.
This decrement indicates either a lack of clustering of neutral hydrogen (HI),
a small correlation coefficient between optical galaxies and HI, or some
combination of the two. Separating 2dF into red and blue galaxies, we find that
red galaxies are much more weakly correlated with HI on $k\sim1.5$ $h

(nucleotides) had to form and polymerize in favourable environments on the
early Earth. At this time, meteorites and interplanetary dust particles
delivered organics such as nucleobases (the characteristic molecules of
nucleotides) to warm little ponds whose wet-dry cycles promoted rapid
polymerization. We build a comprehensive numerical model for the evolution of
nucleobases in warm little ponds leading to the emergence of the first
nucleotides and RNA. We couple Earth's early evolution with complex prebiotic
chemistry in these environments. We find that RNA polymers must have emerged
very quickly after the deposition of meteorites (< a few years). Their
constituent nucleobases were primarily meteoritic in origin and not from
interplanetary dust particles. Ponds appeared as continents rose out of the
early global ocean but this increasing availability of ""targets"" for meteorites
was offset by declining meteorite bombardment rates. Moreover, the rapid losses
of nucleobases to pond seepage during wet periods, and to UV photodissociation
during dry periods means that the synthesis of nucleotides and their
polymerization into RNA occurred in just one to a few wet-dry cycles. Under
these conditions, RNA polymers likely appeared prior to 4.17 billion years ago.
  Significance: There are two competing hypotheses for the site at which an RNA
world emerged: hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean and warm little ponds.
Because the former lacks wet and dry cycles, which are well known to promote
polymerization (in this case, of nucleotides into RNA), we construct a
comprehensive model for the origin of RNA in the latter sites. Our model
advances the story and timeline of the RNA world by constraining the source of
biomolecules, the environmental conditions, the timescales of reaction, and the
emergence of first RNA polymers.

letter, the mesonic decay modes $\mathrm{{^3_\Lambda}H \rightarrow ^3He +
\pi^-}$ and $\mathrm{{^3_\Lambda}H \rightarrow d + p + \pi^-}$ are used to
reconstruct the hypertriton from Au+Au collision data collected by the STAR
collaboration at RHIC. A minimum $\chi^2$ estimation is used to determine the
lifetime of $\tau = 142^{+24}_{-21}\,{\rm (stat.)} {\pm} 31\,{\rm (syst.)}$ ps.
This lifetime is about 50\% shorter than the lifetime $\tau = 263\pm2$ ps of a
free $\Lambda$, indicating strong hyperon-nucleon interaction in the
hypernucleus system. The branching ratios of the mesonic decay channels are
also determined to satisfy B.R.$_{(^3{\rm He}+\pi^-)}/$(B.R.$_{(^3{\rm

$J(\mathrm{^{3}_{\Lambda}H})$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ over
$J(\mathrm{^{3}_{\Lambda}H})$ = $\frac{3}{2}$. These measurements will help to
constrain models of hyperon-baryon interactions.

guard-regions, and make multi-step ahead predictions on each mode dynamics. We
combine a PWS non-linear model with a particle filter to effectively track
multi-modal transitions. We further use synthetic oversampling techniques to
address the challenge of detecting mode transition which is sparse compared to
mode dynamics. This work provides an effective form of model learning in a
complex hybrid system, which can be useful for future integration in a

have proposed the use of TICs as collective variables for enhanced sampling.
However, it is unclear what the best strategy for estimating the TICs of a

system to describe the slow dynamics of similar systems, we develop a
methodology for measuring the transferability of TICs and apply it to a wide

dynamics of some systems surprisingly well, while failing to transfer between
other sets of systems, highlighting the inherent difficulties of predicting TIC
transferability. Additionally, we use two dimensional Brownian dynamics

basic tools in quantum optics. Although the outcome from existing methods is
believed to be a good approximation when the measured light is sufficiently
weak, there is no rigorous quantitative bounds on the degree of the
approximation. As a result, they fail to fulfill the demand arising from
emerging applications of quantum information such as quantum cryptography.
Here, we propose a calibration method to produce rigorous bounds for a
photon-number probability distribution by using a conventional
Hanbury-Brown-Twiss setup with threshold photon detectors. We present a general
framework to treat any number of detectors and non-uniformity of their
efficiencies. The bounds are conveniently given as closed-form expressions of
the observed coincidence rates and the detector efficiencies. We also show
optimality of the bounds for light with a small mean photon number. As an
application, we show that our calibration method can be used for the light
source in a decoy-state quantum key distribution protocol. It replaces the a
priori assumption on the distribution that has been commonly used, and achieves
almost the same secure key rate when four detectors are used for the
calibration.

the security of databases outsourced to the cloud. These enclaves provide an
execution environment isolated from the hypervisor/OS, and encrypt data in RAM.
However, for applications that use large amounts of memory, including most
databases, enclaves do not protect against access pattern leaks, which let
attackers gain a large amount of information about the data. Moreover,the naive
way to address this issue, using Oblivious RAM (ORAM) primitives from the
security literature, adds substantial overhead.
  A number of recent works explore trusted hardware enclaves as a path toward
secure, access-pattern oblivious outsourcing of data storage and analysis.
While these works efficiently solve specific subproblems (e.g. building secure
indexes or running analytics queries that always scan entire tables), no prior
work has supported oblivious query processing for general query workloads on a
DBMS engine with multiple access methods. Moreover, applying these techniques
individually does not guarantee that an end-to-end workload, such as a complex
SQL query over multiple tables, will be oblivious. In this paper, we introduce
ObliDB, an oblivious database engine design that is the first system to provide
obliviousness for general database read workloads over multiple access methods.
  ObliDB supports a broad range of queries, including aggregation, joins,
insertions, deletions and point queries. We implement ObliDB and show that, on
analytics work-loads, ObliDB ranges from 1.1-19x faster than Opaque,a previous
oblivious, enclave-based system designed only for analytics, and comes within
2.6x of Spark SQL. ObliDB supports point queries with 3-10ms latency, which
runs over 7x faster than HIRB, a previous encryption-based oblivious index
system.

numerically solve the structures of both a protostar and its surrounding

depth of the dust cocoon, a dusty part of the accretion envelope, differs among
the direct light from the stellar photosphere and the diffuse light re-emitted
as dust thermal emission. As a result, varying the metallicity qualitatively
changes the way that the radiative feedback suppresses the accretion flow. With
a fixed accretion rate of $10^{-3}M_{\odot} {\rm yr^{-1}}$, the both direct and
diffuse lights jointly operate to prevent the mass accretion at $Z \gtrsim
10^{-1}Z_{\odot}$. At $Z \lesssim 10^{-1}Z_{\odot}$, the diffuse light is no
longer effective, and the direct light solely limits the mass accretion. At $Z
\lesssim 10^{-3}Z_{\odot}$, the HII region formation plays an important role in
terminating the accretion. The resultant upper mass limit increases with
decreasing metallicity, from a few $\times~10~M_\odot$ to $\sim 10^3~M_\odot$
over $Z = 1Z_{\odot} - 10^{-4}~Z_\odot$. We also illustrate how the radiation
spectrum of massive star-forming cores changes with decreasing metallicity.
First, the peak wavelength of the spectrum, which is located around $30 \mu
{\rm m}$ at $1Z_{\odot}$, shifts to $< 3 \mu {\rm m}$ at $Z \lesssim 0.1
Z_\odot$. Second, a characteristic feature at $10 \mu \rm{m}$ due to the
amorphous silicate band appears as a dip at $1Z_{\odot}$, but changes to a bump
at $Z \lesssim 0.1 Z_{\odot}$. Using these spectral signatures, we can search

as test scores of students. In factor analysis and PCA, these features are
thought to be influenced by unobserved factors, such as skills. Can we
determine how many components affect the data? This is an important problem,
because it has a large impact on all downstream data analysis. Consequently,
many approaches have been developed to address it. Parallel Analysis is a
popular permutation method. It works by randomly scrambling each feature of the
data. It selects components if their singular values are larger than those of
the permuted data. Despite widespread use in leading textbooks and scientific
publications, as well as empirical evidence for its accuracy, it currently has
no theoretical justification.
  In this paper, we show that the parallel analysis permutation method
consistently selects the large components in certain high-dimensional factor
models. However, it does not select the smaller components. The intuition is
that permutations keep the noise invariant, while ""destroying"" the low-rank
signal. This provides justification for permutation methods in PCA and factor
models under some conditions. Our work uncovers drawbacks of permutation
methods, and paves the way to improvements.

underlying symmetry principles that constrain the interactions of massless

fashion by employing current algebras, recent attempts of extending such an
approach to known double soft theorems has been met with difficulties. In this
work, we have traced the difficulty to two inequivalent expansion schemes,
depending on whether the soft limit is taken asymmetrically or symmetrically,
which we denote as type A and B respectively. We show that soft-behaviour for
type A scheme can simply be derived from single soft theorems, and are thus
non-preturbatively protected. For type B, the information of the four-point
vertex is required to determine the corresponding soft theorems, and thus are
in general not protected. This argument can be readily extended to general
multi-soft theorems. We also ask whether unitarity can be emergent from
locality together with the two kinds of soft theorems, which has not been fully
investigated before.

domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language
processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation,
and bio-informatics, where they have produced results comparable to human
experts. However, these networks can be easily fooled by adversarial
perturbations: minimal changes to correctly-classified inputs, that cause the
network to mis-classify them. This phenomenon represents a concern for both
safety and security, but it is currently unclear how to measure a network's
robustness against such perturbations. Existing techniques are limited to
checking robustness around a few individual input points, providing only very
limited guarantees. We propose a novel approach for automatically identifying
safe regions of the input space, within which the network is robust against
adversarial perturbations. The approach is data-guided, relying on clustering
to identify well-defined geometric regions as candidate safe regions. We then
utilize verification techniques to confirm that these regions are safe or to
provide counter-examples showing that they are not safe. We also introduce the
notion of targeted robustness which, for a given target label and region,
ensures that a NN does not map any input in the region to the target label. We
evaluated our technique on the MNIST dataset and on a neural network
implementation of a controller for the next-generation Airborne Collision
Avoidance System for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). For these networks, our
approach identified multiple regions which were completely safe as well as some
which were only safe for specific labels. It also discovered several
adversarial perturbations of interest.

operation many times with a supercycle to achieve appropriate mixing time. When
we sweep through the resonances, midway between the resonances of the coupled

precess at same frequency around their effective fields. This means the
coupling, which normally gets averaged due to the chemical shift difference is
no more averaged for a short time and we get mixing. In this paper, we develop
these basic ideas. By virtue of its design, the chirp mixing is much more

given an input scene, our network explicitly learns to segment salient parts
and predict their pose-embedding along with their motion modeled as a change in
the pose space due to the applied actions. We train our model using a pair of
point clouds separated by an action and show that given supervision only in the
form of point-wise data associations between the frames our network is able to
learn a meaningful segmentation of the scene along with consistent poses. We
further show that our model can be used for closed-loop control directly in the
learned low-dimensional pose space, where the actions are computed by
minimizing error in the pose space using gradient-based methods, similar to
traditional model-based control. We present results on controlling a Baxter

incomplete event logs for the extraction and analysis of business processes. It
is quite common that event logs are incomplete with several amounts of missing
information (for instance, workers forget to register their tasks). Absence of
data is translated into a drastic decrease of precision and compromises the
decision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. We investigate
how classical probabilistic models are affected by incomplete event logs and we
explore quantum-like probabilistic inferences as an alternative mathematical
model to classical probability. This work represents a first step towards
systematic investigation of the impact of quantum interference in a real life
large scale decision scenario. The results obtained in this study indicate
that, under high levels of uncertainty, the quantum-like models generate
quantum interference terms, which allow an additional non-linear

which are physical quantities whose values are quantized and do not depend on
details of the measured system. Of these, the easiest to probe in experiments
is the electrical Hall conductance, which is expressed in units of $e^2/h$ ($e$
the electron charge, $h$ the Planck's constant). In the fractional quantum Hall
effect (FQHE), fractional quantized values of the electrical Hall conductance
attest to topologically ordered states, which are states that carry quasi
particles with fractional charge and anyonic statistics. Another topological
invariant, which is much harder to measure, is the thermal Hall conductance,
expressed in units of $\kappa_0T=(\pi^2kB^2/3h)T$ ($kB$ the Boltzmann constant,
$T$ the temperature). For the quantized thermal Hall conductance, a fractional
value attests that the probed state of matter is non-abelian. Quasi particles
in non-abelian states lead to a ground state degeneracy and perform topological
unitary transformations among ground states when braided. As such, they may be
useful for topological quantum computation. In this paper, we report our
measurements of the thermal Hall conductance for several quantum Hall states in

computational intractability of sampling protein conformational landscapes
associated with either large system size or long timescales. To overcome this
bottleneck, we present the REinforcement learning based Adaptive samPling
(REAP) algorithm that aims to efficiently sample conformational space by
learning the relative importance of each reaction coordinate as it samples the
landscape. To achieve this, the algorithm uses concepts from the field of
reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, which rewards sampling
along important degrees of freedom and disregards others that do not facilitate
exploration or exploitation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of REAP by
comparing the sampling to long continuous MD simulations and least-counts
adaptive sampling on two model landscapes (L-shaped and circular), and
realistic systems such as alanine dipeptide and Src kinase. In all four
systems, the REAP algorithm consistently demonstrates its ability to explore
conformational space faster than the other two methods when comparing the
expected values of the landscape discovered for a given amount of time. The key
advantage of REAP is on-the-fly estimation of the importance of collective
variables, which makes it particularly useful for systems with limited
structural information.

to many settings, including quality-preserving databases in science and
multiple A/B or multi-armed bandit tests for internet commerce. This paper
improves the class of generalized alpha-investing algorithms (GAI) in four
ways: (a) we show how to uniformly improve the power of the entire class of
monotone GAI procedures by awarding more alpha-wealth for each rejection,
giving a win-win resolution to a recent dilemma raised by Javanmard and
Montanari, (b) we demonstrate how to incorporate prior weights to indicate

all four generalizations simultaneously, and reduce to more powerful variants

In order to further boost this process, the next step is to migrate the results
achieved by means of bulky and expensive setups to miniaturized and affordable
devices. Integrated quantum photonics is exactly addressing this issue. In this
paper we briefly review the most recent advancements in the generation of
quantum states of light (at the core of quantum cryptography and computing) on
chip. In particular, we focus on optical microcavities, as they can offer a
solution to the issue of low efficiency (low number of photons generated)
typical of the materials mostly used in integrated platforms. In addition, we
show that specifically designed microcavities can also offer further
advantages, such as compatibility with existing telecom standard (thus allowing
to exploit the existing fiber network) and quantum memories (necessary in turns
to extend the communication distance), as well as longitudinal multimode
character. This last property (i.e. the increased dimensionality necessary for
describing the quantum state of a photon) is achieved thanks to the generating
multiple photon pairs on a frequency comb corresponding to the microcavity
resonances. Further achievements include the possibility to fully exploit the
polarization degree of freedom also for integrated devices. These results pave
the way to the generation of integrated quantum frequency combs, that in turn
may find application as quantum computing platform.

Generalized Covariance Intersection (GCI) method. Our analysis shows that GCI
fusion with labeled multi-object densities strongly relies on label
consistencies between local multi-object posteriors at different sensor nodes,
and hence suffers from a severe performance degradation when perfect label
consistencies are violated. Moreover, we mathematically analyze this phenomenon
from the perspective of Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information and the
so called yes-object probability. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a novel
and general solution for the distributed fusion with labeled multi-object
densities that is robust to label inconsistencies between sensors.
Specifically, the labeled multi-object posteriors are firstly marginalized to
their unlabeled posteriors which are then fused using GCI method. We also
introduce a principled method to construct the labeled fused density and
produce tracks formally. Based on the developed theoretical framework, we
present tractable algorithms for the family of generalized labeled
multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filters including $\delta$-GLMB, marginalized
$\delta$-GLMB and labeled multi-Bernoulli filters. The robustness and
efficiency of the proposed distributed fusion algorithm are demonstrated in

researched and developed due to their robustness, high precision, and density.
Because the techniques are based on decoding a pattern to find correspondences,
it implicitly requires that the projected patterns be clearly captured by an
image sensor, i.e., to avoid defocus and motion blur of the projected pattern.
Although intensive researches have been conducted for solving defocus blur, few
researches for motion blur and only solution is to capture with extremely fast
shutter speed. In this paper, unlike the previous approaches, we actively
utilize motion blur, which we refer to as a light flow, to estimate depth.
Analysis reveals that minimum two light flows, which are retrieved from two
projected patterns on the object, are required for depth estimation. To
retrieve two light flows at the same time, two sets of parallel line patterns
are illuminated from two video projectors and the size of motion blur of each
line is precisely measured. By analyzing the light flows, i.e. lengths of the
blurs, scene depth information is estimated. In the experiments, 3D shapes of
fast moving objects, which are inevitably captured with motion blur, are
successfully reconstructed by our technique.

sequence whenever $(\alpha_{k})$ is an $N_{\theta}^{2}$ quasi-Cauchy sequences
of points in $A$, where a sequence $(\alpha_{k})$ is called $N_{\theta}^{2}$
quasi-Cauchy if $(\Delta^{2} \alpha_{k})$ is an $N_{\theta}$ quasi-Cauchy
sequence where $\Delta^{2}\alpha_{k}=\alpha_{k+2}-2\alpha_{k+1}+\alpha_{k}$ for

minutiae template, which is the most popular in fingerprint recognition
systems. Various strategies are proposed in data embedding in order to maintain
the accuracy of fingerprint recognition as well as the undetectability of data
hiding. In bits replacement based data embedding, we replace the last few bits
of each element of the original minutiae template with the data to be hidden.
This strategy can be further improved using an optimized bits replacement based
data embedding, which is able to minimize the impact of data hiding on the
performance of fingerprint recognition. The third strategy is an order
preserving mechanism which is proposed to reduce the detectability of data
hiding. By using such a mechanism, it would be difficult for the attacker to
differentiate the minutiae template with hidden data from the original minutiae
templates. The experimental results show that the proposed data hiding scheme
achieves sufficient capacity for hiding common personal data, where the
accuracy of fingerprint recognition is acceptable after the data hiding.

pattern on the object and use just a single image for reconstruction. However,
if the motion of the object is too fast with respect to the exposure time of
the image sensor, patterns on the captured image are blurred and reconstruction
fails. In this paper, we impose multiple projection patterns into each single
captured image to realize temporal super resolution of the depth image
sequences. With our method, multiple patterns are projected onto the object
with higher fps than possible with a camera. In this case, the observed pattern
varies depending on the depth and motion of the object, so we can extract
temporal information of the scene from each single image. The decoding process
is realized using a learning-based approach where no geometric calibration is
needed. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method where sequential
shapes are reconstructed from a single image. Both quantitative evaluations and
comparisons with recent techniques were also conducted.

  If $2<n$, then we show that for $p\in (2,n)$, $(R_p)$: $L^p$-boundedness of

that for $p\in (2,n)$, $(R_p)$ has an open ended property and is stable under

this is because the attention in CNNs has been mainly implemented as attentive
pooling (i.e., it is applied to pooling) rather than as attentive convolution
(i.e., it is integrated into convolution). Convolution is the differentiator of
CNNs in that it can powerfully model the higher-level representation of a word
by taking into account its local fixed-size context in the input text t^x. In
this work, we propose an attentive convolution network, ATTCONV. It extends the
context scope of the convolution operation, deriving higher-level features for
a word not only from local context, but also information extracted from
nonlocal context by the attention mechanism commonly used in RNNs. This
nonlocal context can come (i) from parts of the input text t^x that are distant
or (ii) from extra (i.e., external) contexts t^y. Experiments on sentence
modeling with zero-context (sentiment analysis), single-context (textual
entailment) and multiple-context (claim verification) demonstrate the
effectiveness of ATTCONV in sentence representation learning with the
incorporation of context. In particular, attentive convolution outperforms
attentive pooling and is a strong competitor to popular attentive RNNs.

The ability to automatically select scientifically-important
transient events from an alert stream of many such events, and to conduct
follow-up observations in response, will become increasingly important in
astronomy. With wide-angle time domain surveys pushing to fainter limiting
magnitudes, the capability to follow-up on transient alerts far exceeds our
follow-up telescope resources, and effective target prioritization becomes
essential. The RoboNet-II microlensing program is a pathfinder project which
has developed an automated target selection process (RoboTAP) for gravitational
microlensing events which are observed in real-time using the Las Cumbres
Observatory telescope network. Aims. Follow-up telescopes typically have a much
smaller field-of-view compared to surveys, therefore the most promising
microlens- ing events must be automatically selected at any given time from an
annual sample exceeding 2000 events. The main challenge is to select between
events with a high planet detection sensitivity, aiming at the detection of
many planets and characterizing planetary anomalies. Methods. Our target
selection algorithm is a hybrid system based on estimates of the planet
detection zones around a microlens. It follows automatic anomaly alerts and
respects the expected survey coverage of specific events. Results. We introduce
the RoboTAP algorithm, whose purpose is to select and prioritize microlensing
events with high sensitivity to planetary companions. In this work, we
determine the planet sensitivity of the RoboNet follow-up program and provide a
working example of how a broker can be designed for a real-life transient
science program conducting follow-up observations in response to alerts,
exploring the issues that will confront similar programs being developed for
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other time domain surveys.

suspension layer (powder-snow cloud) was added. The physical basis and
mathematical formulation of these models is critically reviewed here, with the
following main findings: (i) Key assumptions in the original RKE model differ
substantially from established results on dense granular flows; in particular,
the effective friction coefficient decreases to zero with velocity in the RKE
model. (ii) In the variable-density model, non-canonical interpretation of the
energy balance leads to a third-order evolution equation for the flow depth or
density, whereas the stated assumptions imply a first-order equation. (iii) The
model for the suspension layer neglects gravity and disregards well established
theoretical and experimental results on particulate gravity currents. Some
options for improving these aspects are discussed.

electrodynamic coupling among pairs of electrons and their associated
exchange-correlation holes. This is done in a nonlocal-correlation energy term
$E_c^{nl}$, which permits density functional theory calculation in the
Kohn-Sham scheme. However, to map the nature of vdW forces in the fully
interacting materials system, it is necessary to compensate for associated
kinetic-correlation energy effects. Here we present a coupling-constant scaling
analysis that also permits us to compute the kinetic-correlation energy
$T_c^{nl}$ that is specific to the vdW-DF account of nonlocal correlations. We
thus provide a spatially-resolved analysis of the total nonlocal-correlation
binding, including vdW forces, in both covalently and non-covalently bonded
systems. We find that kinetic-correlation energy effects play a significant
role in the account of vdW or dispersion interactions among molecules. We also
find that the signatures that we reveal in our full-interaction mapping are
typically given by the spatial variation in the $E_c^{nl}$ binding
contributions, at least in a qualitative discussion. Furthermore, our full
mapping shows that the total nonlocal-correlation binding is concentrated to
pockets in the sparse electron distribution located between the material
fragments.

is the degradation in scan efficiency as the number of distinct datasets grows.
Sparse recovery techniques can alleviate this limitation via randomly
undersampled acquisitions. A frequent sampling strategy is to prescribe for
each acquisition a different random pattern drawn from a common sampling
density. However, naive random patterns often contain gaps or clusters across
the acquisition dimension that in turn can degrade reconstruction quality or
reduce scan efficiency. To address this problem, a statistically-segregated
sampling method is proposed for multiple-acquisition MRI. This method generates
multiple patterns sequentially, while adaptively modifying the sampling density
to minimize k-space overlap across patterns. As a result, it improves
incoherence across acquisitions while still maintaining similar sampling
density across the radial dimension of k-space. Comprehensive simulations and
in vivo results are presented for phase-cycled balanced steady-state free
precession and multi-echo T$_2$-weighted imaging. Segregated sampling achieves
significantly improved quality in both Fourier and compressed-sensing

in which an ultrasound system is used for displaying simultaneously both B-mode

used to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in the images. In contrast, for
Doppler imaging, narrow-band pulses are preferred in order to attain increased

performs efficient recovery based on the fast Fourier transform. The second
allows for continuous recovery of the Doppler frequencies, thus avoiding
off-grid error leakage, at the expense of increased complexity. The performance
of the techniques is evaluated using realistic Field II simulations as well as

multigroup multiple-input single-output system. Each base station (BS) serves
multiple groups of users by forming a single beam with common information per
group. We propose centralized and distributed beamforming algorithms for two
different optimization targets. The first objective is to minimize the total
transmission power of all the BSs while guaranteeing the user-specific minimum
quality-of-service targets. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method is used to
approximate the non-convex multicast problem as a semidefinite program (SDP),
which is solvable via centralized processing. Subsequently, two alternative
distributed methods are proposed. The first approach turns the SDP into a
two-level optimization via primal decomposition. At the higher level,
inter-cell interference powers are optimized for fixed beamformers while the
lower level locally optimizes the beamformers by minimizing BS-specific
transmit powers for the given inter-cell interference constraints. The second
distributed solution is enabled via an alternating direction method of
multipliers, where the inter-cell interference optimization is divided into a
local and a global optimization by forcing the equality via consistency
constraints. We further propose a centralized and a simple distributed
beamforming design for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
balancing problem in which the minimum SINR among the users is maximized with
given per-BS power constraints. This problem is solved via the bisection method
as a series of SDP feasibility problems. The simulation results show the
superiority of the proposed coordinated beamforming algorithms over traditional
non-coordinated transmission schemes, and illustrate the fast convergence of
the distributed methods.

visual appearance attributes of an object in addition to its shape. Since many
existing 3D file formats encode color and translucency by RGBA textures mapped
to 3D shapes, RGBA information is particularly important for practical
applications. In contrast to color (encoded by RGB), which is specified by the
object's reflectance, selected viewing conditions and a standard observer,
translucency (encoded by A) is neither linked to any measurable physical nor
perceptual quantity. Thus, reproducing translucency encoded by A is open for
interpretation.
  In this paper, we propose a rigorous definition for A suitable for use in
graphical 3D printing, which is independent of the 3D printing hardware and
software, and which links both optical material properties and perceptual
uniformity for human observers. By deriving our definition from the absorption
and scattering coefficients of virtual homogeneous reference materials with an
isotropic phase function, we achieve two important properties. First, a simple
adjustment of A is possible, which preserves the translucency appearance if an
object is re-scaled for printing. Second, determining the value of A for a real
(potentially non-homogeneous) material, can be achieved by minimizing a
distance function between light transport measurements of this material and
simulated measurements of the reference materials. Such measurements can be
conducted by commercial spectrophotometers used in graphic arts.
  Finally, we conduct visual experiments employing the method of constant
stimuli, and derive from them an embedding of A into a nearly perceptually
uniform scale of translucency for the reference materials.

effective pseudospin-one model and use a perturbative expansion based on the
imaginary-time Green's function theory. We also include the effects of an
inhomogeneous trapping potential by means of a local density approximation. We
find that the response function for the hopping modulation is equal to that for
the interaction modulation within our approximation. At the unit filling rate
and in the absence of a trapping potential, we show that the Higgs mode can
exist as a sharp resonance peak in the dynamical susceptibilities at typical
temperatures. However, the resonance peak is significantly broadened due to the
trapping potential when the modulations are applied globally to the entire

peak by partial modulations around the trap center.

that even a combination of all defenses is ineffective. Our new attack

flipping, bypasses recent isolation mechanisms by flipping bits in a
predictable and targeted way in userspace binaries. We replace conspicuous and
memory-exhausting spraying and grooming techniques with a novel reliable
technique called memory waylaying. Memory waylaying exploits system-level
optimizations and a side channel to coax the operating system into placing
target pages at attacker-chosen physical locations. Finally, we abuse Intel SGX

used for coordinated denial-of-service attacks in the cloud and for privilege

stresses emerge in an expanding and deforming tissue. Cell rearrangements can
dissipate these stresses and numerous experiments confirm the viscoelastic
properties of tissues [1]-[4]. On long time scales, as characteristic for many
developmental processes, tissue is therefore typically represented as a liquid,
viscous material and is then described by the Stokes equation [5]-[7]. On short
time scales, however, tissues have mainly elastic properties. In discrete
cell-based tissue models, the elastic tissue properties are realized by springs
between cell vertices [8], [9]. In this article, we adopt a macroscale
perspective of tissue and consider it as homogeneous material. Therefore, we
may use the ""Structural Mechanics"" module in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to

communication using a strong randomness extractor; choosing a quantum-proof

  In the case that the channel is not authenticated, Dodis and Wichs (STOC'09)

  We give the first construction of a non-malleable extractor that is secure

decomposition of this wavepacket into a set of ""modes"" (a basis that spans an

well-known tools are the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD). To synergize the strengths of both methods, a hybrid
POD-FFT is pioneered, using the FFT as a tool for interpreting the POD modes.
The POD-FFT automatically identifies well-known fundamental, subharmonic and
Klebanoff modes in the flow, even though it is blind to the underlying physics.
Moreover, the POD-FFT further separates the subharmonic content of the
wavepacket into three fairly distinct parts: a positively detuned mode
resembling a Lambda-vortex, a Craik-type tuned mode and a Herbert-type
positive-negative detuned mode pair, in decreasing order of energy. This
distinction is less widely recognized, but it provides a possible explanation
for the slightly positively detuned subharmonic mode often observed in previous

a good proxy for brain activity in an EEG channel during an epoch of 30
seconds. Different channels and persons can be compared when they are measured
with the same device and prefiltering options. This could lead to a rigorously
defined and suitably standardized biomarker of cortex activity, like blood
pressure or laboratory values. Applied to sleep EEG, the algorithm yields
hypnograms with continuous scale which show amazing coincidence with sleep
stage annotation by trained experts. Although produced by a crude method,
continuous hypnograms provide a lot of details. For example, sleep depth
usually decreases from evening to morning even within the same annotated sleep
stage, except for REM phases where mean sleep depth is rather constant, but
different in frontal and parietal channels. The diagnostic potential of the
method is demonstrated with two hypnograms of narcoleptic patients. In all 10
subjects, infra-slow oscillations of activity with a wavelength between 30s and

consider raw subsequence matching (RSM) and do not support subsequence
normalization. UCR Suite can deal with normalized subsequence match problem
(NSM), but it needs to scan full time series. In this paper, we propose a novel
problem, named constrained normalized subsequence matching problem (cNSM),

flexibly control the degree of offset shifting and amplitude scaling, which
enables users to build the index to process the query. We propose a new index

our approach can support both RSM and cNSM problems under either ED or DTW

local files or HBase tables. To support the query of arbitrary lengths, we
extend KV-match to KV-match$_{DP}$, which utilizes multiple varied-length

Our results show that misuse of cryptographic APIs is still widespread, with

growing rapidly below ~20 K is due to a rapidly increasing \mu_h/\mu_e

irradiation, together with a dynamical matrix approach and bond polarizability
model based on first-principle calculations for the estimation of Raman
spectra. We observe two stages of the laser-induced densification and Raman
spectrum evolution: growth during several hundreds of pulses followed by
further saturation. At the medium-range, the network connectivity change in
v-SiO2 is expressed in reduction of major ring fractions leading to more
compacted structure. With the help of Sen & Thorpe model, we also study the
short-range order transformation and derive the interbonding Si-O-Si angle
change from the Raman measurements. Experimental findings are in excellent
agreement with our MD simulations, and, hence, support bond-breaking mechanism

laser-induced changes both in the short-range order caused by the appearance of
Si-coordination defects and medium-range order connected to evolution of the

from three-dimensional Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase to a band insulator phase
such as Chern band insulator (CI) phase. The phase transition is described by a
new critical theory with a `magnetic dipole' like object in the momentum space.
In this paper, we reveal that the critical theory hosts a novel disorder-driven
quantum multicritical point, which is encompassed by three quantum phases,
renormalized WSM phase, CI phase, and diffusive metal (DM) phase. Based on the
renormalization group argument, we first clarify scaling properties around the
band touching points at the quantum multicritical point as well as all phase
boundaries among these three phases. Based on numerical calculations of
localization length, density of states and critical conductance distribution,
we next prove that a localization-delocalization transition between the CI
phase with a finite zero-energy density of states (zDOS) and DM phase belongs
to an ordinary 3D unitary class. Meanwhile, a localization-delocalization
transition between the Chern insulator phase with zero zDOS and a renormalized
Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase turns out to be a direct phase transition whose

many methods are currently available. A popular kernel classifier is the
Gaussian process classifier (GPC), since it approaches the classification
problem with a solid probabilistic treatment, thus yielding confidence
intervals for the predictions as well as very competitive results to
state-of-the-art neural networks and support vector machines. However, its
computational cost is prohibitive for large scale applications, and constitutes
the main obstacle precluding wide adoption. This paper tackles this problem by
introducing two novel efficient methodologies for Gaussian Process (GP)
classification. We first include the standard random Fourier features
approximation into GPC, which largely decreases its computational cost and
permits large scale remote sensing image classification. In addition, we
propose a model which avoids randomly sampling a number of Fourier frequencies,
and alternatively learns the optimal ones within a variational Bayes approach.
The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in complex problems of
cloud detection from multispectral imagery and infrared sounding data.
Excellent empirical results support the proposal in both computational cost and
accuracy.

(TDDFT) are often capable of providing quantitative description of heavy ion
reactions. However, the structure of pre-compound states produced in heavy ion
reactions are difficult to assess theoretically in TDDFT as the s.p. density
alone is a weak indicator of shell structure and cluster states. Purpose: We
employ the time-dependent nucleon localization function (NLF) to reveal
structure of pre-compound states in nuclear reactions involving light and
medium-mass ions. We primarily focus on spin saturated systems with N = Z.
Furthermore, we study reactions with oxygen and carbon ions, for which
experimental evidence for {\alpha} clustering in pre-compound states exists.
Method: We utilize the symmetry-free TDDFT approach and compute the NLFs to
describe $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca, and
$^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C collisions at energies above the Coulomb barrier.
Results: We show that NLFs reveal a variety of time-dependent modes involving
cluster structures. For instance, the $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O collision results in
a vibrational mode of a quasi-molecular \alpha-$^{12}$C-$^{12}$C-\alpha{}
state. For heavier ions, a variety of cluster configurations are predicted. For
the collision of $^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C, we showed that the pre-compound system
has a tendency to form {\alpha} clusters. This result supports the experimental
findings that the presence of cluster structures in the projectile and target
nuclei gives rise to strong entrance channel effects and enhanced {\alpha}
emission. Conclusion: The time-dependent NLF is a good indicator of clusters
structures in complex pre-compound states formed in heavy-ion fusion reactions.
The localization reveals the presence of collective vibrations involving
cluster structures, which dominate the initial dynamics of the fusing system.

By considering turbulent magnetized jets mixed with fluctuation magnetic fields

electron injections, location of an acceleration region, and various cooling
rates on acceleration efficiency. The results show that (1) the existence of
the dominant turbulent magnetic fields in the jets is necessary to accelerate
background thermal electrons to relativistic energies. (2) Acceleration rates
of electrons depend on magnetohydrodynamic turbulence types, from which the
turbulence type with a hard slope can accelerate electrons more effectively.
(3) An effective acceleration region should be located at the distance
$>10^3R_{\rm g}$ away from the central black hole ($R_{\rm g}$ being a
gravitational radius). As a result of acceleration rates competing with various
cooling rates, background thermal electrons obtain not only an increase in
their energies but also their spectra are broadened beyond the given initial
distribution to form a thermal-like distribution. (4) The acceleration
mechanisms explored in this work can reasonably provide the electron maximum
energy required for interpreting high-energy $\gamma$-ray observations from
microquasars, but it needs to adopt some extreme parameters in order to predict
a possible very high-energy $\gamma$-ray signal.

conditional lower bounds in order to reveal the inner structure of the class P.
These conditional lower bounds are based on many popular conjectures on
well-studied problems. One of the most heavily used conjectures is the
celebrated Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). It turns out that
conditional hardness proved based on SETH goes, in many cases, through an
intermediate problem - the Orthogonal Vectors (OV) problem.
  Almost all research work regarding conditional lower bound was concentrated
on time complexity. Very little attention was directed toward space complexity.
In a recent work, Goldstein et al.[WADS 2017] set the stage for proving
conditional lower bounds regarding space and its interplay with time. In this
spirit, it is tempting to investigate the space complexity of a data structure
variant of OV which is called \emph{OV indexing}. In this problem $n$ boolean
vectors of size $c\log{n}$ are given for preprocessing. As a query, a vector
$v$ is given and we are required to verify if there is an input vector that is
orthogonal to it or not.
  This OV indexing problem is interesting in its own, but it also likely to
have strong implications on problems known to be conditionally hard, in terms
of time complexity, based on OV. Having this in mind, we study OV indexing in
this paper from many aspects. We give some space-efficient algorithms for the
problem, show a tradeoff between space and query time, describe how to solve
its reporting variant, shed light on an interesting connection between this
problem and the well-studied SetDisjointness problem and demonstrate how it can
be solved more efficiently on random input.

evident from comparison of solar and coronal observations. The calculated Dst

context of task offloading is studied in a multi-user MEC scenario. In contrast
with current system designs relying on average metrics (e.g., the average queue
length and average latency), a novel network design is proposed in which
latency and reliability constraints are taken into account. This is done by
imposing a probabilistic constraint on users' task queue lengths and invoking
results from extreme value theory to characterize the occurrence of
low-probability events in terms of queue length (or queuing delay) violation.
The problem is formulated as a computation and transmit power minimization
subject to latency and reliability constraints, and solved using tools from
Lyapunov stochastic optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, while examining the power-delay
tradeoff and required computational resources for various computation

in 70+ years in all aspects of ER, there is still a high demand for
democratizing ER - humans are heavily involved in labeling data, performing
feature engineering, tuning parameters, and defining blocking functions. With
the recent advances in deep learning, in particular distributed representation
of words (a.k.a. word embeddings), we present a novel ER system, called DeepER,
that achieves good accuracy, high efficiency, as well as ease-of-use (i.e.,
much less human efforts). For accuracy, we use sophisticated composition
methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with
long short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a
distributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to
effectively capture similarities between tuples. We consider both the case
where pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are
not; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations. For
efficiency, we propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking
approach that uses distributed representations of tuples; it takes all
attributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks,
compared with traditional methods that consider only a few attributes. For
ease-of-use, DeepER requires much less human labeled data and does not need
feature engineering, compared with traditional machine learning based
approaches which require handcrafted features, and similarity functions along
with their associated thresholds. We evaluate our algorithms on multiple
datasets (including benchmarks, biomedical data, as well as multi-lingual data)
and the extensive experimental results show that DeepER outperforms existing
solutions.

The novelty of the contribution is the inclusion of error regressors in the

algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent to compute the parameters of the
NARMAX models for the entire regularization path. It deals with the error terms
by updating the regressor matrix along with the parameter vector. In
comparative timings we find that the modification does not reduce the
computational efficiency of the original algorithm and can provide the most
important regressors in very few inexpensive iterations. The method is
illustrated for linear and polynomial models by means of two examples.

translocation \textit{in vivo}. A dynamical Monte Carlo method is used to
simulate the translocation of a stiff homopolymer through a nanopore driven by
chaperones. Chaperones are proteins that bind to the polymer near the wall and
prevent its backsliding through Cis side. The important parameters include
binding energy, size and the local concentration of the chaperones. The profile
of these local concentrations, build up the chaperones distribution. Here we
investigate the effects of binding energy, size and the exponential
distribution of chaperones in their equilibration in each step of the polymer
translocation needed for stable translocation time. The simulation results show
that in case of chaperones with the size of a monomer ($\lambda=1$) and/or
positive effective binding energy and/or uniform distribution, the chaperones
binding equilibration rate/frequency is less than $5$ times per monomer.
However, in some special cases in the exponential distribution of chaperones
with size $\lambda>1$ and negative effective binding energy the equilibration
rate will diverge to more than $20$ times per monomer. We show that this
non-equilibrium effect results in supper diffusion, seen before. Moreover, we
confirm the equilibration process theoretically.

identification and location-domination in the circulant graphs $C_n(1,3)$. They
showed that the smallest cardinality of a locating-dominating code in
$C_n(1,3)$ is at least $\lceil n/3 \rceil$ and at most $\lceil n/3 \rceil + 1$
for all $n \geq 9$. Moreover, they proved that the lower bound is strict when
$n \equiv 0, 1, 4 \pmod{6}$ and conjectured that the lower bound can be

instead of making use of the local properties of the graphs as is usual to
identification and location-domination, also manages to take advantage of the

individual privacy is a major barrier to greater availability of data. The
model of differential privacy has emerged as an accepted model to release
sensitive information while giving a statistical guarantee for privacy. Many
different algorithms are possible to address different target functions. We
focus on the core problem of count queries, and seek to design mechanisms to
release data associated with a group of n individuals. Prior work has focused
on designing mechanisms by raw optimization of a loss function, without regard
to the consequences on the results. This can leads to mechanisms with
undesirable properties, such as never reporting some outputs (gaps), and
overreporting others (spikes). We tame these pathological behaviors by
introducing a set of desirable properties that mechanisms can obey. Any
combination of these can be satisfied by solving a linear program (LP) which
minimizes a cost function, with constraints enforcing the properties. We focus
on a particular cost function, and provide explicit constructions that are
optimal for certain combinations of properties, and show a closed form for
their cost. In the end, there are only a handful of distinct optimal mechanisms
to choose between: one is the well-known (truncated) geometric mechanism; the
second a novel mechanism that we introduce here, and the remainder are found as
the solution to particular LPs. These all avoid the bad behaviors we identify.
We demonstrate in a set of experiments on real and synthetic data which is
preferable in practice, for different combinations of data distributions,

  Co-location: A Mixture of Experts Approach","ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware 2017",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data analytic applications built upon big data processing frameworks such as
Apache Spark are an important class of applications. Many of these applications
are not latency-sensitive and thus can run as batch jobs in data centers. By
running multiple applications on a computing host, task co-location can
significantly improve the server utilization and system throughput. However,
effective task co-location is a non-trivial task, as it requires an
understanding of the computing resource requirement of the co-running
applications, in order to determine what tasks, and how many of them, can be
co-located.
  In this paper, we present a mixture-of-experts approach to model the memory
behavior of Spark applications. We achieve this by learning, off-line, a range
of specialized memory models on a range of typical applications; we then
determine at runtime which of the memory models, or experts, best describes the
memory behavior of the target application. We show that by accurately
estimating the resource level that is needed, a co-location scheme can
effectively determine how many applications can be co-located on the same host
to improve the system throughput, by taking into consideration the memory and
CPU requirements of co-running application tasks. Our technique is applied to a
set of representative data analytic applications built upon the Apache Spark
framework. We evaluated our approach for system throughput and average
normalized turnaround time on a multi-core cluster. Our approach achieves over
83.9% of the performance delivered using an ideal memory predictor. We obtain,
on average, 8.69x improvement on system throughput and a 49% reduction on
turnaround time over executing application tasks in isolation, which translates
to a 1.28x and 1.68x improvement over a state-of-the-art co-location scheme for
system throughput and turnaround time respectively.

but receives a large, previously neglected correction on the unit prefactor.
Using our nonperturbative prescription in place of the mean field result, we
observe large corrections of the same magnitude to the continuous time limit of
the static baryon mass, and of the location of the phase boundary associated
with chiral symmetry restoration. In particular, the phase boundary, evaluated
on different finite lattices, has a dramatically smaller dependence on the
lattice time extent. We also estimate, as a byproduct, the pion decay constant
and the chiral condensate of massless SU(3) QCD in the strong coupling limit at
zero temperature.

superconducting quantum point contact (SQPC) with split gate technology in a
superconductor, utilizing the unique gate tunability of the two dimensional
superfluid at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface. When the constriction is

coupled to the reservoirs. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of a new

proposed by studying the adjacency matrix of the three-vertex undirected
network motifs. The algorithm is for mapping from the adjacency matrix of a
network to a binary image, it shows a new perspective of network structure
visualization. In summary, this model provides a useful approach towards
building link between images and networks and offers a new way of representing

signaling technique that has recently emerged in the literature to tackle the
time-varying (TV) wireless channels. OTFS deploys the Doppler-delay plane to
multiplex the transmit data where the time variations of the TV channel are
integrated over time and hence the equivalent channel relating the input and
output of the system boils down to a time-invariant one. This signaling
technique can be implemented on the top of a given multicarrier waveform with
the addition of precoding and post-processing units to the modulator and
demodulator. In this paper, we present discrete-time formulation of an
OFDM-based OTFS system. We argue against deployment of window functions at the
OTFS transmitter in realistic scenarios and thus limit any sort of windowing to
the receiver side. We study the channel impact in discrete-time providing
deeper insights into OTFS systems. Moreover, our derivations lead to simplified

reactions at these energies provide further information on the issue of chiral

to be connected in the cheapest possible way in an edge-weighted graph. This

also parametrization. In particular, on one hand Steiner Tree is known to be
APX-hard, and W[2]-hard on the other, if parameterized by the number of
non-terminals (Steiner vertices) in the optimum solution. In contrast to this
we give an efficient parameterized approximation scheme (EPAS), which
circumvents both hardness results. Moreover, our methods imply the existence of
a polynomial size approximate kernelization scheme (PSAKS) for the considered
parameter.
  We further study the parameterized approximability of other variants of
Steiner Tree, such as Directed Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest. For neither of
these an EPAS is likely to exist for the studied parameter: for Steiner Forest
an easy observation shows that the problem is APX-hard, even if the input graph
contains no Steiner vertices. For Directed Steiner Tree we prove that
approximating within any function of the studied parameter is W[1]-hard.
Nevertheless, we show that an EPAS exists for Unweighted Directed Steiner Tree,
but a PSAKS does not. We also prove that there is an EPAS and a PSAKS for
Steiner Forest if in addition to the number of Steiner vertices, the number of
connected components of an optimal solution is considered to be a parameter.

associate to each point in the projection's image the sup (inf) of the function

Plots of profile extrema functions convey a simple, although intrinsically
partial, visualization of the set. We consider expensive to evaluate functions

$n<100d$, and we surrogate $f$ with a posterior quantity of a Gaussian process

studying the distribution of GP profile extrema with posterior
quasi-realizations obtained from an approximating process. We control such
approximation with a bound inherited from the Borell-TIS inequality. The

polar coordinates and do not consider oscillations of fixed magnitude. We
propose a synchronizing feedback based on relative state information and local
measurements that induces consensus-like dynamics. We show that, under a mild
stability condition, the combination of the synchronizing feedback with a
decentralized magnitude control law renders the oscillators' almost globally
asymptotically stable with respect to set-points for the phase shift,
frequency, and magnitude. We apply these result to rigorously solve an open
problem in control of inverter-based AC power systems. In this context, the
proposed control strategy can be implemented using purely local information,
induces a grid-forming behavior, and ensures that a network of AC power
inverters is almost globally asymptotically stable with respect to a
pre-specified solution of the AC power-flow equations. Moreover, we show that
the controller exhibits a droop-like behavior around the standard operating
point thus making it backward-compatible with the existing power system
operation.

flat or flared emitting surface in Keplerian rotation, we uncover significant
residuals with a peak of $\approx7\delta v$, where $\delta v = 0.21$ km
s$^{-1}$ is the width of a spectral resolution element. The residuals reveal
the possible presence of a severely warped and twisted inner disk extending to
at most 100au. Adapting the model to include a misaligned inner gas disk with
(i) an inclination almost edge-on to the line of sight, and (ii) a position
angle almost orthogonal to that of the outer disk reduces the residuals to $<
3\delta v$. However, these findings are contrasted by recent VLT/SPHERE,
MagAO/GPI, and VLTI/PIONIER observations of HD100546 that show no evidence of a
severely misaligned inner dust disk down to spatial scales of $\sim 1$au. An
alternative explanation for the observed kinematics are fast radial flows
mediated by (proto)planets. Inclusion of a radial velocity component at close
to free-fall speeds and inwards of $\approx 50$au results in residuals of
$\approx 4 \delta v$. Hence, the model including a radial velocity component
only does not reproduce the data as well as that including a twisted and
misaligned inner gas disk. Molecular emission data at a higher spatial
resolution (of order 10au) are required to further constrain the kinematics
within $\lesssim 100$au. HD100546 joins several other protoplanetary disks for
which high spectral resolution molecular emission shows that the gas velocity
structure cannot be described by a purely Keplerian velocity profile with a
universal inclination and position angle. Regardless of the process, the most
likely cause is the presence of an unseen planetary companion. (Abridged)

angle information and power angular spectrum (PAS) of each multi-path channel
is extracted from the instantaneous uplink channel state information (CSI).
Then, the uplink CCM is reconstructed and can be used to improve the uplink
channel estimation without any additional training cost. In virtue of angle
reciprocity as well as PAS reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels,
the downlink CCM could also be inferred with a similar approach even for FDD
massive MIMO systems. Then, the downlink instantaneous CSI can be obtained by
training towards the dominant eigen-directions of each user. The proposed
strategy is applicable for any kind of PAS distributions and array geometries.
Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
methods over the existing ones.

the last two decades has been very fast, with the precision measurements of the
neutrino squared-mass differences and of the mixing angles, including the last
unknown mixing angle $\theta_{13}$.
  Today a very large set of oscillation results obtained with a variety of
experimental configurations and techniques can be interpreted in the framework
of three active massive neutrinos, whose mass and flavour eigenstates are
related by a 3 $\times$ 3 unitary mixing matrix, the
Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, parameterized by three mixing
angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and a CP-violating phase
$\delta_{CP}$. The additional parameters governing neutrino oscillations are
the squared-mass differences $\Delta m^2_{ji}=m^2_j-m^2_i$, where $m_i$ is the
mass of the $i$th neutrino mass eigenstate. This review covers the rise of the
PMNS three-neutrino mixing paradigm and the current status of the experimental
determination of its parameters.
  The next years will continue to see a rich program of experimental endeavour
coming to fruition and addressing the three missing pieces of the puzzle,
namely the determination of the octant and precise value of the mixing angle
$\theta_{23}$, the unveiling of the neutrino mass ordering (whether $m_1 < m_2
< m_3$ or $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$) and the measurement of the CP-violating phase

of nucleons with nuclei. Even if this process has been extensively studied in
the last years, a consistent description, i.e., starting from microscopic two-
and many-body forces connected by the same symmetries and principles, is still
under development. Purpose: In a previous paper we derived a theoretical
optical potential from NN chiral potentials at fourth order (N3LO). In the
present work we use NN chiral potentials at fifth order (N4LO), with the
purpose to check the convergence and to assess the theoretical errors
associated with the truncation of the chiral expansion in the construction of
an optical potential. Methods: The optical potential is derived as the
first-order term within the spectator expansion of the nonrelativistic multiple
scattering theory and adopting the impulse approximation and the optimum
factorization approximation. Results: The pp and np Wolfenstein amplitudes and
the cross section, analyzing power, and spin rotation of elastic proton
scattering from 16O, 12C, and 40Ca nuclei are presented at an incident proton
energy of 200 MeV. The results obtained with different versions of chiral
potentials at N4LO are compared. Conclusions: Our results indicate that
convergence has been reached at N4LO. The agreement with the experimental data
is comparable with the agreement obtained in our previous work. We confirm that
building an optical potential within chiral perturbation theory is a promising
approach for describing elastic proton-nucleus scattering.

sciences are typically modelled as a set of Ordinary, Partial, or Stochastic
Differential or Difference Equations. Algorithms for learning the structure and
the parameters of a dynamical system are distinguished based on whether time is
discrete or continuous, observations are time-series or time-course, and
whether the system is deterministic or stochastic, however, there is no
approach able to handle the various types of dynamical systems simultaneously.
In this paper, we present a unified approach to infer both the structure and
the parameters of nonlinear dynamical systems of any type under the restriction
of being linear with respect to the unknown parameters. Our approach, which is
named Unified Sparse Dynamics Learning (USDL), constitutes of two steps. First,
an atemporal system of equations is derived through the application of the weak
formulation. Then, assuming a sparse representation for the dynamical system,
we show that the inference problem can be expressed as a sparse signal recovery
problem, allowing the application of an extensive body of algorithms and
theoretical results. Results on simulated data demonstrate the efficacy and
superiority of the USDL algorithm as a function of the experimental setup
(sample size, number of time measurements, number of interventions, noise
level). Additionally, USDL's accuracy significantly correlates with theoretical
metrics such as the exact recovery coefficient. On real single-cell data, the
proposed approach is able to induce high-confidence subgraphs of the signaling
pathway. USDL algorithm has been integrated in SCENERY

  analysis with an application to infant mortality in the US population","31 pages, 7 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In mediation analysis, the effect of an exposure (or treatment) on an outcome
variable is decomposed into two components: a direct effect, which pertains to
an immediate influence of the exposure on the outcome, and an indirect effect,
which the exposure exerts on the outcome through a third variable called
mediator. Our motivating example concerns the relationship between maternal
smoking (the exposure, $X$), birthweight (the mediator, $M$), and infant
mortality (the outcome, $Y$), which has attracted the interest of
epidemiologists and statisticians for many years. We introduce new causal
estimands, named $u$-specific direct and indirect effects, which describe the
direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome at a specific
quantile $u$ of the mediator, $0 < u < 1$. Under sequential ignorability we
derive an interesting and novel decomposition of $u$-specific indirect effects.
The components of this decomposition have a straightforward interpretation and
can provide new insights into the complexity of the mechanisms underlying the
indirect effect. We illustrate the proposed methods using data on infant
mortality in the US population. We provide analytical evidence that supports
the hypothesis that the risk of sudden infant death syndrome is not predicted
by changes in the birthweight distribution.

fundamental fact that along with breaking the global U(1) symmetry, superfluids
also break time-translation symmetry. While the standard discussion of the time
crystallization phenomenon is based on the notion of the global phase and
genuine condensate, for the superfluidity to take place in two dimensions an
algebraic (topological) order is sufficient. We find that the absence of
long-range order in a finite-temperature two-dimensional superfluid translates
into in an algebraic time crystallization caused by the temporal phase
correlations. The exponent controlling the algebraic decay is a universal
function of the superfluid-stiffness-to-temperature ratio; this exponent can be
also seen in the power-law singularity of the Fourier spectrum of the AC
Josephson current. We elaborate on subtleties involved in defining the
phenomenon of time crystallization in both classical-filed and all-quantum
cases and propose an experimental protocol in which the broken time translation
symmetry---more precisely, temporal correlations of the relative phase, with
all possible finite-size, dimensional, and quantum effects included---can be
observed without permanently keeping two superfluids in a contact.

solution which enables the use of discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) and OFDM, which address different
requirements, using a common reference symbol (RS) design. In this solution,
the DFT-s-OFDM symbol contains RSs in the frequency domain that may be shared
by a subsequent OFDM symbol. The proposed scheme is generated by puncturing the
output of a DFT-spread block and replacing the punctured samples with RSs in
frequency. We prove that puncturing the interleaved samples at the output of
the DFT-spread operation equivalently introduces a periodic interference to the
data symbols at the input of the DFT-spread operation. We show that the
interference due to the puncturing can be removed with a low-complexity
receiver by exploiting the zeros inserted to certain locations before the
DFT-spread block at the transmitter. Simulation results support that the
proposed scheme removes the error floor caused by the puncturing and achieves
lower peak-to-average-power ratio than OFDM.

modern physics because it requires an amount of computational resources that

state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact
classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of
restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently
represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and
ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a new representation of states
based on variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders are a type of
generative model in the form of a neural network. We probe the power of this
representation by encoding probability distributions associated with states
from different classes. Our simulations show that deep networks give a better
representation for states that are hard to sample from, while providing no
benefit for random states. This suggests that the probability distributions
associated to hard quantum states might have a compositional structure that can
be exploited by layered neural networks. Specifically, we consider the
learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans.
Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for
quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good
level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be
suitable for characterising states of the size expected in first generation
quantum hardware.

scientific and technological areas as they generally express the impossibility
to have a complete description of a system via a finite number of information
measures. In particular, they gave rise to the design of various quantifiers
(statistical complexity measures) of the internal complexity of a (quantum)
system. In this paper, we introduce a three-parametric Fisher-R\'enyi
complexity, named $(p,\beta,\lambda)$-Fisher--R\'enyi complexity. This
complexity measure quantifies the combined balance of the spreading and the
gradient contents of $\rho$, and has the three main properties of a statistical
complexity: the invariance under translation and scaling transformations, and a
universal bounding from below. The latter is proved by generalizing the Stam
inequality, which lowerbounds the product of the Shannon entropy power and the
Fisher information of a probability density function. An extension of this
inequality was already proposed by Bercher and Lutwak, a particular case of the
general one, where the three parameters are linked, allowing to determine the
sharp lower bound and the associated probability density with minimal
complexity. Using the notion of differential-escort deformation, we are able to
determine the sharp bound of the complexity measure even when the three
parameters are decoupled (in a certain range). We determine as well the
distribution that saturates the inequality: the $(p,\beta,\lambda)$-Gaussian
distribution, which involves an inverse incomplete beta function. Finally, the
complexity measure is calculated for various quantum-mechanical states of the
harmonic and hydrogenic systems, which are the two main prototypes of physical

modifies universal surface properties. Taking this refinement into account, we

movement of organisms and processes between intact habitat areas, and thus
provide connectivity between the habitats within the landscapes. Corridors are
thus regions within a given landscape that connect fragmented habitat patches
within the landscape. The major concern of designing corridors as a
conservation strategy is primarily to counter, and to the extent possible,
mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and loss on the biodiversity of
the landscape, as well as support continuance of land use for essential local
and global economic activities in the region of reference. In this paper, we
use game theory, graph theory, membership functions and chain code algorithm to
model and design a set of wildlife corridors with tiger (Panthera tigris
tigris) as the focal species. We identify the parameters which would affect the
tiger population in a landscape complex and using the presence of these
identified parameters construct a graph using the habitat patches supporting
tiger presence in the landscape complex as vertices and the possible paths
between them as edges. The passage of tigers through the possible paths have
been modelled as an Assurance game, with tigers as an individual player. The
game is played recursively as the tiger passes through each grid considered for
the model. The iteration causes the tiger to choose the most suitable path
signifying the emergence of adaptability. As a formal explanation of the game,
we model this interaction of tiger with the parameters as deterministic finite
automata, whose transition function is obtained by the game payoff.

having good stability properties with respect to infinitely many derivatives
and compositions. They are well-suited for solving non-linear functional
equations by means of hard implicit function theorems. They comprise Gevrey
functions and thus, as a limiting case, analytic functions. Using majorizing
series, we manage to characterize them in terms of a real sequence M bounding
the growth of derivatives. In this functional setting, we prove two fundamental
results of Hamiltonian perturbation theory: the invariant torus theorem, where
the invariant torus remains ultra-differentiable under the assumption that its
frequency satisfies some arithmetic condition which we call BR M , and which
generalizes the Bruno-R{\""u}ssmann condition ; and Nekhoroshev's theorem, where
the stability time depends on the ultra-differentiable class of the
pertubation, through the same sequence M. Our proof uses periodic averaging,
while a substitute of the analyticity width allows us to bypass analytic
smoothing. We also prove converse statements on the destruction of invariant
tori and on the existence of diffusing orbits with ultra-differentiable
perturbations, by respectively mimicking a construction of Bessi (in the
analytic category) and Marco-Sauzin (in the Gevrey non-analytic category). When
the perturbation space satisfies some additional condition (we then call it
matching), we manage to narrow the gap between stability hypotheses (e.g. the
BR M condition) and instability hypotheses, thus circumbscribing the stability
threshold. The formulas relating the growth M of derivatives of the
perturbation on the one hand, and the arithmetics of robust frequencies or the
stability time on the other hand, bring light to the competition between
stability properties of nearly integrable systems and the distance to
integrability. Due to our method of proof using width of regularity as a
regularizing parameter, these formulas are closer to optimal as the the
regularity tends to analyticity.

Quadratic Program. Such problems occur naturally in many scientific and web
applications. Although there are efficient methods which tackle this problem,
they are mostly not scalable. In this paper, we develop a method that
transforms the quadratic constraint into a linear form by sampling a set of
low-discrepancy points. The transformed problem can then be solved by applying
any state-of-the-art large-scale quadratic programming solvers. We show the
convergence of our approximate solution to the true solution as well as some
finite sample error bounds. Experimental results are also shown to prove
scalability as well as improved quality of approximation in practice.

note that initially the constant did not appear in connection with quanta.
Furthermore, we emphasize that Planck's constant can appear in both classical
and quantum theories. In both theories, Planck's constant sets the scale of
atomic phenomena. However, the roles played in the foundations of the theories
are sharply different. In quantum theory, Planck's constant is crucial to the
structure of the theory. On the other hand, in classical electrodynamics,
Planck's constant is optional, since it appears only as the scale factor for
the (homogeneous) source-free contribution to the general solution of Maxwell's
equations. Since classical electrodynamics can be solved while taking the
homogenous source-free contribution in the solution as zero or non-zero, there
are naturally two different theories of classical electrodynamics, one in which
Planck's constant is taken as zero and one where it is taken as non-zero. The
textbooks of classical electromagnetism present only the version in which
Planck's constant is taken to vanish.

congestion in transportation systems. Traffic congestion avoiding can be
achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning.
Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected
by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and
sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely
collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible
to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a
deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the
traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses
three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and
trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a
branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the
three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series
prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the
transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP
outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in
prediction accuracy.

time coupled to two thermal reservoirs with a finite heat capacity: The
Carnot-type cycle and the Lorenz-type cycle. By means of the endo-reversible
thermodynamics, we then discuss the power output of engine and its
optimization. In doing so, we treat the temporal duration of a single cycle
rigorously, i.e., without neglecting the duration of its adiabatic parts. Then
we find that the maximally obtainable power output P_m and the engine
efficiency \eta_m at the point of P_m explicitly depend on the heat conductance
and the compression ratio. From this, it is immediate to observe that the
well-known results available in many references, in particular the
(compression-ratio-independent) Curzon-Ahlborn-Novikov expressions such as
\eta_m --> \eta_{CAN} = 1 - (T_L/T_H)^(1/2) with the temperatures (T_H, T_L) of
hot and cold reservoirs only, can be recovered, but, significantly enough, in
the limit of a vanishingly small heat conductance and an infinitely large
compression ratio only. Our result implies that the endo-reversible model of a
thermal machine operating in a finite time and so producing a finite power
output with the Curzon-Ahlborn-Novikov results should be limited in its own

set of theoretical frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as
Integral Biomathics. That effort identified the need for a robust core model of
organisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable
mathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a
situation and context aware multivalent computational logic for active
self-organizing networks, Wandering Logic Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale
dynamic category theory, Memory Evolutive Systems (MES), hence WLIMES. This is
presented to the modeller via a formal augmented reality language as a first
step towards practical modelling and simulation of multi-level living systems.
Initial work focuses on the design and implementation of this visual language
