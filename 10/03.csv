dynamic information from data, in the form of spatial modes and their
associated frequencies and growth/decay rates. DMD can be considered as a
numerical approximation to the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear
operator defined for (nonlinear) dynamical systems. This work proposes a new
criterion to estimate the accuracy of DMD on a mode-by-mode basis, by
estimating how closely each individual DMD eigenfunction approximates the
corresponding Koopman eigenfunction. This approach does not require any prior
knowledge of the system dynamics or the true Koopman spectral decomposition.
The method may be applied to extensions of DMD (i.e., extended/kernel DMD),
which are applicable to a wider range of problems. The accuracy criterion is
first validated against the true error with a synthetic system for which the
true Koopman spectral decomposition is known. We next demonstrate how this
proposed accuracy criterion can be used to assess the performance of various
choices of kernel when using the kernel method for extended DMD. Finally, we
show that our proposed method successfully identifies modes of high accuracy
when applying DMD to data from experiments in fluids, in particular particle
image velocimetry of a cylinder wake and a canonical separated boundary layer.

important tests of the Standard Model of particle physics. Angular observables
in exclusive $b \to s\ell^+\ell^-$ processes can be particularly powerful as
they allow hadronic uncertainties to be controlled. Amongst the exclusive
processes that have been studied by experiments, the decay $\Lambda_b\to
\Lambda\ell^+\ell^-$ is unique in that the $\Lambda_b$ baryon can be produced
polarised. In this paper, we derive an expression for the angular distribution
of the $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda\ell^+\ell^-$ decay for the case where the
$\Lambda_b$ baryon is produced polarised. This extends the number of angular
observables in this decay from 10 to 34. Standard Model expectations for the
new observables are provided and the sensitivity of the observables is explored
under a variety of new physics models. At low-hadronic recoil, four of the new
observables have a new short distance dependence that is absent in the
unpolarised case. The remaining observables depend on the same short distance
contributions as the unpolarised observables, but with different dependence on
hadronic form-factors. These relations provide possibilities for novel tests of
the SM that could be carried out with the data that will become available at
the LHC or a future $e^+e^-$ collider.

universe, bouncing at a finite minimum, by the device of adding a comoving
'ghost' field with negative energy density. In the absence of a cosmological
constant, an increase in entropy, injected at the start of each cycle, causes
an increase in the volume maxima, increasing approach to flatness, falling
velocities and vorticities, and growing anisotropy at the expansion maxima of
successive cycles. We find that the velocities oscillate rapidly as they evolve
and change logarithmically in time relative to the expansion volume. When the
conservation of momentum and angular momentum constraints are imposed, the
spatial components of these velocities fall to smaller values when the entropy
density increases, and vice versa. Isotropisation is found to occur when a
positive cosmological constant is added because the sequence of oscillations
ends and the dynamics expand forever, evolving towards a quasi de Sitter
asymptote with constant velocity amplitudes. The case of a single cycle of
evolution with a negative cosmological constant added is also studied.

investigate the spatial evolution of the X-ray emitting electron distribution
and therefore to study the transport effects on energetic electrons during
solar flares. We study the energy dependence of the energetic electron
scattering mean free path in the solar corona. We use the imaging spectroscopy
technique with RHESSI to study the evolution of energetic electrons
distribution in different part of the magnetic loop during the 2004 May 21
flare. These observations are compared with the radio observations of the
gyrosynchrotron radiation of the same flare by Kuznetsov and Kontar (2015), and
with the predictions of the diffusive transport model described by Kontar et
al. (2014). The X-ray analysis shows a trapping of energetic electrons in the
corona and a spectral hardening of the energetic electron distribution between
the top of the loop and the footpoints. Coronal trapping of electrons is
stronger for the radio-emitting electrons than for the X-ray-emitting
electrons. These observations can be explained by the diffusive transport model
derived by Kontar et al. (2014). We show that the combination of X-ray and
radio diagnostics is a powerful tool to study electron transport in the solar
corona in different energy domains. We show that the diffusive transport model
can explain our observations; and in the range 25-500 keV, the electron
scattering mean free path decreases with electron energy. We can estimate for
the first time the scattering mean free path dependence on energy in the
corona.

binary star systems with physical and orbital charac- teristics similar to
those of the population of known wide binary stars with exoplanets. As
secondary goal we analyse the possible consequences on the stability of a
hypothetical planetary system orbiting one of the stellar components. Methods.
We numerically reproduced the temporal evolution of a sample of 3 * 10 5 binary
star systems disturbed by the Galactic potential and passing stars in an
environment similar to the solar neighbourhood. Results. Our results show that
the dynamical evolution of the population of wide binary stars with exoplanets
in the solar neigh- bourhood is modelled by the process of disruption of binary
star systems induced by the Galaxy. We found that this process depends mainly
on the separation between both stars, whereas it is almost independent of the
initial orbital configuration. Moreover, our calcu- lations are in agreement
with the results of previous works regarding the indirect influence of the
Galaxy on the stability of planetary systems in wide binary stars. However, the
effects on the planetary region show a dependence on the initial configuration
of binary stars. Finally, we obtain an indirect test of the impulse
approximation model for dynamical studies of binary star systems.

of how one ought to design a protocol for reaching consensus. However, in
instances where the underlying decision space is too large or complex for
ordinal voting, standard voting methods of social choice may be impractical.
How then can we design a mechanism - preferably decentralized, simple,
scalable, and not requiring any special knowledge of the decision space - to
reach consensus? We propose sequential deliberation as a natural solution to
this problem. In this iterative method, successive pairs of agents bargain over
the decision space using the previous decision as a disagreement alternative.
We describe the general method and analyze the quality of its outcome when the
space of preferences define a median graph. We show that sequential
deliberation finds a 1.208- approximation to the optimal social cost on such
graphs, coming very close to this value with only a small constant number of
agents sampled from the population. We also show lower bounds on simpler
classes of mechanisms to justify our design choices. We further show that
sequential deliberation is ex-post Pareto efficient and has truthful reporting
as an equilibrium of the induced extensive form game. We finally show that for
general metric spaces, the second moment of of the distribution of social cost
of the outcomes produced by sequential deliberation is also bounded.

of the robots, a priori unknown, may turn out to be unreliable. The graph is
weighted and each node is assigned a deadline. The exploration is successful if
each node of the graph is visited before its deadline by a reliable robot. The
edge weight corresponds to the time needed by a robot to traverse the edge.
Given the number of robots which may crash, is it possible to design an
algorithm, which will always guarantee the exploration, independently of the
choice of the subset of unreliable robots by the adversary? We find the optimal
time, during which the graph may be explored. Our approach permits to find the
maximal number of robots, which may turn out to be unreliable, and the graph is
still guaranteed to be explored.
  We concentrate on line graphs and rings, for which we give positive results.
We start with the case of the collections involving only reliable robots. We
give algorithms finding optimal times needed for exploration when the robots
are assigned to fixed initial positions as well as when such starting positions
may be determined by the algorithm. We extend our consideration to the case
when some number of robots may be unreliable. Our most surprising result is
that solving the line exploration problem with robots at given positions, which
may involve crash-faulty ones, is NP-hard. The same problem has polynomial
solutions for a ring and for the case when the initial robots' positions on the
line are arbitrary.
  The exploration problem is shown to be NP-hard for star graphs, even when the
team consists of only two reliable robots.

failure tolerance of networks, with high connectivity being a desirable
feature. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the problem of
identifying critical nodes in large-scale networks, with algebraic connectivity
(the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian) as the chosen metric.
Employing a graph-embedding technique, we reduce the class of considered
weight-balanced graphs to spatial networks with uniformly distributed nodes and
nearest-neighbors communication topologies. Through a continuum approximation,
we consider the Laplace operator on a manifold (with the Neumann boundary
condition) as the limiting case of the graph Laplacian. We then reduce the
critical node set identification problem to that of finding a ball of fixed
radius, whose removal minimizes the second (Neumann) eigenvalue of the Laplace
operator on the residual domain. This leads us to consider two functional and
nested optimization problems. Resorting to the min-max theorem, we first treat
the problem of determining the second smallest eigenvalue for a fixed domain by
minimizing an energy functional. We then obtain a projected gradient flow that
converges to the set of points satisfying the KKT conditions and prove that the
only locally asymptotically stable critical point is the second eigenfunction
of the Laplace operator. Building on these results, we consider the critical
ball identification problem and construct a dynamics to converge asymptotically
to these points. Finally, we provide a characterization of the location of
critical nodes (for infinitesimally-small balls) as those points which belong
to the nodal set of the second eigenfunction of the Laplace operator.

Hamiltonian. We establish a resilience version of this result. In particular,
we show that the random graph process almost surely creates a sequence of

Images are displayed on designated monitors that cannot be positioned optimally
due to sterility and spatial constraints. This indirect visualization causes
potential occlusion, hinders hand-eye coordination, leads to increased
procedure duration and surgeon load. Methods: We propose a virtual monitor
system that displays medical images in a mixed reality visualization using
optical see-through head-mounted displays. The system streams high-resolution
medical images from any modality to the head-mounted display in real-time that
are blended with the surgical site. It allows for mixed reality visualization
of images in head-, world-, or body-anchored mode and can thus be adapted to
specific procedural needs. Results: For typical image sizes, the proposed
system exhibits an average end-to-end delay and refresh rate of 214 +- 30 ms
and 41:4 +- 32:0 Hz, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed virtual monitor
system is capable of real-time mixed reality visualization of medical images.
In future, we seek to conduct first pre-clinical studies to quantitatively
assess the impact of the system on standard image guided procedures.

message out of $K$ messages from $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases
where a cache-enabled user (retriever) of cache-size $M$ possesses side
information in the form of full messages that are partially known to the
databases. In this model, the user and the databases engage in a two-phase
scheme, namely, the prefetching phase where the user acquires side information
and the retrieval phase where the user downloads desired information. In the
prefetching phase, the user receives $m_n$ full messages from the $n$th
database, under the cache memory size constraint $\sum_{n=1}^N m_n \leq M$. In
the retrieval phase, the user wishes to retrieve a message such that no
individual database learns anything about the identity of the desired message.
In addition, the identities of the side information messages that the user did
not prefetch from a database must remain private against that database. Since
the side information provided by each database in the prefetching phase is
known by the providing database and the side information must be kept private
against the remaining databases, we coin this model as \textit{partially known
private side information}. We characterize the capacity of the PIR with
partially known private side information to be
$C=\left(1+\frac{1}{N}+\cdots+\frac{1}{N^{K-M-1}}\right)^{-1}=\frac{1-\frac{1}{N}}{1-(\frac{1}{N})^{K-M}}$.
Interestingly, this result is the same if none of the databases knows any of
the prefetched side information, i.e., when the side information is obtained
externally, a problem posed by Kadhe et al. and settled by Chen-Wang-Jafar
recently. Thus, our result implies that there is no loss in using the same
databases for both prefetching and retrieval phases.

adversarial examples targeting at a neural network-based policy are not
effective for the frame prediction model. By comparing the action distribution
produced by a policy from processing the current observed frame to the action
distribution produced by the same policy from processing the predicted frame
from the action-conditioned frame prediction module, we can detect the presence
of adversarial examples. Beyond detecting the presence of adversarial examples,
our method allows the agent to continue performing the task using the predicted
frame when the agent is under attack. We evaluate the performance of our
algorithm using five games in Atari 2600. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed defense mechanism achieves favorable performance against baseline
algorithms in detecting adversarial examples and in earning rewards when the

galactic and cluster halos. There is no clear consensus on its origin. Such gas
could be uplifted from the central galaxy by galactic or AGN winds.
Alternatively, it could form in situ by thermal instability. Fragmentation into
a multi-phase medium has previously been shown in hydrodynamic simulations to
take place once $t_\mathrm{cool}/t_\mathrm{ff}$, the ratio of the cooling time
to the free-fall time, falls below a threshold value. Here, we use 3D
plane-parallel MHD simulations to investigate the influence of magnetic fields.
We find that because magnetic tension suppresses buoyant oscillations of
condensing gas, it destabilizes all scales below $l_\mathrm{A}^\mathrm{cool}
\sim v_\mathrm{A} t_\mathrm{cool}$, enhancing thermal instability. This effect
is surprisingly independent of magnetic field orientation or cooling curve
shape, and sets in even at very low magnetic field strengths. Magnetic fields
critically modify both the amplitude and morphology of thermal instability,
with $\delta \rho/\rho \propto \beta^{-1/2}$, where $\beta$ is the ratio of
thermal to magnetic pressure. In galactic halos, magnetic fields can render gas
throughout the entire halo thermally unstable, and may be an attractive
explanation for the ubiquity of cold gas, even in the halos of passive,
quenched galaxies.

isolation of their environment, but grow through accretion of gas. In addition,
while an age can be defined for a star forming region, the ages of individual
stars in the region will vary. We show how the combined effect of a
protostellar age spread, a consequence of sustained star formation in the
molecular cloud, and time-varying protostellar accretion for individual
protostars can explain the observed luminosity spread. We use a global MHD
simulation including a sub-scale sink particle model of a star forming region

to compute stellar evolution models for each star, incorporating a model of how
the accretion energy is distributed to the disk, radiated away at the accretion
shock, or incorporated into the outer layers of the protostar. Using a modelled
cluster age of 5 Myr we naturally reproduce the lumi- nosity spread and find
good agreement with observations of the Collinder 69 cluster, and the Orion
Nebular Cluster. It is shown how stars in binary and multiple systems can be
externally forced creating recurrent episodic accretion events. We find that in
a realistic global molecular cloud model massive stars build up mass over
relatively long time-scales. This leads to an important conceptual change
compared to the classic picture of non-accreting stellar evolution segmented in
to low-mass Hayashi tracks and high-mass Henyey tracks.

its Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum has narrow AGN emission lines that
exhibit a velocity offset of 69 km s$^{-1}$ relative to systemic. To determine
the nature of the galaxy and its velocity-offset emission lines, we observed
SDSS J1354+1327 with Chandra/ACIS, Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3,
Apache Point Observatory optical longslit spectroscopy, and Keck/OSIRIS
integral-field spectroscopy. We find a ~10 kpc cone of photoionized gas south
of the galaxy center and a ~1 kpc semi-spherical front of shocked gas, which is
responsible for the velocity offset in the emission lines, north of the galaxy
center. We interpret these two outflows as the result of two separate AGN
accretion events; the first AGN outburst created the southern outflow, and then
$<10^5$ yrs later the second AGN outburst launched the northern shock front.
SDSS J1354+1327 is the galaxy with the strongest evidence for an AGN that has

with an extension of the Lya emission in the SHARDS F823W17 and MUSE

transfer scheme based on the truncated moment formalism. While we fix the mass
ratio of the black hole to the neutron star to be 4 and the dimensionless spin
parameter of the black hole to be 0.75, the equations of state for
finite-temperature neutron-star matter are varied. The hot accretion disk
formed after tidal disruption of the neutron star emits a copious amount of
neutrinos with the peak total luminosity ~1--3x10^53 erg s^(-1) via thermal
pair production and subsequent electron/positron captures on free nucleons.
Nevertheless, the neutrino irradiation does not modify significantly the
electron fraction of the dynamical ejecta from the neutrinoless
beta-equilibrium value at zero temperature of initial neutron stars. The mass
of the wind component driven by neutrinos from the remnant disk is negligible
compared to the very neutron-rich dynamical component, throughout our
simulations performed until a few tens milliseconds after the onset of merger,
for the models considered in this study. These facts suggest that the ejecta
from black hole-neutron star binaries are very neutron rich and are expected to
accommodate strong r-process nucleosynthesis, unless magnetic or viscous
processes contribute substantially to the mass ejection from the disk. We also
find that the peak neutrino luminosity does not necessarily increase as the
disk mass increases, because tidal disruption of a compact neutron star can
result in a remnant disk with a small mass but high temperature.

advocated as a possible component of dark matter. These fields can form compact
regular structures known as boson stars, or---in the presence of
horizons---give rise to nontrivial time-dependent scalar hair and a stationary
geometry. Because these fields can be coherent over large spatial extents,
their interaction with ""regular"" matter can lead to very peculiar effects, most
notably resonances. Here we study the motion of stars in a background
describing black holes surrounded by non-axially symmetric scalar field
profiles. By analyzing the system in a weak-field approach, we find that the
presence of a scalar field gives rise to secular effects akin to ones existing
in planetary and accretion disks. Particularly, the existence of resonances
between the orbiting stars and the scalar field may enable angular momentum
exchange between them, providing mechanisms similar to planetary migration.
Additionally, these mechanisms may allow \textit{floating orbits}, which are
stable radiating orbits. We also show, in the full relativistic case, that
these effects also appear when there is a direct coupling between the scalar
field and the stellar matter, which can arise due to the presence of a scalar
core in the star or in alternative theories of gravity.

To gain new insights into this phenomenon, we have undertaken a photometric

of old GCs, where MPs have been identified, but with significantly younger
ages. Nine clusters in the Magellanic Clouds with ages between $\sim$ 1.5-11

populations in all clusters older than 6 Gyr and we add NGC 1978 to the group
of clusters for which MPs have been identified. With an age of $\sim$ 2 Gyr,
NGC 1978 is the youngest cluster known to host chemical abundance spreads found
to date. We do not detect evident star-to-star variations for slightly younger
massive clusters ($\sim$ 1.7 Gyr), thus pointing towards an unexpected age

the formation of MPs is not restricted to the early Universe and that GCs and

axion, the quantum state evolves so that the expectation value over it starts
to deviate from the classical solution. The time-scale of this process defines
the quantum break-time. For the hypothetical dark matter axion field in our
Universe, we show that quantum break-time exceeds the age of the Universe by
many orders of magnitude. This conclusion is independent of specific properties
of the axion model. Thus, experimental searches based on the classical
approximation of the oscillating cosmic axion field are fully justified.
Additionally, we point out that the distinction of classical nonlinearities and
true quantum effects is crucial for calculating the quantum break-time in any
system. Our analysis can also be applied to other types of dark matter that are
described as classical fluids in the mean field approximation.

Although the initial net energy ($\sim 2$ Bethe) of the neutrino-heated ejecta
barely equals the binding energy of the envelope, $11\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ of
hydrogen are still expelled with an energy of $0.23$ Bethe. We find no
significant mixing and only a modest BH kick and spin, but speculate that
stronger effects could occur for slightly more energetic explosions or
progenitors with less tightly bound envelopes.

SF history shapes/spatial uniformity are linked, such that higher $B/T$s
correlate with ""inside-out growth"" and central specific SFRs that peaked above
the global average for all starforming galaxies at that epoch. Conversely, the

this work provides a proof-of-concept for future efforts to refine or refute
it: JWST, WFIRST, and the 30-m class telescopes will routinely produce data

representative mass, redshift, SFR, and environmental regimes---will be ripe

sample, we find $\Omega_m=0.307\pm0.012$ and $w = -1.026\pm0.041$ for the wCDM

and local H0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of
dark energy to date: $w0 = -1.007\pm 0.089$ and $wa = -0.222 \pm0.407$ for the
w0waCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an
analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of $2\times$ in
the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and
stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find the systematic uncertainties in our
measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical
uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift

dark energy.

classifications, in a previous paper (I) we demonstrated that photometrically
classified SNe can be used to infer unbiased cosmological parameters by using a
Bayesian methodology that marginalizes over core-collapse (CC) SN
contamination. Our sample contains nearly twice as many SNe as the largest
previous SN Ia compilation. Combining SNe with Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) constraints from Planck, we measure the dark energy equation of state
parameter $w$ to be -0.989$\pm$0.057 (stat$+$sys). If $w$ evolves with redshift
as $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$, we find $w_0 = -0.912 \pm 0.149$ and $w_a =$
-0.513$\pm$0.826. These results are consistent with cosmological parameters
from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis and the Pantheon sample. We try four
different photometric classification priors for Pan-STARRS SNe and two
alternate ways of modeling CC SN contamination, finding that no variant gives a
$w$ differing by more than 2% from the baseline measurement. The systematic
uncertainty on $w$ due to marginalizing over CC SN contamination,
$\sigma_w^{\textrm{CC}} = 0.012$, is the third-smallest source of systematic
uncertainty in this work. We find limited (1.6$\sigma$) evidence for evolution
of the SN color-luminosity relation with redshift, a possible systematic that
could constitute a significant uncertainty in future high-$z$ analyses. Our
data provide one of the best current constraints on $w$, demonstrating that
samples with $\sim$5% CC SN contamination can give competitive cosmological
constraints when the contaminating distribution is marginalized over in a
Bayesian framework.

nuclear fuel, produced for experiments on breeder reactors, with an
electrochemical process. The metallic waste produced is to be cast into ingots
and the salt waste further processed to form a ceramic waste form for disposal
in a mined repository. However, alternative disposal pathways for metallic and
salt waste streams are being investigated that may reduce the processing
complexity. As summarized here, performance assessments analyzing the direct
disposal the salt waste demonstrate that both mined repositories in salt and
deep boreholes in basement crystalline rock can easily accommodate the salt
waste. Also summarized here is an analysis of the feasibility of transporting
the salt waste in a proposed vessel. The vessel is viable for transport to and
disposal in a generic mined repository in salt or deep borehole but a portion
of the salt waste would need to be diluted for disposal in the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant. The generally positive results continue to demonstrate the
feasibility of direct disposal of salt waste after electrochemical processing

the individual risk and severity of the disease is exceedingly difficult and
could be extremely expensive. Economic consequences, infrastructure and service
disruption, as well as the recovery speed, are just a few of the many
dimensions along which to quantify the effect of an epidemic on society's
fabric. Here, we extend the concept of resilience to characterize epidemics in
structured populations, by defining the system-wide critical functionality that
combines an individual's risk of getting the disease (disease attack rate) and
the disruption to the system's functionality (human mobility deterioration). By
studying both conceptual and data-driven models, we show that the integrated
consideration of individual risks and societal disruptions under resilience
assessment framework provides an insightful picture of how an epidemic might
impact society. In particular, containment interventions intended for a
straightforward reduction of the risk may have net negative impact on the
system by slowing down the recovery of basic societal functions. The presented
study operationalizes the resilience framework, providing a more nuanced and
comprehensive approach for optimizing containment schemes and mitigation
policies in the case of epidemic outbreaks.

timing observations by Maciejewski et al. (2016) and Patra et al. (2017) find a
decreasing period with $P/|\dot{P}| = 3.2\textrm{ Myr}$. This has been
interpreted as evidence of either orbital decay due to tidal dissipation or a
long term oscillation of the apparent period due to apsidal precession. Here we
consider the possibility that it is orbital decay. We show that the parameters
of the host star are consistent with either a $M_\ast \simeq 1.3 M_\odot$ main
sequence star or a $M_\ast \simeq 1.2 M_\odot$ subgiant. We find that if the
star is on the main sequence, the tidal dissipation is too inefficient to
explain the observed $\dot{P}$. However, if it is a subgiant, the tidal
dissipation is significantly enhanced due to nonlinear wave breaking of the
dynamical tide near the star's center. The subgiant models have a tidal quality
factor $Q_\ast'\simeq 2\times10^5$ and an orbital decay rate that agrees well
with the observed $\dot{P}$. It would also explain why the planet survived for
$\simeq 3\textrm{ Gyr}$ while the star was on the main sequence and yet is now
inspiraling on a 3 Myr timescale. Although this suggests that we are witnessing
the last $\sim 0.1\%$ of the planet's life, the probability of such a detection
is a few percent given the observed sample of $\simeq 30$ hot Jupiters in

The design method is general enough to cover a wide spectrum of systems from

Lyapunov-Krasovski functionals and making use of the free-connection weighting
matrices, new delay-dependent conditions guaranteeing the existence of linear

derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, a sliding mode

converge to predefined sliding surfaces in a finite time and remain there for
all subsequent times. This paper also proposes an adaptive sliding mode
controller design method which applies to cases in which mode-dependent

in terms of LMI feasibility problems. Numerical examples are given to

prominent observable signatures which makes them especially relevant to
relatively low signal-to-noise ratio measurements such as gravitational wave
detections. An indefinitely growing instability usually renders a theory
unphysical, hence a desirable instability should also come with underlying
physical machinery that stops the growth at finite values, i.e. regularization
mechanisms. The prototypical gravity theory that presents such an instability
is the spontaneous scalarization phenomena of scalar-tensor theories, which
feature a tachyonic instability. We identify the regularization mechanisms in
this theory, and show that they can be utilized to regularize other
instabilities as well. Namely, we present theories where spontaneous growth is
triggered by a ghost rather than a tachyon, and numerically calculate
stationary solutions of scalarized neutron stars in these theories. We
speculate on the possibility of regularizing known divergent instabilities in
certain gravity theories using our findings, and discuss alternative theories
of gravitation where regularized instabilities may be present. Even though we
study many specific examples, our main point is the recognition of regularized
instabilities as a common theme and unifying mechanism in a vast array of
gravity theories.

applications. Comparing to classical batch-mode clustering, there are two key
challenges in stream clustering: (i) Given that input data are changing
continuously, how to incrementally update clustering results efficiently? (ii)
Given that clusters continuously evolve with the evolution of data, how to
capture the cluster evolution activities? Unfortunately, most of existing
stream clustering algorithms can neither update the cluster result in real time
nor track the evolution of clusters.
  In this paper, we propose an stream clustering algorithm EDMStream by
exploring the Evolution of Density Mountain. The density mountain is used to
abstract the data distribution, the changes of which indicate data distribution
evolution. We track the evolution of clusters by monitoring the changes of
density mountains. We further provide efficient data structures and filtering
schemes to ensure the update of density mountains in real time, which makes
online clustering possible. The experimental results on synthetic and real
datasets show that, comparing to the state-of-the-art stream clustering
algorithms, e.g., D-Stream, DenStream, DBSTREAM and MR-Stream, our algorithm
can response to a cluster update much faster (say 7-15x faster than the best of
the competitors) and at the same time achieve comparable cluster quality.
Furthermore, EDMStream can successfully capture the cluster evolution

features across categories and polymerized features within classes has always
been at the core of many computer vision tasks, specially for large-scale

number of classes could be at million scale. In this paper, we address this
problem based on the simple intuition that the cosine distance of features in
high-dimensional space should be close enough within one class and far away
across categories. To this end, we proposed the congenerous cosine (COCO)
algorithm to simultaneously optimize the cosine similarity among data. It
inherits the softmax property to make inter-class features discriminative as
well as shares the idea of class centroid in metric learning. Unlike previous
work where the center is a temporal, statistical variable within one mini-batch

inner-class features to enforce them polymerized around the network truncus.
COCO is bundled with discriminative training and learned end-to-end with stable
convergence. Experiments on five benchmarks have been extensively conducted to
verify the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale classification

photodetection in these extremely short-period superlattices. We observe a
linear dependence of the photocurrent with the incident illumination power,
which confirms the insensitivity of the intersubband process to surface states
and highlights how architectures featuring large surface-to-volume ratios are

under the assumption of local stationarity, which allows us to gain in
flexibility. Adopting a local censored likelihood approach, inference is made
on a fine spatial grid, and local estimation is performed by taking advantage
of distributed computing resources and the embarrassingly parallel nature of
this estimation procedure. The local model is efficiently fitted at all grid
points, and uncertainty is measured using a block bootstrap procedure. An
extensive simulation study shows that our approach can adequately capture
complex, non-stationary dependencies, while our study of U.S. winter
precipitation data reveals interesting differences in local tail structures
over space, which has important implications on regional risk assessment of
extreme precipitation events.

aid to many NLP tasks, such as entailment, coreference, relation extraction,

learning hypernyms from unlabeled text. Existing unsupervised methods either do
not scale to large vocabularies or yield unacceptably poor accuracy. This paper
introduces distributional inclusion vector embedding (DIVE), a
simple-to-implement unsupervised method of hypernym discovery via per-word
non-negative vector embeddings which preserve the inclusion property of word
contexts in a low-dimensional and interpretable space. In experimental
evaluations more comprehensive than any previous literature of which we are
aware-evaluating on 11 datasets using multiple existing as well as newly

performance, using a much more compact word representation, and yielding many

optimization results for one multi-body potential on a range of vector
instruction sets, targeting both CPUs and accelerators like the Intel Xeon Phi.
Parallelization of MD simulations is well-studied; by contrast, vectorization
is relatively unexplored. Given the prevalence and power of modern vector
units, exploiting them is imperative for high performance software. When
running on a highly parallel machine, any improvement to the scalar performance
is paid back in hundreds or thousands of saved core hours. Vectorization is
already commonly used in the optimization or pair potentials; multi-body
potentials pose new, unique challenges. Indeed, their optimization pushes the
boundaries of current compilers, forcing us to use explicit vectorization
techniques for now. In this study, we add an optimized implementation of
Tersoff potential to the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package. To
reduce the burden of explicit vectorization, we abstract from the specific
vector instruction set and desired precision: From one algorithm, we get
optimized implementations for many platforms, from SSE4.2 to AVX512, and the
Intel Xeon Phi. We compare the kernels across different architectures, and
determine suitable architecture-dependent parameters. Our optimizations benefit
any architecture, but have a disproportionate effect on the Intel Xeon Phi,
which beats the CPU (2xE5-2650) after optimization.

sizes and magnitudes, due to the non-negligible fraction of unrecognized blends
in ground-based data, even with the excellent typical seeing of the HSC survey
(0.58"" in the $i$-band). Using these simulations, we detect and remove the
impact of selection biases due to the correlation of weights and the quantities
used to define the sample (S/N and apparent size) with the lensing shear. We
quantify and remove galaxy property-dependent multiplicative and additive shear
biases that are intrinsic to our shear estimation method, including a $\sim 10$
per cent-level multiplicative bias due to the impact of nearby galaxies and
unrecognized blends. Finally, we check the sensitivity of our shear calibration
estimates to other cuts made on the simulated samples, and find that the
changes in shear calibration are well within the requirements for HSC weak
lensing analysis. Overall, the simulations suggest that the weak lensing
multiplicative biases in the first-year HSC shear catalog are controlled at the

explicit characterization of the convergence rate of Gradient Descent (GD)
using the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. The same type of problems under the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are, however, poorly
understood. For instance, simple but important non-strongly-convex consensus
problems have not yet being analyzed, especially concerning the dependency of
the convergence rate on the graph topology. Recently, for a non-strongly-convex
consensus problem, a connection between distributed ADMM and lifted Markov
chains was proposed, followed by a conjecture that ADMM is faster than GD by a
square root factor in its convergence time, in close analogy to the mixing
speedup achieved by lifting several Markov chains. Nevertheless, a proof of
such a claim is is still lacking. Here we provide a full characterization of
the convergence of distributed over-relaxed ADMM for the same type of consensus
problem in terms of the topology of the underlying graph. Our results provide
explicit formulas for optimal parameter selection in terms of the second
largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of the graph's random walk. Another
consequence of our results is a proof of the aforementioned conjecture, which
interestingly, we show it is valid for any graph, even the ones whose random

taken from 234 days between June 2016 to February 2017. The primary cosmic-ray
energy is determined with a maximum likelihood approach using the particle
density as a function of distance to the shower core. Introducing quality cuts
to isolate events with shower cores landing on the array, the reconstructed
energy distribution is unfolded iteratively. The measured all-particle spectrum
is consistent with a broken power law with an index of $-2.49\pm0.01$ prior to
a break at $(45.7\pm0.1$) TeV, followed by an index of $-2.71\pm0.01$. The
spectrum also respresents a single measurement that spans the energy range

detector response, the energy scale and angular resolution are validated by
observation of the cosmic ray Moon shadow's dependence on energy.

  Here we develop a method for reconstructing an underlying network of genomic

With the increase of the hot bath temperature, the population is inverted and
lasing light comes out. However, we notice that if the hot bath temperature
keeps increasing, the atomic decay rate is also enhanced, which weakens the
lasing gain. As a result, another critical point appears at a very high
temperature of the hot bath, after which the output light become thermal
radiation again. To avoid this double-threshold behavior, we introduce a
four-level heat engine model, where the atomic decay rate does not depend on

computational infeasibility of handling an entire dataset at once, 2) existence
of heterogeneously distributed corruption, and 3) difficulty in corruption

distributed robust regression approaches, both of which can concurrently
address all the above challenges. Specifically, the distributed algorithm
optimizes the regression coefficients of each data block via heuristic hard
thresholding and combines all the estimates in a distributed robust
consolidation. Furthermore, an online version of the distributed algorithm is
proposed to incrementally update the existing estimates with new incoming data.
We also prove that our algorithms benefit from strong robustness guarantees in

Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we can indeed describe a canonical evolution

both by a modular Hamiltonian and a physical Hamiltonian, the latter being
determined by its functoriality properties. This allows us to make an intrinsic
analysis, extending our QFT index formula, but without any a priori given
dynamics; the associated incremental free energy is related to the logarithm of
the Jones index and is thus quantised. This leads to a general lower bound for
the incremental free energy of an irreversible quantum channel which is half of

considered as a fruitful technique of studying the theory. Our present topic of
discussion involves an analogous approach of studying quantum theory. For our
purpose, we have deviated from the usual procedure of assessing monogamous
nature of quantum correlations in standard Bell-CHSH scenario. We have
considered correlations arising in a quantum network involving independent
sources. Precisely speaking, we have analyzed monogamy of nonbilocal
correlations by deriving a relation restricting marginals. Interestingly,
restrictions constraining distribution of nonbilocal correlations remain same
irrespective of whether inputs of the nodal observers are kept fixed(in
different bilocal networks) while studying nonbilocal nature of marginal
correlations.

should be not only detected but also accelerated. Specifically, it is assumed
that the sequentially collected observations are responses to treatments

pre-change and post-change distributions of the responses, but also influence
when the change happens. The problem is to find a treatment assignment rule and
a stopping rule that minimize the expected total number of observations subject

to this problem is obtained under a general Markovian change-point model.
Moreover, an alternative procedure is proposed, whose applicability is not
restricted to Markovian change-point models and whose design requires minimal

is shown to achieve the optimal performance in an asymptotic sense. Finally,
its performance is found in two simulation studies to be close to the optimal,

independent way. The goal of this paper is to test these relations with extreme
equations of state at supranuclear densities constrained to satisfy only a
handful of generic, physically sensible conditions. By requiring that the
equation of state be (i) barotropic and (ii) its associated speed of sound be
real, we construct a piecewise function that matches a tabulated equation of
state at low densities, while matching a stiff equation of state parametrized
by its sound speed in the high-density region. We show that the I-Love-Q
relations hold to 1 percent with this class of equations of state, even in the
extreme case where the speed of sound becomes superluminal and independently of
the transition density. We also find further support for the interpretation of
the I-Love-Q relations as an emergent symmetry due to the nearly constant
eccentricity of isodensity contours inside the star. These results reinforce
the robustness of the I-Love-Q relations against our current incomplete picture
of physics at supranuclear densities, while strengthening our confidence in the
applicability of these relations in neutron star astrophysics.

directly related to probing the system's hydrodynamic sound modes. The

purely diffusion-like, linearized gravitational waves at the horizon of a
single-sided black hole with specific regularity-enforced imaginary values of
frequency and momentum. In two-derivative bulk theories, this horizon
""diffusion"" can be related to late-time momentum diffusion via a simple
relation, which ceases to hold in higher-derivative theories. We then show that
the same values of imaginary frequency and momentum follow from a dispersion
relation of a hydrodynamic sound mode. The frequency, momentum and group
velocity give the holographic Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity.
Moreover, at this special point along the sound dispersion relation curve, the
residue of the retarded longitudinal stress-energy tensor two-point function
vanishes. This establishes a direct link between a hydrodynamic sound mode at
an analytically continued, imaginary momentum and the holographic butterfly
effect. Furthermore, our results imply that infinitely strongly coupled,
large-$N_c$ holographic theories exhibit properties similar to classical dilute
gasses; there, late-time equilibration and early-time scrambling are also
controlled by the same dynamics.

We attribute this to a specific combination of intrinsic conformational bend of

geometric model of the twist-bend phase for these materials with the molecules

the discontinuous feature was produced by a planetary companion to the binary
lens. We find 4 degenerate triple-lens solution classes, each composed of a
pair of solutions according to the well-known wide/close planetary degeneracy.
One of these solution classes is excluded due to its relatively poor fit. For
the remaining three pairs of solutions, the most-likely primary mass is about
$M_1\sim 0.7\,M_\odot$ while the planet is a super-Jupiter. In all cases the
system lies in the Galactic disk, about half-way toward the Galactic bulge.
However, in one of these three solution classes, the secondary of the binary
system is a low-mass brown dwarf, with relative mass ratios (1 : 0.03 : 0.003),
while in the two others the masses of the binary components are comparable.
These two possibilities can be distinguished in about 2024 when the measured

when we take the $2d$ limit in which $r\to 0$. The $2d$ limit depends on how
the mass parameters are scaled as $r\to 0$, and often vacua become infinitely
distant in the $2d$ limit, leading to a direct sum of different $2d$ theories.
For generic mass parameters, when we take the same limit on both sides of a
duality, we obtain $2d$ dualities (between gauge theories and/or
Landau-Ginzburg theories) that pass all the usual tests. However, when there
are non-compact branches the discussion is subtle because the metric on the
moduli space, which is not controlled by supersymmetry, plays an important role
in the low-energy dynamics after compactification. Generally speaking, for IR
dualities of gauge theories, we conjecture that dualities involving non-compact
Higgs branches survive. On the other hand when there is a non-compact Coulomb
branch on at least one side of the duality, the duality fails already when the
$3d$ theories are compactified on a circle. Using the valid reductions we
reproduce many known $2d$ IR dualities, giving further evidence for their

either one to determine the other. In this work we discuss how one can simply
examine the one-particle density matrix to faithfully determine whether the
spin magnetization density vector field is collinear, coplanar, or noncoplanar.
For single determinants, this test suffices to distinguish collinear
determinants which are eigenfunctions of $\hat{S}_{\hat{n}}$ from noncollinear
determinants which are not. We also point out the close relationship between
noncoplanar magnetism on the one hand and complex conjugation symmetry breaking
on the other. Finally, we use these ideas to classify the various ways single
determinant wave functions break and respect symmetries of the Hamiltonian in

percolation process that matches infrastructures better than previous models by
allowing some nodes to survive when their interdependent neighbors fail. We
consider a node-to-link failure propagation mechanism and establish ""weak""
interdependence across layers via a tolerance parameter $\alpha$ which
quantifies the likelihood that a node survives when one of its interdependent
neighbors fails. We measure the robustness of any individual layer by the final
size of its giant component. Analytical and numerical results show that weak
interdependence produces a striking phenomenon: layers at different positions
within the multilayer system experience distinct percolation transitions.
Especially, layers with high super degree values percolate in an abrupt manner,
while those with low super degree values exhibit both continuous and abrupt
transitions. This novel phenomenon we call \emph{mixed percolation transitions}
has significant implications for network robustness. Previous results that do
not consider cascade tolerance and layer super degree may be under- or
over-estimating the vulnerability of real systems. Moreover, since $\alpha$
represents a generic measure of various risk management strategies used to
buffer infrastructure assets from cascades, our model reveals how nodal
protection activities influence failure dynamics in interdependent, multilayer
systems.

bimodal, with one sharp peak at approximately $20\, \rm{\mu\,Hz}$, which we
call large glitches, and a broader distribution of smaller glitches. We also
explored how the glitch activity $\dot{\nu}_{\rm{g}}$, defined as the mean
frequency increment per unit of time due to glitches, correlates with the spin
frequency $\nu$, spin-down rate $|\dot{\nu}|$, and various combinations of
these, such as energy loss rate, magnetic field, and spin-down age. It is found
that the activity is insensitive to the magnetic field and that it correlates
strongly with the energy loss rate, though magnetars deviate from the trend
defined by the rotation-powered pulsars. However, we find that a constant ratio
$\dot\nu_{\rm{g}}/|\dot\nu| = 0.010 \pm 0.001$ is consistent with the behaviour
of all rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars. This relation is dominated by
large glitches, which occur at a rate directly proportional to $|\dot{\nu}|$.

$|\dot{\nu}|$, such as the Crab pulsar and PSR B0540$-$69, which exhibit a much
smaller glitch activity, intrinsically different from each other and from the

donate a kidney are often found to be incompatible with their intended
recipients. Kidney paired donation matches one patient and his incompatible
donor with another patient and donor in the same situation for an organ
exchange. Let patient- donor pairs be the vertices of an undirected graph G,
with an edge connecting any two reciprocally compatible vertices. A matching in
G is a feasible set of paired donations. We describe various optimization
problems on kidney paired donation graphs G and the merits of each in clinical
transplantation. Because some matches are geographically undesirable, and the
expected lifespan of a transplanted kidney depends on the immunologic
concordance of donor and recipient, we weight the edges of G and seek a maximum
edge-weight matching. Unfortunately, such matchings might not have the maximum
cardinality; there is a risk of an unpredictable trade-off between the quality
and quantity of paired donations. We propose an edge-weighting of G which
guarantees that every matching with maximum weight also has maximum
cardinality, and also maximizes the number of transplants for an exceptional
subset of recipients, while reducing travel and favoring immunologic
concordance.

of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, that arrive one by one, cover the points by
balls of unit radius, so as to minimize the number of balls used. In this
paper, we work in $\mathbb{R}^d$ using Euclidean distance. The current best
competitive ratio of an online algorithm, $O(2^d d \log{d})$, is due to
Charikar et al. (2004); their algorithm is deterministic.
  (I) We give an online deterministic algorithm with competitive ratio
$O(1.321^d)$, thereby sharply improving on the earlier record by a large
exponential factor. In particular, the competitive ratios are $5$ for the plane
and $12$ for $3$-space (the previous ratios were $7$ and $21$, respectively).
For $d=3$, the ratio of our online algorithm matches the ratio of the current
best offline algorithm for the same problem due to Biniaz et al. (2017), which
is remarkable (and rather unusual).
  (II) We show that the competitive ratio of every deterministic online
algorithm (with an adaptive deterministic adversary) for Unit Covering in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $L_{2}$ norm is at least $d+1$ for every $d \geq 1$.
This greatly improves upon the previous best lower bound, $\Omega(\log{d} /
\log{\log{\log{d}}})$, due to Charikar et al. (2004).
  (III) We obtain lower bounds of $4$ and $5$ for the competitive ratio of any
deterministic algorithm for online Unit Covering in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and
respectively $\mathbb{R}^3$; the previous best lower bounds were both $3$.
  (IV) When the input points are taken from the square or hexagonal lattices in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, we give deterministic online algorithms for Unit Covering with
an optimal competitive ratio of $3$.

radial profiles of (FUV $-$ NUV), (NUV $-$ [3.6]), and (FUV $-$ [3.6]) colors
in 1931 nearby galaxies (z $<$ 0.01). The analysis of the 3.6 $\mu$m surface
brightness profiles also allows us to separate the bulge and disk components in
a quasi-automatic way, and to compare their light and color distribution with
those predicted by the chemo-spectrophotometric models for the evolution of
galaxy disks of Boissier & Prantzos (2000). The exponential disk component is
best isolated by setting an inner radial cutoff and an upper surface brightness
limit in stellar mass surface density. The best-fitting models to the measured
scale length and central surface brightness values yield distributions of spin
and circular velocity within a factor of two to those obtained via direct
kinematic measurements. We find that at a surface brightness fainter than
$\mu_{[3.6]}=20.89$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, or below $3\times 10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$
kpc$^{-2}$ in stellar mass surface density, the average specific star formation
rate for star forming and quiescent galaxies remains relatively flat with
radius. However, a large fraction of GALEX Green Valley galaxies (defined in
Bouquin et al. 2015) shows a radial decrease in specific star formation rate.
This behavior suggests that an outside-in damping mechanism, possibly related
to environmental effects, could be testimony of an early evolution of galaxies
from the blue sequence of star forming galaxies towards the red sequence of
quiescent galaxies.

attempt is made to tackle the inverse problem of synthesizing faces from their

condense till the end of free expansion phase, via condensation and
implantation. We consider relative velocities of these elements with respect to
grains as they condense and evolve at temperatures $\le$ 2000 K, use zonal
nucleosynthesis yields for three core collapse supernovae models - 15
M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)}, 20 M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)} and 25
M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)} and an ion target simulator SDTrimSP to model their
implantation onto the grains. Simulations from SDTrimSP show that maximal
implantation in the core of the grain is possible, contrary to previous
studies. We find that the 15 M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)} model best explains the
measured concentrations of SiC X grains obtained from Murchison meteorite. For
grains which contained $\ge$ 300 ppm of Fe and Ni, we find implantation
fraction to be $\le$ 0.25 for most probable differential zonal velocities in
this phase which implies that condensation is dominant than implantation unless
the grain did not spend much time in the supernova environment. We show that
radioactive corrections and mixing from the innermost zones is vital to
explaining the excess Ni (condensed as well as implanted) obtained in
laboratory measurements. This mixing also explains the relative abundances of
Co and Ni with respect to Fe simultaneously. The model developed can be used to
predict concentrations of all other elements in various presolar grains
condensed in supernova ejecta and matched against measured concentrations in

Whenever the initial and final states are elements of the same Hilbert space,
the problem can be solved via the characterization of the entanglement classes
which are determined via stochastic operations and classical communication
(SLOCC). In general, there are infinitely many SLOCC classes. However, when
considering transformations from higher- to lower-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
an additional hierarchy among the classes can be found. This hierarchy of SLOCC
classes coarse grains SLOCC classes which can be reached from a common resource

any state within this set can be transformed locally to a full measure set of

heterostructures such as FI/NM or FM/NI (I denotes an insulator). In
particular, the observations of the perpendicular AMR effect stimulate further
interest in the Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction (SOI) at interfaces. Thus,
the Rashba model with exchange splitting (EXS) is considered not only to play
as an effective model for the physical understanding but also to reflect actual
bi-layer systems in current spintronics devices. In the present work, we have
first investigated the temperature dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) of Rashba-type ferromagnets considered effects of spin fluctuations
within the disordered local moment (DLM) scheme. The most distinctive feature
that we observed is that intrinsic AHC increases with increasing temperature.
This can be understood from the aspect of spin chirality, which indicates that
the AHC increases with decreasing EXS when the SOI is much smaller than the
EXS. The extrinsic part of the Fermi surface term also increases with
increasing temperature and has a large contribution, comparable to that of the
intrinsic part. Although, such a behaviour has not yet been observed
experimentally, we suggest that the physical picture found in this work might
lurk in an anomalous Hall effects in Rashbe-type ferromagnets.

investigated with upper main-sequence stars observed by the VISTA Survey of the
Magellanic Clouds. The upper main-sequence stars exhibit highly non-uniform
distributions. Young stellar structures inside the complex are identified from
the stellar density map as density enhancements of different significance
levels. We find that these structures are hierarchically organized such that
larger, lower-density structures contain one or several smaller, higher-density
ones. They follow power-law size and mass distributions as well as a lognormal
surface density distribution. All these results support a scenario of
hierarchical star formation regulated by turbulence. The temporal evolution of
young stellar structures is explored by using subsamples of upper main-sequence
stars with different magnitude and age ranges. While the youngest subsample,
with a median age of log($\tau$/yr)~=~7.2, contains most substructure,
progressively older ones are less and less substructured. The oldest subsample,
with a median age of log($\tau$/yr)~=~8.0, is almost indistinguishable from a
uniform distribution on spatial scales of 30--300~pc, suggesting that the young
stellar structures are completely dispersed on a timescale of $\sim$100~Myr.
These results are consistent with the characteristics of the 30~Doradus complex

zero center-of-mass momentum are formed by photo-excited electrons in the
conduction band and the respective unoccupied states in the valence band of the

resonance or bound state is developed on the basis of the expectation values of
the number operators of the free particles in the continuum. This formalism is
specially suitable for effective field theories in which the bare elementary
states are integrated out but that give rise to resonance and bound states when
implemented in nonperturbative calculations. We demonstrate that $X=1$ for
finite-range energy-independent potentials, either regular or singular. A
non-trivial example for an energy-dependent potential is discussed where it is
shown that $X$ is independent of any type of cutoff regulator employed. The
generalization of these techniques to relativistic states is developed. We also
explain how to obtain a meaningful compositeness with respect to the open
channels for resonances, even if it is complex in a first turn, by making use
of suitable phase-factor transformations. Defining elementariness as $X=0$, we
derive a new universal criterion for the elementariness of a bound state. Along
the same lines, a necessary condition for a resonance to be qualified as
elementary is given. The application of the formalism here developed might be
of considerable practical interest.

DimReader is based on analyzing infinitesimal perturbations of the dataset with

to change each point in the original dataset and we measure the effect that
these changes have on the projection. The recovered axes are in direct analogy
with the axis lines (grid lines) of traditional scatterplots. We also present
methods for discovering perturbations on the input data that change the

easily integrated into programs written in modern programming languages. We

We show that magnetism is tuned by indirect excitation of a Raman-active phonon

this process. The Kerr-de Sitter spacetime has two ergospheres -- associated
with the black hole and the cosmological event horizons. We prove by analysing
turning points of the trajectory that the Penrose process in the cosmological
ergoregion is never possible. We next show that in this process both black hole
and cosmological event horizons' areas increase, the later becomes possible
when the particle coming from the black hole ergoregion escapes through the
cosmological event horizon. We identify a new, local mass function instead of
the mass parameter, to prove this generalized area theorem. This mass function
takes care of the local spacetime energy due to the cosmological constant as
well, including that arises due to the frame dragging effect due to spacetime
rotation. While the current observed value of $\Lambda$ is much tiny, its
effect in this process could be considerable in the early universe scenario
endowed with a rather high value of it, where the two horizons could have
comparable sizes. In particular, the various results we obtain here are also

L-CP and R-CP, from purely repulsive ({\it demixed state}) to weakly attractive
({\it mixed state}), on the morphology, domain size, chain conformations and
distribution of chains in the film are investigated. In the demixed state,
collective structure factor $S(q)$ shows a split of the predominant peak
indicating the presence of two dominant length scales. While there is only one
predominant peak in the mixed state, and hence a lamellar structure with single
domain size. We show that the peak position $q*$ of $S(q)$ can be varied with
the L/R interaction strength and thus allow one to control domain size by
tuning L/R interaction strength without altering the chain size. We further
characterize the chain size and illustrate that this domain size variation is a
consequence of the variation in the size of L-CPs. Furthermore, results on the
average instantaneous shape of R/L-CP reveal that their shapes are very
different both in bulk and near the substrate, and R-CP assumes an oblate shape
near the substrate. This shape/size difference leads to the segregation of
R-CPs near the polymer-substrate interface and hence a relatively higher
density of R-CPs at the interface.

have significant impact on the neutron balance in the astrophysical

relatively low temperatures below $T_9 \lesssim 1$.
  Purpose: The uncertainties of the $^{17,18}$O($\alpha$,n)$^{20,21}$Ne
reactions are investigated. Statistical model calculations are performed to
study the applicability of this model for relatively light nuclei in extension
to a recent review for the $20 \le A \le 50$ mass range.
  Method: The available experimental data for the
$^{17,18}$O($\alpha$,n)$^{20,21}$Ne reactions are compared to statistical model
calculations. Additionally, the reverse $^{20}$Ne(n,$\alpha$)$^{17}$O reaction
is investigated, and similar studies for the $^{17}$F mirror nucleus are
provided.
  Results: It is found that on average the available experimental data for
$^{17}$O and $^{18}$O are well described within the statistical model,
resulting in reliable reaction rates above $T_9 \gtrsim 1.5$ from these
calculations. However, significant experimental uncertainties are identified
for the $^{17}$O($\alpha$,n$_0$)$^{20}$Ne(g.s.) channel.
  Conclusions: The statistical model is able to predict astrophysical reaction
rates for temperatures above 1 GK with uncertainties of less than a factor of
two for the nuclei under study. An experimental discrepancy for the
$^{17}$O($\alpha$,n)$^{20}$Ne reaction needs to be resolved.

  Attributes",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Missing values are a common phenomenon in all areas of applied research.
While various imputation methods are available for metrically scaled variables,
methods for categorical data are scarce. An imputation method that has been
shown to work well for high dimensional metrically scaled variables is the
imputation by nearest neighbor methods. In this paper, we extend the weighted
nearest neighbors approach to impute missing values in categorical variables.
The proposed method, called $\mathtt{wNNSel_{cat}}$, explicitly uses the
information on association among attributes. The performance of different
imputation methods is compared in terms of the proportion of falsely imputed
values. Simulation results show that the weighting of attributes yields smaller
imputation errors than existing approaches. A variety of real data sets is used
to support the results obtained by simulations.

the particle properties of the regolith. We performed compression measurements
on samples of different materials, particle size distributions, and shapes to
examine the relationship between particle size and pressure required for
compression. We used a centrifuge and a compression testing machine for the
experiments. The applied pressure for the centrifuge and the compression
testing machine experiments ranged from 10^2 to 5x10^3 Pa and from 10^4 to
5x10^6 Pa, respectively. The initial porosity before compression was generally
higher for samples with smaller particles and narrower particle size
distributions. A sample compressed more easily when it consisted of smaller
particles, probably due to smaller frictional forces between particles. We
estimated the porosity of granular asteroids based on the results of our
experiments. The estimated porosity at the center of a homogeneous asteroid
with a radius of 50 km is 0.43. This porosity is typical of the porosity of

linear propagation model, the spatially varying transformation matrix exactly
constitutes an affinity matrix that models dense, global pairwise relationships
of an image. Specifically, we develop a three-way connection for the linear
propagation model, which (a) formulates a sparse transformation matrix, where
all elements can be the output from a deep CNN, but (b) results in a dense
affinity matrix that effectively models any task-specific pairwise similarity
matrix. Instead of designing the similarity kernels according to image features
of two points, we can directly output all the similarities in a purely
data-driven manner. The spatial propagation network is a generic framework that
can be applied to many affinity-related tasks, including but not limited to
image matting, segmentation and colorization, to name a few. Essentially, the
model can learn semantically-aware affinity values for high-level vision tasks
due to the powerful learning capability of the deep neural network classifier.
We validate the framework on the task of refinement for image segmentation
boundaries. Experiments on the HELEN face parsing and PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic
segmentation tasks show that the spatial propagation network provides a
general, effective and efficient solution for generating high-quality
segmentation results.

millions of physical qubits. Before the full power of such machines will be
available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and
limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful
algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly
promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is
to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that
minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This
variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as
well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the
target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits.
In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of
near-term quantum devices is discussed.

algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained.
Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for
efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple

first step in auditing a network is reconnaissance by mapping it to get a
comprehensive overview over its structure. The growing complexity, however,
makes this task increasingly effortful, even more as mapping (instead of plain
scanning), presently, still involves a lot of manual work. Therefore, the
concept proposed in this paper automates the scanning and mapping of unknown

verify access controls. It further helps to conduct audits by allowing
comparing documented with actual networks and finding unauthorized network
devices, as well as evaluating access control methods by conducting delta
scans. It uses a novel approach of augmenting data from iteratively chained
existing scanning tools with context, using genuine analytics modules to allow
assessing a network's topology instead of just generating a list of scanned

topology map and a special graph for comparative analysis. The goal is to
provide maximum insight with a minimum of a priori knowledge.

within the $v_2=1$ state near 2 mm with the IRAM 30m Telescope towards IK Tau.
Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling, including radiative pumping to the
vibrational state, was carried out to derive the radial distribution of NH$_3$
in these CSEs. Our modelling shows that the NH$_3$ abundance relative to
molecular hydrogen is generally of the order of $10^{-7}$, which is a few times
lower than previous estimates that were made without considering radiative
pumping and is at least 10 times higher than that in the C-rich CSE of IRC
+10216. Incidentally, we also derived a new period of IK Tau from its $V$-band
light curve. NH$_3$ is again detected in very high abundance in O-rich CSEs.
Its emission mainly arises from localised spatial-kinematic structures that are
probably denser than the ambient gas. Circumstellar shocks in the accelerated
wind may contribute to the production of NH$_3$. (Abridged abstract)

with unprecedented images of the initial conditions and early phases of the

filamentary structure in every interstellar cloud. These filaments all exhibit
remarkably similar widths - about a tenth of a parsec - but only the densest
ones contain prestellar cores, the seeds of future stars. The Herschel results
favor a scenario in which interstellar filaments and prestellar cores represent
two key steps in the star formation process: first turbulence stirs up the gas,
giving rise to a universal web-like structure in the interstellar medium, then
gravity takes over and controls the further fragmentation of filaments into
prestellar cores and ultimately protostars. This scenario provides new insight
into the origin of stellar masses and the star formation efficiency in the
dense molecular gas of galaxies. Despite an apparent complexity, global star
formation may be governed by relatively simple universal laws from filament to

previous studies LM parameter updates have been made tractable for highly
parameterized inverse problems with large data sets by applying matrix
factorization methods or iterative linear solvers to approximately solve the
update equations.
  Some studies have shown that basing model updates on the truncated singular
value decomposition (TSVD) of a dimensionless sensitivity matrix achieved using
Lanczos iteration can speed up the inversion of reservoir models. Lanczos
iterations only require the sensitivity matrix times a vector and its transpose
times a vector, which are found efficiently using adjoint and direct
simulations without the expense of forming a large sensitivity matrix.
  Nevertheless, Lanczos iteration has the drawback of being a serial process,
requiring a separate adjoint solve and direct solve every Lanczos iteration.
Randomized methods, developed for low-rank matrix approximation of large
matrices, are more efficient alternatives to the standard Lanczos method. Here
we develop LM variants which use randomized methods to find a TSVD of a
dimensionless sensitivity matrix when updating parameters. The randomized
approach offers improved efficiency by enabling simultaneous solution of all
adjoint and direct problems for a parameter update.

identifications (95%) and investigate the intrinsic, average spectra of the
sources, divided into broad-line (BL) and narrow-line (NL) AGN, and also in
different bins of X-ray column density and luminosity. The average power-law
photon index for the whole sample is $\Gamma=1.65_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$, flatter
than $\Gamma\approx1.8$ typically found for AGN. While the spectral slope of BL
and X-ray unabsorbed AGN is consistent with typical values
($\Gamma=1.79_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$), a significant flattening is seen in NL AGN and
heavily-absorbed sources ($\Gamma=1.60_{-0.05}^{+0.08}$ and
$\Gamma=1.38_{-0.12}^{+0.12}$, respectively), likely due to the effect of
absorption and to the contribution from Compton reflection to the high-energy
flux (E>10 keV). We find that the typical reflection fraction in our spectra is
$R\approx0.5$ (for $\Gamma=1.8$), with a tentative indication of an increase of
the reflection strength with column density. While there is no significant
evidence for a dependence of the photon index with X-ray luminosity in our
sample, we find that $R$ decreases with luminosity, with relatively high levels
of reflection ($R\approx1.2$) for $L_{\rm 10-40 keV}<10^{44}$ erg/s and
$R\approx0.3$ for $L_{\rm 10-40 keV}>10^{44}$ erg/s AGN, assuming $\Gamma=1.8$.

$\mathbb{C}\times\mathcal{M}_\zeta$ as transverse space. We illustrate and
discuss many aspects of this of constructions emphasizing that the equation
$\pmb{p}\wedge\pmb{p}=0$ which provides the K\""ahler analogue of the
holomorphic sector in the hyperK\""ahler moment map equations canonically
defines the structure of a universal superpotential in the CS theory. The
kernel of the above equation can be described as the orbit with respect to a
quiver Lie group $\mathcal{G}_\Gamma$ of a locus $L_\Gamma \subset
\mathrm{Hom}_\Gamma(\mathcal{Q}\otimes R,R)$ that has also a universal
definition. We discuss the relation between the coset manifold
$\mathcal{G}_\Gamma/\mathcal{F}_\Gamma$, the gauge group $\mathcal{F}_\Gamma$
being the maximal compact subgroup of the quiver group, the moment map
equations and the first Chern classes of the tautological vector bundles that
are in a one-to-one correspondence with the nontrivial irreps of $\Gamma$.
These first Chern classes provide a basis for the cohomology group
$H^2(\mathcal{M}_\zeta)$. We discuss the relation with conjugacy classes of
$\Gamma$ and provide the explicit construction of several examples emphasizing
the role of a generalized McKay correspondence. The case of the ALE manifold
resolution of $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$ singularities is utilized as a comparison
term and new formulae related with the complex presentation of Gibbons-Hawking
metrics are exhibited.

computation from the traditional element-wise assembly to a row-wise concept,
showing that the latter one offers integration that may be orders of magnitude
faster. Considering a B-spline basis function as a non-negative measure, each
mass matrix row is integrated by its own quadrature rule with respect to that
measure. Each rule is easy to compute as it leads to a linear system of
equations, however, the quadrature rules are of the Newton-Cotes type, that is,
they require a number of quadrature points that is equal to the dimension of
the spline space. In this work, we propose weighted quadrature rules of
Gaussian type which require the minimum number of quadrature points while
guaranteeing exactness of integration with respect to the weight function. The
weighted Gaussian rules arise as solutions of non-linear systems of equations.
We derive rules for the mass and stiffness matrices for uniform $C^1$ quadratic
and $C^2$ cubic isogeometric discretizations. Our rules further reduce the
number of quadrature points by a factor of $(\frac{p+1}{2p+1})^d$ when compared
to Calabro et al. (2017), $p$ being the polynomial degree and $d$ the dimension
of the problem, and consequently reduce the computational cost of the mass and
stiffness matrix assembly by a similar factor.

evolution, being a way through which the AGN can affect most of the host
galaxy. However, outflows evolve on timescales much longer than typical AGN
episode durations, therefore most AGN outflows are not observed simultaneously
with the AGN episode that inflated them. It is therefore remarkable that rather
tight correlations between outflow prop- erties and AGN luminosity exist. In
this paper, I show that such correlations can be preserved during the fading
phase of the AGN episode, provided that the AGN lumi- nosity evolves as a power
law with exponent $\alpha_{\rm d} \sim 1$ at late times. I also show that
subsequent AGN episodes that illuminate an ongoing outflow are unlikely to
produce outflow momentum or energy rates rising above the observed
correlations. However, there may be many difficult-to-detect outflows with
momentum and energy rates lower than expected from the current AGN luminosity.
Detailed observations of AGN out- flow properties might help constrain the
activity histories of typical and/or individual AGN.

Cardio/cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) are ineffectual as they do not consider
different stages of platelet activation or the molecular dynamics involved in
platelet interactions. Further they are also incapable to consider
inter-individual variability. A physical description of platelets deposition
was introduced recently in Chopard et. al. [2017], by integrating fundamental
understandings of how platelets interact in a numerical model, parameterized by
five parameters. These parameters specify the deposition process and are
relevant for a biomedical understanding of the phenomena. One of the main
intuition is that these parameters are precisely the information needed for a
pathological test identifying CVD captured and that they capture the
inter-individual variability. Following this intuition, here we devise a
Bayesian inferential scheme for estimation of these parameters. As the
likelihood function of the numerical model is intractable due to the complex
stochastic nature of the model, we use a likelihood-free inference scheme
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to calibrate the parameters in a
data-driven manner. As ABC requires the generation of many pseudo-data by
expensive simulation runs, we use a high performance computing (HPC) framework
for ABC to make the inference possible for this model. We illustrate that our
mean posterior prediction of platelet deposition pattern matches the
experimental dataset closely with a tight posterior prediction error margin for
a collective dataset of 7 volunteers. The present approach can be used to build
a new generation of personalized platelet functionality tests for CVD
detection, using numerical modeling of platelet deposition, Bayesian
uncertainty quantification and High performance computing.

showing the effects of injection locking, our work takes it one step further by
demonstrating the bistable phase in sub-harmonically injection-locked
metronomes --- a key mechanism for oscillator-based Boolean computation.
Although we do not expect to make computers with metronomes, our study

its practical implementations in various fields, eg, MEMS, silicon photonics,

integration scheme to solve r-self-similar, stationary, axisymmetric
magnetohydrodynamics equations describing collimated, relativistic outflows
crossing smoothly all the singular points (Alfven point and modified slow/fast

We present, for the first time with a semi-analytical MHD model, solutions
showing counter-rotation of the jet for a substantial fraction of its extent.
We find diverse jet configurations with bulk Lorentz factors up to 10 and
potential sites for recollimation between $10^3-10^7$ gravitational radii. Such
extended coverage of the intervals of quantities, such as magnetic-to-thermal
energy ratios at the base or the heights/widths of the recollimation region,
makes our solutions suitable for application to many different systems where

The bulk flow and dispersion of discrete electron packets is represented by

a factor of a few discrepancy between the spectral age measured using impulsive
injection models (e.g. JP model) and the dynamical age. The observable
properties of radio sources are predicted to be strongly frequency dependent:
FR-II lobes are expected to appear more elongated at higher frequencies, while
jetted FR-I sources appear less extended. The emerging FR0 class of radio
sources, comprising gigahertz peaked and compact steep spectrum sources, can
potentially be explained by a population of low-powered FR-Is. The extended

materials made of three different fluid phases that we name oil-laden foam
(OLF). In this review, we focus on such systems, with a special emphasis on dry
OLF, i.e. with a total liquid volume fraction, $\varepsilon$ smaller than 5%.
We first try to clarify the physical and chemical conditions for these systems
to appear, we review the different techniques of the literature to obtain them.
Then we discuss their structure and identify two different OLF morphologies,
named foamed emulsion, in which small oil globules are comprised within the
network of the aqueous foam and biliquid foams, where the oil also comprised in
the aqueous foam network is continuous at the scale of several bubbles. Last,
we review the state of the art of their evolution in particular concerning
topological changes, coalescence, coarsening and drainage.

nonlocal quark bilinear operators containing a straight Wilson line along a
spatial direction. We confirm the previous study that mixing among the lowest
dimensional operators, which have mass dimension equals three, can occur if
chiral symmetry is broken in the lattice action. For higher dimensional
operators, we find that the dimension three operators will always mix with
dimension four operators even if chiral symmetry is preserved. Also, the number
of dimension four operators involved in the mixing is large hence it is
impractical to remove the mixing by the improvement procedure. Our result is
important to determining the Bjorken-$x$ dependence parton distribution
functions using the quasi-distribution method on a Euclidean lattice. The
requirement of using large hadron momentum in this approach makes the control
of errors from dimension four operators even more important.

influence of the clause-embedding verb on the factuality of the event described
by the embedded clause. The resource developed provides evidence for the
following three hypotheses: (i) French implicative verbs have an aspect
dependent profile (their inferential profile varies with outer aspect), while
factive verbs have an aspect independent profile (they keep the same
inferential profile with both imperfective and perfective aspect); (ii)
implicativity decreases with imperfective aspect: the inferences triggered by
French implicative verbs combined with perfective aspect are often weakened
when the same verbs are combined with imperfective aspect; (iii) implicativity
decreases with an animate (deep) subject: the inferences triggered by a verb
which is implicative with an inanimate subject are weakened when the same verb
is used with an animate subject. The resource additionally shows that verbs
with different inferential profiles display clearly distinct sub-categorisation
patterns. In particular, verbs that have both factive and implicative readings
are shown to prefer infinitival clauses in their implicative reading, and
tensed clauses in their factive reading.

a daunting task. Critical to the experiment is the manner in which the sky

ongoing experiment that aims to detect the global 21 cm signal. Here we present
the design philosophy of the SARAS 2 system and discuss its performance and

the antenna replaced with a variety of terminations, including a network model

internal additives leave no residuals with Fourier amplitudes exceeding 2~mK,
or residual Gaussians of 25 MHz width with amplitudes exceeding 2~mK. Thus,
even accounting for reflection and radiation efficiency losses in the antenna,
the SARAS~2 system is capable of detection of complex 21-cm profiles at the

the description of thermodynamic properties of hard sphere (HS) fluids in
disordered porous media. Using this approach a porous medium is modelled as a
quenched matrix of hard spheres (HS) or overlapping hard spheres (OHS). A hard
sphere fluid immersed in a matrix can move in a void between matrix particles.
A number of approximations were previously proposed within the SPT2 approach.
Among these approximations, the SPT2b1 has been considered as the most
successful and accurate one in a large range of fluid densities and for
different matrix parameters. However, at high densities, it can lack accuracy,
since it does not take into account that the maximum packing fraction of a HS
fluid in a matrix is limited, not by the geometrical porosity of a matrix
$\phi_{0}$ and the probe particle porosity $\phi$, but by another type of
porosity $\phi^{*}$ introduced in our previous studies. The porosity $\phi^{*}$
is related to the maximal adsorption capacity of a matrix and it is lower than
$\phi_{0}$ and larger than $\phi$. This can be crucial for a fluid in matrices
of low porosities and at high fluid density, especially in the region near
close-packing conditions. Therefore, the approximations SPT2b2 and SPT2b3
taking into account this feature were suggested, although they still needed a
correction because of their poor accuracy. In the present study, we improved
the versions of these approximations, named as SPT2b2$^*$ and SPT2b3$^*$. We
compare these different approximations with the results of computer simulations
performed in the Monte Carlo grand-canonical ensemble. We test the SPT2
approach both for the one- and three-dimensional cases. We show that the
SPT2b3$^*$ provides a very good description of the chemical potential of a
confined fluid, which is better than others.

attacks in control systems. In this paper, we consider the analysis and design
of Gaussian physical watermarks in the presence of packet drops at the control

the other hand, we observe that in certain cases, Bernoulli packet drops can
improve detection performance relative to a purely Gaussian watermark. This
motivates the joint design of a Bernoulli-Gaussian watermark which incorporates
both an additive Gaussian input and a Bernoulli drop process. We characterize
the effect of such a watermark on system performance as well as attack
detectability in two separate design scenarios. Here, we consider a correlation
detector for attack recognition. We then propose efficiently solvable
optimization problems to intelligently select parameters of the Gaussian input

on a heated smooth sapphire substrate at pressures ranging from P = 0.13 bar to

imaging to study the wetting dynamics of the contact between the drop and the
substrate. The spreading drop can be in full contact (contact boiling), it can
partially touch (transition boiling) or the drop can be fully levitated
(Leidenfrost boiling). We show that the temperature of the boundary between
contact and transition boiling shows at most a weak dependency on the impact
velocity, but a significant decrease with decreasing ambient gas pressure. A
striking correspondence is found between the temperature of this boundary and
the static Leidenfrost temperature for all pressures. We therefore conclude
that both phenomena share the same mechanism, and are dominated by the dynamics
taken place at the contact line. On the other hand, the boundary between
transition boiling and Leidenfrost boiling, i.e. the dynamic Leidenfrost
temperature, increases for increasing impact velocity for all ambient gas
pressures. Moreover, the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature coincides for
pressures between P = 0.13 and P = 0.54 bar, whereas for atmospheric pressure
the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature is slightly elevated. This indicates that
the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature is at most weakly dependent on the enhanced
evaporation by the lower saturation temperature of the liquid.

around a Schwarzschild black hole where the accretion disc is threaded by
toroidal magnetic fields. We consider synchrotron radiative process as an
effective cooling mechanism active in the flow. With this, we obtain the global
transonic accretion solutions by exploring the variety of boundary conditions
and dissipation parameters, namely accretion rate (${\dot m}$) and viscosity
($\alpha_B$). The fact that depending on the initial parameters, steady state
accretion flows can possess centrifugally supported shock waves. These global
shock solutions exist even when the level of dissipation is relatively high. We
study the properties of shock waves and observe that the dynamics of the
post-shock corona (hereafter, PSC) is regulated by the flow parameters.
Interestingly, we find that shock solution disappears completely when the
dissipation parameters exceed their critical values. We calculate the critical
values of viscosity parameter ($\alpha^{\rm cri}_B$) adopting the canonical
values of adiabatic indices as $\gamma=4/3$ (ultra-relativistic) and $1.5$
(semi-non-relativistic) and find that in the gas pressure dominated domain,
$\alpha^{\rm cri}_B \sim 0.4$ for $\gamma=4/3$ and $\alpha^{\rm cri}_B \sim
0.27$ for $\gamma=1.5$, respectively. We further show that global shock
solutions are relatively more luminous compared to the shock free solutions.
Also, we have calculated the synchrotron spectra for shocked solutions. When
the shock is considered to be dissipative in nature, it would have an important
implication as the available energy at PSC can be utilized to power the
outflowing matter escaped from PSC. Towards this, we calculate the maximum
shock luminosity and discuss the observational implication of our present

the most popular form of car sharing, one-way car sharing, still suffers from
the vehicle unbalance problem. Innovative solutions to this issue rely on
custom vehicles with stackable capabilities: customers or operators can drive a
train of vehicles if necessary, thus efficiently bringing several cars from an
area with few requests to an area with many requests. However, how to model a
car sharing system with stackable vehicles is an open problem in the related

Finally, we present preliminary results about the impact, on car availability,

and investigate the presence of co-orbital planets down to several tens of
Earth masses. We used archival radial velocity data of 46 close-in (P<5 days)
transiting planets (without detected companions) with information from
high-precision radial velocity instruments. We took advantage of the time of
mid-transit and secondary eclipses (when available) to constrain the possible
presence of additional objects co-orbiting the star along with the planet.
This, together with a good phase coverage, breaks the degeneracy between a
trojan planet signature and signals coming from additional planets or
underestimated eccentricity. We identify nine systems for which the archival

$\alpha$-induced reaction data below the Coulomb barrier. Moreover, the
reliability of a previous OMP for $\alpha$-particles on nuclei within the mass
number range 45$\leq$$A$$\leq$209 has been recently proved for emitted $\alpha$

  Purpose: Analysis of most recent $(\alpha,\gamma)$ reaction data for Ge and
Zr isotopes, which provides an additional validation of the above-mentioned
potential, is related to a further account of $\alpha$-particle emission in
neutron-induced reactions on Zr isotopes, at the same time with a suitable
description of all competitive processes.
  Methods: A consistent parameter set, established or validated by independent
analysis of recent various data, particularly $\gamma$-ray strength functions,
have been involved within model calculation of the $(\alpha,\gamma)$ as well as
$(n,\alpha)$ reaction cross sections. The latter are part of the whole analysis
of the neutron activation of Zr isotopes, in order to avoid any error
compensation or latent ambiguity.
  Results: The aforesaid potential provides a consistent description of recent
$\alpha$-induced reaction data with no empirical rescaling factors of the
$\gamma$ and/or nucleon widths. On the other hand, its use leads to
underestimated predictions of the pre-equilibrium emission and statistical
models for the $(n,\alpha)$ reaction cross sections.
  Conclusions: An optical potential with a volume imaginary component seems to
be needed to describe the low-energy $\alpha$-particle evaporation, while only
surface absorption occurs in $\alpha$-induced reactions at similar energies.

creation of a set of phoneme-to-viseme maps where each has a different quantity
of visemes ranging from two to 45. Viseme classes are based upon the mapping of
articulated phonemes, which have been confused during phoneme recognition, into
viseme groups. Using these maps, with the LiLIR dataset, we show the effect of
changing the viseme map size in speaker-dependent machine lip-reading, measured
by word recognition correctness and so demonstrate that word recognition with
phoneme classifiers is not just possible, but often better than word
recognition with viseme classifiers. Furthermore, there are intermediate units
between visemes and phonemes which are better still.

pairwise distances, computing closeness for all nodes is infeasible for large
real-world networks. However, for many applications, it is only necessary to
find the k most central nodes and not all closeness values. Prior work has
shown that computing the top-k nodes with highest closeness can be done much
faster than computing closeness for all nodes in real-world networks. However,
for networks that evolve over time, no dynamic top-k closeness algorithm exists
that improves on static recomputation. In this paper, we present several
techniques that allow us to efficiently compute the k nodes with highest
(harmonic) closeness after an edge insertion or an edge deletion. Our
algorithms use information obtained during earlier computations to omit
unnecessary work. However, they do not require asymptotically more memory than
the static algorithms (i. e., linear in the number of nodes). We propose
separate algorithms for complex networks (which exhibit the small-world
property) and networks with large diameter such as street networks, and we
compare them against static recomputation on a variety of real-world networks.
On many instances, our dynamic algorithms are two orders of magnitude faster
than recomputation; on some large graphs, we even reach average speedups
between $10^3$ and $10^4$.

  Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX 2018)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Closeness is a widely-used centrality measure in social network analysis. For
a node it indicates the reciprocal of the average shortest-path distance to the
other nodes of the network. While the identification of the k nodes with
highest closeness received significant attention, many applications are
actually interested in finding a group of nodes that is central as a whole. For
this problem, only recently a greedy algorithm has been proposed [Chen et al.,
ADC 2016]. The approximation factor of (1 - 1/e) proposed by Chen et al. for
this algorithm does not hold, though, as we show in this version of our paper.
Since their implementation of the greedy algorithm was still too slow for large
networks, Chen et al. also proposed a heuristic without approximation
guarantee.
  In the present paper we develop new techniques to speed up the greedy
algorithm. Compared to the previous implementation, our approach is orders of
magnitude faster and, compared to the heuristic proposed by Chen et al., we
always find a solution with better quality in a comparable running time in our
experiments. Our method Greedy++ allows us to estimate the group with maximum
closeness on networks with up to hundreds of millions of edges in minutes or at
most a few hours. The greedy approach by [Chen et al., ADC 2016] would take
several days already on networks with hundreds of thousands of edges. Our
experiments show that the solution found by Greedy++ is actually very close to
the optimum (...)
  Note: This paper version fixes the issue of relying on the presumed (but
incorrect) submodularity of group closeness. While this has implications on the
theoretical assessment of the greedy algorithm, our algorithm variant and its
implementation remain unaffected. The reason is that Greedy++ relies (among
others) on the supermodularity of farness, which does hold.

from slow convergence of the scattering source in optically thick and diffusive

increase in computational power, whole core transport calculations have become
a reasonable objective. It however requires using large computers and
parallelizing the transport solver. Due to the elliptic nature of the DSA
operator, its parallelization is not straightforward. In this paper, we present
an acceleration operator derived from the DSA, but defined in a piecewise way
such that its parallel implementation is straightforward. We show that, for
optically thick enough media, this Piecewise Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration

companion, some disc fragments migrate onto the central massive protostar with
dynamical properties showing that its final Keplerian orbit is close enough to

channel for the formation of such short-period binaries, and that both
processes -close massive binary formation and accretion bursts- may happen at

conditions on the shell, considering that it is the boundary between two
spherically symmetric spacetimes. Using this method, and considering two
different Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes as a representation for the Schwarzschild
spacetime, the relevant quantities on the shell are computed, such as its
stress-energy tensor and the action for the whole spacetime. From the obtained
action, the Wheeler-deWitt equation is deduced in order to provide the quantum
framework for the system. Solutions for the wavefunction of the system are
found on both the commutative and NC scenarios. It is shown that, on the
commutative version, the wave function has a purely oscillatory behavior in the
interior of the shell. In the NC setting, it is shown that the wavefunction
vanishes at the singularity, as well as, at the event horizon of the black
hole.

compare the Seyfert 2 ENLRs with the very extended one recently discovered in
the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mrk 783. We have found several
evidences of interaction between the ISM of the galaxies and their radio jets,
such as a) the contribution of shocks in ionizing the high velocity gas, b) the
complex kinematics showed by the profile of the emission lines, c) the high
fragmentation of matter, etc. The results suggest that the ENLR of IC 5063 have
a hollow bi-conical shape, with one edge aligned to the galaxy disk, which may
cause some kind of dependence on velocity of the ionization parameter.
Regarding the Mrk 783 properties, it is found that the extension of the optical
emission is almost twice the size of the radio one and it seems due to the AGN
activity, although there is contamination by star formation around 12 arcsec
from the nucleus. Diagnostic diagrams excluded the contribution of star
formation in IC 5063 and NGC 7212, while the shock contribution was used to
explain the spectra emitted by their high velocity gas.

Lattice Quantum Field Theory. This work is a collection of three studies done
during my Ph.D. period. First we present how to use the reweighting technique
to compensate for the breaking of unitarity due to the use of different
boundary conditions in the valence and sea sector. In particular when twisted
boundary conditions are employed, with $\theta$ twisting angle. In large volume
we found that the breaking is negligible, while in rather small volumes an
effect is present. The quark mass appears to change with $\theta$ as a cutoff
effect. In the second part of the dissertation we present an optimization
method for Hybrid Monte Carlo performances. The work is based on the existence
of a shadow Hamiltonian, an exactly conserved quantity along the Molecular
Dynamics trajectory. The optimization method is economic since it only requires
the forces to be measured, which are already used for the evolution from one
configuration to the new one. We found predictions for the cost of the
simulations with an accuracy of 10% and we could estimate the optimal
parameters for the Omelyan integrator with mass-preconditioning and multi
time-scale. In the last part of the work we address the calculation of
electromagnetic corrections to the hadronic contribution to the $(g-2)$ anomaly
of the muon. A long standing discrepancy between theoretical calculations and
experimental results is present. But before invoking New Physics we need to
clear the sight from possible effects within the Standard Model. In this
exploratory study we carefully matched the masses of the charged pions in the
theory with and without QED. We found a visible effect at the percent level
although consistent with zero within two sigmas.

power nonlinearity on a star graph consisting of $N$ edges and a single vertex

may admit a family of solitary waves parameterized by a translational
parameter, which we call the shifted states. The two main examples include (i)
the star graph with even $N$ under the classical Kirchhoff boundary conditions
and (ii) the star graph with one incoming edge and $N-1$ outgoing edges under a
single constraint on coefficients of the generalized Kirchhoff boundary

shifted states and apply them to the two examples. In the case of (i), we prove
that the shifted states with even $N \geq 4$ are saddle points of the action
functional which are spectrally unstable under the NLS flow. In the case of
(ii), we prove that the shifted states with the monotone profiles in the $N-1$
outgoing edges are spectrally stable, whereas the shifted states with
non-monotone profiles in the $N-1$ outgoing edges are spectrally unstable, the
two families intersect at the half-soliton states which are spectrally stable
but nonlinearly unstable. Since the NLS equation on a star graph with shifted
states can be reduced to the homogeneous NLS equation on a line, the spectral
instability of shifted states is due to the perturbations breaking this
reduction. We give a simple argument suggesting that the spectrally stable
shifted states are nonlinear unstable under the NLS flow due to the
perturbations breaking the reduction to the NLS equation on a line.

presently the largest photometric dataset of asteroids. Up to this point, the
release of large asteroid datasets has always been followed by a redefinition
of asteroid taxonomy. In the years that followed the release of the first
SDSSMOC, several classification schemes using its data were proposed, all using
the taxonomic classes from previous taxonomies. However, no successful attempt
has been made to derive a new taxonomic system directly from the SDSS dataset.
Aims. The scope of the work is to propose a different interpretation scheme for
gauging u0g0r0i0z0 asteroid observations based on the continuity of spectral
features. The scheme is integrated into previous taxonomic labeling, but is not
dependent on them. Methods. We analyzed the behavior of asteroid sampling
through principal components analysis to understand the role of uncertainties
in the SDSSMOC. We identified that asteroids in this space follow two separate
linear trends using reflectances in the visible, which is characteristic of
their spectrophotometric features. Results. Introducing taxonomic classes, we
are able to interpret both trends as representative of featured and featureless
spectra. The evolution within the trend is connected mainly to the band depth
for featured asteroids and to the spectral slope for featureless ones. We
defined a different taxonomic system that allowed us to only classify asteroids
by two labels. Conclusions. We have classified 69% of all SDSSMOC sample, which
is a robustness higher than reached by previous SDSS classifications.
Furthermore, as an example, we present the behavior of asteroid (5129) Groom,
whose taxonomic labeling changes according to one of the trends owing to phase
reddening. Now, such behavior can be characterized by the variation of one
single parameter, its position in the trend.

bipolar bubbles, due to the expanding ionization fronts (I-fronts) driven by
the Hii regions that are formed and embedded in filamentary molecular clouds,
has not been well-studied yet. In addition to the anisotropic expansion of
I-fronts into a filament, B-fields are expected to introduce an additional
anisotropic pressure which might favor expansion and propagation of I-fronts to
form a bipolar bubble. We present results based on near-infrared polarimetric
observations towards the central $\sim$8'$\times$8' area of the star-forming
region RCW57A which hosts an Hii region, a filament, and a bipolar bubble.
Polarization measurements of 178 reddened background stars, out of the 919
detected sources in the JHKs-bands, reveal B-fields that thread perpendicular
to the filament long axis. The B-fields exhibit an hour-glass morphology that
closely follows the structure of the bipolar bubble. The mean B-field strength,
estimated using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is 91$\pm$8 {\mu}G. B-field
pressure dominates over turbulent and thermal pressures. Thermal pressure might
act in the same orientation as those of B-fields to accelerate the expansion of
those I-fronts. The observed morphological correspondence among the B-fields,
filament, and bipolar bubble demonstrate that the B-fields are important to the
cloud contraction that formed the filament, gravitational collapse and star
formation in it, and in feedback processes. The latter include the formation
and evolution of mid-infrared bubbles by means of B-field supported propagation
and expansion of I-fronts. These may shed light on preexisting conditions

Py spin diffusion length {\lambda}_Py is found to be much shorter than the film
thicknesses. The product of {\lambda}_Py and the Py spin Hall angle {\alpha}_SH
is determined to be independent of thickness and resistivity:
{\alpha}_SH*{\lambda}_Py= (0.066 +/- 0.009) nm at 5 K and (0.041 +/- 0.010) nm
at 295 K. These values are comparable to those obtained from mesoscopic Pt
films.

Numerical simulations play a crucial role in understanding transient phenomena

transients occurring in superconducting accelerator magnets. The
magnetoquasistatic problem is solved with a modified magnetic vector potential
formulation, where the cable eddy currents are resolved in terms of their
equivalent magnetization. The heat balance equation is then investigated, and
the relevant heat sources are discussed. The model implements a two-port

cooperative simulation scheme with a lumped-parameter network.

spiral galaxies observed with VLT/MUSE using the O3N2 calibrator. The high
spatial resolution of the data allows us to detect 14345 HII regions with the
same image quality as with photometric data, avoiding any dilution effect. We
develop a new methodology to automatically fit the abundance radial profiles,
finding that 55 galaxies of the sample exhibit a single negative gradient. The
remaining 47 galaxies also display, as well as this negative trend, either an
inner drop in the abundances (21), an outer flattening (10) or both (16), which
suggests that these features are a common property of disc galaxies. The
presence and depth of the inner drop depends on the stellar mass of the
galaxies with the most massive systems presenting the deepest abundance drops,
while there is no such dependence for the outer flattening. We find that the
inner drop appears always around $\rm 0.5\,r_e$, while the position of the
outer flattening varies over a wide range of galactocentric distances.
Regarding the main negative gradient, we find a characteristic slope of
$\alpha_{O/H} = -\,0.10\pm0.03\,\rm{dex}/r_e$. This slope is independent of the
presence of bars and the density of the environment. However, when inner drops
or outer flattenings are detected, slightly steeper gradients are observed.
This suggests that radial motions might play an important role in shaping the
abundance profiles. We define a new normalisation scale ($r_{O/H}$) for the
radial profiles based on the characteristic abundance gradient, with which all
the galaxies show a similar position for the inner drop ($\sim0.5\,r_{O/H}$)
and the outer flattening ($\sim1.5\,r_{O/H}$).Finally, we find no significant
dependence of the dispersion around the negative gradient with any galaxy
property, with values compatible with the uncertainties of the derived
abundances.

the spatial multiplexing gains promised by multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
systems. In this paper, we consider a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
based symbol detection algorithm, called M-BLAST, over uncoded quasi-static
MIMO channels. Relying on the successive interference cancellation (SIC)
receiver, M-BLAST algorithm offers a superior error performance over its
predecessor V-BLAST with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of as large as 2 dB
under various settings of recent interest. Performance analysis of the M-BLAST
algorithm is very complicated since the proposed detection order depends on the
decision errors dynamically, which makes an already complex analysis of the
conventional ordered SIC receivers even more difficult. To this end, a rigorous
analytical framework is proposed to analyze the outage behavior of the M-BLAST
algorithm over binary complex alphabets and two transmitting antennas, which
has a potential to be generalized to multiple transmitting antennas and
multidimensional constellation sets. The numerical results show a very good
match between the analytical and simulation data under various SNR values and
modulation alphabets.

  Eavesdroppers",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of private information retrieval (PIR) is to retrieve one message
out of $K$ messages replicated at $N$ databases, without revealing the identity
of the desired message to the databases. We consider the problem of PIR with
colluding servers and eavesdroppers, named T-EPIR. Specifically, any $T$ out of
$N$ databases may collude, i.e. they may communicate their interactions with
the user to guess the identity of the requested message. An eavesdropper is
curious to know the database and can tap in on the incoming and outgoing
transmissions of any $E$ databases. The databases share some common randomness
unknown to the eavesdropper and the user, and use the common randomness to
generate the answers, such that the eavesdropper can learn no information about
the $K$ messages. Define $R^*$ as the optimal ratio of the number of the
desired message information bits to the number of total downloaded bits, and
$\rho^*$ to be the optimal ratio of the information bits of the shared common
randomness to the information bits of the desired file. In our previous work,
we found that when $E \geq T$, the optimal ratio that can be achieved equals
$1-\frac{E}{N}$. In this work, we focus on the case when $E \leq T$. We derive
an outer bound $R^* \leq (1-\frac{T}{N}) \frac{1-\frac{E}{N} \cdot
(\frac{T}{N})^{K-1}}{1-(\frac{T}{N})^K}$. We also obtain a lower bound of
$\rho^* \geq
\frac{\frac{E}{N}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}{(1-\frac{T}{N})(1-\frac{E}{N} \cdot
(\frac{T}{N})^{K-1})}$. For the achievability, we propose a scheme which
achieves the rate (inner bound)
$R=\frac{1-\frac{T}{N}}{1-(\frac{T}{N})^K}-\frac{E}{KN}$. The amount of shared
common randomness used in the achievable scheme is
$\frac{\frac{E}{N}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}{1-\frac{T}{N}-\frac{E}{KN}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}$
times the file size. The gap between the derived inner and outer bounds
vanishes as the number of messages $K$ tends to infinity.

We adopt a multiplicative composite channel model for both the legitimate

transmitter, consisting of Nakagami-$m$ distributed small-scale fading and
shadowing (large-scale fading) modeled by the Gamma distribution. We consider
the realistic case where small-scale fading between the links is independent,
but shadowing is arbitrarily correlated, and present novel analytical
expressions for the probability that the secrecy capacity falls below a target
secrecy rate. The presented numerically evaluated results, verified by
equivalent computer simulations, offer useful insights on the impact of
shadowing correlation and composite fading parameters on the system's secrecy

nature of the elasto-inertial instability in elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT),
(ii) to identify the role of the bi-dimensional instability in
three-dimensional EIT flows and (iii) to establish the role of the small
elastic scales in the mechanism of self-sustained EIT. Direct numerical
simulations of FENE-P fluid flows are performed in two- and three-dimensional
channels. The Reynolds number is set to $\mathrm{Re}_\tau = 85$ which is
sub-critical for 2D flows but beyond transition for 3D ones. The polymer
properties correspond to those of typical dilute polymer solutions and two
moderate Weissenberg numbers, $\mathrm{Wi}_\tau = 40, 100$, are considered. The
simulation results show that sustained turbulence can be observed in 2D
sub-critical flows, confirming the existence of a bi-dimensional
elasto-inertial instability. The same type of instability is also observed in
3D simulations where both Newtonian and elasto-inertial turbulent structures
co-exist. Depending on the Wi number, one type of structure can dominate and
drive the flow. For large Wi values, the elasto-inertial instability tends to
prevail over the Newtonian turbulence. This statement is supported by (i) the
absence of the typical Newtonian near-wall vortices and (ii) strong
similarities between two- and three-dimensional flows when considering larger
Wi numbers. The role of the small elastic scales is investigated by introducing
global artificial diffusion in the hyperbolic transport equation for polymers.
The study results show that the introduction of large polymer diffusion in the
system strongly damps a significant part of the elastic scales that are
necessary to feed turbulence, eventually leading to the flow laminarization. A
sufficiently high Schmidt number is necessary to allow self-sustained
turbulence to settle.

spectrum with future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization
measurements. In the scope of the inflationary scenario, such features in the
spectrum can be produced by local non-smooth pieces in an inflaton potential
(smooth and quasi-flat in general) which in turn may originate from fast phase
transitions during inflation in other quantum fields interacting with the
inflaton. They can fit some outliers in the CMB temperature power spectrum
which are unaddressed within the standard inflationary ${\mathrm{\Lambda}}$CDM
model. We consider Wiggly Whipped Inflation (WWI) as a theoretical framework
leading to improvements in the fit to the Planck 2015 temperature and
polarization data in comparison with the standard inflationary models, although
not at a statistically significant level. We show that some type of features in
the potential within the WWI models, leading to oscillations in the primordial
power spectrum that extend to intermediate and small scales can be constrained
with high confidence (at 3$\sigma$ or higher confidence level) by an instrument
as the Cosmic ORigins Explorer (CORE). In order to investigate the possible
confusion between inflationary features and footprints from the reionization
era, we consider an extended reionization history with monotonic increase of
free electrons with decrease in redshift. We discuss the present constraints on
this model of extended reionization and future predictions with CORE. We also
project, to what extent, this extended reionization can create confusion in
identifying inflationary features in the data.

this note, we argue that the distribution over small degrees is more important
for the size of the giant component than the precise distribution over very
large degrees. In particular, the tail behavior of the degree distribution does
not play the same crucial role for the size of the giant as it does for many
other properties of the graph. Upper and lower bounds for the component size
are derived for an arbitrary given distribution over small degrees $d\leq L$
and given expected degree, and numerical implementations show that these bounds
are close already for small values of $L$. On the other hand, examples
illustrate that, for a fixed degree tail, the component size can vary
substantially depending on the distribution over small degrees.

first time with ALMA. The peak abundance and distribution of methanol observed
in TW Hya differed from that predicted by chemical models. Here, the chemistry
of methanol gas and ice is calculated using a physical model tailored for TW
Hya with the aim to contrast the results with the recent detection in this
source. New pathways for the formation of larger complex molecules (e.g.,
ethylene glycol) are included in an updated chemical model, as well as the
fragmentation of methanol ice upon photodesorption. It is found that including
fragmentation upon photodesorption improves the agreement between the peak
abundance reached in the chemical models with that observed in TW Hya ($\sim
10^{-11}$ with respect to \ce{H2}); however, the model predicts that the peak
in emission resides a factor of $2-3$ farther out in the disk than the ALMA
images. Reasons for the persistent differences in the gas-phase methanol
distribution between models and the observations of TW Hya are discussed. These
include the location of the ice reservoir which may coincide with the compact
mm-dust disk ($\lesssim 60$~au) and sources of gas-phase methanol which have
not yet been considered in models. The possibility of detecting larger
molecules with ALMA is also explored. Calculations of the rotational spectra of
complex molecules other than methanol using a parametric model constrained by
the TW Hya observations suggest that the detection of individual emission lines
of complex molecules with ALMA remains challenging. However, the
signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced via stacking of multiple transitions
which have similar upper energy levels.

dynamics evolves according to a deterministic Lotka-Volterra system for an
exponential random time after which it switches to a different deterministic
Lotka-Volterra system. This switching procedure is then repeated. The resulting
process is a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). In the case when
the equilibrium points of the two deterministic Lotka--Volterra systems
coincide we show that almost surely the trajectory does not converge to the
common deterministic equilibrium. Instead, with probability one, the densities
of the prey and the predator oscillate between $0$ and $\infty$. This proves a
conjecture of Takeuchi et al (J. Math. Anal. Appl 2006).
  The proof of the conjecture is a corollary of a result we prove about linear
switched systems. Assume $(Y_t, I_t)$ is a PDMP that evolves according to
$\frac{dY_t}{dt}=A_{I_t} Y_t$ where $A_0,A_1$ are $2\times2$ matrices and $I_t$

dynamics in the absence of harvesting is described by a one dimensional
diffusion. Using ergodic optimal control, we find the optimal harvesting
strategy which maximizes the asymptotic yield of harvested individuals. To our
knowledge, ergodic optimal control has not been used before to study harvesting
strategies. However, it is a natural framework because the optimal harvesting
strategy will never be such that the population is harvested to extinction --
instead the harvested population converges to a unique invariant probability
measure.
  When the yield function is the identity, we show that the optimal strategy
has a bang-bang property: there exists a threshold $x^*>0$ such that whenever
the population is under the threshold the harvesting rate must be zero, whereas
when the population is above the threshold the harvesting rate must be at the
upper limit. We provide upper and lower bounds on the maximal asymptotic yield,
and explore via numerical simulations how the harvesting threshold and the
maximal asymptotic yield change with the growth rate, maximal harvesting rate,
or the competition rate.
  We also show that, if the yield function is $C^2$ and strictly concave, then
the optimal harvesting strategy is continuous, whereas when the yield function
is convex the optimal strategy is of bang-bang type. This shows that one cannot
always expect bang-bang type optimal controls.

of a rapidly convergent one-dimensional integral involving a discontinuity of
the imaginary part of its moment generating function across a branch cut. The
latter integral can be evaluated in quadratures, or alternatively represented
as an asymptotic expansion. Our approach thus offers a viable (especially at
high percentile levels) alternative to more standard methods such as Monte
Carlo or the Fast Fourier Transform, traditionally used for such problems. As a
practical application, we use our method to compute the operational Value at
Risk (VAR) of a financial institution, where individual losses are modeled as
spliced distributions whose large loss components are given by power-law or

fields of mp3 bit stream are used. The changes are detected by measuring the
mutual information from those joint distributions. Furthermore, we show that
different mp3 encoders have dissimilar performances. Consequently, a novel
multi-layer architecture for steganalysis of Ump3c is proposed. In this manner,
the first layer detects the encoder and the second layer performs the
steganalysis job. One of advantages of this architecture is that feature
extraction and feature selection can be optimized for each encoder separately.
We show this multi-layer architecture outperforms the conventional single-layer
methods. Comparing results of the proposed method with other works shows an
improvement of 20.4% in the accuracy of steganalysis.

way to compute ground states of nonlinear Schr\""odinger and Gross-Pitaevskii

renormalization (OSR) method to compute ground and excited states (and their
respective eigenvalues) of linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems. The
implementation of the algorithm follows four simple steps: (i) reformulate the
underlying eigenvalue problem as a fixed point equation, (ii) introduce a
renormalization factor that controls the convergence properties of the
iteration, (iii) perform a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process in order to
prevent the iteration from converging to an unwanted mode; and (iv) compute the
solution sought using a fixed-point iteration. The advantages of the OSR scheme
over other known methods (such as Newton's and self-consistency) are: (i) it
allows the flexibility to choose large varieties of initial guesses without
diverging, (ii) easy to implement especially at higher dimensions and (iii) it
can easily handle problems with complex and random potentials. The OSR method
is implemented on benchmark Hermitian linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems
as well as linear and nonlinear non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric models.

target Auger recombination and typically require structural and/or

these modifications are often accompanied by a corresponding degradation in
material quality that decreases the expected gains in high-current external
quantum efficiency. We study origins of these efficiency losses by correlating
chip-level quantum efficiency measurements with structural and optical
properties obtained using a combination of electron microscopy tools. The drop
in quantum efficiency is not found to be correlated with quantum well (QW)
width fluctuations. Rather, we show direct correlation between active region

cathodoluminescence (CL) with characteristic rise time constants on the order
of tens of seconds. We propose a model in which the electron beam fills deep
level defect states and simultaneously drives reduction of the built-in field

accumulation of carrier populations within the QWs. The CL measurements yield
fundamental insights into carrier transport phenomena, efficiency-reducing

challenging job due to the unique properties of network. In this paper, a novel

discovery of services and corresponding routes. Secondly, it provides a
multi-level ontology-based approach to describe the services. This resolves the
issue of semantic interoperability among the service consumers in a scalable
fashion. Finally, to further optimize the performance of the discovery process,
HANDY recommends exploiting the inherent associations present among the
services. These associations are used in two ways. First, periodic service
advertisements are performed based on these associations. In addition, when a
response of a service discovery request is generated, correlated services are
also attached with the response. The proposed service discovery scheme has been
implemented in JIST/SWANS simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed

networks consisting of nodes connected by springs can lead to materials that
exhibit a host of unusual mechanical properties. In particular, global
properties such as the Poisson's ratio or local responses related to
deformation can be precisely altered. Tunable mechanical responses would be
useful in areas ranging from impact mitigation to robotics and, more generally,
for creation of metamaterials with engineered properties. However, experimental
attempts to create auxetic materials based on pruning-based theoretical ideas
have not been successful. Here we introduce a new and more realistic model of
the networks, which incorporates angle-bending forces and the appropriate
experimental boundary conditions. A sequential pruning strategy of select bonds
in this model is then devised and implemented that enables engineering of
specific mechanical behaviors upon deformation, both in the linear and
non-linear regimes. In particular, it is shown that the Poisson's ratio can be
tuned to arbitrary values. The model and concepts discussed here are validated
by preparing physical realizations of the networks designed in this manner,
which are produced by laser cutting two-dimensional sheets and are found to
behave as predicted. Furthermore, by relying on optimization algorithms, we
exploit the networks' susceptibility to tuning to design networks that posses a
distribution of stiffer and more compliant bonds, and whose auxetic behavior is
even greater than that of homogeneous networks. Taken together, the findings
reported here serve to establish that pruned networks represent a promising
platform for the creation of novel mechanical metamaterials.

24 topologically distinct orbits, 22 of which are new, in a small section of
the allowed phase space, with a tendency to overcrowd, due to overlapping
initial conditions. The topologies of these 24 orbits belong to three algebraic
sequences defined as functions of integer $n=0,1,2, \ldots$. Each sequence
extends to $n \to \infty$, but the separation of initial conditions for orbits
with $n \geq 10$ becomes practically impossible with a numerical precision of
16 decimal places. Nevertheless, even with a precision of 16 decimals, it is
clear that in each sequence both the orbit's initial angle $\phi_n$ and its
period $T_n$ approach finite values in the asymptotic limit ($n \to \infty$).
Two of three sequences are overlapping in the sense that their initial angles
$\phi$ occupy the same segment on the circle and their asymptotic values
$\phi_{\infty}$ are (very) close to each other. The actions of these orbits
rise linearly with the index $n$ that describes the orbit's topology, which is
in agreement with the Newtonian case. We show that this behaviour is consistent
with the assumption of analyticity of the action as a function of period.

11, 1811. He entered the Ecole Polytechnique in 1831, from which he was to
emerge 8th two years later. After first devoting himself to chemistry, in 1836
he obtained a position as an astronomy assistant at the Ecole Polytechnique.
This choice will decide his future career which culminates with the discovery
of Neptune in 1846. Le Verrier wrote more than 200 contributions in the Comptes
Rendus de l'Acad\'emie des Sciences. These contributions are very varied: some
original articles but also reports on publications published elsewhere,
sometimes even simple notes of a single page. The whole set gives a very vivid
vision of the development of the science of the XIXth century. At that time,
the Comptes Rendus are really a reflection of the debates of the sessions of
the Academy. They are published very quickly, and leave a large freedom of
speech to the authors. They are therefore a snapshot of the sometimes lively
polemics which animated the sessions of the Academy of Sciences. In this
limited essay, we will look to the first years of the career of Le Verrier
until the discovery of Neptune. (in french) Le Verrier a \'ecrit plus de 200
contributions dans les Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\'emie des Sciences . Ces
contributions sont le reflet des d\'ebats des s\'eances de l'Acad\'emie. Ils

years. It is defined as the process of digitizing a document image into its
constituent characters. Despite decades of intense research, developing OCR
with capabilities comparable to that of human still remains an open challenge.
Due to this challenging nature, researchers from industry and academic circles
have directed their attentions towards Optical Character Recognition. Over the
last few years, the number of academic laboratories and companies involved in
research on Character Recognition has increased dramatically. This research
aims at summarizing the research so far done in the field of OCR. It provides
an overview of different aspects of OCR and discusses corresponding proposals
aimed at resolving issues of OCR.

proliferation of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Easy access to such infrastructure
would remove various obstacles regarding limited EV mobility range. A Battery
Swapping Station (BSS) is an effective approach in supplying power to the EVs,
while mitigating long waiting times in a Battery Charging Station (BCS). In
contrast with the BCS, the BSS charges the batteries in advance and prepares
them to be swapped in a considerably short time. Considering that these
stations can serve as an intermediate entity between the EV owners and the
power system, they can potentially provide unique benefits to the power system.
This paper investigates the advantages of building the BSS from various
perspectives. Accordingly, a model for the scheduling of battery charging from
the station owner perspective is proposed. An illustrative example is provided
to show how the proposed model would help BSS owners in managing their assets
through scheduling battery charging time.

misrepresentation in infrastructure projects and programmes. In 2012 the Hong
Kong government's Development Bureau commissioned a feasibility study on
reference class forecasting in Hong Kong - a first for the Asia-Pacific region.
This study involved 25 roadwork projects, for which forecast costs and
durations were compared with actual outcomes. The analysis established and
verified the statistical distribution of the forecast accuracy at various
stages of project development, and benchmarked the projects against a sample of
863 similar projects. The study contributed to the understanding of how to
improve forecasts by de-biasing early estimates, explicitly considering the
risk appetite of decision makers, and safeguarding public funding allocation by
balancing exceedance and under-use of project budgets.

(self-proclaimed) experts provide probabilistic forecasts on the outcome in the
next stage. A comparison test is a protocol for the policy maker to
(eventually) decide which of the two experts is better informed. The protocol
takes as input the sequence of pairs of forecasts and actual realizations and
(weakly) ranks the two experts. We propose two natural properties that such a
comparison test must adhere to and show that these essentially uniquely
determine the comparison test. This test is a function of the derivative of the
induced pair of measures at the realization.

having one direction of invariance. Various geometries and materials can be
handled or easily added. The two classical scalar polarization cases, denoted
here E// and H//, are addressed as well as the conical vector case. The output
consists in a full energy balance of the problem computed from the field maps.
The 3D vector model grating3D.pro applies to crossed-gratings. These models are

phenomena observed in nuclear fuel containing (NFC) materials. Numerous
$\alpha$-decays lead to local structure transformations in NFC materials. The
damages appearing due to the impacts of heavy nuclear recoils in the subsurface
layer can cause detachments of material particles. Such a behaviour is similar
to sputtering processes observed during a bombardment of the material surface
by a flux of energetic particles. However, in the NFC material, the impacts are
initiated from the bulk. In this work we propose a two-dimensional mesoscopic
model to perform a stochastic simulation of the destruction processes occurring
in a subsurface region of NFC material. We describe the erosion of the material
surface, the evolution of its roughness and predict the detachment of the
material particles. Size distributions of the emitted particles are obtained in
this study. The simulation results of the model are in a qualitative agreement
with the size histogram of particles produced from the material containing
lava-like fuel formed during the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.
