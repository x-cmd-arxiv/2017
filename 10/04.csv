(DFT), a T-Duality invariant reformulation of supergravity (SUGRA). We begin by
reviewing the basic concepts and notions of DFT. Afterwards, we turn to Double
Field Theory on group manifolds (DFT$_{\mathrm{WZW}}$). In order to obtain its
action and gauge transformations, Closed String Field Theory (CSFT)
computations are performed on a worldsheet, governed by a Wess-Zumino-Witten
model on a group manifold. We consider generalized diffeomorphisms and their
gauge algebra, which closes under a modified strong constraint. To explore the
connection between this theory and DFT, we recast it in terms of doubled
generalized objects and extrapolate it to all orders in fields. This yields a
generalized metric formulation and a flux formulation. We study the underlying
symmetries and field equations for both formulations. A novel feature in
DFT$_{\mathrm{WZW}}$ is an additional $2D$-diffeomorphism invariance. An
additional extended strong constraint which breaks the $2D$-diffeomorphism
invariance can be imposed to reduce DFT$_{\mathrm{WZW}}$ to DFT. Furthermore,
we perform a generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactification to recover the bosonic
subsector of half-maximal, electrically gauged supergravities. In this context,
we show how to construct twists for each embedding tensor solution explicitly
by using Maurer-Cartan forms. Finally, we generalize the ideas and notions from
DFT$_\mathrm{WZW}$ to geometric Exceptional Field Theory (gEFT). This allows us
to present a systematic construction for generalized parallelizable spaces in
dim M = 4 SL(5) Exceptional Field Theory (EFT). These spaces permit a unified
treatment of consistent maximally supersymmetric truncations of ten- and
eleven-dimensional supergravity in Generalized Geometry (GG) and their
systematic construction has always been an open question.

Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument onboard the Mars Science
Laboratory (MSL) Rover has made the first measurements of the UV environment on
the surface of Mars, at Gale Crater. Once these measurements are included in a
UV radiative transfer model, we find that modelled UV sol-integrated energies
across the planet are lower than pre-measurement estimates by 35% on average,
considering all latitudes and seasons. This reduction, in turn, reduces the
predicted production of methane from individual accreting IDPs, extending their
lifetimes and increasing the surface concentration of organics that must
accumulate in order to emit sufficient methane to balance the accretion of
organic compounds to Mars. Emission from reasonable accumulations of IDPs could
range up to ~7.9x10^-4 ppbv sol^-1. Richer deposits of organic carbon at the
surface may emit methane at no more than 3.9 ppbv sol^-1. An examination of
IDP-derived methane production during atmospheric settling indicates that no
more than 0.32% of organic carbon from meteor streams may be deposited in the

methane nor the low equilibrium values observed by MSL. Instead, this

in the inner region of a protoplanetary disk $(r \lesssim 1 {\rm au})$. This in
turn affects planet formation. Recently, the effect of disk wind torque has
been considered with the suggestion that it would carve out the surface density
of the disk from inside and would induce global gas flows (wind-driven
accretion). We aim to investigate effects of global gas flows on type I
migration and also examine planet formation. A simplified approach was taken to
address this issue, and N-body simulations with isolation-mass planets were
also performed. In previous studies, the effect of gas flow induced by
turbulence-driven accretion has been taken into account for its desaturation
effect of the corotation torque. If more rapid gas flows (e.g., wind-driven
accretion) are considered, the desaturation effect can be modified. In
MRI-inactive disks, in which the wind-driven accretion dominates the disk
evolution, the gas flow at the midplane plays an important role. If this flow
is fast, the corotation torque is efficiently desaturated. Then, the fact that
the surface density slope can be positive in the inner region due to the wind
torque can generate an outward migration region extended to super-Earth mass
planets. In this case, we observe that no planets fall onto the central star in
N-body simulations with migration forces imposed to reproduce such migration
pattern. We also see that super-Earth mass planets can undergo outward
migration. Relatively rapid gas flows affects type I migration and thus the
formation of close-in planets.

this work, we present six additional $z \gtrsim 6.5$ quasars discovered using
the Pan-STARRS1 survey. We use a sample of 15 $z \gtrsim 6.5$ quasars to
perform a homogeneous and comprehensive analysis of this highest-redshift

$z\gtrsim$6.5 quasars show large blueshifts of the broad CIV
1549\AA$\,$emission line compared to the systemic redshift of the quasars, with
a median value $\sim$3$\times$ higher than a quasar sample at $z\sim$1; (2) we
estimate the quasars' black hole masses (M$\rm_{BH}\sim$0.3$-$5 $\times$
10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$) via modeling of the MgII 2798\AA$\,$emission line and
rest-frame UV continuum; we find that quasars at high redshift accrete their
material (with $\langle (L_{\mathrm{bol}}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}) \rangle = 0.39$) at
a rate comparable to a luminosity-matched sample at lower$-$redshift, albeit
with significant scatter ($0.4$ dex); (3) we recover no evolution of the
FeII/MgII abundance ratio with cosmic time; (4) we derive near zone sizes;
together with measurements for $z\sim6$ quasars from recent work, we confirm a
shallow evolution of the decreasing quasar near zone sizes with redshift.
Finally, we present new millimeter observations of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m
emission line and underlying dust continuum from NOEMA for four quasars, and
provide new accurate redshifts and [CII]/infrared luminosities estimates. The
analysis presented here shows the large range of properties of the most distant

analyze data. Here, we extend the study of turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces
to the supersonic regime and report turbulence statistics conditioned to the
interface. We show that the mathematical artefact of the traditional
Reynolds/Favre decomposition contaminates the Reynolds stresses and thermal
statistics. Our conditional statistics provide direct evidence that turbulent
flow possesses positive Reynolds shear stress everywhere, whereas non-turbulent
flow carries zero Reynolds shear stress. The thermal statistics of turbulent

ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) is a crucial requirement
for the coming era of wireless industrial automation. This paper aims to
develop communication techniques for making such a paradigm shift from the
conventional human-type broadband communications to the emerging machine-type

with high-reliability in the downlink. Motivated by the geographic feature in
industrial automation that in the factories many tasks are assigned to
different groups of devices who work in close proximity to each other and thus
can form clusters of reliable device-to-device (D2D) networks, this paper
proposes a novel two-phase transmission protocol for achieving the above goal.
Specifically, in the first phase within the latency requirement, the
multi-antenna base station (BS) combines the messages of each group together
and multicasts them to the corresponding groups; while in the second phase, the
devices that have decoded the messages successfully, who are defined as the
leaders, help relay the messages to the other devices in their groups. Under
this protocol, we further design an innovative leader selection based
beamforming strategy at the BS by utilizing the sparse optimization technique,
which leads to the desired sparsity pattern in user activity, i.e., at least
one leader exists in each group, in the first phase, thus making full
utilization of the reliable D2D networks in the second phase. Simulation
results are provided to show that the proposed two-phase transmission protocol
considerably improves the reliability of the whole system within the stringent
latency requirement as compared to other existing schemes for URLLC such as
Occupy CoW.

RF-only, in which only small base-stations (SBSs) are available to provide the
coverage to a user, (ii) VLC-only, in which only optical BSs (OBSs) are
available to provide the coverage to a user, (iii) opportunistic RF/VLC, where
a user selects the network with maximum received signal power, and (iv) hybrid
RF/VLC, where a user can simultaneously utilize the available resources from
both RF and VLC networks. The developed model for VLC network precisely
captures the impact of the field-of-view (FOV) of the photo-detector (PD)
receiver on the number of interferers, distribution of the aggregate
interference, association probability, and the coverage of a typical user.
Closed-form approximations are presented for special cases of practical
interest and for asymptotic scenarios such as when the intensity of SBSs
becomes very low. The derived expressions enable us to obtain closed-form
solutions for various network design parameters (such as intensity of OBSs and
SBSs, transmit power, and/or FOV) such that the number of active users can be
distributed optimally among RF and VLC networks. Also, we optimize the network
parameters in order to prioritize the association of users to VLC network.
Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the derived analytical
solutions. Important trade-offs between height and intensity of OBSs are
highlighted to optimize the performance of a user in VLC networks.

  University of East Anglia. July 2016",,,"cs.CV eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine lipreading (MLR) is speech recognition from visual cues and a niche
research problem in speech processing & computer vision. Current challenges
fall into two groups: the content of the video, such as rate of speech or; the
parameters of the video recording e.g, video resolution. We show that HD video
is not needed to successfully lipread with a computer. The term ""viseme"" is
used in machine lipreading to represent a visual cue or gesture which
corresponds to a subgroup of phonemes where the phonemes are visually
indistinguishable. A phoneme is the smallest sound one can utter, because there
are more phonemes per viseme, maps between units show a many-to-one
relationship. Many maps have been presented, we compare these and our results
show Lee's is best. We propose a new method of speaker-dependent
phoneme-to-viseme maps and compare these to Lee's. Our results show the
sensitivity of phoneme clustering and we use our new knowledge to augment a
conventional MLR system. It has been observed in MLR, that classifiers need
training on test subjects to achieve accuracy. Thus machine lipreading is
highly speaker-dependent. Conversely speaker independence is robust
classification of non-training speakers. We investigate the dependence of
phoneme-to-viseme maps between speakers and show there is not a high
variability of visemes, but there is high variability in trajectory between
visemes of individual speakers with the same ground truth. This implies a
dependency upon the number of visemes within each set for each individual. We
show that prior phoneme-to-viseme maps rarely have enough visemes and the
optimal size, which varies by speaker, ranges from 11-35. Finally we decode
from visemes back to phonemes and into words. Our novel approach uses the
optimum range visemes within hierarchical training of phoneme classifiers and
demonstrates a significant increase in classification accuracy.

quench are quantum caustics. Their natural description is in terms of
catastrophe theory and this implies: 1) a hierarchy of light cone structures
corresponding to the different catastrophes; 2) dressing by characteristic wave
functions that obey scaling laws determined by the Arnol'd and Berry indices;
3) a network of vortex-antivortex pairs in space-time inside the cone. We
illustrate the theory by giving explicit calculations for the transverse field
Ising model and the XY model, finding fold catastrophes dressed by Airy
functions and cusp catastrophes dressed by Pearcey functions; multisite
correlation functions are described by higher catastrophes such as the
hyperbolic umbilic. Furthermore, we find that the vortex pairs created inside
the cone are sensitive to phase transitions in these spin models with their
rate of production being determined by the dynamical critical exponent. More
broadly, this work illustrates how catastrophe theory can be applied to
singularities in quantum fields.

techniques that are able to automatically generate code based on some intent
expressed by the programmer. A major challenge for the adoption of synthesis
remains in having the programmer communicate their intent. When the expressed
intent is coarse-grained (for example, restriction on the expected type of an
expression), the synthesizer often produces a long list of results for the
programmer to choose from, shifting the heavy-lifting to the user. An
alternative approach, successfully used in end-user synthesis is programming by
example (PBE), where the user leverages examples to interactively and
iteratively refine the intent. However, using only examples is not expressive
enough for programmers, who can observe the generated program and refine the
intent by directly relating to parts of the generated program.
  We present a novel approach to interacting with a synthesizer using a
granular interaction model. Our approach employs a rich interaction model where
(i) the synthesizer decorates a candidate program with debug information that
assists in understanding the program and identifying good or bad parts, and
(ii) the user is allowed to provide feedback not only on the expected output of
a program, but also on the underlying program itself. That is, when the user
identifies a program as (partially) correct or incorrect, they can also
explicitly indicate the good or bad parts, to allow the synthesizer to accept
or discard parts of the program instead of discarding the program as a whole.
  We show the value of our approach in a controlled user study. Our study shows
that participants have strong preference to using granular feedback instead of
examples, and are able to provide granular feedback much faster.

and chemical evolution of an isolated galaxy. In order to assess the relevance
of different physical parameters and prescriptions, we constructed a suite of
ten simulations, in which we vary the chemical network (primordial and metal
species), how metal cooling is modelled (non-equilibrium versus equilibrium;
optically thin versus thick approximation), the initial gas metallicity (from
ten to hundred per cent solar), and how molecular hydrogen forms on dust. This
is the first work in which metal injection from supernovae, turbulent metal
diffusion, and a metal network with non-equilibrium metal cooling are
self-consistently included in a galaxy simulation. We find that properly
modelling the chemical evolution of several metal species and the corresponding
non-equilibrium metal cooling has important effects on the thermodynamics of
the gas, the chemical abundances, and the appearance of the galaxy: the gas is
typically warmer, has a larger molecular gas mass fraction, and has a smoother
disc. We also conclude that, at relatively high metallicity, the choice of
molecular-hydrogen formation rates on dust is not crucial. Moreover, we confirm
that a higher initial metallicity produces a colder gas and a larger fraction
of molecular gas, with the low-metallicity simulation best matching the
observed molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Finally, our simulations agree
quite well with observations which link star formation rate to metal emission
lines.

also demonstrate that relating local mass accretion rate to shock dissipation

organize information in the jet by resolved phase space and determine the
effective $N$-body phase space at which discrimination power saturates. This
then allows for the construction of a discrimination observable from the
$N$-body phase space coordinates. A general form of this observable can be
expressed with numerous parameters that are chosen so that the observable
maximizes the signal vs.~background likelihood. Here, we illustrate this
technique applied to discrimination of $H\to b\bar b$ decays from massive $g\to
b\bar b$ splittings. We show that for a simple parametrization, we can
construct an observable that has discrimination power comparable to, or better
than, widely-used observables motivated from theory considerations. For the
case of jets on which modified mass-drop tagger grooming is applied, the
observable that the machine learns is essentially the angle of the dominant

scattered light. Combining a thermal emission model with regional variation of

that contribution of the near-IR thermal emission component to the observed DGL

assuming a plane-parallel Galaxy with smooth distributions of the ISRF and dust

scattered light intensity to the 100um intensity corrected for deviation from

the evolution of long-wavelength density perturbations to depend on scale. This
scale-dependent growth leads to the well-known suppression in the linear theory
matter power spectrum that is used to probe neutrino mass. In this paper, we
study the impact of long-wavelength density perturbations on small-scale
structure formation. By performing separate universe simulations where the
long-wavelength mode is absorbed into the local expansion, we measure the
responses of the cold dark matter (CDM) power spectrum and halo mass function,
which correspond to the squeezed-limit bispectrum and halo bias. We find that
the scale-dependent evolution of the long-wavelength modes causes these
quantities to depend on scale and provide simple expressions to model them in
terms of scale and the amount of massive neutrinos. Importantly, this
scale-dependent bias reduces the suppression in the linear halo power spectrum
due to massive neutrinos by 13 and 26% for objects of bias $\bar{b}=2$ and
$\bar{b} \gg1$, respectively. We demonstrate with high statistical significance
that the scale-dependent halo bias ${\it cannot}$ be modeled by the CDM and
neutrino density transfer functions at the time when the halos are identified.

in the very recent past and (2) that galaxies lie on a a single Galaxy Sequence
(GS) rather than a star-forming `main sequence' and a separate region of
`passive' or `red-and-dead' galaxies. The form of the GS is now clearer because
far-infrared surveys such as the Herschel ATLAS pick up a population of
optically-red star-forming galaxies that would have been classified as passive
using most optical criteria. The space-density of this population is at least
as high as the traditional star-forming population. By stacking spectra of
H-ATLAS galaxies over the redshift range 0.001 < z < 0.4, we show that the
galaxies responsible for the rapid low-redshift evolution have high stellar
masses, high star-formation rates but, even several billion years in the past,
old stellar populations - they are thus likely to be relatively recent
ancestors of early-type galaxies in the Universe today. The form of the GS is
inconsistent with rapid quenching models and neither the analytic bathtub model

evolution. We propose a new gentler model of galaxy evolution that can explain
the new Herschel results and other key properties of the galaxy population.

stars by GMCs, bars/spiral arms, or merging subhalos; alternatively the stars
could have simply been born out of a more turbulent ISM at high redshift and
retain that larger velocity dispersion till present day - consistent with
recent IFU studies. To ascertain the dominant mechanism and better understand
the impact of instabilities and feedback, we develop models based on observed
SFHs of these Local Group galaxies in order to create an evolutionary formalism
which describes the ISM velocity dispersion due to a galaxy's evolving gas
fraction. These empirical models relax the common assumption that the stars are
born from gas which has constant velocity dispersion at all redshifts. Using
only the observed SFHs as input, the ISM velocity dispersion and a mid-plane
scattering model fits the observed AVRs of low mass galaxies without fine
tuning. Higher mass galaxies above $M_{vir} > 10^{11}$ need a larger
contribution from latent dynamical heating processes (for example minor
mergers), in excess of the ISM model. Using the SFHs we also find that
supernovae feedback does not appear to be a dominant driver of the gas velocity
dispersion compared to gravitational instabilities - at least for dispersions
$\sigma \gtrsim 25$ km/s. Together our results point to stars being born with a
velocity dispersion close to that of the gas at the time of their formation,
with latent dynamical heating operating with a galaxy mass-dependent
efficiency. These semi-empirical relations may help constrain the efficiency of
feedback and its impact on the physics of disk settling in galaxy formation

present-day Galactocentric distances, $>$15 kpc. The data-set we acquired
consists of high resolution HET/HRS, Magellan/MIKE and VLT/UVES spectra for 28
red giant branch stars covering a wide metallicity range, $-3.1

over Fe as a function of [Fe/H] for our sample of outer halo stars is not
dissimilar from the pattern shown by MW halo stars from solar neighborhood
samples. On the other hand, significant differences appear at [Fe/H]$\gtrsim
-1.5$ when considering chemical abundance ratios such as [Ba/Fe], [Na/Fe],
[Ni/Fe], [Eu/Fe], [Ba/Y]. Qualitatively, this type of chemical abundance trends
are observed in massive dwarf galaxies, such as Sagittarius and the Large
Magellanic Cloud. This appears to suggest a larger contribution in the outer

particles to the disk ionization of young stars. In contrast with a previous
theoretical study finding dominance of energetic particles over X-ray in the
ionization throughout the disk, we find that the disk ionization is likely
dominated by X-rays over much of its area except within narrow regions where
particles are channeled onto the disk by the strongly-tangled and turbulent
magnetic field. The radial thickness of such regions is $\sim 5$ stellar radii
close to the star and broadens with increasing radial distance. This likely

We compare GC system sizes to the sizes and masses of their host galaxies. We
find that GC systems typically extend to 4$\times$ that of the host galaxy
size, however this factor varies with galaxy stellar mass from about 3$\times$
for M$^{\ast}$ galaxies to 5$\times$ for the most massive galaxies in the

radius (R$_{200}$) and with the halo mass (M$_{200}$) to the 1/3 power. The GC
system of the Milky Way follows the same relations as for early-type galaxies.
For Ultra Diffuse Galaxies their GC system size scales with halo mass and
virial radius as for more massive, larger galaxies. UDGs indicate that the

contribution, independent of the temperature or details of the entangling
region. We offer a definition and interpretation of subregion complexity in the
context of tensor networks, and show numerically that it reproduces the
qualitative features of the holographic computation in the case of a random
tensor network using its relation to the Ising model. Finally, we give a
prescription for computing subregion complexity directly in CFT using the
kinematic space formalism, and use it to reproduce some of our explicit gravity
results obtained at zero temperature. We thus obtain a concrete matching of
results for subregion complexity between the gravity and tensor network
approaches, as well as a CFT prescription.

that now depends entirely on user intuition. While slight perturbation is
tolerable for robots with moveable bases, correcting the problem is imperative
for fixed-base robots if some essential task sections are out of reach. For
mobile manipulation robots, it is necessary to decide on a specific base
position before beginning manipulation tasks.
  This paper presents Reuleaux, an open source library for robot reachability
analyses and base placement. It reduces the amount of extra repositioning and
removes the manual work of identifying potential base locations. Based on the
reachability map, base placement locations of a whole robot or only the arm can
be efficiently determined. This can be applied to both statically mounted
robots, where position of the robot and work piece ensure the maximum amount of
work performed, and to mobile robots, where the maximum amount of workable area
can be reached. Solutions are not limited only to vertically constrained
placement, since complicated robotics tasks require the base to be placed at
unique poses based on task demand.
  All Reuleaux library methods were tested on different robots of different
specifications and evaluated for tasks in simulation and real world
environment. Evaluation results indicate that Reuleaux had significantly
improved performance than prior existing methods in terms of time-efficiency
and range of applicability.

grasping and recognizing both known and novel objects in cluttered
environments. The key new feature of the system is that it handles a wide range
of object categories without needing any task-specific training data for novel
objects. To achieve this, it first uses a category-agnostic affordance
prediction algorithm to select and execute among four different grasping
primitive behaviors. It then recognizes picked objects with a cross-domain
image classification framework that matches observed images to product images.
Since product images are readily available for a wide range of objects (e.g.,
from the web), the system works out-of-the-box for novel objects without
requiring any additional training data. Exhaustive experimental results
demonstrate that our multi-affordance grasping achieves high success rates for
a wide variety of objects in clutter, and our recognition algorithm achieves
high accuracy for both known and novel grasped objects. The approach was part

present convincing numerical results to show that our schemes are not only much
more efficient and easy to implement, but can also better capture the physical

quiescent counterpart to be a late-K/early-M dwarf star at a distance of
$5\pm2$ kpc. This implies that the peak $0.5-10$ keV luminosity of the system
is $10^{36.4\pm0.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. As found by Mata Sanchez et al., the
outburst properties of MAXI J1957$+$032 are most consistent with the sample of
accreting millisecond pulsars. However, the low inferred accretion rate, and
the lack of evidence for a hydrogen-rich accretion flow, are difficult to
reconcile with the late-K/early-M dwarf counterpart being the mass donor.
Instead, the observations are best described by a low-mass hydrogen- and
possibly helium-poor mass donor, such as a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, forming a
tight interacting binary with a neutron star. The observed main-sequence
counterpart would then likely be in a wide orbit around the inner binary.

magnetic spots on the surface of neutron stars, and to the displacement of the
magnetic dipole axis. We find that a toroidally dominated magnetic field is
essential for the generation of a single spot with a strong magnetic field.
Once a spot forms, it survives for several million years, even after the total
magnetic field has decayed significantly. We find that the dipole axis is not
stationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general
coincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to
non-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal
dipole axis at rates that may reach $0.4^{\circ}$ per century. A misaligned
poloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant
displacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss
the evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the $P-\dot{P}$
diagram and the observational implications. We find that neutron stars spend a
very short time before they cross the Death-Line of the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram,
compared to their characteristic ages. Moreover, the maximum intensity of their
surface magnetic field is substantially higher than the dipole component of the
field. We argue that SGR 0418+5729 could be an example of this type of
behaviour, having a weak dipole field, yet hosting a magnetic spot responsible
for its magnetar behaviour. The evolution on the pulse profile and braking
index of the Crab pulsar, which are attributed to an increase of its obliquity,
are compatible with the anticipated drift of the magnetic axis.

the form of stellar winds, driven by thermal pressure and complex
magnetohydrodynamic processes. These magnetized outflows probably do not
significantly affect the star's structural evolution on the Main Sequence, but
they brake the stellar rotation by removing angular momentum, a mechanism known
as magnetic braking. Previous studies have shown how the braking torque depends
on magnetic field strength and geometry, stellar mass and radius, mass-loss
rate, and the rotation rate of the star, assuming a fixed coronal temperature.
For this study we explore how different coronal temperatures can influence the
stellar torque. We employ 2.5D, axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulations,
computed with the PLUTO code, to obtain steady-state wind solutions from
rotating stars with dipolar magnetic fields. Our parameter study includes 30
simulations with variations in coronal temperature and surface-magnetic-field
strength. We consider a Parker-like (i.e. thermal-pressure-driven) wind, and
therefore coronal temperature is the key parameter determining the velocity and
acceleration profile of the flow. Since the mass loss rates for these types of
stars are not well constrained, we determine how torque scales for a vast range
of stellar mass loss rates. Hotter winds lead to a faster acceleration, and we
show that (for a given magnetic field strength and mass-loss rate) a hotter
outflow leads to a weaker torque on the star. We derive new predictive torque
formulae for each temperature, which quantifies this effect over a range of

peculiarities of evolution of star formation in these galaxies. The HI mass to
luminosity ratio of giant galaxies appears not to differ from that of normal
size galaxies, giving evidences in favor of similar star formation efficiency.
I also found that the bars and rings occur more frequently among giant discs. I
performed mass-modelling of the subsample of 18 giant galaxies with available
rotation curves and surface photometry data and constructed $\chi^2$ maps for
the parameters of their dark matter haloes. These estimates indicate that giant
discs tend to be formed in larger more massive and rarified dark haloes in
comparison to moderate size galaxies. However giant galaxies do not deviate
significantly from the relations between the optical sizes and dark halo
parameters for moderate size galaxies. These findings can rule out the
catastrophic scenario of the formation of at least most of giant discs, since
they follow the same relations as normal discy galaxies. The giant sizes of the

convergence and adaptation times of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$. This paper shows that if
the utility function is concave and smooth, then $O(\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)$
convergence time is possible via an existing stochastic variation on the
Frank-Wolfe algorithm, called the RUN algorithm. Next, a converse result is
proven to show it is impossible for any algorithm to have convergence time
better than $O(1/\epsilon)$, provided the algorithm has no a-priori knowledge
of channel state probabilities. Hence, RUN is within a logarithmic factor of
convergence time optimality. However, RUN has a vanishing stepsize and hence
has an infinite adaptation time. Using stochastic Frank-Wolfe with a fixed

time increases to $O(1/\epsilon^2)$, similar to existing drift-plus-penalty

arrhythmias) potential in drug candidates. The method is performed using
descriptors comprised of atomic NMR chemical shifts and corresponding
interatomic distances which are combined into a 3D abstract space matrix. The
method is called 3D-SDAR (3 dimensional spectral data-activity relationship)
and can be interrogated to identify molecular features responsible for the
activity, which can in turn yield simplified hERG toxicophores. A dataset of 55

concave surface and hence, it is subject to the centrifugal force. It is well
known that such flows may experience the Centrifugal Instability (CFI), to
which there are many laboratory examples. The recent computer simulations of
relativistic jets from Active Galactic Nuclei undergoing the process of
reconfinement show that in such jets CFI may dominate over the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability associated with velocity shear (Gourgouliatos and Komissarov 2018).
In this letter, we generalise the Rayleigh criterion for CFI in rotating fluids
to relativistic flows using a heuristic analysis. We also present the results
of computer simulations which support our analytic criterion for the case of an
interface separating two uniformly-rotating cylindrical flows. We discuss the
difference between CFI and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in flows with curved
streamlines.

well as its application to current sheet and flux tube models. The 'inverse
problem' is that of determining a Vlasov-Maxwell equilibrium distribution
function self-consistent with a given magnetic field. We develop the theory of
inversion using expansions in Hermite polynomials of the canonical momenta.
Sufficient conditions for the convergence of a Hermite expansion are found,
given a pressure tensor. For large classes of DFs, we prove that non-negativity
of the distribution function is contingent on the magnetisation of the plasma,
and make conjectures for all classes.
  The inverse problem is considered for nonlinear 'force-free Harris sheets'.
By applying the Hermite method, we construct new models that can describe
sub-unity values of the plasma beta $(\beta_{pl})$ for the first time. Whilst
analytical convergence is proven for all $\beta_{pl}$, numerical convergence is
attained for $\beta_{pl}= 0.85$, and then $\beta_{pl} = 0.05$ after a
're-gauging' process.
  We consider the properties that a pressure tensor must satisfy to be
consistent with 'asymmetric Harris sheets', and construct new examples. It is
possible to analytically solve the inverse problem in some cases, others must
be tackled numerically. We present new exact Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria for
asymmetric current sheets, which can be written as a sum of shifted Maxwellian
distributions, ideal for implementations in particle-in-cell simulations.
  We study the correspondence between the microscopic and macroscopic
descriptions of equilibrium in cylindrical geometry, and then attempt to find
Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria for the nonlinear force-free 'Gold-Hoyle' model.
However, it is necessary to include a background field, which can be
arbitrarily weak if desired. The equilibrium can be electrically non-neutral,
depending on the bulk flows.

principle, we propose the novel problem of Attribute-based Relationship
Profiling (ARP), to profile the closeness w.r.t. the underlying relationships

attributes (e.g., education) and, as output, learn a set of social affinity
graphs, where each link is weighted by its probabilities of carrying the
relationships. As requirements, ARP should be systematic and complete to
profile every link for every relationship-- our challenges lie in effectively
modeling homophily. We propose a novel reverse smoothness principle by
observing that the similarity-closeness duality of homophily is consistent with
the well-known smoothness assumption in graph-based semi-supervised learning--
only the direction of inference is reversed. To realize smoothness over noisy
social graphs, we further propose a novel holistic closeness modeling approach

high mobility SL devices by integrating surface dielectric patterning with
atomically thin van der Waals materials. By separating the device assembly and
SL fabrication processes, we address the intractable tradeoff between device
processing and mobility degradation that constrains SL engineering in
conventional systems. The improved electrostatics of atomically thin materials
moreover allows smaller wavelength SL patterns than previously achieved.
Replica Dirac cones in ballistic graphene devices with sub 40nm wavelength SLs
are demonstrated, while under large magnetic fields we report the fractal
Hofstadter spectra from SLs with designed lattice symmetries vastly different

predictor space dimension in regression problems. We consider SDR in the

uncovering ridge structure in functions, and two primary algorithms for
SDR---sliced inverse regression (SIR) and sliced average variance estimation
(SAVE)---approximate matrices of integrals using a sliced mapping of the
response. We interpret this sliced approach as a Riemann sum approximation of
the particular integrals arising in each algorithm. We employ well-known tools
from numerical analysis---namely, multivariate tensor product Gauss-Christoffel
quadrature and orthogonal polynomials---to produce new algorithms that improve
upon the Riemann sum-based numerical integration in SIR and SAVE. We call the
new algorithms Lanczos-Stieltjes inverse regression (LSIR) and
Lanczos-Stieltjes average variance estimation (LSAVE) due to their connection
with Stieltjes' method---and Lanczos' related discretization---for generating a
sequence of polynomials that are orthogonal to a given measure. We show that
the quadrature-based approach approximates the desired integrals, and we study
the behavior of LSIR and LSAVE with three numerical examples. As expected in
high order numerical integration, the quadrature-based LSIR and LSAVE exhibit
exponential convergence in the integral approximations compared to the first
order convergence of the classical SIR and SAVE. The disadvantage of LSIR and
LSAVE is that the underlying tensor product quadrature suffers from the curse
of dimensionality---that is, the number of quadrature nodes grows exponentially
with the input space dimension. Therefore, the proposed approach is most
appropriate for deterministic functions with fewer than ten independent inputs.

a wide spectrum of real-world applications such as in communication systems,
cyber-physical systems security, as well as financial, political, and electoral
competition. As such, developing analytical tools to model and analyze
competitive resource allocation is crucial for devising optimal allocation
strategies and anticipating the potential outcomes of the competition. To this
end, the Colonel Blotto game is one of the most popular game-theoretic
frameworks for modeling and analyzing such competitive resource allocation
problems. However, in many real-world competitive situations, the Colonel
Blotto game does not admit solutions in deterministic strategies and, hence,
one must rely on analytically complex mixed-strategies with their associated
tractability, applicability, and practicality challenges. In this paper, a
generalization of the Colonel Blotto game which enables the derivation of
deterministic, practical, and implementable equilibrium strategies is proposed
while accounting for the heterogeneity of the battlefields. In addition, the
proposed generalized game enables accounting for the consumed resources in each
battlefield, a feature that is not considered in the classical Blotto game. For
the generalized game, the existence of a Nash equilibrium in pure-strategies is
shown. Then, closed-form analytical expressions of the equilibrium strategies,
are derived and the outcome of the game is characterized; based on the number
of resources of each player as well as the valuation of each battlefield. The
generated results provide invaluable insights on the outcome of the
competition. For example, the results show that, when both players are fully
rational, the more resourceful player can achieve a better total payoff at the
Nash equilibrium, a result that is not mimicked in the classical Blotto game.

the exposure of their websites. In other words, cloaking has long served as a
major malicious technique in search engine optimization (SEO). Cloaking hides
the true nature of a website by delivering blatantly different content to users
versus web crawlers. Recently, we have also witnessed a rising trend of
employing cloaking in search engine marketing (SEM). However, detecting
cloaking is challenging. Existing approaches cannot detect IP cloaking and are
not suitable for detecting cloaking in SEM because their search-and-visit
method leads to click fraud. In addition, they focus on detecting and measuring
cloaking on the server side, but the results are not visible to users to help
them avoid frauds.
  Our work focuses on mitigating IP cloaking and SEM cloaking, and providing
client-based real-time cloaking detection services. To achieve these goals, we
first propose the Simhash-based Website Model (SWM), a condensed representation
of websites, which can model natural page dynamics. Based on SWM, we design and
implement Cloaker Catcher, an accurate, efficient and privacy-preserving
system, that consists of a server that crawls websites visited by users on
demand and a client-side extension that fetches spider views of websites from
the server and compares them with user views to detect cloaking. Since Cloaker
Catcher checks on the client side for each real user, IP cloaking can be
detected whenever it occurs and click fraud in SEM can also be prevented. Using
our system, we conducted the first analysis of SEM cloaking and found that the
main purpose of SEM cloakers is to provide illicit services.

  NOMA Systems","Submitted for possible publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the resource allocation algorithm design for
multiple-input single-output (MISO) multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access
(MC-NOMA) systems, in which a full-duplex base station serves multiple
half-duplex uplink and downlink users on the same subcarrier simultaneously.
The resource allocation is optimized for maximization of the weighted system
throughput while the information leakage is constrained and artificial noise is
injected to guarantee secure communication in the presence of multiple
potential eavesdroppers. To this end, we formulate a robust non-convex
optimization problem taking into account the imperfect channel state
information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channels and the quality-of-service
(QoS) requirements of the legitimate users. Despite the non-convexity of the
optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic optimization
which yields the optimal beamforming, artificial noise design, subcarrier
allocation, and power allocation policy. The optimal resource allocation policy
serves as a performance benchmark since the corresponding monotonic
optimization based algorithm entails a high computational complexity. Hence, we
also develop a low-complexity suboptimal resource allocation algorithm which
converges to a locally optimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that the
performance of the suboptimal algorithm closely approaches that of the optimal
algorithm. Besides, the proposed optimal MISO NOMA system can not only ensure
downlink and uplink communication security simultaneously but also provides a
significant system secrecy rate improvement compared to traditional MISO
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) systems and two other baseline schemes.

381+/-55 km/s , offset by 0.13 +/- 0.03 from the SMBH, consistent with previous
high-resolution long-slit observations. There is a lack of near-infrared (NIR)
emission at the position of the SMBH and young nuclear cluster, suggesting a
spatial separation between the young and old stellar populations within the
nucleus. We compare the observed kinematics with dynamical models from Peiris &
Tremaine (2003). The best-fit disk orientation to the NIR flux is [$\theta_l$,
$\theta_i$, $\theta_a$] = [-33 +/- 4$^{\circ}$, 44 +/- 2$^{\circ}$, -15 +/-
15$^{\circ}$], which is tilted with respect to both the larger-scale galactic
disk and the best-fit orientation derived from optical observations. The
precession rate of the old disk is $\Omega_P$ = 0.0 +/- 3.9 km/s/pc, lower than

stellar winds from the disk will collide and shock, driving rapid gas inflows

planetary climate and habitability is critical for us to search for a habitable
world beyond our solar system. The orbital configurations of M-dwarf planets
are always tidally-locked at resonance states, which are quite different from
those around Sun-like stars. M-dwarf planets need to be investigated
separately. Here we use a comprehensive three-dimensional atmospheric general
circulation model to systematically investigate how eccentricity influences
climate and habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets. The simulation results show
that (1) the seasonal climatic cycles of such planets are very weak even for e
= 0.4. It is unlikely that an aqua planet falls out of a habitable zone during
its orbit. (2) The annual global mean surface temperature significantly
increases with increased eccentricity, due to the decrease of the cloud albedo.
Both the runaway greenhouse inner edge and moist greenhouse inner edge shift
outward. (3) Planets in an eccentric orbit can be captured in other spin-orbit
resonance states which lead to different climate patterns, namely eyeball
pattern and striped-ball pattern.The striped-ball pattern has evidently higher
surface temperatures due to the reduced planetary albedo. Near the outer edge,
planets with p = 1.0 and 2.0 are more resistant to the snowball state due to
more locally-concentrated stellar fluxes. Thus, planets with integer spin-orbit
resonance numbers have wider habitable zones than those with half-integer
spin-orbit resonance states. Above all, as a comparison to circular orbit,
eccentricity shrinks the width of the habitable zone.

centers on the equilibria that they focus on: the price of anarchy
characterizes the quality of the worst-performing equilibria, while the price
of stability characterizes the quality of the best-performing equilibria. While
much of the literature focuses on these metrics from an analysis perspective,
in this work we consider these performance metrics from a design perspective.
Specifically, we focus on the setting where a system operator is tasked with
designing local utility functions to optimize these performance metrics in a
class of games termed covering games. Our main result characterizes a
fundamental trade-off between the price of anarchy and price of stability in
the form of a fully explicit Pareto frontier. Within this setup, optimizing the
price of anarchy comes directly at the expense of the price of stability (and
vice versa). Our second results demonstrates how a system-operator could
incorporate an additional piece of system-level information into the design of
the agents' utility functions to breach these limitations and improve the

was designed to observe the decay and measure its branching ratio (BR).
Focusing on this golden decay in quark flavor physics provides an ideal
candidate to probe for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). The established
experimental upper limit of the branching ratio was set by the KEK E391a
collaboration at 2.6 x 10$^{-8}$. This is still well above the standard model
value of the branching ratio, which is predicted to be 2.43 x 10$^{-11}$ with
minor uncertainties. The important signal is a pair of photons from the
$\pi^{0}$ decay and no coincident signals from veto counters. This along with a
large discernible transverse momentum provides us with unique signature. KOTO
uses a Cesium Iodide (CsI) electromagnetic calorimeter as the main photon
detector and hermetic veto counters to ensure that there are no other de-

in a program evaluation context, the difference between the intercepts in
outcome equations for participants and non-participants can be interpreted as
the difference in average outcomes of participants and their counterfactual
average outcomes if they had chosen not to participate. The new estimator can
under mild conditions exhibit a rate of convergence in probability equal to
$n^{-p/(2p+1)}$, where $p\ge 2$ is an integer that indexes the strength of
certain smoothness assumptions. This rate of convergence is shown in this
context to be the optimal rate of convergence for estimation of the intercept
parameter in terms of a minimax criterion. The new estimator, unlike other
proposals in the literature, is under mild conditions consistent and
asymptotically normal with a rate of convergence that is the same regardless of
the degree to which selection depends on unobservables in the outcome equation.

  Orders",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical modeling of fMRI data is challenging as the data are both
spatially and temporally correlated. Spatially, measurements are taken at
thousands of contiguous regions, called voxels, and temporally measurements are
taken at hundreds of time points at each voxel. Recent advances in Bayesian
hierarchical modeling have addressed the challenges of spatiotemproal structure
in fMRI data with models incorporating both spatial and temporal priors for
signal and noise. While there has been extensive research on modeling the fMRI
signal (i.e., the covolution of the experimental design with the functional
choice for the hemodynamic response function) and its spatial variability, less
attention has been paid to realistic modeling of the temporal dependence that
typically exists within the fMRI noise, where a low order autoregressive
process is typically adopted. Furthermore, the AR order is held constant across
voxels (e.g. AR(1) at each voxel). Motivated by an event-related fMRI
experiment, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model with automatic
selection of the autoregressive orders of the noise process that vary spatially
over the brain. With simulation studies we show that our model has improved
accuracy and apply it to our motivating example.

quantifying how nonlinearities affect system properties at finite temperature.
Packings of disks with purely repulsive contact interactions possess two main
types of nonlinearities, one from the form of the interaction potential and one
from the breaking (or forming) of interparticle contacts. To identify the
temperature regime at which the contact-breaking nonlinearities begin to
contribute, we first calculated the minimum temperatures $T_{cb}$ required to
break a single contact in the MS packing for both single and multiple eigenmode
perturbations of the $T=0$ MS packing. We then studied deviations in the
constant volume specific heat $C_V$ and deviations of the average disk
positions $\Delta r$ from their $T=0$ values in the temperature regime $T_{cb}
< T < T_{r}$, where $T_r$ is the temperature beyond which the system samples
the basin of a new MS packing. We find that the deviation in the specific heat
per particle $\Delta {\overline C}_V^0/{\overline C}_V^0$ relative to the zero
temperature value ${\overline C}_V^0$ can grow rapidly above $T_{cb}$, however,
the deviation $\Delta {\overline C}_V^0/{\overline C}_V^0$ decreases as
$N^{-1}$ with increasing system size. To characterize the relative strength of
contact-breaking versus form nonlinearities, we measured the ratio of the
average position deviations $\Delta r^{ss}/\Delta r^{ds}$ for single- and

measurement of black hole spin remains extremely challenging. We here aim at
comparing the mean radiative efficiencies of carefully matched samples of
radio-loud and radio-quiet SDSS quasars at 0.3<z<0.8. We use the [OIII]

pronounced. We find that the radio-loud sample shows an enhancement in [OIII]
line strength by a factor of at least 1.5 compared to a radio-quiet sample
matched in redshift, black hole mass and optical continuum luminosity or
accretion rate. We argue that this enhancement is caused by differences in the
SED, suggesting higher average bolometric luminosities at fixed accretion rate
in the radio-loud population. This suggests that the radio-loud quasar
population has on average systematically larger radiative efficiencies and
therefore higher black hole spin than the radio-quiet population, providing
observational support for the black hole spin paradigm.

artifacts may exist in synthesizing hairpins and glasses, and textural details
may be lost in the regions of hair or mustache. Moreover, the generalization
ability of current systems is somewhat limited since they usually require
elaborately collecting a dictionary of examples or carefully tuning
features/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning
framework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure
and texture decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input
face photo into different components according to their representational
contents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, we utilize a Branched Fully

representations, respectively. In addition, we design a Sorted Matching Mean
Square Error (SM-MSE) metric to measure texture patterns in the loss function.
In the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates
structural and textural representations for the input photo and produces the
final result via a probabilistic fusion scheme. Extensive experiments on
several challenging benchmarks suggest that our approach outperforms
example-based synthesis algorithms in terms of both perceptual and objective
metrics. In addition, the proposed method also has better generalization

on popular deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), we explore a very-weakly
supervised learning framework for human segmentation task, where only an
imperfect human detector is available along with massive weakly-labeled YouTube
videos. In our solution, the video-context guided human mask inference and CNN
based segmentation network learning iterate to mutually enhance each other
until no further improvement gains. In the first step, each video is decomposed
into supervoxels by the unsupervised video segmentation. The superpixels within
the supervoxels are then classified as human or non-human by graph optimization
with unary energies from the imperfect human detection results and the
predicted confidence maps by the CNN trained in the previous iteration. In the
second step, the video-context derived human masks are used as direct labels to
train CNN. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic
segmentation benchmark demonstrate that the proposed framework has already
achieved superior results than all previous weakly-supervised methods with

geometry and information theory. There are various ways to prove Brascamp-Lieb
inequality such as heat flow method, Brownian motion and subadditivity of the
entropy. While Brascamp-Lieb inequality is originally stated in Euclidean
Space, discussed Brascamp-Lieb inequality for discrete Abelian group and
discussed Brascamp-Lieb inequality for Markov semigroups.
  Many mathematical inequalities can be formulated as algebraic inequalities
which asserts some given polynomial is nonnegative. In 1927, Artin proved that
any non- negative polynomial can be represented as a sum of squares of rational
functions, which can be further formulated as a polynomial certificate of the
nonnegativity of the polynomial. This is a Sum of Square proof of the
inequality. Take the degree of the polynomial certificate as the degree of Sum
of Square proof. The degree of an Sum of Square proof determines the complexity
of generating such proof by Sum of Square algorithm which is a powerful tool
for optimization and computer aided proof.
  In this paper, we give a Sum of Square proof for some special settings of
Brascamp- Lieb inequality following and and discuss some applications of
Brascamp-Lieb inequality on Abelian group and Euclidean Sphere. If the original
description of the inequality has constant degree and d is constant, the degree
of the proof is also constant. Therefore, low degree sum of square algorithm
can fully capture the power of low degree finite Brascamp-Lieb inequality.

distribution, and (iii) the distance via the Gaia parallax. We demonstrate the
method using 525 Kepler stars for which these measures are available in the
literature, and show that the stellar masses can be measured with this method
to a precision of $\sim$25\%, limited by the surface-gravity precision of the
granulation ""flicker"" method ($\sim$0.1~dex) and by the parallax uncertainties
($\sim$10\% for the Kepler sample). We explore the impact of expected
improvements in the surface gravity determinations---through the application of
granulation background fitting and the use of recently published
granulation-metallicity relations---and improvements in the parallaxes with the
arrival of the Gaia second data release. We show that the application of this
methodology to stars that will be observed by TESS should yield radii good to a
few percent and masses good to $\approx$10\%. Importantly, the method does not
require the presence of an orbiting, eclipsing, or transiting body, nor does it
require spatial resolution of the stellar surface. Thus we can anticipate the
determination of fundamental, accurate stellar radii and masses for hundreds of
thousands of bright single stars---across the entire sky and spanning the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram---including those that will ultimately be found to
host planets.

the past decades, is one of the quintessential ideas in the physics of

generality and has in certain scenarios even been shown to fail, depending on
the boundary profiles of the terminated system. Here, we introduce bulk numbers
that capture the exact number of in-gap modes, without any such subtleties in
one spatial dimension. Similarly, based on these 1D bulk numbers, we define a
new 2D winding number, which we call the pole winding number, that specifies
the number of robust metallic surface bands in the gap as well as their
topological character. The underlying general methodology relies on a simple
continuous extrapolation from the bulk to the boundary, while tracking the
evolution of Green's function's poles in the vicinity of the bulk band edges.
As a main result we find that all the obtained numbers can be applied to the
known insulating phases in a unified manner regardless of the specific
symmetries. Additionally, from a computational point of view, these numbers can
be effectively evaluated without any gauge fixing problems. In particular, we
directly apply our bulk-boundary correspondence construction to various
systems, including 1D examples without a traditional bulk-boundary
correspondence, and predict the existence of boundary modes on various
experimentally studied graphene edges, such as open boundaries and grain
boundaries. Finally, we sketch the 3D generalization of the pole winding number

on solid surfaces to explore various properties. Most of past works have
attributed the charge modulation to electrostatic field effect. However, some
recent reports have argued that the electrolyte gating effect in VO2, TiO2 and
SrTiO3 originated from field-induced oxygen vacancy formation. This gives rise
to a controversy about the gating mechanism, and it is therefore vital to
reveal the relationship between the role of electrolyte gating and the
intrinsic properties of materials. Here, we report entirely different
mechanisms of electrolyte gating on two high-Tc cuprates, NdBa2Cu3O7-{\delta}
(NBCO) and Pr2-xCexCuO4 (PCCO), with different crystal structures. We show that
field-induced oxygen vacancy formation in CuO chains of NBCO plays the dominant
role while it is mainly an electrostatic field effect in the case of PCCO. The
possible reason is that NBCO has mobile oxygen in CuO chains while PCCO does
not. Our study helps clarify the controversy relating to the mechanism of
electrolyte gating, leading to a better understanding of the role of oxygen
electro migration which is very material specific.

us from constructing lattice codes based on multi-dimensional lattice
partitions directly from non-binary linear codes over finite fields. In this
paper, we design lattice codes from Construction A lattices where the
underlying linear codes are non-binary irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) codes.
Most importantly, our codes are based on multi-dimensional lattice partitions
with finite constellations. We propose a novel encoding structure that adds
randomly generated lattice sequences to the encoder's messages, instead of
multiplying lattice sequences to the encoder's messages. We prove that our
approach can ensure that the decoder's messages exhibit permutation-invariance
and symmetry properties. With these two properties, the densities of the
messages in the iterative decoder can be modeled by Gaussian distributions
described by a single parameter. With Gaussian approximation, extrinsic
information transfer (EXIT) charts for our multi-dimensional IRA lattice codes
are developed and used for analyzing the convergence behavior and optimizing
the decoding thresholds. Simulation results show that our codes can approach
the unrestricted Shannon limit within 0.46 dB and outperform the previously
designed lattice codes with two-dimensional lattice partitions and existing
lattice coding schemes for large codeword length.

within the framework of the fully nonlinear potential Euler equations is
addressed. It is examined, in particular, if a modulation which appears from
nowhere (i.e., is infinitesimal initially) and generates a rogue wave which
then disappears with no trace. If so, this wave solution would be a breather
solution of the primitive hydrodynamic equations. It is shown with the help of
the fully nonlinear numerical simulation that when a rogue wave occurs from a
uniform Stokes wave train, it excites other waves which have different lengths,
what prevents the complete recurrence and, eventually, results in a
quasi-periodic breathing of the wave envelope. Meanwhile the discovered effects
are rather small in magnitude, and the period of the modulation breathing may
be thousands of the dominant wave periods. Thus, the obtained solution may be
called a quasi-breather of the Euler equations.

QU-fitting by simulating observations of two polarized sources located along
the same LOS, varying the widths of the sources and the gap between them in
Faraday depth space, systematically. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach
is used to obtain the best-fit parameters for a fitting model, and Akaike and
Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC and BIC, respectively) are adopted to select
the best model from four fitting models. We find that the combination of MCMC
and AIC/BIC works fairly well in model selection and estimation of model
parameters in the cases where two sources have relatively small widths and a
larger gap in Faraday depth space. On the other hand, when two sources have
large width in Faraday depth space, MCMC chain tends to be trapped in a local
maximum so that AIC/BIC cannot select a correct model. We discuss the causes
and the tendency of the failure of QU-fitting and suggest a way to improve it.

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) cycle-2 observations of the 12CO(3-2)
emission line with a linear resolution of ~13 pc (0""18x0""14). NGC4429 has a
relaxed, flocculent nuclear disc of molecular gas that is truncated at small
radii, likely due to the combined effects of gas stability and tidal shear. The
warm/dense 12CO(3-2) emitting gas is confined to the inner parts of this disc,
likely again because the gas becomes more stable at larger radii, preventing
star formation. The gas disc has a low velocity dispersion of
2.2$^{+0.68}_{-0.65}$ km/s. Despite the inner truncation of the gas disc, we
are able to model the kinematics of the gas and estimate a mass of
(1.5$\pm0.1^{+0.15}_{-0.35}$)$\times$10$^8$ Msun for the SMBH in NGC4429 (where
the quoted uncertainties reflect the random and systematic uncertainties,
respectively), consistent with a previous upper limit set using ionised gas
kinematics. We confirm that the V-band mass-to-light ratio changes by ~30%

relatively scarce in the literature. In this paper, we try to fill this gap and
study the effects of different covariates on the verification performance of
four recent deep CNN models using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.
Specifically, we investigate the influence of covariates related to: image
quality -- blur, JPEG compression, occlusion, noise, image brightness,
contrast, missing pixels; and model characteristics -- CNN architecture, color
information, descriptor computation; and analyze their impact on the face
verification performance of AlexNet, VGG-Face, GoogLeNet, and SqueezeNet. Based
on comprehensive and rigorous experimentation, we identify the strengths and
weaknesses of the deep learning models, and present key areas for potential
future research. Our results indicate that high levels of noise, blur, missing
pixels, and brightness have a detrimental effect on the verification
performance of all models, whereas the impact of contrast changes and
compression artifacts is limited. It has been found that the descriptor
computation strategy and color information does not have a significant
influence on performance.

recursive betting scenarios and related applications in the stock market.
Roughly speaking, drawdown is understood to mean drops in wealth over time from
peaks to subsequent lows. Motivated by the fact that this issue is of paramount
concern to conservative investors, we dispense with the classical variance as
the risk metric and work with drawdown and mean return as the risk-reward pair.
In this setting, the main results in this paper address the so-called
""efficiency"" of linear time-invariant (LTI) investment feedback strategies
which correspond to Markowitz-style schemes in the finance literature. Our
analysis begins with the following principle which is widely used in finance:
Given two investment opportunities, if one of them has higher risk and lower
return, it will be deemed to be inefficient or strictly dominated and generally
rejected in the marketplace. In this framework, with risk-reward pair as
described above, our main result is that classical Markowitz-style strategies
are inefficient. To establish this, we use a new investment strategy which
involves a time-varying linear feedback block K(k), called the drawdown
modulator. Using this instead of the original LTI feedback block K in the
Markowitz scheme, the desired domination is obtained. As a bonus, it is also
seen that the modulator assures a worst-case level of drawdown protection with
probability one.

can be carried out without reference to control theory, to make the work
accessible to this community, we use the language of feedback systems. The
takeoff point for the results to follow, which we call the Drawdown Modulation
Lemma, characterizes any investment which guarantees that the percentage
drawdown is no greater than a prespecified level with probability one. With the
aid of this lemma, we introduce a new scheme which we call the
drawdown-modulated feedback control. To illustrate the power of the theory, we
consider a drawdown-constrained version of the well-known Kelly Optimization
Problem which involves maximizing the expected logarithmic growth of the
trader's account value. As the drawdown parameter dmax in our new formulation
tends to one, we recover existing results as a special case. This new theory
leads to an optimal investment strategy whose application is illustrated via an

polarisation transfer from electron to nuclear spins to achieve nuclear
hyperpolarisation. As the electron spin of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in
diamond can be optically initialised nearly perfectly even at room temperature
and ambient conditions, new opportunities become possible by the combination of
efficient DNP with optically polarised NV centres. Among such applications are
nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of liquids, hyperpolarised
nanodiamonds as MRI contrast agents as well as the initialisation of nuclear
spin based diamond quantum simulators. Current realisations of DNP perform the
polarisation transfer by achieving energetic resonance between electrons and
nuclei via carefully tuned microwave fields or by using quasi-adiabatic
sweep-based schemes across resonance points. The former limits robustness
against control errors while the latter limits polarisation rates, making the
realisation of the applications extremely challenging. Here we introduce the
concept of Hamiltonian engineering by pulse sequences and use it for the
systematic design of polarisation sequences that are simultaneously robust and
fast. We derive sequences theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that
they are capable of efficient polarisation transfer from an optically polarised
nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond to the surrounding $^{13}$C nuclear spin
bath even in the presence of control errors, making it an ideal tool for the
realisation of the above NV centre based applications.

multiplet is typically of order 100 MeV. This is sufficient to endow the
charged components with macroscopically-observable lifetimes, and ensure an
electrically-neutral dark matter particle. We show that a commonly used
iterative procedure to compute radiatively-corrected pole masses can lead to
very different mass splittings than a non-iterative calculation at the same
loop order. By estimating the uncertainties of the two one-loop results, we
show that the iterative procedure is significantly more sensitive to the choice
of renormalisation scale and gauge parameter than the non-iterative method.
This can cause the lifetime of the charged component to vary by up to 12 orders
of magnitude if iteration is employed. We show that individual pole masses
exhibit similar scale-dependence regardless of the procedure, but that the
leading scale-dependent terms cancel when computing the mass splitting if and
only if the non-iterative procedure is employed. We show that this behaviour
persists at two-loop order: the precision of the mass splitting improves in the
non-iterative approach, but our results suggest that higher-order corrections
do not reduce the uncertainty in the iterative calculation enough to resolve
the problem at two-loop order. We conclude that the iterative procedure should
not be used for computing pole masses in situations where electroweak mass
splittings are phenomenologically relevant.

relevance at LHC for the study of vector-like quarks ($T$). These coloured
states ($C$) are present in a large number of extensions of the standard model,
in particular in composite models and in extra dimensional models. Assuming
that these bosonic states are heavier than the vector-like quarks (VLQ), we
consider their production through the process $p~p\rightarrow C\rightarrow tT$.
Large QCD production cross-sections for $C$ enable us to probe heavier masses
for the VLQ and thereby allowing to put stronger limits on the vector-like
quarks which are produced in their decay chain. We adopt a universal analysis
strategy by including leptons under the classification of `jets', thereby
limiting the bias towards a specific combination of final state. We also study
the possibility of disentangling these scenarios from supersymmetric extensions
of the Standard Model by using simple discriminants based on jet multiplicity
and missing energy. We demonstrate that a simple set of cuts are sufficient to
disentangle the VLQ signal from the backgrounds. In models with a moderate
$B.R.(C\rightarrow Tt)$, the analysis enables one to get a hint of VLQ masses
as heavy as 3 TeV.

undirected graph $G$ is a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ which approximately
preserves (i.e., up to a multiplicative stretch factor $\sigma$) distances in
$G$. Tree spanners with provably good stretch factors find applications in
communication networks, distributed systems, and network design. However,
finding an optimal or even a good tree spanner is a very hard computational
task. Thus, if one has to face a transient edge failure in $T$, the overall
effort that has to be afforded to rebuild a new tree spanner (i.e.,
computational costs, set-up of new links, updating of the routing tables, etc.)
can be rather prohibitive. To circumvent this drawback, an effective
alternative is that of associating with each tree edge a best possible (in
terms of resulting stretch) swap edge -- a well-established approach in the
literature for several other tree topologies. Correspondingly, the problem of
computing all the best swap edges of a tree spanner is a challenging
algorithmic problem, since solving it efficiently means to exploit the
structure of shortest paths not only in $G$, but also in all the scenarios in
which an edge of $T$ has failed. For this problem we provide a very efficient
solution, running in $O(n^2 \log^4 n)$ time, which drastically improves (almost
by a quadratic factor in $n$ in dense graphs!) on the previous known best
result.

arise from the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of quantum field theory. That model
possesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a
nonlinear spinor field. In the physical model, that spinor field is
anticommuting. In this contribution, we analyze both a mathematical version

that, for a rather general linear inverse problems setting, instead of the
classical Tikhonov regularization problem, one can equivalently solve a
saddle-point problem where no a priori knowledge of an explicit formulation of
the structural TV functional is needed. In particular, motivated by concrete
applications, we deduce corresponding results for linear inverse problems with

that the stress energy tensor near the horizon for the pre-Hawking radiation is
far too small to do anything to the motion of a collapsing shell. Thus the
shell will always cross the apparent horizon within a finite proper time.
Moreovall, the amount of energy that can be radiated must be less than half of
the total initial energy (if the particle starts at rest at infinity) before
the shell becomes a null shell and cannot radiate any more without becoming
tachyonic. We conclude that for any gravitational collapsing process within
Einstein gravity and semi-classical quantum field theory, the formation of the
apparent horizon is inevitable. Pre-Hawking radiation is therefore not a valid

known that spin currents generate spin-transfer torques that alter
magnetization dynamics and switch magnetic moments. The observation of similar

T_c, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field at X-band (~ 9.0 GHz) shifts

that entanglement is limited to distances of order of the localization length.
The distribution of the first entanglement level spacing shows a Gaussian-like

formation in a passive layer grown with products of metal corrosion. It
considers that an anionic species diffuses across that layer and reacts at the
corrosion front (metal-oxide interface), producing a random distribution of
compact regions and large pores, respectively represented by O (oxide) and P
(pore) sites. O sites are assumed to have very small pores, so that the
fraction $\Phi$ of P sites is an estimate of the porosity, and the ratio
between anion diffusion coefficients in those regions is $D_{\text r}<1$.
Simulation results without the large pores ($\Phi =0$) are similar to those of
a formerly studied model of corrosion and passivation and are explained by a
scaling approach. If $\Phi >0$ and $D_{\text r}\ll 1$, significant changes are
observed in passive layer growth and corrosion front roughness. For small
$\Phi$, a slowdown of the growth rate is observed, which is interpreted as a
consequence of the confinement of anions in isolated pores for long times.
However, the presence of large pores near the corrosion front increases the
frequency of reactions at those regions, which leads to an increase in the
roughness of that front. This model may be a first step to represent defects in
a passive layer which favor pitting corrosion.

Hubbard repulsion between conduction and impurity electrons, employing
perturbative renormalization methods. We have calculated the scaling equations
for the model parameters and solved them both analytically and numerically to
find how valence fluctuations renormalize these parameters. Analytical
solutions of the scaling equations yielded scaling invariants of the model
which we find to be different than the Anderson impurity model signifying
different kind of scaling trajectories of e-SIAM. The strong coupling physics
of SIAM is known to be governed by spin fluctuations and we hence analysed how
the strong coupling regime of e-SIAM is renormalized by valence fluctuations.
Doing a third order perturbative renormalization of the model gave us access to
the Kondo scale. We not only confirmed that valence fluctuations enhance the
Kondo scale but we also calculated the functional form of this dependence.
Benchmarking some of our results with numerical renormalization group
calculations, we found excellent agreement. Applying Schrieffer-Wolff
transformation, we found that the strong coupling regime of the model is
governed by spin-charge Kondo model unlike the Anderson impurity model. Our
results suggest that spin Kondo effect can co-exist with valence fluctuation
mediated charge Kondo effect.

histories (SFH) obtained from deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the bar
and in a number of fields in different directions within the inner disk. The
CMDs, reaching the oldest main sequence turnoffs in these very crowded fields,
have been obtained with VIMOS on the VLT in service mode, under very good
seeing conditions. We show that the SFHs of all fields share the same patterns,
with consistent variations of the star formation rate as a function of time in
all of them. We therefore conclude that no specific event of star formation can
be identified with the formation of the LMC bar, which instead likely formed
from a redistribution of disk material that occurred when the LMC disk became
bar unstable, and shared a common SFH with the inner disk thereafter. The

surgery, with potential applications in report generation, surgical training
and real-time decision support. Two surgeries are considered: cataract surgery,
the most common surgical procedure, and cholecystectomy, one of the most common
digestive surgeries. Tool usage is monitored in videos recorded either through
a microscope (cataract surgery) or an endoscope (cholecystectomy). Following
state-of-the-art video analysis solutions, each frame of the video is analyzed
by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose outputs are fed to recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) in order to take temporal relationships between events
into account. Novelty lies in the way those CNNs and RNNs are trained.
Computational complexity prevents the end-to-end training of ""CNN+RNN"" systems.
Therefore, CNNs are usually trained first, independently from the RNNs. This
approach is clearly suboptimal for surgical tool analysis: many tools are very
similar to one another, but they can generally be differentiated based on past
events. CNNs should be trained to extract the most useful visual features in
combination with the temporal context. A novel boosting strategy is proposed to
achieve this goal: the CNN and RNN parts of the system are simultaneously
enriched by progressively adding weak classifiers (either CNNs or RNNs) trained
to improve the overall classification accuracy. Experiments were performed in a
dataset of 50 cataract surgery videos and a dataset of 80 cholecystectomy
videos. Very good classification performance are achieved in both datasets:
tool usage could be labeled with an average area under the ROC curve of $A_z =
0.9961$ and $A_z = 0.9939$, respectively, in offline mode (using past, present
and future information), and $A_z = 0.9957$ and $A_z = 0.9936$, respectively,

the individual utilities of the miners. In the first stage, the service
provider sets the price of edge computing nodes. In the second stage, the
miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices.
We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in
each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For the uniform
pricing where the same price is applied to all miners, the existence and
uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium are validated by identifying the best
response strategies of the miners. For the discriminatory pricing where the
different prices are applied to different miners, the Stackelberg equilibrium
is proved to exist and be unique by capitalizing on the Variational Inequality
theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our

relations and assuming self-similar evolution. Predicted X-ray sky-maps are
converted into XMM event lists using an instrumental simulator. The XXL
pipeline run on the resulting sky images, produces an 'observed' cluster
catalogue over which the tests have been performed. This allowed us to
investigate the relative power of various combinations of count-rate,
hardness-ratio, apparent-size and redshift information. Two fitting methods
were used : a traditional MCMC approach and a simple minimisation procedure
(Amoeba) whose mean uncertainties are a posteriori evaluated by means of
synthetic catalogues. Results were analysed and compared to the predictions
from a Fisher analysis (FA). For this particular catalogue realisation,
assuming perfectly known scaling relations, the CR-HR combination gives
$\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ at the 10% level, while CR-HR-r$_c$-z improves this
to $\leq$ 3%. Adding a second hardness ratio improves results from the
CR-HR1-r$_c$ combination, but to a lesser extent than adding redshift
information. When all coefficients of the M-T relation (including scatter) are
also fitted, cosmological parameters are constrained to within 5-10%, and
larger for the M-T coefficients (up to a factor of two for the scatter). Errors
returned by the MCMC, by Amoeba, and by FA predictions, are in most cases in
excellent agreement and always within a factor of two. We also study the impact
of the scatter of the M-Rc relation on the number of detected clusters: for the

observations of a number of tracers (12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1)
and HCO+(4-3)), we map the differences in excitation, density and temperature
of the gas. The results show that in the immediate vicinity of the radio jet, a
fast outflow, with velocities up to 800 km/s, is occurring of which the gas has
high excitation temperatures in the range 30-55 K, demonstrating the direct
impact of the jet on the ISM. The relative brightness of the CO lines show that
the outflow is optically thin. We estimate the mass of the molecular outflow to
be 1.2 x 10^6 Msol and likely to be a factor 2-3 larger. This is similar to
that of the outflow of atomic gas, but much larger than that of the ionised
outflow, showing that the outflow is dominated by cold gas. The total mass
outflow rate we estimate to be ~12 Msol/yr. The mass of the outflow is much
smaller than the total gas mass of the ISM of IC 5063. Therefore, although the
influence of the radio jet is very significant in the inner regions, globally
speaking the impact will be very modest. We use RADEX modelling to explore the
physical conditions of the molecular gas in the outflow. Models with the
outflowing gas being quite clumpy give the most consistent results and our
preferred solutions have kinetic temperatures in the range 20-100 K and
densities between 10^5 and 10^6 cm^-3. The resulting pressures are 10^6-10^7.5
K cm^-3, about two orders of magnitude higher than in the outer quiescent disk.
The results strongly suggest that the outflow is driven by the radio jet
expanding into a clumpy medium, creating a cocoon of gas which is pushed away
from the jet axis resulting in a lateral outflow, very similar to what is
predicted by numerical simulations.

representation that is locally reducible at $p$. Ample numerical evidence is
given for this new conjecture. Further, we prove that the slopes computed by

a distance for persistence diagrams, the erosion distance. Motivated by this

  Swaps",,,,,"q-fin.RM cs.CC cs.GT q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The 2008 financial crisis has been attributed to ""excessive complexity"" of
the financial system due to financial innovation. We employ computational
complexity theory to make this notion precise. Specifically, we consider the
problem of clearing a financial network after a shock. Prior work has shown
that when banks can only enter into simple debt contracts with each other, then
this problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast, if they can also
enter into credit default swaps (CDSs), i.e., financial derivative contracts
that depend on the default of another bank, a solution may not even exist.
  In this work, we show that deciding if a solution exists is NP-complete if
CDSs are allowed. This remains true if we relax the problem to
$\varepsilon$-approximate solutions, for a constant $\varepsilon$. We further
show that, under sufficient conditions where a solution is guaranteed to exist,
the approximate search problem is PPAD-complete for constant $\varepsilon$. We
then try to isolate the ""origin"" of the complexity. It turns out that already
determining which banks default is hard. Further, we show that the complexity
is not driven by the dependence of counterparties on each other, but rather
hinges on the presence of so-called naked CDSs. If naked CDSs are not present,
we receive a simple polynomial-time algorithm. Our results are of practical
importance for regulators' stress tests and regulatory policy.

as the phase shifters provide the same phase shift to all of the subcarriers.
The existing approaches solely rely on the channel's frequency response and the
hybrid beamformers maximize the average spectral efficiency over the whole
frequency band. Compared to state-of-the-art, we show that substantial sum-rate
gains can be achieved, both for rich and sparse scattering channels, by jointly
exploiting the frequency and time domain characteristics of the massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In our proposed approach, the
radio frequency (RF) beamformer coherently combines the received symbols in the
time domain and, thus, it concentrates signal's power on a specific time
sample. As a result, the RF beamformer flattens the frequency response of the
""effective"" transmission channel and reduces its root mean square delay spread.
Then, a baseband combiner mitigates the residual interference in the frequency
domain. We present the closed-form expressions of the proposed beamformer and
its performance by leveraging the favorable propagation condition of massive
MIMO channels and we prove that our proposed scheme can achieve the performance
of fully-digital zero-forcing when number of employed phase shifter networks is
twice the resolvable multipath components in the time domain.

be weakly magnetized objects accreting matter from their low-mass companions in
the form of a disk. Albeit weak as compared to those in young neutron-star
systems, the neutron-star magnetospheres in LMXBs can play an important role in
determining the correlations between spectral and temporal properties. Parallel
tracks appearing in the plane of kilohertz (kHz) quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) frequency versus X-ray flux can be used as a tool to study the
magnetosphere-disk interaction in neutron-star LMXBs. For dynamically important
weak fields, the formation of a non-Keplerian magnetic boundary layer at the
innermost disk truncated near the surface of the neutron star is highly likely.
Such a boundary region may harbor oscillatory modes of frequencies in the kHz
range. We generate parallel tracks using the boundary region model of kHz QPOs.
We also present the direct application of our model to the reproduction of the
observed parallel tracks of individual sources such as 4U 1608--52, 4U
1636--53, and Aql X-1. We reveal how the radial width of the boundary layer
must vary in the long-term flux evolution of each source to regenerate the
parallel tracks. The run of the radial width looks similar for different
sources and can be fitted by a generic model function describing the average
steady behavior of the boundary region in the long term. The parallel tracks
then correspond to the possible quasi-steady states the source can occupy

  Aims: We aim to report new precise optical radial velocity measurements for
these planet hosts and test the overall capabilities of CARMENES.
  Methods: We combined our CARMENES precise Doppler measurements with those
available from HIRES and HARPS and derived new orbital parameters for the
systems. Bona-fide single planet systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The
multiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent dynamical model
and their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability.
  Results: We confirm or provide supportive arguments for planets around all
the investigated stars except for GJ15A, for which we find that the
post-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4
days. Although we cannot confirm the super-Earth planet GJ15Ab, we show
evidence for a possible long-period ($P_{\rm c}$ = 7025$_{-629}^{+972}$ d)
Saturn-mass ($m_{\rm c} \sin i$ = 51.8$_{-5.8}^{+5.5}M_\oplus$) planet around
GJ15A. In addition, based on our CARMENES and HIRES data we discover a second
planet around GJ1148, for which we estimate a period $P_{\rm c}$ =
532.6$_{-2.5}^{+4.1}$ d, eccentricity $e_{\rm c}$ = 0.34$_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$ and
minimum mass $m_{\rm c} \sin i$ = 68.1$_{-2.2}^{+4.9}M_\oplus$.
  Conclusions: The CARMENES optical radial velocities have similar precision
and overall scatter when compared to the Doppler measurements conducted with
HARPS and HIRES. We conclude that CARMENES is an instrument that is up to the
challenge of discovering rocky planets around low-mass stars.

the broadcasting problem of a statistical experiment. We also show that the

modern SfM pipelines that use vocabulary (Voc.) trees to quickly build the

GraphMatch does not require an expensive offline pre-processing phase to
construct a Voc. tree. Instead, GraphMatch leverages two priors that can
predict which image pairs are likely to match, thereby making the matching
process for SfM much more efficient. The first is a score computed from the
distance between the Fisher vectors of any two images. The second prior is
based on the graph distance between vertices in the underlying matching graph.
GraphMatch combines these two priors into an iterative ""sample-and-propagate""
scheme similar to the PatchMatch algorithm. Its sampling stage uses Fisher
similarity priors to guide the search for matching image pairs, while its
propagation stage explores neighbors of matched pairs to find new ones with a
high image similarity score. Our experiments show that GraphMatch finds the
most image pairs as compared to competing, approximate methods while at the
same time being the most efficient.

regularize the estimation problem, one can impose constraints on the parameters
and derive the corresponding CRBs. The correspondence between local
identifiability and FIM regularity is studied here. Furthermore the number of
FIM singularities is shown to be equal to the number of independent constraints
necessary to have a well-defined constrained CRB and local identifiability. In
general, many sets of constraints can render the parameters identifiable,
giving different values for the CRB, that are not always relevant. When the
constraints can be chosen, we propose a constrained CRB, the pseudo-inverse of
the FIM, which gives, for a minimum number of constraints, the lowest bound on
the mean squared estimation error. These results are applied to two approaches
to blind FIR multichannel estimation which allow identification of the channel
up to a scale or phase factor. These two approaches correspond to deterministic

tip by a hybridization function $\Gamma_{tip}$ that provides a Kondo screening
of its magnetic moment. The entire system is described by an Anderson-like
Hamiltonian whose low-temperature physics is accessed by employing the
numerical renormalization group approach, which allows us to obtain the
thermodynamic properties used to compute the Kondo temperature of the system.
We find two screening regimes when the adatom is close to the edge of the
zigazag graphene nanoribbon: (1) a weak coupling regime ($\Gamma_{imp}\ll
\Gamma_{tip}$), in which the edge states produce an enhancement of the Kondo
temperature $T_K$ and (2) a strong coupling regime ($\Gamma_{imp}\gg
\Gamma_{tip}$), in which a local singlet is formed, in detriment to the Kondo
screening by the STM tip. These two regimes can be clearly distinguished by the
dependence of their characteristic temperature $T^*$ on the coupling between
the adatom and the carbon sites of the graphene nanoribon ($V_{imp}$). We
observe that in the weak coupling regime $T^*$ increases exponentially with

from large, complex, and highly structured data sets. A great deal of modern
statistical work focuses on developing tools for handling such data. This paper
presents a new subfield of functional data analysis, FDA, which we call
Manifold Data Analysis, or MDA. MDA is concerned with the statistical analysis
of samples where one or more variables measured on each unit is a manifold,
thus resulting in as many manifolds as we have units. We propose a framework
that converts manifolds into functional objects, an efficient 2-step functional
principal component method, and a manifold-on-scalar regression model. This
work is motivated by an anthropological application involving 3D facial imaging

algorithm and defined parameters to characterize the level of compactness and
regularity of the rings found in this procedure. Applying this algorithm to the
GRB sample we identified three more ring like point patterns. Although, they
had the same regularity but much less level of compactness than the original
GRB ring. Assuming a stochastic independence of the angular and radial
positions of the GRBs we obtained 1502 additional samples, altogether 542222
data points, by bootstrapping the original one. None of these data points
participated in rings having similar level of compactness and regularity as the
original one. Using an appropriate kernel we estimated the joint probability
density of the angular and radial variables of the GRBs. Performing MCMC
simulations we obtained 1502 new samples, altogether 542222 data points. Among
these data points only three represented ring like patterns having similar
parameters as the original one. By defining a new statistical variable we
tested the independence of the angular and radial variables of the GRBs. We
concluded that despite the existence of local irregularities in the GRBs'
spatial distribution (e.g. the GGR) one can not reject the Cosmological
Principle, based on their spatial distribution as a whole. We pointed out the
large scale spatial pattern of the GRB activity does not necessarily re ects

the fact that the literature is not consensual on a unique formulation of the

helicity, a weak magnetic field eventually becomes fully helical. The sign of
magnetic helicity is opposite to that of the kinetic helicity - regardless of
whether or not the initial magnetic field was helical. The magnetic field
undergoes inverse cascading with the magnetic energy decaying approximately
like t^{-1/2}. This is even slower than in the fully helical case, where it
decays like t^{-2/3}. In this parameter range, the product of magnetic energy
and correlation length raised to a certain power slightly larger than unity, is
approximately constant. This scaling of magnetic energy persists over long time
scales. At very late times and for domain sizes large enough to accommodate the
growing spatial scales, we expect a cross-over to the t^{-2/3} decay law that
is commonly observed for fully helical magnetic fields. Regardless of the
presence or absence of initial kinetic helicity, the magnetic field experiences
exponential growth during the first few turnover times, which is suggestive of
small-scale dynamo action. Our results have applications to a wide range of
experimental dynamos and astrophysical time-dependent plasmas, including
primordial turbulence in the early universe.

coupling finite element and CFD models. Here we solve them simultaneously, by
recasting all the equations in the same, hyperbolic form and solving them on
the same grid with the same finite-volume numerical schemes. The proposed
compressible, multiphase, hydrodynamic formulation can employ a hierarchy of
five reactive and non-reactive flow models, which allows simple to more
involved applications to be directly described by the appropriate selection.
The communication between the hydrodynamic and elastoplastic systems is
facilitated by means of mixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the
systems, which represent physical material boundaries. To this end we derive
approximate mixed Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on
characteristic equations. The components for reactive flow and elastoplastic
solid modelling are validated separately before presenting validation for the
full, coupled systems. Multi-dimensional use cases demonstrate the suitability
of the reactive flow-solid interaction methodology in the context of
impact-driven initiation of reactive flow and structural response due to
violent reaction in automotive (e.g. car crash) or defence (e.g. explosive
reactive armour) applications. Several types of explosives (C4, Deetasheet,
nitromethane, gaseous fuel) in gaseous, liquid and solid state are considered.

it is enough to observe the solution at a fixed time and on a discrete spatial

the proofs of their asymptotic properties are based on computations of power

overlaps NGC 5903 and appears to be partly enclosed by the HI filament. Using a

southwest from the galaxy, enclosing the brightest part of the radio source.
The northern and eastern parts of this X-ray structure are also strongly

spectral index of the bright radio emission to be
$\alpha_{150}^{612}$=1.03$\pm$0.08, indicating a radiative age >360 Myr. We

multi-array continuum imaging of a unique sample of low axial-ratio radio

know the phenomenology of how the off-axis emission relates to the main radio
source. Inversion symmetric offset emission appears to be bimodal and to
originate from one of two strategic locations: outer ends of radio lobes
(Outer-deviation) or from inner ends (Inner-deviation). The latter sources are
almost always associated with edge-brightened sources. With S- and Z-shaped
sources being a subset of Outer-deviation sources this class lends itself
naturally to explanations involving black hole axis precession. Our data allow
us to present a plausible model for the more enigmatic Inner-deviation sources
with impressive wings; as for outer-deviation sources these too require black
hole axis shifts although also requiring plasma backflows into relic channels.
Evolution in morphology over time relates the variety in structures in
inner-deviation sources including XRGs. With features such as
non-collinearities, central inner-S ""spine"", corresponding lobe emission peaks,
double and protruding hotspots not uncommon, black hole axis precession,
drifts, or flips could be active in significant fraction of radio sources with
prominent off-axis emission. At least 4\% of radio galaxies appear to undergo
black hole axis rotation. Quasars offer a key signature to recognize rotating
axes. With rich haul of sources that have likely undergone axis rotation our
work shows the usefulness of low axial-ratio sources to pursue searches for
binary supermassive black holes.

a mean wind velocity in the streamwise direction. In the resulting model, the

to an outcome via one or more causal pathways with respect to some subset of
intermediate variables. The majority of the literature concerning estimation of
mediated effects has focused on parametric models with stringent assumptions
regarding unmeasured confounding. We consider semiparametric inference of a
path-specific effect when these assumptions are relaxed. In particular, we
develop a suite of semiparametric estimators for the effect along a pathway
through a mediator, but not some exposure-induced confounder of that mediator.
These estimators have different robustness properties, as each depends on
different parts of the observed data likelihood. One of our estimators may be
viewed as combining the others, because it is locally semiparametric efficient
and multiply robust. The latter property is illustrated in a simulation study.
We apply our methodology to an HIV study, in which we estimate the effect
comparing two drug treatments on a patient's average log CD4 count mediated by
the patient's level of adherence, but not by previous experience of toxicity,
which is clearly affected by which treatment the patient is assigned to, and

curvature properties of (Sobolev Lie) groups of maps from a Riemannian manifold
into a compact Lie group. We are mainly interested in critical cases which are
relevant to quantum field theory. For example Freed showed that, in a
necessarily qualified sense, the quotient space $W^{1/2}(S^1,K)/K$ is a
(positive constant) Einstein `manifold' with respect to the essentially unique
PSU(1,1) invariant metric, where $W^{s}$ denotes maps of $L^2$ Sobolev order s.
In a similarly qualified sense, and in addition making use of the Dixmier
trace/Wodzicki residue, we show that for a Riemann surface Sigma,
$W^1(\Sigma,K)/K$ is a (positive constant) Einstein `manifold' with respect to
the essentially unique conformally invariant metric. As in the one dimensional
case, invariance implies Einstein, but the sign of the Ricci curvature has to
be computed. Because of the qualifications involved in these statements, in
practice it is necessary to consider curvature for $W^s(\Sigma,K)$ for s above
the critical exponent, and limits. The formula we obtain is surprisingly
simple.

intermediate models derived from the consensus analysis of multi-agent systems.
The stability result is applicable to the estimation of the maximum allowable
inter-sampling periods and time delays based on individual dynamics and
coupling structures in the scenarios of consensus control via asynchronous
sampling of relative states and asynchronous broadcasting of self-sampled
states respectively. The asynchrony of aperiodic sampling and the existence of
measurement errors allow the utilization of some kinds of quantizing devices,
such as Logarithmic quantizers, in the process of data sampling, and allow the
introduction of a period of dwell time after each update of state measurement
to eliminate the Zeno behavior of events in event-based control. The extension
in the case with input saturations and input delays is also discussed.

Private Stream Aggregation (PSA), first introduced by Shi et al. 2017. This is
a computationally secure protocol for the collection and aggregation of data in
a distributed network and has a very small communication cost. In the
non-adaptive query model, a secure PSA scheme can be built upon any
key-homomorphic weak pseudo-random function as shown by Valovich 2017, yielding
security guarantees in the standard model which is in contrast to Shi et. al.
We show that every mechanism which preserves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential
privacy in effect preserves computational $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential
privacy when it is executed through a secure PSA scheme. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel perturbation mechanism based on the symmetric Skellam
distribution that is suited for preserving differential privacy in the
distributed setting, and find that its performances in terms of privacy and
accuracy are comparable to those of previous solutions. On the other hand, we
leverage its specific properties to construct a computationally efficient
prospective post-quantum protocol for differentially private time-series data

the hardness of a new variant of the Decisional Learning with Errors (DLWE)

modeling has turned out to be of great help. In particular, stochastic 3D
microstructure models have proven to be a powerful and very flexible tool to
generate various kinds of particle-based structures. Recently, such models have
been proposed for the microstructure of anodes in lithium-ion energy and power

3D microstructure of cathodes in a lithium-ion energy cell, which differs
significantly from the one observed in anodes. The model for the cathode data
enhances the ideas of the anode models, which have been developed so far. It is
calibrated using 3D tomographic image data from pristine as well as two aged
cathodes. A validation based on morphological image characteristics shows that
the model is able to realistically describe both, the microstructure of
pristine and aged cathodes. Thus, we conclude that the model is suitable to
generate virtual, but realistic microstructures of lithium-ion cathodes.
