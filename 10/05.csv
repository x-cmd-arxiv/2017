orbital effects can be effectively taken into account in a one-dimensional

criterion. We focus on the energy splitting between two Majorana fermions in a
finite nanowire and find a striking interplay between orbital and Zeeman
effects on this splitting. In the limit of strong spin-orbit interaction, we
find regimes where the amplitude of the oscillating splitting stays constant or
even decays with increasing magnetic field, in stark contrast to the commonly
studied case where orbital effects of the magnetic field are neglected. The
period of these oscillations is found to be almost constant in many parameter
regimes.

photosphere as a changing sunspot cycle featuring roughly an 11 year period. In
addition we know that our host star also harbours small-scale magnetic fields
often seen as strong concentrations of magnetic flux reaching kG field
strengths. These features are situated in inter-granular lanes where they show
up bright as so-called magnetic bright points (MBPs). In this short paper we
wish to analyse a homogenous nearly 10 year long synoptic Hinode image data set
recorded from November 2006 up to February 2016 in the G-band to inspect the
relationship between the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre and the
relative sunspot number.
  Our findings suggest that indeed the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre
is correlated to the relative sunspot number, but with the particular feature
of showing two different temporal shifts between the decreasing phase of cycle
23 including the minimum and the increasing phase of cycle 24 including the
maximum. While the former is shifted by about 22 months the later is only
shifted by less than 12 months. Moreover, we introduce and discuss an
analytical model to predict the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre purely
depending on the evolution of the relative sunspot number as well as the
temporal change of the relative sunspot number and two background parameters
describing a possibly acting surface dynamo as well as the strength of the
magnetic field diffusion. Finally, we are able to confirm the plausibility of
the temporal shifts by a simplistic random walk model.
  The main conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the injection of
magnetic flux, coming from active regions as represented by sunspots, happens
on faster time scales than the removal of small-scale magnetic flux elements
later on.

many quantum-like features of hydrodynamic excitations can be explained in the
framework of the parametrically driven nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation
(DNLSE). It is shown that the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLSE)
describes the pseudoquantum features of a given pseudoparticle in the Sagdeev
pseudopotential just as the ordinary linear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (LSE)
describes the quantum nature of real particles. The NLSE is shown to reduce to
nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (NHJE) for the phase function of the complex
wavefunction. The origin of the wave-particle dual-character in both LSE and
NLSE is explained and basic similarities between the two models is highlighted.
It is shown that many more pseudoquantum effects (yet to be explored) such as
pseudoentanglement, self-interference effect and quantization of pseudoparticle
energy are inherent features of classical fluids. Current investigation
suggests that emergence of the quantum nature of fluids is independent from
dynamics of the bouncing droplets or their interactions with the surface waves
instantaneously created by them. In contrast to previous suggestions, it is
remarked that intrinsically nonlinear collective excitations of a fluid can
drive any particle even a pseudoparticle to behave quantum mechanically. These
collective interactions in hydrodynamic model confirm the important nonlocal
character (which is a key aspect of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory) of
all the pseudoquantum phenomena. The recent hydrodynamic quantum analog

minimize complicity of the system by eliminating irrelevant and strongly
coupled levels by detuning them from one-another. Such a three-level system,
for instance, can be mapped onto physical in form of a three-waveguide system.
Actively detuning the coupling strength between the respective waveguide modes
allows modulating light propagating through the device, as proposed here. The
outer waveguides act as an effective two- photonic-mode system similar to
ground- and excited states of a three-level atomic system, whilst the center
waveguide is partially plasmonic. In adiabatic elimination regime, the
amplitude of the middle waveguide oscillates much faster in comparison to the
outer waveguides leading to a vanishing field build up. As a result, the middle
waveguide becomes a dark state and hence a low insertion-loss of 8 decibel is
expected to keep when achieving the modulation depth as high as 70 decibel
despite the involvement of a plasmonic waveguide in the design presented here.
The modulation mechanism relies on switching this waveguide system from a
critical coupling regime to adiabatic elimination condition via
electrostatically tuning the free-carrier concentration and hence the optical
index of a thin ITO layer residing in the plasmonic center waveguide. This
alters the effective coupling length and the phase mismatching condition thus
modulation in each of outer waveguides. Our results show a modulator energy
efficiency as low as 40 atto-joule per bit and an extinction ratio of 50
decibel. Given the minuscule footprint of the modulator, the resulting
lumped-element limited RC delay is expected to exceed 200 giga hertz. This type
of modulator paves the way for next-generation both energy-and speed conscience

the EoS from 460 to $>1300$~ms and is delayed in multiple dimensions for
$\sim~100-250$~ms due to the finite entropy effects. Depending on the EoS, our
simulations show the possibility that shock revival can occur along with the
collapse of the proto-neutron star~(PNS) to a BH. The gravitational waveforms
contain four major features that are similar to previous studies but show
extreme values: (1)~a low frequency signal ($\sim~300-500$~Hz) from core-bounce

among other features, (3)~a high frequency signal from the PNS inner-core

of the latent class model in order to understand the behavior of the maximum
likelihood estimator. In particular, we characterize the boundary
stratification of the binary latent class model with a binary hidden variable.
For small models, such as for three binary observed variables, we show that
this stratification allows exact computation of the maximum likelihood
estimator. In this case we use simulations to study the maximum likelihood
estimation attraction basins of the various strata. Our theoretical study is
complemented with a careful analysis of the EM fixed point ideal which provides
an alternative method of studying the boundary stratification and maximizing
the likelihood function. In particular, we compute the minimal primes of this
ideal in the case of a binary latent class model with a binary or ternary
hidden random variable.

ranging from the detection of dirty bombs in public places to scanning critical

number of spatially separated point sources, most of the existing algorithms
fail to localize sources in complex scenarios with a large number of point
sources or non-trivial distributions & bulk sources. Even in simpler
environments, most existing algorithms are not scalable to larger regions
and/or higher dimensional spaces. For effective autonomous inspection, we not
only need to estimate the positions of the sources, but also the number,
distribution, and intensities of each of them. In this paper, we present a
novel algorithm for the robust localization of an arbitrary distribution of
radiation sources using multi-layer sequential Monte Carlo methods coupled with
suitable clustering algorithms. We achieve near-perfect accuracy, in terms of
F1-scores (> 0.95), while allowing the algorithm to scale, both to large

continuous distributions is required. A number of such models have been
described in the literature using extensions of the Dirichlet process and
related processes, typically as a distribution on the parameters of a mixing
kernel. We propose a new hierarchical model based on the P\'olya tree, which
allows direct modeling of densities and enjoys some computational advantages
over the Dirichlet process. The P\'olya tree also allows more flexible modeling
of the variation between samples, providing more informed shrinkage and
permitting posterior inference on the dispersion function, which quantifies the
variation among sample densities. We also show how the model can be extended to
cluster samples in situations where the observed samples are believed to have

In this
paper, we use short-term spectral characteristics of lung sounds to recognize
associated diseases. Motivated by the success of auditory perception based
techniques in speech signal classification, we represent time-frequency
information of lung sounds using mel-scale warped spectral coefficients, called
here as mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs). Next, we employ local
binary pattern analysis (LBP) to capture texture information of the MFSCs, and
the feature vectors are subsequently derived using histogram representation.
The proposed features are used with three well-known classifiers in this field:
k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector
machine (SVM). Also, the performance was tested with multiple SVM kernels. We
conduct extensive performance evaluation experiments using two databases which
include normal and adventitious sounds. Results show that the proposed features
with SVM and also with kNN classifier outperform commonly used wavelet-based
features as well as our previously investigated mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) based statistical features, specifically in abnormal sound
detection. Proposed features also yield better results than morphological
features and energy features computed from rational dilation wavelet
coefficients. The Bhattacharyya kernel performs considerably better than other
kernels. Further, we optimize the configuration of the proposed feature
extraction algorithm. Finally, we have applied mRMR (minimum-redundancy
maximum-relevancy) based feature selection method to remove redundancy in the
feature vector which makes the proposed method computationally more efficient
without any degradation in the performance. The overall performance gain is up

  Shared Bands","Accepted to IEEE PIMRC 2017",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LTE Unlicensed (LTE-U) in shared or unlicensed bands
has drawn growing attention from both academia and industry. An important
consideration is fairness between Wi-Fi and duty cycled LTE-U, which is often
defined in terms of channel access time, as adopted by the LTE-U Forum. Despite
many studies on duty cycle adaptation design for fair sharing, one crucial fact
has often been neglected: LTE-U systems unilaterally control LTE-U duty cycles;
hence, as self- interested users, they have incentives to misbehave, e.g.,
transmitting with a larger duty cycle that exceeds a given limit, so as to gain
a greater share in channel access time and throughput. In this paper, we
propose a scheme that allows the spectrum manager managing the shared bands to
estimate the duty cycle of a target LTE-U cell based on PHY layer observations
from a nearby Wi-Fi AP, without interrupting normal Wi-Fi operations. We
further propose a thresholding scheme to detect duty cycling misbehavior (i.e.,
determining if the duty cycle exceeds the assigned limit), and analyze its
performance in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities. The proposed
schemes are implemented in ns3 and evaluated with extensive simulations. Our
results show that the proposed scheme provides an estimate within +/- 1% of the
true duty cycle, and detects misbehavior with a duty cycle 2.8% higher than the
limit with a detection probability of at least 95%, while keeping the false
alarm probability less than or equal to 1%.

condensates realized in the dye microcavity system, thermalization does not
occur by direct interaction of the condensate particles as in the above
described systems, i.e. photon-photon interactions, but by absorption and
re-emission processes on the dye molecules, which act as a heat reservoir.
Currently, there is no experimental evidence for superfluidity in the dye
microcavity system, though effective photon interactions have been observed
from thermo-optic effects in the dye medium. In this work, we theoretically
investigate the implications of effective thermo-optic photon interactions, a
temporally delayed and spatially non-local effect, on the photon condensate,
and derive the resulting Bogoliubov excitation spectrum. The calculations
suggest a linear photon dispersion at low momenta, fulfilling the Landau's
criterion of superfluidity . We envision that the temporally delayed and
long-range nature of the thermo-optic photon interaction offer perspectives for
novel quantum fluid phenomena.

targets and in the remainder of the wide 5.5' $\times$ 5.5' GMOS field of view.
This allowed us to probe the most distant region where planetary-mass
companions could be gravitationally bound to the targets. This region was left
largely unstudied by past high-contrast imaging surveys, which probed much
closer-in separations. This survey led to the discovery of a planetary-mass
(9-13 $\,M_{\rm{Jup}}$) companion at 2000 au from the M3V star GU Psc, a highly
probable member of ABDMG. No other substellar companions were identified. These
results allowed us to constrain the frequency of distant planetary-mass
companions (5-13 $\,M_{\rm{Jup}}$) to 0.84$_{-0.66}^{+6.73}$% (95% confidence)
at semimajor axes between 500 and 5000 au around young K5-L5 stars and brown
dwarfs. This is consistent with other studies suggesting that gravitationally
bound planetary-mass companions at wide separations from low-mass stars are
relatively rare.

perform certain actions on online sites. However, due to many competing factors
influencing user temporal dynamics, it is difficult to determine whether the
badge had (or will have) the intended effect or not.
  In this paper, we introduce two complementary approaches for determining
badge influence on users. In the first one, we cluster users' temporal traces
(represented with point processes) and apply covariates (user features) to
regularize results. In the second approach, we first classify users' temporal
traces with a novel statistical framework, and then we refine the
classification results with a semi-supervised clustering of covariates.
  Outcomes obtained from an evaluation on synthetic datasets and experiments on
two badges from a popular Q&A platform confirm that it is possible to validate,

Multiple quantiles are estimated to form 10%, to 90% prediction intervals which
are evaluated using a quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models

the problem starting from appropriate Cauchy data for the Einstein vacuum

representing the expected geometry just inside the event horizon. We prove that
for all such data, the maximal Cauchy evolution can be extended across a
non-trivial piece of Cauchy horizon as a Lorentzian manifold with continuous

only that the black hole event horizon geometry suitably asymptotes to a
rotating Kerr solution. In particular, if the exterior region of the Kerr

will follow that the $C^0$-inextendibility formulation of Penrose's celebrated
strong cosmic censorship conjecture is in fact false. The proof suggests,
however, that the $C^0$-metric Cauchy horizons thus arising are generically
singular in an essential way, representing so-called ""weak null singularities"",

we study the goodness of approximation between the proposed curvature metrics

results suggest that in comparison to an alternative curvature metric for

by using certain kind of fine-tuning and embedding techniques and at a small

of stars is remarkably well fit by an isothermal sphere with moderate

radius of $1.2\pm0.1$ pc and a central density of ~200 stars pc$^{-3}$. The
distribution of stars is mildly mass segregated. However, there is no radial
stratification of the stars by age. Although most of the stars belong to a
single cluster, a small subcluster of stars is found superimposed on the main
cluster, and there are clumpy non-isotropic distributions of stars outside ~4
core radii. When the size, mass, and age of NGC 6231 are compared to other
young star clusters and subclusters in nearby active star-forming regions, it
lies at the high-mass end of the distribution but along the same trend line.

shock does not revive and a black hole forms. Neutrino emission during the
protoneutron star phase causes a decrease in the gravitational mass of the
core, resulting in an outward going sound pulse that steepens into a shock as
it travels out through the star. We explore the properties of this mass
ejection mechanism over a range of stellar progenitors using
spherically-symmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations that treat
neutrino mass loss parametrically and follow the shock propagation over the
entire star. We find that all types of stellar progenitor can eject mass
through this mechanism. The ejected mass is a decreasing function of the
surface gravity of the star, ranging from several $M_\odot$ for red supergiants
to $\sim 0.1M_\odot$ for blue supergiants and $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot $ for
Wolf-Rayet stars. We find that the final shock energy at the surface is a
decreasing function of the core-compactness, and is $\lesssim 10^{47}-10^{48}$
erg in all cases. In progenitors with a sufficiently large envelope, high
core-compactness, or a combination of both, the sound pulse fails to unbind
mass. Successful mass ejection is accompanied by significant fallback accretion
that can last from hours to years. We predict the properties of shock breakout
and thermal plateau emission produced by the ejection of the outer envelope of
blue supergiant and Wolf-Rayet progenitors in otherwise failed supernovae.

since the first extrasolar planets were detected. Giant planets are generally
believed to form far from their host stars, where volatile materials like water
exist in their solid phase, making it easier for giant planet cores to
accumulate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how giant planets
can migrate inward from their birth sites to short-period orbits. One such
mechanism, called Kozai-Lidov migration, requires the presence of distant
companions in orbits inclined by more than $\sim40$ degrees with respect to the
plane of the hot Jupiter's orbit. The high occurrence rate of wide companions
in hot Jupiter systems lends support to this theory for migration. However, the
exact orbital inclinations of these detected planetary and stellar companions
is not known, so it is not clear whether the mutual inclination of these
companions is large enough for the Kozai-Lidov process to operate. This paper
shows that in systems orbiting cool stars with convective outer layers, the
orbits of most wide planetary companions to hot Jupiters must be well aligned
with the orbits of the hot Jupiters and the spins of the host stars. For a
variety of possible distributions for the inclination of the companion, the
width of the distribution must be less than $\sim20$ degrees to recreate the
observations with good fidelity. As a result, the companion orbits are likely
well-aligned with those of the hot Jupiters, and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism does
not enforce migration in these systems.

These add to the total variation of the cosmological constant in the putative

constant is mostly cancelled by the membrane nucleation mechanism. If the step
size in the resulting discretuum of cosmological constants, $\Delta \Lambda$,
is in the interval $({\rm meV})^4 < \Delta \Lambda < (100 \, {\rm MeV})^4$, the
cancellation of vacuum energy can be assisted by the scanning of $\theta$. For
$({\rm meV})^4 < \Delta \Lambda < ({\rm keV})^4$ this yields $\theta <
10^{-10}$, meeting the observational limits. This scenario opens up 24 orders
of magnitude of acceptable parameter space for $\Delta \Lambda$ compared to

estimate of the amount of energy contained in the outgoing sound pulse. We then
develop a general formalism for analyzing the response of the star to centrally

apply this formalism to polytropic stellar models, finding qualitative and

our results to realistic pre-collapse massive star progenitors (both giants and
compact stars). Our analytic results for the sound pulse energy, excitation

at two different atomic densities. We confirm that the larger density system
has a smaller crossover Rabi frequency than the smaller density system. The
second theoretical approach is a set of phenomenological inhomogeneous rate
equations. We compare the results of our rate equation model to the
experimental observations in [E. A. Goldschmidt, et al., PRL 116, 113001
(2016)] and find that these rate equations provide quantitatively good scaling
behavior of the steady-state Rydberg population for both resonant and
off-resonant drive.

and compressed sensing reconstructions. Theory: Parallel imaging and compressed
sensing reconstructions become time consuming when the problem size or the
number of coils is large, due to the large linear system of equations that has
to be solved in l_1 and l_2-norm based reconstruction algorithms. Such linear
systems can be solved efficiently using effective preconditioning techniques.
Methods: In this paper we construct such a preconditioner by approximating the
system matrix of the linear system, which comprises the data fidelity and
includes total variation and wavelet regularization, by a matrix with the
assumption that is a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. Due to its
circulant structure, the preconditioner can be constructed quickly and its
inverse can be evaluated fast using only two fast Fourier transformations. We
test the performance of the preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method as
the linear solver, integrated into the Split Bregman algorithm. Results: The
designed circulant preconditioner reduces the number of iterations required in
the conjugate gradient method by almost a factor of~5. The speed up results in
a total acceleration factor of approximately 2.5 for the entire reconstruction
algorithm when implemented in MATLAB, while the initialization time of the
preconditioner is negligible. Conclusion: The proposed preconditioner reduces
the reconstruction time for parallel imaging and compressed sensing in a Split
Bregman implementation and can easily handle large systems since it is
Fourier-based, allowing for efficient computations.

deep learning) for medical image analysis. Yet, vast amounts of clinical
annotations (usually associated with disease image findings and marked using

several decades and stored in hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication
Systems. In this paper, we mine and harvest one major type of clinical
annotation data - lesion diameters annotated on bookmarked images - to learn an
effective multi-class lesion detector via unsupervised and supervised deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our dataset is composed of 33,688
bookmarked radiology images from 10,825 studies of 4,477 unique patients. For
every bookmarked image, a bounding box is created to cover the target lesion
based on its measured diameters. We categorize the collection of lesions using
an unsupervised deep mining scheme to generate clustered pseudo lesion labels.
Next, we adopt a regional-CNN method to detect lesions of multiple categories,
regardless of missing annotations (normally only one lesion is annotated,
despite the presence of multiple co-existing findings). Our integrated mining,
categorization and detection framework is validated with promising empirical
results, as a scalable, universal or multi-purpose CAD paradigm built upon
abundant retrospective medical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that detection
accuracy can be significantly improved by incorporating pseudo lesion labels
(e.g., Liver lesion/tumor, Lung nodule/tumor, Abdomen lesions, Chest lymph node
and others). This dataset will be made publicly available (under the open

trace of a dynamo has been detected on Venus, at present or in the past,
although a high surface temperature and recent resurfacing events may have
removed paleomagnetic evidence. Whether or not a terrestrial body can sustain
an internally generated magnetic field by convection inside its metallic fluid
core is determined in part by its initial thermodynamic state and its
compositional structure, both of which are in turn set by the processes of
accretion and differentiation. Here we show that the cores of Earth- and
Venus-like planets should grow with stable compositional stratification unless
disturbed by late energetic impacts. They do so because higher abundances of
light elements are incorporated into the liquid metal that sinks to form the
core as the temperatures and pressures of metal-silicate equilibration increase
during accretion. We model this process and determine that this establishes a
stable stratification that resists convection and inhibits the onset of a
geodynamo. However, if a late energetic impact occurs, it could mechanically
stir the core creating a single homogenous region within which a long-lasting
geodynamo would operate. While Earth's accretion has been punctuated by a late
giant impact with likely enough energy to mix the core (e.g. the impact that
formed the Moon), we hypothesize that the accretion of Venus is characterized
by the absence of such energetic giant impacts and the preservation of its
primordial stratifications.

conditions that guarantee ${A}(X)$ is a Pr\""ufer domain, a feature that is
reflected in the Zariski-Riemann space when viewed as a locally ringed space.
We also classify the rings ${A}(X)$ where $X$ has finitely many patch limit
points, thus giving a topological generalization of the class of Krull domains,
one that also includes interesting Pr\""ufer domains. To illustrate the latter,
we show how an intersection of valuation rings arising naturally in the study
of local quadratic transformations of a regular local ring can be described
using these techniques.

fundamental tests of physics. While quantum information science has relied on
systems with entanglement in 2D degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum bits with
polarization states, the field is moving towards ever-higher dimensions of
entanglement. Increasing the dimensionality enhances the channel capacity and
security of quantum communication protocols, gives rise to exponential speed-up
of quantum computation, and is necessary for quantum imaging. Yet,
characterization of even bipartite quantum states of high-dimensional
entanglement remains a prohibitively time-consuming challenge, as the
dimensionality of the joint Hilbert space scales quadratically with the number
of modes. Here, we develop and experimentally demonstrate a new, more complete
theory of detection in CCD cameras for rapid measurement of the full joint
probability distribution of high-dimensional quantum states. The theory spans
the intensity range from low photon count to saturation of the detector, while
the massive parallelization inherent in the pixel array makes measurements
scale favorably with dimensionality. The results accurately account for partial
detection and electronic noise, resolve the paradox of ignoring two-photon
detection in a single pixel despite collinear spatial entanglement, and reveal
the full Hilbert space for exploration. For example, use of a megapixel array
allows measurement of a joint Hilbert space of 1012 dimensions, with a speed-up
of nearly four orders of magnitude over traditional methods. We demonstrate the
method with pairs, but it generalizes readily to arbitrary numbers of entangled
photons. The technique uses standard geometry with existing technology, thus
removing barriers of entry to quantum imaging experiments, and open previously
inaccessible regimes of high-dimensional quantum optics.

This drop has been interpreted as an effect of an increasingly neutral
intergalactic medium with increasing redshift, while a LyC escape fraction
evolving with redshift. We report the result of a large VLT/FORS2 program
aiming to confirm spectroscopically a large galaxy sample at $z\geq6$ that has
been selected in several independent fields through the Lyman Break technique.
Combining those data with archival data, we create a large and homogeneous
sample of $z\sim6$ galaxies ($N=127$), complete in terms of Ly$\alpha$
detection at $>95\%$ for EW(Ly$\alpha)\geq25\AA$. We use this sample to derive
a new measurement of the LAE fraction at $z\sim6$ and derive the physical
properties of these galaxies through spectral energy distribution fitting. We
find a median LAE fraction at $z\sim6$ lower than in previous studies. The main
difference between LAEs and non-LAEs is that the latter are significantly
dustier. Using predictions of our SED fitting code accounting for nebular
emission, we find an effective Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction
$f^{eff}_{esc}(Ly\alpha)=0.23^{+0.36}_{-0.17}$ remarkably consistent with the
value derived by comparing UV luminosity function with Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
function. We conclude that the drop in the LAE fraction from $z\sim6$ to $z>6$
is less dramatic than previously found and the effect of an increasing IGM
neutral fraction is possibly observed at $5<z<6$. Based on our derived
$f^{eff}_{esc}(Ly\alpha)$, we find that the IGM has a relatively small impact
on Ly$\alpha$ photon visibility at $z\sim6$, with a lower limit for the IGM
transmission to \lya\ photons, $T_{IGM}\gtrsim0.20$, likely due to the presence
of outflows. [abdridged]

papers include prescriptions for scaling down the bet size. Such schemes are
referred to as Fractional Kelly Betting. In this paper, we take the opposite
tack. That is, we show that in many cases, the theoretical Kelly-based results
may lead to bets which are ""too conservative"" rather than too aggressive. To
make this argument, we consider a random vector X with its assumed probability
distribution and draw m samples to obtain an empirically-derived counterpart
Xhat. Subsequently, we derive and compare the resulting Kelly bets for both X

leads to identification of many cases which have the following salient feature:
The resulting bet size using the true theoretical distribution for X is much
smaller than that for Xhat. If instead the bet is based on empirical data,
""golden"" opportunities are identified which are essentially rejected when the
purely theoretical model is used. To formalize these ideas, we provide a result
which we call the Restricted Betting Theorem. An extreme case of the theorem is
obtained when X has unbounded support. In this situation, using X, the Kelly
theory can lead to no betting at all.

significantly increases the achievable dynamic range of our observations,
increasing our observing efficiency and thus better averages over
scintillation. Diffusers work in both collimated and converging beams. We

be improved while ensuring ACID semantics and without drastically sacrificing
write performance, disk utilization and query expressiveness.
  This paper presents the Synergy system that leverages schema and workload
driven mechanism to identify materialized views and a specialized concurrency
control system on top of a NoSQL database to enable scalable data management
with familiar relational conventions. Synergy trades slight write performance
degradation and increased disk utilization for faster join performance
(compared to standard NoSQL databases) and improved query expressiveness
(compared to NewSQL databases). Experimental results using the TPC-W benchmark
show that, for a database populated with 1M customers, the Synergy system
exhibits a maximum performance improvement of 80.5% as compared to other
evaluated systems.

devices, and as devices become smaller, they spend a larger fraction of their
energy on communication (transceiver usage) not computation. As an imperfect
proxy for true energy usage, we define energy complexity to be the number of
time slots a device transmits/listens; idle time and computation are free.
  In this paper we investigate the energy complexity of fundamental
communication primitives such as broadcast in multi-hop radio networks. We
consider models with collision detection (CD) and without (No-CD), as well as
both randomized and deterministic algorithms. Some take-away messages from this
work include:
  1. The energy complexity of broadcast in a multi-hop network is intimately
connected to the time complexity of leader election in a single-hop (clique)
network. Many existing lower bounds on time complexity immediately transfer to
energy complexity. For example, in the CD and No-CD models, we need
$\Omega(\log n)$ and $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ energy, respectively.
  2. The energy lower bounds above can almost be achieved, given sufficient
($\Omega(n)$) time. In the CD and No-CD models we can solve broadcast using
$O(\frac{\log n\log\log n}{\log\log\log n})$ energy and $O(\log^3 n)$ energy,
respectively.
  3. The complexity measures of Energy and Time are in conflict, and it is an
open problem whether both can be minimized simultaneously. We give a tradeoff
showing it is possible to be nearly optimal in both measures simultaneously.
For any constant $\epsilon>0$, broadcast can be solved in
$O(D^{1+\epsilon}\log^{O(1/\epsilon)} n)$ time with $O(\log^{O(1/\epsilon)} n)$
energy, where $D$ is the diameter of the network.

such as Fog Computing (FC) together to substantially reduce the latency and
energy consumption of Internet of Everything (IoE) devices running various
applications. The key feature that distinguishes the FC paradigm for smart
cities is that it spreads communication and computing resources over the
wired/wireless access network (e.g., proximate access points and base stations)
to provide resource augmentation (e.g., cyberforaging) for resource and
energy-limited wired/wireless (possibly mobile) things. Moreover, smart city
applications are developed with the goal of improving the management of urban
flows and allowing real-time responses to challenges that can arise in users'
transactional relationships. This article presents a Fog-supported smart city
network architecture called Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN), a
multi-tier structure in which the applications running on things jointly
compute, route, and communicate with one another through the smart city
environment to decrease latency and improve energy provisioning and the
efficiency of services among things with different capabilities. An important
concern that arises with the introduction of FOCAN is the need to avoid
transferring data to/from distant things and instead to cover the nearest
region for an IoT application. We define three types of communications between
FOCAN devices (e.g., interprimary, primary, and secondary communication) to
manage applications in a way that meets the quality of service standards for
the IoE. One of the main advantages of FOCAN is that the devices can provide
the services with low energy usage and in an efficient manner. Simulation
results for a selected case study demonstrate the tremendous impact of the
FOCAN energy-efficient solution on the communication performance of various
types of things in smart cities.

clustering of distant orbits in physical space, (ii) facilitate dynamical
detachment of their perihelia from Neptune, and (iii) excite a population of
long-period centaurs to extreme inclinations is well established through
numerical experiments, a coherent theoretical description of the dynamical
mechanisms responsible for these effects remains elusive. In this work, we
characterize the dynamical processes at play, from semi-analytic grounds. We
begin by considering a purely secular model of orbital evolution induced by
Planet Nine, and show that it is at odds with the ensuing stability of distant
objects. Instead, the long-term survival of the clustered population of
long-period KBOs is enabled by a web of mean-motion resonances driven by Planet
Nine. Then, by taking a compact-form approach to perturbation theory, we show
that it is the secular dynamics embedded within these resonances that regulates
the orbital confinement and perihelion detachment of distant Kuiper belt
objects. Finally, we demonstrate that the onset of large-amplitude oscillations
of orbital inclinations is accomplished through capture of low-inclination
objects into a high-order secular resonance and identify the specific harmonic
that drives the evolution. In light of the developed qualitative understanding
of the governing dynamics, we offer an updated interpretation of the current
observational dataset within the broader theoretical framework of the Planet

Gross-Witten-Wadia third-order phase transition in the unitary matrix model.
This transition is well-studied in the immediate vicinity of the transition
point, where it is characterized by a double-scaling limit Painlev\'e II
equation, and also away from the transition point using the pre-string
difference equation. Here we present a complementary analysis of the transition
at all coupling and all finite N, in terms of a differential equation, using
the explicit Tracy-Widom mapping of the Gross-Witten-Wadia partition function
to a solution of a Painlev\'e III equation. This mapping provides a simple
method to generate trans-series expansions in all parameter regimes, and to
study their transmutation as the parameters are varied. For example, at any
finite N the weak coupling expansion is divergent, with a non-perturbative
trans-series completion; on the other hand, the strong coupling expansion is
convergent, and yet there is still a non-perturbative trans-series completion.
We show how the different instanton terms `condense' at the transition point to
match with the double-scaling limit trans-series. We also define a uniform
large N strong-coupling expansion (a non-linear analogue of uniform WKB), which
is much more precise than the conventional large N expansion through the
transition region, and apply it to the evaluation of Wilson loops.

  University",,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consensus is a common method for computing a function of the data distributed
among the nodes of a network. Of particular interest is distributed average
consensus, whereby the nodes iteratively compute the sample average of the data
stored at all the nodes of the network using only near-neighbor communications.
In real-world scenarios, these communications must undergo quantization, which
introduces distortion to the internode messages. In this thesis, a model for
the evolution of the network state statistics at each iteration is developed
under the assumptions of Gaussian data and additive quantization error. It is
shown that minimization of the communication load in terms of aggregate source
coding rate can be posed as a generalized geometric program, for which an
equivalent convex optimization can efficiently solve for the global minimum.
Optimization procedures are developed for rate-distortion-optimal vector
quantization, uniform entropy-coded scalar quantization, and fixed-rate uniform
quantization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of these
approaches. For small numbers of iterations, the fixed-rate optimizations are
verified using exhaustive search. Comparison to the prior art suggests
competitive performance under certain circumstances but strongly motivates the
incorporation of more sophisticated coding strategies, such as differential,
predictive, or Wyner-Ziv coding.

the prefrontal cortex of a macaque monkey, is considered. An adult macaque
monkey is trained to perform a memory-based saccade. The objective is to decode
the eye movement goals from the LFP collected during a memory period. The LFP
classification problem is modeled as that of classification of smooth functions
embedded in Gaussian noise. It is then argued that using minimax function
estimators as features would lead to consistent LFP classifiers. The theory of
Gaussian sequence models allows us to represent minimax estimators as finite
dimensional objects. The LFP classifier resulting from this mathematical
endeavor is a spectrum based technique, where Fourier series coefficients of
the LFP data, followed by appropriate shrinkage and thresholding, are used as
features in a linear discriminant classifier. The classifier is then applied to
the LFP data to achieve high decoding accuracy. The function classification
approach taken in the paper also provides a systematic justification for using
Fourier series, with shrinkage and thresholding, as features for the problem,
as opposed to using the power spectrum. It also suggests that phase information

carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Though the uniformity of their light curves makes
them powerful cosmological distance indicators, long-standing issues remain
regarding their progenitors and explosion mechanisms. Recent detection of the
early ultraviolet pulse of a peculiar subluminous SN Ia has been claimed as new
evidence for the companion-ejecta interaction through the single-degenerate
channel. Here, we report the discovery of a prominent but red optical flash at
$\sim$ 0.5 days after the explosion of a SN Ia which shows hybrid features of
different SN Ia sub-classes: a light curve typical of normal-brightness SNe Ia,
but with strong titanium absorptions, commonly seen in the spectra of
subluminous ones. We argue that the early flash of such a hybrid SN Ia is
different from predictions of previously suggested scenarios such as the
companion-ejecta interaction. Instead it can be naturally explained by a SN
explosion triggered by a detonation of a thin helium shell either on a
near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\gtrsim$ 1.3 M$_{\odot}$) with low-yield
$^{56}$Ni or on a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\sim$ 1.0 M$_{\odot}$)
merging with a less massive white dwarf. This finding provides compelling
evidence that one branch of the previously proposed explosion models, the
helium-ignition scenario, does exist in nature, and such a scenario may account
for explosions of white dwarfs in a wider mass range in contrast to what was
previously supposed.

activity detection in multi-sensor data. Track Xplorer visualizes the results
of different classifiers as well as the ground truth labels and the video of
activities as temporally-aligned linear tracks. Through coordinated track

respect to the ground truth labels and video. Users can brush arbitrary regions
of any classifier track, zoom in and out with ease, and playback the
corresponding video segment to contextualize the performance of the classifier
within the selected region.
  Track Xplorer also contributes an algebra over track representations to
filter, compose, and compare classification outputs, enabling users to

mechanism of alignment earlier considered in terms of gas-grain interactions

first calculating the angle-dependence rotational damping and excitation
coefficients by photon absorption followed by infrared emission. We then
calculate the degree of PAH alignment for the different environments and
physical parameters, including the illumination direction, ionization fraction,
and magnetic field strength. For the reflection nebula (RN) conditions with
unidirectional radiation field, we find that the degree of alignment tends to
increase with increasing the angle $\psi$ between the illumination direction
and the magnetic field, as a result of the decrease of the cross-section of
photon absorption with $\psi$. We calculate the polarization of spinning PAH
emission using the obtained degree of alignment for the different physical
parameters, assuming constant grain temperatures. We find that the polarization
of spinning PAH emission from RN can be large, between $5-20~\%$ at frequencies
$\nu > 20$ GHz, whereas the polarization is less than $3~\%$ for
photodissociation regions (PDRs). In realistic conditions, the polarization is
expected to be lower due to grain temperature fluctuations and magnetic field
geometry. The polarization for the diffuse cold neutral medium (CNM) is rather
low, below $1~\%$ at $\nu>20$ GHz, consistent with observations by WMAP and

determined using the Swift/BAT light curve. Both datasets contain an equal
amount of 3.8 years of LAT data and NGC 4945 is detected with a similar
statistical significance of ~15 $\sigma$ in L and 14 $\sigma$ in H. However,
the slope of the gamma-ray spectrum hardens with the increase of the X-ray
flux, with the photon index $\Gamma$ = 2.47 +/- 0.07 in L and 2.11 +/- 0.08 in
H. The change is confirmed by a systematic variation of the spectral energy
distribution as well as a substantial reversal of the gamma-ray signal in
significance maps for low and high gamma-ray energies. The X/gamma-ray
correlation indicates that the gamma-ray production is dominated by the active
nucleus rather than by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. We
discuss possible locations of the gamma-ray source. We also compare NGC 4945
with other starburst galaxies detected by LAT and we note similarities between
those with active nuclei, e.g. unlikely high efficiencies of gamma-ray
production in starburst scenario, which argues for a significant contribution

$d$-dimensional generalized rotator subject to a time-dependent perturbation.
The perturbation is not assumed to be either Hamiltonian, or periodic or
quasi-periodic. The strength of the perturbation is given by a parameter
$\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$. For all $|\epsilon|$ sufficiently small, the augmented
flow has a $(2d + 1)$-dimensional normally hyperbolic locally invariant
manifold $\tilde\Lambda_\epsilon$.
  We define a Melnikov vector, which gives the first order expansion of the
displacement of the stable and unstable manifolds of $\tilde\Lambda_0$ under
the perturbation. We provide an explicit formula for the Melnikov vector in
terms of convergent improper integrals of the perturbation along homoclinic
orbits of the unperturbed system.
  We show that if the perturbation satisfies some explicit non-degeneracy
conditions, then the stable and unstable manifolds of $\tilde\Lambda_\epsilon$,
$W^s(\tilde\Lambda_\epsilon)$ and $W^u(\tilde\Lambda_\epsilon)$, respectively,
intersect along a transverse homoclinic manifold, and, moreover, the splitting
of $W^s(\tilde\Lambda_\epsilon)$ and $W^u(\tilde\Lambda_\epsilon)$ can be
explicitly computed, up to the first order, in terms of the Melnikov vector.
This implies that the excursions along some homoclinic trajectories yield a
non-trivial increase of order $O(\epsilon)$ in the action variables of the
rotator, for all sufficiently small perturbations. The formulas that we obtain
are independent of the unperturbed motions and give, at the same time, the
effects on periodic, quasi-periodic, or general orbits.
  When the perturbation is Hamiltonian, we express the effects of the
perturbation, up to the first order, in terms of a Melnikov potential. In
addition, if the perturbation is periodic, we obtain that the non-degeneracy
conditions on the Melnikov potential are generic.

negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) in the presence of a magnetic
field B parallel to an electric field E. Another predicted key effect closely
related to the chiral anomaly is the planar Hall effect (PHE), which has not
been identified in WSMs so far. Here we carried out the planar Hall
measurements on Cd3As2 nanoplates, and found that, accompanied by the large
negative LMR, a PHE with non-zero transverse voltage can be developed while
tilting the in-plane magnetic field B away from the electric field E. Further
experiments reveal that both the PHE and the negative LMR can be suppressed
synchronously by increasing the temperature, but still visible at room

grain boundaries in two dimensions based on the motion of constituent
dislocations of the grain boundaries. The continuum model consists of an
equation for the motion of grain boundaries (i.e., motion of the constituent
dislocations in the grain boundary normal direction) and equations for the
dislocation structure evolution on the grain boundaries. This model is derived
from the discrete dislocation dynamics model. The long-range elastic
interaction between dislocations is included in the continuum model, which
ensures that the dislocation structure on a grain boundary is consistent with
the Frank's formula. These evolution of the grain boundary and its dislocation
structure are able to describe both normal motion and tangential translation of
the grain boundary and grain rotation due to both coupling and sliding. Since
the continuum model is based upon dislocation structure, it naturally accounts
for the grain boundary shape change during the motion and rotation of the grain
boundary by motion and reaction of the constituent dislocations. Using the
derived continuum grain boundary dynamics model, simulations are performed for

universal set of quantum gates, in which some gates may be easily carried out,
while others are hard with a certain physical system. There is a unique
three-qubit quantum gate called the Deutsch gate~[$\mathbb{D}(\theta)$], from
which alone a circuit can be constructed so that any feasible quantum computing
is attainable. As far as we know, however, $\mathbb{D}(\theta)$ has not been

Rydberg blockade of neutral atoms, where $\theta$ can be tuned to any value in
$[0,\pi]$ by adjusting the strengths of external control fields. Using similar
protocols, we further show that both the Toffoli and CNOT gates can be achieved
with only three laser pulses. The Toffoli gate, being universal for classical
reversible computing, is also useful for QEC that plays an important role in
quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The possibility

is called the repair bandwidth of the code. By the cut-set bound, the repair
bandwidth of an $(n,k,l)$ MDS code is at least $l(n{-}1)/(n{-}k)$. There are
several constructions of MDS codes whose repair bandwidth meets or
asymptotically meets the cut-set bound. For example, Ye and Barg constructed
$(n,k,r^{n})$ Reed--Solomon codes that asymptotically meet the cut-set bound,
where $r = n-k$. Ye and Barg also constructed optimal-bandwidth and
optimal-update $(n,k,r^{n})$ MDS codes. Wang, Tamo, and Bruck constructed
optimal-bandwidth $(n, k, r^{n/(r+1)})$ MDS codes, and these codes have the

  A key idea in all these constructions is to represent certain integers in
base $r$. We show how this technique can be refined to improve the
subpacketization of the two MDS code constructions by Ye and Barg, while
achieving asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth. Specifically, when $r=s^{m}$
for an integer $s$,we obtain an $(n,k,s^{m+n-1})$ Reed--Solomon code and an
optimal-update $(n,k,s^{m+n-1})$ MDS code, both having asymptotically optimal

This paper proposes new approaches to looking for the most advisable spatial
searching radius for determining urban boundary. We found that the
relationships between the spatial searching radius and the corresponding number
of clusters take on an exponential function. In the exponential model, the
scale parameter just represents the characteristic length that we can use to
define the most objective urban boundary objectively. Two sets of China's
cities are employed to test this method, and the results lend support to the
judgment that the characteristic parameter can well serve for the spatial
searching radius. The research may be revealing for making urban spatial

and therefore are maximal distance separable (MDS for short) codes. Thus, the
number of nodes is upper bounded by $2^{\fb}$, where $\fb$ is the bits of data
stored in each node. From both theoretical and practical points of view (see
the details in Section 1), it is natural to consider regenerating codes that
nearly have minimum storage of data, and meanwhile the number of nodes is
unbounded. One of the candidates for such regenerating codes is an algebraic
geometry code. In this paper, we generalize the repairing algorithm of
Reed-Solomon codes given in \cite[STOC2016]{GW16} to algebraic geometry codes
and present an efficient repairing algorithm for arbitrary one-point algebraic
geometry codes. By applying our repairing algorithm to the one-point algebraic
geometry codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower, one can repair a code of
rate $1-\Ge$ and length $n$ over $\F_{q}$ with bandwidth $(n-1)(1-\Gt)\log q$
for any $\Ge=2^{(\Gt-1/2)\log q}$ with a real $\tau\in(0,1/2)$. In addition,
storage in each node for an algebraic geometry code is close to the minimum
storage. Due to nice structures of Hermitian curves, repairing of Hermitian
codes is also investigated. As a result, we are able to show that algebraic
geometry codes are regenerating codes with good parameters. An example reveals
that Hermitian codes outperform Reed-Solomon codes for certain parameters.

the large and small mass asymptotic behavior of the mass distribution depend on
whether the collision kernel is local (the aggregation mass flux is essentially
generated by collisions between particles of similar masses), or non-local
(collision between particles of widely different masses give the main
contribution to the mass flux). We show that the non-local regime is further
divided into two sub-regimes corresponding to weak and strong non-locality. We
also observe that at the boundaries between the local and non-local regimes,
the mass distribution acquires logarithmic corrections to scaling and calculate
these corrections. Exact solutions for special kernels and numerical
simulations are used to validate some non-rigorous steps used in the analysis.
Our results show that for local kernels, the scaling solutions carry a constant
flux of mass due to aggregation, whereas for the non-local case there is a
correction to the constant flux exponent. Our results suggest that for general
scale-invariant kernels, the universality classes of mass distributions are
labeled by two parameters: the homogeneity degree of the kernel and one further
number measuring the degree of the non-locality of the kernel.

the young stellar population associated to CMa R1, for which our previous

groups with different ages, suggesting a possible mixing of populations
originated from distinct star-formation episodes. The X-ray data allow the
detected sources to be characterized according to hardness ratios, light curves

and used to define a complete subsample of stellar counterparts, for
statistical purposes. A catalogue of 387 XMM-Newton sources is provided, 78%
being confirmed as members or probable members of the CMa R1 association.
Flares were observed for 13 sources, and the spectra of 21 bright sources could
be fitted by a thermal plasma model. Mean values of fits parameters were used
to estimate X-ray luminosities. We found a minimum value of log(L$_X$[erg/s]) =

M$_\odot$), being faint X-ray emitters, is incomplete. Among the 250 objects
selected as our complete subsample (defining our best sample), 171 are found to
the East of the cloud, near Z CMa and dense molecular gas, 50% of them being
young (< 5 Myr) and 30% being older (> 10 Myr). The opposite happens to the
West, near GU CMa, in areas lacking molecular gas: among 79 objects, 30% are
young and 50% are older. These findings confirm that a first episode of
distributed star formation occurred in the whole studied region ~10 Myr ago and

supergiant fast X-ray transients show relatively similar super-orbital
modulations, which are still lacking a sound interpretation. We propose that
these modulations are related to the presence of corotating interaction regions
(CIRs) known to thread the winds of OB supergiants. To test this hypothesis, we
couple the outcomes of 3-D hydrodynamic models for the formation of CIRs in
stellar winds with a simplified recipe for the accretion onto a neutron star.
The results show that the synthetic X-ray light curves are indeed modulated by
the presence of the CIRs. The exact period and amplitude of these modulations
depend on a number of parameters governing the hydrodynamic wind models and on
the binary orbital configuration. To compare our model predictions with the
observations, we apply the 3-D wind structure previously shown to well explain
the appearance of discrete absorption components in the UV time series of a
prototypical B0.5I-type supergiant. Using the orbital parameters of
IGRJ16493-4348 which has the same B0.5I donor spectral type, the period and
modulations in the simulated X-ray light-curve are similar to the observed
ones, thus providing support to our scenario. We propose, that the presence of
CIRs in donor star winds should be considered in future theoretical and
simulation efforts of wind-fed X-ray binaries.

  compression",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various
connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters
in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep
networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable
reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models
in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and
a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number
of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure,
exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these
two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient
inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual
pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety
of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated
within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned
models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts
with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network
architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find
large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve
up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in
accuracy.

merger events produce long-lived massive remnants supported by differential

oscillation of rapidly rotating neutron stars (NS) after merger, we present an
exploratory study of fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using
the public code Einstein Toolkit. The attention is focused on qualitative
aspects of long-term postmerger evolution. As simplified test models, we use a
moderately stiff Gamma=2 ideal-fluid equation of state and unmagnetized
irrotational equal-mass binaries with three masses well below the threshold for
prompt collapse. Our high resolution simulations generate postmerger ""ringdown""
gravitational wave (GW) signals of 170 ms, sustained by rotating massive NS
remnants without collapsing to black holes. We observe that the high-density
double-core structure inside the remnants gradually turns into a
quasi-axisymmetric toroidal shape. It oscillates in a quasi-periodic manner and
shrinks in size due to gravitational radiation. In the GW spectrograms,
dominant double peaks persist throughout the postmerger simulations and slowly
drift to higher frequencies. A new low-frequency peak emerges at about 100 ms
after merger, owing to the growth of GW-driven unstable oscillation modes. The
long-term effect of grid resolution is also investigated using the same initial
model. Moreover, we comment on physical conditions that are favorable for the
transient toroidal configuration to form, and discuss implication of our
findings on future GW observation targeting rapidly rotating NSs.

spatially varying diffusivity. Due to the heterogeneity of the system, the
particle's mean displacement does not vanish even if it does not experience any
physical force. This phenomenon has been termed ""noise-induced drift"", and has
been extensively studied for one-dimensional systems. Here, we examine the
noise-induced drift in a two-dimensional anisotropic system, characterized by a
symmetric diffusion tensor with unequal diagonal elements. A general expression
for the mean displacement vector is derived and presented as a sum of two
vectors, depicting two distinct drifting effects. The first vector describes
the tendency of the particle to drift toward the high diffusvity side in each
orthogonal principal diffusion direction. This is a generalization of the
well-known expression for the noise-induced drift in one-dimensional systems.
The second vector represents a novel drifting effect, not found in
one-dimensional system, originating from the spatial rotation in the directions
of the principal axes. The validity of the derived expressions is verified by
using Langevin dynamics simulations. As a specific example, we consider the
relative diffusion of two transmembrane proteins, and demonstrate that the
average distance between them increases at a surprisingly fast rate of several
tens of micrometers per second.

individual teachers and schools to students' academic growth based on
longitudinal student achievement outcomes. There is concern, however, that
ignoring the presence of missing values, which are common in longitudinal
studies, can bias teachers' value-added scores. In this article, a flexible
correlated random effects model is developed that jointly models the student
responses and the student missing data indicators. Both the student responses
and the missing data mechanism depend on latent teacher effects as well as
latent student effects, and the correlation between the sets of random effects
adjusts teachers' value-added scores for informative missing data. The methods
are illustrated with data from calculus classes at a large public university
and with data from an elementary school district.

next use this dual correspondence to prove that the critical behavior of the

finally conjecture that such critical stability is related to the topological

availability of binaural cues. Listeners with a cochlear implant and a
contralateral hearing aid -- so-called bimodal listeners -- are amongst the
worst performers, as both interaural time and level differences are poorly
transmitted. We present a new method to enhance head shadow in the low
frequencies. Head shadow enhancement is achieved with a fixed beamformer with
contralateral attenuation in each ear. The method results in interaural level
differences which vary monotonically with angle. It also improves low-frequency
signal-to-noise ratios in conditions with spatially separated speech and noise.
We validated the method in two experiments with acoustic simulations of bimodal
listening. In the localization experiment, performance improved from 50.5{\deg}
to 26.8{\deg} root-mean-square error compared with standard omni-directional
microphones. In the speech-in-noise experiment, speech was presented from the
frontal direction. Speech reception thresholds improved by 15.7 dB SNR when the
noise was presented from the cochlear implant side, improved by 7.6 dB SNR when
the noise was presented from the hearing aid side, and was not affected when
noise was presented from all directions. Apart from bimodal listeners, the
method might also be promising for bilateral cochlear implant or hearing aid
users. Its low computational complexity makes the method suitable for
application in current clinical devices.

plasma Compton cooling during a flare in the non pulsating massive X-ray binary

slowly rotating magnetised neutron star. In quiescence, the neutron star in
4U1700-37 is surrounded by a hot radiatively cooling shell. Its presence is
supported by the detection of mHz quasi periodic oscillations likely produced
by its convection cells. The high plasma temperature and the relatively low
X-ray luminosity observed during the quiescence, point to a small emitting area
about 1 km, compatible with a hot spot on a NS surface. The sudden transition
from a radiative to a significantly more efficient Compton cooling regime
triggers an episode of enhanced accretion resulting in a flare. During the
flare, the plasma temperature drops quickly. The predicted luminosity for such
transitions, Lx = 3 x 10^35 erg s-1, is very close to the luminosity of
4U1700-37 during quiescence. The transition may be caused by the accretion of a
clump in the stellar wind of the donor star. Thus, a magnetised NS nature of
the compact object is strongly favoured.

many interaction partners. These genes usually play an essential role in gene
regulation and cellular processes. Despite recent advancements in
high-throughput technology, inferring gene networks with hub genes from
high-dimensional data still remains a challenging problem. Novel statistical
network inference methods are needed for efficient and accurate reconstruction
of hub networks from high-dimensional data. To address this challenge we
propose DW-Lasso, a degree weighted Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator) method which infers gene networks with hubs efficiently
under the low sample size setting. Our network reconstruction approach is
formulated as a two stage procedure: first, the degree of networks is estimated
iteratively, and second, the gene regulatory network is reconstructed using
degree information. A useful property of the proposed method is that it
naturally favors the accumulation of neighbors around hub genes and thereby
helps in accurate modeling of the high-throughput data under the assumption
that the underlying network exhibits hub structure. In a simulation study, we
demonstrate good predictive performance of the proposed method in comparison to
traditional Lasso type methods in inferring hub and scale-free graphs. We show
the effectiveness of our method in an application to microarray data of
\textit{E.coli} and RNA sequencing data of Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma from The

  Incentivization for Crowdsensing","22 pages, 20 figures",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the incentive mechanism design from a novel and
practically important perspective in which mobile users as contributors do not
join simultaneously and a requester desires large efforts from early
contributors. A two-stage Tullock contest framework is constructed:at the
second stage the potential contributors compete for splittable reward by
exerting efforts, and at the first stage the requester can orchestrate the
incentive mechanism to maximize his crowdsensing efficiency given the rewarding
budget. A general reward discrimination mechanism is developed for timeliness
sensitive crowdsensing where an earlier contributor usually has a larger
maximum achievable reward and thus allocates more efforts. Owning to the lack
of joining time information, two practical implementations, namely earliest-n
and termination time, are announced to the contributors. For each of them, we
formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian game in which the joining time of a
contributor is his type and not available to his opponents. The uniqueness of
Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is proved in each strategy. To maximize the
requester's efficiency, we compute the optimal number of rewarded contributors
in the earliest-n scheme and the optimal deadline in the termination time
scheme. Our contest framework is applicable not only to the closed crowdsensing
with fixed number of contributors, but also to the open crowdsensing that the
arrival of contributors is governed by a stochastic process. Extensive
simulations manifest that with appropriate reward discriminations, the
requester is able to achieve a much higher efficiency with the optimal
selection of the number of rewarded contributiors and the termination time.

investigate a bio-inorganic system, namely H2 binding to the active site of

mass scaling approach applied to different reference particle spectra. It is
found that generalized transverse mass scaling is not able to describe the
measured spectra over the full range in transverse momentum. At low $p_{\rm
T}$, deviations of $20$% or more are obtained, in particular if pions are used
as reference particles. A better scaling performance is obtained, when kaons
are used as reference particles. At high $p_{\rm T}$ all tested spectra with
the possible exception of the charged kaons exhibit a scaling behavior.
Investigating the feed-down contributions from resonance decays to the charged
pion yields reveals, that using them as reference a general scaling may not be
achievable. Our findings imply that for precision measurements of direct photon

renormalization in locally covariant algebraic quantum field theory in curved
spacetime. General vector fields are pictured as sections of natural vector
bundles over globally hyperbolic spacetimes and quantized through the known
functorial machinery in terms of local $^*$-algebras. These quantized fields
may be defined on spacetimes with given classical background fields, also
sections of natural vector bundles, in addition to the Lorentzian metric. The
mass and the coupling constants are in particular viewed as background fields.
Wick powers of the quantized vector field are axiomatically defined imposing in
particular local covariance, scaling properties and smooth dependence on smooth
perturbation of the background fields. A general classification theorem is
established for finite renormalization terms (or counterterms) arising when
comparing different solutions satisfying the defining axioms of Wick powers.
The result is specialized to the case of general tensor fields. In particular,
the case of a vector Klein-Gordon field and the case of a scalar field
renormalized together with its derivatives are discussed as examples. In each
case, a more precise statement about the structure of the counterterms is
proved. The finite renormalization terms turn out to be finite-order
polynomials tensorially and locally constructed with the backgrounds fields and
their covariant derivatives whose coefficients are locally smooth functions of
polynomial scalar invariants constructed from the so-called marginal subset of
the background fields. The notion of local smooth dependence on polynomial
scalar invariants is made precise in the text.

The variability event was also observed in the optical and UV bands but the

optical and UV bands appear to follow the variations in the X-ray band. During
the rising phase, the optical bands appear to lag behind the UV band but during

explained by an excitation of the inhomogeneously distributed deep level at the

entangling curves with singular non-smooth points that generalize cusps. Our
calculations are based on minimal surfaces that correspond to elliptic
solutions of the corresponding Pohlmeyer reduced system. For these minimal
surfaces, the entangling curve contains singular points that are not cusps, but
the joint point of two logarithmic spirals one being the rotation of the other
by a given angle. It turns out that, similarly to the case of cusps, the
entanglement entropy contains a logarithmic term, which is absent when the
entangling curve is smooth. The latter depends solely on the geometry of the
singular points and not on the global characteristics of the entangling curve.
The results suggest that a careful definition of the geometric characteristic
of such a singular point that determines the logarithmic term is required,
which does not always coincide with the definition of the angle. Furthermore,
it is shown that the smoothness of the dependence of the logarithmic terms on
this characteristic is not in general guaranteed, depending on the uniqueness
of the minimal surface for the given entangling curve.

in gauge and gravity theories, that has subsequently been extended to classical
field solutions. In nearly all previous examples, the graviton field is defined
around Minkowski space. Recently, it has been suggested that one may set up a
double copy for gravitons defined around a non-trivial background. We
investigate this idea from the point of view of the classical double copy.
First, we use Kerr-Schild spacetimes to construct graviton solutions in curved
space, as double copies of gauge fields on non-zero gauge backgrounds. Next, we
find that we can reinterpret such cases in terms of a graviton on a
non-Minkowski background, whose single copy is a gauge field in the same
background spacetime. The latter type of double copy persists even when the
background is not of Kerr-Schild form, and we provide examples involving
conformally flat metrics. Our results will be useful in extending the remit of
the double copy, including to possible cosmological applications.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 14308 (2012)], we model active turbulence by means of a
generalized Navier-Stokes equation. Two-point velocity statistics of active
turbulence, both in the Eulerian and the Lagrangian frame, is explored. We
characterize the scale-dependent features of two-point statistics in this
system. Furthermore, we extend this statistical study with measurements of
vortex dynamics in this system. Our observations suggest that the large-scale
statistics of active turbulence is close to Gaussian with sub-Gaussian tails.

$g,h\in G$. We denote the fixed field $k(x_g : g\in G)^G$ by $k(G)$. Noether's

is well-known that if $C(G)$ is stably rational over $C$, then all the

$H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)$ where $G$ is any group of order $p^5$ with $p=3, 5, 7$.
Theorem 1. Let $G$ be a group of order $3^5$. Then $H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)\neq 0$

semimetals to produce surface and 3D quantized Hall effects in which the
electronic currents flow unidirectionally along the surface of the material.
This phenomenology is based on the fact that, irrespective of its orientation,
a strong magnetic field gives rise to a zero Landau level with huge 2D
degeneracy of states in the nodal-line semimetal. When the magnetic field is
perpendicular to the plane of the nodal line, we show that the evanescent
states within the nodal ring are transmuted into Landau surface states which
correspond to exceptional points, i.e. branch points which arise upon extension
of the spectrum to complex values of the momentum. These Landau surface states
are then topologically protected, as the branch cuts in the complex plane lead
to a spectrum with the topology of a torus which cannot be modified by smooth
perturbations. When the magnetic field is parallel to the nodal ring, we find
instead that the evanescent waves are paired inside the bulk of the semimetal,
leading to a 3D quantum Hall effect in which Landau states extended over 2D
slices of the 3D bulk form a flat level, but start to get some dispersion as
they approach the surface of the material. We show that, for both orientations
of the magnetic field, the transverse Hall conductivity is quantized in units
of $e^2/h$, with very large values of the Chern number which afford very high
conductivities along the surface of the 3D material.

exactness of penalty and augmented Lagrangian functions, and derive the
localization principle in the extended form. The main idea behind the extended
exactness consists in an extension of the original constrained optimization
problem by adding some extra variables, and then construction of a
penalty/augmented Lagrangian function for the extended problem. This approach
allows one to design extended penalty/augmented Lagrangian functions having
some useful properties (such as smoothness), which their counterparts for the
original problem might not possess. In turn, the global exactness of such
extended merit functions can be easily proved with the use of the localization
principle presented in this paper, which reduces the study of global exactness
to a local analysis of a merit function based on sufficient optimality
conditions and constraint qualifications. We utilize the localization principle
in order to obtain simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the global
exactness of the extended penalty function introduced by Huyer and Neumaier,
and in order to construct a globally exact continuously differentiable
augmented Lagrangian function for nonlinear semidefinite programming problems.

energy difference between different atoms can be as large as 80 meV. In

adsorption energy of either electron or hole doped samples is substantially
increased. We also find that the adsorption energy increases with the decrease
of the rotated angle between the layers. Finally, the large zero point energy

this paper, we present a new dataset and preliminary quantitative analysis of
the thematic content of JHB from the perspectives of geography, organisms, and
thematic fields. The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB
has increased steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content
of JHB articles remains strongly lopsided toward the United States, United
Kingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much less dramatically over
time. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily
between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader
patterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research
literature. Finally, we used a combination of topic modeling and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques to develop a model of multi-article fields
within JHB. We found evidence for directional changes in the representation of
fields on multiple scales. The diversity of JHB with regard to the
representation of thematic fields has increased overall, with most of that
diversification occurring in recent years. Drawing on the dataset generated in
the course of this analysis, as well as web services in the emerging digital
history and philosophy of science ecosystem, we have developed an interactive
web platform for exploring the content of JHB, and we provide a brief overview
of the platform in this article. As a whole, the data and analyses presented
here provide a starting-place for further critical reflection on the evolution
of the history of biology over the past half-century.

sample of 19 southern starburst galaxies at moderate redshifts ($0.067 < z <
0.227$) with the aim of separating synchrotron and free-free emission
components. Using a Bayesian framework we find the radio continuum is rarely
characterised well by a single power law, instead often exhibiting low
frequency turnovers below 500\,MHz, steepening at mid-to-high frequencies, and
a flattening at high frequencies where free-free emission begins to dominate
over the synchrotron emission. These higher order curvature components may be
attributed to free-free absorption across multiple regions of star formation
with varying optical depths. The decomposed synchrotron and free-free emission
components in our sample of galaxies form strong correlations with the
total-infrared bolometric luminosities. Finally, we find that without
accounting for free-free absorption with turnovers between 90 to 500\,MHz the
radio-continuum at low frequency ($\nu < 200$\,MHz) could be overestimated by
upwards of a factor of twelve if a simple power law extrapolation is used from
higher frequencies. The mean synchrotron spectral index of our sample is
constrained to be $\alpha=-1.06$, which is steeper then the canonical value of
$-0.8$ for normal galaxies. We suggest this may be caused by an intrinsically
steeper cosmic ray distribution.

predetermined protocol. The input is distributed in such a way that each player
$i$ sees all of it except $x_i$. In the simultaneous setting, the players
cannot speak to each other but instead send information to a referee. The
referee does not know the players' input, and cannot give any information back.
At the end, the referee must be able to recover $F(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ from what
she obtained.
  A central open question, called the $\log n$ barrier, is to find a function
which is hard to compute for $polylog(n)$ or more players (where the $x_i$'s
have size $poly(n)$) in the simultaneous NOF model. This has important
applications in circuit complexity, as it could help to separate $ACC^0$ from
other complexity classes. One of the candidates belongs to the family of
composed functions. The input to these functions is represented by a $k\times
(t\cdot n)$ boolean matrix $M$, whose row $i$ is the input $x_i$ and $t$ is a
block-width parameter. A symmetric composed function acting on $M$ is specified
by two symmetric $n$- and $kt$-variate functions $f$ and $g$, that output
$f\circ g(M)=f(g(B_1),\dots,g(B_n))$ where $B_j$ is the $j$-th block of width
$t$ of $M$. As the majority function $MAJ$ is conjectured to be outside of
$ACC^0$, Babai et. al. suggested to study $MAJ\circ MAJ_t$, with $t$ large
enough.
  So far, it was only known that $t=1$ is not enough for $MAJ\circ MAJ_t$ to
break the $\log n$ barrier in the simultaneous deterministic NOF model. In this
paper, we extend this result to any constant block-width $t>1$, by giving a
protocol of cost $2^{O(2^t)}\log^{2^{t+1}}(n)$ for any symmetric composed
function when there are $2^{\Omega(2^t)}\log n$ players.

The RVM's are motivated from the renormalization group formalism of Quantum
Field Theory in curved spacetime. In this theoretical framework, the vacuum
energy density depends explicitly on the Hubble function and its time
derivative and thus does not remain constant, in contradistinction to the
standard $\Lambda$CDM picture. Upon studying how these models fit the data, we
can determine whether this dynamical behavior is favored by observations or
not. Is the vacuum energy density (or more generically, the DE density)
dynamical? One of the main conclusions of this dissertation is that we have
indeed strong evidences in favor of the variability of the DE density
throughout the cosmic history. It is shown that this variation can also be
traced through other (purely phenomenological) dynamical vacuum models,
together with different parametrizations of the DE (as the XCDM and CPL), and
scalar field models as the Peebles-Ratra one. The statistical confidence level
of these evidences reaches in some cases the 3-4$\sigma$ c.l., something that
is unprecedented in the literature. An exhaustive explanation of the reasons
why large collaborations as BOSS, Planck and DES have not been able to detect
such signal in favor of the DE dynamics is provided in this thesis too.

line-lists for these molecules. The line lists available today contain for many
species up to several billions of lines. Computation of the spectral line
profile created by pressure and temperature broadening, the Voigt profile, of
all of these lines is becoming a computational challenge. We aim to create a
method to compute the Voigt profile in a way that automatically focusses the
computation time into the strongest lines, while still maintaining the
continuum contribution of the high number of weaker lines. Here, we outline a
statistical line sampling technique that samples the Voigt profile quickly and
with high accuracy. The number of samples is adjusted to the strength of the
line and the local spectral line density. This automatically provides high
accuracy line shapes for strong lines or lines that are spectrally isolated.
The line sampling technique automatically preserves the integrated line opacity
for all lines, thereby also providing the continuum opacity created by the
large number of weak lines at very low computational cost. The line sampling
technique is tested for accuracy when computing line spectra and correlated-k
tables. Extremely fast computations (~3.5e5 lines per second per core on a
standard current day desktop computer) with high accuracy (< 1 % almost
everywhere) are obtained. A detailed recipe on how to perform the computations
is given.

proximity induced s-wave superconductivity, and a Zeeman magnetic field. We

  Matrix Factorization","14 pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, the availability of large-scale data in disparate application
domains urges the deployment of sophisticated tools for extracting valuable
knowledge out of this huge bulk of information. In that vein, low-rank
representations (LRRs) which seek low-dimensional embeddings of data have
naturally appeared. In an effort to reduce computational complexity and improve
estimation performance, LRR has been viewed via a matrix factorization (MF)
perspective. Recently, low-rank MF (LRMF) approaches have been proposed for
tackling the inherent weakness of MF i.e., the unawareness of the dimension of
the low-dimensional space where data reside. Herein, inspired by the merits of
iterative reweighted schemes for rank minimization, we come up with a generic
low-rank promoting regularization function. Then, focusing on a specific
instance of it, we propose a regularizer that imposes column-sparsity jointly
on the two matrix factors that result from MF, thus promoting low-rankness on
the optimization problem. The problems of denoising, matrix completion and
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) are redefined according to the new LRMF
formulation and solved via efficient Newton-type algorithms with proven
theoretical guarantees as to their convergence and rates of convergence to
stationary points. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified in
diverse simulated and real data experiments.

extensively based on effective mass theory. However, a proper theoretical
description of the excited states of a donor cluster is still scarce. Here we
study the excitations of lines of defects within a single-valley spherical band
approximation, thus mapping the problem to a scaled hydrogen atom array. A
series of detailed full configuration-interaction and time-dependent hybrid
density-functional theory calculations have been performed to understand linear
clusters of up to 10 donors. Our studies illustrate the generic features of
their excited states, addressing the competition between formation of
inter-donor ionic states and intra-donor atomic excited states. At short
inter-donor distances, excited states of donor molecules are dominant, at
intermediate distances ionic states play an important role, and at long
distances the intra-donor excitations are predominant as expected. The
calculations presented here emphasise the importance of correlations between
donor electrons, and are thus complementary to other recent approaches that
include effective mass anisotropy and multi-valley effects. The exchange
splittings between relevant excited states have also been estimated for a donor
pair and for a three-donor arrays; the splittings are much larger than those in
the ground state in the range of donor separations between 10 and 20 nm. This
establishes a solid theoretical basis for the use of excited-state exchange
interactions for controllable quantum gate operations in silicon.

solution was able to meet five of our six goals soon after its implementation:
cost effectiveness, immediacy of privacy, simplicity of use, ease of execution,
and unimpaired functionality. Our final criterion of speed was sacrificed for
greater privacy but it did not fall so low as to impair day-to-day

Solution, it is possible to construct the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) of
barium and related stars with unprecedented accuracy. A direct result from the
derived HRD is that subgiant CH stars occupy the same region as barium dwarfs,
contrary to what their designations imply. By comparing the position of barium
stars in the HRD with STAREVOL evolutionary tracks, it is possible to evaluate
their masses, provided the metallicity is known. We used an average metallicity
[Fe/H] = -0.25 and derived the mass distribution of barium giants. The
distribution peaks around 2.5 Msun with a tail at higher masses up to 4.5 Msun.
This peak is also seen in the mass distribution of a sample of normal K and M
giants used for comparison and is associated with stars located in the red
clump. When we compare these mass distributions, we see a deficit of low-mass
(1 - 2 Msun) barium giants. This is probably because low-mass stars reach large
radii at the tip of the red giant branch, which may have resulted in an early
binary interaction. Among barium giants, the high-mass tail is however
dominated by stars with barium indices of less than unity, based on a visual
inspection of the barium spectral line; that is, these stars have a very
moderate barium line strength. We believe that these stars are not genuine
barium giants, but rather bright giants, or supergiants, where the barium lines
are strengthened because of a positive luminosity effect. Moreover, contrary to
previous claims, we do not see differences between the mass distributions of
mild and strong barium giants.

smart cities, and social networks, generate vast amounts of data. Such data are
not only unbounded and rapidly evolving. Rather, the content thereof
dynamically evolves over time, often in unforeseen ways. These variations are
due to so-called concept drifts, caused by changes in the underlying data
generation mechanisms. In a classification setting, concept drift causes the
previously learned models to become inaccurate, unsafe and even unusable.
Accordingly, concept drifts need to be detected, and handled, as soon as
possible. In medical applications and emergency response settings, for example,
change in behaviours should be detected in near real-time, to avoid potential
loss of life. To this end, we introduce the McDiarmid Drift Detection Method
(MDDM), which utilizes McDiarmid's inequality in order to detect concept drift.
The MDDM approach proceeds by sliding a window over prediction results, and
associate window entries with weights. Higher weights are assigned to the most
recent entries, in order to emphasize their importance. As instances are
processed, the detection algorithm compares a weighted mean of elements inside
the sliding window with the maximum weighted mean observed so far. A
significant difference between the two weighted means, upper-bounded by the
McDiarmid inequality, implies a concept drift. Our extensive experimentation
against synthetic and real-world data streams show that our novel method
outperforms the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MDDM yields shorter detection
delays as well as lower false negative rates, while maintaining high

electromagnetic field. A first result at the classical level is that the
symmetry of the geometry need not be applied on the electromagnetic tensor
$F_{\mu\nu}$; the algebraic restrictions, implied by the Einstein field
equations to the stress energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$, suffice to reduce the
general $F_{\mu\nu}$ to the appropriate form. The classical solution thus found
contains a time dependent electric and a constant magnetic charge. The solution
is also reachable from the corresponding mini-superspace action, which is
strikingly similar to the Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m one. This points to a
connection between the black hole geometry and the cosmological solution here
found, which is the analog of the known correlation between the Schwarzschild
and the Kantowski-Sachs metrics. The configuration space is drastically
modified by the presence of the magnetic charge from a 3D flat to a 3D pp wave
geometry. We map the emerging linear and quadratic classical integrals of
motion, to quantum observables. Along with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation these
observables provide unique, up to constants, wave functions. The employment of
a Bohmian interpretation of these quantum states results in deterministic
(semi-classical) geometries most of which are singularity free.

near-orthogonality regularization term. To optimize our IBCCF model, we develop

spectra are penetration spectra that describe the asymptotic depths of
penetration of geodesics in the cusps. Their study is in particular motivated
by Diophantine approximation on Fuchsian groups. In the classical case of the
modular surface and classical Diophantine approximation, Hall proved in 1947
that the classical Lagrange spectrum contains a half-line, known as a Hall ray.
We generalize this result to the context of Riemann surfaces with cusps and
Diophantine approximation on Fuchsian groups. One can measure excursion into a
cusp both with respect to a natural height function or, more generally, with
respect to any proper function. We prove the existence of a Hall ray for the
Lagrange spectrum of any non co-compact, finite covolume Fuchsian group with
respect to any given cusp, both when the penetration is measured by a height
function induced by the imaginary part as well as by any proper function close
to it with respect to the Lipschitz norm. This shows that Hall rays are stable
under (Lipschitz) perturbations. As a main tool, we use the boundary expansion
developed by Bowen and Series to code geodesics and produce a geometric
continued fraction-like expansion and mimic the key ideas in Hall's original
argument. A key element in the proof of the results for proper functions is a
generalization of Hall's theorem on the sum of Cantor sets, where we consider
functions which are small perturbations in the Lipschitz norm of the sum.

it to optimality is intractable. Thus practitioners make simplifying
assumptions and design suboptimal policies, but a thorough investigation of the
relative performance of these policies is lacking.
  To better understand such assumptions, we simulate the performance of two

realisations of the random disturbance, the often-used, but approximate,
Certainty Equivalent Control policy yields larger profits than an optimal,
maximum expected-value policy. This approximate algorithm, however, performs
significantly worse in the remaining realisations, which colloquially can be

Open-Loop Feedback Control, is shown to work well as a compromise between the
Certainty Equivalent Control and the optimal policy.

additional energy shift due to particle momenta in the ${\bar p}$-nucleus

they still remain sizable. Next, the $\bar{p}$-nucleus interaction was
constructed using the latest version of the Paris $\bar{N}N$ potential. Related

scales. We demonstrate that our simulations are capable of producing power-law
profiles close to the steep $\rho\propto r^{-9/4}$ halo profiles that are
commonly assumed to be a good approximation to ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs).
However, we show that for more realistic initial conditions in which halos are
neither perfectly symmetric nor isolated, the steep power-law profile is
disrupted and we find that the Navarro-Frenk-White profile is a better fit to
most halos. In the presence of background fluctuations even extreme, nearly
spherical initial conditions do not remain exceptional. Nonetheless, boosting
the amplitude of initial fluctuations causes all structures to form earlier and
thus at larger densities. With sufficiently large amplitude of fluctuations we
find that values for the concentration of typical halos in our simulations can
become very large. However, despite the signal coming from dark matter

J for a pair of Mn impurities. We find J to be ferromagnetic and of the order

by the U parameter (varying between 2 and 8 eV) and by the lattice relaxation.
From a detailed analysis of the magnetization density distribution we get hints
for a ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism. Also the Mn valence was found to
be 3+ without any doubt in the absence of co-doping with Mg. Co-doping with Mg
leads to a valence change to 4+ for 1 Mg and to 5+ for 2 Mg. We show that the
valence change can already be concluded from a careful analysis of the density

to meet diverse comfort requirements of the occupants. Second, heat or cool an
entire zone even when the zone is only partially occupied. Both issues can be
mitigated by using personal comfort systems (PCS) which bridge the comfort gap
between what is provided by a central HVAC system and the personal preferences
of the occupants. In recent work, we have proposed and deployed such a system,
called SPOT.
  We address the question, ""How should an existing HVAC system modify its
operation to benefit the availability of PCS like SPOT?"" For example, energy
consumption could be reduced during sparse occupancy by choosing appropriate
thermal set backs, with the PCS providing the additional offset in thermal
comfort required for each occupant. Our control strategy based on Model
Predictive Control (MPC), employs a bi-linear thermal model, and has two
time-scales to accommodate the physical constraints that limit certain
components of the central HVAC system from frequently changing their set
points.
  We compare the energy consumption and comfort offered by our SPOT-aware HVAC
system with that of a state-of-the-art MPC-based central HVAC system in
multiple settings including different room layouts and partial deployment of
PCS. Numerical evaluations show that our system obtains, in average, 45% (15%)
savings in energy in summer (winter), compared with the benchmark system for
the case of homogeneous comfort requirements. For heterogeneous comfort
requirements, we observe 51% (29%) improvement in comfort in summer (winter) in
addition to significant savings in energy.

look-up maps representing discretizations of continuous functions on metric
spaces. For example, a non-linear control action may be represented as a table
of pre-computed values, and the output action of the controller for a given
input is computed by using interpolation. For industrial-scale control systems,
several man-hours of effort is spent in tuning the values within the look-up
maps, and sub-optimal performance is often associated with inappropriate values
in look-up maps. Suppose that during testing, the controller code is found to
have sub-optimal performance. The parameter fault localization problem asks
which parameter values in the code are potential causes of the sub-optimal
behavior. We present a statistical parameter fault localization approach based
on binary similarity coefficients and set spectra methods. Our approach extends
previous work on software fault localization to a quantitative setting where
the parameters encode continuous functions over a metric space and the program
is reactive.
  We have implemented our approach in a simulation workflow for automotive

the snowline dominates the earliest stages of planet-formation, which therefore
is subject to many laboratory studies. However, the pressure-temperature
gradients in proto-planetary disks mean that the ices are constantly processed,
undergoing phase changes between different solid phases and the gas phase. Open
questions remain as to whether the properties of the icy particles themselves
dictate collision outcomes and therefore how effectively collision experiments
reproduce conditions in pro- toplanetary environments. Previous experiments
often yielded apparently contradictory results on collision outcomes, only
agreeing in a temperature dependence setting in above $\approx$ 210 K. By
exploiting the unique capabilities of the NIMROD neutron scattering instrument,
we characterized the bulk and surface structure of icy particles used in
collision experiments, and studied how these structures alter as a function of
temperature at a constant pressure of around 30 mbar. Our icy grains, formed
under liquid nitrogen, undergo changes in the crystalline ice-phase,
sublimation, sintering and surface pre-melting as they are heated from 103 to
247 K. An increase in the thickness of the diffuse surface layer from $\approx$
10 to $\approx$ 30 {\AA} ($\approx$ 2.5 to 12 bilayers) proves increased
molecular mobility at temperatures above $\approx$ 210 K. As none of the other
changes tie-in with the temperature trends in collisional outcomes, we conclude
that the surface pre-melting phenomenon plays a key role in collision
experiments at these temperatures. Consequently, the pressure-temperature
environment, may have a larger influence on collision outcomes than previously
thought.

alloys with the desired combination of strength and ductility. The main
mechanism of strengthening is generally known to be the interaction between
dislocations and precipitates. When a dislocation encounters a precipitate, it
bends and therefore the level of applied stress to the precipitate increases.
Once the applied stress reaches the precipitate resistance, it passes the
precipitate. Dislocations can bypass precipitates either by forming the Orowan
loops or by cutting them. In this research, the focus is set on a small domain
nearby precipitates to investigate their effects on the effective plastic
strain. Both penetrable and impenetrable precipitates are considered. Two
scales are coupled to model this phenomenon, the nano-micro scale where
plasticity is determined by explicit three-dimensional discrete dislocation
dynamics analysis and the continuum scale where the finite element method is
applied. With this hybrid approach, complex problems in plastic deformation of
nanostructured materials can be addressed. Finally, the relation between the
precipitate resistance and the effective plastic strain is investigated.

superposition of chiral quasi-particle states corresponding to an interacting
electron system in two dimensions (2D) in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (RSOC). I investigate its internal structure via studying the charge
and the current densities within the first order perturbation in the
electron-electron interaction. It is found that the c-QPWP contains a localized
charge which is less than the magnitude of the bare charge and the remaining
charge resides at the system boundary. The amount of charge delocalized turns
out to be inversely proportional to the degenerate Fermi velocity $v_0 ( =
\sqrt{\alpha^2 + 2\mu / m})$ when RSOC (with strength $\alpha$) is weak, and
therefore externally tunable. For strong RSOC, the magnitudes of both the
delocalized charge and the current further strongly depend on the direction of
propagation of the wave packet. Both the charge and the current densities
consist of an anisotropic $r^{-2}$ tail away from the centre of the wave
packet. Possible implications of such delocalizations in real systems
corresponding to 2D semiconductor heterostructure are also discussed within the
context of particle injection experiments.

scene point correspondences as input to a nonlinear optimization framework. We
show that our approach can reliably calibrate arbitrary video sequences by
evaluating it on datasets for which full photometric ground truth is available.

an axisymmetric flux-transport solar dynamo model in order to estimate the
large-scale meridional circulation throughout the convection zone. Our
innovative approach rests on variational data assimilation, whereby the
distance between predictions and observations (measured by an objective
function) is iteratively minimized by means of an optimization algorithm
seeking the meridional flow which best accounts for the data. The minimization
is performed using a quasi-Newton technique, which requires the knowledge of
the sensitivity of the objective function to the meridional flow. That
sensitivity is efficiently computed via the integration of the adjoint
flux-transport dynamo model. Closed-loop (also known as twin) experiments using
synthetic data demonstrate the validity and accuracy of this technique, for a
variety of meridional flow configurations, ranging from unicellular and
equatorially symmetric to multicellular and equatorially asymmetric. In this
well-controlled synthetic context, we perform a systematic study of the
behavior of our variational approach under different observational
configurations, by varying their spatial density, temporal density, noise
level, as well as the width of the assimilation window. We find that the method
is remarkably robust, leading in most cases to a recovery of the true
meridional flow to within better than 1%. These encouraging results are a first
step towards using this technique to i) better constrain the physical processes
occurring inside the Sun and ii) better predict solar activity on decadal time
scales.

set of users that own the maximum {\it influence ability} across the network.
In this paper, a novel credit distribution (CD) based model, termed as the
multi-action CD (mCD) model, is introduced to quantify the influence ability of
each user, which works with practical datasets where one type of action could
be recorded for multiple times. Based on this model, influence maximization is
formulated as a submodular maximization problem under a general knapsack
constraint, which is NP-hard. An efficient streaming algorithm with one-round
scan over the user set is developed to find a suboptimal solution.
Specifically, we first solve a special case of knapsack constraints, i.e., a
cardinality constraint, and show that the developed streaming algorithm can
achieve ($\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$)-approximation of the optimality. Furthermore,
for the general knapsack case, we show that the modified streaming algorithm
can achieve ($\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon$)-approximation of the optimality. Finally,
experiments are conducted over real Twitter dataset and demonstrate that the
mCD model enjoys high accuracy compared to the conventional CD model in
estimating the total number of people who get influenced in a social network.
Moreover, through the comparison to the conventional CD, non-CD models, and the
mCD model with the greedy algorithm on the performance of the influence
maximization problem, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
mCD model with the streaming algorithm.

of the binary pulsar and the observation of its orbital energy loss, consistent
with General Relativity. They are considered nucleosynthesis sites of the rapid
neutron-capture process (r-process), which is responsible for creating
approximately half of all heavy elements beyond Fe and is the only source of
elements beyond Pb and Bi. Detailed nucleosynthesis calculations based on the
decompression of neutron star matter are consistent with solar r-process
abundances of heavy nuclei. Neutron star mergers have also been identified with
short-duration {\gamma}-ray bursts via their IR afterglow. The high neutron
densities in ejected matter permit a violent r-process, leading to fission
cycling of the heaviest nuclei in regions far from (nuclear) stability.
Uncertainties in several nuclear properties affect the abundance distributions.
The modeling of astrophysical events also depends on the hydrodynamic
treatment, the occurrence of a neutrino wind after the merger and before the
possible emergence of a black hole, and the properties of black hole accretion
disks. We discuss the effect of nuclear and modeling uncertainties and conclude
that binary compact mergers are probably a (or the) dominant site of the
production of r-process nuclei in our Galaxy.

  Although these models are verified to high precision in the solar system
experiments, they suffer from several theoretical weaknesses and a lack of

are thus not viewed anymore as fundamental theories. As its phenomenology
involves both these extreme scales, cosmology is then a good laboratory to

explored more nuanced ways to capture emotions that go beyond polarity. For
these methods to work, they require a critical resource: a lexicon that is

experts, such as linguists and behavioural scientists, with strict rules.
Lexicon evaluation was also performed by experts or gold standards. In our

calculations but introducing the basic points with enough detail. The theory
considered is formulated in a preferred reference frame in a four-dimensional
spacetime endowed with a curved ""physical"" metric. The dynamics of a test
particle is defined by an extension of the special-relativistic form of
Newton's second law. This determines the dynamical equation verified by the
energy-momentum tensor ${\bf T}$ of a ""dust"" continuum, also in the presence of
a non-gravitational external force. The dynamical equation for ${\bf T}$ thus
obtained is assumed valid for a general continuous medium or a system of
fields. When the non-gravitational force is the Lorentz force, this equation in
turn determines the Maxwell equations in a gravitational field for the present
theory. They are consistent with the dynamics of photons i.e. with the
geometrical optics of the theory. Except for a constant gravitational field,
they seem to imply some local production or destruction of electric charge. The
possible amounts are yet to be assessed.

Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) is critical in many Urban Search and Rescue
(USAR) missions. Unfortunately, as was seen in e.g. the Fukushima disaster, the
networks available in areas where USAR missions take place are often severely
limited in range and coverage. Therefore, during mission execution, the
operator needs to keep track of not only the physical parts of the mission,
such as navigating through an area or searching for victims, but also the
variations in network connectivity across the environment. In this paper, we
propose and evaluate a new teleoperation User Interface (UI) that includes a
way of estimating the Direction of Arrival (DoA) of the Radio Signal Strength
(RSS) and integrating the DoA information in the interface. The evaluation
shows that using the interface results in more objects found, and less aborted
missions due to connectivity problems, as compared to a standard interface. The
proposed interface is an extension to an existing interface centered around the
video stream captured by the UGV. But instead of just showing the network
signal strength in terms of percent and a set of bars, the additional
information of DoA is added in terms of a color bar surrounding the video feed.
With this information, the operator knows what movement directions are safe,
even when moving in regions close to the connectivity threshold.

elastomers is one of the long-standing problems in rubber mechanics. The
classical theory of rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption of entropic
elasticity of networks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The
kinetic theories for vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect
experimental measurements all indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates
is made of polymer strands with a random distribution of length. The
polydispersity in strand length is expected to control the mechanical strength
of rubber as the overloaded short strands break at small deformations and
transfer the load to the longer strands. The purpose of the contributions
presented in this thesis is to present simple theories of rubber mechanics that
take into account the length distribution of strands and its effect on
elasticity and the onset of bulk failure in unfilled and filled elastomers. In
unfilled system, the population of short chains is identified as the culprits
for damage initiation. Upon deformation of a polydisperse network, shorter
strands break at considerably smaller stretches compared to the longer ones.
The network alteration continues concurrent with increasing deformation and
controls the onset of mechanical failure. In the filled networks, the
degradation in network mechanical behavior is assumed to be controlled by the
adhesive failure of the short strands adsorbed onto the filler surface. The
finite extensibility of the short adsorbed strands is a key determinant of
mechanical strength.

Palatini approach. Both scalar-tensor theories and Palatini formalism are means
of alternating classical theory of gravity, general relativity, in order to
account for phenomena being seemingly unexplainable on the ground of the
Einstein theory or to serve as toy models used to test limitations of the
theory in question. In the literature, both Palatini approach and scalar-tensor
theories have been widely discussed, but there are very few - if none - authors
writing about a merge of these two ideas. The present paper is a result of an
insufficient attention given to the topic of scalar-tensor theories in Palatini
formalism.
  In the course of the thesis action functional for scalar-tensor theories of
gravity will be introduced. This action functional differs significantly from
the action defined in case of scalar-tensor theories in metric approach. We aim
at analysing the theory using the language of invariants, allowing us to write
down all equations in a frame-independent manner. We discover that invariants
defined for the metric case do not always have their counterparts in Palatini
formalism. Also, two frames most frequently used in the literature are
discussed: Einstein and Jordan frame. Possible applications of the theory
developed in the first part of the thesis are presented. We show the
equivalence between $f(R)$ and scalar-tensor theories of gravity and exploit
this fact by analysing the former using methods developed for scalar-tensor
theories. We conclude the thesis with calculating the Friedmann equations for
an empty universe of vanishing spatial curvature and preparing set-up for
analysing inflationary behaviour.

situation involving repeated gestures and postures that can be described as

continuum approach to mathematical modelling of biofilm growth, the problem
consists of a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations
governing the microbial species growth and a system of semi-linear elliptic
partial differential equations describing the substrate trends. The model is
completed with a system of elliptic partial differential equations governing
the diffusion and reaction of planktonic cells, which are able to switch their
mode of growth from planktonic to sessile when specific environmental
conditions are found. Two systems of nonlinear differential equations for the
substrate and planktonic cells mass balance within the bulk liquid are also
considered. The free boundary evolution is governed by a differential equation
that accounts for detachment. The qualitative analysis is performed and a
uniqueness and existence result is discussed. Furthermore, two special models
of biological and engineering interest are discussed numerically. The invasion
of Anammox bacteria in a constituted biofilm inhabiting the deammonification
