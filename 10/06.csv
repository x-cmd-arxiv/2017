will apply our method to calculate node polynomials for plane curves
intersecting general lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$. We verify our results using 19th

ferromagnetic (FM) behavior upon replacement of Mn with Fe, consistent with

consist of chemically- and magnetically-uniform (111) planes, with Fe-rich
regions preferring FM ordering and Mn-rich regions preferring AFM ordering,
independent of the overall composition. Analysis of the electronic structure
suggests that the magnetic behavior of this alloy arises from a competition
between AFM-favoring Sn-mediated superexchange and FM-favoring RKKY exchange
mediated by spin-polarized conduction electrons. Changes in valency upon
replacement of Mn with Fe shifts the balance from superexchange-dominated
interactions to RKKY-dominated interactions.

increasing precision of these estimates. Unlike many previous approaches that

rapidly as a function of distance to the Sun. Observations show this is not the
case. In this work, a magnetic pumping model is developed as a possible
explanation for the heating and the generation of power-law distribution
functions observed in the solar wind plasma. Most previous studies in this area
focus on the role that the dissipation of turbulent energy on microscopic
kinetic scales plays in the overall heating of the plasma. However, with
magnetic pumping particles are energized by the largest scale turbulent
fluctuations, thus bypassing the energy cascade. In contrast to other models,
we include the pressure anisotropy term, providing a channel for the large
scale fluctuations to heat the plasma directly. In this work a complete set of
coupled differential equations describing the evolution, and energization, of
the distribution function are derived, as well as an approximate closed form
solution. Numerical simulations using the VPIC kinetic code are applied to
verify the model's analytical predictions. The results of the model for
realistic solar wind scenario are computed, where thermal streaming of
particles are important for generating a phase shift between the magnetic
perturbations and the pressure anisotropy. In turn, averaged over a pump cycle,
the phase shift permits mechanical work to be converted directly to heat in the
plasma. The results of this scenario show that magnetic pumping may account for
a significant portion of the solar wind energization.

Phenotypic fluctuations, which describe temporal variation of the phenotype of
an individual or individual-to-individual variation across a population, are
present in populations from microbes to higher animals. Phenotypic fluctuations
can provide a basis for adaptation and be the target of selection. Here we
present a theoretical and experimental investigation of the fate of phenotypic
fluctuations in directed evolution experiments where phenotypes are subject to
constraints. We show that selecting bacterial populations for fast migration
through a porous environment drives a reduction in cell-to-cell variation
across the population. Using sequencing and genetic engineering we study the
genetic basis for this reduction in phenotypic fluctuations. We study the
generality of this reduction by developing a simple, abstracted, numerical
simulation model of the evolution of phenotypic fluctuations subject to
constraints. Using this model we find that strong and weak selection generally
lead respectively to increasing or decreasing cell-to-cell variation as a
result of a bound on the selected phenotype under a wide range of parameters.
However, other behaviors are also possible, and we describe the outcome of
selection simulations for different model parameters and suggest future
experiments. We analyze the mechanism of the observed reduction of phenotypic
fluctuations in our experimental system, discuss the relevance of our abstract
model to the experiment and explore its broader implications for evolution.

sparse motifs in massive graphs whose edges are observed in a stream. Our
technique requires only a single pass on the data and uses a memory of fixed
size $M$, which can be magnitudes smaller than the number of edges.
  Our methods addresses the challenging task of counting sparse motifs -
sub-graph patterns that have low probability to appear in a sample of $M$ edges
in the graph, which is the maximum amount of data available to the algorithms
in each step. To obtain an unbiased and low variance estimate of the count we
partition the available memory to tiers (layers) of reservoir samples. While
the base layer is a standard reservoir sample of edges, other layers are
reservoir samples of sub-structures of the desired motif. By storing more
frequent sub-structures of the motif, we increase the probability of detecting
an occurrence of the sparse motif we are counting, thus decreasing the variance
and error of the estimate.
  We demonstrate the advantage of our method in the specific applications of
counting sparse 4 and 5-cliques in massive graphs. We present a complete
analytical analysis and extensive experimental results using both synthetic and
real-world data. Our results demonstrate the advantage of our method in
obtaining high-quality approximations for the number of 4 and 5-cliques for
large graphs using a very limited amount of memory, significantly outperforming
the single edge sample approach for counting sparse motifs in large scale

quantum search of a marked node on a complete graph of $n$ nodes in the

show that, given fixed and finite levels of disorder and thermal fluctuations,
there is an optimal range of bath temperatures that can significantly improve
the success probability of the algorithm. Remarkably for a fixed disorder
strength $\sigma$, the system relaxation time decreases for higher temperatures
within a robust range of parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that for
strong disorder, the presence of a thermal bath increases the success
probability from $1/(n \sigma^2)$ to at least $1/2$. While the asymptotic
running time is approximately maintained, the need to repeat the algorithm many
times and issues associated with unitary over-rotations can be avoided as the
system relaxes to an absorbing steady state. Furthermore, we discuss for what
regimes of disorder and bath parameters quantum speedup is possible and mention
conditions for which similar phenomena can be observed in more general families
of graphs. Our work highlights that in the presence of static disorder, even
non-engineered environmental interactions can be beneficial for a quantum

learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain.
Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this

include decreasing sparsity and noise in the extracted features and increasing
the performance of prediction.
  Methods: In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical
Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This
framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new
imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multiclass prediction. APA can
automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli.
Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced
classification.
  Results and Conclusions: Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words,

approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

variational data assimilation technique. Within a given assimilation window,
the assimilation procedure minimizes the differences between data and the
forecast from the model, by finding an optimal meridional circulation in the
convection zone, and an optimal initial magnetic field, via a quasi-Newton
algorithm. We demonstrate the capability of the technique to estimate the
meridional flow by a closed-loop experiment involving 40 years of synthetic,
solar-like data. By assimilating the synthetic magnetic proxies annually, we
are able to reconstruct a (stochastic) time-varying meridional circulation

robust in estimating a flow whose level of fluctuation can reach 30% about the
average, and that the horizon of predictive capability of the method is of the

depth $\sim1$ for the dominant emission lines of \ion{O}{7} and \ion{O}{8},

we treat optical depth effects with a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer model,
which leads to slightly steeper density profiles ($\beta \approx 0.5$) than if
optical depths effects were ignored. For the preferred model where the halo is
rotating on cylinders at $180$ km s$^{-1}$, independent fits to both lines lead
to identical results, where the core radius is $2.5$ kpc and the turbulent
component of the Doppler b parameter is $100-120$ km s$^{-1}$; the turbulent
pressure is $20\%$ of the thermal pressure. The fit is improved when emission
from a disk is included, with a radial scale length of $3$ kpc (assumed) and a
fitted vertical scale height of approximately $1.3$ kpc. The disk component is
a minor mass constituent and has low optical depth, except at low latitudes.

The membrane discretization is based on curvilinear surface elements that can

Navier-Stokes equations, and its discretization is based on stabilized
Petrov-Galerkin FE. The coupling between fluid and structure uses a conforming

the mesh motion around the structure. The formulation is very general and
admits diverse applications that include contact at free surfaces. This is
demonstrated by two analytical and three numerical examples exhibiting strong

unusually large horizontal flow amplitude with distinctly different directions.
While meridional flow in AR 12192 was poleward that supports the flux transport
to poles, it was equatorward in AR 10486. Furthermore, there was a sudden
increase in the magnitude of estimated zonal flow in shallow layers in AR 12192
during the X3.1 flare, however, it reversed direction in AR 10486 with X17.2
flare. These flow patterns produced strong twists in horizontal velocity with
depth in AR 10486 that persisted throughout the disk passage as opposed to AR
12192, which produced a twist only after the eruption of the X3.1 flare that
disappeared soon after. Our study indicates that the sunspot rotation combined
with the re-organization of magnetic field in AR 10486 was not sufficient to
decrease the flow energy even after several large flares that might have
triggered CMEs. Furthermore, in the absence of sunspot rotation in AR 12192,

adapt the pre-trained face CNN to specific videos using discovered training

several groups have reported hints for a yet unidentified line in astrophysical
X-ray signals at an energy of 3.5\,keV. While it is not unlikely that this line
is simply a reflection of imperfectly modeled atomic transitions, it has
renewed the community's interest in models of keV-scale dark matter, whose
decay would lead to such a line. The alternative possibility of dark matter
annihilation into monochromatic photons is far less explored, a lapse that we
strive to amend in this paper. More precisely, we introduce a novel model of
fermionic dark matter $\chi$ with $\mathcal{O}(\text{keV})$ mass, annihilating
to a scalar state $\phi$ which in turn decays to photons, for instance via
loops of heavy vector-like quarks. The resulting photon spectrum is box-shaped,
but if $\chi$ and $\phi$ are nearly degenerate in mass, it can also resemble a
narrow line. We discuss dark matter production via two different mechanisms --
misalignment and freeze-in -- which both turn out to be viable in vast regions
of parameter space. We constrain the model using astrophysical X-ray data, and
we demonstrate that, thanks to the velocity-dependence of the annihilation
cross section, it has the potential to reconcile the various observations of
the 3.5\,keV line. We finally address the $\phi$-mediated force between dark
matter particles and its possible impact on structure formation.

are able to reconstruct the solar opacity profile in a data driven fashion,
independently of any reference opacity tables, obtaining a 4% uncertainty at
the base of the convective envelope and 0.8% at the solar core. When systematic
uncertainties are included, results are 7.5% and 2% respectively. In addition
we find that the values of most of the other inputs of the standard solar

present a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the

in the light of current data and of expected experimental sensitivities, the
prospects for the detection of a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilations
in the Sun. To be as general as possible, equilibrium between the capture and

capture in the Sun is dominated by spin-independent interactions, current
direct detection bounds already preclude the observation of a neutrino signal

complementarity is observed, over most of the parameter space, between future

bipolar TI-SC-TI junction, where the electrochemical potentials in the outer
leads differ in their overall sign. As a result, we find that nonlocal singlet
pairing across the junction is completely suppressed for any excitation energy.
Hence, this junction acts as a perfect spin triplet filter across the SC
generating equal-spin Cooper pairs via crossed Andreev reflection.

  matter connectivity with diffusion MRI",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  White matter structures composed of myelinated axons in the living human
brain are primarily studied by diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). These long-range
projections are typically characterized in a two-step process: dMRI is used to
estimate the orientation of axons within each voxel, then these local
orientations are linked together to estimate the spatial extent of putative
white matter bundles. Tractography, the process of tracing bundles across
voxels, either requires computationally expensive (probabilistic) simulations
to model uncertainty in fiber orientation or ignores it completely
(deterministic). Probabilistic simulation necessarily generates a finite number
of trajectories, introducing ""simulation error"" to trajectory estimates. Here
we introduce a method to analytically (via a closed-form solution) take an
orientation distribution function (ODF) from each voxel and calculate the
probabilities that a trajectory projects from a voxel into each directly
adjacent voxel. We validate our method by demonstrating that probabilistic
simulations converge to our analytically computed probabilities at the voxel
level as the number of simulated seeds increases. We show that our method
accurately calculates the ground-truth transition probabilities from a phantom
dataset. As a demonstration, we incoroporate our analytic method for voxel
transition probabilities into the Voxel Graph framework, creating a
quantitative framework for assessing white matter structure that we call
""analytic tractography"". The long-range connectivity problem is reduced to
finding paths in a graph whose adjacency structure reflects voxel-to-voxel
analytic transition probabilities. We demonstrate this approach performs
comparably to many current probabilistic and deterministic approaches at a
fraction of the computational cost. Open source software software is provided.

employed together with reddening-insensitive emission line diagnostics to
constrain a dynamical model for the broad-line region (BLR) in NGC 3998. The
BLR is modelled as a large H$^+$ region ${\sim}$ 7 pc in radius consisting of
dust-free, low density ${\sim}$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, low metallicity ${\sim}$ 0.01

significantly discriminates between two independent measures of the black hole
mass, favouring the estimate of de Francesco et al. (2006). Interpreting the

simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with highest weight $\lambda$ can be computed
via the use of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula. This formula is an
alternating sum over the Weyl group and involves the computation of a partition
function. In this paper we consider a $q$-analog of Kostant's weight
multiplicity and present a SageMath program to compute $q$-multiplicities for
the simple Lie algebras.

and 1667-MHz circumstellar OH maser emission from asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars and red supergiants (RSGs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using the
Parkes and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes. No clear OH
maser emission has been detected in any of our observations targeting luminous,
long-period, large-amplitude variable stars, which have been confirmed
spectroscopically and photometrically to be mid- to late-M spectral type. These
observations have probed 3 - 4 times deeper than any OH maser survey in the
SMC. Using a bootstrapping method with LMC and Galactic OH/IR star samples and
our SMC observation upper limits, we have calculated the likelihood of not
detecting maser emission in any of the two sources considered to be the top
maser candidates to be less than 0.05%, assuming a similar pumping mechanism as
the LMC and Galactic OH/IR sources. We have performed a population comparison
of the Magellanic Clouds and used Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry to confirm
that we have observed all high luminosity SMC sources that are expected to
exhibit maser emission. We suspect that, compared to the OH/IR stars in the
Galaxy and LMC, the reduction in metallicity may curtail the dusty wind phase
at the end of the evolution of the most massive cool stars. We also suspect
that the conditions in the circumstellar envelope change beyond a simple
scaling of abundances and wind speed with metallicity.

2015 to January 19, 2016, during which gravitational waves were directly
detected from two binary black hole systems, namely GW150914 and GW151226.
Confident detection of gravitational waves requires an understanding of
instrumental transients and artifacts that can reduce the sensitivity of a
search. Studies of the quality of the detector data yield insights into the
cause of instrumental artifacts and data quality vetoes specific to a search
are produced to mitigate the effects of problematic data. In this paper, the
systematic removal of noisy data from analysis time is shown to improve the
sensitivity of searches for compact binary coalescences. The output of the
PyCBC pipeline, which is a python-based code package used to search for
gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences, is used as a
metric for improvement. GW150914 was a loud enough signal that removing noisy
data did not improve its significance. However, the removal of data with excess
noise decreased the false alarm rate of GW151226 by more than two orders of
magnitude, from 1 in 770 years to less than 1 in 186000 years.

safely attain the maximum traffic flow on roadways under dynamic traffic
patterns, such as those engendered by the merger of two strings of vehicles due
a lane drop. Strings of vehicles have to be shaped correctly in terms of the
inter-vehicular time-gap and velocity to ensure that such operation is
feasible. However, controllers that can achieve such traffic shaping over the
multiple dimensions of target time-gap and velocity over a region of space are
unknown. The objective of this work is to design such a controller, and to show
that we can design candidate time-gap and velocity profiles such that it can
stabilize the string of vehicles in attaining the target profiles. Our analysis
is based on studying the system in the spacial rather than the time domain,
which enables us to study stability as in terms of minimizing errors from the
target profile and across vehicles as a function of location. Finally, we
conduct numeral simulations in the context of shaping two platoons for merger,
which we use to illustrate how to select time-gap and velocity profiles for
maximizing flow and maintaining safety.

freedom (DOF) used to describe a system of interest. CG can be thought of as a
projection on coarse-grained DOF and is therefore dependent on the functions
used to represent the CG force field. In this work, we show that naive
extensions of the coarse-grained force-field can result in unphysical
parametrizations of the CG potential energy surface (PES). This issue can be
elevated by coarse-graining the two- and three-body forces separately, which
also helps to evaluate the importance of many-body interactions for a given

the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) at longer wavelengths. SPICA, with
its 2.5-m telescope actively-cooled to below 8K, will obtain the first
spectroscopic determination, in the mid-IR rest-frame, of both the
star-formation rate and black hole accretion rate histories of galaxies,
reaching lookback times of 12 Gyr, for large statistically significant samples.
Densities, temperatures, radiation fields and gas-phase metallicities will be
measured in dust-obscured galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), sampling a
large range in mass and luminosity, from faint local dwarf galaxies to luminous
quasars in the distant Universe. AGN and starburst feedback and feeding
mechanisms in distant galaxies will be uncovered through detailed measurements
of molecular and atomic line profiles. SPICA's large-area deep
spectrophotometric surveys will provide mid-IR spectra and continuum fluxes for
unbiased samples of tens of thousands of galaxies, out to redshifts of z~6.
Furthermore, SPICA spectroscopy will uncover the most luminous galaxies in the
first few hundred million years of the Universe, through their characteristic
dust and molecular hydrogen features.

interactions or mergers. We examine the dependence of the physical parameters
of the host galaxies on the properties of the AGNs, namely radio-loudness and
the width of the broad emission lines. In accordance with previous studies,
narrow-line (H$\beta$ FWHM $\leq 2000$ km~s$^{-1}$) type 1 AGNs, in contrast to
their broad-line (H$\beta$ FWHM $> 2000$ km~s$^{-1}$) counterparts, are
preferentially hosted in later type, lower luminosity galaxies, which have a
higher incidence of pseudo-bulges, are more frequently barred, and are less
morphologically disturbed. This suggests narrow-line type 1 AGNs experienced a
more quiescent evolutionary history driven primarily by internal secular
evolution instead of external dynamical perturbations. The fraction of AGN
hosts showing merger signatures is larger for more luminous sources. Radio-loud
AGNs generally preferentially live in earlier type (bulge-dominated), more
massive hosts, although a minority of them appears to contain a significant

mainly encompassing the connectivity between visual, attentional, DMN and

However, the growth of primary mirror diameters, necessary for these detection,
comes with an increase of their complexity (segmentation, secondary mirror
features). These discontinuities in the aperture can greatly limit the
performance of coronagraphic instruments. In this context, we introduced a new
technique, Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities - Optimized Stroke

In particular, we analyze the influence of the deformable setup (size and

optimizing the performance of the instrument in contrast and throughput while
minimizing the strokes applied to the deformable mirrors. These results will

low-energy theory contains both the vacuum massless excitations and the string
zero-modes. The question we address in this work is whether the vacuum and the
string moduli decouple at low energies, allowing a description of the
low-energy dynamics in terms of a two-dimensional theory on the string
worldsheet. We find a simple condition controlling the bulk-string coupling: If
there exist two flavors such that the product of their U(1) charge difference
with the magnetic flux carried by the string configuration is not an integer
multiple of 2\pi, the string has zero-modes that decay slower than 1/r, where r
is the radial distance from the string core. These modes are coupled to the
vacuum massless excitations even at low energies. If, however, all such
products are integer multiples of 2\pi, long-range modes of this type do not
exist and the string moduli decouple from the bulk at low energies. This
condition turns out to coincide with the condition of trivial Aharonov-Bohm
phases for the particles in the spectrum. In addition to a derivation of the
bulk-string decoupling criterion using classical analysis of the string
zero-modes, we provide a non-perturbative derivation of the criterion, which

domains depends crucially on generalization from limited training experience.
Function approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalize in order to
estimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods have
achieved generalization about the agent's uncertainty regarding unvisited
states. We present a new method for computing a generalized state visit-count,
which allows the agent to estimate the uncertainty associated with any state.
  In contrast to existing exploration techniques, our
$\phi$-$\textit{pseudocount}$ achieves generalization by exploiting the feature
representation of the state space that is used for value function
approximation. States that have less frequently observed features are deemed
more uncertain. The resulting $\phi$-$\textit{Exploration-Bonus}$ algorithm
rewards the agent for exploring in feature space rather than in the original
state space. This method is simpler and less computationally expensive than
some previous proposals, and achieves near state-of-the-art results on
high-dimensional RL benchmarks. In particular, we report world-class results on
several notoriously difficult Atari 2600 video games, including Montezuma's
Revenge.

remaining undetected implying a limit on the star formation rate in the host

formation rates up to hundreds of solar masses per year. Two other quasars have
particularly interesting properties. VIMOS2911 is one of the least luminous z>6
quasars known with M_1450=-23.1, yet its host galaxy is experiencing a very
powerful starburst. PSO J167-13 has a broad and luminous [CII] line and a
neighbouring galaxy a projected distance of 5kpc away that is also detected in
the [CII] line and continuum. Combining with similar observations from the
literature, we study the ratio of [CII] line to far-infrared luminosity finding
this ratio increases at high-redshift at a fixed far-infrared luminosity,
likely due to lower dust content, lower metallicity and/or higher gas masses.
We compile a sample of 21 high-redshift quasars with dynamical masses and
investigate the relationship between black hole mass and dynamical mass. The
new observations presented here reveal dynamical masses consistent with the
relationship defined by local galaxies. However, the full sample shows a very
wide scatter across the black hole mass - dynamical mass plane, whereas both
the local relationship and simulations of high-redshift quasars show a much
lower dispersion in dynamical mass.

health. There are papers showing an association between the consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages and Type 2 diabetes. Many meta-analyses use
individual studies that do not adjust for multiple testing or multiple modeling
and thus provide biased estimates of effect. Hence the claims reported in a
meta-analysis paper may be unreliable if the primary papers do not ensure
unbiased estimates of effect. Objective: Determine the statistical reliability
of 10 papers and indirectly the reliability of the meta-analysis study. Method:
Ten primary papers used in a meta-analysis paper and counted the numbers of
outcomes, predictors, and covariates. We estimated the size of the potential
analysis search space available to the authors of these papers; i.e. the number
of comparisons and models available. Since we noticed that there were
differences between predictors and covariates cited in the abstract and in the
text, we applied this formula to information found in the abstracts, Space A,
as well as the text, Space T, of each primary paper. Results: The median and
range of the number of comparisons possible across the primary papers are 6.5
and (2-12,288) for abstracts, and 196,608 and (3,072-117,117,952) the texts.
Note that the median of 6.5 for Space A is misleading as each primary study has
60-165 foods not mentioned in the abstract. Conclusion: Given that testing is
at the 0.05 level and the number of comparisons is very large, nominal
statistical significance is very weak support for a claim. The claims in these
papers are not statistically supported and hence are unreliable. Thus, the
claims of the meta-analysis paper lack evidentiary confirmation.

give birth to a single particle independently (at a possibly time-dependent

process at time $T>0$. It is known that the tree spanned by the $N$ tips alive
at time $T$ of the tree thus obtained (called reduced tree or coalescent tree)
is a coalescent point process (CPP), which basically means that the depths of
interior nodes are iid. Now select each of the $N$ tips independently with
probability $y$ (Bernoulli sample). It is known that the tree generated by the
selected tips, which we will call Bernoulli sampled CPP, is again a CPP. Now
instead, select exactly $k$ tips uniformly at random among the $N$ tips

of Bernoulli sampled CPPs with the same parent CPP, over some explicit

propose level-specific random effect distributions and numerical integration
techniques to improve usability, relaxing the normally distributed random
effects assumption to allow multivariate $t$-distributed random effects. We
consider some special cases of the general framework, describing some new

We parse this data from GTFS, the prevailing standard for public transit data.
LOOM proceeds in three stages: (1) construct a so-called line graph, where
edges correspond to segments of the network with the same set of lines
following the same course; (2) construct an ILP that yields a line ordering for
each edge which minimizes the total number of line crossings and line
separations; (3) based on the line graph and the ILP solution, draw the map. As
a naive ILP formulation is too demanding, we derive a new custom-tailored
formulation which requires significantly fewer constraints. Furthermore, we
present engineering techniques which use structural properties of the line
graph to further reduce the ILP size. For the subway network of New York, we
can reduce the number of constraints from 229,000 in the naive ILP formulation
to about 4,500 with our techniques, enabling solution times of less than a
second. Since our maps respect the geography of the transit network, they can
be used for tiles and overlays in typical map services. Previous research work

forces on the statistics of air temperature and velocity increments are
experimentally investigated at the cross over from production to inertial range

destruction) of turbulent kinetic energy can be used to form a dimensionless
stability parameter $\zeta$ that classifies the state of the atmosphere as
common in many atmospheric surface layer studies. Here, we assess how $\zeta$
affects the scale-wise evolution of the probability of extreme air temperature
excursions, their asymmetry and time reversibility. The analysis makes use of
high frequency velocity and air temperature time series measurements collected
at $z$=5 m above a grass surface at very large Reynolds numbers $Re=u_* z/\nu >
1\times 10^5$ ($u_*$ is the friction velocity and $\nu$ is the kinematic
viscosity of air). Using conventional higher-order structure functions,
temperature exhibits larger intermittency and wider multifractality when
compared to the longitudinal velocity component, consistent with laboratory
studies and simulations conducted at lower $Re$. Moreover, deviations from the
classical Kolmogorov scaling for the longitudinal velocity are shown to be
reasonably described by the She-Leveque vortex filament model that has no
'tunable' parameters and is independent of $\zeta$. The work demonstrates that
external boundary conditions, and in particular the magnitude and sign of the
sensible heat flux, have a significant impact on temperature
advection-diffusion dynamics within the inertial range. In particular,
atmospheric stability affects both the buildup of intermittency and the
persistent asymmetry and time irreversibility observed in the first two decades

galaxies and three pairs of galaxies. We include in our study 28 archival
observations, bringing our sample size to 103 bright single-dish submillimetre

differential number counts of our sample, finding them to overlap with previous
single-dish survey number counts within the uncertainties, although our
cumulative number count is systematically lower than the parent SCUBA-2

estimate the probability that a ${\gtrsim}\,10\,$mJy single-dish submillimetre

a significant change in the number counts, to be about 15 per cent. Assuming
the remaining 85 per cent of the targets are ultra-luminous starburst galaxies

simulations of reaction-diffusion systems based on the Doi or volume reactivity
model, in which pairs of particles react with a specified Poisson rate if they
are closer than a chosen reactive distance. In our Doi model, we ensure that
the microscopic reaction rules for various association and disassociation
reactions are consistent with detailed balance (time reversibility) at
thermodynamic equilibrium. The SRBD algorithm uses Strang splitting in time to
separate reaction and diffusion, and solves both the diffusion-only and
reaction-only subproblems exactly, even at high packing densities. To
efficiently process reactions without uncontrolled approximations, SRBD employs
an event-driven algorithm that processes reactions in a time-ordered sequence
over the duration of the time step. A grid of cells with size larger than all
of the reactive distances is used to schedule and process the reactions, but
unlike traditional grid-based methods such as Reaction-Diffusion Master
Equation (RDME) algorithms, the results of SRBD are statistically independent
of the size of the grid used to accelerate the processing of reactions. We use
the SRBD algorithm to compute the effective macroscopic reaction rate for both
reaction- and diffusion-limited irreversible association in three dimensions.
We also study long-time tails in the time correlation functions for reversible
association at thermodynamic equilibrium. Finally, we compare different
particle and continuum methods on a model exhibiting a Turing-like instability
and pattern formation. We find that for models in which particles diffuse off
lattice, such as the Doi model, reactions lead to a spurious enhancement of the
effective diffusion coefficients.

eccentric binaries can occur for typical protostellar disc parameters in less
than a typical disc lifetime for binaries with orbital periods of order 100
years or less. Resonant torques are much less effective at truncating the inner
parts of circumbinary polar discs than the inner parts of coplanar discs. For
polar discs, they vanish for a binary eccentricity of unity. The results agree
with the simulations in showing that discs can evolve to a polar state.
Circumbinary planets may then form in such discs and reside on polar orbits.

identifying community structure at different scales based on multiresolution
modularity and consensus clustering. Our contribution consists of two parts.
First, we propose a strategy for sampling the entire range of possible
resolutions for the multiresolution modularity quality function. Our approach
is directly based on the properties of modularity and, in particular, provides
a natural way of avoiding the need to increase the resolution parameter by
several orders of magnitude to break a few remaining small communities,
necessitating the introduction of ad-hoc limits to the resolution range with
standard sampling approaches. Second, we propose a hierarchical consensus
clustering procedure, based on a modified modularity, that allows one to
construct a hierarchical consensus structure given a set of input partitions.
While here we are interested in its application to partitions sampled using
multiresolution modularity, this consensus clustering procedure can be applied
to the output of any clustering algorithm. As such, we see many potential
applications of the individual parts of our multiresolution consensus
clustering procedure in addition to using the procedure itself to identify
hierarchical structure in networks.

is investigated in this paper. In such a network, a sink node desires to
compute with zero error a {\em target function}, of which the inputs are
generated at multiple source nodes. The edges in the network are assumed to be
error-free and have limited capacity. The nodes in the network are assumed to
have unbounded computing capability and be able to perform network coding. The
{\em computing rate} of a network code that can compute the target function
over the network is the average number of times that the target function is
computed with zero error for one use of the network. In this paper, we obtain
an improved upper bound on the computing capacity, which is applicable to
arbitrary target functions and arbitrary network topologies. This improved
upper bound not only is an enhancement of the previous upper bounds but also is
the first tight upper bound on the computing capacity for computing an
arithmetic sum over a certain non-tree network, which has been widely studied
in the literature. We also introduce a multi-dimensional array approach that
facilitates evaluation of the improved upper bound. Furthermore, we apply this
bound to the problem of computing a vector-linear function over a network. With
this bound, we are able to not only enhance a previous result on computing a
vector-linear function over a network but also simplify the proof
significantly. Finally, we prove that for computing the binary maximum function
over the reverse butterfly network, our improved upper bound is not achievable.
This result establishes that in general our improved upper bound is non
achievable, but whether it is asymptotically achievable or not remains open.

often contains tracks of multiple agents (e.g., multiple players in a sports

Extensive numerical simulations and statistical analyses of the

which includes the equilibrium localized turbulence, the temporally persistent
turbulence and the uniform turbulence, is identified. The spread of turbulent
band is mainly caused by an oblique extension at moderate Reynolds numbers and
band splitting at high Reynolds numbers. The small scale regime of a turbulent

player retention and rise revenues. Churn prediction models allow to understand
player loyalty and to anticipate when they will stop playing a game. Thanks to
these predictions, several initiatives can be taken to retain those players who
are more likely to churn.
  Survival analysis focuses on predicting the time of occurrence of a certain
event, churn in our case. Classical methods, like regressions, could be applied
only when all players have left the game. The challenge arises for datasets
with incomplete churning information for all players, as most of them still
connect to the game. This is called a censored data problem and is in the
nature of churn. Censoring is commonly dealt with survival analysis techniques,
but due to the inflexibility of the survival statistical algorithms, the
accuracy achieved is often poor. In contrast, novel ensemble learning
techniques, increasingly popular in a variety of scientific fields, provide
high-class prediction results.
  In this work, we develop, for the first time in the social games domain, a
survival ensemble model which provides a comprehensive analysis together with
an accurate prediction of churn. For each player, we predict the probability of
churning as function of time, which permits to distinguish various levels of
loyalty profiles. Additionally, we assess the risk factors that explain the

relevant for the evaluation of game events and game-business diagnosis. Our
experiments provide intuitive visualizations to validate the results of the
clustering and to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, we
assess the common characteristics of the players belonging to the same group.

in the functional linear model using smoothing splines. We propose a
generalized likelihood ratio test based on an easily implementable data-driven
estimate. The quality of the test is measured by the minimal distance between
the null and the alternative set that still allows a possible test. The lower
bound of the minimax decay rate of this distance is derived, and test with a
distance that decays faster than the lower bound would be impossible. We show
that the minimax optimal rate is jointly determined by the smoothing spline
kernel and the covariance kernel. It is shown that our test attains this
optimal rate. Simulations are carried out to confirm the finite-sample
performance of our test as well as to illustrate the theoretical results.
Finally, we apply our test to study the effect of the trajectories of oxides of
nitrogen ($\text{NO}_{\text{x}}$) on the level of ozone ($\text{O}_3$).

result is an efficient algorithm for simulating quantum error correction

algorithm has runtime $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. It
allows us to simulate systems with more than one thousand qubits and obtain the
first error threshold estimates for several toy models of coherent noise.
Numerical results are reported for storage of logical states subject to
$Z$-rotation errors and for logical state preparation with general $SU(2)$

probabilistic generative model which exploits textual features and limited POS

astrophysical variance from the neutron stars themselves and the interstellar

the contribution from receiver noise are countered by the strong chromatic
dependence of interstellar effects and intrinsic pulse-profile evolution. The
resulting optimal frequency range is therefore telescope and pulsar dependent.
We demonstrate the results for five pulsars included in current pulsar timing
arrays and determine that they are not optimally observed at current center
frequencies. For those objects, we find that better choices of total bandwidth
as well as center frequency can improve the arrival-time precision. Wideband
receivers centered at somewhat higher frequencies with respect to the currently
adopted receivers can reduce required overall integration times and provide
significant improvements in arrival time uncertainty by a factor of ~sqrt(2) in
most cases, assuming a fixed integration time. We also discuss how timing
programs can be extended to pulsars with larger dispersion measures through the
use of higher-frequency observations.

This system is comprised of an energy transmitter (ET) and an energy harvesting
user (EHU), both operating in a FD mode. The ET transmits energy towards the
EHU. The EHU harvests this energy and uses it to transmit information back to
the ET. As a result of the FD mode, both nodes are affected by
self-interference. The self-interference has a different effect at the two
nodes: it impairs the decoding of the received signal at the ET, however, it
provides an additional source of energy for the EHU. This paper derives the
capacity of this communication system assuming a processing cost at the EHU and
additive white Gaussian noise channel with block fading. Thereby, we show that
the capacity achieving scheme is relatively simple and therefore applicable to
devices with limited resources. Moreover, our numerical results show
significant improvements in terms of data rate when the capacity achieving
strategy is employed compared to half-duplex transmission. Moreover, we show
the positive and negative effects of the self-interference at the EHU and the

superconductivity and the nematic state, where the lattice rotational symmetry

unclear. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we
investigate how the band structure and the superconducting gap evolve in
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, as the sulfur substitution suppresses nematicity that
eventually diminishes at the nematic end point (NEP) at $x=0.17$. Anisotropic
quasiparticle-interference patterns, which represent the nematic band
structure, gradually become isotropic with increasing $x$ without detectable
anomalies in the band parameters at the NEP. By contrast, the superconducting
gap, which is almost intact in the nematic phase, suddenly shrinks as soon as
$x$ exceeds the NEP. Our observation implies that the presence or absence of
nematicity results in two distinct pairing states, whereas the pairing
interaction is insensitive to the strength of nematicity. This provides a clue
for understanding the pairing mechanism.

Kitani","Efficient K-Shot Learning with Regularized Deep Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature representations from pre-trained deep neural networks have been known
to exhibit excellent generalization and utility across a variety of related
tasks. Fine-tuning is by far the simplest and most widely used approach that
seeks to exploit and adapt these feature representations to novel tasks with
limited data. Despite the effectiveness of fine-tuning, itis often sub-optimal
and requires very careful optimization to prevent severe over-fitting to small
datasets. The problem of sub-optimality and over-fitting, is due in part to the
large number of parameters used in a typical deep convolutional neural network.
To address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective regularization
method for fine-tuning pre-trained deep networks for the task of k-shot
learning. To prevent overfitting, our key strategy is to cluster the model
parameters while ensuring intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster diversity
of the parameters, effectively regularizing the dimensionality of the parameter
search space. In particular, we identify groups of neurons within each layer of
a deep network that shares similar activation patterns. When the network is to
be fine-tuned for a classification task using only k examples, we propagate a
single gradient to all of the neuron parameters that belong to the same group.
The grouping of neurons is non-trivial as neuron activations depend on the
distribution of the input data. To efficiently search for optimal groupings
conditioned on the input data, we propose a reinforcement learning search
strategy using recurrent networks to learn the optimal group assignments for
each network layer. Experimental results show that our method can be easily
applied to several popular convolutional neural networks and improve upon other
state-of-the-art fine-tuning based k-shot learning strategies by more than10%

three-dimensional non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics simulation. Since rapid cloud
collapse is suppressed until the magnetic flux is sufficiently removed from the
initially magnetically subcritical cloud by ambipolar diffusion, it takes >
5-10t_ff to form a protostar, where t_ff is the freefall timescale of the
initial cloud. The angular momentum of the star forming cloud is efficiently
transferred to the interstellar medium before the rapid collapse begins, and
the collapsing cloud has a very low angular momentum. Unlike the magnetically
supercritical case, no large-scale low-velocity outflow appears in such a
collapsing cloud due to the short lifetime of the first core. Following
protostar formation, a very weak high-velocity jet, which has a small momentum
and might disappear at a later time, is driven near the protostar, while the
circumstellar disc does not grow during the early mass accretion phase. The
results show that the star formation process in magnetically subcritical clouds

produced by machine learning sounds better, but still lacks hierarchical
temporal structure. We restore temporal hierarchy by augmenting machine
learning with a temporal production grammar, which generates the music's
overall structure and chord progressions. A compatible melody is then generated
by a conditional variational recurrent autoencoder. The autoencoder is trained
with eight-measure segments from a corpus of 10,000 MIDI files, each of which
has had its melody track and chord progressions identified heuristically. The
autoencoder maps melody into a multi-dimensional feature space, conditioned by
the underlying chord progression. A melody is then generated by feeding a
random sample from that space to the autoencoder's decoder, along with the

non-repeating FRBs may be produced at the time of a merger of binary neutron
stars (BNS), provided that the BNS merger rate is close to the high end of the
currently possible range. However, the merger environment is polluted by
dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine
this by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that
the ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star

can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be
explained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may
leave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the

the ray-based finite element method (ray-FEM), whose original version can not
handle the singularity close to point sources accurately. This pitfall is
addressed by combining the ray-FEM, which is used to compute the smooth
far-field of the solution accurately, with a high-order asymptotic expansion
close to the point source, which is used to properly capture the singularity of
the solution in the near-field. The method requires a fixed number of grid
points per wavelength to accurately represent the wave field with an asymptotic
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\omega^{-1/2})$, where $\omega$ is the
frequency parameter in the Helmholtz equation. In addition, a fast
sweeping-type preconditioner is used to solve the resulting linear system.
  We present numerical examples in 2D to show both accuracy and efficiency of
our method as the frequency increases. In particular, we provide numerical
evidence of the convergence rate, and we show empirically that the overall
complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\omega^2)$ up to a poly-logarithmic factor.

variety of fluctuation theorems in classical and quantum regimes were found in

system is unitary under a time-dependent total Hamiltonian and to define the
heat and work as the changes in energy by applying two energy measurements
scheme to the composite system. The other strategy is to unravel these MQMEs
into random quantum jump trajectories (QJTs) and to define the stochastic heat
and work along the individual trajectories. Many important physical concepts,
mathematical techniques, and fluctuation theorems at different descriptive
levels are given in as detailed a manner as possible. We also use concrete

entropy $S_p$ and the proton temperature $T_p$ compared to a velocity-dependent

consider several versions of this problem, corresponding to different semantics
of RPQs that have recently been considered: arbitrary paths, shortest paths,
simple paths, and trails. Whereas arbitrary and shortest paths can be
enumerated in polynomial delay, the situation is much more intricate for simple
paths and trails. For instance, already the question if a given graph contains
a simple path or trail of a certain length has cases with highly non-trivial
solutions and cases that are long-standing open problems. In this setting, we
study RPQ evaluation from a parameterized complexity perspective. We define a
class of simple transitive expressions that is prominent in practice and for
which we can prove two dichotomy-like results: one for simple paths and one for
trails paths. We observe that, even though simple path semantics and trail
semantics are intractable for RPQs in general, they are feasible for the vast
majority of the kinds of RPQs that users use in practice. At the heart of this
study is a result of independent interest on the parameterized complexity of
finding disjoint paths in graphs: the two disjoint paths problem is W[1]-hard

nodes has received comparatively little attention. The leading protocol for
low-power IPv6 routing, RPL, is no exception, as it is often studied in
multipoint-to-point scenarios. As a result, downward routing (from root to
node) is still notoriously difficult, holding back the emergence of Internet of
Things applications that involve actuation. In this paper, we focus on
achieving industrial-grade reliability levels (1e-5 failure rate) in downward
routing with RPL. We make every packet count, and classify the different causes
of packet loss. We show how to mitigate each source of packet loss, by (1)
introducing a gradient metric that favors reliable links, (2) increasing
neighborhood awareness for accurate link selection, and (3) ensuring a robust
routing state maintenance and packet forwarding. We demonstrate RPL downward
routing with loss rates in the order of 1e-5 in four different testbeds up to
352 nodes, in both sparse and dense settings. We also validate our solution on
top of a low-power TSCH scheduler, and achieve sub-percent low duty cycles and
a channel utilization of 0.07% at every node, spread over 16 channels.

is a striking prediction of various classes of new physics models. Should one
of these states be discovered during the 13 TeV runs of the LHC or at future
high energy hadron colliders, understanding its properties will be crucial in
order to shed light on the underlying model structure. Depending on the
extra-quarks quantum number under SU(2)L, their coupling to Standard Model
quarks and bosons have either a dominant left- or right-handed chiral
component. By exploiting the polarisation properties of the top quarks arising
from the decay of pair-produced extra quarks, we show how it is possible to
discriminate among the two hypothesis in the whole discovery range currently
accessible at the LHC, thus effectively narrowing down the possible
interpretations of a discovered state in terms of new physics scenarios.
Moreover, we estimate the discovery and discrimination power of future
prototype hadron colliders with centre of mass energies of 33 and 100 TeV.

In terms of value, they gave conditions for a desirable reduction. We show that
a probability distribution for a desirable reduction relies on optimal
strategies in the original game. Also, we correct an improper example given by
them to show that the reverse of a theorem does not hold.

potential sources of continuous gravitational waves for ground-based

parameters obtained from electromagnetic observations, can be carried out.
Matched filtering maximizes the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, but a large
sensitivity loss is expected in case of even a very small mismatch between the
assumed and the true signal parameters. For this reason, {\it narrow-band}
analyses methods have been developed, allowing a fully coherent search for
gravitational waves from known pulsars over a fraction of a hertz and several
spin-down values. In this paper we describe a narrow-band search of eleven
pulsars using data from Advanced LIGO's first observing run. Although we have
found several initial outliers, further studies show no significant evidence
for the presence of a gravitational wave signal. Finally, we have placed upper
limits on the signal strain amplitude lower than the spin-down limit for 5 of
the 11 targets over the bands searched: in the case of J1813-1749 the spin-down
limit has been beaten for the first time. For an additional 3 targets, the
median upper limit across the search bands is below the spin-down limit. This
is the most sensitive narrow-band search for continuous gravitational waves
carried out so far.

features of commutative ring spectra and discuss model category structures. As
a first interesting class of examples of such ring spectra we focus on
(commutative) algebra spectra over commutative Eilenberg-MacLane ring spectra.
We present two constructions that yield commutative ring spectra: Thom spectra
associated to infinite loop maps and Segal's construction starting with
bipermutative categories. We define topological Hochschild homology, some of
its variants, and topological Andre-Quillen homology. Obstruction theory for
commutative structures on ring spectra is described in two versions. The notion
of etale extensions in the spectral world is tricky and we explain why. We
define Picard groups and Brauer groups of commutative ring spectra and present
examples.

registers to store and compare data from an infinite domain. We study the
concept of synchronizing data words in RAs: does there exist a data word that
sends all states of the RA to a single state?
  For deterministic RAs with k registers (k-DRAs), we prove that inputting data
words with 2k+1 distinct data from the infinite data domain is sufficient to
synchronize. We show that the synchronization problem for DRAs is in general
PSPACE-complete, and it is NLOGSPACE-complete for 1-DRAs. For nondeterministic
RAs (NRAs), we show that Ackermann(n) distinct data (where n is the size of the
RA) might be necessary to synchronize. The synchronization problem for NRAs is
in general undecidable, however, we establish Ackermann-completeness of the
problem for 1-NRAs.
  Another main result is the NEXPTIME-completeness of the length-bounded
synchronization problem for NRAs, where a bound on the length of the
synchronizing data word, written in binary, is given. A variant of this last
construction allows to prove that the length-bounded universality problem for
NRAs is co-NEXPTIME-complete.

measurements. We find that the fluctuations $\delta B_{\perp}^2$ are not
gyrotropic at a given frequency $f$, a property already observed at larger
scales ($\parallel$/$\perp$ mean parallel/perpendicular to the average magnetic
${\bf B_0}$). This non-gyrotropy gives indications on the angular distribution
of the wave vectors ${\bf k}$: at $f <$ 10Hz, we find that $k_{\perp}\gg
k_{\parallel}$, mainly in the fast wind; at $f >$ 10Hz, fluctuations with a
non-negligible $k_{\parallel}$ are also present. We then consider the
anisotropy ratio $\delta B_{\parallel}^2/\delta B_{\perp}^2$, which is a
measure of the magnetic compressibility of the fluctuations. This ratio, always
smaller than 1, increases with $f.$ It reaches a value showing that the
fluctuations are more or less isotropic at electron scales, for $f \geq 50$Hz.
From 1 to 15-20Hz, there is a strong correlation between the observed
compressibility and the one expected for the kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAW),
which only depends on the total plasma $\beta$. For $f > $ 15-20Hz, the
observed compressibility is larger than expected for KAW; and it is stronger in
the slow wind: this could be an indication of the presence of a slow-ion
acoustic mode of fluctuations, which is more compressive and is favored by the
larger values of the electron to proton temperature ratio generally observed in
the slow wind.

genetic sequences emerged and are maintained through evolution. On the one
hand, non-random structures at different scales indicate a complex genome
organisation. On the other hand, single-strand symmetry has been scrutinised
using neutral models in which correlations are not considered or irrelevant,
contrary to empirical evidence. Different studies investigated these two
statistical features separately, reaching minimal consensus despite sustained
efforts. Here we unravel previously unknown symmetries in genetic sequences,
which are organized hierarchically through scales in which non-random
structures are known to be present. These observations are confirmed through
the statistical analysis of the human genome and explained through a simple
domain model. These results suggest that domain models which account for the
cumulative action of mobile elements can explain simultaneously non-random
structures and symmetries in genetic sequences.

affected by dust obscuration. Due to the lack of sensitivity of past and
current infrared (IR) instrumentation, so far it has not been possible to get a
glimpse into the early phases of the dust-obscured Universe. Among the next
generation of IR observatories, SPICA, observing in the 12-350 micron range,
will be the only facility that can enable us to make the required leap forward
in understanding the obscured star-formation rate and black-hole accretion rate
densities (SFRD and BHARD, respectively) with respect to what Spitzer and
Herschel achieved in the mid- and far-IR at z<3. In particular, SPICA will have
the unique ability to trace the evolution of the obscured SFRD and BHARD over

(i.e., 3<z<6-7), where its predecessors had severe limitations. Here we discuss
the potential of both deep and shallow photometric surveys performed with the

obscuration in a band centred at 34 micron. These unique unbiased photometric
surveys that SPICA will perform will be followed up by observations both with

within and between the electron and phonon subsystems of the material. Due to
electron-electron and phonon-phonon collisions, both subsystems relax into
respective new thermodynamic equilibria within a characteristic thermalization
time, which is different for each one of them. Moreover, they equilibrate their
temperatures by electron phonon coupling. The relaxation of the electronic
nonequilibrium and its effect on the electron phonon coupling was subject to a
number of studies and it is comparably well understood, while the
nonequilibrium within the phononic subsystem is usually neglected and its
influence of the nonequilibrium phonons on other relaxation processes is
unclear. Our calculations show significant differences in the energy transfer
rate between the electrons and the phonons depending whether a nonequilibrium
distribution is assumed for the phonons or not. Here, we present a model to
study the relaxation of the nonequilibrium phonon subsystem. Collisions between
phonons are described within the frame of Boltzmann integrals. From this, an
energy-dependent relaxation time can be extracted and inserted into a
relaxation-time approach. Within the frame of this model, we study the
thermalization of a phonon distribution induced by ultrafast laser irradiation.
We show, that the thermalization time of such a distribution is of the order of
some hundreds of picoseconds. Moreover, we discuss the energy transfer between
Fermi-distributed electrons and nonequilibrium phonons and compare this to the
energy transfer for equilibrium distributions in both subsystems.

such as energy levels, radiative rates and electron impact excitation rates, or
equivalently the effective collision strengths. Such data are desired for a
wide range of elements and their many ions, although all elements are not
useful for all types of plasmas. Since measurements of atomic data are mostly
confined to only a few energy levels of some ions, calculations for all
parameters are highly important. However, often there are large discrepancies
among different calculations for almost all parameters, which makes it
difficult to apply the data with confidence. Many such discrepancies (and the
possible remedies) were discussed earlier (Fusion Sci. Tech. 2013, 63, 363).
Since then a lot more anomalies for almost all of these atomic parameters have
come to notice. Therefore, this paper is a revisit of various atomic parameters
to highlight the large discrepancies, their possible sources and some
suggestions to avoid those, so that comparatively more accurate and reliable
atomic data may be available in the future.

the lines of sight toward the 3C sources we apply color cuts: removed sources
satisfy either the IRAC1/2 cut $[3.6] - [4.5] < -0.3$ or the Pan-STARRS/IRAC
cut $i - [4.5] < 0.5$ if detected by Pan-STARRS. For both selection methods,
about half of the 3C radio sources show significant overdensities ($>3\sigma$)
within 30"" ($\sim$250 kpc) projected distance from the radio source compared to
the surrounding galaxy densities measured in the $50''-120''$ annulus. The
Pan-STARRS/IRAC cut reveals higher average overdensities than the IRAC1/2 cut
and also a decline of overdensities at $z>1.4$. To infer the nature of the
cluster members, we rerun the analysis using a stronger IRAC1/2 cut $[3.6] -
[4.5] < -0.1$ which removes $1<z<1.4$ passive ellipticals but not star-forming

difference profoundly affects the possible applicability of fluctuation
theorems like the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem. The Heisenberg ferromagnet ,
well below its Curie temperature, is a system with long-ranged correlations in

shown to be sensitive to airway caliber changes to such an extent that it might
be considered as a marker of them. It is thus important to understand how these
changes and their localization mechanically affect the total NO flux
penetrating the airway lumen (JawNO), hence FENO, independently from any
inflammatory status change. A new model was used which simulates NO production,
consumption and diffusion inside the airway epithelium wall, then, NO excretion
through the epithelial wall into the airway lumen and, finally, its axial
transport by diffusion and convection in the airway lumen. This model may also
consider the presence of a mucus layer coating the epithelial wall. Simulations
were performed that showed the great sensitivity of JawNO to peripheral airways
caliber changes. Moreover, FENO showed distinct behaviors depending on the
location of the caliber change. Considering a bronchodilation, absence of FENO
change was associated with dilation of central airways, FENO increase with
dilation up to pre-acinar small airways, and FENO decrease with intra-acinar
dilation due to amplification of the back-diffusion flux. The presence of a
mucus layer was also shown to play a significant role in FENO changes.
Altogether, the present work provides theoretical evidences that specific FENO
changes in acute situations are linked to specifically located airway caliber
changes in the lung periphery. This opens the way for a new role for FENO as a
functional marker of peripheral airway caliber change.

strongly modifies the magnetic properties of strongly electron correlated hole
doped cuprate superconductors. The reason for enhanced uniform magnetic
susceptibility, \c{hi}, in Zn substituted cuprates is debatable. So far, the
observed magnetic behavior has been analyzed mainly in terms of two somewhat
contrasting scenarios, (a) that due to independent localized moments appearing
in the vicinity of Zn arising because of the strong electronic/magnetic
correlations present in the host compound and (b) that due to transfer of
quasiparticle spectral weight and creation of weakly localized low energy
electronic states associated with each Zn atom in place of an in-plane Cu. If
the second scenario is correct, one should expect a direct correspondence
between Zn induced suppression of superconducting transition temperature, Tc,
and the extent of the enhanced magnetic susceptibility at low temperature. In
this case, the low-T enhancement of \c{hi} would be due to weakly localized
quasiparticle states at low energy and these electronic states will be
precluded from taking part in Cooper pairing. We explore this second
possibility by analyzing the \c{hi}(T) data for La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4 with
different hole contents, p (= x), and Zn concentrations (y) in this paper.

monolayer WS$_2$ coated with an overlayer of Fe. Our ab initio calculations
reveal that the system is a half-metallic ferromagnet with a gap of $\sim 1$ eV
for the majority spin channel. Furthermore, the combined effect of
time-reversal symmetry breaking due to the magnetic Fe overlayer and the large
spin-orbit coupling induced by W gives rise to non-degenerate K and K$'$
valleys. This has a tremendous impact on the excited state properties induced
by externally applied circularly polarized light. Our analysis demonstrates
that the latter induces a singular hot spot structure of the transition
probability around the K and K$'$ valleys for right and left circular
polarization, respectively. We trace back the emergence of this remarkable
effect to the strong momentum dependent spin-noncollinearity of the valence
band involved. As a main consequence, a strong valley-selective magnetic
circular dichroism is obtained, making this system a prime candidate for
spintronics and photonics applications.

first-order gradients to a parameter server. This implies that the magnitude of
a worker delta is smaller compared to an accumulated gradient, and provides a
better direction towards a minimum compared to first-order gradients, which in
turn also forces possible implicit momentum fluctuations to be more aligned
since we make the assumption that all workers contribute towards a single
minima. As a result, our approach mitigates the parameter staleness problem
more effectively since staleness in asynchrony induces (implicit) momentum, and
achieves a better convergence rate compared to other optimizers such as
asynchronous EASGD and DynSGD, which we show empirically.

a measure is distributed in small balls. Finding conditions that guarantee the
measure to be effectively spread out in different directions is a classical
question going back to Besicovitch (1938) and Marstrand (1954). Classically,
conical density theorems deal with the distribution of the Hausdorff measure.
  The process of taking blow-ups of a measure around a point induces a natural
dynamical system called the scenery flow. Relying on this dynamics makes it
possible to apply ergodic-theoretical methods to understand the statistical
behavior of tangent measures. This approach was initiated by Furstenberg (1970,
2008) and greatly developed by Hochman (2010). The scenery flow is a
well-suited tool to address problems concerning conical densities.
  In this survey, we demonstrate how to develop the ergodic-theoretical
machinery around the scenery flow and use it to study conical density theorems.

the cosmological principle of homogeneity and isotropy on large scales.
However, small scale inhomogeneities can alter observational and dynamical
relations, affecting the inferred cosmological parameters. For precision
constraints on the properties of dark energy, it is important to assess the
potential systematic effects arising from these inhomogeneities. In this study,
we use the Type Ia supernova magnitude-redshift relation to constrain the
inhomogeneities as described by the Dyer-Roeder distance relation and the
effect they have on the dark energy equation of state ($w$), together with
priors derived from the most recent results of the measurements of the power
spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.
We find that the parameter describing the inhomogeneities ($\eta$) is
correlated with $w$. The best fit values $w = -0.933 \pm 0.065$ and $\eta =
0.61 \pm 0.37$ are consistent with homogeneity at $< 2 \sigma$ level. Assuming
homogeneity ($\eta =1$), we find $w = -0.961 \pm 0.055$, indicating only a
small change in $w$. For a time-dependent dark energy equation of state, $w_0 =
-0.951 \pm 0.112$ and $w_a = 0.059 \pm 0.418$, to be compared with $w_0 =
-0.983 \pm 0.127$ and $w_a = 0.07 \pm 0.432$ in the homogeneous case, which is
also a very small change. Current data are not sufficient to constrain the
fraction of dark matter (DM) in compact objects, $f_p$ at the 95$\%$ C.L.,

recover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and
concave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and
static correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but
now demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree
Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the
shape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane, and we find this
shape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the
jmDFT approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-
order, functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT errors. We select
one such physically intuitive form and incorporate it self-consistently to
correct semi-local DFT. We demonstrate on model systems that this jmDFT

(SINR) requirements of all the users in the massive MIMO networks are
guaranteed even in the presence of pilot contamination. However, this design
has some vulnerabilities, such as one known pilot sequence and the correlation
among the pilot sequences, that may be exploited by active attackers. In this
work, we first identify the potential vulnerabilities in the user
load-achieving pilot sequence design and then, accordingly, develop an active
attacking strategy on the network. In the proposed attacking strategy, the
active attackers transmit known pilot sequences in the uplink training and
artificial noise in the downlink data transmission. Our examination
demonstrates that the per-cell user load region is significantly reduced by the
proposed attacking strategy. As a result of the reduced per-cell user load
region, the SINR requirements of all the users are no longer guaranteed in the
presence of the active attackers. Specifically, for the worst affected users
the SINR requirements may not be ensured even with infinite antennas at the

  2017-1","math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a family of dense initializations for limited-memory quasi-Newton
methods. The proposed initialization exploits an eigendecomposition-based
separation of the full space into two complementary subspaces, assigning a
different initialization parameter to each subspace. This family of dense
initializations is proposed in the context of a limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) trust-region method that makes use of
a shape-changing norm to define each subproblem. As with L-BFGS methods that
traditionally use diagonal initialization, the dense initialization and the
sequence of generated quasi-Newton matrices are never explicitly formed.
Numerical experiments on the CUTEst test set suggest that this initialization
together with the shape-changing trust-region method outperforms other L-BFGS
methods for solving general nonconvex unconstrained optimization problems.
While this dense initialization is proposed in the context of a special
trust-region method, it has broad applications for more general quasi-Newton
trust-region and line search methods. In fact, this initialization is suitable
for use with any quasi-Newton update that admits a compact representation and,
in particular, any member of the Broyden class of updates.

manipulate metallic superconductors via field-effect. Here we report
field-effect control of the supercurrent in $all$-metallic transistors made of
different Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting thin films. At low

accounts for our observations, and points towards the interpretation in terms
of an electric-field-induced perturbation propagating inside the

well-motivated framework, centers around the predicted existence of four light,
nearly mass-degenerate Higgsinos with mass $\sim 100-200$ GeV (not too far
above $m_Z$). The small mass splittings amongst the higgsinos, typically 4-20
GeV, results in very little visible energy arising from decays of the heavier
higgsinos. Given that other SUSY particles are considerably heavy, this makes
detection challenging at hadron colliders. On the other hand, the clean
environment of an electron-positron collider with $\sqrt{s}>2m_{higgsino}$
would enable a decisive search of these required higgsinos, and thus either the
discovery or exclusion of natural SUSY. We present a detailed simulation study
of precision measurements of higgsino masses and production cross sections at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV of the proposed International Linear Collider currently
under consideration for construction in Japan. The study is based on a Geant4
simulation of the International Large Detector concept. We examine several
benchmark points just beyond the HL-LHC reach, with four light higgsinos
directly accessible by the ILC, and the mass differences between the lightest
SUSY particle and the heavier states ranging from about 4 to 20 GeV. It can be
shown that their masses and production cross sections can be precisely measured
to approximately 1\% precision or better. These precise measurements allow for
extracting the underlying weak scale SUSY parameters, giving predictions for
the masses of heavier SUSY states. These provide motivation for future
high-energy colliders. Additionally, dark matter properties may be derived.
Evolution of the measured gaugino masses to high energies should allow testing
the hypothesis of gaugino mass unification.

$S(\rho||\sigma) := {\rm Tr}[\rho(\log \rho - \log \sigma)]$ is non-increasing

${\mathcal M}$ be a finite dimensional von Neumann algebra and ${\mathcal N}$ a

deduced from this. A theorem of Petz says that there is equality if and only if
$\sigma = {\mathcal R}_\rho(\sigma_{\mathcal N} )$, where ${\mathcal R}_\rho$
is the Petz recovery map, which is dual to the Accardi-Cecchini coarse graining

well-formed Ni@CNT or Co@CNT samples are reported for the first time. This is
achieved by sublimation of nickelocene (or cobaltocene) in combination with
'camphor'. These samples exhibit some of the highest saturation magnetization

provides insights for obtaining narrow length and diameter distribution and
reduced residue particles outside filled CNT - factors which are important for

horizon as the infra-red cut-off. The interaction rate between dark energy and
dark matter has been reconstructed with three different choices of the
interaction term. It is shown that the coupling parameter of the interaction
term should evolve with redshift to allow the successful transition from
decelerated to accelerated phase of expansion. Constraints on the model
parameters are obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using the
supernova distance modulus data and observational measurements of the Hubble
parameter. Results show that the model with the coupling parameter increasing
with redshift (z) or equivalently decreasing with the evolution, are ruled out.
On the other hand, coupling parameters, increasing or slowly varying with the
evolution, are consistent with the observed evolution scenario. A Bayesian
evidence calculation has been carried out for statistical selection of the
reconstructed models. Though the kinematical parameters are well behaved for
these models, the physical variables which determine the nature of the
components in the matter sector, are not at all realistic. We have concluded
that the existence of spatial curvature is essential for this particular type
of dark energy models.

information to generate robust grasps for a robotic hand. First, the
topological information of the object model is incorporated by building the
mean curvature skeleton and segmenting the object accordingly in order to
identify object regions which are suitable for applying a grasp. Second, the
local surface structure is investigated to construct feasible and robust
grasping poses by aligning the hand according to the local object shape. We
show how this information can be used to derive different grasping strategies,
which also allows to distinguish between precision and power grasps. We applied
the approach to a wide variety of object models of the KIT and the YCB
real-world object model databases and evaluated the approach with several
robotic hands. The results show that the skeleton-based grasp planner is
capable to autonomously generate high-quality grasps in an efficient manner. In
addition, we evaluate how robust the planned grasps are against hand
positioning errors as they occur in real-world applications due to perception

generated grasps are of high quality since they can be successfully applied
even when the hand is not exactly positioned.

this paper the next simplest case: a characteristic initial value problem of
this coupled system with the initial data given on two intersecting null cones,
the incoming one of which is assumed to be spherically symmetric and singular
at its vertex, and the outgoing one of which has no symmetries. It is shown
that, arbitrarily fixing the initial scalar field, the set of the initial
conformal metrics on the outgoing null cone such that the maximal future
development does not have any sequences of closed trapped surfaces approaching
the singularity, is of first category in the whole space in which the shear
tensors are continuous. Such a set can then be viewed as exceptional, although
the exceptionality is weaker than the at least $1$ co-dimensionality in
spherical symmetry. Almost equivalently, it is also proved that, arbitrarily
fixing an incoming null cone $\underline{C}_\varepsilon$ to the future of the
initial incoming null cone, the set of the initial conformal metrics such that
the maximal future development has at least one closed trapped surface before
$\underline{C}_\varepsilon$, contains an open and dense subset of the whole

is naked if the initial shear is set to be zero, we may say that the spherical
naked singularities of a self-gravitating scalar field are not stable under
gravitational perturbations. This in particular gives new families of
non-spherically symmetric gravitational perturbations different from the

Polynomial Maps which are topologically conjugate to any polynomial map of the

temperature peaks (hot spots) which play a key role at the early stages of
ignition. Thus we perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations of shock induced
gas-cavity collapse in nitromethane. Ignition is the result of a complex
interplay between fluid dynamics and exothermic chemical reaction. To
understand the relative contribution between these two processes we consider in
this first part of the work the evolution of the physical system in the absence
of chemical reactions. We employ a multi-phase mathematical formulation which
accounts for the large density difference across the gas-liquid interface
without generating spurious temperature peaks. The mathematical and physical
models are validated against experimental, analytic and numerical data.
Previous studies identified the impact of the upwind side of the cavity wall to
the downwind one as the main reason for the generation of a hot-spot outside of
the cavity; this is also observed in this work. However, it is apparent that
the topology of the temperature field is more complex than previously thought
and additional hot spots locations exist, arising from the generation of Mach
stems rather than jet impact. To explain the generation mechanisms and topology
of the hot spots we follow the complex wave patterns generated and identify the
temperature elevation or reduction generated by each wave. This allows to track
each hot spot back to its origins. We show that the highest hot spot
temperatures can be more than twice the post-incident shock temperature of the
neat material and can thus lead to ignition. By comparing the maximum
temperature observed in the domain in 2D and 3D simulations we show that 3D
calculations are necessary to avoid belated ignition times in reactive
scenarios.

magnetic properties of the structures have been studied by vibrating sample
magnetometry (VSM), miscrostrip ferromagnetic resonance (MS-FMR) and Brillouin
light scattering (BLS) in the Damon-Eshbach geometry. VSM characterizations
show that films are mostly in-plane magnetized and the perpendicular saturating
field increases with decreasing CFA thickness suggesting the existence of
interface anisotropy. The presence of magnetic dead layers of 0.44 nm has been
detected by VSM. The MS-FMR with perpendicular applied magnetic field has been
used to determine the gyromagnetic factor. The BLS measurements reveal a
pronounced nonreciprocal spin waves propagation, due to the interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induced by Ir interface with CFA, which
increases with decreasing CFA thickness. The DMI sign has been found to be the
same (negative) as that of Pt/Co, in contrast to the ab-initio calculation on
Ir/Co. The thickness dependence of the effective DMI constant shows the
existence of two regimes similarly to that of the perpendicular anisotropy
constant. The DMI constant Ds was estimated to be -0.37 pJ/m for the thickest
samples where a linear thickness dependence of the effective DMI constant has
been observed.

shows that SLOPE yields optimal portfolios with good out-of-sample risk and
return performance properties, by reducing the overall turnover through more
stable asset weight estimates. Moreover, using the automatic grouping property
of SLOPE, new portfolio strategies, such as SLOPE-MV, can be developed to
exploit the data-driven detected similarities across assets.

planet-hosting Sun-like star which displays the shortest coronal activity cycle
known to date ($P_{\rm cyc}\sim$ 1.6 yr). With an age of $\sim$$625$ Myr,
$\iota$ Hor is also the youngest star with a detected activity cycle. The study
of its magnetic properties holds the potential to provide fundamental
information to understand the origin of cyclic activity and stellar magnetism
in late-type stars. In this series of articles, we present the results of a
comprehensive project aimed at studying the evolving magnetic field in this
star and how this evolution influences its circumstellar environment. This
paper summarizes the first stage of this investigation, with results from a
long-term observing campaign of $\iota$ Hor using ground-based high-resolution
spectropolarimetry. The analysis includes precise measurements of the magnetic
activity and radial velocity of the star, and their multiple time-scales of
variability. In combination with values reported in the literature, we show
that the long-term chromospheric activity evolution of $\iota$ Hor follows a
beating pattern, caused by the superposition of two periodic signals of similar
amplitude at $P_{1} \simeq 1.97 \pm 0.02$ yr and $P_{2} \simeq 1.41 \pm 0.01$
yr. Additionally, using the most recent parameters for $\iota$ Hor b in
combination with our activity and radial velocity measurements, we find that
stellar activity dominates the radial velocity residuals, making the detection
of additional planets in this system challenging. Finally, we report here the
first measurements of the surface longitudinal magnetic field strength of
$\iota$ Hor, which displays varying amplitudes within $\pm4$ G and served to

Traditionally, broadband linear polarisation (BBLP) measurements have been
considered an important diagnostic tool for the study of the interstellar dust,
while comparatively less attention has been paid to spectropolarimetric
measurements. However, spectropolarimetry may offer stronger constraints than
BBLP, for example by revealing narrowband features, and by allowing us to
distinguish the contribution of dust from the contribution of interstellar gas.
Therefore, we have decided to carry out a Large Interstellar Polarisation
Survey (LIPS) using spectropolarimetric facilities in both hemispheres. Here we
present the results obtained in the Southern Hemisphere with the FORS2

range 380--950\,nm at a spectral resolving power of about 880. We have produced
a publicly available catalogue of 127 linear polarisation spectra of 101

wavelength gradient of the polarisation position angle for the interstellar
polarisation along 76 different lines of sight. In agreement with previous
literature, we found that the best-fit parameters of the Serkowski-curve are
not independent of each other. However, the relationships that we obtained are
not always consistent with what was found in previous studies.

estimation in quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRI) via regression

signal model to simulate many parameter-measurement pairs. Inspired by machine
learning, PERK then takes these parameter-measurement pairs as labeled training
points and learns from them a nonlinear regression function using kernel
functions and convex optimization. PERK admits a simple implementation as
per-voxel nonlinear lifting of MRI measurements followed by linear minimum
mean-squared error regression. We demonstrate PERK for $T_1,T_2$ estimation, a
well-studied application where it is simple to compare PERK estimates against
dictionary-based grid search estimates. Numerical simulations as well as
single-slice phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate that PERK and grid
search produce comparable $T_1,T_2$ estimates in white and gray matter, but
PERK is consistently at least $23\times$ faster. This acceleration factor will
increase by several orders of magnitude for full-volume QMRI estimation
problems involving more latent parameters per voxel.

  Incarceration Rates in the U.S","Presented at the Data For Good Exchange 2017",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the rate of incarceration in the United States continues to grow, a large
body of research has been primarily focused on understanding the determinants
and drivers of federal and state prison growth. However, local jail systems,
with 11 million admissions each year, have generated less research attention
even though they have a far broader impact on communities. Preliminary time
trend analysis conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) uncovered
disparities in county jail incarceration rates by geography. Contrary to
assumptions that incarceration is an urban phenomenon, Vera discovered that
during the past few decades, pretrial jail rates have declined in many urban
areas whereas rates have grown or remained flat in rural counties. In an effort
to uncover the factors contributing to continued jail growth in rural areas,
Vera joined forces with Two Sigma's Data Clinic, a volunteer-based program that
leverages employees' data science expertise. Using county jail data from 2000 -
2013 and county-specific demographic, political, socioeconomic, jail and prison
population variables, a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was
specified to account for correlations within counties over time. The results
revealed that county-level poverty, police expenditures, and spillover effects
from other county and state authorities are all significant predictors of local
jail rates. In addition, geographic investigation of model residuals revealed
clusters of counties where observed rates were much higher (and much lower)
than expected conditioned upon county variables.

growth. Data and data analysis has become an essential element of urban
planning as cities use data to plan land use and development. One great
challenge is to use the tools of data science to promote equity along with
growth. The city of Atlanta is an example site of large-scale urban renewal
that aims to engage in development without displacement. On the Westside of
downtown Atlanta, the construction of the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the
conversion of an underutilized rail-line into a multi-use trail may result in
increased property values. In response to community residents' concerns and a
commitment to development without displacement, the city and philanthropic
partners announced an Anti-Displacement Tax Fund to subsidize future property
tax increases of owner occupants for the next twenty years. To achieve greater
transparency, accountability, and impact, residents expressed a desire for a
tool that would help them determine eligibility and quantify this commitment.
In support of this goal, we use machine learning techniques to analyze
historical tax assessment and predict future tax assessments. We then apply
eligibility estimates to our predictions to estimate the total cost for the
first seven years of the program. These forecasts are also incorporated into an
interactive tool for community residents to determine their eligibility for the
fund and the expected increase in their home value over the next seven years.

particular by modifying the value of the mass-shell parameter in the model. We
then fit the generalized model to scattering data at large s and small t. The
fitting results are inconclusive, but suggest that a better fit might be
obtained by allowing the mass-shell to vary. The model fits the data equally
well (roughly) for a wide range of values of the mass-shell parameter, but the
other fitting parameters (the slope and intercept of the Regge trajectory, and
the coupling constant and dipole mass from the proton-proton-glueball coupling)
are then inconsistent with what we expect. On the other hand, using the
traditional method of Reggeization generates a weaker fit, but the other
parameters obtain more physically reasonable values. In analyzing the fitting
results, we also found that our model is more consistent with the sqrt(s) =
1800 GeV coming from the E710 experiment than that coming from the CDF
experiment, and that our model has the greatest discrepancy with the data in
the range 0.5 GeV^2 < |t| < 0.6 GeV^2, suggesting that the transition from soft
Pomeron to hard Pomeron may occur closer to t = -0.5 GeV^2 rather than t = -0.6

implementation for studying mass conserving phase transitions on deforming

nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that live on an evolving
two-dimensional manifold. For the phase transitions, the PDE is the
Cahn-Hilliard equation for curved surfaces, which can be derived from surface
mass balance in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. For the surface
deformation, the PDE is the (vector-valued) Kirchhoff-Love thin shell equation.
Both PDEs can be efficiently discretized using $C^1$-continuous interpolations
without derivative degrees-of-freedom (dofs). Structured NURBS and unstructured
spline spaces with pointwise $C^1$-continuity are utilized for these
interpolations. The resulting finite element formulation is discretized in time
by the generalized-$\alpha$ scheme with adaptive time-stepping, and it is fully
linearized within a monolithic Newton-Raphson approach. A curvilinear surface
parameterization is used throughout the formulation to admit general surface
shapes and deformations. The behavior of the coupled system is illustrated by
several numerical examples exhibiting phase transitions on deforming spheres,
tori and double-tori.

the energy density inhomogeneity power spectrum generated by quantum
fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation in the non-flat XCDM model.
Here dark energy is parameterized using a fluid with a negative equation of
state parameter but with the speed of fluid acoustic inhomogeneities set to the
speed of light. We use this simple parameterization of dynamical dark energy,
that is relatively straightforward to use in a computation, in a first attempt
to gain some insight into how dark energy dynamics and non-zero spatial
curvature jointly affect the CMB anisotropy data constraints. Unlike earlier
analyses of non-flat models, we use a physically consistent power spectrum for
energy density inhomogeneities. We find that the Planck 2015 data in
conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements are reasonably well
fit by a closed XCDM model in which spatial curvature contributes a percent of
the current cosmological energy density budget. In this model, the measured
Hubble constant and non-relativistic matter density parameter are in good
agreement with values determined using most other data. Depending on parameter
values, the closed XCDM model has reduced power, relative to the tilted,
spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM case, and appears to partially alleviate the low
multipole CMB temperature anisotropy deficit and can help partially reconcile
the CMB anisotropy and weak lensing $\sigma_8$ constraints, at the expense of
somewhat worsening the fit to higher multipole CMB temperature anisotropy data.
However, the closed XCDM inflation model does not seem to improve the agreement
much, if at all, compared to the closed $\Lambda$CDM inflation case, even
though it has one more free parameter. Our results are interesting but
tentative; a more thorough analysis is needed to properly gauge their
significance.

identify both the location and severity of damage using the dynamic response
information acquired. While in theory the vibration-based and impedance-based
methods may facilitate damage identification with the assistance of a credible
baseline finite element model since the changes of stationary wave responses
are used in these methods, the response information is generally limited and
the measurements may be heterogeneous, making an inverse analysis using
sensitivity matrix difficult. Aiming at fundamental advancement, in this
research we cast the damage identification problem into an optimization problem
where possible changes of finite element properties due to damage occurrence
are treated as unknowns. We employ the multiple damage location assurance
criterion (MDLAC), which characterizes the relation between measurements and
predictions (under sampled elemental property changes), as the vector-form
objective function. We then develop an enhanced, multi-objective version of the
DIRECT approach to solve the optimization problem. The underlying idea of the
multi-objective DIRECT approach is to branch and bound the unknown parametric
space to converge to a set of optimal solutions. A new sampling scheme is
established, which significantly increases the efficiency in minimizing the
error between measurements and predictions. The enhanced DIRECT algorithm is
particularly suitable to solving for unknowns that are sparse, as in practical
situations structural damage affect only a small number of finite elements. A
number of test cases using vibration response information are executed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.

Poynting flux is always positive through a spherical surface centred on the

that the mysterious Schott term, hitherto thought in literature to arise from

that can deal with the pairwise structure and inherent experimental variability

variables represent the underlying HI assay measurement of any given pair of

between the same pair of virus strains, the difference in the viral sequence
remains the same. Through accurately representing the structure of the H1N1
data, the model is able to select virus sites which are antigenic, while its
latent structure achieves the computational efficiency required to deal with
large virus sequence data, as typically available for the influenza virus. In
addition to the latent variable model, we also propose a new method, block
integrated Widely Applicable Information Criterion (biWAIC), for selecting

to large variations in the contact forces, especially with typical
high-impedance designs. This can potentially damage the surroundings and/or the
robot. Series elastic actuators (SEAs) are a popular way to reduce the output
impedance of a robotic arm to improve control authority over the force exerted
on the environment. However this increased control over forces with lower
impedance comes at the cost of lower positioning precision and bandwidth. This
article examines the use of an iteratively-learned feedforward command to
improve position tracking when using SEAs. Over each iteration, the output
responses of the system to the quantized inputs are used to estimate a
linearized local system models. These estimated models are obtained using a
complex-valued Gaussian Process Regression (cGPR) technique and then, used to
generate a new feedforward input command based on the previous iteration's
error. This article illustrates this iterative machine learning (IML) technique
for a two degree of freedom (2-DOF) robotic arm, and demonstrates successful
convergence of the IML approach to reduce the tracking error.

harmonics of the anion plane vibrations in the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3
spin-liquid insulator. Tuning the incoming light energy at the K edge of two
distinct N sites permits to excite different sets of phonon modes. Cyanide CN
stretching mode is selected at the edge of the ordered N sites which are more
strongly connected to the BEDT-TTF molecules, while positionally disordered N
sites show multi-mode excitation. Combining measurements with calculations on
an anion plane cluster permits to estimate the sitedependent electron-phonon
coupling of the modes related to nitrogen excitation.
