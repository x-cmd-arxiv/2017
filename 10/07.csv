  Statistic","Corrected typos in abstract",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studying the effects of groups of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as
in a gene, genetic pathway, or network, can provide novel insight into complex
diseases, above that which can be gleaned from studying SNPs individually.
Common challenges in set-based genetic association testing include weak effect
sizes, correlation between SNPs in a SNP-set, and scarcity of signals, with
single-SNP effects often ranging from extremely sparse to moderately sparse in
number. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Generalized Berk-Jones
(GBJ) test for the association between a SNP-set and outcome. The GBJ extends
the Berk-Jones (BJ) statistic by accounting for correlation among SNPs, and it
provides advantages over the Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC) test when
signals in a SNP-set are moderately sparse. We also provide an analytic p-value
calculation procedure for SNP-sets of any finite size. Using this p-value
calculation, we illustrate that the rejection region for GBJ can be described
as a compromise of those for BJ and GHC. We develop an omnibus statistic as
well, and we show that this omnibus test is robust to the degree of signal
sparsity. An additional advantage of our method is the ability to conduct
inference using individual SNP summary statistics from a genome-wide
association study. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the GBJ though
simulation studies and application to gene-level association analysis of breast
cancer risk.

Hilbert space dimension $d_S$ (the target), subject to an unknown Hamiltonian
evolution, back to its quantum state at a past time $t_0$. The target is out of
our control: this means that we ignore both its free Hamiltonian and how the
system interacts with other quantum systems we may use to influence it. Under
these conditions, we prove that there exist protocols within the framework of
non-relativistic quantum physics which reset the target system to its exact
quantum state at $t_0$. Each ""resetting protocol"" is successful with non-zero
probability for all possible free Hamiltonians and interaction unitaries, save
a subset of zero measure. When the target is a qubit and the interaction is
sampled from the Haar measure, the simplest resetting circuits have a
significant average probability of success and their implementation is within
reach of current quantum technologies. Finally, we find that, in case the
resetting protocol fails, it is possible to run a further protocol that, if
successful, undoes both the natural evolution of the target and the effects of
the failed protocol over the latter. By chaining in this fashion several such
protocols, one can substantially increase the overall probability of a
successful resetting.

Conversely, geo-located social media data are publicly and freely available,
but present challenges especially for full timeline inference due to their
sparse nature. We propose a stochastic framework, Intermediate Location
Computing (ILC) which uses prior knowledge about human mobility patterns to
predict every missing location from an individual's social media timeline. We
compare ILC with a state-of-the-art RNN baseline as well as methods that are
optimized for next-location prediction only. For three major cities, ILC
predicts the top 1 location for all missing locations in a timeline, at 1 and
2-hour resolution, with up to 77.2% accuracy (up to 6% better accuracy than all
compared methods). Specifically, ILC also outperforms the RNN in settings of
low data; both cases of very small number of users (under 50), as well as
settings with more users, but with sparser timelines. In general, the RNN model
needs a higher number of users to achieve the same performance as ILC. Overall,
this work illustrates the tradeoff between prior knowledge of heuristics and
more data, for an important societal problem of filling in entire timelines
using freely available, but sparse social media data.

complex plasma crystal using diffusion of coplanar dust lattice waves. In the
limit where the Hamiltonian interactions can be decoupled from the
non-Hamiltonian effects, we identify two distinct types of wave transport:
Anderson-type delocalization and long-distance excitation. We use a
recently-developed spectral approach to evaluate the contribution of the
Anderson problem and compare it to the results of the simulation. The benefit
of our approach to transport problems is twofold. First, we employ a highly
tunable macroscopic hexagonal crystal, which exhibits many-body interactions
and allows for the investigation of transport properties at the kinetic level.
Second, the analysis of the transport problem in 2D is provided using an
innovative spectral approach, which avoids the use of scaling and boundary
conditions. Thus, the combination of theoretical calculation with simulation
results allows for the study of important characteristics of this open system.
The major deviation between the predicted and observed wave dynamics is a
long-distance lattice excitation, which occurs even when the initial
perturbation does not spread from the center to the exterior of the crystal. In
the decoupled Hamiltonian regime, this effect can be contributed to the dust
lattice interaction with the plasma environment.

wavelength fluctuations of the matter density and gravitational field. It has
been argued that the set of secondary effects that affect the galaxy
distribution, relativistic in nature, will bring new, complementary
cosmological constraints. We study this claim in detail by focusing on a subset
of wide-area future surveys: Stage-4 cosmic microwave background experiments
and photometric redshift surveys. In particular, we look at the magnification
lensing contribution to galaxy clustering and general relativistic corrections
to all observables. We quantify the amount of information encoded in these
effects in terms of the tightening of the final cosmological constraints as
well as the potential bias in inferred parameters associated with neglecting
them. We do so for a wide range of cosmological parameters, covering neutrino
masses, standard dark-energy parametrizations and scalar-tensor gravity
theories. Our results show that, while the effect of lensing magnification to
number counts does not contain a significant amount of information when galaxy
clustering is combined with cosmic shear measurements, this contribution does
play a significant role in biasing estimates on a host of parameter families if
unaccounted for. Since the amplitude of the magnification term is controlled by
the slope of the source number counts with apparent magnitude, $s(z)$, we also
estimate the accuracy to which this quantity must be known to avoid systematic
parameter biases, finding that future surveys will need to determine $s(z)$ to
the $\sim$5-10\% level. On the contrary, large-scale general-relativistic
corrections are irrelevant both in terms of information content and parameter
bias for most cosmological parameters, but significant for the level of
primordial non-Gaussianity.

between animals gives rise to the overall flock structure and behavior we
observe? This question is often investigated using self-propelled particle
models where particles represent the individual animals. These models differ in
the social interactions used, individual particle properties, and various
technical assumptions. One particular technical assumption relates to whether
all particles update their headings and positions at exactly the same time
(synchronous update) or not (asynchronous update). Here we investigate the
causal effects of this assumption in a specific model and find that it has a
dramatic impact. In particular, polarized groups do not form when synchronous
update is used, but are always produced with asynchronous updates. We also show
that full asynchrony is not required for polarized groups to form and quantify
time to polarized group formation. Since many important models in the
literature have been implemented with synchronous update only, we speculate
that our understanding of these models, or rather the social interactions on
which they are based, may be incomplete. Perhaps a range of previously
unobserved dynamic phenomena will emerge if other potentially more realistic
update schemes are chosen.

theories. Infinitesimal fluctuations around a given gauge field can be split
into physical and gauge fluctuations. Starting from some reference field the
gauge-invariant fields are constructed by consecutively adding physical
fluctuations. An arbitrary gauge field can be mapped to an associated gauge
invariant field. An effective action that depends on gauge-invariant fields
becomes a gauge-invariant functional of arbitrary gauge fields by associating
to every gauge field the corresponding gauge-invariant field. The
gauge-invariant effective action can be obtained from an implicit functional

the gauge-invariant effective average action or flowing action, which involves
an infrared cutoff. It obeys a gauge-invariant functional flow equation. We

associated with a collectively low phonon group velocity ($2.05\times 10^3 $

motion in highly anharmonic modes mainly involves the motion of N atoms, and
the charge density difference reveals that the N atoms become polarized with
the merging of anharmonicity. Moreover, the fitting procedure of the

anharmonicity of TiNBr. Our work is the first study of the thermoelectric

analysis has been conducted for the samples stored after quenching for the
specified times t and a detailed experimental dependence of the YBa2Cu3O6+d
lattice parameters a, b, and c on both d and t has been obtained. The regime of
low-speed quenching results in a threefold increase in the aging effect
magnitude. Particular cases of the c(d; t) dependence are well described by a
second-order polynomial with applying different coefficients for different t.
The behavior c has been explained on the basis of a simple model of the Coulomb
interaction between the CuO2 and CuOd structural planes, in which the hole
charge transfer from CuOd to CuO2 takes place providing the standard level of
Tc in YBa2Cu3O6+d (this level is characterized by a maximum Tc of 93 K at d =

the c(d; t) experimental dependence as well as the data on the hole
localization in the pairs Cu-O obtained by XPS, the authors have made a
conclusion about the nature of observed aging effects. The latter are likely to
be related to the transition of the Cu 3d9L-1 electron configuration to Cu 3d8

are sufficiently low to justify the optically thin approximation, and it is
commonly used in the analysis of line emissions from plasma in the solar
corona. However, densities of solar flare loops are substantially higher,
compromising the optically thin approximation. This study begins with a
radiative transfer model that uses typical solar flare densities and geometries
to show that hot coronal emission lines are not generally optically thin.
Further, the model demonstrates that the observed line intensity should exhibit
center-to-limb variability (CTLV), with flares observed near the limb being
dimmer than those occurring near disk-center. The model predictions are
validated with an analysis of over 200 flares observed by EVE on SDO that uses
6 lines, with peak formation temperatures between 8.9 and 15.8 MK, to show limb
flares are systematically dimmer than disk-center flares. The data are then
used to show that the electron column density along the line-of-sight typically
increases by 1.76 x 1019 cm-2 for limb flares over the disk-center flare value.
It is shown that CTLV of hot coronal emissions reduces the amount of ionizing
radiation propagating into the solar system, and changes the relative

a signal of CP violation that would clarify its role in nature and in theory.
Contemporary motivations include the role that CP violation plays in explaining
the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry and the search for new physics.
Experiments on a variety of systems have become ever-more sensitive, but
provide only upper limits on EDMs, and theory at several scales is crucial to
interpret these limits. Nuclear theory provides connections from Standard-Model

existence of axions - also a candidate dark-matter particle. Theoretical

[Here q is a power of the characteristic p with p odd]. In this paper, we
exhibit equally simple families whose geometric monodromy groups are the
alternating groups Alt(2q). $. We also determine their arithmetic monodromy
groups. By Raynaud's solution of the Abhyankar Conjecture, any finite simple
group whose order is divisible by p will occur as the geometric monodromy group
of some local system on the affine line in characteristic p; the interest here
is that it occurs in our particularly simple local systems.
  In the earlier work of Katz, he used a theorem to Kubert to know that the
monodromy groups in question were finite, then work of Gross to determine which
finite groups they were. Here we do not have, at present, any direct way of
showing this finiteness. Rather, the situation is more complicated and more
interesting. Using some basic information about these local systems, a
fundamental dichotomy is proved:
  The geometric monodromy group is either Alt(2q) or it is the special
orthogonal group SO(2q-1). An elementary polynomial identity is used to show
that the third moment is 1. This rules out the SO(2q-1) case. This roundabout
method establishes the theorem. It would be interesting to find a ""direct""
proof that these local systems have integer (rather than rational) traces; this
integrality is in fact equivalent to their monodromy groups being finite, Even
if one had such a direct proof, it would still require serious group theory to

the case of a photon velocity larger than the maximum attainable velocity of
the standard fermions. Up to now, Earth-based bounds on this type of Lorentz
violation have been determined from observations of TeV gamma rays. Here, we
elaborate on a novel approach to test Lorentz invariance with greatly improved
sensitivity. This approach is based on investigating extensive air showers
which are induced by cosmic-ray particles in the Earth's atmosphere. We study
the impact of two Lorentz-violating decay processes on the longitudinal
development of air showers, notably the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum
$X_\text{max}$. Specifically, the two Lorentz-violating decay processes
considered are photon decay into an electron-positron pair and modified
neutral-pion decay into two photons. We use Monte Carlo simulations performed
with the CONEX code which was extended to include these two Lorentz-violating
decay processes at a magnitude allowed by the best previous Earth-based bound.
Compared to standard physics, these Lorentz-violating decay processes reduce
the average $X_\text{max}$ for showers with primary energies above
$10^{18}\;\text{eV}$ by an amount that is significantly larger than the average
resolution of current air shower experiments. Comparing the simulations of the
average $X_\text{max}$ to observations, new Earth-based bounds on this type of
Lorentz violation are obtained, which are better than the previous bounds by
more than three orders of magnitude. Prospects of further studies are also
discussed.

to model the system dynamics accurately -- a difficult task. The fundamental
problem remains that simulation and reality diverge--we do not know how to
accurately change a robot's state. Thus, recent research on improving inverse
dynamics models has been focused on making use of machine learning techniques.
Traditional learning techniques train on the actual realized accelerations,
instead of the policy's desired accelerations, which is an indirect data
source. Here we show how an additional training signal -- measured at the
desired accelerations -- can be derived from a feedback control signal. This
effectively creates a second data source for learning inverse dynamics models.
Furthermore, we show how both the traditional and this new data source, can be
used to train task-specific models of the inverse dynamics, when used
independently or combined. We analyze the use of both data sources in

(ii) our IR-bright DOGs sample has larger $L_{\rm IR}$ (AGN) than Sy2s.

beginning with the first metal-free stars. By employing a completely
feedback-limited star formation prescription, stars form at maximum efficiency
until the self-consistently calculated feedback processes halt formation. We
account for a number of feedback processes including a meta-galactic
Lyman-Werner background, supernovae, photoionization, and chemical feedback.
Halos are evolved combining mass accretion rates found through abundance
matching with our feedback-limited star formation prescription, allowing for a
variety of Population III (Pop III) initial mass functions (IMFs). We find
that, for a number of models, massive Pop III star formation can continue on
until at least $z \sim 20$ and potentially past $z \sim 6$ at rates of around
$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, assuming these stars
form in isolation. At this point Lyman-Werner feedback pushes the minimum halo
mass for star formation above the atomic cooling threshold, cutting off the
formation of massive Pop III stars. We find that, in most models, Pop II and
Pop III star formation co-exist over cosmological time-scales, with the total
star formation rate density and resulting radiation background strongly
dominated by the former before Pop III star formation finally ends. These halos
form at most $\sim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ of massive Pop III stars during this phase
and typically have absolute magnitudes in the range of $M_\text{AB} = -5 $ to $
-10$. We also briefly discuss how future observations from telescopes such as
JWST or WFIRST and 21-cm experiments may be able to constrain unknown
parameters in our model such as the IMF, star formation prescription, or the

ultraviolet and X-ray photons before reionization is complete. While UV photons
from PopIII stars can in principle shift the onset of radiative coupling of the
21-cm transition -- and potentially reionization -- to early times, we find
that the remnants of PopIII stars are likely to have a more discernible impact
on the 21-cm signal than PopIII stars themselves. The X-rays from such sources
preferentially heat the IGM at early times, which elongates the epoch of
reheating and results in a more gradual transition from an absorption signal to
emission. This gradual heating gives rise to broad, asymmetric wings in the
absorption signal, which stand in contrast to the relatively sharp, symmetric
signals that arise in models treating PopII sources only. A stronger signature
of PopIII, in which the position of the absorption minimum becomes inconsistent
with PopII-only models, requires extreme star-forming events that may not be
physically plausible, lending further credence to predictions of relatively
high frequency absorption troughs, $\nu_{\min} \sim 100$ MHz. As a result,
though the trough location alone may not be enough to indicate the presence of
PopIII, the asymmetric wings should arise even if only a few PopIII stars form
in each halo before the transition to PopII star formation occurs, provided
that the PopIII IMF is sufficiently top-heavy and at least some PopIII stars

narrow lanes, cast by localized density enhancements, and broader features
which possibly trace the larger scale dynamics of the inner disk. We acquired
visible and near-infrared photometry which shows variations up to 10% in the
$JHK$ bands, possibly correlated with the presence of the shadows. Analysis of

inner disk to $i = 18.2\deg^{+3.4}_{-4.1}$ and ${\rm PA} = 57.3\deg \pm
5.7\deg$, consistent with an alignment with the outer disk or a minor disk warp
of several degrees. The latter scenario could explain the broad,

it excites vertical oscillations, corrugating and flaring the Galactic stellar
disc. These responses can be understood by a two-phase picture in which the
interaction is first dominated by torques from the wake excited by Sgr in the
MW dark halo before transitioning to tides from Sgr's direct impact on the disc
at late times. We show for the first time that a massive Sgr model
simultaneously reproduces the locations and motions of arc-like over densities,
such as the Monoceros Ring and the Triangulum Andromeda stellar clouds, that
have been observed at the extremities of the disc, while also satisfying the
solar neighbourhood constraints on the vertical structure and streaming motions
of the disc. In additional simulations, we include the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) self consistently with Sgr. The LMC introduces coupling through
constructive and destructive interference, but no new corrugations. In our
models, the excitation of the current structure of the outer disk can be traced
to interactions as far back as 6-7 Gyr ago (corresponding to $z\leq1$). Given
the apparently quiescent accretion history of the MW over this timescale, this
places Sgr as the main culprit behind the vertical oscillations of the disc and
the last major accretion event for the Galaxy with the capacity to modulate its

a situation produced by secular interactions with its planetary or stellar

between the orbit and the planet's degree-2 fundamental-mode. Starting from
zero energy, the f-mode can diffusively grow to large amplitudes if its
one-kick energy gain > 10^-5 of the orbital energy. This requires a pericentre
distance of < 4 tidal radii (or 1.6 Roche radii). If the f-mode has a
non-negligible initial energy, diffusive evolution can occur at a lower
threshold. The first effect can stall the secular migration as the f-mode can
absorb orbital energy and decouple the planet from its secular perturbers,
parking all migrating jupiters safely outside the zone of tidal disruption. The
second effect leads to rapid orbit circularization as it allows an excited
f-mode to continuously absorb orbital energy as the orbit eccentricity
decreases. So without any explicit dissipation, other than the fact that the
f-mode will damp nonlinearly when its amplitude reaches unity, the planet can
be transported from a few AU to ~ 0.2 AU in ~ 10^4 yrs. Such a rapid
circularization is equivalent to a dissipation factor Q ~ 1, and it explains
the observed deficit of super-eccentric Jovian planets. Lastly, the repeated
f-mode breaking likely deposit energy and angular momentum in the outer
envelope, and avoid thermally ablating the planet.
  Overall, this work boosts the case for forming hot Jupiters through
high-eccentricity secular migration.

increased dramatically due to a zero-energy resonance at the WIMP-pair
threshold. For masses near these critical values, WIMP scattering processes are
accurately described by an effective field theory where WIMPs have
nonperturbative zero-range contact interactions. The effective field theory is
controlled by a renormalization-group fixed point at which the WIMPs are
degenerate in mass and their scattering length is infinite. If the WIMPs can
exchange massless mediators, the resulting long-range interaction must also be
treated nonperturbatively. We develop an effective field theory for
SU(2)-triplet dark matter, which have short-range weak and long-range

The long-range Coulomb interaction between charged winos is resummed to all

matching wino-wino scattering amplitudes calculated by solving the

scheduling policy for datacenter networks. Current datacenter networks
primarily inherit the principles that went into the design of Internet, where
congestion control and scheduling are distributed. While distributed
architecture provides robustness, it suffers in terms of performance. Unlike
Internet, data center is fundamentally a ""controlled"" environment. This raises
the possibility of designing a centralized architecture to achieve better
performance. Recent solutions such as Fastpass and Flowtune have provided the
proof of this concept. This raises the question: what is theoretically optimal
performance achievable in a data center?
  We propose a centralized policy that guarantees a per-flow end-to-end flow
delay bound of $O$(#hops $\times$ flow-size $/$ gap-to-capacity). Effectively
such an end-to-end delay will be experienced by flows even if we removed
congestion control and scheduling constraints as the resulting queueing
networks can be viewed as the classical reversible multi-class queuing network,
which has a product-form stationary distribution. In the language of Harrison
et al., we establish that baseline performance for this model class is
achievable.
  Indeed, as the key contribution of this work, we propose a method to emulate
such a reversible queuing network while satisfying congestion control and
scheduling constraints. Precisely, our policy is an emulation of
Store-and-Forward (SFA) congestion control in conjunction with
Last-Come-First-Serve Preemptive-Resume (LCFS-PR) scheduling policy.

Roberts","Roper resonance -- solution to the fifty year puzzle","23 pages, 19 figures",,,,"nucl-ex hep-lat hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For half a century, the Roper resonance has defied understanding. Discovered
in 1963, it appears to be an exact copy of the proton except that its mass is
50% greater. The mass is the first problem: it is difficult to explain with any
theoretical tool that can validly be used to study quantum chromodynamics
[QCD]. In the last decade, a new challenge has appeared, viz. precise
information on the proton-to-Roper electroproduction transition form factors,
reaching $Q^2\approx 4.5\,$GeV$^2$. This scale probes the domain within which
hard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form
factor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a
problem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper
resonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a
description of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed
understanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the
transition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly
complete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year
international effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has
presented a solution to the puzzle. Namely, the Roper is at heart the proton's
first radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a
meson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially
alters its electroproduction form factors on $Q^2<2m_N^2$, where $m_N$ is the
proton's mass. We describe the experimental motivations and developments which
enabled electroproduction data to be procured within a domain that is
unambiguously the purview of sQCD, thereby providing a real challenge and
opportunity for modern theory; and survey the developments in reaction models
and QCD theory that have enabled this conclusion to be drawn about the nature
of the Roper resonance.

various domains of science and engineering, such as solid-state physics,
chemical physics, and communication theory. An attractive test ground to
investigate this interaction is represented by superconductors with artificial
pinning sites, where magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) interact with
the pinning potential $U(r) = U(r + R)$ induced by a nanostructure. At a
combination of microwave and dc currents, fluxons act as mobile probes of
$U(r)$: The ac component shakes the fluxons in the vicinity of their
equilibrium points which are unequivocally determined by the local pinning
force counterbalanced by the Lorentz force induced by the dc current, linked to
the curvature of $U(r)$ which can then be used for a successful fitting of the
voltage responses. A good correlation of the deduced dependences $U(r)$ with
the cross sections of the nanostructures points to that pinning is primarily
caused by vortex length reduction. Our findings pave a new route to a
non-destructive evaluation of periodic pinning in superconductor thin films.
The approach should also apply to a broad class of systems whose evolution in
time can be described by the coherent motion of (quasi)particles in a periodic
potential.

temperature-dependent algorithm to separate strong from weak line transitions,
reformatting the large majority of the weaker lines into a cross-section data
file, and retaining the detailed line-by-line information of the fewer strong
lines. For any given molecule over the 0.3--30 {\micron} range, this algorithm
reduces the number of lines to a few million, enabling faster
radiative-transfer computations without a significant loss of information. The
final compression rate depends on how densely populated is the spectrum. I
validate this algorithm by comparing Exomol's HCN extinction-coefficient
spectra between the complete (65 million line transitions) and compressed (7.7
million) line lists. Over the 0.6--33 {\micron} range, the average difference
between extinction-coefficient values is less than 1\%. A Python/C

uniform boundary fluxes and has horizontally uniform initial conditions,
allowing its horizontal average to be compared to one-dimensional KPP tests. We
find the standard configuration of KPP consistent with LES across many forcing
regimes, supporting the physical basis of KPP. Our evaluation motivates
recommendations for ""best practices"" for using KPP within ocean circulation
models, and identifies areas where further research is warranted. Further, our
test suite can be used as a baseline for evaluation of a broad suite of
boundary layer models. The original treatment of KPP recommends the matching of
interior diffusivities and their gradients to the KPP predicted values computed
in the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL). However, we find that difficulties
in representing derivatives of rapidly changing diffusivities near the base of
the OSBL can lead to loss of simulation fidelity. We propose two alternative
approaches. We find the KPP entrainment buoyancy flux to be sensitive to
vertical grid resolution and details of how to diagnose the KPP boundary layer
depth. We modify the KPP turbulent shear velocity parameterization to reduce
resolution dependence. Additionally, our results show that the KPP
parameterized non-local tracer flux is incomplete due to the assumption that it
solely redistributes the surface tracer flux. However, examination of the LES
vertical turbulent scalar flux budgets show that non-local fluxes can exist in
the absence of surface tracer fluxes. This result motivates further studies of
the non-local flux parameterization.

the Hubble rate (up to $H_0 = 72.1^{+1.5}_{-1.7} \rm{km/s/Mpc}$, when
$N_{\rm{eff}}$ is free to vary), the $\sigma_8$ parameter remains too large to
reduce the $\sigma_8$ tension. Adding high multipole Planck polarization data
does not help since this data shows a strong preference for low values of

modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our

how the modulation of intrinsic metastable activity can shape sensory coding

This graph is generated using translation pairs obtained from an unsupervised

  We show that, in a low-resource setting, these type of vectors are successful

the presence of scale dependent features in the primordial spectrum --resulting
from cosmic inflation-- imprinted in the distribution of galaxies. Features may
appear as a consequence of non-trivial dynamics during cosmic inflation, in
which one or more background quantities experienced small but rapid deviations
from their characteristic slow-roll evolution. We consider two families of
features: localized features and oscillatory extended features. To characterise
them we employ various possible templates parametrising their scale dependence
and provide forecasts on the constraints on these parametrisations for LSST
like surveys. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis for three observables: cosmic
microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering and weak lensing. We find that
the combined data set of these observables will be able to limit the presence
of features down to levels that are more restrictive than current constraints
coming from CMB observations only. In particular, we address the possibility of
gaining information on currently known deviations from scale invariance
inferred from CMB data, such as the feature appearing at the $\ell \sim 20$
multipole (which is the main contribution to the low-$\ell$ deficit) and a
potential feature appearing at $\ell \sim 800$.

providing quantum speed-ups. We consider SDP instances with $m$ constraint
matrices, each of dimension $n$, rank at most $r$, and sparsity $s$. The first
algorithm assumes access to an oracle to the matrices at unit cost. We show
that it has run time
$\tilde{O}(s^2(\sqrt{m}\epsilon^{-10}+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-12}))$, with
$\epsilon$ the error of the solution. This gives an optimal dependence in terms
of $m, n$ and quadratic improvement over previous quantum algorithms when
$m\approx n$. The second algorithm assumes a fully quantum input model in which
the matrices are given as quantum states. We show that its run time is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m}+\text{poly}(r))\cdot\text{poly}(\log m,\log
n,B,\epsilon^{-1})$, with $B$ an upper bound on the trace-norm of all input
matrices. In particular the complexity depends only poly-logarithmically in $n$
and polynomially in $r$.

with respect to a set of measurements: Given $m$ measurements and a supply of
copies of an unknown state $\rho$ with rank at most $r$, we show we can find in
time $\sqrt{m}\cdot\text{poly}(\log m,\log n,r,\epsilon^{-1})$ a description of
the state as a quantum circuit preparing a density matrix which has the same
expectation values as $\rho$ on the $m$ measurements, up to error $\epsilon$.
The density matrix obtained is an approximation to the maximum entropy state
consistent with the measurement data considered in Jaynes' principle from
statistical mechanics.
  As in previous work, we obtain our algorithm by ""quantizing"" classical SDP
solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight method. One of our main
technical contributions is a quantum Gibbs state sampler for low-rank
Hamiltonians with a poly-logarithmic dependence on its dimension, which could

can reduce labeling costs for training a classifier by querying the expert to
provide the labels of most informative instances. This paper focuses on AL
methods for instance classification problems in multiple instance learning
(MIL), where data is arranged into sets, called bags, that are weakly labeled.
Most AL methods focus on single instance learning problems. These methods are
not suitable for MIL problems because they cannot account for the bag structure
of data. In this paper, new methods for bag-level aggregation of instance
informativeness are proposed for multiple instance active learning (MIAL). The
\textit{aggregated informativeness} method identifies the most informative
instances based on classifier uncertainty, and queries bags incorporating the
most information. The other proposed method, called \textit{cluster-based
aggregative sampling}, clusters data hierarchically in the instance space. The
informativeness of instances is assessed by considering bag labels, inferred
instance labels, and the proportion of labels that remain to be discovered in
clusters. Both proposed methods significantly outperform reference methods in
extensive experiments using benchmark data from several application domains.
Results indicate that using an appropriate strategy to address MIAL problems
yields a significant reduction in the number of queries needed to achieve the
same level of performance as single instance AL methods.

$\epsilon$-nearly solutions with squared distance at least $\Omega(d\epsilon)$.
The fundamental open question is whether the squared distance can be
independent of the number of vectors $n$.
  We answer this question affirmatively by proving that the squared distance of
any $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{13/2} \epsilon)$. Our approach is based
on a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm and consists of two
parts. First, we define a dynamical system based on operator scaling and use it
to prove that the squared distance of any $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^2
n \epsilon)$. Then, we show that by randomly perturbing the input vectors, the
dynamical system will converge faster and the squared distance of an
$\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{5/2} \epsilon)$ when $n$ is large enough
and $\epsilon$ is small enough. To analyze the convergence of the dynamical
system, we develop some new techniques in lower bounding the operator capacity,
a concept introduced by Gurvits to analyze the operator scaling algorithm.

programming and formal program verification. In particular, the types of
programs written in dependently typed programming languages (Agda, Idris, F*,

specifications can vary from being as simple as requiring the divisor in the
division function to be non-zero, to as complex as specifying the correctness
of compilers of industrial-strength languages. Successful compilation of a
program then guarantees that it satisfies its type-based specification.
  While dependent types allow many runtime errors to be eliminated by rejecting
erroneous programs at compile-time, dependently typed languages are yet to gain
popularity in the wider programming community. One reason for this is their
limited support for computational effects, an integral part of all widely used
programming languages, ranging from imperative languages, such as C, to
functional languages, such as ML and Haskell. For example, in addition to
simply turning their inputs to outputs, programs written in these programming
languages can raise exceptions, access computer's memory, communicate over a
network, render images on a screen, etc.
  Therefore, if dependently typed programming languages are to truly live up to
their promise of seamlessly integrating programming and formal program
verification, we must first understand how to properly account for
computational effects in such languages. While there already exists work on
this topic, ingredients needed for a comprehensive theory are generally
missing. For example, foundations are often not settled; available effects may
be limited; or effects may not be treated systematically.
  In this thesis we address these shortcomings by providing a comprehensive
treatment of the combination of dependent types and general computational
effects.

(walking at a constant speed or in a constant direction). Based on this idea,
we try to reduce the cybersickness caused by character movements in a First

blurring the screen during rotational movements to reduce cybersickness. We

with one dissipative fluid, described by a barotropic EoS $p = \omega \rho$, in
the framework of the full Israel-Stewart theory. The form of the bulk viscosity
has been assumed of the form $\xi = \xi_{0}\rho^{1/2}$. The relaxation time is
taken to be a function of the EoS, the bulk viscosity and the speed of bulk
viscous perturbations, $c_{b}$. The solution presents an initial singularity,
where the curvature scalar diverges as the scale factor goes to zero. Depending
on the values for $\omega$, $\xi_{0}$, $c_{b}$ accelerated and decelerated
cosmic expansion can be obtained. In the case of accelerated expansion, the
viscosity drives the effective EoS to be of quintessence type, for the single
fluid with positive pressure. Nevertheless, we show that only the solution with
decelerated expansion satisfies the thermodynamics conditions $dS/dt > 0$
(growth of the entropy) and $d^{2}S/dt^{2} < 0$ (convexity condition). We show
that an exact stiff matter EoS is not allowed in the framework of the full
causal thermodynamic approach; and in the case of a EoS very close to the stiff
matter regime, we found that dissipative effects becomes negligible so the
entropy remains constant. Finally, we show numerically that the solution is
stable under small perturbations.

undersampled MR acquisitions. Ideally network performance should be optimized

however, large datasets comprising hundreds of subjects scanned under a common
protocol are rare. The goal of this study is to introduce a transfer-learning
approach to address the problem of data scarcity in training deep networks for
accelerated MRI.
  Methods: Neural networks were trained on thousands of samples from public
datasets of either natural images or brain MR images. The networks were then
fine-tuned using only few tens of brain MR images in a distinct testing domain.
Domain-transferred networks were compared to networks trained directly in the
testing domain. Network performance was evaluated for varying acceleration
factors (2-10), number of training samples (0.5-4k) and number of fine-tuning
samples (0-100).
  Results: The proposed approach achieves successful domain transfer between MR
images acquired with different contrasts (T1- and T2-weighted images), and
between natural and MR images (ImageNet and T1- or T2-weighted images).
Networks obtained via transfer-learning using only tens of images in the
testing domain achieve nearly identical performance to networks trained
directly in the testing domain using thousands of images.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach might facilitate the use of neural networks
for MRI reconstruction without the need for collection of extensive imaging
datasets.

appropriate choice of the parameters, the fast process and the associated
control that arises from the weak convergence method decouple from each other.
We show that in this decoupling case one can use the weak convergence method to
characterize the limiting process via a ""viable pair"" that captures the

so-called maximum principles, which place bounds on the pressure field. It is
highly desirable to preserve these bounds on the pressure field in predictive
numerical simulations, that is, one needs to satisfy discrete maximum
principles (DMP). Unfortunately, many of the existing formulations for flow
through porous media models do not satisfy DMP. This paper presents a robust,
scalable numerical formulation based on variational inequalities (VI), to model
non-linear flows through heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media without
violating DMP. VI is an optimization technique that places bounds on the
numerical solutions of partial differential equations. To crystallize the
ideas, a modification to Darcy equations by taking into account
pressure-dependent viscosity will be discretized using the lowest-order
Raviart-Thomas (RT0) and Variational Multi-scale (VMS) finite element
formulations. It will be shown that these formulations violate DMP, and, in
fact, these violations increase with an increase in anisotropy. It will be
shown that the proposed VI-based formulation provides a viable route to enforce
DMP. Moreover, it will be shown that the proposed formulation is scalable, and
can work with any numerical discretization and weak form. Parallel scalability
on modern computational platforms will be illustrated through strong-scaling
studies, which will prove the efficiency of the proposed formulation in a
parallel setting. Algorithmic scalability as the problem size is scaled up will
be demonstrated through novel static-scaling studies. The performed
static-scaling studies can serve as a guide for users to be able to select an

Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for

transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream
neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How
can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a
network that constantly changes its architecture? Here, we demonstrate, using
novel Algebraic Topology techniques, that cognitive map's stability is a
generic, emergent phenomenon. The model allows evaluating the effect produced
by specific physiological parameters, e.g., the distribution of connections'
decay times, on the properties of the cognitive map as a whole. It also points
out that spatial memory deterioration caused by weakening or excessive loss of
the synaptic connections may be compensated by simulating the neuronal
activity. Lastly, the model explicates functional importance of the
complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different
levels of spatiotemporal granularity, by establishing three complementary
timescales at which spatial information unfolds. Thus, the model provides a
principal insight into how can the brain develop a reliable representation of

double state of two conformal fields theories with a holographic dual has a
circuit complexity increasing linearly in time, up to exponential time.

laser-irradiated microtubes. When the electrons of a microtube are blown away
by intense laser pulses, strong charge-separation electric fields are formed in
the microtube both along the axial and along the radial directions. By
controlling the time delay between the laser pulses and a pre-accelerated
proton beam injected along the microtube axis, we demonstrate that this proton
beam can be further accelerated by the transient axial electric field in the

suitable for cascading acceleration of protons to higher energy.

the magnetic interaction scale increases dramatically with increasing pressure,

increase network capacity. By reducing the size of cells, operators can pack
more (low-power) base stations in an area to better serve the growing demands,
without causing extra interference. However, this approach suffers from low
spectrum temporal efficiency. When a cell becomes smaller and covers fewer
users, its total traffic fluctuates significantly due to insufficient traffic
aggregation and exhibiting a large ""peak-to-mean"" ratio. As operators
customarily provision spectrum for peak traffic, large traffic temporal
fluctuation inevitably leads to low spectrum temporal efficiency. In this
paper, we advocate device-to-device (D2D) load-balancing as a useful mechanism
to address the fundamental drawback of small-cell architecture. The idea is to
shift traffic from a congested cell to its adjacent under-utilized cells by
leveraging inter-cell D2D communication, so that the traffic can be served
without using extra spectrum, effectively improving the spectrum temporal
efficiency. We provide theoretical modeling and analysis to characterize the
benefit of D2D load balancing, in terms of total spectrum requirements of all
individual cells. We also derive the corresponding cost, in terms of incurred
D2D traffic overhead. We carry out empirical evaluations based on real-world 4G
data traces to gauge the benefit and cost of D2D load balancing under practical
settings. The results show that D2D load balancing can reduce the spectrum
requirement by 25% as compared to the standard scenario without D2D load
balancing, at the expense of negligible 0.7% D2D traffic overhead.

3483 planets have been confirmed as of April 2017. The statistical results of
the planets show that there are two peaks around 1.5 and 2.0 in the
distribution of orbital period ratios. The observations indicate that a plenty
of planet pairs could have firstly been captured into mean motion resonances
(MMRs) in planetary formation. Subsequently, these planets depart from exact
resonant locations to be near MMRs configurations. Through type I migration,
two low-mass planets have a tendency to be trapped into first-order MMRs (2:1
or 3:2 MMRs), however two scenarios of mass accretion of planets and potential
outward migration play an important role in reshaping their final orbital
configurations. Under the scenario of mass accretion, the planet pairs can
cross 2:1 MMRs and then enter into 3:2 MMRs, especially for the inner pairs.
With such formation scenario, the possibility that two planets are locked into
3:2 MMRs can increase if they are formed in a flat disk. Moreover, the outward
migration can make planets have a high likelihood to be trapped into 3:2 MMRs.
We perform additional runs to investigate the mass relationship for those
planets in three-planet systems, and we show that two peaks near 1.5 and 2.0
for the period ratios of two planets can be easily reproduced through our
formation scenario. We further show that the systems in chain resonances (e.g.,
4:2:1, 3:2:1, 6:3:2 and 9:6:4 MMRs), have been observed in our simulations.

considering different properties of quantum many-body systems. In this paper,
we study a mapping between an important class of quantum systems namely quantum
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and Ising-like systems by using hypergraphs.
We show that the Hamiltonian corresponding to a CSS code on a hypergraph $H$
which is perturbed by a uniform magnetic field is mapped to Hamiltonian of a
Ising-like system on dual hypergraph $\tilde{H}$ in a transverse field.
Interestingly, we show that a strong regime of couplings in one of the systems
is mapped to a weak regime of couplings in another one. We also give some
applications for such a mapping where we study robustness of different
topological CSS codes against a uniform magnetic field including Kitaev's toric
codes defined on graphs and color codes in different dimensions. We show that a
perturbed Kitaev's toric code on an arbitrary graph is mapped to an Ising model
in a transverse field on the same graph and a perturbed color code on a D-colex
is mapped to a Ising-like model on a D-simplicial lattice in a transverse
field. In particular, we use these results to explicitly compare the robustness
of TC on different graphs in different dimensions. Interestingly, our results
show that the robustness of such topological codes defined on graphs decreases
with increasing dimension. Furthermore, we also use the duality mapping for
some self-dual models where we exactly derive the point of phase transition.

is based on a new index that quantifies the ability of any interference model

consider a specific wireless scenario of both conventional sub-6~GHz and

into the possibility of simplifying the set of dominant interferers, replacing
a Nakagami or Rayleigh random fading by an equivalent deterministic channel,
and ignoring antenna sidelobes. Our analysis reveals that in highly directional
antenna settings with obstructions, even simple interference models (such as
the classical protocol model) are accurate, while with omnidirectional
antennas, more sophisticated and complex interference models (such as the
classical physical model) are necessary. We further use the proposed index to
develop a simple interference model for mmWave networks that can significantly
simplify design principles of the important procedures for wireless
communication, such as beamforming, interference management, scheduling, and
topology control. Our new approach makes it possible to adopt the simplest

ill-posed inverse problem. Here we report on a novel approach to improve the
determination of real-time information in the form of spectral functions by
setting up a simulation prescription in imaginary frequencies. By carefully
distinguishing between initial conditions and quantum dynamics one obtains
access to correlation functions also outside the conventional Matsubara
frequencies. In particular the range between $\omega_0$ and $\omega_1=2\pi T$,
which is most relevant for the inverse problem may be more highly resolved. In
combination with the fact that in imaginary frequencies the kernel of the
inverse problem is not an exponential but only a rational function we observe
significant improvements in the reconstruction of spectral functions,
demonstrated in a simple 0+1 dimensional scalar field theory toy model.

Analysis of experimental data obtained in our previous study shows that the
oscillations are highly isotropic and nearly homogeneous in the bulk of a dust
crystal; oscillations of the neighboring particles are significantly
correlated. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of the particle
radius-vector along with the local particle number density fully define the
coupling parameter of the particle subsystem. The latter proves to be of the
order of 100, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the coupling
parameter estimated for the Brownian diffusion of particles with the gas
temperature. This means significant kinetic overheating of particles under
stationary conditions. A theoretical interpretation of the large amplitude of
oscillation implies the increase of particle charge fluctuations in the dust
crystal. The theoretical estimates are based on the ionization equation of
state for the complex plasma and the equation for the plasma perturbation
evolution. They are shown to match the results of experimental data processing.
Estimated order of magnitude of the coupling parameter accounts for the
existence of the solid-liquid phase transition observed for similar systems in
experiments.

DisPerSE. Significant mass and type/colour gradients are found for the whole
population, with more massive and/or passive galaxies being located closer to
the filament and wall than their less massive and/or star-forming counterparts.
Mass segregation persists among the star-forming population alone. The red
fraction of galaxies increases when closing in on nodes, and on filaments
regardless of the distance to nodes. Similarly, the star-forming population
reddens (or lowers its sSFR) at fixed mass when closing in on filament,
implying that some quenching takes place. Comparable trends are also found in
the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. These results
suggest that on top of stellar mass and large-scale density, the traceless
component of the tides from the anisotropic large-scale environment also shapes
galactic properties. An extension of excursion theory accounting for
filamentary tides provides a qualitative explanation in terms of anisotropic
assembly bias: at a given mass, the accretion rate varies with the orientation
and distance to filaments. It also explains the absence of type/colour
gradients in the data on smaller, non-linear scales.

via distribution-free random utility models and associated random preference
models. For such models, the predicted choice probabilities often form a
bounded and convex polyhedral set, or polytope. Polyhedral combinatorics have
thus played a key role in studying the mathematical structure of these models.
However, standard methods for characterizing the polytopes of such models are
subject to a combinatorial explosion in complexity as the number of choice
alternatives increases. Specifically, this is the case for random preference
models based on linear, weak, semi- and interval orders. For these, a complete,
linear description of the polytope is currently known only for, at most, 5--8
choice alternatives. We leverage the method of extended formulations to break
through those boundaries. For each of the four types of preferences, we build
an appropriate network, and show that the associated network flow polytope
provides an extended formulation of the polytope of the choice model. This
extended formulation has a simple linear description that is more parsimonious
than descriptions obtained by standard methods for large numbers of choice
alternatives. The result is a computationally less demanding way of testing the
probabilistic choice model on data. We sketch how the latter interfaces with
recent developments in contemporary statistics.

stepped-wedge (SW) cluster randomized trial (CRT) routinely depends upon the
specification of several nuisance parameters. If these parameters are
mis-specified, the trial could be over-powered, leading to increased cost, or
under-powered, enhancing the likelihood of a false negative. We address this
issue here for cross-sectional SW-CRTs, analyzed with a particular linear mixed
model, by proposing methods for blinded and unblinded sample size re-estimation
(SSRE). Blinded estimators for the variance parameters of a SW-CRT analyzed
using the Hussey and Hughes model are derived. Then, procedures for blinded and
unblinded SSRE after any time period in a SW-CRT are detailed. The performance
of these procedures is then examined and contrasted using two example trial
design scenarios. We find that if the two key variance parameters were
under-specified by 50%, the SSRE procedures were able to increase power over
the conventional SW-CRT design by up to 29%, resulting in an empirical power
above the desired level. Moreover, the performance of the re-estimation
procedures was relatively insensitive to the timing of the interim assessment.
Thus, the considered SSRE procedures can bring substantial gains in power when
the underlying variance parameters are mis-specified. Though there are
practical issues to consider, the procedure's performance means researchers
should consider incorporating SSRE in to future SW-CRTs.

increased expression of the cytoskeletal filament protein vimentin correlates
with metastatic potential. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism whereby vimentin
affects cell motility remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured the
effects of vimentin expression on the mechano-elastic and migratory properties

that vimentin stiffens cells and enhances cell migration in dense cultures, but
exerts little or no effect on the migration of sparsely plated cells. These

investigation because it provides a unique example of a macroscopic
manifestation of quantum mechanics. About 60 years later, scientists
successfully observed this phenomenon in the microscopic world though the
spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in helium nano-droplets. This
reduction of scale suggests that not only helium but also para-H2 (pH2) can be
a candidate for superfluidity. This expectation is based on the fact that the
smaller number of neighbours and surface effects of a finite-size cluster may
hinder solidification and promote a liquid-like phase. The first prediction of
superfluidity in pH2 clusters was reported in 1991 based on quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. The possible superfluidity of pH2 was later indirectly observed in
a spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in 2000. Since then, a growing
number of studies have appeared, and theoretical simulations have been playing
a special role because they help guide and interpret experiments. In this
review, we go over the theoretical studies of pH2 superfluid clusters since the

exhibits universal spectral correlations between eigenvalues separated by
distances ranging from one up to many mean level spacings. We use these
universal spectral characteristics of $\rho_A$ as a definition of chaos in the
wave function. A simple and precise characterization of such correlations is a
segment of linear growth at sufficiently long times, recently called the
""ramp"", of the spectral form factor. Specifically, numerical results for the
spectral form factor of $\rho_A$ of generic non-integrable systems, such as
one-dimensional quantum Ising and Floquet spin models, are found to exhibit an
universal ramp identical to that appearing for a random pure state, in which
$\rho_A$ is the Wishart random matrix. In addition, we study the development of
chaos in the wave function by letting an initial direct product state evolve
under the unitary time evolution. We find that the universal spectral
correlations as manifested by the ramp set in as soon as the entanglement
entropy begins to grow, and first develop for the eigenvalues at the top of the
spectrum of $\rho_A$, subsequently spreading over the entire spectrum at later
times. Finally, we study a prethermalized regime described by a generalized
Gibbs ensemble, which develops in a rapidly driven Floquet model at
intermediate times. We find that the prethermalized regime exhibits no chaos,
as evidenced by the absence of a ramp in the spectral form factor of $\rho_A$,
while the universal spectral correlations start to develop when the
prethermalized regime finally relaxes at late times to the fully thermalized

databases and has grown in both usage and new developments as a result of
increased data availability. Nevertheless, entity resolution has tradeoffs
regarding assumptions of the data generation process, error rates, and
computational scalability that make it a difficult task for real applications.
In this paper, we focus on a related problem of unique entity estimation, which
is the task of estimating the unique number of entities and associated standard
errors in a data set with duplicate entities. Unique entity estimation shares
many fundamental challenges of entity resolution, namely, that the
computational cost of all-to-all entity comparisons is intractable for large
databases. To circumvent this computational barrier, we propose an efficient
(near-linear time) estimation algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing.
Our estimator, under realistic assumptions, is unbiased and has provably low
variance compared to existing random sampling based approaches. In addition, we
empirically show its superiority over the state-of-the-art estimators on three
real applications. The motivation for our work is to derive an accurate
estimate of the documented, identifiable deaths in the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Our methodology, when applied to the Syrian data set, provides an estimate of
$191,874 \pm 1772$ documented, identifiable deaths, which is very close to the
Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) estimate of 191,369. Our work provides
an example of challenges and efforts involved in solving a real, noisy
challenging problem where modeling assumptions may not hold.

  International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automobiles are equipped with Electronic Control Units (ECU) that communicate
via in-vehicle network protocol standards such as Controller Area Network
(CAN). These protocols are designed under the assumption that separating
in-vehicle communications from external networks is sufficient for protection
against cyber attacks. This assumption, however, has been shown to be invalid
by recent attacks in which adversaries were able to infiltrate the in-vehicle
network. Motivated by these attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been proposed for in-vehicle networks that attempt to detect attacks by making
use of device fingerprinting using properties such as clock skew of an ECU. In
this paper, we propose the cloaking attack, an intelligent masquerade attack in
which an adversary modifies the timing of transmitted messages in order to
match the clock skew of a targeted ECU. The attack leverages the fact that,
while the clock skew is a physical property of each ECU that cannot be changed
by the adversary, the estimation of the clock skew by other ECUs is based on
network traffic, which, being a cyber component only, can be modified by an
adversary. We implement the proposed cloaking attack and test it on two IDSs,
namely, the current state-of-the-art IDS and a new IDS that we develop based on
the widely-used Network Time Protocol (NTP). We implement the cloaking attack
on two hardware testbeds, a prototype and a real connected vehicle, and show
that it can always deceive both IDSs. We also introduce a new metric called the
Maximum Slackness Index to quantify the effectiveness of the cloaking attack
even when the adversary is unable to precisely match the clock skew of the
targeted ECU.

that converge in small numbers of iterations even in the challenging
high-contrast, high-frequency regime of Helmholtz transmission problems.
Furthermore, the DDM presented in this text require only minor modifications to
handle the case of transmission problems in partially coated domains, while
still maintaining excellent convergence properties. We also investigate the

dimensional diffusion equation, here we drive an explicit formula for the
diffusion constant which avoids this reduction. Using this formula the
effective diffusion constant can be evaluated numerically without resorting to
Brownian simulations. In addition a perturbation theory can be developed in
$\varepsilon = h_0/L$ where $h_0$ is the characteristic channel height and $L$
the period. This perturbation theory confirms the results of Kalinay and Percus
(Phys. Rev. E 74, 041203 (2006)), based on the reduction, to one dimensional
diffusion are exact at least to ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^6)$. Furthermore, we show
how the Kalinay and Percus pseudo-linear approximation can be straightforwardly
recovered. The approach proposed here can also be exploited to yield exact
results an appropriate limit $\varepsilon \to \infty$, we show that here the
diffusion constant remains finite and show how the result can be obtained with
a simple physical argument. Moreover we show that the correction to the
effective diffusion constant is of order $1/\varepsilon$ and remarkably has a
some universal characteristics. Numerically we compare the analytical results
obtained with exact numerical calculations for a number of interesting channel
geometries.

directly probe the flow of energy and angular momentum in the model insulating
ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet. Following ultrafast resonant lattice
excitation, we observe that magnetic order reduces on distinct time scales of 1
ps and 100 ns. Temperature-dependent measurements, a spin-coupling analysis and
simulations show that the two dynamics directly reflect two stages of
spin-lattice equilibration. On the 1-ps scale, spins and phonons reach
quasi-equilibrium in terms of energy through phonon-induced modulation of the
exchange interaction. This mechanism leads to identical demagnetization of the
ferrimagnet's two spin-sublattices and a novel ferrimagnetic state of increased
temperature yet unchanged total magnetization. Finally, on the much slower,
100-ns scale, the excess of spin angular momentum is released to the crystal
lattice, resulting in full equilibrium. Our findings are relevant for all
insulating ferrimagnets and indicate that spin manipulation by phonons,
including the spin Seebeck effect, can be extended to antiferromagnets and into
the terahertz frequency range.

large scale properties of astrophysical or laboratory systems with
fluctuations.Practitioners commonly assume wide scale separation between mean
and fluctuating quantities, to justify equality of ensemble and spatial or
temporal averages.Often however, real systems do not exhibit such scale
separation. This raises two questions: (I) what are the appropriate generalized
equations of MFE in the presence of mesoscale fluctuations? (II) how precise
are theoretical predictions from MFE? We address both by first deriving the
equations of MFE for different types of averaging, along with mesoscale
correction terms that depend on the ratio of averaging scale to variation scale
of the mean. We then show that even if these terms are small, predictions of
MFE can still have a significant precision error. This error has an intrinsic
contribution from the dynamo input parameters and a filtering contribution from
differences in the way observations and theory are projected through the
measurement kernel.Minimizing the sum of these contributions can produce an
optimal scale of averaging that makes the theory maximally precise.The
precision error is important to quantify when comparing to observations because
it quantifies the resolution of predictive power. We exemplify these principles
for galactic dynamos, comment on broader implications, and identify
possibilities for further work.

mechanisms concerning the energy source, various kinds of core collapsed
supernovae explosion mechanisms during central gravitational collapse in
astrophysics. We also discuss the puzzle of possible association of
$\gamma$-ray burst with gravitational wave perturbation, the heat source for
the molten interior of the core of the earth and finally the puzzling problem
of the cooling of white dwarfs. We then make use of the estimations for the
space flux of magnetic monopoles (hereafter MMs) and nucleon decay induced by
MMs (called the Rubakov-Callen(RC) effect) to obtain the luminosity due to the
RC effect. In terms of the formula for this RC luminosity, we present a unified
treatment for the heat source of the Earth's core, the energy source for the
white dwarf interior, various kinds of core collapsed supernovae (Type II
Supernova (SNII), Type Ib Supernova (SNIb), Type Ic Supernova (SNIc), Super
luminous supernova (SLSN)), and the production mechanism for $\gamma$-ray
burst. This unified model can also be used to reasonably explain the possible
association of the short $\gamma$-ray burst detected by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray
Burst Monitoring Satellite (GBM) with the LIGO gravitational wave event
GW150914 in September 2015.

  Gong, Nanning Zheng","Deep Self-Paced Learning for Person Re-Identification","Accepted by Pattern Recognition",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person re-identification (Re-ID) usually suffers from noisy samples with
background clutter and mutual occlusion, which makes it extremely difficult to
distinguish different individuals across the disjoint camera views. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep self-paced learning (DSPL) algorithm to
alleviate this problem, in which we apply a self-paced constraint and symmetric
regularization to help the relative distance metric training the deep neural
network, so as to learn the stable and discriminative features for person
Re-ID. Firstly, we propose a soft polynomial regularizer term which can derive
the adaptive weights to samples based on both the training loss and model age.
As a result, the high-confidence fidelity samples will be emphasized and the
low-confidence noisy samples will be suppressed at early stage of the whole
training process. Such a learning regime is naturally implemented under a
self-paced learning (SPL) framework, in which samples weights are adaptively
updated based on both model age and sample loss using an alternative
optimization method. Secondly, we introduce a symmetric regularizer term to
revise the asymmetric gradient back-propagation derived by the relative
distance metric, so as to simultaneously minimize the intra-class distance and
maximize the inter-class distance in each triplet unit. Finally, we build a
part-based deep neural network, in which the features of different body parts
are first discriminately learned in the lower convolutional layers and then
fused in the higher fully connected layers. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of our method as compared
with the state-of-the-art approaches.

method in cold inflation. The model is studied in detail for three different
cases of dissipation and bulk viscous pressure coefficients. In the first case
where both coefficients are taken as a constant, it is shown that the case
could not portray warm inflationary scenario compatible with observational data
even it is possible to restrict the model parameters. For other cases, the
results shows that the model could properly predicts the perturbation
parameters in which they stay in perfect agreement with Planck data. As a
further argument, $r-n_s$ and $\alpha_s-n_s$ are drown that show the required
