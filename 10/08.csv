amplifier suitable for qubit readout. The device consists of two nondegenerate,
three-wave-mixing amplifiers that are coupled together in an interferometric
scheme, embedded in a printed circuit board. Nonreciprocity is generated by
applying a phase gradient between the same-frequency pumps feeding the device,
which plays the role of the magnetic field in a Faraday medium. Directional
amplification and reflection-gain elimination are induced via wave interference
between multiple paths in the system. We measure and discuss the main figures
of merit of the device and show that the experimental results are in good
agreement with theory. An improved version of this directional amplifier is
expected to eliminate the need for bulky, off-chip isolation stages that
generally separate quantum systems and preamplifiers in high-fidelity,
quantum-nondemolition measurement setups.

not have the knowledge of the channel code used at the transmitter and the aim
is to identify this unknown channel code corresponding to the given received
sequence. In this paper, we study this blind reconstruction problem for binary
cyclic codes. In the literature, several researchers have proposed blind
reconstruction algorithms that make use of the distribution of the syndromes
(remainders) of the received polynomials with respect to a candidate polynomial
for the generator polynomial of the cyclic code. However, very limited analysis
is available for the syndrome distribution and its properties. In this paper,
we study the syndrome structure of the received polynomials. Specifically, we
prove that the syndrome distribution of the noise-free sequence can either be
uniform or restricted uniform. We also provide the necessary and sufficient
conditions for it to be of the either type. For the noise-affected received
sequence we prove that, finding the syndrome distribution is in general
computationally intractable. We also apply these results to analyze the
performance of the existing methods and verify some of the assumptions made in
the literature for blind reconstruction.

large-scale sparse learning works efficiently when the underlying structures

vectors has been questioned in real applications. Therefore, we consider
nonsparse learning with the conditional sparsity structure that the coefficient
vector becomes sparse after taking out the impacts of certain unobservable

tableaux where cells can contain unordered sets of integers, with the added

of standard set-valued Young tableaux with three rows and a fixed number of

tableaux with $1$ integer in each first-row cell, $k-1$ integers in each
second-row cell, and $1$ integer in each third-row cell. For rectangular shapes
$\lambda=n^3$, such tableaux are placed in bijection with closed $k$-ary
product-coproduct prographs: directed plane graphs that correspond to finite
compositions involving a $k$-ary product operator and a $k$-ary coproduct
operator. That bijection is extended to three-row set-valued Young tableaux of
non-rectangular and skew shape, and it is shown that a set-valued analogue of

out two observations: First, the precise description of the charmonium

impact on the differential distributions and on the forward-backward asymmetry,
$A_{\rm FB}$, in a broad range of $q^2\ge 5$ GeV$^2$. Second, the shape of

unambiguous probe of the relative phases between $\psi$ and $\psi'$. Fixing the

symmetric water wheel, as special cases. Under physically reasonable

system. In order to determine parameter regimes giving chaotic dynamics in this
non-autonomous nonlinear system, we consider an application of competitive

are required to generalize the competitive modes analysis so that it is
applicable to non-autonomous systems. The non-autonomous nonlinear water wheel
model is shown to satisfy competitive modes conditions for chaos in certain

  Distributions using Simulated Tempering Langevin Monte Carlo","53 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS math.PR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key task in Bayesian statistics is sampling from distributions that are
only specified up to a partition function (i.e., constant of proportionality).
However, without any assumptions, sampling (even approximately) can be #P-hard,
and few works have provided ""beyond worst-case"" guarantees for such settings.
  For log-concave distributions, classical results going back to Bakry and
\'Emery (1985) show that natural continuous-time Markov chains called Langevin
diffusions mix in polynomial time. The most salient feature of log-concavity
violated in practice is uni-modality: commonly, the distributions we wish to
sample from are multi-modal. In the presence of multiple deep and
well-separated modes, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid mixing.
  We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated
tempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by
transitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze
this Markov chain for the canonical multi-modal distribution: a mixture of
gaussians (of equal variance). The algorithm based on our Markov chain provably
samples from distributions that are close to mixtures of gaussians, given
access to the gradient of the log-pdf. For the analysis, we use a spectral
decomposition theorem for graphs (Gharan and Trevisan, 2014) and a Markov chain
decomposition technique (Madras and Randall, 2002).

confirm its four bottom quark QCD nature or whether it is perhaps something
more exotic. We initiate an investigation in this direction by exploring the
ability of the \emph{normalized} fully differential decay width for decays to
four leptons to probe the underlying nature of a putative resonance including
$CP$ and tensor properties. We assume the first observed state is a spin-0

four leptons through $\Upsilon\Upsilon,\,\Upsilon\gamma$, and $\Upsilon Z$

edge $e$ whose removal leaves a convex quadrilateral, and replaces $e$ by the
opposite diagonal of the quadrilateral. It is well known that any triangulation
of a point set can be reconfigured to any other triangulation by some sequence
of flips. We explore this question in the setting where each edge of a
triangulation has a label, and a flip transfers the label of the removed edge
to the new edge.
  It is not true that every labelled triangulation of a point set can be
reconfigured to every other labelled triangulation via a sequence of flips. We
characterize when this is possible by proving the \emph{Orbit Conjecture} of
Bose, Lubiw, Pathak and Verdonschot which states that \emph{all} labels can be
simultaneously mapped to their destination if and only if \emph{each} label
individually can be mapped to its destination.
  Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a sequence of flips
to reconfigure one labelled triangulation to another, if such a sequence
exists, and we prove an upper bound of $O(n^7)$ on the length of the flip
sequence.
  Our proof uses the topological result that the sets of pairwise non-crossing
edges on a planar point set form a simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to a
high-dimensional ball (this follows from a result of Orden and Santos; we give
a different proof based on a shelling argument). The dual cell complex of this
simplicial ball, called the \emph{flip complex}, has the usual flip graph as
its $1$-skeleton. We use properties of the $2$-skeleton of the flip complex to
prove the Orbit Conjecture.

relevance is that observed H-D isotopic correlations among $\it T_C$, $\it P$,

for consideration unconventional high-$\it T_C$ superconductivity with
electronic-based enhancements. The present work examines Coulombic pairing
arising from interactions between neighboring S and H species on separate

correlation between boson energy and $\zeta$$^{-1}$. Suppression of $\it T_C$

scattering-induced pair breaking. Correspondence with layered high-$\it T_C$

objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be

algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the
segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity
functions compute their appropriate neighborhood size as they compute the
texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to
the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments
the image with an appropriate neighborhood for each object. We performed
experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz
database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently
published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our
method.

isotropic turbulence (HIT) is undertaken and its physical consequences
examined. This decomposition permits the normal parts of the tensor
(represented by the eigenvalues) to be separated explicitly from the non-normal
effects. Given the restricted {E}uler approximation to the VGT dynamics is
written in terms of the isotropic part of the pressure Hessian and the
invariants of the characteristic equation of the VGT (in turn expressed in
terms of the eigenvalues), the non-normal terms are related to the non-local
aspects of the dynamics and the anisotropic part of the pressure Hessian. Using
a direct numerical simulation of HIT, we show that the norm of the non-normal
part of the tensor is of a similar order to the normal part, highlighting the
importance of non-local effects. In fact, beneath the discriminant function in
a Q-R plot, all enstrophy arises from the non-normal term, meaning that
vorticity and intermediate strain eigenvector alignment in this region is an
immediate consequence of non-normality. A non-normal term appears in the
expressions for both enstrophy and total strain and cancels when calculating
the second invariant of the VGT, while the self-amplification of non-normality
and the normal straining of non-normality appear in the strain production and
enstrophy production equations and cancel when calculating the third invariant.
However, these terms are significant for understanding the full VGT dynamics,
explaining how flow structures evolve to a disc-like state despite the strain
eigenvalues sometimes indicating opposite (rod-like) behaviour, as well as
explaining vorticity and strain alignments in HIT.

finding is that flow shear enables and promotes social behavior in microbes by
increasing the group fragmentation rate and thereby limiting the spread of

nanotubes is quenched due to the fast nonradiative scattering to the dark
exciton state having a lower energy. We present a theoretical analysis to show
that by placing carbon nanotubes in an optical microcavity the bright exctonic
state may be split into two hybrid exciton-polariton states, while the dark
state remains unaltered. For sufficiently strong coupling between the bright
exciton and the cavity, we show that the energy of the lower polariton may be
pushed below that of the dark exciton. This overturning of the relative
energies of the bright and dark excitons prevents the dark exciton from
quenching the emission. Our resutls pave the way for a new approach to
band-engineering the properties of the nanoscale optoelectronic devices.

DeepNovo, a deep learning-based tool to address the problem of protein

in the context of de novo peptide sequencing [1] in which convolutional neural
networks and recurrent neural networks were applied to predict the amino acid
sequence of a peptide from its spectrum, a similar task to generating a caption
from an image. We further develop DeepNovo to perform sequence database search,
the main technique for peptide identification that greatly benefits from
numerous existing protein databases. We combine two modules de novo sequencing
and database search into a single deep learning framework for peptide
identification, and integrate de Bruijn graph assembly technique to offer a
complete solution to reconstruct protein sequences from tandem mass
spectrometry data. This paper describes a comprehensive protocol of DeepNovo
for protein identification, including training neural network models, dynamic

de Bruijn graph assembly. Training and testing data, model implementations, and

role in applications as diverse as modeling of extreme values and robust
inference. In the case of social networks, continuous mixtures of graph

introduce some simple families of network models based on continuous mixtures

these models allow more flexible modeling of cross-graph heterogeneity than is

We illustrate the utility of these baseline mixture models with application to

sheets (CSs) can form either prior to or during solar flare, and they are
essential for magnetic energy dissipation in the solar corona by enabling
magnetic reconnection. However static reconstruction of CS is rare, possibly
due to limitation inherent in available coronal field extrapolation codes. Here
we present the reconstruction of a large-scale pre-flare CS in solar active
region 11967 using an MHD-relaxation model constrained by SDO/HMI vector
magnetogram. The CS is found to be associated with a set of peculiar homologous
flares that exhibit unique X-shaped ribbons and loops occurring in a
quadrupolar magnetic configuration. This is evidenced by that the field lines
traced from the CS to the photosphere form an X shape which nearly precisely
reproduces the shape of the observed flare ribbons, suggesting that the flare
is a product of the dissipation of the CS through reconnection. The CS forms in
a hyperbolic flux tube, which is an intersection of two quasi-separatrix
layers. The recurrence of the X-shaped flares might be attributed to the
repetitive formation and dissipation of the CS, as driven by the photospheric
footpoint motions. These results demonstrate the power of data-constrained MHD
model in reproducing CS in the corona as well as providing insight into the
magnetic mechanism of solar flares.

sample high resolution simulation of galaxy formation and feedback, Illustris.
The high resolution of Illustris allows us to probe the kSZ power spectrum on
multipoles $\ell =10^3-3\times 10^4$. Strong AGN feedback in Illustris nearly
wipes out gas fluctuations at $k\gtrsim1~h~\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and at late times,
likely somewhat under predicting the kSZ power generated at $z\lesssim 1$. The
post-reionization kSZ power spectrum for Illustris is well-fit by
$\mathcal{D}^{z<6}_{\ell} = 1.38[\ell/3000]^{0.21}~\mu K^2$ over
$3000\lesssim\ell\lesssim10000$, somewhat lower than most other reported values
but consistent with the analysis of Shaw et al. Our analysis of the bias of
free electrons reveals subtle effects associated with the multi-phase gas
physics and stellar fractions that affect even linear scales. In particular
there are fewer electrons in biased galaxies, due to gas cooling and star
formation, and this leads to an electron bias less than one even at low
wavenumbers. The combination of bias and electron fraction that determines the
overall suppression is relatively constant, $f_e^2b^2_{e0} \sim 0.7$, but more
simulations are needed to see if this is Illustris-specific. By separating the
kSZ power into different terms, we find at least $6\, (10)\%$ of the signal at
$\ell=3000\, (10000)$ comes from non-Gaussian connected four-point density and
velocity correlations, $\left<\delta v \delta v\right>_{c}$, even without
correcting for the Illustris simulation box size. A challenge going forward
will be to accurately model long-wave velocity modes simultaneously with
Illustris-like high resolution to capture the complexities of galaxy formation

Of particular interest is the sample complexity, i.e., the number of
observations/samples needed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (the signal
energy divided by the noise variance) in order to drive the mean-square error
(MSE) to zero. Previous work showed that if the translations are drawn from the
uniform distribution, then, in the low SNR regime, the sample complexity of the
problem scales as $\omega(1/\text{SNR}^3)$. In this work, using a
generalization of the Chapman--Robbins bound for orbits and expansions of the
$\chi^2$ divergence at low SNR, we show that in the same regime the sample
complexity for any aperiodic translation distribution scales as

at minimizing the sum-rate of downlink transmissions by contaminating the
uplink pilots. In the second model, the attacker exploits its in-band
full-duplex capabilities to generate jamming signals in both the CSI estimation
and data transmission phases. We study these attacks under two downlink power
allocation strategies when the attacker knows and does not know the locations
of the BS and users. The formulated problems are solved using stochastic
optimization, Lagrangian minimization, and game-theoretic methods. A
closed-form solution for a special case of the problem is obtained.

generalizes the usual notion of involutions of Azumaya algebras over schemes

the equivalence classes obtained by this relation, and settle the question of
when an Azumaya algebra $A$ is Brauer equivalent to an algebra carrying an

ramified, nontrivial involutions of the base object. We observe that, if the

The resultant sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex and the global

combination with conventional convex optimization. To reduce the computation
complexity, a suboptimal DEBIT scheme is also proposed, for which the
optimization problem becomes linear programming. The achievable sum-rate
performance is analyzed and a closed-form lower bound is derived for the MWRN

Numerical results show that the DEBIT scheme significantly outperforms the

particular, the young star cluster Westerlund 2 can provide sufficient
non-thermal energy to account for the gamma-ray emission. In this scenario,

computation from state $S$ to state $S'$, there exists a constructive method to
go backwards from state $S'$ to state $S$. Besides its theoretical interest,
reversible computation is a fundamental concept which is relevant in many
different areas like cellular automata, bidirectional program transformation,
or quantum computing, to name a few.
  In this work, we focus on term rewriting, a computation model that underlies
most rule-based programming languages. In general, term rewriting is not
reversible, even for injective functions; namely, given a rewrite step $t_1
\rightarrow t_2$, we do not always have a decidable method to get $t_1$ from
$t_2$. Here, we introduce a conservative extension of term rewriting that
becomes reversible. Furthermore, we also define two transformations,
injectivization and inversion, to make a rewrite system reversible using
standard term rewriting. We illustrate the usefulness of our transformations in
the context of bidirectional program transformation.

important place in perspective of time efficiency. Motivated by this
observation, we exploit the basic quantum repeater scheme in perspectives of
not only the optimal rate of entanglement concentration but also the complexity
of local operations and classical communication. Firstly, we consider the case
where two two-qubit pure states are prepared. We construct a protocol with the
optimal entanglement concentration rate and less consumption of local

driving a cavity mode with a properly chosen two-tone field, to prepare two

(both one-way and two-way) steering could be achieved in the steady state with

Bell nonlocality is present under much more stringent conditions. We consider
two types of measurements, displaced parity and on-off detection, respectively.
We show that for both the measurements Bell violation requires very low
environmental temperature. For the parity detection, large Bell violation is
observed only in the transient state when the mechanical modes decouple from
the optical mode and with extremely small cavity losses and mechanical damping.
Whereas for the on-off detection, moderate Bell violation is found in the
steady state and robust against cavity losses and mechanical damping. Although
Bell violation with the parity detection seems extremely challenging to be
experimentally demonstrated, the conditions required for violating Bell
inequalities with the on-off detection are much less demanding.

the minimum potential energy, which overestimates the vacancy free energy by
60% and the stacking-fault energy by almost 300% at temperatures close to the

rules to handle data quality problems are possible. In this paper, we consider
of discovering such type of dependencies in which the left hand side is part of

strings with similar coding rules and different lengths are clustered together

greedy algorithm is introduced in which the clustering and aligning tasks can
be accomplished simultaneously. Because of the greedy algorithm's high time
complexity, several pruning strategies are proposed to reduce the running time.

is suggested to investigate interplay between storage overhead and repair
bandwidth as storage node failures occur. Large data centers with multiple
racks/disks or local networks of storage devices (e.g. sensor network) are good
applications of the suggested clustered model. In realistic scenarios involving
clustered storage structures, repairing storage nodes using intact nodes
residing in other clusters is more bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes
based on information from intra-cluster nodes. Therefore, it is important to
differentiate between intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair
bandwidth in modeling distributed storage. Capacity of the suggested model is
obtained as a function of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems,
namely, node storage capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster
repair bandwidth. The capacity is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to a
monotonic decreasing function of number of clusters, as the number of storage
nodes increases without bound. Based on the capacity expression, feasible sets
of required resources which enable reliable storage are obtained in a
closed-form solution. Specifically, it is shown that the cross-cluster traffic
can be minimized to zero (i.e., intra-cluster local repair becomes possible) by
allowing extra resources on storage capacity and intra-cluster repair
bandwidth, according to the law specified in the closed-form. The network
coding schemes with zero cross-cluster traffic are defined as intra-cluster

However, there is an inherent trade-off as using too many features leads to too

the machine learning algorithms' run-time is to only select a small number of
features by a feature selection algorithm. However, the run-time required by
the feature selection algorithm must also be taken into account. Also, the
classification accuracy should not suffer too much from the feature selection.

network by choosing a fixed number of initial seeds, formally referred to as
the influence maximization problem. It admits a $(1-1/e)$-factor approximation
algorithm if the influence function is submodular. Otherwise, in the worst
case, the problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of
$N^{1-\varepsilon}$. This paper studies whether this worst-case hardness result
can be circumvented by making assumptions about either the underlying network
topology or the cascade model. All of our assumptions are motivated by many
real life social network cascades.
  First, we present strong inapproximability results for a very restricted
class of networks called the (stochastic) hierarchical blockmodel, a special
case of the well-studied (stochastic) blockmodel in which relationships between
blocks admit a tree structure. We also provide a dynamic-program based
polynomial time algorithm which optimally computes a directed variant of the
influence maximization problem on hierarchical blockmodel networks. Our
algorithm indicates that the inapproximability result is due to the
bidirectionality of influence between agent-blocks.
  Second, we present strong inapproximability results for a class of influence
functions that are ""almost"" submodular, called 2-quasi-submodular. Our
inapproximability results hold even for any 2-quasi-submodular $f$ fixed in

primary (turbulent) deflagrations followed by a devastating secondary
explosion. The secondary explosion may propagate with a speed of up to 1000 m/s
producing overpressures of over 8-10 atm. Since detonation is the only
established theory that allows a rapid burning producing a high pressure that
can be sustained in open areas, the generally accepted view was that the
mechanism explaining the high rate of combustion in dust explosions is
deflagration to detonation transition. In the present work we propose a
theoretical substantiation of the alternative propagation mechanism explaining
origin of the secondary explosion producing the high speeds of combustion and
high overpressures in unconfined dust explosions. We show that clustering of
dust particles in a turbulent flow gives rise to a significant increase of the
thermal radiation absorption length ahead of the advancing flame front. This
effect ensures that clusters of dust particles are exposed to and heated by the
radiation from hot combustion products of large gaseous explosions sufficiently
long time to become multi-point ignition kernels in a large volume ahead of the
advancing flame front. The ignition times of fuel-air mixture by the
radiatively heated clusters of particles is considerably reduced compared to
the ignition time by the isolated particle. The radiation-induced multi-point
ignitions of a large volume of fuel-air ahead of the primary flame efficiently
increase the total flame area, giving rise to the secondary explosion, which
results in high rates of combustion and overpressures required to account for
the observed level of overpressures and damages in unconfined dust explosions,
such as e.g. the 2005 Buncefield explosion and several vapor cloud explosions
of severity similar to that of the Buncefield incident.

representation. Motivated by the success of Auto-Encoders, we first theoretical
summarize the general properties of all algorithms that are based on
traditional Auto-Encoders: 1) The reconstruction error of the input can not be
lower than a lower bound, which can be viewed as a guiding principle for
reconstructing the input. Additionally, when the input is corrupted with
noises, the reconstruction error of the corrupted input also can not be lower
than a lower bound. 2) The reconstruction of a hidden representation achieving
its ideal situation is the necessary condition for the reconstruction of the
input to reach the ideal state. 3) Minimizing the Frobenius norm of the
Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation has a deficiency and may result in
a much worse local optimum value. We believe that minimizing the reconstruction
error of the hidden representation is more robust than minimizing the Frobenius
norm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation. Based on the above
analysis, we propose a new model termed Double Denoising Auto-Encoders (DDAEs),
which uses corruption and reconstruction on both the input and the hidden
representation. We demonstrate that the proposed model is highly flexible and
extensible and has a potentially better capability to learn invariant and
robust feature representations. We also show that our model is more robust than
Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAEs) for dealing with noises or inessential features.
Furthermore, we detail how to train DDAEs with two different pre-training
methods by optimizing the objective function in a combined and separate manner,
respectively. Comparative experiments illustrate that the proposed model is
significantly better for representation learning than the state-of-the-art
models.

experimentally controlled by tuning the polymer/solvent interactions through pH

different ways: (1) by expanding $K$ as a Maclaurin series, perhaps after a

parametrix and associated with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value
problems for the linear stationary diffusion partial differential equation with
a variable non-smooth (or limited-smoothness) coefficient on Lipschitz domains
are formulated. The PDE right hand sides belong to the Sobolev
(Bessel-potential) space $H^{s-2}(\Omega)$ or $\widetilde H^{s-2}(\Omega)$,
$1/2<s<3/2$, when neither strong classical nor weak canonical co-normal
derivatives are well defined. Equivalence of the BDIEs to the original BVP,
BDIE solvability, solution uniqueness/non-uniqueness, as well as Fredholm
property and invertibility of the BDIE operators are analysed in appropriate
Sobolev spaces. It is shown that the BDIE operators for the Neumann BVP are not
invertible, however some finite-dimensional perturbations are constructed
leading to invertibility of the perturbed (stabilised) operators.

and describe two-mode squeezing for number and phase variables. When phase is
treated as a unitary quantum-mechanical operator, number and phase operators
satisfy an uncertainty relation. As a result, the usual definition of number
squeezing parameter becomes modified. Two-mode number squeezing occurs when the
number fluctuation goes below the SQL at the cost of enhanced phase
fluctuation. As an application of number-phase uncertainty, we consider bosons
or fermions trapped in a quasi-one dimensional double-well (DW) potential
interacting via a 3D finite-range two-body interaction potential with large
scattering length $a_s$. Under tight-binding or two-mode approximation, we
describe in detail the effects of the range of interaction on the quantum
dynamics and number-phase uncertainty in the strongly interacting or unitarity
regime $a_s \rightarrow \pm \infty$. Our results show intriguing coherent
dynamics of number-phase uncertainty with number-squeezing for bosons and phase
squeezing for fermions. Our results may be important for exploring new quantum
interferometry, Josephson oscillations, Bose-Hubbard and Fermi-Hubbard physics
with ultracold atoms in DW potentials or DW optical lattices. Particularly
interesting will be the question of the importance of quantum phase operators
in two-atom interferometry and entanglement.

(attractors), are revealed in the pseudo-Newtonian planar circular restricted
three-body problem, where the primaries have equal masses. The parametric
variation of the position as well as of the stability of the equilibrium points
is determined, when the value of the transition parameter $\epsilon$ varies in
the interval $[0,1]$. The multivariate Newton-Raphson iterative scheme is used
to determine the attracting domains on several types of two-dimensional planes.
A systematic and thorough numerical investigation is performed in order to
demonstrate the influence of the transition parameter on the geometry of the
basins of convergence. The correlations between the basins of attraction and
the corresponding required number of iterations are also illustrated and
discussed. Our numerical analysis strongly indicates that the evolution of the
attracting regions in this dynamical system is an extremely complicated yet
very interesting issue.

concentrations below 0.5% in the hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere, which is more

of object-oriented programming (OOP). This paradigm has a variety of concepts
with an abstraction level usually high for most beginners, even the ones who
already code in an imperative language. Furthermore, transitioning from
imperative programming to OOP is a complex issue, with various inappropriate
side effects. A significant effort has been pursued in the search of motivating
and attractive solutions for such issues. One of those is the use of playful
environments that merge games with learning. In this work, we report our
experience with OOP learning workshops by means of games, challenges and
competitions, supported by Greenfoot and Robocode learning environments. A
workshop with sophomore students in a Computer Engineering program is presented
here. Lessons learning to motive students include: design of motivating
examples, use of competitive challenges, and an appropriate ratio between
tutors and students. Results suggest that the workshop was a practical and
effective way to introduce OOP and motivate students to learn it.

unusual for an ion having both positive as well as negative oxidation state in
a particular compound. Structural analysis suggest that the alkaline earth
ammine borohydrides (AABH) with the chemical formula M (BH4)2(NH3)2 (M = Mg,
Ca, or Sr) where hydrogen is present in +1 and -1 oxidation states. In order to
understand the oxidation states of hydrogen and also the character of chemical
bond present in AABH we have made charge density, electron localization
function, Born effective charge, Bader effective charge, and density of states
analyses using result from the density functional calculations. Our detailed
analyses show that hydrogen is in amphoteric behavior with hydrogen closer to
boron is in negative oxidation state and that closer to nitrogen is in the
positive oxidation state. Due to the presence of finite covalent bonding
between the consitutents in AABH the oxidation state of hydrogen is
non-interger value. The confirmation of the presence of amphtoric behavior of
hydrogen in AABH has implication in hydrogen storage applications.

on MHD flow over a vertical plate that applies time dependent shear to the
fluid. This study is meant to provide framework for improved thermal system
where induced automated shear on chemical (fluid) will in- crease velocity of
fluid and hence enhances the smooth flow. This study will also throw light on
an important aspect of controlling temperature of thermal system in the context
of emitting thermal radiation. Exact expressions for velocity field,
temperature and mass concentration corresponding to the radiative flow of
viscous fluid have been calculated. These expressions are obtained by using
Laplace transform of corresponding fractional differential equations. The
expressions of temperature and mass concentration of fluid have been presented
in series form. However, velocity field is presented in the form of integral
solutions. All exact expressions satisfy initial and boundary conditions. Some
significant limiting cases of fluid parameters and of fractional parameters
have been discussed. Two special cases of shear stress; shear stress in the
form of Heaviside function and oscillating shear stress have also been taken
into account to compare the behavior of fluid motion graphically. An analysis
has also been prepared to compare analytical and numerical solutions for
concentration of fluid using numerical algorithm. Validity of analytical
solutions up to a certain order of accuracy has been es- tablished.
