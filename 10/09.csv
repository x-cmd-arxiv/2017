problems with important applications in power networks. This paper proposes the
scheduled-asynchronous algorithm to solve a distributed semidefinite
programming (SDP) formulation of the OPF problem. In this formulation, every
agent seeks to solve a local optimization with its own cost function, physical
constraints on its nodal power injection, voltage, and power flow of the lines
it is connected to, and decision constraints on variables shared with neighbors
to ensure consistency of the obtained solution. In the scheduled-asynchronous
algorithm, every pair of connected nodes in the electrical network update their
local variables in an alternating fashion. This strategy is asynchronous, in
the sense that no clock synchronization is required, and relies on an
orientation of the electrical network that prescribes the precise ordering of
node updates. We establish the asymptotic convergence properties to the
primal-dual optimizer when the orientation is acyclic. Given the dependence of
the convergence rate on the network orientation, we also develop a distributed
graph coloring algorithm that finds an orientation with diameter at most five
for electrical networks with geometric degree distribution. Simulations
illustrate our results on various IEEE bus test cases.

clusters acting on dust is the dominant feedback agent disrupting the largest
star-forming molecular clouds and thus regulating the star-formation process.
${\bf Methods:}$ We perform multi-frequency, 3D, RT calculations including
scattering, absorption, and re-emission to longer wavelengths for clouds with
masses of $10^4$-$10^7\,$M$_{\odot}$, with embedded clusters and a star
formation efficiencies of 0.009%-91%, and varying maximum grain sizes up to
200$\,\mu$m. We calculate the ratio between radiative force and gravity to
determine whether radiation pressure can disrupt clouds. ${\bf Results:}$ We
find that radiation acting on dust almost never disrupts star-forming clouds.
UV and optical photons to which the cloud is optically thick do not scatter
much. Instead, they quickly get absorbed and re-emitted by at thermal
wavelengths. As the cloud is typically optically thin to far-IR radiation, it
promptly escapes, depositing little momentum. The resulting spectrum is more
narrowly peaked than the corresponding Planck function with an extended tail at
longer wavelengths. As the opacity drops significantly across the sub-mm and
mm, the resulting radiative force is even smaller than for the corresponding
single-temperature black body. The force from radiation pressure falls below
the strength of gravitational attraction by an order of magnitude or more for
either Milky Way or starbust conditions. For unrealistically large maximum
grain sizes, and star formation efficiencies far exceeding 50% do we find that
the strength of radiation pressure can exceed gravity. ${\bf Conclusions:}$ We
conclude that radiation pressure acting on dust does not disrupt star-forming
molecular clouds in any Local Group galaxies. Radiation pressure thus appears
unlikely to regulate the star-formation process on either local or global
scales.

being properly equilibrated and thus can be described by a few thermodynamic
control variables. In contrast, glasses and other amorphous solids can be
arbitrarily far away from equilibrium and require a description of the history
of the conditions under which they formed. In this paper we describe how the
locality of interactions intrinsic to finite-dimensional systems affects the
stability of amorphous solids far off equilibrium. Our analysis encompasses
both structural glasses formed by cooling and colloidal assemblies formed by
compression. A diagram outlining regions of marginal stability can be adduced
which bears some resemblance to the quasi-equilibrium replica meanfield theory
phase diagram of hard sphere glasses in high dimensions but is distinct from
that construct in that the diagram describes not true phase transitions but
kinetic transitions that depend on the preparation protocol. The diagram
exhibits two distinct sectors. One sector corresponds to amorphous states with
relatively open structures, the other to high density, more closely-packed
ones. The former transform rapidly owing to there being motions with no free
energy barriers; these motions are string-like locally. In the dense region,
amorphous systems age via compact activated reconfigurations. The two regimes
correspond, in equilibrium, to the collisional or uniform liquid and the so
called landscape regime, respectively. These are separated by a spinodal line
of dynamical crossovers. Owing to the rigidity of the surrounding matrix in the
landscape, high-density part of the diagram, a sufficiently rapid pressure
quench adds compressive energy which also leads to an instability toward
string-like motions with near vanishing barriers. (SEE REST OF ABSTRACT IN THE

of Bubenik, de Silva and Scott endows the collection of representations of a

never been studied in the literature. It means that the distribution of SPPs
can only be invariant under location shifts within a linear subspace of the
domain. Theoretically, substationarity is a concept between stationariy and
nonstationarity, but it belongs to nonstationarity. To formally propose the
approach, the article provides the definition of substationarity and an
estimation method for the first-order intensity function. As the linear
subspace may be unknown, it recommends using a parametric way to estimate the
linear subspace and a nonparametric way to estimate the first-order intensity
function, indicating that it is a semiparametric approach. The simulation
studies show that both the estimators of the linear subspace and the
first-order intensity function are reliable. In an application to a forest
wildfire data set, the article concludes that substationarity of wildfire
occurrences may be assumed along the longitude, indicating that latitude is a

of 13 TeV, using $A^{\prime}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays and a data sample
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the
LHCb detector. The prompt-like $A^{\prime}$ search covers the mass range from
near the dimuon threshold up to 70 GeV, while the long-lived $A^{\prime}$
search is restricted to the low-mass region $214<m(A^{\prime})<350$ MeV. No
evidence for a signal is found, and 90% confidence level exclusion limits are
placed on the $\gamma$-$A^{\prime}$ kinetic-mixing strength. The constraints
placed on prompt-like dark photons are the most stringent to date for the mass
range $10.6 < m(A^{\prime}) < 70$ GeV, and are comparable to the best existing
limits for $m(A^{\prime}) < 0.5$ GeV. The search for long-lived dark photons is
the first to achieve sensitivity using a displaced-vertex signature.

strategy is based on the value of information criterion. This criterion
measures the trade-off between policy information and obtainable rewards. High
amounts of policy information are associated with exploration-dominant searches
of the space and yield high rewards. Low amounts of policy information favor
the exploitation of existing knowledge. Information, in this criterion, is
quantified by a parameter that can be varied during search. We demonstrate that
a simulated-annealing-like update of this parameter, with a sufficiently fast
cooling schedule, leads to an optimal regret that is logarithmic with respect
to the number of episodes.

non-Abelian version of the {\em brace distributive law} of [W.\ Rump, J.\

Okni\'nski, Commun.\ Math.\ Phys.\ {\bf 327} (2014), 101--116], the notion of a
{\em skew truss} is proposed. A skew truss consists of a set with a group
operation and a semigroup operation connected by a modified distributive law
that interpolates between that of a ring and a brace. It is shown that a
particular action and a cocycle characteristic of skew braces are already
present in a skew truss; in fact the interpolating function is a 1-cocycle, the
bijecitivity of which indicates the existence of an operation that turns a
truss into a brace. Furthermore, if the group structure in a two-sided truss is
Abelian, then there is an associated ring -- another feature characteristic of
a two-sided brace. To characterise a morphism of trusses, a {\em pith} is
defined as a particular subset of the domain consisting of subsets termed {\em
chambers}, which contains the kernel of the morphism as a group homomorphism.
In the case of both rings and braces piths coincide with kernels. In general
the pith of a morphism is a sub-semigroup of the domain and, if additional
properties are satisfied, a pith is a $\mathbb{N}_+$-graded semigroup. Finally,
giving heed to [I.\ Angiono, C.\ Galindo \& L.\ Vendramin, Proc.\ Amer.\ Math.\
Soc.\ {\bf 145} (2017), 1981--1995] we linearise trusses and thus define {\em
Hopf trusses} and study their properties, from which, in parallel to the

The problem of finding optimal trajectories in different homotopy classes in

solutions to this problem in several general classes of configuration spaces by
constructing presentations of fundamental groups and giving algorithms for
solving the \emph{word problem} in such groups. We present explicit results

scattering of photons by energy-nonconserving Hamiltonians into unidirectional
(chiral) waveguides, for example, with coherent pulsed excitation. The temporal
waveguide modes are a natural basis for characterizing scattering in quantum
optics, and afford a powerful technique based on a coarse discretization of
time. This overcomes limitations imposed by singularities in the
waveguide-system coupling. Moreover, the integrated discretized equations can
be faithfully converted to a continuous-time result by taking the appropriate
limit. This approach provides a complete solution to the scattered photon field
in the waveguide, and can also be used to track system-waveguide entanglement
during evolution. We further develop a direct connection between quantum
measurement theory and evolution of the scattered field, demonstrating the
correspondence between quantum trajectories and the scattered photon state. Our
method is most applicable when the number of photons scattered is known to be
small, i.e. for a single-photon or photon-pair source. We illustrate two
examples: analytical solutions for short laser pulses scattering off a
two-level system and numerically exact solutions for short laser pulses
scattering off a spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) or spontaneous
four-wave mixing (SFWM) source. Finally, we note that our technique can easily

during lung development can be recapitulated by a receptor-ligand based Turing

However, complex mesh deformations which occur during lung growth severely
limit the number of branch generations that can be simulated. A new Phase-Field

reaction-diffusion framework to these surfaces. In this paper, we present a
rigorous comparison between the Phase-Field approach and the ALE-based

gauge-symmetric model where $G_{L-R}$ is the left-right gauge symmetry and
$L_i$ is the $i-$flavor lepton number. We use the spontaneous breaking (SSB) of
$U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ to explain two discrepancies in the standard model: muon
anomalous magnetic moment and light neutrinos and its oscillations. The massive
neutral gauge boson, $Z_{\mu\tau}$, arising from the SSB can provide additional
contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In order to explain
neutrino masses, we employ the low-energy inverse seesaw mechanism by adding
three $G_{L-R}$ singlet fermions, $S_{e,\mu,\tau}$. The light neutrino mass
matrix from the inverse seesaw formula has a specific two-zero texture pattern
referred in the literature as the Type-C two-zero texture due to the
$U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry. This allows us to predict the values of the
CP-violating Dirac phase, Majorana phases, and the absolute value of light
neutrino masses in terms of the precisely measured mixing angles and mass
squared differences. The model accommodates a quasi-degenerate spectrum of
neutrino masses with inverted ordering. The calculated best-fit value of
$\delta_{CP}$ surprisingly matches with the current experimentally measured
best-fit value of $\delta_{CP}$. At $1\sigma$, the measured value of
$\delta_{CP}$ favors a $\theta_{23}>\pi/4$. At $1\sigma$, most of the parameter
space is within the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass and the
bound on the effective Majorana mass from neutrinoless beta decay.

in large-scale networked dynamical systems. Specifically, we address the
question of whether dynamic feedback controllers perform better than static
(memoryless) ones when subject to locality constraints. We consider distributed
linear consensus and vehicular formation control problems modeled over toric
lattice networks. For the resulting spatially invariant systems we study the
large-scale asymptotics (in network size) of global performance metrics that
quantify the level of network coherence. With static feedback from relative
state measurements, such metrics are known to scale unfavorably in lattices of
low spatial dimensions, preventing, for example, a 1-dimensional string of
vehicles to move like a rigid object. We show that the same limitations in
general apply also to dynamic feedback control that is locally of first order.
This means that the addition of one local state to the controller gives a
similar asymptotic performance to the memoryless case. This holds unless the
controller can access noiseless measurements of its local state with respect to
an absolute reference frame, in which case the addition of controller memory
may fundamentally improve performance. In simulations of platoons with 20-200
vehicles we show that the performance limitations we derive manifest as
unwanted accordion-like motions. Similar behaviors are to be expected in any
network that is embeddable in a low-dimensional toric lattice, and the same
fundamental limitations would apply. To derive our results, we present a
general technical framework for the analysis of stability and performance of
spatially invariant systems in the limit of large networks.

Brownian motion. Recognizing that the formulation using a Brownian motion is
only an idealization, in this paper, it is assumed that the environment is

Under broad conditions, it is shown that the systems under consideration can be
approximated by a controlled diffusion system. Based on the limit diffusion
system, control policies of the original systems are constructed. Such an
approach enables us to develop sustainable harvesting policies leading to near

magnetic effect in 2n-2 dimensions. This phenomenon is discussed specifically
for both weak and strong inter-fermion interactions in 1+2 dimensions. For QCD
in 1+3 dimensions with Dirac quarks, we show that in the strongly coupled phase
with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, this mechanism reveals itself in the
form of an induced pion condensation by centrifugation. We use this observation
to show that this effect causes a shift in the chiral condensate in leading
order, and to discuss the possibility for the formation of a novel pion
super-fluid phase in present heavy ion collisions at collider energies.

are introduced in our RDPG based learning framework: tail-step bootstrap of

agents. The proposed learning framework was implemented to solve the
Bipedal-Walker challenge in OpenAI's gym simulation environment where only

determined by the nonlocal dispersal kernel, diffusion rate and the maximum

with the wave speed at which the habitat is shifting, which indicates that the

we call the mirror game. In this game, Alice and Bob take turns saying numbers
belonging to the set $\{1, 2, \dots,2N\}$. A player loses if they repeat a
number that has already been said. Bob, who goes second, has a very simple (and
memoryless) strategy to avoid losing: whenever Alice says $x$, respond with
$2N+1-x$. The question is: does Alice have a similarly simple strategy to win
that avoids remembering all the numbers said by Bob?
  The answer is no. We prove a linear lower bound on the space complexity of
any deterministic winning strategy of Alice. Interestingly, this follows as a
consequence of the Eventown-Oddtown theorem from extremal combinatorics. We
additionally demonstrate a randomized strategy for Alice that wins with high
probability that requires only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt N)$ space (provided that Alice
has access to a random matching on $K_{2N}$).
  We also investigate lower bounds for a generalized mirror game where Alice
and Bob alternate saying $1$ number and $b$ numbers each turn (respectively).
When $1+b$ is a prime, our linear lower bounds continue to hold, but when $1+b$
is composite, we show that the existence of a $o(N)$ space strategy for Bob
implies the existence of exponential-sized matching vector families over
$\mathbb{Z}^N_{1+b}$.

that no claims about convergence properties of the hierarchies in [8] were ever

stated that there exist hierarchies based on DSOS and SDSOS optimization that
converge. This is indeed true as we discuss in this response. We also emphasize
that we were well aware that some (S)DSOS hierarchies do not converge even if
their natural SOS counterparts do. This is readily implied by an example in our

the spike. Our main goal is to gain a fine understanding of the asymptotics for
the log-likelihood ratio process, also known as the free energy, as a function
of the SNR. Our main results are twofold. We first prove that the free energy
has a finite-size correction to its limit---the replica-symmetric
formula---which we explicitly compute. This provides a formula for the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the planted and null models. Second, we
prove that below the reconstruction threshold, where it becomes impossible to
reconstruct the spike, the log-likelihood ratio has fluctuations of constant
order and converges in distribution to a Gaussian under both the planted and
(under restrictions) the null model. As a consequence, we provide a general
proof of contiguity between these two distributions that holds up to the
reconstruction threshold, and is valid for an arbitrary separable prior on the
spike. Formulae for the total variation distance, and the Type-I and Type-II
errors of the optimal test are also given. Our proofs are based on Gaussian

global solar magnetic field, which undergoes fundamental changes over the 11-yr
solar cycle. For instance, the wind terminal velocity is thought to be
anti-correlated with the expansion factor, a measure of how the magnetic field
varies with height in the solar corona, usually computed at a fixed height
($\approx 2.5 R_{\odot}$, the source surface radius which approximates the
distance at which all magnetic field lines become open). However, the magnetic
field expansion affects the solar wind in a more detailed way, its influence on
the solar wind properties remaining significant well beyond the source surface.
We demonstrate this using 3D global MHD simulations of the solar corona,
constrained by surface magnetograms over half a solar cycle (1989-2001). A
self-consistent expansion beyond the solar wind critical point (even up to
$10R_{\odot}$) makes our model comply with observed characteristics of the
solar wind, namely, that the radial magnetic field intensity becomes latitude
independent at some distance from the Sun, and that the mass flux is mostly
independent of the terminal wind speed. We also show that near activity
minimum, the expansion in the higher corona has more influence on the wind
speed than the expansion below $2.5 R_{\odot}$.

during the operation of the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and

function (GF) method is applied to solve the coupled-channel Dirac equation
with quadrupole-deformed Woods-Saxon potentials for the first time. The
detailed formalism for the partial-wave expansion of the Green's function is

the deformed GF method over a wide range of deformations and some decisive

associated standard errors that account for ""clustering"" of units, where
clusters are defined by factors such as geography. Clustering adjustments are
typically motivated by the concern that unobserved components of outcomes for
units within clusters are correlated. However, this motivation does not provide
guidance about questions such as: (i) Why should we adjust standard errors for
clustering in some situations but not others? How can we justify the common
practice of clustering in observational studies but not randomized experiments,
or clustering by state but not by gender? (ii) Why is conventional clustering a
potentially conservative ""all-or-nothing"" adjustment, and are there alternative
methods that respond to data and are less conservative? (iii) In what settings
does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address
these questions using a framework of sampling and design inference. We argue
that clustering can be needed to address sampling issues if sampling follows a
two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters are sampled
from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units are sampled from
the sampled clusters. Then, clustered standard errors account for the existence
of clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering can
be needed to account for design issues if treatment assignment is correlated
with membership in a cluster. We propose new variance estimators to deal with
intermediate settings where conventional cluster standard errors are
unnecessarily conservative and robust standard errors are too small.

of two dodecagonal structural units were presumed to be typical of such

was that regions with a rectangular arrangement of penetrated structural units

regions were then nucleated in contact with RAPU regions. The subsequent

integration) or a common set of samples with measurements for different feature
sets (i.e., vertical integration). In this article we introduce an approach for
simultaneous horizontal and vertical integration, termed Linked Matrix
Factorization (LMF), for the more general situation where some matrices share
rows (e.g., features) and some share columns (e.g., samples). Our motivating
application is a cytotoxicity study with accompanying genomic and molecular
chemical attribute data. In this data set, the toxicity matrix (cell lines
$\times$ chemicals) shares its sample set with a genotype matrix (cell lines
$\times$ SNPs), and shares its feature set with a chemical molecular attribute
matrix (chemicals $\times$ attributes). LMF gives a unified low-rank
factorization of these three matrices, which allows for the decomposition of
systematic variation that is shared among the three matrices and systematic
variation that is specific to each matrix. This may be used for efficient
dimension reduction, exploratory visualization, and the imputation of missing
data even when entire rows or columns are missing from a constituent data
matrix. We present theoretical results concerning the uniqueness,
identifiability, and minimal parametrization of LMF, and evaluate it with

inelastic Boltzmann equation is reconsidered. As usual, particles are taken as
inelastic hard disks or spheres, but now the coefficient of normal restitution
$\alpha$ is allowed to take negative values $\alpha\in[-1,1]$, a simple way of
modeling more complicated inelastic interactions. The distribution function of
the HCS is studied at the long-time limit, as well as for intermediate times.
At the long-time limit, the relevant information of the HCS is given by a
scaling distribution function $\phi_s(c)$, where the time dependence occurs
through a dimensionless velocity $c$. For $\alpha\gtrsim -0.75$, $\phi_s$
remains close to the gaussian distribution in the thermal region, its cumulants
and exponential tails being well described by the first Sonine approximation.
On the contrary, for $\alpha\lesssim -0.75$, the distribution function becomes
multimodal, its maxima located at $c\ne 0$, and its observable tails algebraic.
The latter is a consequence of an unbalanced relaxation-dissipation
competition, and is analytically demonstrated for $\alpha\simeq -1$ thanks to a
reduction of the Boltzmann equation to a Fokker-Planck-like equation. Finally,
a generalized scaling solution to the Boltzmann equation is also found
$\phi(c,\beta)$. Apart from the time dependence occurring through the
dimensionless velocity, $\phi(c,\beta)$ depends on time through a new parameter
$\beta$ measuring the departure of the HCS from its long-time limit. It is
shown that $\phi(c,\beta)$ describes the time evolution of the HCS for almost
all times. The relevance of the new scaling is also discussed.

orthogonal frequency division multiple access heterogeneous small cell
optimization comprehensively considering energy efficiency maximization, power

In this paper, we study the energy-efficient power allocation and wireless
backhaul bandwidth allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access
heterogeneous small cell networks. Different from the existing resource
allocation schemes that maximize the throughput, the studied scheme maximizes
energy efficiency by allocating both transmit power of each small cell base
station to users and bandwidth for backhauling, according to the channel state
information and the circuit power consumption. The problem is first formulated
as a non-convex nonlinear programming problem and then it is decomposed into
two convex subproblems. A near optimal iterative resource allocation algorithm
is designed to solve the resource allocation problem. A suboptimal
low-complexity approach is also developed by exploring the inherent structure
and property of the energy-efficient design. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparing with the existing

alternative way to obtain the results that can be derived by the existing

the literature where few results exist, since the IPS test is non-admissible.
Moreover, our approach has the advantage in deriving Edgeworth expansions of

form of an evanescent wave propagating along the surface with a spatially

redshift, offers the most direct probe of the dark energy equation of state.
One way to determine the Hubble parameter at different redshifts is essentially
differentiating the cosmic age or distance with respect to redshift, which may
incur large numerical errors with observational data. Taking the scenario that
the Hubble parameter increases monotonically with redshift as a reasonable
prior, we propose to enforce the monotonicity when reconstructing the Hubble
parameter at a series of redshifts. Tests with mock type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
data show that the monotonicity prior does not introduce significant biases and
that errors on the Hubble parameter are greatly reduced compared to those
determined with a flat prior at each redshift. Results from real SN Ia data are
in good agreement with those based on ages of passively evolving galaxies.
Although the Hubble parameter reconstructed from SN Ia distances does not
necessarily provide more information than the distances themselves do, it
offers a convenient way to compare with constraints from other methods.
Moreover, the monotonicity prior is expected to be helpful to other probes that
measure the Hubble parameter at multiple redshifts (e.g., baryon acoustic
oscillations), and it may be generalized to other cosmological quantities that
are reasonably monotonic with redshift.

impurity away from half-filling for finite magnetic fields, using the Ward
identities with careful consideration of the anti-symmetry and analytic
properties. The asymptotic form of the vertex function
$\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma';\sigma'\sigma}^{}(i\omega,i\omega';i\omega',i\omega)$ is
determined up to terms of linear order with respect to the two frequencies
$\omega$ and $\omega'$, as well as the $\omega^2$ contribution for
anti-parallel spins $\sigma'\neq \sigma$ at $\omega'=0$. From these results, we
also obtain a series of the Fermi-liquid relations beyond those of
Yamada-Yosida. The $\omega^2$ real part of the self-energy
$\Sigma_{\sigma}^{}(i\omega)$ is shown to be expressed in terms of the double
derivative $\partial^2\Sigma_{\sigma}^{}(0)/\partial \epsilon_{d\sigma}^{2}$
with respect to the impurity energy level $\epsilon_{d\sigma}^{}$, and agrees
with the formula obtained recently by Filippone, Moca, von Delft, and Mora in
the Nozi\`{e}res phenomenological Fermi-liquid theory [Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 95},
165404 (2017)]. We also calculate the $T^2$ correction of the self-energy, and
find that the real part can be expressed in terms of the three-body correlation
function $\chi_{\uparrow\downarrow,-\sigma}^{[3]} = \partial
\chi_{\uparrow\downarrow}/\partial \epsilon_{d,-\sigma}^{}$. We also provide an
alternative derivation of the asymptotic form of the vertex function.
Specifically, we calculate the skeleton diagrams for the vertex function
$\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma;\sigma\sigma}^{}(i\omega,0;0,i\omega)$ for parallel spins
up to order $U^4$ in the Coulomb repulsion $U$. It directly clarifies the fact
that the analytic components of order $\omega$ vanish as a result of the
cancellation of four related Feynman diagrams which are related to each other
through the anti-symmetry operation.

important role in determining critical point and critical exponents from the
size-dependent behaviors of quantities in the thermodynamic limit. For
percolation phase transition, the finite-size scaling form for the reduced size
of largest cluster has been extended to cluster ranked $R$. However, this is
invalid for explosive percolation as our results show. Besides, the behaviors
of largest increase of largest cluster induced by adding single link or node
have also been used to investigate the critical properties of percolation and
several new exponents $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $1/\nu_1$ and $1/\nu_2$ are defined
while their relation with $\beta/\nu$ and $1/\nu$ is unknown. Through the
analysis of asymptotic properties of size jump behaviors, we obtain correct
critical exponents and develop a new approach to finite size scaling theory
where sizes of ranked clusters are averaged at same distances from the
sample-dependent pseudo-critical point in each realization rather than
averaging at same value of control parameter.

discontinuous phase transition. In the evolution process, the size of largest

of peaks corresponding to the jumps of $s_1$ from one stair to another. Several
largest jumps of the size of largest cluster from single edge are studied by
extensive Monte Carlo simulation. $\overline{\Delta}_k(N)$ which is the mean of
the $k$th largest jump of largest cluster, $\overline{r}_k(N)$ which is the
corresponding averaged edge density, $\sigma_{\Delta,k}(N)$ which is the
standard deviation of $\Delta_k$ and $\sigma_{r,k}(N)$ which is the standard
deviation of $r_k$ are analyzed. Rich power law behaviours are found for
$\overline{r}_k(N)$, $\sigma_{\Delta,k}(N)$ and $\sigma_{r,k}(N)$ with critical
exponents denoted as $1/\nu_1$, $(\beta/\nu)_2$ and $1/\nu_2$. Unlike
continuous percolation where the exact critical thresholds and critical
exponent $1/\nu_1$ are used for finite size scaling, the size-dependent pseudo
critical thresholds $\overline{r}_k(N)$ and $1/\nu_2$ works for the data
collapse of the curves of largest cluster and its fluctuation in discontinuous
percolation in BFW model. Further, data collapse can be obtained part by part.
That is, $s_1(r,N)$ can be collapsed for each jump from one stair to another

Nonparametric, composite likelihood-based, and Bayesian approaches have been

physical descriptions of systems that are independent of the precise
microscopic details or energy scales. A prime example is the Fermi gas with
unitarity limited interactions, whose universal properties are relevant to
systems ranging from atomic gases at microkelvin temperatures to the inner
crust of neutron stars. Here we address the question of whether unitary Bose
systems can possess a similar universality. We consider the simplest strongly
interacting Bose system, where we have an impurity particle (""polaron"")
resonantly interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Focusing on the
ground state of the equal-mass system, we use a variational wave function for
the polaron that includes up to three Bogoliubov excitations of the BEC, thus
allowing us to capture both Efimov trimers and associated tetramers. Unlike the
Fermi case, we find that the length scale associated with Efimov trimers (i.e.,
the three-body parameter) can strongly affect the polaron's behaviour, even at
boson densities where there are no well-defined Efimov states. However, by
comparing our results with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we argue
that the polaron energy is a \emph{universal} function of the Efimov three-body
parameter for sufficiently low boson densities. We further support this
conclusion by showing that the energies of the deepest bound Efimov trimers and
tetramers at unitarity are universally related to one another, regardless of
the microscopic model. On the other hand, we find that the quasiparticle
residue and effective mass sensitively depend on the coherence length $\xi$ of
the BEC, with the residue tending to zero as $\xi$ diverges, in a manner akin
to the orthogonality catastrophe.

one-dimensional heat diffusion model that describes the thermal performance of
the wall. These inputs include spatially-variable functions that characterise
the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of the wall. We
encode our computational framework in an algorithm that sequentially updates
our probabilistic knowledge of the thermophysical properties as new
measurements become available, and thus enables an on-the-fly uncertainty
quantification of these properties. In addition, the proposed algorithm enables
us to investigate the effect of the discretisation of the underlying heat
diffusion model on the accuracy of estimates of thermophysical properties and
the corresponding predictive distributions of heat flux. By means of
virtual/synthetic and real experiments we show the capabilities of the proposed
approach to (i) characterise heterogenous thermophysical properties associated
with, for example, unknown cavities and insulators; (ii) obtain rapid and
accurate uncertainty estimates of effective thermal properties (e.g. thermal
transmittance); and (iii) accurately compute an statistical description of the
thermal performance of the wall which is, in turn, crucial in evaluating
possible retrofit measures.

two modest mechanisms based on observation of the characteristics of age group

For this class of models one way in which one can prove the phase transition is
via a kind of Peierls contour argument, using the adaptation of the
Fr\""ohlich-Spencer contours for $\alpha \neq 0$, proposed by Cassandro,
Ferrari, Merola and Presutti. As proved by Fr\""ohlich and Spencer for

$\alpha \in (0,\alpha_{+})$ for $\alpha_+=\log(3)/\log(2)-1$, although in the

assumed that $J(1)\gg1$, we can show that this condition can be removed in the
contour analysis. In addition, combining our theorem with a recent result of
Littin and Picco we prove the persistence of the contour proof of the phase
transition for any $\alpha \in [0,1)$. Moreover, we show that when we add a
magnetic field decaying to zero, given by $h_x= h_*\cdot(1+|x|)^{-\gamma}$ and

exhibits many exotic properties due to long-range quantum entanglements. Its
elementary excitations are anyons such as spinons carrying fractionalized spin
quantum number and visons carrying emergent Z2 gauge flux. However,
experimental detection of these anyons remains elusive. The difficulties lie
not only in the fact that there exists few candidates for Z2 quantum spin
liquids but also in that visons are magnetically inert hence immune to
available experimental techniques. Here we have studied the spin excitations
and specific heats of kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr and
Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr, which consists of two-dimensional Cu$^{2+}$ kagome layers
with either Cu$^{2+}$ or Zn$^{2+}$ ions in between. By combining the first
principle calculations and inelastic neutron scattering data in the former, we
show that the dominate couplings in Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr are between the nearest
neighbor spins within the kagome planes, and the kagome and interlayer spin
systems are essentially decoupled above the antiferromagnetic transition
temperature. The intrinsic spin excitations and specific heats of the kagome
layers for Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr are thus derived by removing the contributions
from the residual interlayer Cu$^{2+}$ magnetic impurities. Accordingly, the
kagome spin system exhibits spin continuum with momentum-dependent spin gap and
a large magnetic entropy at low temperature that is insensitive to magnetic
field, which can be understood as the evidences of spinons and visons in this
kagome quantum spin liquid candidate. Our results suggest the existence of the
Z2 anyons in the material, and therefore provide a comprehensive set of
evidences for the Z2 topological order in kagome quantum spin liquid and bring
their choreographed entanglement dances to the stage of real materials.

planetary system formation. CO molecular emission is often used as a tracer of
gas mass in the disk. In this study we consider the ability of CO to trace the
gas mass over a wide range of disk structural parameters and search for
chemical species that could possibly be used as alternative mass tracers to CO.
Specifically, we apply detailed astrochemical modeling to a large set of models
of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, to select molecules with
abundances correlated with the disk mass and being relatively insensitive to
other disk properties. We do not consider sophisticated dust evolution models,
restricting ourselves with the standard astrochemical assumption of $0.1~\mu $m
dust. We find that CO is indeed the best molecular tracer for total gas mass,
despite the fact that it is not the main carbon carrier, provided reasonable
assumptions about CO abundance in the disk are used. Typically, chemical
reprocessing lowers the abundance of CO by a factor of 3, compared to the case
of photo-dissociation and freeze-out as the only ways of CO depletion. On

events in general, leave spectral fingerprints, for example due to the
formation of HCN. During the interaction, lightning or other flash--ionisation

Quasi-rectangular waveguides with a large cross section were used, with a

with various lengths from 22 to 74 mm. Using a mode-locked laser delivering
6-ps pulses at 1064 nm wavelength with a repetition rate of 20 MHz, 15% of the
incoming power was coupled through the waveguide, making maximum average powers
of up to 15 mW available in the waveguide. Second-harmonic output was observed
with a delay of minutes to several hours after the initial turn-on of pump
radiation, showing a fast growth rate between 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$,
with the shortest delay and highest growth rate at the highest input power.
After this first, initial build-up, the second-harmonic became generated
instantly with each new turn-on of the pump laser power. Phase matching was
found to be present independent of the used waveguide width, although the
latter changes the fundamental and second-harmonic phase velocities. We address
the presence of a second-order nonlinearity and phase matching, involving an
initial, power-dependent build-up, to the coherent photogalvanic effect. The
effect, via the third-order nonlinearity and multiphoton absorption leads to a
spatially patterned charge separation, which generates a spatially periodic,
semi-permanent, DC-field-induced second-order susceptibility with a period that
is appropriate for quasi-phase matching. The maximum measured second-harmonic
conversion efficiency amounts to 0.4% in a waveguide with 0.9 x 1 {\mu}m$^2$

strongly-interacting Majorana fermions. We numerically investigate eigenstate
thermalization for specific few-body operators in the original SYK model as
well as its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension and find evidence that
these models satisfy ETH. We discuss the implications of ETH for a
gravitational dual and the quantum information-theoretic properties of SYK it
suggests.

kernelized version have still a wide audience because of their conceptual
simplicity and efficacy. However, the systematic application of the kernelized
version of k-means is hampered by its inherent square scaling in memory with
the number of samples. In this contribution, we devise an approximate strategy
to minimize the kernel k-means cost function in which the trade-off between
accuracy and velocity is automatically ruled by the available system memory.
Moreover, we define an ad-hoc parallelization scheme well suited for hybrid
cpu-gpu state-of-the-art parallel architectures. We proved the effectiveness
both of the approximation scheme and of the parallelization method on standard
UCI datasets and on molecular dynamics (MD) data in the realm of computational
chemistry. In this applicative domain, clustering can play a key role for both
quantitively estimating kinetics rates via Markov State Models or to give
qualitatively a human compatible summarization of the underlying chemical
phenomenon under study. For these reasons, we selected it as a valuable
real-world application scenario.

fluctuating state. This opens up exciting possibilities such as the observation
of systems exploring their energy landscape through monopole quasiparticle
creation, potentially leading to ASI magnetricity, and to directly observe
unconventional phase transitions. In this work we have measured and analysed
the magnetic relaxation of thermally active ASI systems by means of SQUID
magnetometry. We have investigated the effect of the interaction strength on
the magnetization dynamics at different temperatures in the range where the
nanomagnets are thermally active and have observed that they follow an
Arrhenius-type N\'eel-Brown behaviour. An unexpected negative correlation of
the average blocking temperature with the interaction strength is also
observed, which is supported by Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization
relaxation measurements show faster relaxation for more strongly coupled
nanoelements with similar dimensions. The analysis of the stretching exponents
obtained from the measurements suggest 1-D chain-like magnetization dynamics.
This indicates that the nature of the interactions between nanoelements lowers
the dimensionality of the ASI from 2-D to 1-D. Finally, we present a way to
quantify the effective interaction energy of a square ASI system, and compare
it to the interaction energy calculated from a simple dipole model and also to
the magnetostatic energy computed with micromagnetic simulations.

belt architecture. One hypothesis for explaining the gap between the belts is
the presence of one or more planets dynamically carving it. This work aims to
investigate this scenario in systems harboring two components debris disks. All
the targets in the sample were observed with the SPHERE instrument which
performs high-contrast direct imaging. Positions of the inner and outer belts
were estimated by SED fitting of the infrared excesses or, when available, from
resolved images of the disk. Very few planets have been observed so far in
debris disks gaps and we intended to test if such non-detections depend on the
observational limits of the present instruments. This aim is achieved by
deriving theoretical predictions of masses, eccentricities and semi-major axes
of planets able to open the observed gaps and comparing such parameters with
detection limits obtained with SPHERE. The relation between the gap and the
planet is due to the chaotic zone around the orbit of the planet. The radial
extent of this zone depends on the mass ratio between the planet and the star,
on the semi-major axis and on the eccentricity of the planet and it can be
estimated analytically. We apply the formalism to the case of one planet on a
circular or eccentric orbit. We then consider multi-planetary systems: 2 and 3
equal-mass planets on circular orbits and 2 equal-mass planets on eccentric
orbits in a packed configuration. We then compare each couple of values (M,a),
derived from the dynamical analysis of single and multiple planetary models,
with the detection limits obtained with SPHERE. Our results show that the
apparent lack of planets in gaps between double belts could be explained by the
presence of a system of two or more planets possibly of low mass and on an
eccentric orbits whose sizes are below the present detection limits.

addition to elegant abstraction -- they strengthen soundness and completeness

treatment of Stone-type duality for the structures that interpret bunched
logics, starting with the weakest systems, recovering the familiar BI and
Boolean BI (BBI), and extending to both classical and intuitionistic Separation
Logic. We demonstrate the uniformity and modularity of this analysis by
additionally capturing the bunched logics obtained by extending BI and BBI with
modalities and multiplicative connectives corresponding to disjunction,
negation and falsum. This includes the logic of separating modalities (LSM), De
Morgan BI (DMBI), Classical BI (CBI), and the sub-classical family of logics
extending Bi-intuitionistic (B)BI (Bi(B)BI). We additionally obtain as
corollaries soundness and completeness theorems for the specific Kripke-style
models of these logics as presented in the literature: for DMBI, the
sub-classical logics extending BiBI and a new bunched logic, Concurrent Kleene
BI (connecting our work to Concurrent Separation Logic), this is the first time
soundness and completeness theorems have been proved. We thus obtain a
comprehensive semantic account of the multiplicative variants of all standard
propositional connectives in the bunched logic setting. This approach
synthesises a variety of techniques from modal, substructural and categorical
logic and contextualizes the ""resource semantics"" interpretation underpinning
Separation Logic amongst them.

useful: on the one hand, it allows the correction of the energy of the event,
which varies according to position, and on the other hand it provides an extra

Experimental measurements of the ECRH deposition profile have been taken in
three operating scenarios: L-mode, H-mode and negative triangularity. Each
scenario corresponds to distinct turbulence characteristics in the edge region
through which the beam must propagate. The measured ECRH deposition profile is
significantly broadened by comparison to the profile predicted by the ray
tracing code TORAY-GA and has been shown to scale with the severity of edge
turbulence. Conventional ray tracing does not include the effects of turbulence
and therefore a 3D full-wave cold plasma finite difference time domain code
EMIT-3D is presented and used for the simulations. The turbulence is generated
through the Hermes model in the BOUT++ framework which takes as input the
measured time averaged electron density, temperature and magnetic field
profiles for the specific shot in question. The simulated turbulence is
constrained to match the experimentally measured (by use of the BES and DBS
systems) correlation length and normalised fluctuation levels. The predictions
of the beam broadening from the simulations are found to agree very well with
the experimentally-observed broadening in all cases: L-mode, H-mode and
negative triangularity. Due to the large gradients within the H-mode edge, the
resolution uncertainty and error in the measurement from Thomson scattering and
BES diagnostics result in a spread in the simulated turbulence amplitude. In
light of this a parameter scan through the range in experimental diagnostic

Recent reported experiments agree with the presented theory and thereby it is
shown that the resonant-driven four-level system is an interesting source for

unlikeliness to observe antibunching for the delay time $ \tau=0 $ in the
exciton-biexciton correlation functions in such experiments, since antibunching
stems from a coherent and in-phase superposition of different photon emission
events. Due to the occuring laser photon scattering, this coherent

measurements or constraints on the HI masses of 844 galaxies from the Catalogue
of Isolated Galaxies (CIG), obtained with our own observations at Arecibo,
Effelsberg, Nancay and GBT, and spectra from the literature. Cuts are made to
this sample to ensure isolation and a high level of completeness. We then fit
HI scaling relations based on luminosity, optical diameter and morphology. Our
regression model incorporates all the data, including upper limits, and
accounts for uncertainties in both variables, as well as distance
uncertainties. The scaling relation of HI mass with optical diameter is in good
agreement with that of Haynes & Giovanelli 1984, but our relation with
luminosity is considerably steeper. This is attributed to the large
uncertainties in the luminosities, which introduce a bias when using OLS
regression (used previously), and the different morphology distributions of the
samples. We find that the main effect of morphology on the relations is to
increase the intercept and flatten the slope towards later types. These trends
were not evident in previous works due to the small number of detected
early-type galaxies. The HI scaling relations of the AMIGA sample define an
up-to-date metric of the HI content of almost ""nurture free"" galaxies. These
relations allow the expected HI mass, in the absence of interactions, of a
galaxy to be predicted to within 0.25 dex, and are thus suitable for use as
statistical measures of the impact of interactions on the neutral gas content

network, and the ability to detect such effects could have profound
implications for a number of real-world problems. Most existing techniques
focus individually on either local or global aspects of the problem or treat
the two in isolation from each other. In this paper we propose a novel network

local and global change points on dynamic networks via a unified generative
framework. Our model is built upon the popular mixed membership stochastic
blockmodels (MMSB) with sparse co-evolving patterns. We derive an efficient

makes it more suitable for big data sets, such as satellite and radar images,

structure of Fourier exponents, i. e. on how good they can be approximated by
rational numbers. In additional, as appears from the definition, the inclusion
length carries some information about the translation numbers (almost periods).
Our result is a lower bound of the growth rate of the inclusion interval of a
quasiperiodic function (theorem 3). Here we use methods from dimension theory.
We do not assume anything about exponents, but rationally independence. This
suggest an idea that this lower bound can be reached (in asymptotic sense) for
some ""bad"" exponents. Koichiro Naito in his papers on estimates of the fractal
dimension of almost periodic attractors proved an upper bound of the inclusion
length for some class of a.p. functions, using simultaneous Diophantine
approximations. For the special case of badly approximable exponents we can see
that the both estimates (if we consider them as asymptotic estimates) are
coincide (see theorem 4). We hope that ideas and results presented in this
paper can be useful not only to understand the nature of badly approximable

Gravitational Waves Program. The main scientific goal of AliCPT project is to
probe the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) originated from the very early
Universe.
  The AliCPT project includes two stages. The first stage referred to as
AliCPT-1, is to build a telescope in the Ali region of Tibet with an altitude
of 5,250 meters. Once completed, it will be the worldwide highest ground-based
CMB observatory and open a new window for probing PGWs in northern hemisphere.
AliCPT-1 telescope is designed to have about 7,000 TES detectors at 90GHz and
150GHz. The second stage is to have a more sensitive telescope (AliCPT-2) with
the number of detectors more than 20,000.
  Our simulations show that AliCPT will improve the current constraint on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by one order of magnitude with 3 years' observation.
Besides the PGWs, the AliCPT will also enable a precise measurement on the CMB
rotation angle and provide a precise test on the CPT symmetry. We show 3 years'
observation will improve the current limit by two order of magnitude.

spectra are described by quasi-power-like formulas characterised by two

with temperature $T$), the observed log-periodic behaviour of the ratios $R$
can originate either from suitable modifications of $n$ or $T$ (or both, but
such a possibility is not discussed). In the first case $n$ becomes a complex
number and this can be related to scale invariance in the system, in the second

interpreted as the presence of some kind of sound waves forming in the
collision system during the collision process, the wave number of which has a
so-called self similar solution of the second kind. Because the first case was
already widely discussed we concentrate on the second one and on its possible

during biological development and regeneration. A deeper understanding of
biological polarity pattern formation can be gained from the consideration of
pattern reorganisation in response to an opposing instructive cue, which we
here consider by example of experimentally inducible body axis inversions in
planarian flatworms. Our dynamically diluted alignment model represents three
processes: entrainment of cell polarity by a global signal, local cell-cell
coupling aligning polarity among neighbours and cell turnover inserting
initially unpolarised cells. We show that a persistent global orienting signal
determines the final mean polarity orientation in this stochastic model.
Combining numerical and analytical approaches, we find that neighbour coupling
retards polarity pattern reorganisation, whereas cell turnover accelerates it.
We derive a formula for an effective neighbour coupling strength integrating
both effects and find that the time of polarity reorganisation depends linearly
on this effective parameter and no abrupt transitions are observed. This allows
to determine neighbour coupling strengths from experimental observations. Our
model is related to a dynamic $8$-Potts model with annealed site-dilution and
makes testable predictions regarding the polarisation of dynamic systems, such
as the planarian epithelium.

Using numerical solutions of the acoustic and optical wave equations, we
determine the strain distribution of the SAW under resonant excitation. From
the overlap of the acoustic strain field with the optical mode field we
calculate and maximize the attainable amplitude of index modulation in the

shift in relative effective refractive index of 0.7x10$^{-3}$ was obtained for

2.5 - 3.5 $\mu$m, and an IDT voltage of 10 V. For these parameters, the
resonant frequency is in the range 70 - 85 MHz. The maximum shift increases to
1.2x10$^{-3}$, with a corresponding resonant frequency of 87 MHz, when the
height of the cladding above the core is reduced to 3 $\mu$m. The relative
index change is about 300-times higher than in previous work based on

time in an open cavity flow setup. These are found using a novel framework
which permits the computation of such solutions in an arbitrary complex
geometry. The periodic orbits arise from a synchronised concatenation of
convective and acoustic events which strongly depend on the Mach number. This
flow-acoustic interaction furnishes the periodic solutions with a remarkable
stability and it is found to completely dominate the system's dynamics and the
sound directivity. The periodic orbits, which could be called `exact Rossiter
modes', collapse with a family of equilibrium solutions at a subcritical Hopf
bifurcation, occurring in the quasi-incompressible regime. This shows
compressibility has a destabilising effect in cavity flows, which we analyse in
detail. By establishing a connection with previous 2D and 3D stability studies
of cavity flows, we are able to isolate the effect of purely compressible
two-dimensional flow phenomena across Mach number. A linear stability analysis
of the equilibria provides insight into the compressible flow mechanisms
responsible for the instability. A close look at the adjoint modes suggests
that an eigenvalue merge occurs at a Mach number between 0.35 and 0.4, which
boosts the receptivity of the leading mode and determines the onset of the
unstable character of the system. The effect of the choice of base flow over
the transition dynamics is also discussed, where in the present case, the
frequencies associated to the leading eigenmodes show a strong connection with
the frequencies of the periodic orbits at the same Mach numbers.

five-quark in the pentaquark case) intermediate states and the corresponding
cuts. It is shown that some diagrams which ""visually"" seem to contain the
four-quark cuts, turn out to be free of these singularities and therefore
should not be taken into account when calculating the tetraquark properties. We
then consider large-$N_c$ QCD which in many cases provide qualitatively correct
picture of hadron properties and discuss in detail the tetraquark states. For
the ""direct"" and the ""recombination"" four-point Green functions, which may
potentially contain the tetraquark poles, we formulate large-$N_c$ consistency
conditions which strongly restrict the behaviour of the tetraquark-to-ordinary
meson transition amplitudes. In the end, these conditions allow us to obtain
constraints on width of the potential tetraquark states at large $N_c$. We
report that both flavor-exotic and cryptoexotic (i.e., flavor-nonexotic)
tetraquarks, if the corresponding poles exist, have a width of order
$O(1/N_c^2)$, i.e. they should be parametrically narrower compared to the
ordinary $\bar qq$ mesons with a width of order $O(1/N_c)$. Moreover, for
flavor-exotic states, the large-$N_c$ consistency conditions require two narrow
flavor-exotic states, each of these states coupling dominantly to one specific
meson-meson channel.

A recent mathematical breakthrough has clarified their mathematical structure

investigations have found evidence that these constraints are exactly saturated
in several physically relevant systems, e.g., in a certain electronic state of
the Beryllium atom. It has been suggested that in such cases, the constraints,
rather than the details of the Hamiltonian, dictate the system's qualitative
behaviour. Here, we revisit this question with state-of-the-art numerical
methods for small atoms. We find that the constraints are, in fact, not exactly
saturated, but that they lie much closer to the surface defined by the
constraints than the geometry of the problem would suggest. While the results
seem incompatible with the statement that the generalized Pauli constraints
drive the behaviour of these systems, they suggest that the qualitatively
correct wave-function expansions can in some systems already be obtained on the

ramping an applied magnetic field across a resonance. Pairs of open-shell

rotationally supported galaxies lead to curves with different geometries in
$(g_{N},g_{tot})$-space ($g2$-space). Here $g_{tot}$ is the total acceleration
and $g_{N}$ is the acceleration as obtained from the baryonic matter via
Newtonian dynamics. In MOND modified inertia (MI) models the curves in
$g2$-space are closed with zero area and so curve segments at radii $r\geq
r_{N}$ (large radii) and $r< r_{N}$ (small radii) coincide, where $r_{N}$ is
the radius where $g_N$ is greatest. In DM models with cored density profiles
where $g_{tot}$ is also zero at the galactic centre, the curves are again
closed, but the area of the closed curves are in general non-zero because the
curve segments at radii $r\geq r_{N}$ and $r<r_{N}$ do not coincide. Finally in
DM models with cuspy density profiles such as the NFW profile where $g_{tot}$
is formally non-zero at the galactic origin the curves are open, and again the
curve segments at radii $r\geq r_{N}$ and $r< r_{N}$ do not coincide. We
develop a test of whether data at small and large radii coincide and
investigate rotation curves from the SPARC database in order to discriminate
between the above geometries. Due to loosely quantified systematic
uncertainties we do not underline the result of the test, but instead conclude
that the test illustrates the relevance of this type of analysis and
demonstrate the ability to discriminate between the considered DM and MI models

results show that the favorable propagation conditions that aerial users enjoys
due to its altitude is also their strongest limiting factor, as it leaves them

by optimizing the flying altitude, the base station height and antenna

challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

plate is studied. For a plane-strain problem, the governing PDE system is
formulated, which is composed of the mechanical equilibrium equations, the
constraint equation and the boundary conditions. By adopting a gradient growth
field with the growth value changes linearly along the thickness direction, the
exact solution to the governing PDE system can be derived. With the obtained
solution, some important features of the bending deformation in the plate can
be found and the effects of the different growth parameters can be revealed.
This exact solution can serve as a benchmark one for testing the correctness of
numerical schemes and approximate plate models in growth theory.

impurity-interacting (rather than a non-interacting) one. It provides a
rigorous framework for combining wavefunction (or Green function) based methods

self-consistent calculation of the embedded impurity wavefunction has been
performed with the density matrix renormalization group method. It has been

specified for certain tasks in macro-management. 3) Some datasets are either
too small or don't have enough labeled data for modern machine learning

with various features, evaluated on different test sets from the same or
different datasets, making it difficult to be compared directly. To boost the
research of macro-management in StarCraft, we release a new dataset MSC based
on the platform SC2LE. MSC consists of well-designed feature vectors,
pre-defined high-level actions and final result of each match. We also split
MSC into training, validation and test set for the convenience of evaluation

initial baseline results for global state evaluation and build order

of the parameter space of complex deterministic or stochastic models by
matching model outputs with data. It does this via a series of waves where at
each wave an emulator is fitted to a small number of training samples. An
implausibility measure is defined which takes into account the closeness of
simulated and observed outputs as well as emulator uncertainty. As the waves
progress, the emulator becomes more accurate so that training samples are more
concentrated on promising regions of the space and poorer parts of the space
are rejected with more confidence. Whilst history matching has proved to be
useful, existing implementations are not fully automated and some ad-hoc
choices are made during the process, which involves user intervention and is
time consuming. This occurs especially when the non-implausible region becomes
small and it is difficult to sample this space uniformly to generate new
training points. In this article we develop a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
algorithm for implementing history matching that is semi-automated. Our novel
SMC approach reveals that the history matching method yields a non-implausible
region that can be multi-modal, highly irregular and very difficult to sample
uniformly. Our SMC approach offers a much more reliable sampling of the
non-implausible space, which requires additional computation compared to other
approaches used in the literature.

then accretes gas from a protoplanetary disk when the core exceeds a critical
mass. Here, we model the atmosphere of a core that grows by accreting ice-rich
pebbles. The ice fraction of pebbles evaporates in warm regions of the
atmosphere, saturating it with water vapor. Excess water precipitates to lower
altitudes. Beneath an outer radiative region, the atmosphere is convective,
following a moist adiabat in saturated regions due to water condensation and
precipitation. Atmospheric mass, density and temperature increase with core
mass. For nominal model parameters, planets with core masses (ice + rock)
between 0.08 and 0.16 Earth masses have surface temperatures between 273 K and
647 K and form an ocean. In more massive planets, water exists as a
super-critical convecting fluid mixed with gas from the disk. Typically, the
core mass reaches a maximum (the critical mass) as a function of the total mass
when the core is 2-5 Earth masses. The critical mass depends in a complicated
way on pebble size, mass flux, and dust opacity due to the occasional
appearance of multiple core-mass maxima. The core mass for an atmosphere of 50
percent hydrogen and helium may be a more robust indicator of the onset of gas
accretion. This mass is typically 1-3 Earth masses for pebbles that are 50
percent ice by mass, increasing with opacity and pebble flux, and decreasing
with pebble ice/rock ratio.

incorporating variance from the (potentially high-dimensional) treatment model.
We discuss methods for Bayesian propensity score analysis of binary treatments,
focusing on modern methods for high-dimensional Bayesian regression and the
propagation of uncertainty from the treatment regression. We introduce a novel
and simple estimator for the average treatment effect that capitalizes on
conjugancy of the beta and binomial distributions. Through simulations, we show
the utility of horseshoe priors and Bayesian additive regression trees paired

variance from the treatment and outcome models. Cardiac stent data with almost

transformations, the causal order between operations is always preserved.
However, the causal order between a subset of operations can be changed under
continuous yet nonreversible transformations. An explicit example is that of
the quantum switch, where a party in the past affects the causal order of
operations of future parties, leading to a transition from a channel from A to
B, via superposition of causal orders, to a channel from B to A. We generalise
our framework to construct a hierarchy of quantum maps based on transformations

evolutions/operations. Holonomic quantum gates provide us with a robust way
towards universal quantum computation, as these quantum gates are actually
induced by nonabelian geometric phases. Here we propose and elaborate how to
efficiently implement universal nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates on simpler
superconducting circuits, with a single transmon serving as a qubit. In our
proposal, an arbitrary single-qubit holonomic gate can be realized in a
single-loop scenario, by varying the amplitudes and phase difference of two
microwave fields resonantly coupled to a transmon, while nontrivial two-qubit
holonomic gates may be generated with a transmission-line resonator being
simultaneously coupled to the two target transmons in an effective resonant
way. Moreover, our scenario may readily be scaled up to a two-dimensional
lattice configuration, which is able to support large scalable quantum
computation, paving the way for practically implementing universal nonadiabatic
holonomic quantum computation with superconducting circuits.

be described by a thermodynamic Landau-Lifshitz approach. We argue that this
dynamics is triggered as a result of a laser-induced modification of the
exchange interaction. In order to describe the oscillations we have formulated
a quantum mechanical description in terms of magnon pair operators and coherent
states. Such an approach allowed us to} derive an effective macroscopic
equation of motion for the temporal evolution of the antiferromagnetic order

represents a macroscopic entanglement of pairs of magnons with femtosecond
period and nanometer wavelength. By performing magneto-optical pump-probe
experiments with 10 femtosecond resolution in the cubic KNiF$_3$ and the
uniaxial K$_2$NiF$_4$ collinear Heisenberg antiferromagnets, we observed
coherent oscillations at the frequency of 22 THz and 16 THz, respectively. The
detected frequencies as a function of the temperature ideally fit the

promise on facial expression recognition. However, the performance degrades
dramatically under real-world settings due to variations introduced by subtle
facial appearance changes, head pose variations, illumination changes, and

  In this paper, a novel island loss is proposed to enhance the discriminative
power of the deeply learned features. Specifically, the IL is designed to
reduce the intra-class variations while enlarging the inter-class differences
simultaneously. Experimental results on four benchmark expression databases
have demonstrated that the CNN with the proposed island loss (IL-CNN)
outperforms the baseline CNN models with either traditional softmax loss or the

fitting nonthermal (synchrotron) and thermal (free-free) radiation laws. The
underlying radio continuum measurements cover a frequency range of ~325 MHz to
24.5 GHz (32 GHz in case of M82). It turns out that most of these synchrotron
spectra are not simple power-laws, but are best represented by a low-frequency
spectrum with a mean slope alpha_nth = 0.59 +/- 0.20 (S_nu ~ nu^-alpha), and by
a break or an exponential decline in the frequency range of 1 - 12 GHz. Simple
power-laws or mildly curved synchrotron spectra lead to unrealistically low
thermal flux densities, and/or to strong deviations from the expected optically
thin free-free spectra with slope alpha_th = 0.10 in the fits. The break or
cutoff energies are in the range of 1.5 - 7 GeV. We briefly discuss the
possible origin of such a cutoff or break. If the low-frequency spectra
obtained here reflect the injection spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons, they
comply with the mean spectral index of Galactic supernova remnants. A
comparison of the fitted thermal flux densities with the (foreground-corrected)
Halpha fluxes yields the extinction, which increases with metallicity. The
fraction of thermal emission is higher than believed hitherto, especially at
high frequencies, and is highest in the dwarf galaxies of our sample, which we
interpret in terms of a lack of containment in these low-mass systems, or a
time effect caused by a very young starburst.

a 35 year period were used to derive new radial velocities and, coupled with a
spectroscopic disentangling technique, revealed that the A and B components of
GW Ori form a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a $241.50\pm0.05$ day
period; a tertiary companion orbits that inner pair with a $4218\pm50$ day
period. Combining the results from the ALMA data and the optical spectra with
three epochs of astrometry in the literature, we constrain the individual
stellar masses in the system ($M_\mathrm{A} \approx 2.7\,M_\odot$,
$M_\mathrm{B} \approx 1.7\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{C} \approx 0.9\,M_\odot$) and
find strong evidence that at least one (and likely both) stellar orbital planes
are misaligned with the disk plane by as much as $45^\circ$. A $V$-band light
curve spanning 30 years reveals several new $\sim$30 day eclipse events
0.1-0.7~mag in depth and a 0.2 mag sinusoidal oscillation that is clearly
phased with the AB-C orbital period. Taken together, these features suggest
that the A-B pair may be partially obscured by material in the inner disk as
the pair approaches apoastron in the hierarchical orbit. Lastly, we conclude
that stellar evolutionary models are consistent with our measurements of the
masses and basic photospheric properties if the GW Ori system is $\sim$1 Myr
old.

present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models

current mobile web browsers rely on the operating system to exploit the

often leads to poor energy efficiency. This paper describes an automatic
approach to render mobile web workloads for performance and energy efficiency.
It achieves this by developing a machine learning based approach to predict
which processor to use to run the web rendering engine and at what frequencies
the processors should operate. Our predictor learns offline from a set of
training web workloads. The built predictor is then integrated into the browser
to predict the optimal processor configuration at runtime, taking into account
the web workload characteristics and the optimisation goal: whether it is load
time, energy consumption or a trade-off between them. We evaluate our approach
on a representative ARM big.LITTLE mobile architecture using the hottest 500

the Ricci scalar. The solutions obtained by Krori and Barua are used to examine
the nature of particular compact stars with three different modified gravity
models. The behavior of material variables is analyzed through plots and the
physical viability of compact stars is investigated through energy conditions.
We also discuss the behavior of different forces, equation of state parameter,
measure of anisotropy and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in the modeling
of stellar structures. The comparison from our graphical representations may
provide evidences for the realistic and viable $f(R)$ gravity models at both
theoretical and astrophysical scale.

in predicting future economic wealth for financial policy makers of respective
country. Most central banks, on guidelines of research studies, have recently
adopted an inflation targeting monetary policy regime, which accounts for high
requirement for effective prediction model of consumer price index. However,
prediction accuracy by numerous studies is still low, which raises a need for
improvement. This manuscript presents findings of study that use neuro fuzzy
technique to design a machine-learning model that train and test data to
predict a univariate time series CPI. The study establishes a matrix of monthly
CPI data from secondary data source of Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics
from January 2000 to December 2015 as case study and thereafter conducted
simulation experiments on MATLAB whereby ninety five percent (95%) of data used
to train the model and five percent (5%) for testing. Furthermore, the study
use root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as
error metrics for model evaluation. The results show that the neuro fuzzy model
have an architecture of 5:74:1 with Gaussian membership functions (2, 2, 2, 2,
2), provides RMSE of 0.44886 and MAPE 0.23384, which is far better compared to
existing research studies.

  the uniqueness results in the polynomial cases now all relegated to the

with a finite number of sign changes. (Special cases are the Walsh functions.)
By a topological argument, we prove that, given $n$ real-valued functions,
$f_1, \dots, f_n$, in $L^1[0,1]$, there exists a switch function, $\sigma$,
with at most $n$ sign changes that is simultaneously orthogonal to all of them
in the sense that $\int_0^1 \sigma(t)f_i(t)dt=0$, for all $i = 1, \dots , n$.
  Moreover, we prove that, for each $\lambda \in (-1,1)$, there exists a unique
switch function, $\sigma$, with $n$ switches such that $\int_0^1 \sigma(t) p(t)
dt = \lambda \int_0^1 p(t)dt$ for every real polynomial $p$ of degree at most
$n-1$. We also prove the same statement holds for every real even polynomial of
degree at most $2n-2$. Furthermore, for each of these latter results, we write
down, in terms of $\lambda$ and $n$, a degree $n$ polynomial whose roots are
the switch points of $\sigma$; we are thereby able to compute these switch
functions.

daily to persuade, to elicit sympathy, or to convey a message. Computational
understanding of human narratives, especially high-level narrative structures,
remain limited to date. Multiple literary theories for narrative structures
exist, but operationalization of the theories has remained a challenge. We
developed an annotation scheme by consolidating and extending existing
narratological theories, including Labov and Waletsky's (1967) functional
categorization scheme and Freytag's (1863) pyramid of dramatic tension, and
present 360 annotated short stories collected from online sources. In the
future, this research will support an approach that enables systems to
intelligently sustain complex communications with humans.

methodologies to send the data starting from one node then onto the next. The
nodes in the system are non-static and they move arbitrarily and are inclined
to interface disappointment which makes dependably to discover new routes to
the destination. During the forwarding of packets to the destination, various
intermediate nodes take part in routing, where such node should be an ideal
node. An algorithm is proposed here to know the ideal node after studying the
features of the reactive routing protocols. The malicious node can be
eliminated from the networking function and the overhead on the protocol can be
reduced. The node chooses the neighbor which can be found in less number of
bounces and with less time delay and keeping up the QoS.

  the Sectoral Level",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The process of European integration resulted in a marked increase in
transnational economic flows, yet regional inequalities along many
developmental indicators remain. We analyze the unevenness of European
economies with respect to the embedding of export sectors in upstream domestic
flows, and their dependency on dominant export partners. We use the WIOD data
set of sectoral flows for the period of 1995-2011 for 24 European countries. We
found that East European economies were significantly more likely to experience
increasing unevenness and dependency with increasing openness, while core
countries of Europe managed to decrease their unevenness while increasing their
openness. Nevertheless, by analyzing the trajectories of changes for each
country, we see that East European countries are also experiencing a turning
point, either switching to a path similar to the core, or to a retrograde path
with decreasing openness. We analyze our data using pooled time series models
and case studies of country trajectories.
