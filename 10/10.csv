integrated optical devices is of high importance for applications in quantum

dielectric optical single-mode waveguides(Ta2O5 on SiO2). The design of the
waveguide is optimized for broadband (600-800 nm) evanescent coupling to a
single quantum emitter (expected efficiency: up to 36%) and efficient off-chip
coupling to single-mode optical fibers using inverted tapers. First test
samples exhibit propagation losses below 1.8 dB/mm and off-chip coupling
efficiencies exceeding 57%. These results are promising for efficient coupling
of solid state quantum emitters like NV- and SiV-centers to a single optical

distances match those of $G$ up to a multiplicative error $k$. In this paper we
study spanners that are resistant to faults. A subgraph $H \subseteq G$ is an
$f$ vertex fault tolerant (VFT) $k$-spanner if $H \setminus F$ is a $k$-spanner
of $G \setminus F$ for any small set $F$ of $f$ vertices that might ""fail."" One
of the main questions in the area is: what is the minimum size of an $f$ fault
tolerant $k$-spanner that holds for all $n$ node graphs (as a function of $f$,
$k$ and $n$)? This question was first studied in the context of geometric
graphs [Levcopoulos et al. STOC '98, Czumaj and Zhao SoCG '03] and has more
recently been considered in general undirected graphs [Chechik et al. STOC '09,
Dinitz and Krauthgamer PODC '11].
  In this paper, we settle the question of the optimal size of a VFT spanner,
in the setting where the stretch factor $k$ is fixed. Specifically, we prove
that every (undirected, possibly weighted) $n$-node graph $G$ has a
$(2k-1)$-spanner resilient to $f$ vertex faults with $O_k(f^{1 - 1/k} n^{1 +
1/k})$ edges, and this is fully optimal (unless the famous Erdos Girth
Conjecture is false). Our lower bound even generalizes to imply that no data
structure capable of approximating $dist_{G \setminus F}(s, t)$ similarly can
beat the space usage of our spanner in the worst case. We also consider the
edge fault tolerant (EFT) model, defined analogously with edge failures rather
than vertex failures. We show that the same spanner upper bound applies in this
setting. Our data structure lower bound extends to the case $k=2$ (and hence we
close the EFT problem for $3$-approximations), but it falls to $\Omega(f^{1/2 -
1/(2k)} \cdot n^{1 + 1/k})$ for $k \ge 3$. We leave it as an open problem to
close this gap.

of the previously-determined (in part I of this work) high-temperature regions
lead to ignition and comment on their reactive strength and reaction growth
rate. We quantify the sensitisation of nitromethane by the collapse of the
cavity by comparing ignition times of neat and single-cavity material; the
ignition occurs in less than half the ignition time of the neat material. We
compare 2D and 3D simulations to examine the change in topology, temperature

that belated ignition times can be avoided by the use of 3D simulations. The

processes that are responsible for producing magnetic activity in stars and

fields have a significant large-scale component. Aims: Our aim is to
investigate the dynamo properties of compressible convection in a rapidly
rotating Cartesian domain, focusing upon a parameter regime in which the
underlying hydrodynamic flow is known to be unstable to a large-scale vortex
instability. Methods: The governing equations of three-dimensional nonlinear
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are solved numerically. Different numerical schemes
are compared and we propose a possible benchmark case for other similar codes.
Results: In keeping with previous related studies, we find that convection in
this parameter regime can drive a large-scale dynamo. The components of the
mean horizontal magnetic field oscillate, leading to a continuous overall
rotation of the mean field. Whilst the large-scale vortex instability dominates
the early evolution of the system, it is suppressed by the magnetic field and
makes a negligible contribution to the mean electromotive force that is
responsible for driving the large-scale dynamo. The cycle period of the dynamo
is comparable to the ohmic decay time, with longer cycles for dynamos in
convective systems that are closer to onset. In these particular simulations,
large-scale dynamo action is found only when vertical magnetic field boundary
conditions are adopted at the upper and lower boundaries. Strongly modulated
large-scale dynamos are found at higher Rayleigh numbers, with periods of
reduced activity (""grand minima""-like events) occurring during transient phases
in which the large-scale vortex temporarily re-establishes itself, before being
suppressed again by the magnetic field.

broadcast in radio networks. If nodes of the network do not have any labels,
deterministic broadcast is impossible even in the four-cycle. On the other
hand, if all nodes have distinct labels, then broadcast can be carried out,
e.g., in a round-robin fashion, and hence $O(\log n)$-bit labels are sufficient
for this task in $n$-node networks. In fact, $O(\log \Delta)$-bit labels, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree, are enough to broadcast successfully. Hence, it
is natural to ask if very short labels are sufficient for broadcast. Our main
result is a positive answer to this question. We show that every radio network
can be labeled using 2 bits in such a way that broadcast can be accomplished by
some universal deterministic algorithm that does not know the network topology

labels, we get the additional strong property that there exists a common round

operator on the total space of an almost-regular fibration can be written as
the tensor sum of a vertically elliptic family of Dirac operators with the
horizontal Dirac operator, up to an explicit `obstructing' curvature term. We
conclude by showing that the tensor sum factorization represents the interior
Kasparov product in bivariant K-theory.

for Big Data analytics systems, to transfer these large in scale and
distributed data to centralized computational systems for analysis.
Nevertheless, third parties that run and manage these systems (data consumers)
do not always guarantee users' privacy. Their primary interest is to improve
utility that is usually a metric related to the performance, costs and the
quality of service. There are several techniques that mask user-generated data
to ensure privacy, e.g. differential privacy. Setting up a process for masking
data, referred to in this paper as a `privacy setting', decreases on the one
hand the utility of data analytics, while, on the other hand, increases
privacy. This paper studies parameterizations of privacy-settings that regulate
the trade-off between maximum utility, minimum privacy and minimum utility,
maximum privacy, where utility refers to the accuracy in the approximations of
aggregation functions. Privacy settings can be universally applied as
system-wide parameterizations and policies (homogeneous data sharing).
Nonetheless they can also be applied autonomously by each user or decided under
the influence of (monetary) incentives (heterogeneous data sharing). This
latter diversity in data sharing by informational self-determination plays a
key role on the privacy-utility trajectories as shown in this paper both
theoretically and empirically. A generic and novel computational framework is
introduced for measuring privacy-utility trade-offs and their optimization. The
framework computes a broad spectrum of such trade-offs that form
privacy-utility trajectories under homogeneous and heterogeneous data sharing.

of the EWSR to the NEWSR is the centroid or average energy of transition
strengths from an nuclear initial state to all allowed final states. These sum

matrix elements of both operators in a shell model framework (occupation
space), given the input matrix elements for the nuclear Hamiltonian and for the

transition strength functions, with no need to calculate daughter states. We
apply this simple tool to a number of nuclides, and demonstrate the sum rules

compare the electric dipole (E1) sum rule against the famous Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn

compounds. These transitions are of high interest not only for fundamental
physics and chemistry, but also may have important implications for
geochemistry and geophysics of the Earth and planetary interiors. Here we have
carried out a comparative study of the pressure-induced spin transition in
compounds with trivalent iron, octahedrally coordinated by oxygen.
High-pressure single-crystal M\""{o}ssbauer spectroscopy data for FeBO$_3$,
Fe$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_3$(Fe$_{1.766(2)}$Si$_{0.234(2)}$)(SiO$_4$)$_3$ are
presented together with detailed analysis of hyperfine parameter behavior. We
argue that $\zeta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is an intermediate phase in the reconstructive
phase transition between $\iota$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and $\theta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and
question the proposed perovskite-type structure for $\zeta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$.The
structural data show that the spin transition is closely related to the volume
of the iron octahedron. The transition starts when volumes reach 8.9-9.3
\AA$^3$, which corresponds to pressures of 45-60 GPa, depending on the
compound. Based on phenomenological arguments we conclude that the spin
transition can proceed only as a first-order phase transition in
magnetically-ordered compounds. An empirical rule for prediction of cooperative
behavior at the spin transition is proposed. The instability of iron octahedra,
together with strong interactions between them in the vicinity of the critical
volume, may trigger a phase transition in the metastable phase. We find that
the isomer shift of high spin iron ions depends linearly on the octahedron
volume with approximately the same coefficient, independent of the particular
compounds and/or oxidation state. For eight-fold coordinated Fe$^{2+}$ we
observe a significantly weaker nonlinear volume dependence.

We derive analytical expressions for the transmission probability, and the
corresponding conductance, across walls separating different inter-layer

layer asymmetry and that the domain walls have a considerable effect on the
chiral tunnelling properties of the charge carriers. We show that transport
measurements allow one to obtain the strength with which the two layers are

can be explained by the presence of Weyl points near the bottom of the

magnetization, which can nevertheless be detected by optical means (Faraday
rotation of transmitted light) due to the high transparency of the sample. In
agreement with experiment, we find that when infrared light propagates
antiparallel to the current at low doping the current-induced optical rotation
enhances the natural optical rotation. According to our calculations the plane
of polarization rotates in the opposite sense to the bonded atoms in the spiral

  under factoring","33 Pages, No figures",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Newton iteration (NI) is an almost 350 years old recursive formula that
approximates a simple root of a polynomial quite rapidly. We generalize it to a
matrix recurrence (allRootsNI) that approximates all the roots simultaneously.
In this form, the process yields a better circuit complexity in the case when
the number of roots $r$ is small but the multiplicities are exponentially
large. Our method sets up a linear system in $r$ unknowns and iteratively
builds the roots as formal power series. For an algebraic circuit
$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of size $s$ we prove that each factor has size at most a
polynomial in: $s$ and the degree of the squarefree part of $f$. Consequently,
if $f_1$ is a $2^{\Omega(n)}$-hard polynomial then any nonzero multiple
$\prod_{i} f_i^{e_i}$ is equally hard for arbitrary positive $e_i$'s, assuming
that $\sum_i \text{deg}(f_i)$ is at most $2^{O(n)}$.
  It is an old open question whether the class of poly($n$)-sized formulas
(resp. algebraic branching programs) is closed under factoring. We show that
given a polynomial $f$ of degree $n^{O(1)}$ and formula (resp. ABP) size
$n^{O(\log n)}$ we can find a similar size formula (resp. ABP) factor in
randomized poly($n^{\log n}$)-time. Consequently, if determinant requires
$n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size formula, then the same can be said about any of its
nonzero multiples.
  As part of our proofs, we identify a new property of multivariate polynomial
factorization. We show that under a random linear transformation $\tau$,
$f(\tau\overline{x})$ completely factors via power series roots. Moreover, the
factorization adapts well to circuit complexity analysis. This with allRootsNI
are the techniques that help us make progress towards the old open problems,
supplementing the large body of classical results and concepts in algebraic
circuit factorization (eg. Zassenhaus, J.NT 1969, Kaltofen, STOC 1985-7 \&

El Ni\~no describes a state in which sea surface temperatures in the eastern

events typically peak in boreal winter, but their strength varies irregularly
on decadal time scales. There were exceptionally strong El Ni\~no events in

seasonal forcing or noise in this model can induce irregular switching between
an oscillatory state that has strong El Ni\~no events and a chaotic state that

rule: the current polytope can be subdivided by branching on an inequality and
its ""integer negation."" That is, we can (nondeterministically choose) a
hyperplane $ax \geq b$ with integer coefficients, which partitions the polytope
into three pieces: the points in the polytope satisfying $ax \geq b$, the
points satisfying $ax \leq b-1$, and the middle slab $b - 1 < ax < b$. Since
the middle slab contains no integer points it can be safely discarded, and the
algorithm proceeds recursively on the other two branches. Each path terminates
when the current polytope is empty, which is polynomial-time checkable. Among

This allows us to make contact with the experimentally relevant case of
enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling via atomically thin heavy metal
layers. We consider both interfacial spin-orbit coupling induced by inversion
asymmetry in an S/F-junction, as well as in-plane spin-orbit coupling in the

neutrino masses emerge from the type I seesaw mechanism. A full numerical fit
is performed with 15 input parameters generating 19 presently constrained

predicts a normal neutrino mass ordering with a CP oscillation phase of
$260^{\circ}$, an atmospheric angle in the first octant and neutrinoless double

using narrow ($\text{FWHM} < 275 \ \text{km s}^{-1}$) and broad ($\text{FWHM} >
300 \ \text{km s}^{-1}$) Gaussian components for individual galaxies and
stacks. Broad emission is detected at $>3\sigma$ in $<10$% of galaxies and the
broad flux accounts for 10-70% of the total flux. We find a slight increase in
broad to narrow flux ratio with mass but note that we cannot reliably detect
broad emission with $\text{FWHM} < 275 \ \text{km s}^{-1}$, which may be
significant at low masses. Notably, there is a correlation between higher
signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra and a broad component detection indicating a S/N
dependence in our ability to detect broad flux. When placed on the N2-BPT
diagram ([OIII]/H$\beta$ vs. [NII]/H$\alpha$) the broad components of the
stacks are shifted towards higher [OIII]/H$\beta$ and [NII]/$\alpha$ ratios
compared to the narrow component. We compare the location of the broad
components to shock models and find that the broad component could be due to
shocks, but we do not rule out other possibilities such as the presence of an
AGN. We estimate the mass loading factor (mass outflow rate/star formation
rate) assuming the broad component is a photoionized outflow and find that the
mass loading factor increases as a function of mass which agrees with previous
studies. We show that adding emission from shocked gas to $z\sim0$ SDSS spectra
shifts galaxies towards the location of $z\sim2$ galaxies on several emission
line diagnostic diagrams.

long-standing puzzle of how to calculate dipole moments in crystals, but also
lies at the core of the theory of topological band structures in insulators and
superconductors, including the quantum anomalous Hall insulator [3, 4] and the
quantum spin Hall insulator [5-7], as well as quantized adiabatic pumping

existence of topological phases that have not previously been observed. Here we
demonstrate the first member of this predicted class -a quantized quadrupole
topological insulator- experimentally produced using a GHz-frequency
reconfigurable microwave circuit. We confirm the non-trivial topological phase
through both spectroscopic measurements, as well as with the identification of
corner states that are manifested as a result of the bulk topology. We
additionally test a critical prediction that these corner states are protected
by the topology of the bulk, and not due to surface artifacts, by deforming the
edge between the topological and trivial regimes. Our results provide
conclusive evidence of a unique form of robustness which has never previously

($N_H\sim10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) X-ray luminous ($L_X\sim10^{43}$ erg/s) nuclear
sources. We present an analysis of subsequent Chandra, NuSTAR and Swift/XRT
observations that show one source has dropped in flux by a factor of 10 between
2004 and 2011, which could be explained by either an increase in the absorbing
column or an intrinsic fading of the central engine possibly due to a decrease
in mass accretion. Both of these scenarios are predicted by galaxy merger
simulations. The source which has dropped in flux is not detected by NuSTAR,
which argues against absorption, unless it is extreme. However, new Keck/LRIS
optical spectroscopy reveals a previously unreported broad H-alpha line which
is highly unlikely to be visible under the extreme absorption scenario. We
therefore conclude that the black hole in this nucleus has undergone a dramatic
drop in accretion rate. From AO-assisted near-infrared integral-field
spectroscopy of the other nucleus, we find evidence that the galaxy merger is
having a direct effect on the kinematics of the gas close to the nucleus of the
galaxy, providing a direct observational link between the galaxy merger and the
mass accretion rate on to the black hole.

dijets to gain a qualitative understanding of how the shapes of the individual
jets and the asymmetry in the energy of the pairs of jets are modified by
passage through an expanding droplet of strongly coupled plasma, as modeled in
a holographic gauge theory. We do so by constructing an ensemble of strings in
the gravitational description of the gauge theory. We model QCD jets in vacuum
using strings whose endpoints move ""downward"" into the gravitational bulk
spacetime with some fixed small angle that represents the opening angle (ratio
of jet mass to jet energy) that the QCD jet would have in vacuum. Such strings
must be moving through the gravitational bulk at (close to) the speed of light;
they must be (close to) null. This condition does not specify the energy
distribution along the string, meaning that it does not specify the shape of
the jet being modeled. We study the dynamics of strings that are initially not
null and show that strings with a wide range of initial conditions rapidly
accelerate and become null and, as they do, develop a similar distribution of
their energy density. We use this distribution of the energy density along the
string, choose an ensemble of strings whose opening angles and energies are
distributed as in perturbative QCD, and show that we can then fix one model
parameter such that the mean jet shape in our ensemble matches that measured in
p-p collisions reasonably well. We send our strings through the plasma,
choosing the second model parameter to get a reasonable suppression in the
number of jets, and study how the mean jet shape and the dijet asymmetry are
modified, comparing both to data from LHC heavy ion collisions.

through cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave background with galaxy
surveys. We improve with respect to similar previous analyses in several ways.
First, we use the most recent versions of extragalactic object catalogs: SDSS
DR12 photometric redshift (photo-$z$) and 2MASS Photo-$z$ datasets, as well as
employed earlier for ISW, SDSS QSO photo-$z$ and NVSS samples. Second, we use
for the first time the WISE~$\times$~SuperCOSMOS catalog, which allows us to
perform an all-sky analysis of the ISW up to $z\sim0.4$. Third, thanks to the
use of photo-$z$s, we separate each dataset into different redshift bins,
deriving the cross-correlation in each bin. This last step leads to a
significant improvement in sensitivity. We remove cross-correlation between
catalogs using masks which mutually exclude common regions of the sky. We use
two methods to quantify the significance of the ISW effect. In the first one,
we fix the cosmological model, derive linear galaxy biases of the catalogs, and
then evaluate the significance of the ISW using a single parameter. In the
second approach we perform a global fit of the ISW and of the galaxy biases
varying the cosmological model. We find significances of the ISW in the range
4.7-5.0 $\sigma$ thus reaching, for the first time in such an analysis, the
threshold of 5 $\sigma$. Without the redshift tomography we find a significance
of $\sim$ 4.0 $\sigma$, which shows the importance of the binning method.
Finally we use the ISW data to infer constraints on the Dark Energy redshift
evolution and equation of state. We find that the redshift range covered by the
catalogs is still not optimal to derive strong constraints, although this goal
will be likely reached using future datasets such as from Euclid, LSST, and
SKA.

investigate the dependence of planet radius $R_p$ on stellar insolation and
metallicity [Fe/H]. We confirm that for periods $P\lesssim 2$ days, planets
with a radius $R_p\gtrsim 2\,R_\oplus$ are less common than planets with a
radius between 1-2$\,R_\oplus$. We also see a hint of the ""radius valley""
between 1.5 and 2$\,R_\oplus$ that has been seen for close-in planets around
FGK stars. These features in the radius/period distribution could be attributed
to photoevaporation of planetary envelopes by high-energy photons from the host
star, as they have for FGK stars. For the M dwarfs, though, the features are
not as well defined, and we cannot rule out other explanations such as
atmospheric loss from internal planetary heat sources, or truncation of the
protoplanetary disk. There also appears to be a relation between planet size
and metallicity: those few planets larger than about 3 $R_\oplus$ are found
around the most metal-rich M dwarfs.

advantage of data from integral field spectroscopy (IFS). The method fits
equilibrium models to simultaneously reproduce the surface brightness, rotation
and velocity dispersion profiles of a galaxy. The models are fully
self-consistent 6D distribution functions for a galaxy with a Sersic-profile
stellar bulge, exponential disk and parametric dark matter halo, generated by
an updated version of GalactICS. By creating realistic flux-weighted maps of
the kinematic moments (flux, mean velocity and dispersion), we simultaneously
fit photometric and spectroscopic data using both maximum-likelihood and
Bayesian (MCMC) techniques. We apply the method to a GAMA spiral galaxy
(G79635) with kinematics from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and deep $g$- and $r$-band
photometry from the VST-KiDS survey, comparing parameter constraints with those
from traditional 2D bulge-disk decomposition. Our method returns broadly
consistent results for shared parameters, while constraining the mass-to-light
ratios of stellar components and reproducing the HI-inferred circular velocity
well beyond the limits of the SAMI data. While the method is tailored for
fitting integral field kinematic data, it can use other dynamical constraints
like central fibre dispersions and \HI circular velocities, and is well-suited

Over 4,000 models are calculated in the range from 12 to 60 Msun with varying
mass loss rates. The core structure is not greatly affected by the increased
spatial resolution. The qualitative patterns of compactness measures and their
extrema are the same, but with the increased number of models, the scatter seen
in previous studies is replaced by several localized branches. More
physics-based analyses by Ertl et al. (2016) and M$\""u$eller et al. (2016) show
these branches with less scatter than the single parameter characterization of
O'Connor & Ott (2011). These branches are particularly apparent for stars in
the mass ranges 14 - 19 Msun and 22 - 24 Msun. The multi-valued solutions are a
consequence of interference between several carbon and oxygen burning shells
during the late stages of evolution. For a relevant range of masses, whether a
star explodes or not may reflect more the small, almost random differences in
its late evolution than its initial mass. The large number of models allow
statistically meaningful statements about the radius, luminosity, and effective
temperatures of presupernova stars, their core structures, and their remnant
mass distribution.

conventional (Gaussian) fluctuation picture has been applied to address these

In this paper we remedy this omission by computing the diamagnetic

find a large diamagnetic response for a range of temperatures much higher than
the transition temperature. In particular, we report semi-quantitative
agreement with the measured diamagnetic susceptibility onset temperatures, over
the entire range of hole dopings. Notable is the fact that at the lower
critical doping of the superconducting dome, where the transition temperature
vanishes and the pseudogap onset temperature remains large, the onset
temperature for both diamagnetic and transverse thermoelectric transport
coefficients tends to zero. Due to the importance attributed to the cuprate

the extent to which pairing fluctuations are a component of the cuprate

frequently in modern software systems. They appear as serializers and
deserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building
bidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are
intended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to
use a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a
single expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to
program in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a
complex type system.
  To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of
bijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular
expressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for
disambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a
bidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical
challenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough.
Unlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the
context of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of
regular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert
those generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our
synthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language
changes the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one
that admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark
suite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples

demonstration example of a giant impact on a Mars-sized body, using typical
collisional parameters from previous studies. While the material parameters
(equation of state, rheology model) used in the impact simulations can have
some effect on the long-term evolution, we find that the impact angle is the
most crucial parameter for the resulting spatial distribution of the newly
formed crust. The results indicate that a dichotomous crustal pattern can form
after a head-on collision, while this is not the case when considering a more

the accuracy degrades to $\sim20\,\%$, due to inaccurate modelling of the
cosmological and redshift dependence of the splashback radius. For changes in
cosmology allowed by current data, the residuals decrease to $\lesssim2\,\%$ up
to scales twice the virial radius. We illustrate the usefulness of the method
by estimating the mean halo mass of a mock galaxy group sample. We find that

packet scheduling is concentrated in the downlink and the uplink is
comparatively less explored. In up-link, channel aware scheduling with
throughput maximization has been widely studied while considering an infinitely
back-logged buffer model, which makes the investigations unrealistic.
Therefore, we propose an optimal uplink packet scheduling pro-cedure with
realistic traffic sources. Firstly, we advocate a joint channel and buffer
aware algorithm, which maximizes the actual transmitted bit-count. Thereafter,
we introduce delay constraints in our algorithm to support real-time traffic.
We further enhance our algorithm by incorporating the varied delay and
throughput requirements demanded by mixed traffic classes. Finally, we
in-troduce priority flipping to minimize bandwidth starvation of lower priority
traffic in presence of higher percentage of high priority traffic. We observe
that a delay constraint may render the optimization-based proposals infeasible.
Therefore, to avoid infeasibility, we replace the delay constraint with delay
outage minimization (DOM). DOM aims at minimizing the packet drop due to delay
violation. Moreover, DOM also helps in reducing the problems to a well-known
assignment problem, which can be solved by applying the Hungarian algorithm.
Hence, our approach delivers an optimal allocation with low computational
complexity.

observations reveal a compact, ~7 pc, molecular cloud whose mass (10^5 M_sun)
is similar to that of the SSC, consistent with a high star-formation
efficiency, on the order of 0.5. There are two, spatially distinct components
separated by 11 km/s. If expanding, these could be due to momentum-driven,
stellar wind feedback. Alternatively, we may be seeing the remnant infalling,
colliding clouds responsible for triggering the SSC formation. The kinematics
are also consistent with a virialized system. These extreme, high-density,
star-forming conditions inhibit energy-driven feedback; the co-spatial
existence of a massive, molecular cloud with the SSC supports this scenario,
and we quantitatively confirm that any wind-driven feedback in Mrk 71-A is
momentum-driven, rather than energy-driven. Since Mrk 71-A is a candidate Lyman
continuum emitter, this implies that energy-driven superwinds may not be a
necessary condition for the escape of ionizing radiation. In addition, the
detection of the nebular continuum emission yields an accurate astrometric
position for the Mrk 71-A. We also detect four other massive, molecular clouds
in this giant star-forming complex.

Doppler shift as the detector orbits the Sun. This band maximizes the effect
since these are the highest frequencies in which sources live several months.
Atom interferometer detectors can observe in the mid-frequency band, and even
with just a single baseline can exploit this effect for sensitive angular
localization. The single baseline orbits around the Earth and the Sun, causing
it to reorient and change position significantly during the lifetime of the
source, and making it similar to having multiple baselines/detectors. For
example, atomic detectors could predict the location of upcoming black hole or
neutron star merger events with sufficient accuracy to allow optical and other
electromagnetic telescopes to observe these events simultaneously. Thus,
mid-band atomic detectors are complementary to other gravitational wave
detectors and will help complete the observation of a broad range of the

importance in both operator algebras and quantum information is that $\|\Phi

bounded by $\|\Phi \otimes \text{id}_k\|_1 \leq k \|\Phi\|_1$, and matrix
transposition is the canonical example of a map achieving this bound. We prove

the proof relies on a particular characterization of complete trace-norm

  We use this result to characterize the set of single-shot quantum channel

that the game can be won with certainty using entanglement, but is hard to win

a single training process. Although checkpoint ensembles can be applied to any
parametric iterative learning technique, here we focus on neural networks.
Neural networks' composable and simple neurons make it possible to capture many
individual and interaction effects among features. However, small sample sizes
and sampling noise may result in patterns in the training data that are not
representative of the true relationship between the features and the outcome.
As a solution, regularization during training is often used (e.g. dropout).
However, regularization is no panacea -- it does not perfectly address
overfitting. Even with methods like dropout, two methodologies are commonly
used in practice. First is to utilize a validation set independent to the
training set as a way to decide when to stop training. Second is to use
ensemble methods to further reduce overfitting and take advantage of local
optima (i.e. averaging over the predictions of several models). In this paper,
we explore checkpoint ensembles -- a simple technique that combines these two
ideas in one training process. Checkpoint ensembles improve performance by

steps. Instead of modelling them directly, this work introduces a class of
tree-dependent bipartite graphs that span the projective space of decomposable
graphs. This is achieved through dimensionality expansion that causes the graph
nodes to be conditionally independent given a latent tree. The Markov update
steps are thus remarkably simplified. Structural modelling with tree-dependent
bipartite graphs has additional benefits. For example, certain properties that
are hardly attainable in the decomposable form are now easily accessible.
Moreover, tree-dependent bipartite graphs can extract and model extra
information related to sub-clustering dynamics, while currently known models
for decomposable graphs do not. Properties of decomposable graphs are also
transferable to the expanded dimension, such as the attractive likelihood
factorization property. As a result of using the bipartite representation,
tools developed for random graphs can be used. Hence, a framework for random
tree-dependent bipartite graphs, thereupon for random decomposable graphs, is
proposed.

magnetic field free region. In parallel to the progress on the antihydrogen
production, the spectroscopy beamline was tested with a source of hydrogen.

constitues the most precise measurement of the hydrogen hyperfine splitting in
a beam. Further measurements with an upgraded hydrogen apparatus are motivated
by CPT and Lorentz violation tests in the framework of the Standard Model

the difficulty of synthesizing enough cold antiatoms in ground-state. The first
antihydrogen quantum states scan at the entrance of the spectroscopy apparatus

mine all maximal biclusters in mixed-attribute datasets (containing both

proposal is an extension of RIn-Close_CVC, which was originally conceived to
mine perfect or perturbed biclusters with constant values on columns solely
from numerical datasets, and without missing values. Even endowed with
additional and more general features, the extended RIn-Close_CVC retains four
key properties: (1) efficiency, (2) completeness, (3) correctness, and (4)
non-redundancy. Our proposal is the first one to deal with mixed-attribute
datasets without requiring any pre-processing step, such as discretization and
itemization of real-valued attributes. This is a decisive aspect, because
discretization and itemization implies a priori decisions, with information
loss and no clear control over the consequences. On the other hand, even having
to specify a priori an individual threshold for each numerical attribute, that
will be used to indicate internal consistency per attribute, each threshold
will be applied during the construction of the biclusters, shaping the
peculiarities of the data distribution. We also explore the strong connection
between biclustering and frequent pattern mining to (1) provide filters to
select a compact bicluster set that exhibits high relevance and low redundancy,
and (2) in the case of labeled datasets, automatically present the biclusters
in a user-friendly and intuitive form, by means of quantitative class
association rules. Our experimental results showed that the biclusters yield a
parsimonious set of relevant rules, providing useful and interpretable models

methodology is adapted from the information-theoretic method previously

buckling problem with uncertainties in material properties derived from a small
number of experiments using noninformative priors and priors derived from past
studies of varying appropriateness. It is illustrated that prior probabilities
can have a significant impact on multimodel UQ for small datasets and
inappropriate (but seemingly reasonable) priors may even have lingering effects
that bias probabilities even for large datasets. When applied to uncertainty
propagation, this may result in probability bounds on response quantities that
do not include the true probabilities.

coupling within the engine dynamics in the open-loop framework, the closed-loop
engine controller can be designed using a decentralized structure without
significantly affecting the system performance. In the next step, based on a
nonlinear physics-based model of the engine, a set of single-input

between solutions of Painlev\'e equations. Our main contribution is to
establish the algebraic independence of solutions of various pairs of equations
in the Painlev\'e families; for generic coefficients, we show all algebraic
relations between solutions of equations in the same Painlev\'e family come
from classically studied B{\""a}cklund transformations. We also apply our
analysis of ranks to establish some transcendence results for pairs of
Painlev\'e equations from different families. In that area, we answer several
open questions of Nagloo (2016), and in the process answer a question of Boalch
(2012).
  We calculate model theoretic ranks of all Painlev\'e equations in this
article, extending results of Nagloo and Pillay (2017). We show that the type
of the generic solution of any equation in the second Painlev\'e family is
geometrically trivial, extending a result of Nagloo (2015). We give the first
model theoretic analysis of several special families of the third Painlev\'e
equation, proving results analogous to Nagloo and Pillay (2017). We also give a
novel new proof of the irreducibility of the third, fifth and sixth Painlev\'e
equations using recent work of Freitag, Jaoui, and Moosa (2022). Our proof is
fundamentally different than the existing transcendence proofs of Watanabe
(1998) or Cantat and Loray (2009).

the instantons in the worldsheet sigma model which are responsible for the

multi-instanton sector in the WKB approximation which keeps the classical

that the summation of the result over all multi-instanton sectors reproduces
the known amplitude. This suggests that corrections to the WKB limit must
cancel. To show that they indeed cancel, we identify a fermionic symmetry of

that the interaction action is an exact form. These conditions are sufficient
for localization of the worldsheet functional integral onto its WKB limit.

flows in young stellar objects. The bullet-outflow source is associated with a
large pseudo-disk and three molecular outflows -- a high-velocity outflow
(HVO), a medium-velocity outflow (MVO), and a slow, extended outflow (SEO). The
size (mass) of the pseudo-disk is 10,350 AU x 6,400 AU (0.64-0.17 Msun); from a
model-fit assuming infall and rotation we derive a central stellar mass of
8--19 Msun. The HVO (MVO) has an angular size ~5180 (~3330) AU, and a projected
outflow velocity of ~140 km/s (~30 km/s). The SEO size (outflow speed) is ~0.9
pc (~6 km/s). The HVO's axis is aligned with (orthogonal to) that of the SEO
(pseudo-disk). The velocity structure of the MVO is unresolved. The scalar
momenta in the HVO and SEO are very similar, suggesting that the SEO has
resulted from the HVO interacting with ambient cloud material. The bullet spray
shares a common axis with the pseudo-disk, and has an age comparable to that of
MVO (few hundred years), suggesting that these three structures are intimately
linked together. We discuss several models for the outflows in IRAS 05506+2414

becomes singular at some particular temperature higher than the temperature of
the transition to the true non-equilibrium dispersive transport regime. It
means that the diffusion becomes anomalous and does not follow the usual
$\propto t^{1/2}$ law. In such situation the fully developed non-equilibrium
regime emerges in two stages: first, at some temperature there is the
transition from the normal to anomalous diffusion, and then at lower
temperature the average velocity for the infinite medium goes to zero, thus
indicating the development of the true dispersive regime. Validity of the
Einstein relation is discussed for the situation where the diffusivity does

prediction based on z<4.5 DLAs. Thus, we find no significant evidence of a
sudden drop in metallicity at z>4.7 as reported by some prior studies. We also
determine the extent of dust depletion using a combination of both the volatile
element O and the refractory elements Si and/or Fe. Some of the absorbers show
evidence of depletion of elements on dust grains, e.g. low [Si/O] or [Fe/O].
The relative abundances of these absorbers along with other z~5 absorbers from

high [Si/O] in one absorber. Finally, we find that the metallicity vs. velocity

SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) tackles immense

methodology is benchmarked with the quantitative prediction of the ground-state

showcase example of predicting the metal/insulator classification of binaries

For the metal-insulator classification model, the predictive capability are
tested beyond the training data: It rediscovers the available pressure-induced
insulator->metal transitions and it allows for the prediction of yet unknown
transition candidates, ripe for experimental validation. As a step forward with
respect to previous model-identification methods, SISSO can become an effective

distribution due to grain segregation within the vortex. We apply this model to
a numerical simulation of a disk containing a persistent vortex. Due to the
accumulation of large grains towards the vortex center, $\epsilon$ increases by
a factor of 10 from the background disk value, and $p$ decreases from 3.5 to
3.0. We find the disk emission at millimeter wavelengths corresponding to
synthetic observations with ALMA and VLA. The simulated maps at 7 mm and 1 cm
show a strong azimuthal asymmetry. This happens because, at these wavelengths,
the disk becomes optically thin while the vortex remains optically thick. The
large vortex opacity is mainly due to an increase in the dust to gas mass
ratio. In addition, the change in the slope of the dust size distribution
increases the opacity by a factor of 2. We also show that the inclusion of the
dust scattering opacity substantially changes the disks images.

Cadherin is a prominent homotypic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial

with the growth and enlargement of the junctions. In this paper, we propose a
physical model for the structural evolution of cell-cell junctions subjected to
pulling tractions, using the Bell-Dembo-Bongard thermodynamic model. Cadherins
have multiple adhesive states and may establish slip or catch bonds depending
on the Ca 2+ concentration. We conducted a comparative study between the
force-dependent behavior of clusters of slip and catch bonds. The results show
that the clusters of catch bonds feature some hallmarks of cell
mechanotransduction in response to the pulling traction. This is a passive
thermodynamic response and is entirely controlled by the effect of mechanical
work of the pulling force on the free energy landscape of the junction.

difficulties creating physical adversarial stop signs that fool a detector.
More recently, Evtimov et al. produced a physical adversarial stop sign that
fools a proxy model of a detector. In this paper, we show that these physical
adversarial stop signs do not fool two standard detectors (YOLO and Faster
RCNN) in standard configuration. Evtimov et al.'s construction relies on a crop
of the image to the stop sign; this crop is then resized and presented to a
classifier. We argue that the cropping and resizing procedure largely
eliminates the effects of rescaling and of view angle. Whether an adversarial
attack is robust under rescaling and change of view direction remains moot. We
argue that attacking a classifier is very different from attacking a detector,
and that the structure of detectors - which must search for their own bounding
box, and which cannot estimate that box very accurately - likely makes it
difficult to make adversarial patterns. Finally, an adversarial pattern on a
physical object that could fool a detector would have to be adversarial in the
face of a wide family of parametric distortions (scale; view angle; box shift
inside the detector; illumination; and so on). Such a pattern would be of great
theoretical and practical interest. There is currently no evidence that such
patterns exist.

super-Earth-sized exoplanets is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like
Earth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury. Phase curves of the
planets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a
substantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock
surface. Analyzing phase curve photometric data around secondary eclipse has
previously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot
Jupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the
thermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We
utilize a semi-analytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared
photometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters of planetary
properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio
between radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and
atmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by
thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat
redistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective
timescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement
cannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by
currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the
scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat
redistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar. The
Spitzer 4.5-micron band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet
55 Cancri e.

framework for image representation, rather than using it as a post-processing
tool. We formulate the objective function as a constraint optimization problem
and solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Both simulation data and hybrid real data are used to evaluate the
proposed method. Quantification results show that our proposed iterative neural

concurrency for a shared memory model. The approach taken led to a more
abstract algebra of atomic steps, in which atomic steps synchronise (rather
than interleave) when composed in parallel. The algebra of rely/guarantee
concurrency then becomes an instantiation of the more abstract algebra. Many of
the core properties needed for rely/guarantee reasoning can be shown to hold in
the abstract algebra where their proofs are simpler and hence allow a higher
degree of automation. The algebra has been encoded in Isabelle/HOL to provide a
basis for tool support for program verification.
  In rely/guarantee concurrency, programs are specified to guarantee certain
behaviours until assumptions about the behaviour of their environment are
violated. When assumptions are violated, program behaviour is unconstrained
(aborting), and guarantees need no longer hold. To support these guarantees a
second synchronous operator, weak conjunction, was introduced: both processes
in a weak conjunction must agree to take each atomic step, unless one aborts in
which case the whole aborts. In developing the laws for parallel and weak
conjunction we found many properties were shared by the operators and that the
proofs of many laws were essentially the same. This insight led to the idea of
generalising synchronisation to an abstract operator with only the axioms that
are shared by the parallel and weak conjunction operator, so that those two
operators can be viewed as instantiations of the abstract synchronisation
operator. The main differences between parallel and weak conjunction are how
they combine individual atomic steps; that is left open in the axioms for the
abstract operator.

strategy for multi-agent trajectory interpolation. The data-driven priors
implicitly encode the dependencies of movements of multiple agents and the
collision-avoiding desiderata, enabling elimination of costly pairwise
collision constraints and resulting in reduced computational complexity and
often improved estimation. Various combinations of priors and optimization
algorithms are evaluated in comprehensive simulated experiments. Our

of pathway analysis. By applying statistical methods to prior known gene and
protein regulatory information, pathway analysis provides a meaningful way to
interpret genomic data. While many gene/protein regulatory relationships have
been studied, never before has such a significant amount data been made
available in organized forms of gene/protein regulatory networks and pathways.
However, pathway analysis research is still in its infancy, especially when
applying it to solve practical problems.
  In this paper we propose a new method of studying biological pathways, one
that cross analyzes mutation information, transcriptome and proteomics data.
Using this outcome, we identify routes of aberrant pathways potentially
responsible for the etiology of disease. Each pathway route is encoded as a
bayesian network which is initialized with a sequence of conditional
probabilities specifically designed to encode directionality of regulatory
relationships encoded in the pathways. Far more complex interactions, such as
phosphorylation and methylation, among others, in the pathways can be modeled
using this approach. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through its
ability to distinguish real pathways from decoys on TCGA mRNA-seq, mutation,
Copy Number Variation and phosphorylation data for both Breast cancer and
Ovarian cancer study. The majority of pathways distinguished can be confirmed
by biological literature. Moreover, the proportion of correctly indentified
pathways is \% higher than previous work where only mRNA-seq mutation data is
incorporated for breast cancer patients. Consequently, such an in-depth pathway
analysis incorporating more diverse data can give rise to the accuracy of
perturbed pathway detection.

multiplex networks that account for interactions across linked social contexts.
However, little is known about how potential cross-context interference, or
spillover, of individual behavioural strategy impact overall cooperation. We
consider three plausible spillover modes, quantifying and comparing their
effects on the evolution of cooperation. In our model, social interactions take
place on two network layers: one represents repeated interactions with close
neighbours in a lattice, the other represents one-shot interactions with random
individuals across the same population. Spillover can occur during the social
learning process with accidental cross-layer strategy transfer, or during
social interactions with errors in implementation due to contextual
interference. Our analytical results, using extended pair approximation, are in
good agreement with extensive simulations. We find double-edged effects of
spillover on cooperation: increasing the intensity of spillover can promote
cooperation provided cooperation is favoured in one layer, but too much
spillover is detrimental. We also discover a bistability phenomenon of
cooperation: spillover hinders or promotes cooperation depending on initial
frequencies of cooperation in each layer. Furthermore, comparing strategy
combinations that emerge in each spillover mode provides a good indication of
their co-evolutionary dynamics with cooperation. Our results make testable
predictions that inspire future research, and sheds light on human cooperation
across social domains and their interference with one another.

resonance measurements to investigate the magnetic and superconducting (SC)
properties on a ""superconductivity dominant"" ($S$-type) single crystal of
CeCu$_2$Si$_2$. Although the development of antiferromagnetic (AFM)
fluctuations down to 1~K indicated that the AFM criticality was close, Korringa
behavior was observed below 0.8~K, and no magnetic anomaly was observed above
$T_{\rm c} \sim$ 0.6 K. These behaviors were expected in $S$-type
CeCu$_2$Si$_2$. The temperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ at zero field was almost identical to that in the
previous polycrystalline samples down to 130~mK, but the temperature dependence
deviated downward below 120~mK. In fact, $1/T_1$ in the SC state could be
fitted with the two-gap $s_{\pm}$-wave rather than the two-gap $s_{++}$-wave
model down to 90~mK. Under magnetic fields, the spin susceptibility in both
directions clearly decreased below $T_{\rm c}$, indicative of the formation of
spin singlet pairing. The residual part of the spin susceptibility was
understood by the field-induced residual density of states evaluated from
$1/T_1T$, which was ascribed to the effect of the vortex cores. No magnetic
anomaly was observed above the upper critical field $H_{c2}$, but the
development of AFM fluctuations was observed, indicating that superconductivity
was realized in strong AFM fluctuations.

States. Previous modeling studies suggest that direct acting antiviral (DAA)
treatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment is
often delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or
later) due to cost. Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and
medically assisted treatment (MAT) for addiction are known to be less costly,
but have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below current levels. Little
is known about the potential synergistic effects of combining DAA and MAT
treatment, and large-scale tests of combined interventions are rare. While
simulation experiments can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior
simulations have been performed on closed populations of model agents--a
scenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health
agencies. This paper uses data from the Centers for Disease Control's National
HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, IDU round 3, collected in New York City in
2012 by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to
parameterize simulations of open populations. Our results show that, in an open
population, SA/MAT by itself has only small effects on HCV prevalence, while
DAA treatment by itself can significantly lower both HCV and HCV-related
advanced liver disease prevalence. More importantly, the simulation experiments
suggest that cost effective synergistic combinations of the two strategies can
dramatically reduce HCV incidence. We conclude that adopting SA/MAT
implementations alongside DAA interventions can play a critical role in
reducing the long-term consequences of ongoing infection.

often cast high computation and energy cost for energy-constrained applications

enabling effective cost-accuracy trade-off at test time. In our framework, each
data instance is pushed into a cascade of deep neural networks with increasing
sizes, and a selection module is used to sequentially determine when a
sufficiently accurate classifier can be used for this data instance. The
cascade of neural networks and the selection module are jointly trained in an
end-to-end fashion by the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize a trade-off between
the computational cost and the predictive accuracy. Our method is able to
simultaneously improve the accuracy and efficiency by learning to assign easy
instances to fast yet sufficiently accurate classifiers to save computation and
energy cost, while assigning harder instances to deeper and more powerful
classifiers to ensure satisfiable accuracy. With extensive experiments on
several image classification datasets using cascaded ResNet classifiers, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms the standard well-trained ResNets in

in 2-10 keV), and then gradually faded in $\sim$10 days by more than one order
of magnitude. Time-averaged Swift/XRT spectra in the decaying phase can be
described by a blackbody with a relatively low temperature (0.1-0.5 keV), plus
a hard power-law component with a photon index of $\sim$2. These spectral
properties are similar to those of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)

detected in the optical wavelength on March 27-31 as well. The optical flux
decreased monotonically as the X-ray flux decayed. The correlation between the

a prospect of discovering the heavy Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) from
a resonant production of a new massive gauge boson ($Z^{\prime}$) and its
subsequent decay into a pair of RHNs ($Z^{\prime}\to NN$) at the future LHC.
Recent simulation studies have shown that the discovery of the RHNs through
this process is promising in the future. However, the current LHC data very
severely constrains the production cross section of the $Z^{\prime}$ boson into
a dilepton final states, $pp \to Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-} $ ($\ell=e$ or
$\mu$). Extrapolating the current bound to the future, we find that a
significant enhancement of the branching ratio ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN$)
over ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$) is necessary for the future
discovery of RHNs. As a well-motivated simple extension of the Standard Model
(SM) to incorporate the $Z^\prime$ boson and the type-I seesaw mechanism, we
consider the minimal U(1)$_X$ model. We point out that this model can yield a
significant enhancement up to ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN)/{\rm
BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}) \simeq 5$ (per generation). This is in
sharp contrast with the minimal $B-L$ model, a benchmark scenario commonly used
in simulation studies, which predicts ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN)/{\rm
BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}) \simeq 0.5$ (per generation). With such an
enhancement and a realistic model-parameter choice to reproduce the neutrino
oscillation data, we conclude that the possibility of discovering RHNs with a
$300 \; {\rm fb}^{-1}$ luminosity implies that the $Z^\prime$ boson will be
discovered with a luminosity of $170.5 \;{\rm fb}^{-1}$ ($125 \; {\rm
fb}^{-1}$) for the normal (inverted) hierarchy of the light neutrino mass
pattern.

determined by the spectral properties of the elliptic operator

periodic ($\Lambda_h$ denotes the equilateral triangular lattice), and such

stability and instability of Dirac points, conical intersections between two
adjacent Floquet-Bloch dispersion surfaces. We then show that the introduction
through small and slow variations of a {\it domain wall} across a line-defect
gives rise to the bifurcation from Dirac points of highly robust (topologically
protected) {\it edge states}. These are time-harmonic solutions of Maxwell's
equations which are propagating parallel to the line-defect and spatially
localized transverse to it.
  The transverse localization and strong robustness to perturbation of these
edge states is rooted in the protected zero mode of a one-dimensional effective
Dirac operator with spatially varying mass term. These results imply the
existence of {\it uni-directional} propagating edge states for two classes of
time-reversal invariant media in which $\mathcal{C}$ symmetry is broken:
magneto-optic media and bi-anisotropic media. Our analysis applies and extends

to determine the causal status of factors that are neither individually
necessary nor individually sufficient to produce that event. In order to reason
about how such factors should be taken into account, we need a vocabulary to
distinguish different cases. In philosophy, the concept of overdetermination
and the concept of preemption serve an important purpose in this regard,
although their exact meaning tends to remain elusive. In this paper, I provide
theory-neutral definitions of these concepts using structural equations in the
Halpern-Pearl tradition. While my definitions do not presuppose any particular
causal theory, they take such a theory as a variable parameter. This enables us
to specify formal constraints on theories of causality, in terms of a
pre-theoretic understanding of what preemption and overdetermination actually
mean. I demonstrate the usefulness of this by presenting and arguing for what I
call the principle of presumption. Roughly speaking, this principle states that
a possible cause can only be regarded as having been preempted if there is
independent evidence to support such an inference. I conclude by showing that
the principle of presumption is violated by the two main theories of causality
formulated in the Halpern-Pearl tradition. The paper concludes by defining the
class of empirical causal theories, characterised in terms of a fixed-point of
counterfactual reasoning about difference-making. It is argued that theories of
actual causality ought to be empirical.

when reasoning about the causal factors during hazard analysis. Such
uncertainty is common when complicated systems interact with one another, and
it is dangerous because it impairs hazard analysis and thus increases the
chance of overlooking unsafe situations. Uncertainty around causation thus
needs to be managed well. Unfortunately, existing hazard analysis techniques
tend to ignore unknown uncertainties, and system stakeholders rarely track
known uncertainties well through the system lifecycle. In this paper, we
outline an approach to managing epistemic uncertainty in existing hazard
analysis techniques by focusing on known and unknown uncertainty. We have
created a reference populated with a wide range of safety-critical causal
relationships to recognise unknown uncertainty, and we have developed a model
to systematically capture and track known uncertainty around such factors. We
have also defined a process for using the reference and model to assess
possible causal factors that are suspected during hazard analysis. To assess
the applicability of our approach, we have analysed the widely-used MoDAF
architectural model and determined that there is potential for our approach to
identify additional causal factors that are not apparent from individual MoDAF
views. We have also reviewed an existing safety assessment example (the ARP4761
Aircraft System analysis) and determined that our approach could indeed be
incorporated into that process. We have also integrated our approach into the
STPA hazard analysis technique to demonstrate its feasibility to incorporate
into existing techniques. It is therefore plausible that our approach can
increase safety assurance provided by hazard analysis in the face of epistemic
uncertainty.

set $D$ (called a dictionary) on a text $T$. The Aho-Corasick-automaton
(AC-automaton) is a data structure which enables us to solve the dictionary
matching problem in $O(d\log\sigma)$ preprocessing time and
$O(n\log\sigma+occ)$ matching time, where $d$ is the total length of the
patterns in $D$, $n$ is the length of the text, $\sigma$ is the alphabet size,
and $occ$ is the total number of occurrences of all the patterns in the text.
The dynamic dictionary matching is a variant where patterns may dynamically be
inserted into and deleted from $D$. This problem is called semi-dynamic
dictionary matching if only insertions are allowed. In this paper, we propose
two efficient algorithms. For a pattern of length $m$, our first algorithm
supports insertions in $O(m\log\sigma+\log d/\log\log d)$ time and pattern
matching in $O(n\log\sigma+occ)$ time for the semi-dynamic setting and supports
both insertions and deletions in $O(\sigma m+\log d/\log\log d)$ time and
pattern matching in $O(n(\log d/\log\log d+\log\sigma)+occ(\log d/\log\log d))$
time for the dynamic setting by some modifications. This algorithm is based on
the directed acyclic word graph. Our second algorithm, which is based on the
AC-automaton, supports insertions in $O(m\log \sigma+u_f+u_o)$ time for the
semi-dynamic setting and supports both insertions and deletions in $O(\sigma
m+u_f+u_o)$ time for the dynamic setting, where $u_f$ and $u_o$ respectively
denote the numbers of states in which the failure function and the output
function need to be updated. This algorithm performs pattern matching in
$O(n\log\sigma+occ)$ time for both settings. Our algorithm achieves optimal
update time for AC-automaton based methods over constant-size alphabets, since
any algorithm which explicitly maintains the AC-automaton requires
$\Omega(m+u_f+u_o)$ update time.

tool to localize, characterize, and evaluate anomalous prostate tissue.
Ultrafast gradient-echo acquisitions of MRI volumes are generated at regular
time intervals while the patient receives a paramagnetic contrast agent. The
result is a time series where each voxel exhibits a particular behavior of
contrast uptake (wash-in) and posterior wash-out. In this work, a segmentation
method is proposed that groups together neighboring voxels with similar
contrast wash-out responses, using a variant of the region growing GrowCut
cellular automaton algorithm, that evolves iteratively according to the
relationship of a cell to its neighboring cells. Initially, seed cells are
determined through morphological filters that identify homogeneous regions in
the volume that are representatives of the clinically relevant types of tissues
in the prostate. Each cell is characterized by three parameters: a label that
identifies the type of tissue in the associated voxel, a vector with the values
of the DCE-MRI time series, and a strength coefficient with values between 0
and 1 that represents the probability with which the cell belongs to its
assigned label. Every non-seed cell can modify its state; this occurs when each
cell is attacked by its neighbors with a strength of attack that is inversely
proportional to the similarity of the values of the time series between the
cells. If the strength of the attacked cell is less than the strength of the
attack of one of its neighbors, its state changes to the one of the attacking
cell. The attacked cell also updates its strength making it equal to the
strength of the attack with which it was conquered. To perform a clinical
validation of the resulting segmentations, we used various cases from the
database of The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), National Cancer Institute (NCI).

collimated SiO jet shows point-symmetric oscillation patterns in both position
and velocity, which suggests that the jet axis is precessing and the driving
source may belong to a non-coplanar binary system. By considering the position
and velocity variabilities together, accurate jet parameters were derived. The
protostellar system is viewed nearly edge-on, and the jet has a flow speed of
35 km/s and a precession period of 1600 years. The CO outflow length gives a
dynamical timescale of 6300 years, and the protostar must be extremely young.
The inferred binary separation of 6-70 au implies that this protobinary system
may have been formed through the disk instability process. The continuum
spectra of L1641 dense cores indicate that the emission comes from dust, and
the fits with modified blackbody functions give emissivity power indices of
beta = 0.3-2.2. The emissivity index shows a positive correlation with the
molecular line width, but no strong correlation with bolometric luminosity or
temperature. V380 Ori NE has a particularly low value of beta = 0.3, which
tentatively suggests the presence of millimeter-sized dust grains. Because the
dust growth takes millions of years, much longer than the protostellar age,
this core may have produced large grains in the starless core stage. HH 34 MMS
and HH 147 MMS also have low emissivity indices.

operations of internet companies. Generically, the idea is to perform a
statistical test of the hypothesis that a new feature is better than the
existing platform---for example, it results in higher revenue. If the p value
for the test is below some pre-defined threshold---often, 0.05---the new
feature is implemented. The difficulty of choosing an appropriate threshold has
been noted before, particularly because dependent tests are often done
sequentially, leading some to propose control of the false discovery rate (FDR)
rather than use of a single, universal threshold. However, it is still
necessary to make an arbitrary choice of the level at which to control FDR.
Here we suggest a decision-theoretic approach to determining whether to adopt a
new feature, which enables automated selection of an appropriate threshold. Our
method has the basic ingredients of any decision-theory problem: a loss
function, action space, and a notion of optimality, for which we choose Bayes
risk. However, the loss function and the action space differ from the typical
choices made in the literature, which has focused on the theory of point
estimation. We give some basic results for Bayes-optimal thresholding rules for
the feature adoption decision, and give some examples using eBay data. The
results suggest that the 0.05 p-value threshold may be too conservative in some
settings, but that its widespread use may reflect an ad-hoc means of
controlling multiplicity in the common case of repeatedly testing variants of
an experiment when the threshold is not reached.

arising from photoionized gas moving in the gravitational potential of a

so far, however. Another component is the dusty torus beyond the broad-line
region, likely an assembly of discrete clumps that can hide the region from
some viewing angles and make them observationally appear as Type 2 objects.
Here we report that these clumps moving within the dust sublimation radius,
like the molecular cloud G2 discovered in the Galactic center, will be tidally
disrupted by the hole, resulting in some gas becoming bound at smaller radii
while other gas is ejected and returns to the torus. The clumps fulfill
necessary conditions to be photoionized. Specific dynamical components of
tidally disrupted clumps include spiral-in gas as inflow, circularized gas, and
ejecta as outflow. We calculate various profiles of emission lines from these
clouds, and find they generally agree with H$\beta$ profiles of Palomar-Green
quasars. We find that asymmetry, shape and shift of the profiles strongly
depend on [O III], luminosity, which we interpret as a proxy of dusty torus
angles. Tidally disrupted clumps from the torus may represent the source of the

experiments to exhibit behavior in the semiclassical limit that qualitatively
resembles that of its one-dimensional reduction, the defocusing nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation, namely the generation from smooth initial data of
regular rapid oscillations occupying domains of space-time that become
well-defined in the limit. As a first step to study this problem analytically
using the inverse-scattering transform, we consider the direct spectral
transform for the defocusing Davey-Stewartson II equation for smooth initial
data in the semiclassical limit. The direct spectral transform involves a
singularly-perturbed elliptic Dirac system in two dimensions. We introduce a
WKB-type method for this problem, prove that it makes sense formally for
sufficiently large values of the spectral parameter $k$ by controlling the
solution of an associated nonlinear eikonal problem, and we give numerical
evidence that the method is accurate for such $k$ in the semiclassical limit.
Producing this evidence requires both the numerical solution of the
singularly-perturbed Dirac system and the numerical solution of the eikonal
problem. The former is carried out using a method previously developed by two
of the authors and we give in this paper a new method for the numerical
solution of the eikonal problem valid for sufficiently large $k$. For a
particular potential we are able to solve the eikonal problem in closed form
for all $k$, a calculation that yields some insight into the failure of the WKB
method for smaller values of $k$. Informed by numerical calculations of the
direct spectral transform we then begin a study of the singularly-perturbed
Dirac system for values of $k$ so small that there is no global solution of the
eikonal problem.

adiabatic master equation in Lindblad form. By evolving a complex state vector
of dimension $N$ instead of a complex density matrix of dimension $N^2$,
simulations of larger system sizes become feasible. The cost of running many
trajectories, which is required to recover the master equation evolution, can
be minimized by running the trajectories in parallel, making this method
suitable for high performance computing clusters. In general, the trajectories
method can provide up to a factor $N$ advantage over directly solving the
master equation. In special cases where only the expectation values of certain
observables are desired, an advantage of up to a factor $N^2$ is possible. We
test the method by demonstrating agreement with direct solution of the quantum
adiabatic master equation for $8$-qubit quantum annealing examples. We also
apply the quantum trajectories method to a $16$-qubit example originally
introduced to demonstrate the role of tunneling in quantum annealing, which is
significantly more time consuming to solve directly using the master equation.
The quantum trajectories method provides insight into individual quantum jump
trajectories and their statistics, thus shedding light on open system quantum
adiabatic evolution beyond the master equation.

locating the critical points of the gravitational potential energy congruent
with some fixed surface metric. This is because, if the walls are thin, the
lowest energy modes of deformation are strain-free, and thus described by
surface isometries. If it is to stand, however, an arch had better possess some
minimum rigidity. The bending energy consistent with this construction
protocol, we will show, can only depend on curvature deviations away from the
reference equilibrium form. The question of stability, like the determination
of equilibrium, turns on the geometry. We show how to construct the
self-adjoint operator controlling the response to deformations consistent with
isometry. As illustration, we reassess the stability of a simple catenary arch
in terms of the behavior of the ground state of this operator. The energy of
this state increases monotonically with the bending rigidity and it is possible
to identify the critical rigidity above which the arch is rendered stable.
While this dependence may be monotonic, it exhibits a number of subcritical
kinks indicating significant qualitative changes in the ground state associated
with eigenvalue crossovers among the unstable modes in the spectrum; the number
of such competing modes increasing rapidly as the rigidity is lowered. The
initial collapse of a subcritical arch is controlled by the ground state; on
the critical threshold, there are two unstable modes of equal energy, one
raising the arch at its center, the other lowering it. The latter dominates as
the instability grows. The qualitative behavior of the ground state changes as
the rigidity is lowered---its nodal pattern as well as its parity undergoing
abrupt changes as the intervals between crossovers converge---complicating the
prediction of the dominant initial mode of collapse.

metabolites. In scenarios wherein the number of assayed metabolites increases,
as in the application of nontargeted versus targeted metabolomics measures,
multivariate methods performed especially favorably across a range of
statistical operating characteristics. In nontargeted metabolomics datasets
that included thousands of metabolite measures, sparse multivariate models
demonstrated greater selectivity and lower potential for spurious
relationships. Conclusion. When the number of metabolites was similar to or
exceeded the number of study subjects, as is common with nontargeted
metabolomics analysis of relatively small sized cohorts, sparse multivariate
models exhibited the most robust statistical power with more consistent
results. These findings have important implications for the analysis of
metabolomics studies of human disease.

(2013) and Dominick et al. (2013) is extended to a general multivariate
framework (MMSQ) and to provide a sparse estimator of the scale matrix
(sparse-MMSQ). The MSQ, like alternative likelihood-free procedures, is based
on the minimisation of the distance between appropriate statistics evaluated on
the true and synthetic data simulated from the postulated model. Those
statistics are functions of the quantiles providing an effective way to deal
with distributions that do not admit moments of any order like the
$\alpha$-Stable or the Tukey lambda distribution. The lack of a natural
ordering represents the major challenge for the extension of the method to the
multivariate framework. Here, we rely on the notion of projectional quantile
recently introduced by Hallin etal. (2010) and Kong Mizera (2012). We establish
consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. The smoothly
clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) $\ell_1$--penalty of Fan and Li (2001) is
then introduced into the MMSQ objective function in order to achieve sparse
estimation of the scaling matrix which is the major responsible for the curse
of dimensionality problem. We extend the asymptotic theory and we show that the
sparse-MMSQ estimator enjoys the oracle properties under mild regularity
conditions. The method is illustrated and its effectiveness is tested using
several synthetic datasets simulated from the Elliptical Stable distribution
(ESD) for which alternative methods are recognised to perform poorly. The
method is then applied to build a new network-based systemic risk measurement
framework. The proposed methodology to build the network relies on a new
systemic risk measure and on a parametric test of statistical dominance.

frozen volatiles. In a sub-set of the asteroids called main-belt comets (MBCs),
the sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient comet-like activity
[6-8]. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin rates of
active comets [9] and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei
[10]. The kilometer-sized main-belt asteroid 288P (300163) showed activity for
several months around its perihelion 2011 [11], suspected to be sustained by
the sublimation of water ice [12] and supported by rapid rotation [13], while
at least one component rotates slowly with a period of 16 hours [14]. 288P is
part of a young family of at least 11 asteroids that formed from a ~10km
diameter precursor during a shattering collision 7.5 million years ago [15].
Here we report that 288P is a binary main-belt comet. It is different from the
known asteroid binaries for its combination of wide separation, near-equal
component size, high eccentricity, and comet-like activity. The observations
also provide strong support for sublimation as the driver of activity in 288P

Enzymatic activity
can induce broken detailed balance at the molecular scale. This molecular scale
breaking of detailed balance is crucial to achieve biological functions such as
high-fidelity transcription and translation, sensing, adaptation, biochemical
patterning, and force generation. While biological systems such as motor
enzymes violate detailed balance at the molecular scale, it remains unclear how
non-equilibrium dynamics manifests at the mesoscale in systems that are driven
through the collective activity of many motors. Indeed, in several cellular
systems the presence of non-equilibrium dynamics is not always evident at large
scales. For example, in the cytoskeleton or in chromosomes one can observe
stationary stochastic processes that appear at first glance thermally driven.
This raises the question how non-equilibrium fluctuations can be discerned from
thermal noise. We discuss approaches that have recently been developed to
address this question, including methods based on measuring the extent to which
the system violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we
discuss a more recent approach to detect actively driven dynamics, which is
based on inferring broken detailed balance. This constitutes a non-invasive
method that uses time-lapse microscopy data, and can be applied to a broad
range of systems in cells and tissue. We discuss the ideas underlying this
method and its application to several examples including flagella, primary

dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Fast electrons generated from the

time-oscillating charge and current densities at the target backside. Periodic
decreases in the electron density lead to transient disruptions of the TNSA

in energy from a modified potential driven by further electron recirculation.

dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of
equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying
such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two
different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing
(HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of
the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information
is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure)
represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In
contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure
holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of
the whole set of particles.
  The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and
flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance
of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our
particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon
processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the
AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor
of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and
multi-purpose GPUs.
  Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has
optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same
handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such
template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user

source domain performs poorly when applied to a target domain with different
statistics. {Domain Generalization} (DG) techniques attempt to alleviate this
issue by producing models which by design generalize well to novel testing
domains. We propose a novel {meta-learning} method for domain generalization.
Rather than designing a specific model that is robust to domain shift as in
most previous DG work, we propose a model agnostic training procedure for DG.
Our algorithm simulates train/test domain shift during training by synthesizing
virtual testing domains within each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective
requires that steps to improve training domain performance should also improve
testing domain performance. This meta-learning procedure trains models with
good generalization ability to novel domains. We evaluate our method and
achieve state of the art results on a recent cross-domain image classification
benchmark, as well demonstrating its potential on two classic reinforcement
learning tasks.

powerful active galactic nuclei, we expect this to be a reliable SFR indicator

shows more scatter (1-$\sigma =$ 0.18 dex). Both relations show reasonable
agreement with radio continuum-derived SFRs and excellent accordance with
so-called ""hybrid"" H$\alpha + 24 \mu$m and FUV$+$24$\mu$m indicators. Moreover,
the $WISE$ SFR relations appear to be insensitive to the metallicity range in
the sample. We also compare our results with IRAS-selected luminous infrared

systematically deviate for the most extreme galaxies. Given the all-sky

an $n\times n$ matrix variable into up to $n$ smaller matrix variables, each
representing a principal submatrix of up to $\omega\times\omega$. Its
fundamental weakness is the need to introduce overlap constraints that enforce
agreement between different matrix variables, because these can result in dense
coupling. In this paper, we show that by dualizing the clique tree conversion,
the coupling due to the overlap constraints is guaranteed to be sparse over
dense blocks, with a block sparsity pattern that coincides with the adjacency
matrix of a tree. We consider two classes of semidefinite programs with
favorable sparsity patterns that encompass the MAXCUT and MAX $k$-CUT
relaxations, the Lovasz Theta problem, and the AC optimal power flow
relaxation. Assuming that $\omega\ll n$, we prove that the per-iteration cost
of an interior-point method is linear $O(n)$ time and memory, so an
$\epsilon$-accurate and $\epsilon$-feasible iterate is obtained after
$O(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations in near-linear
$O(n^{1.5}\log(1/\epsilon))$ time. We confirm our theoretical insights with

formation rates, and colours of both the inner `bulge' and outer `disc'
components for these systems using SED information from the resolved ACS+WFC3
HST imaging. We find that the majority of both inner and outer components lie
in the star-forming region of UVJ space ($68$ and $90$ per cent respectively).
However, the inner portions, or the likely forming bulges, are dominated by
dusty star formation. Furthermore, we show that the outer components of these
systems have a higher star formation rate than their inner regions, and the
ratio of star formation rate between `disc' and `bulge' increases at lower
redshifts. Despite the higher star formation rate of the outer component, the
stellar mass ratio of inner to outer component remains constant through this
epoch. This suggests that there is mass transfer from the outer to inner
components for typical two component forming systems, thus building bulges from
disks. Finally, using Chandra data we find that the presence of an AGN is more
common in both $1$-component spheroid-like galaxies and $2$-component systems

generation of entangled photon pairs. Among the other techniques, droplet
epitaxy enables the control of the shape, size, density, and emission
wavelength of the quantum emitters. However, the fraction of the
entanglement-ready quantum dots that can be fabricated with this method is
still limited to around 5%, and matching the energy of the entangled photons to
atomic transitions (a promising route towards quantum networking) remains an
outstanding challenge.
  Here, we overcome these obstacles by introducing a modified approach to
droplet epitaxy on a high symmetry (111)A substrate, where the fundamental
crystallization step is performed at a significantly higher temperature as
compared to previous reports. Our method drastically improves the yield of
entanglement-ready photon sources near the emission wavelength of interest,
which can be as high as 95% due to the low values of fine structure splitting
and radiative lifetime, together with the reduced exciton dephasing offered by
the choice of GaAs/AlGaAs materials. The quantum dots are designed to emit in
the operating spectral region of Rb-based slow-light media, providing a viable
technology for quantum repeater stations.

by randomly dropping out units through Bernoulli multiplicative noise, and for
some restricted problem classes, such as linear or logistic regression, several
theoretical studies have demonstrated the equivalence between dropout and a
fully deterministic optimization problem with data-dependent Tikhonov
regularization. This work presents a theoretical analysis of dropout for matrix
factorization, where Bernoulli random variables are used to drop a factor,
thereby attempting to control the size of the factorization. While recent work
has demonstrated the empirical effectiveness of dropout for matrix
factorization, a theoretical understanding of the regularization properties of
dropout in this context remains elusive. This work demonstrates the equivalence
between dropout and a fully deterministic model for matrix factorization in
which the factors are regularized by the sum of the product of the norms of the
columns. While the resulting regularizer is closely related to a variational
form of the nuclear norm, suggesting that dropout may limit the size of the
factorization, we show that it is possible to trivially lower the objective
value by doubling the size of the factorization. We show that this problem is
caused by the use of a fixed dropout rate, which motivates the use of a rate
that increases with the size of the factorization. Synthetic experiments
validate our theoretical findings.

global holomorphic functions on $X$ (inside its total ring of fractions) with
respect to the usual Fr\'echet topology of $\overline{{\mathcal O}(X)}^\nu$.
This shows that not only the Stein space $(X,{\mathcal O}_X)$ but also its
normalization is completely determined by the ring ${\mathcal O}(X)$ of global
analytic functions on $X$. This result was already proved in 1988 by
Hayes-Pourcin when $(X,{\mathcal O}_X)$ is an irreducible Stein space whereas

A
motor efficient in cargo transport would move along cytoskeletal filaments with
a high speed and a minimal error in transport distance (or time) while
consuming a minimal amount of energy. The travel distance of the motor and its
variance are, however, physically constrained by the free energy being
consumed. A recently formulated \emph{thermodynamic uncertainty relation}
offers a theoretical framework for the energy-accuracy trade-off relation
ubiquitous in biological processes. According to the relation, a measure
$\mathcal{Q}$, the product between the heat dissipated from a motor and the
squared relative error in the displacement, has a minimal theoretical bound
($\mathcal{Q} \geq 2 k_B T$), which is approached when the time trajectory of
the motor is maximally regular for a given amount of free energy input. Here,
we use $\mathcal{Q}$ to quantify the transport efficiency of biological motors.
Analyses on the motility data from several types of molecular motors reveal
that $\mathcal{Q}$ is a complex function of ATP concentration and load ($f$).
For kinesin-1, $\mathcal{Q}$ approaches the theoretical bound at $f\approx 4$
pN and over a broad range of ATP concentration (1 $\mu$M - 10 mM), and is
locally minimized at [ATP] $\approx$ 200 $\mu$M. In stark contrast, this local
minimum vanishes for a mutant that has a longer neck-linker, and the value of
$\mathcal{Q}$ is significantly greater, which underscores the importance of
molecular structure. Transport efficiencies of the biological motors studied
here are semi-optimized under the cellular condition ([ATP] $\approx 1$ mM,
$f=0-1$ pN). Our study indicates that among many possible directions of
optimization, cytoskeletal motors are designed to operate at a high speed with
a minimal error while leveraging their energy resources.

which occurs at a concentration-dependent value of the forcing. We further show
that this response is associated with a nonequilibrium transition between a
`hard' (or less deformable) phase, which is nearly jammed and flows very
slowly, and a `soft' (or more deformable) phase, which flows much more easily.
The soft phase is characterised by flow-induced time dependent shape
deformations and internal currents, which are virtually absent in the hard

and density fluctuations can produce a broadening of the injected beam, as
confirmed in experiment and simulation. Increased power deposition width could
impact suppression of tearing mode structures on ITER. This work discusses the
experimental portion of an effort to understand scattering of injected
microwaves by turbulence on the DIII-D tokamak. The corresponding theoretical
modeling work can be found in M.B. Thomas et. al.: Submitted to Nuclear Fusion
(2017)[Author Note - this paper to be published in same journal]. In a set of
perturbative heat transport experiments, tokamak edge millimeter-scale
fluctuation levels and microwave heat deposition are measured simultaneously.
Beam broadening is separated from heat transport through fitting of modulated
fluxes. Electron temperature measurements from a 500 kHz, 48-channel ECE
radiometer are Fourier analyzed and used to calculate a deposition-dependent
flux. Consistency of this flux with a transport model is evaluated. A diffusive
and convective transport solution is linearized and compared with energy
conservation-derived fluxes. Comparison between these two forms of heat flux is
used to evaluate the quality of ECRF deposition profiles, and fitting finds a
significant broadening of 1D equilibrium ray tracing calculations from the
benchmarked TORAY-GA ray tracing code is needed. The physical basis,
cross-validation, and application of the heat flux method is presented. The
method is applied to a range of DIII-D discharges and finds a broadening factor
of the deposition profile width which scales linearly with edge density
fluctuation level. These experimental results are found to be consistent with
the full-wave beam broadening measured by the 3D full wave simulations in the
same discharges.

However, the performance of these devices is drastically limited by aberrations
(in phase or in amplitude, introduced either by atmosphere or by the optics).
Coronagraphs must therefore be combined with extreme adaptive optic systems,
composed of a focal plane wavefront sensor and of a high order deformable
mirror. These adaptive optic systems must reach a residual error in the
corrected wavefront of less than 0.1 nm (RMS) with a rate of 1 kHz. In

amplitude aberrations. An experimental high contrast bench has been developed
at the Paris Observatory (LESIA). This bench includes a Boston Micromachine
deformable mirror composed of 1024 actuators. For a precise analysis of its
surface and performance, we characterized this mirror on the interferometric
bench developed since 2004 at the Marseille Observatory (LAM). In this paper,
we present this interferometric bench as well as the results of the analysis.

We study how the current density distribution supporting the global
electromagnetic configuration is formed by analyzing particle trajectories. We
found that electrons precipitate to the return current layer inside the light
cylinder and positrons precipitate to the current sheet outside the light

distribution required by the global electrodynamics. Moreover, there is a
population of electrons trapped in the region close to the Y-point. On the

combine techniques from stochastic geometry and statistical physics to
determine the joint distribution of all Minkowski functionals. We achieve an
accurate characterization of the background structure for large scan windows
(with up to $15\times15$ pixels), where the number of microstates varies over
up to 64 orders of magnitude. Moreover, in a detailed simulation study, we
confirm the statistical significance of features in the background noise and
discuss how to correct for trial effects. We also present a local correction of
detector effects that can considerably enhance the sensitivity of the analysis.
In the third paper of this series, we will use the here derived refined
structure characterization for a more sensitive data analysis that can detect
formerly undetected sources.

[X/Fe]-age relations previously found for solar twins. [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and
[Zn/Fe] decrease by ~0.1 dex over the lifetime of the Galactic thin disk due to
delayed contribution of iron from Type Ia supernovae relative to prompt
production of Mg, Al, and Zn in Type II supernovae. [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al], on the
other hand, increase by ~0.3 dex, which can be explained by an increasing
contribution of s-process elements from low-mass AGB stars as time goes on. The
trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are more complicated due to variations of the ratio
between refractory and volatile elements among stars of similar age. Two stars
with about the same age as the Sun show very different trends of [X/H] as a
function of elemental condensation temperature Tc and for 16 Cyg, the two

for quantum lattice systems whose amplitudes can be sampled exactly and
efficiently. They work by gluing together states of overlapping clusters of
sites on the lattice, called correlators. Recently Carleo and Troyer Science
355, 602 (2017) introduced a new type sampleable ansatz called neural-network
quantum states (NQS) that are inspired by the restricted Boltzmann model used
in machine learning. By employing the formalism of tensor networks we show that
NQS are a special form of CPS with novel properties. Diagramatically a number
of simple observations become transparent. Namely, that NQS are CPS built from
extensively sized GHZ-form correlators, which are related to a canonical
polyadic decomposition of a tensor, making them uniquely unbiased
geometrically. Another immediate implication of the equivalence to CPS is that
we are able to formulate exact NQS representations for a wide range of
paradigmatic states, including superposition of weighed-graph states, the
Laughlin state, toric code states, and the resonating valence bond state. These
examples reveal the potential of using higher dimensional hidden units and a
second hidden layer in NQS. The major outlook of this study is the elevation of
NQS to correlator operators allowing them to enhance conventional
well-established variational Monte Carlo approaches for strongly correlated
fermions.

a traffic sign Visibility Evaluation Model (VEM) to measure the traffic sign
visibility for a given viewpoint. Then, based on the VEM, we proposed the

temperature distribution of a tidally locked Super-Earth, but raises a number
of puzzling questions about the planet's climate. The phase curve has a high
amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a significant eastward
hot-spot shift as well as a large day-night temperature contrast. We use a
general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the
relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these
seemingly contradictory features. We confirm theoretical models of tidally
locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and
rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic
properties. Our best-fitting atmosphere has a significant hot-spot shift and
day-night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase
curve. We discuss possible physical processes which could explain the
observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO
from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve
amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could
be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight,
a surface pressure of several bar and a strong eastward circulation, with
night-side cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between
our model and the observations.

particular, the global temperature is given by the rest frame temperature times
the gamma factor of special relativity which is the inverse transformation
compared to the case of stationary blackfolds. In addition we define two new

integrated velocity on the brane. We find that a phase transition occurs by

absence of pigment-producing cells in those regions. The distribution of the
white and colored zones does not follow the classical Turing patterns. Here we
present a modeling framework for pattern formation that enables to easily
modify the relationship between three factors with different feedback
mechanisms. These factors consist of two diffusing factors and a
cell-autonomous immobile transcription factor. Globally the model allowed to
distinguishing four different situations. Two situations result in the
production of classical Turing patterns; regularly spaced spots and labyrinth
patterns. Moreover, an initial slope in the activation of the transcription
factor produces straight lines. The third situation does not lead to patterns,
but results in different homogeneous color tones. Finally, the fourth one sheds
new light on the possible mechanisms leading to the formation of piebald
patterns exemplified by the random patterns on the fur of some cow strains and
Dalmatian dogs. We demonstrate that these piebald patterns are of transient
nature, develop from random initial conditions and rely on a system's
bi-stability. The main novelty lies in our finding that the presence of a
cell-autonomous factor not only expands the range of reaction diffusion
parameters in which a pattern may arise, but also extends the pattern-forming
abilities of the reaction-diffusion equations.

parametrized incompressible turbulent flows. The new contributions are
threefold. First, we propose a constrained Galerkin formulation that corrects
the standard Galerkin statement by incorporating prior information about the
long-time attractor. For explicit and semi-implicit time discretizations, our
statement reads as a constrained quadratic programming problem where the
objective function is the Euclidean norm of the error in the reduced Galerkin
(algebraic) formulation, while the constraints correspond to bounds for the
maximum and minimum value of the coefficients of the $N$-term expansion.
Second, we propose an \emph{a posteriori} error indicator, which corresponds to
the dual norm of the residual associated with the time-averaged momentum
equation. We demonstrate that the error indicator is highly-correlated with the
error in mean flow prediction, and can be efficiently computed through an
offline/online strategy. Third, we propose a Greedy algorithm for the
construction of an approximation space/procedure valid over a range of
parameters; the Greedy is informed by the \emph{a posteriori} error indicator
developed in this paper. We illustrate our approach and we demonstrate its
effectiveness by studying the dependence of a two-dimensional turbulent
lid-driven cavity flow on the Reynolds number.

expressions for its partial derivatives, in terms of certain expectations
$\mathbb{E}[(\partial^{\alpha}g)(X_{\Sigma})]$ of partial (distributional)

the expectation $\mathbb{E}[g(X_{\Sigma})]$ of a nonlinear function
$g(X_{\Sigma})$ of a Gaussian random vector $X_{\Sigma}$ with possibly
correlated entries.
  For the case when $g\left(x\right) = g_{1}(x_{1}) \cdots g_{n}(x_{n})$ has
tensor-product structure, the above result is known in the engineering

damping are calculated by solving a simplified version of the gyrokinetic
equation. This system of equations is applied to the study of a chain of freely
rotating magnetic islands in a tokamak, resulting from the nonlinear evolution
of a resistive tearing mode, to determine the islands rotation velocity
consistently with the fields radial profiles close to the resonant surface. The
island rotation velocity is determined by imposing the torque-balance
condition. The equations thus deduced are applied to the study of two different
collisional regimes, namely the weak-damping regime and the intermediate
damping regime. The equations reduce, in the weak damping regime, to a form
already obtained in previous works, while an additional term, containing the
lowest order FLR corrections to the poloidal flow damping, appears in the
intermediate damping regime. The numerical integration of the final system of

Science, Google Scholar, HOLLIS and ScienceDirect from their inception to June
2016. The 25 studies that were included had a total of 1349 participants (727
participants with autism and 622 controls) and an age range of 0-40 years.
Prolongation of wave V in autism had a significant negative correlation with
age (R2=0.23; P=.01). The 22 studies below age 18 years showed a significantly
prolonged wave V in autism (Standard Mean Difference=0.6 [95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8];
P<.001). The 3 studies above 18 years of age showed a significantly shorter
wave V in autism (SMD=-0.6 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.2]; P=.004). Prolonged ABR was
consistent in infants and children with autism, suggesting it can serve as an
autism biomarker at infancy. As the ABR is routinely used to screen infants for
hearing impairment, the opportunity for replication studies is extensive.

starting from the linearized Euler equations and the convected wave equation

shift, spectral broadening, and multiple scattering effects of the

7-degree and 15-degree half-power beamwidths (HPBW) were used at the

the TX antenna was scanned over a 120-degree sector and the RX antenna was

two other elevation planes on both sides of the strongest elevation angle,

First, we start with three different double integrals that have been previously
used in the literature to show $S(2)=\pi^2/8,$ which implies Euler's identity
$\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6.$ Then, we generalize each integral in order to find the
considered sums. The $k$ dimensional analogue of the first integral is the
density function of the quotient of $k$ independent, nonnegative Cauchy random
variables. In seeking this function, we encounter a special logarithmic
integral that we can directly relate to $S(k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of
the second integral, upon a change of variables, is the volume of a convex
polytope, which can be expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise
sums of $k$ independent uniform random variables. We use combinatorial
arguments to find the volume, which in turn gives new closed formulas for
$S(k)$ and $\zeta(2k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of the last integral, upon
another change of variables, is an integral of the joint density function of
$k$ Cauchy random variables over a hyperbolic polytope. This integral can be
expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise products of these random

well-posedness of the Green-Naghdi equations (and their justification as an
asymptotic model for the water waves equations) has been extensively studied,
but always under the assumption that the water depth is bounded from below by a
positive constant. The aim of this article is to remove this assumption. The
problem then becomes a free-boundary problem since the position of the
shoreline is unknown and driven by the solution itself. For the (hyperbolic)
nonlinear shallow water equation, this problem is very related to the vacuum
problem for a compressible gas. The Green-Naghdi equation include additional
nonlinear, dispersive and topography terms with a complex degenerate structure
at the boundary. In particular, the degeneracy of the topography terms makes
the problem loose its quasilinear structure and become fully nonlinear.
Dispersive smoothing also degenerates and its behavior at the boundary can be
described by an ODE with regular singularity. These issues require the
development of new tools, some of which of independent interest such as the
study of the mixed initial boundary value problem for dispersive perturbations

the $H$-function for some of these flows. These formulas show that in some
cases, despite being very far from equilibrium, the relationship between
density, temperature and entropy is exactly the same as in the equilibrium

  Algorithms",,,"10.1109/TSP.2018.2827326",,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient estimation of wideband spectrum is of great importance for
applications such as cognitive radio. Recently, sub-Nyquist sampling schemes
based on compressed sensing have been proposed to greatly reduce the sampling
rate. However, the important issue of quantization has not been fully
addressed, particularly for high-resolution spectrum and parameter estimation.
In this paper, we aim to recover spectrally-sparse signals and the
corresponding parameters, such as frequency and amplitudes, from heavy
quantizations of their noisy complex-valued random linear measurements, e.g.
only the quadrant information. We first characterize the Cramer-Rao bound under
Gaussian noise, which highlights the trade-off between sample complexity and
bit depth under different signal-to-noise ratios for a fixed budget of bits.
Next, we propose a new algorithm based on atomic norm soft thresholding for
signal recovery, which is equivalent to proximal mapping of properly designed
surrogate signals with respect to the atomic norm that motivates spectral
sparsity. The proposed algorithm can be applied to both the single measurement
vector case, as well as the multiple measurement vector case. It is shown that
under the Gaussian measurement model, the spectral signals can be reconstructed
accurately with high probability, as soon as the number of quantized
measurements exceeds the order of K log n, where K is the level of spectral
sparsity and $n$ is the signal dimension. Finally, numerical simulations are
provided to validate the proposed approaches.

protoplanetary disks and therefore influences disk lifetimes and planet
formation timescales. However, the turbulent properties of protoplanetary disks
are poorly constrained observationally. Recent studies have found turbulent
speeds smaller than what fully-developed MRI would produce (Flaherty et al.
2015, 2017). However, existing studies assumed a constant CO/H2 ratio of 0.0001
in locations where CO is not frozen-out or photo-dissociated. Our previous
studies of evolving disk chemistry indicate that CO is depleted by
incorporation into complex organic molecules well inside the freeze-out radius
of CO. We consider the effects of this chemical depletion on measurements of
turbulence. Simon et al. (2015) suggested that the ratio of the peak line flux
to the flux at line center of the CO J=3-2 transition is a reasonable
diagnostic of turbulence, so we focus on that metric, while adding some
analysis of the more complex effects on spatial distribution. We simulate the
emission lines of CO based on chemical evolution models presented in Yu et al.
(2016), and find that the peak-to-trough ratio changes as a function of time as
CO is destroyed. Specifically, a CO-depleted disk with high turbulent velocity
mimics the peak-to-trough ratios of a non-CO-depleted disk with lower turbulent
velocity. We suggest that disk observers and modelers take into account the
possibility of CO depletion when using line peak-to-trough ratios to constrain
the degree of turbulence in disks. Assuming that CO/H2 = 0.0001 at all disk
radii can lead to underestimates of turbulent speeds in the disk by at least
0.2 km/s.

gravity in the absence of matter, can be discretized over random discrete
spaces obtained by gluing families of polytopes together in all possible ways.
In the physical limit of small Newton constant, only the spaces which maximize
the mean curvature survive. In two dimensions, this results in a theory of
random discrete spheres, which converge in the continuum limit towards the
Brownian sphere, a random fractal space interpreted as a quantum random
space-time. In this limit, the continuous Liouville theory of $D=2$ quantum
gravity is recovered.
  Previous results in higher dimension regarded triangulations - gluings of
tetrahedra or $D$-dimensional generalizations, leading to the continuum random
tree, or gluings of simple colored building blocks of small sizes, for which
multi-trace matrix model results are recovered. This work aims at providing
combinatorial tools which would allow a systematic study of richer building
blocks and of the spaces they generate in the continuum. We develop a bijection
with stacked two-dimensional discrete surfaces, and detail how it can be used
to classify discrete spaces according to their mean curvature and topology.
  A number of blocks are analyzed, including the new infinite family of
bi-pyramids, as well as toroidal and $D$-dimensional generalizations. The
relation to random tensor models is detailed. A central concern is the lowest
bound on the number of ($D-2$)-cells for any given blocks, or equivalently the
right scaling for the associated tensor model to have a well-behaved $1/N$
expansion. We also apply our bijection to the identification of the graphs
contributing at any order to the $2n$-point functions of the colored SYK model,
and to the enumeration of generalized unicellular maps - spaces obtained from a

neural networks trained using gradient descent. We study the

linear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics
of learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and
signal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of
gradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and
overfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network
sizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of
samples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.
Additionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires
starting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural
networks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their
generalization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce
overtraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort. We
identify two novel phenomena underlying this behavior in overcomplete models:
first, there is a frozen subspace of the weights in which no learning occurs
under gradient descent; and second, the statistical properties of the
high-dimensional regime yield better-conditioned input correlations which
protect against overtraining. We demonstrate that naive application of
worst-case theories such as Rademacher complexity are inaccurate in predicting
the generalization performance of deep neural networks, and derive an
alternative bound which incorporates the frozen subspace and conditioning
effects and qualitatively matches the behavior observed in simulation.

increasing impact velocity, similar-sized collisions can also result in
hit-and-run outcomes for sufficiently oblique impact angles and large enough
projectile-to-target mass ratios. We study volatile transfer and loss focusing
on hit-and-run encounters by means of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics
simulations, including all main parameters: impact velocity, impact angle, mass
ratio, and also the total colliding mass. We find a broad range of overall
water losses, up to 75% in the most energetic hit-and-run events, and confirm
the much more severe consequences for the smaller body also for stripping of
volatile layers. Transfer of water between projectile and target inventories is
found to be mostly rather inefficient, and final water contents are dominated
by pre-collision inventories reduced by impact losses, for similar
pre-collision water mass fractions. Comparison with our numerical results shows
that current collision outcome models are not accurate enough to reliably
predict these composition changes in hit-and-run events. To also account for
non-mechanical losses we estimate the amount of collisionally vaporized water
over a broad range of masses, and find that these contributions are
particularly important in collisions of ~Mars-sized bodies, with sufficiently
high impact energies, but still relatively low gravity. Our results clearly
indicate that the cumulative effect of several (hit-and-run) collisions can
efficiently strip protoplanets of their volatile layers, especially the smaller

r and separation d) has been numerically evaluated over relative permittivities
ranging from 1 to 80 and aspect ratios ranging from 0.001 to 10. A new
perspective is presented by which, the total capacitance, for a given disc
radius r, is found to depend only on a simple scaled disc separation for the
whole range of aspect ratios and relative permittivities considered. The
scaling notion stems from noting that the path length has to be larger than
what it would be in free space to have the same potential difference across the
charged discs since the electric field strength is reduced within a homogenous
dielectric medium by the relative permittivity. This scaling permits
translation of practical measurements across a range of aspect ratios and
relative permittivities. Further, the scaling feature allows for any
computational approach that determines the total capacitance in free space, to
be applicable for dielectric media having relative permittivities in the range
1 to 80. It is believed that the scaling would become better with increasing
relative permittivities for practically relevant separations.

routing EVs around MEDs on the road network, which is based on constraint logic

proposed method exploits Inter-Vehicle (IVC) communications in order to
eco-route electric vehicles. We argue that combining modern communications
between vehicles and state of the art technologies on energy transfer, the
driving range of EVs can be extended without the need for larger batteries or
overtly costly infrastructure. We present extensive simulations in city
conditions that show the driving range and consequently the overall travel time
of electric vehicles is improved with intelligent routing in the presence of

crystallographically-equivalent local moments. The anisotropy field for
collinear z-axis antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is constructed so that it is
aligned in the direction of each ordered and/or field-induced thermal-average
moment with a magnitude proportional to the moment, whereas that for XY
anisotropy is defined to be in the direction of the projection of the moment
onto the xy plane, again with a magnitude proportional to the moment.
Properties studied include the zero-field Neel temperature TN, ordered moment,
heat capacity and anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of the AFM phase versus T
with moments aligned either along the z axis or in the xy plane. Also
determined are the high-field magnetization perpendicular to the axis or plane
of collinear or planar noncollinear AFM ordering, the high-field magnetization
along the z axis of a collinear z-axis AFM, spin-flop (SF), and paramagnetic
(PM) phases, and the free energies of these phases versus T, H, and hA1. Phase
diagrams at T = 0 in the Hz-hA1 plane and at T > 0 in the Hz-T plane are
constructed for spins S = 1/2. For hA1 = 0 the SF phase is stable at low field
and the PM phase at high field with no AFM phase present. As hA1 increases, the
phase diagram contains the AFM, SF and PM phases. Further increases in hA1 lead
to the disappearance of the SF phase and the appearance of a tricritical point
on the AFM-PM transition curve. Applications of the theory to extract hA1 from

most effective LSTM network design proposed in the previous work by using a
promising neuroevolution method based on ant colony optimization (ACO) to
develop and enhance the LSTM cell structure of the network. A parallelized

and pedestrian distraction is emerging as one of the main causes of grave and

measuring fine-grained user movements and context, provides a tremendous
opportunity for designing effective pedestrian safety systems and applications.
Accurate and efficient recognition of pedestrian distractions in real-time
given the memory, computation and communication limitations of these devices,
however, remains the key technical challenge in the design of such systems.
Earlier research efforts in pedestrian distraction detection using data
available from mobile and wearable devices have primarily focused only on
achieving high detection accuracy, resulting in designs that are either
resource intensive and unsuitable for implementation on mainstream mobile
devices, or computationally slow and not useful for real-time pedestrian safety
applications, or require specialized hardware and less likely to be adopted by

design of a novel complex activity recognition framework which employs motion
data available from users' mobile and wearable devices and a lightweight
frequency matching approach to accurately and efficiently recognize complex
distraction related activities, and (ii) a comprehensive comparative evaluation
of the proposed framework with well-known complex activity recognition
techniques in the literature with the help of data collected from human subject

ferrotoroidic ordered phases, which sustain linear magneto-electric coupling
and multiferroic behaviour. However, engineering ferrotoroidic coupling is
known to be a challenging task. Here we have isolated a
Cr$^{\mathrm{III}}$Dy$^{\mathrm{III}}_6$ complex, which exhibits the much
sought-after ferrotoroidic ground state with an enhanced toroidal moment,
solely arising from intramolecular dipolar interactions. Moreover, a
theoretical analysis of the observed sub-Kelvin zero-field hysteretic spin
dynamics of Cr$^{\mathrm{III}}$Dy$^{\mathrm{III}}_6$ reveals the pivotal role
played by ferrotoroidic states in slowing down the magnetic relaxation, in
spite of large calculated single-ion quantum tunnelling rates.

Havelka, 2010; Warriner et al., 2013). Our affective ratings had significant
effects on categorizations based on gender, gender-parental role and the time

significant affectivity differences of gender and age (Warriner et al., 2013)

problem is that the borders of such systems are often not well-defined

possible the system shall at least be able to help determine potential cause(s)

proposed. However, the applicability of the corresponding approaches,
