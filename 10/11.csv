a mu-wavelet decomposition of a seismic signal allows for arrival detection of
various waves on a single-component seismogram with good precision. However,
the question of interpretation of the type of wave arriving has not been
addressed. The problem lies in the fact that the algorithm detects more than
two arrivals even on seismograms with little noise, the peaks corresponding to
P and S wave arrivals on the indicator function are not always the strongest,
and the peak corresponding to the P wave arrival is not always the first peak
detected. We propose to use a signal/noise relationship function in a running
window as a weight coefficient of the indicator function obtained using the
mu-wavelet transformation, which allows to isolate specifically those arrivals
which correspond to significant changes in the signal amplitude. To interpret
wave arrivals on linear registration systems (well observation systems for
monitoring hydrolic fracturing, ultrasound investigations on models and samples
of geological material), an algorithm was also developed to isolate arrivals
that best correspond to arrivals on all registration points that have
observation systems. As a result, we propose an algorithm that allows to
automatically isolate arrivals of S and P waves on ""frac"" event recordings of a
well observation system, and provides agreement with manual detection that

spectra clearly identifies transition involving metallic zinc in the irradiated
samples. Intense PL emission from IZn related shallow donor bound excitons
(DBX) is visible in the 10 K spectra for all samples. Although overall PL is
largely reduced with irradiation disorder, DBX intensity is increased for the
highest fluence irradiated sample. Raman study indicates damage in both zinc

defect complexes involving VO, IZn and IO are visible after irradiation with
intermediate fluence. Further increase of fluence shows, to some extent, a
homogenization of disorder. Huge reduction of resistance is also noted for this
sample. Certainly, high irradiation fluence induces a qualitative modification
of the conventional (and highly resistive) grain boundary (GB) structure of
granular ZnO. Low resistive path, involving IZn related shallow donors, across

VO) agglomerate more and more with increasing irradiation fluence and finally
get transformed to voids. Results as a whole have been elucidated with a model

integration and maximisation of a univariate real function are computationally
hard in a well-defined sense. Yet, both functionals are routinely computed at
great speed in practice. We aim to resolve this apparent paradox by studying
classes of functions which can be feasibly integrated and maximised, together
with representations for these classes of functions which encode the
information which is necessary to uniformly compute integral and maximum in
polynomial time. The theoretical framework for this is the second-order
complexity theory for operators in analysis which was introduced by Kawamura
and Cook (2012). The representations we study are based on rigorous
approximation by polynomials, piecewise polynomials, and rational functions. We
compare these representations with respect to polytime reducibility as well as
with respect to their ability to quickly evaluate symbolic expressions in a
given language. We show that the representation based on rigorous approximation
by piecewise polynomials is polytime equivalent to the representation based on
rigorous approximation by rational functions. With this representation, all
terms in a certain language, which is expressive enough to contain the maximum
and integral of most functions of practical interest, can be evaluated in
polynomial time. By contrast, both the representation based on polynomial
approximation and the standard representation based on function evaluation,
which implicitly underlies the Ko-Friedman result, require exponential time to
evaluate certain terms in this language. We confirm our theoretical results by
an implementation in Haskell, which provides some evidence that second-order
polynomial time computability is similarly closely tied with practical
feasibility as its first-order counterpart.

of this nature generally involves analysis of past claim history and different
characteristics of the insured objects and the policyholders. Generalized
linear models (GLMs) have become the industry's standard approach for pricing
and modeling risks of this nature. However, the GLM approach utilizes a single
""best"" model on which loss predictions are based, which ignores the uncertainty
among the competing models and variable selection. An additional characteristic
of motor insurance data sets is the presence of many categorical variables,
within which the number of levels is high. In particular, not all levels of
such variables may be statistically significant and rather some subsets of the
levels may be merged to give a smaller overall number of levels for improved
model parsimony and interpretability. A method is proposed for assessing the
optimal manner in which to collapse a factor with many levels into one with a
smaller number of levels, then Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used to blend
model predictions from all reasonable models to account for factor collapsing
uncertainty. This method will be computationally intensive due to the number of
factors being collapsed as well as the possibly large number of levels within
factors. Hence a stochastic optimisation is proposed to quickly find the best
collapsing cases across the model space.

dynamical systems have been at least as extensively studied as continuous-time
systems. For example, model predictive control is typically studied in
discrete-time via Lyapunov methods. However, there is a peculiar absence in the
standard literature of standard treatments of Lyapunov functions and LaSalle
invariance principle for discrete-time nonlinear systems. Most of the textbooks
on nonlinear dynamical systems focus only on continuous-time systems. In
Chapter 1 of the book by LaSalle [11], the author establishes the LaSalle
invariance principle for difference equation systems. However, all the useful
lemmas in [11] are given in the form of exercises with no proof provided. In
this document, we provide the proofs of all the lemmas proposed in [11] that

discrete-time dynamical systems. We organize all the materials in a
self-contained manner. We first introduce some basic concepts and definitions
in Section 1, such as dynamical systems, invariant sets, and limit sets. In
Section 2 we present and prove some useful lemmas on the properties of
invariant sets and limit sets. Finally, we establish the original LaSalle
invariance principle for discrete-time dynamical systems and a simple extension
in Section~3. In Section 4, we provide some references on extensions of LaSalle
invariance principles for further reading. This document is intended for
educational and tutorial purposes and contains lemmas that might be useful as a

using static source code analysis and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)

programs and with a benchmark containing large and complex programs. The
evaluation results show that IntGuard can precisely (i.e., no false positives

parallelization of the Lagrangian Dual Ascent algorithm on the GPUs, which is
used for solving a QAP formulation based on Level-2 Refactorization
Linearization Technique (RLT2). The Linear Assignment sub-problems (LAPs) in
this procedure are solved using our accelerated Hungarian algorithm [Date,
Ketan, Rakesh Nagi. 2016. GPU-accelerated Hungarian algorithms for the Linear

dual ascent algorithm in a parallel branch-and-bound scheme and conduct
extensive computational experiments on single and multiple GPUs, using problem
instances with up to 42 facilities from the QAPLIB. The experiments suggest
that our GPU-based approach is scalable and it can be used to obtain tight
lower bounds on large QAP instances. Our accelerated branch-and-bound scheme is
able to comfortably solve Nugent and Taillard instances (up to 30 facilities)
from the QAPLIB, using modest number of GPUs.

single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training.
Secondly, we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of

works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks,
recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique
works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on
large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the memory consumption of
deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors, we can also expect a
significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.

partially explain why most geometric intersection graphs arising in discrete

one needs to probe CMB-lensing modes out to L ~ 35,000, requiring a CMB
experiment with about 20 arcsecond resolution or better. We show that a CMB
survey covering 4,000 square degrees of sky, with an instrumental sensitivity
of 0.5 uK-arcmin at 18 arcsecond resolution, could distinguish between cold
dark matter and an alternative, such as 1 keV warm dark matter or 10^(-22) eV
fuzzy dark matter with about 4-sigma significance. A survey of the same
resolution with 0.1 uK-arcmin noise could distinguish between cold dark matter
and these alternatives at better than 20-sigma significance; such
high-significance measurements may also allow one to distinguish between a
suppression of power due to either baryonic effects or the particle nature of
dark matter, since each impacts the shape of the lensing power spectrum
differently. CMB temperature maps yield higher signal-to-noise than
polarization maps in this small-scale regime; thus, systematic effects, such as
from extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds, need to be carefully considered.
However, these systematic concerns can likely be mitigated with known
techniques. Next-generation CMB lensing may thus provide a robust and powerful
method of measuring the small-scale matter power spectrum.

density of the universe is dominated by a decoupled non-relativistic species.
Decoupling during matter domination changes the freeze-out dynamics, since the
Hubble rate is parametrically different for matter and radiation domination.
Furthermore, for successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis the state dominating the
early universe energy density must decay, this dilutes (or repopulates) the
dark matter. As a result, the masses and couplings required to reproduce the
observed dark matter relic density can differ significantly from radiation
dominated freeze-out.

the most common type of stellar explosion realized in nature. They are defined
by the presence of prominent hydrogen lines in their spectra. Type II
supernovae are observed only in star-forming galaxies, and several events have
been directly linked to massive star progenitors. Five main subclasses are
identified: Type IIP (displaying a plateau in their light curve), Type IIL
(displaying a light curve decline), Type IIn (displaying narrow emission
lines), Type IIb (displaying increasingly strong He features with time) and
87A-likes (displaying long-rising light curves similar to that of SN 1987A).
Type IIP supernovae have been robustly established as the explosions of red
supergiants, while the progenitors of Type IIL's remain elusive. Type IIn's are
likely linked to luminous blue variables, Type IIb progenitors may be
interacting binary systems and the prototype of the 87A-like class was observed
to be the explosion of a blue supergiant. The diversity in progenitor mass,
metallicity, binarity and rotation is likely responsible for the diversity in
observed explosion types, but the connection between progenitor parameters and
supernova properties is not yet entirely understood theoretically nor fully
mapped observationally. New observational methods for constraining this
connection are currently being implemented, including the analyses of large
samples of events, making use of very early data (obtained hours to days from
explosion) and statistical studies of host-galaxy properties.

larger-scale structure. For the \textit{Strong} variable candidates, we find an

further than 7 kpc (~4r_e). Analysis of the isophotes of the stacks reveal that
the ellipticity remains constant up to the last measured point, which means
that the individual galaxies have a non-varying position angle and axis ratio

the radial (VR), azimuthal (Vphi) and vertical (Vz) components of associated
Galactocentric velocity. We search in particular for variation in all three
velocity components with distance above and below the disc midplane, as well as
how each component of Vz (line-of-sight and tangential velocity projections)
modifies the obtained vertical structure. To study the dependence of velocity
on proper motion and distance we use two main samples: a RAVE sample including
proper motions from the Tycho-2, PPMXL and UCAC4 catalogues, and a RAVE-TGAS
sample with inferred distances and proper motions from the TGAS and UCAC5
catalogues. In both samples, we identify asymmetries in VR and Vz. Below the
plane we find the largest radial gradient to be dVR / dR = -7.01+- 0.61 km\s
kpc, in agreement with recent studies. Above the plane we find a similar
gradient with dVR / dR= -9.42+- 1.77 km\s kpc. By comparing our results with
previous studies, we find that the structure in Vz is strongly dependent on the
adopted proper motions. Using the Galaxia Milky Way model, we demonstrate that
distance uncertainties can create artificial wave-like patterns. In contrast to
previous suggestions of a breathing mode seen in RAVE data, our results support
a combination of bending and breathing modes, likely generated by a combination
of external or internal and external mechanisms.

feedback has a significant impact on both the inflowing and outflowing
circumgalactic medium by driving outflows, reducing diffuse inflow rates, and
by increasing the neutral fraction of inflowing gas. By temporally stacking
simulation outputs we find that significant net mass exchange occurs between
inflowing and outflowing phases: none of the phases are mass-conserving. In
particular, we find that the mass in neutral outflowing hydrogen declines
exponentially with radius as gas flows outwards from the halo centre. This is
likely caused by a combination of both fountain-like cycling processes and
gradual photo/collisional ionization of outflowing gas. Our simulations do not
predict the presence of fast-moving neutral outflows in the CGM. Neutral
outflows instead move with modest radial velocities (~ 50 kms^-1), and the

99.6\% for the 2--4~keVee, 2--5~keVee and 2--6~keVee energy ranges,

$\gtrsim 3\sigma$ departures from the average in the 5-6~keVee energy range. In
addition, we examined several phenomenological models for the time dependence

descriptions of the modulation amplitude as decreasing with time are preferred
over a constant modulation amplitude at anywhere between 1$\sigma$ and
3$\sigma$, depending on the phenomenological model for the time dependence and
the signal energy range considered. A time dependent modulation amplitude is
not expected for a dark matter signal, at least for dark matter halo

cell motility, division, growth, and tensile strength. To enable this wide

filaments continuously disassemble and reassemble via active
de/re-polymerization. However, the question remains as to how
de/re-polymerization kinetics of individual actin filaments translate to
time-varying mechanics of dis/re-assembling networks. To address this question,
to ultimately elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable cells to exhibit a
myriad of transitory mechanical properties, we couple time-resolved active
microrheology with microfluidics to measure the time-varying viscoelastic
moduli of entangled and crosslinked actin networks during chemically-triggered
network disassembly and reassembly. We also develop a corresponding
mathematical model that relates the time-evolution of filament length to the
resulting time-dependent storage moduli of evolving networks. During
disassembly, we find that the moduli exhibit two distinct exponential decays,
with experimental time constants of $\sim$169 and $\sim$47 min, which we show
arises from a phase transition from a rigid percolated network to a non-rigid
regime occurring after $\sim$90 min. During reassembly, measured moduli exhibit
linear increase with time for $\sim$90 min, after which steady-state values are
achieved. Our theoretical model shows that reassembly mechanics are dominated
by elongation kinetics, and that elongation rates are much slower than has been
recently assumed. Our measurements shed much needed light onto how
polymerization kinetics map to time-varying mechanics of actively evolving
cytoskeleton networks, and provide a powerful platform for studying other
active and dynamic systems currently under intense investigation.

non-globally-hyperbolic; this is the most commonly discussed version of the
paradox in the foundational and semipopular literature, and the case for
calling it `paradoxical' is less than compelling. But the second arises from a
clash between a fully-statistical-mechanical interpretation of black hole
evaporation and the quantum-field-theoretic description used in derivations of
the Hawking effect. This version of the paradox arises long before a black hole
completely evaporates, seems to be the version that has played a central role
in quantum gravity, and is genuinely paradoxical. After explicating the

implanted medical monitoring sensor nodes, which are designed to continually
collect the medical information of the target patients. Multichannel is often
used in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes
and the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention.
The health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink
node (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health
emergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for
multichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to
meet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links.
As a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the
scheduled lossy links. Besides, potential collisions in the schedules also
incur considerable delay in delivering the sensing data. In this paper, we
propose a novel deadline- driven Link quality Aware Channel Assignment scheme
(LACA), where link quality, deadlines and collisions are jointly considered.
LACA prioritizes links with urgent deadlines and heavy collisions. Besides,
LACA allows the exploition of the spare slots for retransmissions on lossy
links, which can further reduce the retransmission delay. Extensive simulation
experiments show that compared to the existing approaches, LACA can better
utilize the wireless spectrum and achieve higher packet delivery ratio before
the deadline.

repeat the same management tasks on the each device, such as updating software,
changing configurations, backup, and replicating data for availability. To
prevent the management burden from increasing with the number of devices, we
propose that all devices run a single system image called a personal computing

each device, but provide a consistent view of application and operating state
across all devices. As a result, management tasks can be performed once on any
device and will be automatically propagated to all other devices belonging to

hybrid framework to improve the performance of lattice reduction (LR) aided
precoding in VP. First, we perform a simple precoding using zero forcing (ZF)
or successive interference cancellation (SIC) based on a reduced lattice basis.
Since the signal space after LR-ZF or LR-SIC precoding can be shown to be
bounded to a small range, then along with sufficient orthogonality of the
lattice basis guaranteed by LR, they collectively pave the way for the
subsequent application of an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, which
further boosts the performance of any suboptimal precoder. Our work shows that
the AMP algorithm can be beneficial for a lattice decoding problem whose data
symbols lie in integers $\mathbb{Z}$ and entries of the lattice basis may bot
be i.i.d. Gaussian. Numerical results confirm the low-complexity AMP algorithm
can improve the symbol error rate (SER) performance of LR aided precoding
significantly. Lastly, the hybrid scheme is also proved effective when solving
the data detection problem of massive MIMO systems without using LR.

the classes in their distribution of service times and patience times. The
customers are served on a first-come, first served basis (FCFS) regardless of
their class. Such systems are common in customer call centers, which often
segment their arrivals into classes of callers whose requests differ in their
complexity and criticality. We first consider an $M$/$G$/1 + $M$ queue and then
analyze the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ case. Analyzing these systems using a queue
length process proves intractable as it would require us to keep track of the
class of each customer at each position in queue. Consequently, we introduce a
virtual waiting time process where the service times of customers who will
eventually abandon the system are not considered. We analyze this process to
obtain performance measures such as the percentage of customers receiving
service in each class, the expected waiting times of customers in each class,
and the average number of customers waiting in queue. We use our
characterization to perform a numerical analysis of the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$
system, and find several managerial implications of administering a FCFS system
with multiple classes of impatient customers. Finally, we compare the
performance a system based on data from a call center with the steady-state
performance measures of a comparable $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ system. We find that the
performance measures of the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ system serve as good
approximations of the system based on real data.

coalescent model assume that no gene flow occurs following speciation. While
some studies have examined the impact of gene flow on estimation accuracy for
certain methods, limited analytical work has been undertaken to directly assess
the potential effect of gene flow across a species phylogeny. In this paper, we
consider a three-taxon isolation-with-migration model that allows gene flow
between sister taxa for a brief period following speciation, as well as
variation in the effective population sizes across the tree. We derive the
probabilities of each of the three gene tree topologies under this model, and
show that for certain choices of the gene flow and effective population size
parameters, anomalous gene trees (i.e., gene trees that are discordant with the
species tree but that have higher probability than the gene tree concordant
with the species tree) exist. We characterize the region of parameter space
producing anomalous trees, and show that the probability of the gene tree that
is concordant with the species tree can be arbitrarily small. We then show that
the SVDQuartets method is theoretically valid under the model of gene flow
between sister taxa. We study its performance on simulated data and compare it
to two other commonly-used methods for species tree inference, ASTRAL and
MP-EST. The simulations show that ASTRAL and MP-EST can be statistically
inconsistent when gene flow is present, while SVDQuartets performs well, though
large sample sizes may be required for certain parameter choices.

the predicted localization masks are classified into soiling types using the
webly supervised learning. For improving localization capabilities of CNNs, we

classification tasks, and there is interest in applicability to neuroimaging
critical findings. This study evaluates the efficacy of 2D deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting basal ganglia (BG) hemorrhage on
noncontrast head CT.
  Materials and Methods: 170 unique de-identified HIPAA-compliant noncontrast
head CTs were obtained, those with and without BG hemorrhage. 110 cases were
held-out for test, and 60 were split into training (45) and validation (15),
consisting of 20 right, 20 left, and 20 no BG hemorrhage. Data augmentation was
performed to increase size and variation of the training dataset by 48-fold.
Two DCNNs were used to classify the images-AlexNet and GoogLeNet-using
untrained networks and those pre-trained on ImageNet. Area under the curves
(AUC) for the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated,
using the DeLong method for statistical comparison of ROCs.
  Results: The best performing model was the pre-trained augmented GoogLeNet,
which had an AUC of 1.00 in classification of hemorrhage. Preprocessing
augmentation increased accuracy for all networks (p<0.001), and pretrained
networks outperformed untrained ones (p<0.001) for the unaugmented models. The
best performing GoogLeNet model (AUC 1.00) outperformed the best performing
AlexNet model (AUC 0.95)(p=0.01).
  Conclusion: For this dataset, the best performing DCNN identified BG
hemorrhage on noncontrast head CT with an AUC of 1.00. Pretrained networks and
data augmentation increased classifier accuracy. Future prospective research
would be important to determine if the accuracy can be maintained on a larger
cohort of patients and for very small hemorrhages.

knowing if impact will occur, which part of the CME impacts, and its magnetic
properties. We explore the relation between CME deflections and rotations,
which change the position and orientation of a CME, and the resulting magnetic
profiles at 1 AU. For 45 STEREO-era, Earth-impacting CMEs, we determine the
solar source of each CME, reconstruct its coronal position and orientation, and
perform a ForeCAT (Kay et al. 2015a) simulation of the coronal deflection and
rotation. From the reconstructed and modeled CME deflections and rotations we
determine the solar cycle variation and correlations with CME properties. We
assume no evolution between the outer corona and 1 AU and use the ForeCAT
results to drive the FIDO in situ magnetic field model (Kay et al. 2017a),
allowing for comparisons with ACE and Wind observations. We do not attempt to
reproduce the arrival time. On average FIDO reproduces the in situ magnetic
field for each vector component with an error equivalent to 35% of the average
total magnetic field strength when the total modeled magnetic field is scaled
to match the average observed value. Random walk best fits distinguish between
ForeCAT's ability to determine FIDO's input parameters and the limitations of
the simple flux rope model. These best fits reduce the average error to 30%.
The FIDO results are sensitive to changes of order a degree in the CME
latitude, longitude, and tilt, suggesting that accurate space weather
predictions require accurate measurements of a CME's position and orientation.

is important in eroding the atmosphere of sub-Neptune planets. We construct
full hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with consistent thermochemistry and
ray-tracing radiative transfer, to understand the physics of atmospheric
photoevaporation caused by high energy photons from the host star. We identify
a region on the parameter space where a hydrostatic atmosphere cannot be
balanced by any plausible interplanetary pressure, so that the atmosphere is
particularly susceptible to loss by Parker wind. This region may lead an
absence of rich atmosphere (substantially H/He) for planets with low mass (M ~
3 M_earth). Improving on previous works, our simulations include detailed
microphysics and a self-consistent thermochemical network. Full numerical
simulations of photoevaporative outflows shows a typical outflow speed ~ 30
km/s and Mdot ~ 4e-10 M_earth/yr for a 5 M_earth fiducial model rocky-core
planet with 1e-2 of its mass in the atmosphere. Supersonic outflows are not
quenched by stellar wind ram pressure (up to 5 times the total pressure at
transonic points of the fiducial model). The outflows modulated by stellar wind
are collimated towards the night side of the planet, while the mass loss rate
is only ~ 25% lower than the fiducial model. By exploring the parameter space,
we find that EUV photoionization is most important in launching
photoevaporative wind. Other energetic radiation, including X-ray, are of
secondary importance. The leading cooling mechanism is ro-vibrational molecular
cooling and adiabatic expansion rather than recombination or Ly alpha cooling.
The wind speed is considerably higher than the escape velocity at the wind base
in most cases, hence the mass loss rate is proportional to the second power of
the EUV photosphere size R_euv, instead of the third, as suggested by previous
works...

question of inference on auction fundamentals (e.g. valuation distributions,
welfare measures) under weak assumptions on information structure. The question
is important as it allows us to learn about the valuation distribution in a
robust way, i.e., without assuming that a particular information structure
holds across observations. We leverage the recent contributions of
\cite{Bergemann2013} in the robust mechanism design literature that exploit the
link between Bayesian Correlated Equilibria and Bayesian Nash Equilibria in
incomplete information games to construct an econometrics framework for
learning about auction fundamentals using observed data on bids. We showcase
our construction of identified sets in private value and common value auctions.
Our approach for constructing these sets inherits the computational simplicity
of solving for correlated equilibria: checking whether a particular valuation
distribution belongs to the identified set is as simple as determining whether
a {\it linear} program is feasible. A similar linear program can be used to
construct the identified set on various welfare measures and counterfactual
objects. For inference and to summarize statistical uncertainty, we propose
novel finite sample methods using tail inequalities that are used to construct
confidence regions on sets. We also highlight methods based on Bayesian
bootstrap and subsampling. A set of Monte Carlo experiments show adequate
finite sample properties of our inference procedures. We illustrate our methods

of the PSZ, as well as water saturation in the PSZ, both increase with
wettability. We also numerically calculate the saturation exclusively contained

expected PSZ saturation. These results strongly reflect that the two-phase zone
is not solely made up of connected capillary networks, but also made of
disconnected water clusters or pockets. Moreover, we also find that global

numerical algorithms, thereby providing a huge potential for program
optimisation such as fusion, parallelisation, etc. One of the restrictions that
these languages typically have is that the number of elements in every array
has to be finite. This means that implementing streaming algorithms in such
languages requires new types of data structures, with operations that are not
immediately compatible with existing array operations or compiler
optimisations.
  In this paper, we propose a design for a functional language that natively
supports infinite arrays. We use ordinal numbers to introduce the notion of
infinity in shapes and indices. By doing so, we obtain a calculus that
naturally extends existing array calculi and, at the same time, allows for
recursive specifications as they are found in stream- and list-based settings.
Furthermore, the main language construct that can be thought of as an $n$-fold
cons operator gives rise to expressing transfinite recursion in data, something
that lists or streams usually do not support. This makes it possible to treat
the proposed calculus as a unifying theory of arrays, lists and streams. We
give an operational semantics of the proposed language, discuss design choices
that we have made, and demonstrate its expressibility with several examples. We
also demonstrate that the proposed formalism preserves a number of well-known
universal equalities from array/list/stream theories, and discuss
implementation-related challenges.

spherical coordinates with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The
structure of the flow at the impact moment is deduced from the spherical

amalgamation results in various ways. The main aim is to disentangle a given
edge-colored amalgamated graph so that the result is a graph in which the edges
are shared out among the vertices in ways that are fair with respect to several
notions of balance (such as between pairs of vertices, degrees of vertices in
the both graph and in each color class, etc). The connectivity of color classes
is also addressed. Most results in the literature on amalgamations focus on the
disentangling of amalgamated complete graphs and complete multipartite graphs.
Many such results follow as immediate corollaries to the main result in this
paper, which addresses amalgamations of graphs in general, allowing for example
the final graph to have multiple edges. A new corollary of the main theorem is
the settling of the existence of Hamilton decompositions of the family of
graphs $K(a_1,\dots, a_p;\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$; such graphs arose naturally in
statistical settings.

the result of a modulation doping effect in which carriers are transferred from

first-principles calculations and model analysis to elucidate the various

assess the power of an A/B test when the units in the study are exposed to
interference? This question is germane to many scientific and industrial
practitioners that rely on A/B testing in environments where control over
interference is limited. We begin by proving that interference has a measurable
effect on its sensitivity, or power. We quantify the power of an A/B test of
equality of means as a function of the number of exposed individuals under any
interference mechanism. We further derive a central limit theorem for the
number of exposed individuals under a simple Bernoulli switching interference
mechanism. Based on these results, we develop a strategy to estimate the power
of an A/B test when actors experience interference according to an observed
network model. We demonstrate how to leverage this theory to estimate the power
of an A/B test on units sharing any network relationship, and highlight the
utility of our method on two applications - a Facebook friendship network as
well as a large Twitter follower network. These results yield, for the first
time, the capacity to understand how to design an A/B test to detect, with a
specified confidence, a fixed measurable treatment effect when the A/B test is
conducted under interference driven by networks.

attacks and design more resilient control protocols. To this end, we will take
the role of the attacker to identify the worst effects of attacks on root nodes

that a stealthy attack on root nodes can mislead the entire network to a wrong
understanding of the situation and even destabilize the synchronization

will intensify the urgency of designing novel control protocols to mitigate

liquids on a flat and a spherical rough and textured substrate is theoretically
studied in the capillary-controlled spreading regime. A droplet whose scale is
much larger than that of the roughness of substrate is considered. The
equilibrium contact angle on a rough substrate is modeled by the Wenzel and the
Cassie-Baxter model. Only the viscous energy dissipation within the droplet
volume is considered, and that within the texture of substrate by imbibition is
neglected. Then, the energy balance approach is adopted to derive the evolution
equation of the contact angle. When the equilibrium contact angle vanishes, the
relaxation of dynamic contact angle $\theta$ of a droplet obeys a power law
decay $\theta \sim t^{-\alpha}$ except for the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian
shear-thinning liquid of the Wenzel model on a spherical substrate. The
spreading exponent $\alpha$ of the non-Newtonian shear-thickening liquid of the
Wenzel model on a spherical substrate is larger than others. The relaxation of
the Newtonian liquid of the Wenzel model on a spherical substrate is even
faster showing the exponential relaxation. The relaxation of the non-Newtonian
shear-thinning liquid of Wenzel model on a spherical substrate is fastest and
finishes within a finite time. Thus, the topography (roughness) and the
topology (flat to spherical) of substrate accelerate the spreading of droplet.

formulates for the first time, a unified kinetic theory in which collective
processes and collisional dynamics are systematically incorporated from first
principles. One of the outcomes of such a formalism is the rigorous derivation
of collisional damping rates for Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves, which can be
contrasted to the heuristic customary approach. However, the results are given
only in formal mathematical expressions. The present Brief Communication
numerically evaluates the rigorous collisional damping rates by considering the
case of plasma particles with Maxwellian velocity distribution function so as
to assess the consequence of the rigorous formalism in a quantitative manner.
Comparison with the heuristic (""Spitzer"") formula shows that the accurate
damping rates are much lower in magnitude than the conventional expression,
which implies that the traditional approach over-estimates the importance of
attenuation of plasma waves by collisional relaxation process. Such a finding
may have a wide applicability ranging from laboratory to space and

this deficit, we consider the problem of inferring Boolean non-Markovian
rewards (also known as logical trace properties or specifications) from
demonstrations provided by an agent operating in an uncertain, stochastic
environment. Crucially, specifications admit well-defined composition rules
that are typically easy to interpret. In this paper, we formulate the
specification inference task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability
inference problem, apply the principle of maximum entropy to derive an analytic

2017 May 21 at a distance 16.09 au from the Sun, the second most distant
discovery of an active comet. Pre-discovery images in the PS1 archive back to
2014 and additional deep CFHT images between 2013 May 10-13 showed the comet to
be active at 23.75 au. We derive an upper limit to the nucleus radius of
$R_N$=80 km, assuming a 4\% albedo. The spectral reflectivity of the comet
surface is similar to ""fresh"" regions seen on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
using the $Rosetta$ OSIRIS camera. Pre-discovery photometry combined with new
data obtained with Megacam on the CFHT show that the activity is consistent
with CO-ice sublimation and inconsistent with CO$_2$-ice sublimation. The ice
sublimation models were run out to perihelion in 2022 at 1.8 au to predict the
CO production rates, assuming that the outgassing area does not change.
Assuming a canonical 4\% active surface area for water-ice sublimation, we
present production rate ratios, $Q_{\rm CO}$/$Q_{\rm H2O}$, for a range of
nucleus sizes. Comparing these results with other CO-rich comets we derive a
lower limit to the nucleus radius of $\sim$14 km. We present predictions for
$Q_{\rm CO}$ at a range of distances that will be useful for planning
observations with JWST and large ground-based facilities.

and hence the dynamics of continents. However, the coverage of heat flow
measurements is still poor in many continental areas. By transforming the
stable nonlinear heat conduction equation into a Poisson's one, we develop a
method to infer surface heat flow for a stable or quasi-stable continent from a
Parker's-like formula. This formula provides the relationship between the
Fourier transform of surface heat flow and the sum of the Fourier transform of
the powers of geometry for the heat production (HP) interface in the
continental lithosphere. Once the interface geometry is known, one to three
dimensional distribution of the surface heat flow can be calculated accurately
by this formula. As a case study, we estimate the three-dimensional surface
heat flows for the Ordos geological block and its adjacent areas in China on a
$1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ grid based on a simple layered constant HP model.
Comparing to the measurements, most relative errors of the heat flows inferred
are less than 20\%, showing this method is a favorable way to estimate surface
heat flow for stable or quasi-stable continental regions where measurements are

$\rho_{00}$ from 1/3. We also show that a finite $\eta$ and $p_T$ coverage
affect the extracted $p_H$ parameter for $\Lambda$ hyperons when the real $p_H$
value is non-zero. Therefore proper corrections are necessary to reliably
quantify the global polarization with experimental observables.

connections on $V$, we prove that, if $E$ is a generic fiber, the restricted
sequence $\Xi_i|_{E}$ converges to a flat connection $A_0$. Furthermore, if the
restriction $V|_E$ is of the form $\oplus_{j=1}^n\mathcal O_E(q_j-0)$ for $n$
distinct points $q_j\in E$, then these points uniquely determine $A_0$.

the dark filamentary clouds associated with IC5146. The data allow us to
investigate the dust properties (this paper) and the magnetic field structure
(Paper II). A total of 2022 background stars were detected in $R_{c}$-, $i'$-,
$H$-, and/or $K$-bands to $A_V \lesssim 25$ mag. The ratio of the polarization
percentage at different wavelengths provides an estimate of $\lambda_{max}$,
the wavelength of peak polarization, which is an indicator of the small-size
cutoff of the grain size distribution. The grain size distribution seems to
significantly change at $A_V \sim$ 3 mag, where both the average and dispersion
of $P_{R_c}/P_{H}$ decrease. In addition, we found $\lambda_{max}$ $\sim$
0.6-0.9 $\mu$m for $A_V>2.5$ mag, which is larger than the $\sim$ 0.55 $\mu$m
in the general ISM, suggesting that grain growth has already started in low
$A_V$ regions. Our data also reveal that polarization efficiency (PE $\equiv
P_{\lambda}/A_V$) decreases with $A_V$ as a power-law in $R_c$-, $i'$-, and
$K$-bands with indices of -0.71$\pm$0.10, -1.23$\pm$0.10 and -0.53$\pm$0.09.
However, $H$-band data show a power index change; the PE varies with $A_V$
steeply (index of -0.95$\pm$0.30) when $A_V < 2.88\pm0.67$ mag but softly
(index of -0.25$\pm$0.06) for greater $A_V$ values. The soft decay of PE in
high $A_V$ regions is consistent with the Radiative Aligned Torque model,
suggesting that our data trace the magnetic field to $A_V \sim 20$ mag.
Furthermore, the breakpoint found in $H$-band is similar to the $A_V$ where we
found the $P_{R_c}/P_{H}$ dispersion significantly decreased. Therefore, the
flat PE-$A_V$ in high $A_V$ regions implies that the power index changes result
from additional grain growth.

planetary dynamics studies is an expansion of the gravitational interaction of
the three-body problem with respect to zero eccentricity and zero inclination.
This restricts its validity to nearly coplanar orbits. Motivated by the
dynamical study of asteroids, Centaurs and transneptunian objects with
arbitrary inclinations, we derive a series expansion of the gravitational
interaction with respect to an arbitrary reference inclination that generalises
our work on the polar and retrograde disturbing functions. The new disturbing
function, like the polar one, may model any resonance as expansion order is
unrelated to resonance order. The powers of eccentricity and inclination of the
force amplitude of a $p$:$q$ resonance depend only on the parity of the
resonance order $|p-q|$. Disturbing functions with non zero reference
inclinations are thus physically different from the classical disturbing
function as the former are based on the three-dimensional three-body problem
and the latter on the two-dimensional one. We illustrate the use of the new
disturbing function by showing that what is known as pure eccentricity
resonances are intrinsically dependent on inclination contrary to the
prediction of the classical disturbing function. We determine the inclination
dependence of the resonance widths of the 2:1 and 3:1 prograde and retrograde
inner resonances with Jupiter as well as those of the asymmetric librations of
the 1:2 and 1:3 prograde outer resonances with Neptune.

is beyond our ability to test the effects of quantum gravity thorough the

elegant alternative scheme to test such theories by detecting the deformations
emerging from the noncommutative structures. Our protocol relies on the novelty
of an opto-mechanical experimental setup where the information of the
noncommutative oscillator is exchanged via the interaction with an optical
pulse inside an optical cavity. We also demonstrate that our proposal is within

demonstrate its use in checking the consistency of properties across semantics
by applying it to a set of representative programs, and highlighting a
deadlock-related discrepancy between the principal execution models of SCOOP.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the extensibility of the workbench by generalising
the formalisation of an execution model to support recently proposed extensions
for distributed programming. Our workbench is based on a modular and
parameterisable graph transformation semantics implemented in the GROOVE tool.
We discuss how graph transformations are leveraged to atomically model
intricate language abstractions, how the visual yet algebraic nature of the
model can be used to ascertain soundness, and highlight how the approach could
be applied to similar languages.

the interaction between segregants and GBs is crucial for understanding the
properties of nanocrystalline materials. In this study, we have systematically
investigated the tendency of Pt to segregate as well as the interaction between
Pt and oxygen vacancies at the sigma 3/(111) GB of ceria (CeO2). The Pt atom
has a stronger tendency to segregate to the sigma 3/(111) GB than to the (111)
and (110) free-standing surfaces, but the tendency is weaker than to the (100)
free-standing surface. Mechanic contributions (lattice distortion) play a
dominant role in the strong tendency of Pt to segregate. At the
Pt-segregated-GB (Pt@GB), oxygen vacancies prefer to form spontaneously near Pt
in the GB region. However, at the pristine GB (no Pt and no vacancies), oxygen
vacancies form only under O-poor conditions. Thus, Pt segregation to the GB
promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, and their strong interactions
enhance the interfacial cohesion. We propose that GBs fabricated close to the
surfaces of nanocrystalline ceria can trap Pt from the bulk or other types of
surface, resulting in the suppression of the accumulation of Pt on the surface
under redox reactions, especially under O-poor conditions.

  In infinite combinatorics cardinality is often an overly rough measure to

for such a result is the generalization of Menger's theorem to infinite

contains a system $ \mathcal{R}_v $ of internally disjoint $ r\rightarrow v $
paths such that the ingoing edges of $ v $ in $ E $ are exactly the last edges
of the paths in $ \mathcal{R}_v $. Furthermore, the path-system $ \mathcal{R}_v

many kinds of periodic traveling wave solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs. They
turned out to depend in a crucial way on the negative signature of the Hessian
matrix of action integrals associated with those waves. In a previous paper
(Nonlinearity 2016), the authors addressed the characterization of stability of
periodic waves for a rather large class of Hamiltonian partial differential
equations that includes quasilinear generalizations of the Korteweg--de Vries
equation and dispersive perturbations of the Euler equations for compressible
fluids, either in Lagrangian or in Eulerian coordinates. They derived a
sufficient condition for orbital stability with respect to co-periodic
perturbations, and a necessary condition for spectral stability, both in terms
of the negative signature - or Morse index - of the Hessian matrix of the
action integral. Here the asymptotic behavior of this matrix is investigated in
two asymptotic regimes, namely for small amplitude waves and for waves
approaching a solitary wave as their wavelength goes to infinity. The special
structure of the matrices involved in the expansions makes possible to actually
compute the negative signature of the action Hessian both in the harmonic limit
and in the soliton limit. As a consequence, it is found that nondegenerate
small amplitude waves are orbitally stable with respect to co-periodic
perturbations in this framework. For waves of long wavelength, the negative
signature of the action Hessian is found to be exactly governed by the second
derivative with respect to the wave speed of the Boussinesq momentum associated
with the limiting solitary wave.

temperature of iron-based superconductors, their electronic structures have not
been studied much because of the lack of high-quality single crystals. In this
study, we completely determine the Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic state
of CaFeAsF, a 1111 iron-arsenide parent compound, by performing quantum
oscillation measurements and band-structure calculations. The determined Fermi
surface consists of a symmetry-related pair of Dirac electron cylinders and a
normal hole cylinder. From analyses of quantum-oscillation phases, we
demonstrate that the electron cylinders carry a nontrivial Berry phase $\pi$.
The carrier density is of the order of 10$^{-3}$ per Fe. This unusual metallic
state with the extremely small carrier density is a consequence of the
previously discussed topological feature of the band structure which prevents
the antiferromagnetic gap from being a full gap. We also report a nearly
linear-in-$B$ magnetoresistance and an anomalous resistivity increase above
about 30 T for $B \parallel c$, the latter of which is likely related to the
quantum limit of the electron orbit. Intriguingly, the electrical resistivity
exhibits a nonmetallic temperature dependence in the paramagnetic tetragonal
phase ($T >$ 118 K), which may suggest an incoherent state. Our study provides
a detailed knowledge of the Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic state of
1111 parent compounds and moreover opens up a new possibility to explore
Dirac-fermion physics in those compounds.

physical properties of the predicted scene such as intersecting objects or
objects in unstable positions. In this work, we enhance the accuracy and
stability of estimated poses for a whole scene by enforcing these physical
constraints over time through the integration of a physics simulation. This

particularly important when members are known to suffer from disproportion
health issues or to pose health risks to the larger ambient population in which
they are embedded. Efforts to derive size estimates are often frustrated by a
range of factors that preclude conventional survey strategies, including social
stigma associated with group membership or members' involvement in illegal
activities.
  This paper extends prior research on the problem of network population size
estimation, building on established survey/sampling methodologies commonly used
with hard-to-reach groups. Three novel one-step, network-based population size
estimators are presented, to be used in the context of uniform random sampling,
respondent-driven sampling, and when networks exhibit significant clustering
effects. Provably sufficient conditions for the consistency of these estimators
(in large configuration networks) are given. Simulation experiments across a
wide range of synthetic network topologies validate the performance of the
estimators, which are seen to perform well on a real-world location-based
social networking data set with significant clustering. Finally, the proposed
schemes are extended to allow them to be used in settings where participant
anonymity is required. Systematic experiments show favorable tradeoffs between
anonymity guarantees and estimator performance.
  Taken together, we demonstrate that reasonable population estimates can be
derived from anonymous respondent driven samples of 250-750 individuals, within
ambient populations of 5,000-40,000. The method thus represents a novel and
cost-effective means for health planners and those agencies concerned with
health and disease surveillance to estimate the size of hidden populations.
Limitations and future work are discussed in the concluding section.

hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to
automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture
highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However,
deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because
its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep

Or, should we resist a 'black-box' solution? There are controversial opinions
in the remote sensing community. In this article, we analyze the challenges of
using deep learning for remote sensing data analysis, review the recent
advances, and provide resources to make deep learning in remote sensing
ridiculously simple to start with. More importantly, we advocate remote sensing
scientists to bring their expertise into deep learning, and use it as an
implicit general model to tackle unprecedented large-scale influential
challenges, such as climate change and urbanization.

seemingly unrelated processes, one from computational geometry and the other
from differential geometry. The first one (which we call ""grid peeling"") is the
convex-layer decomposition of subsets $G\subset \mathbb Z^2$ of the integer
grid, previously studied for the particular case $G=\{1,\ldots,m\}^2$ by
Har-Peled and Lidick\'y (2013). The second one is the affine curve-shortening
flow (ACSF), first studied by Alvarez et al. (1993) and Sapiro and Tannenbaum
(1993). We present empirical evidence that, in a certain well-defined sense,
grid peeling behaves at the limit like ACSF on convex curves. We offer some
theoretical arguments in favor of this conjecture.
  We also pay closer attention to the simple case where $G=\mathbb N^2$ is a
quarter-infinite grid. This case corresponds to ACSF starting with an infinite
L-shaped curve, which when transformed using the ACSF becomes a hyperbola for
all times $t>0$. We prove that, in the grid peeling of $\mathbb N^2$, (1) the
number of grid points removed up to iteration $n$ is $\Theta(n^{3/2}\log n)$;
and (2) the boundary at iteration $n$ is sandwiched between two hyperbolas that
are separated from each other by a constant factor.

carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) driven by gravitational wave radiation, is
one of the classical pathways for the formation of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).
Recently, it has been proposed that the WD+He subgiant channel has a
significant contribution to the production of massive double WDs, in which the
primary WD accumulates mass by accreting He-rich matter from a He subgiant. We
evolved about 1800 CO WD+He star systems and obtained a large and dense grid
for producing SNe Ia through the DD model. We then performed a series of binary
population synthesis simulations for the DD model, in which the WD+He subgiant
channel is calculated by interpolations in this grid. According to our standard
model, the Galactic birthrate of SNe Ia is about 2.4*10^{-3} yr^{-1} for the
WD+He subgiant channel of the DD model; the total birthrate is about
3.7*10^{-3} yr^{-1} for all channels, reproducing that of observations.
Previous theoretical models still have deficit with the observed SNe Ia with
delay times <1 Gyr and >8 Gyr. After considering the WD+He subgiant channel, we
found that the delay time distributions is comparable with the observed
results. Additionally, some recent studies proposed that the violent WD mergers
are more likely to produce SNe Ia based on the DD model. We estimated that the
violent mergers through the DD model may only contribute to about 16% of all
SNe Ia.

A red-giant (RG) star has been suggested to be the mass donor of the exploding
WD, named as the symbiotic channel. However, previous studies on the this
channel gave a relatively low rate of SNe Ia. Aims. We aim to systematically
investigate the parameter space, Galactic rates and delay time distributions of
SNe Ia from the symbiotic channel by employing a revised mass-transfer
prescription. Methods. We adopted an integrated mass-transfer prescription to
calculate the mass-transfer process from a RG star onto the WD. In this
prescription, the mass-transfer rate varies with the local material states.
Results. We evolved a large number of WD+RG systems, and found that the
parameter space of WD+RG systems for producing SNe Ia is significantly
enlarged. This channel could produce SNe Ia with intermediate and old ages,
contributing to at most 5% of all SNe Ia in the Galaxy. Our model increases the
SN Ia rate from this channel by a factor of 5. We suggest that the symbiotic
systems RS Oph and T CrB are strong candidates for the progenitors of SNe Ia.

sufficiently regular distributions $\lambda \sim 1/N$, while for strong
fluctuations of the frequency spacing, $\lambda \sim \ln N/N$ (the standard
setup of independent identically distributed variables belongs to the latter

a rigorous perturbative theory is not obvious. In fact, our analysis relies on
a combination of various types of numerical simulations together with
approximate analytical arguments, based on a suitable stochastic approximation
for the tangent space evolution. In fact, the very reason for $\lambda$ being
strictly larger than zero is the presence of finite size fluctuations. We trace
back the origin of the logarithmic correction to a weak synchronization between

rotations in phase space, which commute with computations in the codespace

This encoding scheme can thus be applied to any computation with coherent state
inputs, and the computation proceeds via a combination of passive linear optics
and generalized non-linear phase operations. An example of such a computation
is matrix multiplication, whereby a vector representing coherent state
amplitudes is multiplied by a matrix representing a linear optics network,
yielding a new vector of coherent state amplitudes. By finding an orthogonal
partitioning of the support of our encoded states, we quantify the security of
our scheme via the indistinguishability of the encrypted codewords. Whilst we
focus on coherent state encodings, we expect that this phase-key encoding
technique could apply to any continuous-variable computation scheme where the

method, called concentric MacLaurin spheroid (CMS), to calculate with very high
accuracy the gravitational moments of a rotating fluid body following a
barotropic pressure-density relationship. Having such an accurate method is of
great importance for taking full advantage of the Juno mission, and its
extremely precise determination of Jupiter gravitational moments, to better
constrain the internal structure of the planet. Recently, several authors have
applied this method to the Juno mission with 512 spheroids linearly spaced in
altitude. We demonstrate in this paper that such calculations lead to errors
larger than Juno's error bars, invalidating the aforederived Jupiter models at
the level required by Juno's precision. We show that, in order to fulfill
Juno's observational constraints, at least 1500 spheroids must be used with a
cubic, square or exponential repartition, the most reliable solutions. When
using a realistic equation of state instead of a polytrope, we highlight the
necessity to properly describe the outermost layers to derive an accurate
boundary condition, excluding in particular a zero pressure outer condition.
Providing all these constraints are fulfilled, the CMS method can indeed be
used to derive Jupiter models within Juno's present observational constraints.
However, we show that the treatment of the outermost layers leads to
irreducible errors in the calculation of the gravitational moments and thus on
the inferred physical quantities for the planet. We have quantified these
errors and evaluated the maximum precision that can be reached with the CMS
method in the present and future exploitation of Juno's data.

regularization parameters in a data-adaptive manner. Another advantage of our
algorithm is that it provides an overview on the solution stability over the
whole range of parameters. This can be further exploited to obtain additional
insights into the problem of interest. We provide a numerical analysis of our

starting from the noisy signal by minimizing a chosen distortion measure, which
results in an estimate that depends on the unknown clean signal or its

practice, one has to estimate the clean signal statistics. In this paper, we
develop a new risk minimization framework for speech enhancement, in which, one
optimizes an unbiased estimate of the distortion/risk instead of the actual
risk. The estimated risk is expressed solely as a function of the noisy
observations. We consider several perceptually relevant distortion measures and
develop corresponding unbiased estimates under realistic assumptions on the
noise distribution and a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Minimizing the
risk estimates gives rise to the corresponding denoisers, which are nonlinear
functions of the a posteriori SNR. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ), average segmental SNR (SSNR) computations, and listening tests show
that the proposed risk optimization approach employing Itakura-Saito and
weighted hyperbolic cosine distortions gives better performance than the other

superior denoising performance over the benchmark techniques based on the

give compositional semantics to sequential programs. RCRS allows to specify
both safety and liveness properties. It also allows to model input-output
systems which are both non-deterministic and non-input-receptive (i.e., which
may reject some inputs at some points in time), and can thus be seen as a
behavioral type system. RCRS provides a set of techniques for symbolic
computer-aided reasoning, including compositional static analysis and
verification. RCRS comes with a publicly available implementation which
includes a complete formalization of the RCRS theory in the Isabelle proof
assistant.

relations of NSs and QSs do not exceed causality restrictions because the
compactness of NS and QS are saturated after passing certain large critical
value. This observation is in agreement with the results obtained in
Ref.\cite{Delsate12} for the case of pressure-less stars. We have also found
that if $\kappa$ larger than certain non-zero value, the CIDDM with vector

$M_\odot$. We have found also that if the NS or QS EOS becomes stiffer, the
upper limit of $\kappa$ from compactness constraint becomes smaller and lower
limit of $\kappa$ from maximum masses constraint becomes larger. We also
observe that the uncertainty of the systematic in canonical mass compact stars

We show that for curved emitter tips, the current density can be accurately
computed if terms involving $(\Delta s/R_2)^2$ and $(\Delta s/R_2)^3$ are
incorporated in the potential where $R_2$ is the second (smaller) principle
radius of curvature. The result is established analytically for the

demonstrated numerically for an emitter with a conical base and quadratic tip.

Functional Theory study on the structural and electronic properties of QFMLG
with defects in the H coverage arranged in different configurations including
up to 13 vacant H atoms, and show that these generate localized electronic
states with specific electronic structure. Based on the comparison of simulated

size (7-13 missing H) to the different observed features. The presence of large
vacancies is in agreement with the tendency of single H vacancies to aggregate,
as demonstrated here by DFT results. This gives some hints into the
hydrogenation process. Our work unravels the structural diversity of defects of
H coverage in QFMLG and provides operative ways to interpret the variety in the

tunable by means of their size and shape, suggesting applications in nano- and

bibliometric methods a bibliometrician will always highlight particular
elements of publications, and through these elements operationalize particular

view. Understanding bibliometrics as representation implies that a bibliometric
analysis is always performative: a bibliometric analysis brings a particular
representation of science into being that potentially influences the science
system itself. In this review we analyze the ways the humanities have been
represented throughout the history of bibliometrics, often in comparison to
other scientific domains or to a general notion of the sciences. Our review
discusses bibliometric scholarship between 1965 and 2016 that studies the
humanities empirically. We distinguish between two periods of bibliometric
scholarship. The first period, between 1965 and 1989, is characterized by a
sociological theoretical framework, the development and use of the Price index,
and small samples of journal publications as data sources. The second period,
from the mid-1980s up until the present day, is characterized by a new
hinterland, that of science policy and research evaluation, in which
bibliometric methods become embedded.

within a velocity offset of 5000 km/s relative to the background quasar are
mostly associated with the quasar itself, whereas the absorbers seen at larger
velocity offsets towards us are intervening absorber systems and hence their
existence is completely independent of the background quasar. Recent evidence
by Bergeron et al. (2011, hereinafter BBM) has seriously questioned this
paradigm, by showing that the number density of intervening MgII absorbers
towards the 45 blazars in their sample is nearly 2 times the expectation based
on the MgII absorption systems seen towards normal QSOs. Given its serious
implications, it becomes important to revisit this finding, by enlarging the
blazar sample and subjecting it to an independent analysis. Here, we first
report the outcome of our re-analysis of the available spectroscopic data for
the BBM sample itself. Our analysis of the BBM sample reproduces their claimed
factor of 2 excess of dN/dz along blazar sightlines, vis-a-vis normal QSOs. We
have also assembled a ~3 times larger sample of blazars, albeit with moderately
sensitive optical spectra. Using this sample together with the BBM sample, our
analysis shows that the dN/dz of the MgII absorbers statistically matches that
known for normal QSO sightlines. Further, the analysis indicates that
associated absorbers might be contributing significantly to the estimated dN/dz
upto offset speeds \Delta v ~0.2c relative to the blazar.

correct reaction rates in the isotropic case within an average error of $\sim$
7%. We apply this formalism to gamma rays flying downward or upward from a hot

temperatures can be easily deduced using the relevant scaling laws. We find
differences in absorption between these two extreme directions of almost two
orders of magnitude, much larger than our error estimate. The magnetosphere

experiments, biologists measure the fluorescence emission of treated cells and
compare them with their natural emission to study the presence of specific
molecules on the cells' surface. They observe a signal which is composed of a
noise (the natural fluorescence) plus some additional signal related to the
quantity of molecule present on the surface if any. From a statistical point of
view, we aim at inferring the percentage of cells expressing the selected
molecule and the probability distribution function associated with its
fluorescence emission. We propose here an adap-tive estimation procedure based
on a previous deconvolution procedure introduced by [vEGS08, GvES11]. For both
estimating the mixing parameter and the mixing density automatically, we use
the Lepskii method based on the optimal choice of a bandwidth using a
bias-variance decomposition. We then derive some concentration inequalities for
our estimators and obtain the convergence rates, that are shown to be minimax
optimal (up to some log terms) in Sobolev classes. Finally, we apply our
algorithm on simulated and real biological data.

astrophysical sources will be a major advancement in identifying and
understanding the sources of UHE cosmic rays (CRs) in nature. Long duration
gamma-ray burst (GRB) blast waves have been considered as potential
acceleration sites of UHECRs. These CRs are expected to interact with GRB
afterglow photons, which is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons
co-accelerated with CRs in the blast wave, and naturally produce UHE neutrinos.
Fluxes of these neutrinos are uncertain, however, and crucially depend on the
observed afterglow modeling. We have selected a sample of 23 long duration GRBs
within redshift 0.5 for which adequate electromagnetic afterglow data are
available and which could produce high flux of UHE afterglow neutrinos, being
nearby. We fit optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray afterglow data with an adiabatic
blast wave model in a constant density interstellar medium and in a wind
environment where the density of the wind decreases as inverse square of the
radius from the center of the GRB. The blast wave model parameters extracted
from these fits are then used for calculating UHECR acceleration and $p\gamma$
interactions to produce UHE neutrino fluxes from these GRBs. We have also
explored the detectability of these neutrinos by currently running and upcoming
large area neutrino detectors, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube
Gen-2 and KM3NeT observatories. We find that our realistic flux models from
nearby GRBs will be unconstrained in foreseeable future.

methods have been widely studied in image denoising. However, these methods
mostly learn a specific model for each noise level, and require multiple models
for denoising images with different noise levels. They also lack flexibility to
deal with spatially variant noise, limiting their applications in practical
denoising. To address these issues, we present a fast and flexible denoising
convolutional neural network, namely FFDNet, with a tunable noise level map as
the input. The proposed FFDNet works on downsampled sub-images, achieving a
good trade-off between inference speed and denoising performance. In contrast
to the existing discriminative denoisers, FFDNet enjoys several desirable
properties, including (i) the ability to handle a wide range of noise levels
(i.e., [0, 75]) effectively with a single network, (ii) the ability to remove
spatially variant noise by specifying a non-uniform noise level map, and (iii)
faster speed than benchmark BM3D even on CPU without sacrificing denoising
performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real noisy images are
conducted to evaluate FFDNet in comparison with state-of-the-art denoisers. The
results show that FFDNet is effective and efficient, making it highly
attractive for practical denoising applications.

from Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) computed from daily climatological

velocities are produced by a submesoscale permitting regional ocean model of
the Gulf of Mexico. The significance of the climatological LCSs (cLCSs) is
supported with ensemble-mean drifter density evolutions from simulated and
historical satellite-tracked drifter trajectories. A persistent attracting
barrier between the NWGoM shelf and the deep ocean is effectively identified by
a hook-like pattern associated with groups of overall strongly attracting cLCSs
that extend along the shelf break. Localized reductions in the attraction rate
along these overall strongly attracting cLCSs proximal to cross-shore oriented
cLCSs identify a pathway for potential transport across the shelf break. Groups
of overall weakly-attracting cLCSs are not seen to strongly constrain material
transport. Tracers originating over the shelf tend to be trapped there by the
hook-like pattern as they spread cyclonically. Tracers originating beyond the
shelf tend to be initially attracted to the hook-like pattern as they spread
anti-cyclonically and eventually over the deep ocean. The findings have
important implications for the mitigation of contaminant accidents such as oil
spills.

users to interactively label content regions as well as line structures. Image
resizing can then be achieved by warping the image by an orientation-preserving
bijective warping map with controlled distortion. The warping map is
represented by its Beltrami representation, which captures the local geometric
distortion of the map. By carefully prescribing the values of the Beltrami
representation, images with different complexity can be effectively resized.
Our method does not require solving any optimization problems and tuning

with variable dielectric permittivity, based on a parabolic equation with
singular nonlinearity. We study the touchdown or quenching phenomenon.
Recently, the question whether or not touchdown can occur at zero points of the
permittivity profile, which had long remained open, was answered negatively by
Guo and Souplet for the case of interior points, and we then showed that
touchdown can actually be ruled out in subregions of the domain where the
permittivity is positive but suitably small.
  The goal of this paper is to further investigate the touchdown localization
problem and to show that, in one space dimension, one can obtain quite
quantitative conditions. Namely, for large classes of typical, one-bump and
two-bump permittivity profiles, we find good lower estimates of the ratio
between f and its maximum, below which no touchdown occurs outside of the
bumps. The ratio is rigorously obtained as the solution of a suitable
finite-dimensional optimization problem (with either three or four parameters),
which is then numerically estimated. Rather surprisingly, it turns out that the
values of the ratio are not ""small"" but actually up to the order 0.3, which
could hence be quite appropriate for robust use in practical MEMS design.
  The main tool for the reduction to the finite-dimensional optimization
problem is a quantitative type I, temporal touchdown estimate. The latter is
proved by maximum principle arguments, applied to a multi-parameter family of
refined, nonlinear auxiliary functions with cut-off.

The findings show that customer need pivot is the most common among all pivot

pivots. The major product related pivots are zoom-in and technology pivots.
Several new pivot types were identified, including market zoom-in, complete and

approximation the Berry curvature has a delta function singularity at the
conical intersection of the potential energy surfaces, the exact Berry
curvature is a smooth peaked function. Numerical calculations revealed that the
characteristic width of the peak is $\hbar K^{1/2}/gM^{1/2}$, where $M$ is the
mass associated with the relevant nuclear coordinates, $K$ is the effective
internuclear spring constant and $g$ is the electronic-vibrational coupling.
This result is confirmed here by an asymptotic analysis of the

a separation of length scales. Being based on the exact electron-nuclear

demonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In
addition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the
lack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes. To address these
problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for interactive
segmentation by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based
segmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine-tuning to make a CNN
model adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised
(without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional
scribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and
interaction-based uncertainty for the fine-tuning. We applied this framework to
two applications: 2D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal MR slices,
where only two types of these organs were annotated for training; and 3D
segmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor
(including edema) from different MR sequences, where only tumor cores in one MR
sequence were annotated for training. Experimental results show that 1) our
model is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art
CNNs; 2) image-specific fine-tuning with the proposed weighted loss function
significantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to
accurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than
traditional interactive segmentation methods.

Restricted Boltzmann Machines and some classes of Tensor-Network states in
arbitrary dimensions. In particular we demonstrate that short-range Restricted
Boltzmann Machines are Entangled Plaquette States, while fully connected
Restricted Boltzmann Machines are String-Bond States with a nonlocal geometry
and low bond dimension. These results shed light on the underlying architecture
of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their efficiency at representing many-body
quantum states. String-Bond States also provide a generic way of enhancing the
power of Neural-Network Quantum States and a natural generalization to systems
with larger local Hilbert space. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of
these different classes of states and present a method to combine them
together. This allows us to benefit from both the entanglement structure of
Tensor Networks and the efficiency of Neural-Network Quantum States into a
single Ansatz capable of targeting the wave function of strongly correlated
systems. While it remains a challenge to describe states with chiral
topological order using traditional Tensor Networks, we show that
Neural-Network Quantum States and their String-Bond States extension can
describe a lattice Fractional Quantum Hall state exactly. In addition, we
provide numerical evidence that Neural-Network Quantum States can approximate a

calculate the mass inflow rate due to magnetic stress of the bar to 7.1 solar

length of the magnetic field in the centre is similar to the size of giant

pre-determined groupings of fMRI measurement voxels. Earlier, we have
demonstrated that the functional homogeneity of ROIs, captured by their spatial
consistency, varies widely across ROIs in commonly-used brain atlases. Here, we
ask how ROIs behave as nodes of dynamic brain networks. To this end, we use two
measures: spatiotemporal consistency measures changes in spatial consistency
across time and network turnover quantifies the changes in the local network
structure around a ROI. We find that spatial consistency varies non-uniformly
in space and time, which is reflected in the variation of spatiotemporal
consistency across ROIs. Further, we see time-dependent changes in the network
neighborhoods of the ROIs, reflected in high network turnover. Network turnover
is nonuniformly distributed across ROIs: ROIs with high spatiotemporal
consistency have low network turnover. Finally, we reveal that there is rich
voxel-level correlation structure inside ROIs. Because the internal structure
and the connectivity of ROIs vary in time, the common approach of using static
node definitions may be surprisingly inaccurate. Therefore, network
neuroscience would greatly benefit from node definition strategies tailored for

local regression function while enforcing consensus constraints. We use a
penalized variant of functional stochastic gradient descent operating
simultaneously with low-dimensional subspace projections. These subspaces are
constructed greedily by applying orthogonal matching pursuit to the sequence of
kernel dictionaries and weights. By tuning the projection-induced bias, we
propose an algorithm that allows for each individual agent to learn, based upon
its locally observed data stream and message passing with its neighbors only, a
regression function that is close to the globally optimal regression function.
That is, we establish that with constant step-size selections agents' functions
converge to a neighborhood of the globally optimal one while satisfying the
consensus constraints as the penalty parameter is increased. Moreover, the
complexity of the learned regression functions is guaranteed to remain finite.
On both multi-class kernel logistic regression and multi-class kernel support

excesses in three identified flare footpoints are well correlated in time. We
examine the ratio of H${\alpha}$ to H${\beta}$ flare excess, which was proposed
by previous authors as a possible diagnostic of the level of electron beam
energy input. In the stronger footpoints, the typical value of the the
H${\alpha}$/H${\beta}$ intensity ratio observed is $\sim 0.4-0.5$, in broad
agreement with values obtained from a RADYN non-LTE simulation driven by an
electron beam with parameters constrained (as far as possible) by observation.
The weaker footpoint has a larger H${\alpha}$/H${\beta}$ ratio, again
consistent with a RADYN simulation but with a smaller energy flux. The
H${\alpha}$ line profiles observed have a less prominent central reversal than
is predicted by the RADYN results, but can be brought into agreement if the
H${\alpha}$-emitting material has a filling factor of around 0.2--0.3.

W-Streaming model with O(n polylog(n)) RAM, where n resp. m is the number of
nodes resp. edges of G. Our main result is the first one pass W-Streaming
algorithm computing an Euler tour of G in the form of an edge successor
function with only O(n log(n)) RAM which is optimal for this setting (e.g., Sun
and Woodruff (2015)). The previously best-known result in this model is
implicitly given by Demetrescu et al. (2010) with the parallel algorithm of
Atallah and Vishkin (1984) using O(m/n) passes under the same RAM limitation.
For graphs with \omega(n) edges this is non-constant. Our overall approach is
to partition the edges into edge-disjoint cycles and to merge the cycles until
a single Euler tour is achieved. Note that in the W-Streaming model such a
merging is far from being obvious as the limited RAM allows the processing of
only a constant number of cycles at once. This enforces us to merge cycles that
partially are no longer present in RAM. Furthermore, the successor of an edge
cannot be changed after the edge has left RAM. So, we steadily have to output
edges and their designated successors, not knowing the appearance of edges and
cycles yet to come. We solve this problem with a special edge swapping
technique, for which two certain edges per node are sufficient to merge tours
without having all of their edges in RAM. Mathematically, this is controlled by
structural results on the space of certain equivalence classes corresponding to
cycles and the characterization of associated successor functions. For example,
we give conditions under which the swapping of edge successors leads to a
merging of equivalence classes.

matched by their host galaxy properties, we study the spatially resolved
stellar kinematics and luminosity distributions at near-infrared wavelengths on
scales of 10-150 pc, using SINFONI on the VLT. In this paper, we present the
first half of the sample, which comprises 13 galaxies, 8 AGNs and 5 inactive
galaxies. The stellar velocity fields show a disk-like rotating pattern, for
which the kinematic position angle is in agreement with the photometric
position angle obtained from large scale images. For this set of galaxies, the
stellar surface brightness of the inactive galaxy sample is generally
comparable to the matched sample of AGN but extends to lower surface
brightness. After removal of the bulge contribution, we find a nuclear stellar
light excess with an extended nuclear disk structure, and which exhibits a
size-luminosity relation. While we expect the excess luminosity to be
associated with a dynamically cooler young stellar population, we do not
typically see a matching drop in dispersion. This may be because these galaxies
have pseudo-bulges in which the intrinsic dispersion increases towards the
centre. And although the young stars may have an impact in the observed
kinematics, their fraction is too small to dominate over the bulge and
compensate the increase in dispersion at small radii, so no dispersion drop is
seen. Finally, we find no evidence for a difference in the stellar kinematics
and nuclear stellar luminosity excess between these active and inactive
galaxies.

that often can be observed as a first step in biological processes. Despite its
inherent importance, still relatively little is known about the underlying
microscopic mechanisms. Here, using multivalent ions, we demonstrate the
control of the interactions and the corresponding adsorption of net-negatively
charged proteins (bovine serum albumin) at a solid-liquid interface. This is
demonstrated by ellipsometry and corroborated by neutron reflectivity and
quartz-crystal microbalance experiments. We show that the reentrant
condensation observed within the rich bulk phase behavior of the system
featuring a nonmonotonic dependence of the second virial cofficient on salt
concentration c_s is reflected in an intriguing way in the protein adsorption
d(c_s) at the interface. Our findings are successfully described and understood
by a model of ion-activated patchy interactions within the framework of
classical density functional theory. In addition to the general challenge of
connecting bulk and interface behavior, our work has implications for, inter
alia, nucleation at interfaces.

of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal
action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are
approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific
state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data,
especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we
have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical
interactions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how
far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we
investigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning
approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and
show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of
both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which
there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We
propose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or
organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model
and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and
prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large
real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture.
Compared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required
training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.

effects of quantum statistics, Coulomb interaction, and also indicate the role
of multi-body resonance decays and mini-jets. The characteristics of the one-,
two-, and three-dimensional correlation functions are studied as a function of
transverse pair momentum, $k_\text{T}$, and the charged-particle multiplicity
of the event. The extracted radii are in the range 1-5 fm, reaching highest
values for very high multiplicity pPb, also for similar multiplicity PbPb
collisions, and decrease with increasing $k_\text{T}$. The dependence of radii
on multiplicity and $k_\text{T}$ largely factorizes and appears to be

Recognizing that methods of artificial intelligence and Bayesian computation

interpretation and analysis of geophysical data, we derive a generalized
matrix-variate model of reflectivity in terms of orthogonal basis functions,
subject to sparse constraints. This supports a direct application of machine
learning methods, in a way that can be mapped back onto the physical principles
known to govern reflection seismology. As a demonstration we present an

control strategies for urban vector borne diseases. Consequently, there are
increasing concerns and interest in designing efficient strategies and
regulations that health agencies can follow in order to reduce the imminent
impact of viruses like Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya. That includes fumigation,
abatization, reducing the hatcheries, picking up trash, information campaigns.
A basic question that arise when designing control strategies is about which
and where these ones should focus. In other words, one would like to know
whether preventing the contagion or decrease vector population, and in which
area of the city, is more efficient. In this work, we propose risk indexes
based on the idea of secondary cases from patch to patch. Thus, they take into
account human mobility and indicate which patch has more chance to be a
corridor for the spread of the disease and which is more vulnerable. They can
also indicate the neighborhood where hatchery control will reduce more the
number of potential cases. In order to illustrate the usefulness of these
indexes, we run a set of numerical simulations in a mathematical model that
takes into account the urban mobility and the differences in population density
among the areas of a city. If i is a particular neighborhood, the transmission
risk index TR_i measures the potential secondary cases caused by a host in that
neighborhood. The vector transmission risk index VTR_i measures the potential
secondary cases caused by a vector. Finally, the vulnerability risk index VR_i
measures the potential secondary cases in the neighborhood. Transmission
indexes can be used to give geographical priority to some neighborhoods when
applying prevention and control measures. On the other hand, the vulnerability
index can be useful to implement monitoring campaigns or public health
investment.

processing. Event sequences, characterized by discrete observations stamped
with continuous-valued times of occurrence, are challenging due to the
potentially wide dynamic range of relevant time scales as well as interactions
between time scales. We describe four forms of inductive bias that should
benefit architectures for event sequences: temporal locality, position and
scale homogeneity, and scale interdependence. We extend the popular gated
recurrent unit (GRU) architecture to incorporate these biases via intrinsic
temporal dynamics, obtaining a continuous-time GRU. The CT-GRU arises by
interpreting the gates of a GRU as selecting a time scale of memory, and the
CT-GRU generalizes the GRU by incorporating multiple time scales of memory and
performing context-dependent selection of time scales for information storage
and retrieval. Event time-stamps drive decay dynamics of the CT-GRU, whereas
they serve as generic additional inputs to the GRU. Despite the very different
manner in which the two models consider time, their performance on eleven data
sets we examined is essentially identical. Our surprising results point both to
the robustness of GRU and LSTM architectures for handling continuous time, and
to the potency of incorporating continuous dynamics into neural architectures.

depends on the past and still accepts all the words in the language. The
motivation for GFG automata comes from their adequacy for games and synthesis,
wherein general nondeterminism is inappropriate. We continue the ongoing effort
of studying the power of nondeterminism in GFG automata. Initial indications
have hinted that every GFG automaton embodies a deterministic one. Today we
know that this is not the case, and in fact GFG automata may be exponentially
more succinct than deterministic ones.
  We focus on the typeness question, namely the question of whether a GFG
automaton with a certain acceptance condition has an equivalent GFG automaton
with a weaker acceptance condition on the same structure. Beyond the
theoretical interest in studying typeness, its existence implies efficient
translations among different acceptance conditions. This practical issue is of
special interest in the context of games, where the Buchi and co-Buchi
conditions admit memoryless strategies for both players. Typeness is known to
hold for deterministic automata and not to hold for general nondeterministic
automata.
  We show that GFG automata enjoy the benefits of typeness, similarly to the
case of deterministic automata. In particular, when Rabin or Streett GFG
automata have equivalent Buchi or co-Buchi GFG automata, respectively, then
such equivalent automata can be defined on a substructure of the original
automata. Using our typeness results, we further study the place of GFG
automata in between deterministic and nondeterministic ones. Specifically,
considering automata complementation, we show that GFG automata lean toward
nondeterministic ones, admitting an exponential state blow-up in the
complementation of a Streett automaton into a Rabin automaton, as opposed to
the constant blow-up in the deterministic case.

YouTube which were released from 1970-2017. The corpus contains csv files with
the following data about each movie - Wikipedia title of movie, cast, plot
text, co-referenced plot text, soundtrack information, link to movie poster,
caption of movie poster, number of males in poster, number of females in
poster. In addition to that, corresponding to each cast member the following

grating (FBG) sensors is historically known to offer the highest sensitivity
measurements, however, it has not been yet explored for {\pi}-phase-shifted FBG
({\pi}FBG) sensors. This, we believe, is due to the complex nature of the
reflection/transmission spectrum of a {\pi}FBG, which cannot be directly used
for interferometric interrogation purpose. Therefore, we propose here an
innovative as well as simple concept towards this direction, wherein, the
transmission spectrum of a {\pi}FBG sensor is optically filtered using a
specially designed fiber grating. The resulting filtered spectrum retains the
entire characteristics of a {\pi}FBG sensor and hence the filtered spectrum can
be interrogated with interferometric principles. Furthermore, due to the
extremely narrow transmission notch of a {\pi}FBG sensor, a fiber
interferometer can be realized with significantly longer path difference. This
leads to substantially enhanced detection limit as compared to sensors based on
a regular FBG of similar length. Theoretical analysis demonstrate that high
resolution weak dynamic strain measurement down to 4 p{\epsilon}/sqrt(Hz) is
easily achievable.

asteroid diameter $D$, we find that asteroids' Yarkovsky drift rates might have
a more complex size dependence than previous thought, leading to a curved
family V-shape boundary in semi-major axis, a, vs. 1/$D$ space. This implies
that asteroids are drifting faster at larger sizes than previously considered
decreasing on average the known ages of asteroid families. The V-Shape
curvature is determined for $>$25 families located throughout the Main Belt to
quantify the Yarkovsky size-dependent drift rate. We find that there is no
correlation between family age and V-shape curvature. In addition, the V-shape
curvature decreases for asteroid families with larger heliocentric distances
suggesting that the relationship between $\Gamma$ and $D$ is weaker in the
outer MB possibly due to homogenous surface roughness among family members.

configuration to focus broadband XUV radiation. Optimization of the focusing
optics alignment is carried out with the aid of an XUV wavefront sensor.
Back-propagation of the optimized wavefront to the focus yields a focal spot of
3.6$\times$4.0 $\mu$m$^2$ full width at half maximum, which is consistent with
ray-tracing simulations that predict a minimum size of 3.0$\times$3.2
$\mu$m$^2$. This work is important for optimizing the intensity of focused
high-order harmonics in order to reach the nonlinear interaction regime.

contour interferometer (DDCI), in application for the ultra sensitive detection
of magnetic flux and for digital read out of the state of the superconducting
flux qubit. DDCI consists of two superconducting contours weakly coupled by
Josephson Junctions. In such a device a change of the critical current and the
voltage happens in a step-like manner when the angular momentum quantum number
changes in one of the two contours. The DDCI may outperform traditional
Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices when the change of the quantum
number occurs in a narrow magnetic field region near the half of the flux
quantum due to thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations, or the switching a
loop segment in the normal state for a while by short pulse of an external
current.

  Detect Atrial Fibrillation Using Short Single-Lead ECG Recordings","Computing in Cardiology 2017",,,,"eess.SP cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of new technology such as wearables that record high-quality
single channel ECG, provides an opportunity for ECG screening in a larger
population, especially for atrial fibrillation screening. The main goal of this
study is to develop an automatic classification algorithm for normal sinus
rhythm (NSR), atrial fibrillation (AF), other rhythms (O), and noise from a
single channel short ECG segment (9-60 seconds). For this purpose, signal
quality index (SQI) along with dense convolutional neural networks was used.
Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models (main model that accepts 15
seconds ECG and secondary model that processes 9 seconds shorter ECG) were
trained using the training data set. If the recording is determined to be of
low quality by SQI, it is immediately classified as noisy. Otherwise, it is
transformed to a time-frequency representation and classified with the CNN as
NSR, AF, O, or noise. At the final step, a feature-based post-processing
algorithm classifies the rhythm as either NSR or O in case the CNN model's
discrimination between the two is indeterminate. The best result achieved at
the official phase of the PhysioNet/CinC challenge on the blind test set was
0.80 (F1 for NSR, AF, and O were 0.90, 0.80, and 0.70, respectively).

weak field limit, so that a linear approximation is adequate. Specializing to
static fields with spherical symmetry, we obtain a second-order equation for
one of the metric functions. We obtain the Green function for this equation,
and represent the metric function in the form of integrals over the source.
Near a compact source such as the Sun the solution no longer has Schwarzschild
form. Using Flanagan's method of obtaining a conformally invariant metric
tensor we attempt to get a solution of Schwarzschild type. We find, however,
that the 1/r terms disappear altogether. We conclude that a solution of
Mannheim type cannot exist for these field equations.

interpreted as self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates. We develop a
Newtonian model based on the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations for a complex
scalar field with a self-interaction potential $V(|\psi|^2)$ involving an
attractive $|\psi|^4$ term and a repulsive $|\psi|^6$ term. Using a Gaussian
ansatz for the wave function, we analytically obtain the mass-radius relation
of dilute and dense axion stars for arbitrary values of the self-interaction
parameter $\lambda\le 0$. We show the existence of a critical point
$|\lambda|_c\sim (m/M_P)^2$ above which a first order phase transition takes
place. We qualitatively estimate general relativistic corrections on the
mass-radius relation of axion stars. For weak self-interactions
$|\lambda|<|\lambda|_c$, a system of self-gravitating axions forms a stable
dilute axion star below a general relativistic maximum mass $M_{\rm
max,GR}^{\rm dilute}\sim M_P^2/m$ and collapses into a black hole above that
mass. For strong self-interactions $|\lambda|>|\lambda|_c$, a system of
self-gravitating axions forms a stable dilute axion star below a Newtonian
maximum mass $M_{\rm max,N}^{\rm dilute}=5.073 M_P/\sqrt{|\lambda|}$, collapses
into a dense axion star above that mass, and collapses into a black hole above
a general relativistic maximum mass $M_{\rm max,GR}^{\rm dense}\sim
\sqrt{|\lambda|}M_P^3/m^2$. Dense axion stars explode below a Newtonian minimum
mass $M_{\rm min,N}^{\rm dense}\sim m/\sqrt{|\lambda|}$ and form dilute axion
stars of large size or disperse away. We determine the phase diagram of
self-gravitating axions and show the existence of a triple point
$(|\lambda|_*,M_*/(M_P^2/m))$ separating dilute axion stars, dense axion stars,
and black holes. We make numerical applications for QCD axions and ultralight
axions.

the Internet in close proximity to devices and information sources. This, much
like a cache on a CPU, increases bandwidth and reduces latency for applications
but at a potential cost of dependability and capacity. This is because these
edge devices are often not as well maintained, dependable, powerful, or robust
as centralized server-class cloud resources. This article explores
dependability and deployment challenges in the field of edge computing, what
aspects are solvable with today's technology, and what aspects call for new
solutions.
  The first issue addressed is failures, both hard (crash, hang, etc.) and soft
(performance-related), and real-time constraint violation. In this domain, edge
computing bolsters real-time system capacity through reduced end-to-end
latency. However, much like cache misses, overloaded or malfunctioning edge
computers can drive latency beyond tolerable limits. Second, decentralized
management and device tampering can lead to chain of trust and security or
privacy violations. Authentication, access control, and distributed intrusion
detection techniques have to be extended from current cloud deployments and
need to be customized for the edge ecosystem. The third issue deals with
handling multi-tenancy in the typically resource-constrained edge devices and
the need for standardization to allow for interoperability across vendor
products.
  We explore the key challenges in each of these three broad issues as they
relate to dependability of edge computing and then hypothesize about promising
avenues of work in this area.

dimensions, including customer codes, total contribution, assets, deposit,
profit, profit rate, trading volume, trading amount, turnover rate, order
amount, withdraw amount, withdraw rate, process fee, process fee submitted,
process fee retained, net process fee retained, interest revenue, interest
return, exchange house return I and exchange house return II to group and rank
customers. The traditional way to group customers in securities or futures
companies is simply based on their assets. However, grouping customers with
respect to only one dimension cannot give us a full picture about customers'
attributions. It is hard to group customers' with similar attributions or
values into one group if we just consider assets as the only grouping
criterion. Nowadays, securities or futures companies usually group customers
based on managers' experience with lack of quantitative analysis, which is not
effective. Therefore, we use kmeans unsupervised learning methods to group
customers with respect to significant dimensions so as to cluster customers
with similar attributions together. Grouping is our first step. It is the
horizontal analysis in customer study. The next step is customer ranking. It is
the longitudinal analysis. It ranks customers by assigning each customer with a
certain score given by our weighted customer value calculation formula.
Therefore, by grouping and ranking customers, we can differentiate our
customers and rank them based on values instead of blindly reaching everyone.
