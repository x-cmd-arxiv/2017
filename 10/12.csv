nuclear rotational dynamics are reviewed and reassessed with a view to their
development in the light of recent progress and the research tools that are now
available. A motivation for this review is the widespread observation of
nuclear shape coexistence and sequences of rotational states in all regions of
the nuclear periodic table combined with the recognition that the study of the
rotational dynamics of quantum fluids has led to significant advances in the
quantum theory of many-boson systems. Recent experimental investigations of the
rotational dynamics of a low-temperature $^6$Li gas indicate that its slow
rotational flows are likewise the irrotational flows of a superfluid. In this
context, the dynamics of rotating nuclei are of fundamental interest because
the nucleus is a unique zero-temperature finite many-fermion quantum system. A
promising approach is provided by algebraic mean-field theory which, as its
name suggests, is a combination of algebraic and mean-field methods. Static
mean-field theories play a central role in many-body theory by defining optimal
independent-particle and independent quasi-particle basis states for the
quantum mechanics of many-fermion systems. Their time-dependent extensions also
lead, in the small-amplitude random-phase approximation, to the quantisation of
the classical normal-mode vibrations of many-fermion systems about their static
equilibrium states. This review shows that mean-field methods become
significantly more powerful when combined with algebraic methods and an
appropriate coupling scheme for the nuclear shell model.

events) studies of the competing nucleation of the alpha and gamma polymorphs
of glycine. In situ Raman spectroscopy is used to identify the polymorph of
each crystal. We find that the nucleation kinetics of the two polymorphs is
very different. Nucleation of the alpha polymorph starts off slowly but
accelerates, while nucleation of the gamma polymorph starts off fast but then
slows. We exploit this difference to increase the purity with which we obtain
the gamma polymorph by a factor of ten. The statistics of the nucleation of
crystals is analogous to that of human mortality, and using a result from
medical statistics we show that conventional nucleation data can say nothing
about what, if any, are the correlations between competing nucleation
processes. Thus we can show that, with data of our form, it is impossible to
disentangle the competing nucleation processes. We also find that the growth
rate and the shape of a crystal depends on when it nucleated. This is new
evidence that nucleation and growth are linked.

escaping star-forming galaxies to reionise the IGM $f_\mathrm{esc}$. Our
analysis uses SFR history data coming from luminosity functions, assuming that
star-forming galaxies were sufficient to lead the reionisation process at high
redshift. We add two other sets of constraints: measurements of the IGM ionised
fraction and the most recent result from Planck Satellite about the integrated
Thomson optical depth of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
$\tau_\mathrm{Planck}$. We also consider various possibilities for the
evolution of these two parameters with redshift, and confront them with
observational data cited above. We conclude that, if the model of a constant
clumping factor is chosen, the fiducial value of $3$ often used in papers is
consistent with observations; even if a redshift-dependent model is considered,
the resulting optical depth is strongly correlated to $C_{H_{II}}$ mean value
at $z>7$, an additional argument in favour of the use of a constant clumping
factor. Besides, the escape fraction is related to too many astrophysical
parameters to allow us to use a complete and fully satisfactory model. A
constant value with redshift seems again to be the most likely expression:
considering it as a fit parameter, we get from the maximum likelihood (ML)
model $f_\mathrm{esc}=0.24\pm0.08$; with a redshift-dependent model, we find an
almost constant evolution, slightly increasing with $z$, around
$f_\mathrm{esc}=0.23$. Last, our analysis shows that a reionisation beginning
as early as $z\geq14$ and persisting until $z\sim6$ is a likely storyline.

this phenomenon has already (unknowingly) been observed by UVSP/SMM, and the

interplay between partial redistribution in the H-K doublet of Ca II and

assumption of having a large set of input/output (I/O) examples for learning
any underlying input-output mapping. This paper aims to address the problem of
data and computation efficiency of program induction by leveraging information
from related tasks. Specifically, we propose two approaches for cross-task
knowledge transfer to improve program induction in limited-data scenarios. In
our first proposal, portfolio adaptation, a set of induction models is
pretrained on a set of related tasks, and the best model is adapted towards the
new task using transfer learning. In our second approach, meta program
induction, a $k$-shot learning approach is used to make a model generalize to
new tasks without additional training. To test the efficacy of our methods, we
constructed a new benchmark of programs written in the Karel programming
language. Using an extensive experimental evaluation on the Karel benchmark, we
demonstrate that our proposals dramatically outperform the baseline induction
method that does not use knowledge transfer. We also analyze the relative
performance of the two approaches and study conditions in which they perform
best. In particular, meta induction outperforms all existing approaches under
extreme data sparsity (when a very small number of examples are available),
i.e., fewer than ten. As the number of available I/O examples increase (i.e. a
thousand or more), portfolio adapted program induction becomes the best
approach. For intermediate data sizes, we demonstrate that the combined method
of adapted meta program induction has the strongest performance.

mesoscopic superconducting islands has a topologically ordered toric code
phase. Recently, a Landau field theory has been proposed for the system that
captures its different phases and the associated phase-transitions. It was
shown that with the increase of Josephson tunneling between the islands, a
continuous symmetry-breaking 3D-XY transition gets transformed into a discrete
symmetry-breaking 3D-Ising transition through a couple of tricritical points
and first order transitions. Using the proposed field theory, we analyze the
charge-response of the system at the different continuous phase-transitions. We
calculate the universal conductivity at the 3D-XY transitions and the change in
the superconducting density at the Ising transition using 1/N expansion.
Furthermore, by computing a one-loop correction to the field theory, we show
that an additional tricritical point is likely to be present in the
phase-diagram. Finally, we provide a mean-field calculation that supports the
earlier proposed field theory.

Several models incorporating indicators of tie strength have been proposed and

structural network metrics have been applied to predominantly online social
media sites to predict tie strength. Here, we introduce the concept of the
""social bow tie"" framework, a small subgraph of the network that consists of a
collection of nodes and ties that surround a tie of interest, forming a
topological structure that resembles a bow tie. We also define several
intuitive and interpretable metrics that quantify properties of the bow tie. We
use random forests and regression models to predict categorical and continuous
measures of tie strength from different properties of the bow tie, including
nodal attributes. We also investigate what aspects of the bow tie are most
predictive of tie strength in two distinct social networks: a collection of 75
rural villages in India and a nationwide call network of European mobile phone
users. Our results indicate several of the bow tie metrics are highly
predictive of tie strength, and we find the more the social circles of two
individuals overlap, the stronger their tie, consistent with previous findings.
However, we also find that the more tightly-knit their non-overlapping social
circles, the weaker the tie. This new finding complements our current
understanding of what drives the strength of ties in social networks.

networks is used to simulate gases released from shale during deformation and
failure. Changes in material properties required to reproduce experimentally
observed gas signals are explored. We model two different experiments of $^4$He
flow rate measured from shale undergoing mechanical deformation, a core
parallel to bedding and a core perpendicular to bedding. We find that the
helium signal is sensitive to fracture development and evolution as well as
changes in the matrix transport properties. We constrain the timing and
effective fracture aperture, as well as the increase in matrix porosity and
permeability. Increases in matrix permeability are required to explain gas flow
prior to macroscopic failure, and the short-term gas flow post failure.
Increased matrix porosity, is required to match the long-term, post-failure gas
flow. Our model provides the first quantitative interpretation of helium
release as a result of mechanical deformation. The sensitivity of this model to
changes in the fracture network, as well as to matrix properties during
deformation, indicates that helium release can be used as a quantitative tool
to evaluate the state of stress and strain in earth materials.

recent result by Early-Mazorchuk-Vishnyakova, we construct canonical simple

  As an example, we introduce the notion of a rational Galois order, attached
an arbitrary finite reflection group and a set of rational difference
operators, and show that they are principal Galois orders. Building on results
by Futorny-Molev-Ovsienko, we show that parabolic subalgebras of finite

$H=h\left(x=0,t\right)$, of the evolving Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) interface
$h\left(x,t\right)$ on a ring of length $2L$. The process starts from a flat
interface. At short times typical (small) height fluctuations are unaffected by
the KPZ nonlinearity and belong to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class.
The nonlinearity, however, strongly affects the (asymmetric) tails of
$\mathcal{P}(H)$. At large $L/\sqrt{t}$ the faster-decaying tail has a double
structure: it is $L$-independent,
$-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim\left|H\right|^{5/2}/t^{1/2}$, at intermediately large
$|H|$, and $L$-dependent, $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim \left|H\right|^{2}L/t$, at very
large $|H|$. The transition between these two regimes is sharp and, in the
large $L/\sqrt{t}$ limit, behaves as a fractional-order phase transition. The
transition point $H=H_{c}^{+}$ depends on $L/\sqrt{t}$. At small $L/\sqrt{t}$,
the double structure of the faster tail disappears, and only the very large-$H$
tail, $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim \left|H\right|^{2}L/t$, is observed. The
slower-decaying tail does not show any $L$-dependence at large $L/\sqrt{t}$,
where it coincides with the slower tail of the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution. At
small $L/\sqrt{t}$ this tail also has a double structure. The transition
between the two regimes occurs at a value of height $H=H_{c}^{-}$ which depends
on $L/\sqrt{t}$. At $L/\sqrt{t} \to 0$ the transition behaves as a
mean-field-like second-order phase transition. At $|H|<|H_c^{-}|$ the slower
tail behaves as $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim \left|H\right|^{2}L/t$, whereas at
$|H|>|H_c^{-}|$ it coincides with the slower tail of the GOE Tracy-Widom
distribution.

knowledge of nearby stars and brown dwarfs, understanding the properties and
structure of our Milky Way galaxy, and deep wide-field extragalactic surveys to
study galaxy birth and evolution. By extending Spitzer through 2020, it can
continue to make ground-breaking discoveries in those fields, and provide
crucial support to the NASA flagship missions JWST and WFIRST, as well as the
upcoming TESS mission, and it will complement ground-based observations by LSST

the previous perturbative calculations of this partition function. We begin by
reviewing the results obtained in the past ten years via a wealth of different
approaches, and then introduce the Ponzano--Regge model in a self-contained
way. Thanks to the topological nature of three-dimensional quantum gravity we
can solve exactly for the bulk degrees of freedom and identify dual boundary
theories which depend on the choice of boundary states, that can also describe
finite, non-asymptotic boundaries. This series of papers aims precisely at the
investigation of the role played by the different quantum boundary conditions
leading to different boundary theories. Here, we will describe the spin network
boundary states for the Ponzano-Regge model on the twisted torus and derive the
general expression for the corresponding partition functions. We identify a
class of boundary states describing a tessellation with maximally fuzzy squares
for which the partition function can be explicitly evaluated. In the limit case
of a large, but finely discretized, boundary we find a dependence on the Dehn
twist angle characteristic for the BMS3 character. We furthermore show how

standard QCD axion. This mechanism avoids the introduction of a discrete $Z_2$
symmetry and associated 'mirror' copies of the SM fermions, and also avoids the
introduction and stabilization of new light colored states to modify the
running of the QCD gauge coupling found in other heavy axion models. This
strengthens the motivation for axion-like particles solving the strong CP

predictive of Landau levels and quantum oscillations for conventional metals,
as well as for a host of topological metals which have emerged in the recent
intercourse between band theory, crystalline symmetries and topology. The
essential ingredients in any quantization rule are connection formulae that
match the semiclassical (WKB) wavefunction across regions of strong quantum
fluctuations. Here, we propose (a) a multi-component WKB wavefunction that
describes transport within degenerate-band subspaces, and (b) the requisite
connection formulae for saddlepoints and type-II Dirac points, where tunneling
respectively occurs within the same band, and between distinct bands. (a-b)
extend previous works by incorporating phase corrections that are subleading in
powers of the field; these corrections include the geometric Berry phase, and
account for the orbital magnetic moment and the Zeeman coupling. A
comprehensive symmetry analysis is performed for such phase corrections
occurring in closed orbits, which is applicable to solids in any (magnetic)
space group. We have further formulated a graph-theoretic description of
semiclassical orbits. This allows us to systematize the construction of
quantization rules for a large class of closed orbits (with or without
tunneling), as well as to formulate the notion of a topological invariant in
semiclassical magnetotransport -- as a quantity that is invariant under
continuous deformations of the graph. Landau levels in the presence of
tunneling are generically quasirandom, i.e., disordered on the scale of
nearest-neighbor level spacings but having longer-ranged correlations; we
develop a perturbative theory to determine Landau levels in such quasirandom

relating randomized subsampling to distributional invariance: Assuming an
invariance holds is tantamount to assuming the sample has been generated by a
specific algorithm. That in turn yields a notion of ergodicity. Sampling
algorithms induce model classes---graphon models, sparse generalizations of
exchangeable graphs, and random multigraphs with exchangeable edges can all be
obtained in this manner, and we specialize our results to a number of examples.
One class of sampling algorithms emerges as special: Roughly speaking, those
defined as limits of random transformations drawn uniformly from certain

which the entanglement entropy and spectrum can be calculated exactly: for
these, the constructed TNS is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
ground states with respect to particular entanglement cuts. Apart from the area
law, the entanglement entropies also have constant and linear corrections for
the fracton models, while the entanglement entropies for the toric code models
only have constant corrections. For the cuts we consider, the entanglement
spectra of these three models are completely flat. We also conjecture that the
negative linear correction to the area law is a signature of extensive ground

derived metallicity-dependent IMF and the moving-mesh code AREPO in order to
characterize the associated uncertainties. In particular, we compare a constant
Chabrier and a varying metallicity-dependent IMF in cosmological,
magneto-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-sized halos. We find
that the non-linear effects due to IMF variations typically have a limited

ratios, feedback strength, metallicity evolution and metallicity distributions
are in part degenerate with the effects of a non-universal,

metallicity and the high mass slope of the IMF does not aid in the quenching

feedback is kept constant. Additionally, the enrichment history and the z = 0

the bulk of the galaxy population, since they arise in both old and young
stellar populations. Our input sample consists of SNe with redshift < 0.05,

examine the dust-reprocessed star-formation rates (SFRs), molecular gas

We find that the gas fractions and central SFEs of both active and inactive
galaxies are similar when controlling for host stellar mass and morphology
(Hubble type). The equivalent central molecular gas depletion times are
consistent with the discs of normal spiral galaxies in the local Universe.
Despite energetic arguments that the AGN in LLAMA should be capable of
disrupting the observable cold molecular gas in their central environments, our
results indicate that nuclear radiation only couples weakly with this phase. We
find a mild preference for obscured AGN to contain higher amounts of central
molecular gas, which suggests a connection between AGN obscuration and the
gaseous environment of the nucleus. Systems with depressed SFEs are not found
among the LLAMA AGN. We speculate that the processes that sustain the collapse
of molecular gas into dense pre-stellar cores may also be a prerequisite for
the inflow of material on to AGN accretion disks.

the robustness of these estimates, including a comparison to BHARs and SFRs
derived from X-ray stacking and far-IR analysis, respectively. We find as the
progenit- ors evolve, their relative black hole-galaxy growth (i.e. their
BHAR/SFR ratio) increases from low to high redshift. The MW-mass progenitors
exhibit a log-log slope of 0.64 +/- 0.11, while the M31-mass progenitors are
0.39 +/- 0.08. This result contrasts with previous studies that find an almost
flat slope when adopting X-ray/AGN-selected or mass-limited samples and is
likely due to their use of a broad mixture of galaxies with different
evolutionary histories. Our use of progenitor-matched samples highlights the
potential importance of carefully selecting progenitors when searching for
evolutionary relationships between BHAR/SFRs. Additionally, our finding that
BHAR/SFR ratios do not track the rate at which progenitors quench casts doubts
over the idea that the suppression of star-formation is predominantly driven by
luminous AGN feedback (i.e. high BHARs).

The accretion disk has an extreme eccentricity 0.966 and semimajor axis of 340

lead to significant attenuation of He emission lines originally produced at

lobes with sharp surface brightness discontinuities between the shells and the
ambient gas. The temperature of the gas in the shells is less than that of the
ambient medium, suggesting that they are not AGN-driven shocks but rather gas
uplifted from the core by the buoyant rise of the radio bubbles. We estimate
the energy required to lift the gas to be up to $(1.1 \pm 0.3 )\times 10^{56}$
erg and $(3 \pm 1 )\times 10^{56}$ erg for the eastern and western rim
respectively, constituting a significant fraction of the total outburst energy.
A more conservative estimate suggests that the gas in the rim was uplifted a
smaller distance, requiring only $20-25\%$ of this energy. In either case, if a
significant fraction of this uplift energy is thermalized via hydrodynamic
instabilities or thermal conduction, our results suggest that it could be an
important source of heating in cool core clusters and groups. We also find
evidence for a central abundance drop in NGC 4472. The iron abundance profile
shows that the region along the cavity system has a lower metallicity than the
surrounding, undisturbed gas, similar to the central region. This also shows
that bubbles have lifted low-metallicity gas from the center.

non-perturbative model of three dimensional quantum gravity--the Ponzano-Regge
model, that we briefly review in a self-contained manner--which can be used to
compute quasi-local amplitudes for its boundary states. In this second paper of
the series, we choose a particular class of boundary spin-network states which
impose Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary conditions to the partition function. The
peculiarity of these states is to encode a two-dimensional quantum geometry
peaked around a classical quadrangulation of the finite toroidal boundary.
Thanks to the topological properties of three-dimensional gravity, the theory
easily projects onto the boundary while crucially still keeping track of the
topological properties of the bulk. This produces, at the non-perturbative
level, a specific non-linear sigma-model on the boundary, akin to a
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model, whose classical equations of motion can be
used to reconstruct different bulk geometries: the expected classical one is
accompanied by other ""quantum"" solutions. The classical regime of the
sigma-model becomes reliable in the limit of large boundary spins, which
coincides with the semiclassical limit of the boundary geometry. In a 1-loop
approximation around the solutions to the classical equations of motion, we
recover (with corrections due to the non-classical bulk geometries) results
obtained in the past via perturbative quantum General Relativity and through
the study of characters of the BMS3 group. The exposition is meant to be
completely self-contained.

exhibit high damage thresholds and strong enhancement of the driving field,
making them attractive platforms to control high-harmonics and other high-field

emission from a Si metasurface that possesses a sharp Fano resonance resulting
from a classical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency. Harmonic
emission is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to
unpatterned samples. The enhanced high harmonics are highly anisotropic with
excitation polarization and are selective to excitation wavelength due to its
resonant feature. By combining nanofabrication technology and ultrafast
strong-field physics, our work paves the way for designing new compact
ultrafast photonic devices that operate under high intensities and short

hydrodynamical wave energy emerging from the core of the progenitor star during
late nuclear burning phases. Here, we examine the effects of wave heating in
stars containing little or no hydrogen, i.e., progenitors of type IIb/Ib SNe.
Because there is no massive hydrogen envelope, wave energy is thermalized near
the stellar surface where the overlying atmospheric mass is small but the
optical depth is large. Wave energy can thus unbind this material, driving an
optically thick, super-Eddington wind. Using 1D hydodynamic MESA simulations of
$\sim \! 5 \, M_\odot$ He stars, we find that wave heating can drive pre-SN
outbursts composed of a dense wind whose mass loss rate can exceed $\sim \! 0.1
\, M_\odot/{\rm yr}$. The wind terminal velocities are a few $100 \, {\rm
km}/{\rm s}$, and outburst luminosities can reach $\sim \! 10^6 \, L_\odot$.
Wave-driven outbursts may be linked with observed or inferred pre-SN outbursts
of type Ibn/transitional/transformational SNe, and pre-SN wave-driven mass loss
is a good candidate to produce these types of SNe. However, we also show that
non-linear wave breaking in the core of the star may prevent such outbursts in
stars with thick convective helium-burning shells. Hence, only a limited subset
of SN progenitors are likely to experience wave-driven pre-SN outbursts.

mass white dwarf (WD) models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the
turbulent deflagration model with deflagration-detonation transition (DDT). We
perform a parameter survey for 41 models to study the effects of the initial
central density (i.e., WD mass), metallicity, flame shape, DDT criteria, and
turbulent flame formula for a much wider parameter space than earlier studies.
The final isotopic abundances of $^{11}$C to $^{91}$Tc in these simulations are
obtained by post-process nucleosynthesis calculations. The survey includes SNe
Ia models with the central density from $5 \times 10^8$ g cm$^{-3}$ to $5
\times 10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$ (WD masses of 1.30 - 1.38 $M_\odot$), metallicity from
0 to 5 $Z_{\odot}$, C/O mass ratio from 0.3 - 1.0 and ignition kernels
including centered and off-centered ignition kernels. We present the yield
tables of stable isotopes from $^{12}$C to $^{70}$Zn as well as the major
radioactive isotopes for 33 models. Observational abundances of $^{55}$Mn,
$^{56}$Fe, $^{57}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni obtained from the solar composition,
well-observed SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants are used to constrain the explosion
models and the supernova progenitor. The connection between the pure turbulent
deflagration model and the subluminous SNe Iax is discussed. We find that
dependencies of the nucleosynthesis yields on the metallicity and the central
density (WD mass) are large. To fit these observational abundances and also for
the application of galactic chemical evolution modeling, these dependencies on
the metallicity and WD mass should be taken into account.

precisely, to reason about, and to verify. More than a decade of effort has
gone into nailing down the definitions of the ARM and IBM Power memory models,
and yet there still remain aspects of those models which (perhaps surprisingly)
remain unresolved to this day. In response to these complexities, there has
been somewhat of a recent trend in the (general-purpose) architecture community
to limit new memory models to being (multicopy) atomic: where store values can
be read by the issuing processor before being advertised to other processors.
TSO is the most notable example, used in the past by IBM 370 and SPARC-TSO, and
currently used in x86. Recently (in March 2017) ARM has also switched to a
multicopy atomic memory model, and the new RISC-V ISA and recent academic
proposals such as WMM are pushing to do the same.
  In this paper, we show that when memory models are atomic, it becomes much
easier to produce axiomatic definitions, operational definitions, and proofs of
equivalence than doing the same under non-atomic models. The increased ease
with which these definitions can be produced in turn allows architects to build
processors much more confidently, and yet the relaxed nature of the models we
propose still allows most or all of the performance of non-atomic models to be
retained. In fact, in this paper, we show that atomic memory models can be
defined in a way that is parametrized by basic instruction and fence orderings.
Our operational vs. axiomatic equivalence proofs, which are likewise
parameterized, show that the operational model is sound with respect to the
axioms and that the operational model is complete: that it can show any
behavior permitted by axiomatic model.

Universe, such as the baryogenesis, the unification of the strong and
electroweak forces and the nucleosynthesis. However, understanding the very
early Universe, close to the Planck epoch, still presents a major challenge.
The theory of inflation, which is assumed to have taken place towards the end
of the very early Universe, has been introduced in order to solve a number of
cosmological problems. However, concrete observational evidence for inflation
is still outstanding and the physical mechanisms behind inflation remain mostly
unknown. In this paper we argue for inflation from a different standpoint. In
order for time to have any concrete physical meaning in the very early and the
early Universe, the capacity of the Universe to measure time - its size or,
equivalently, memory - must be at least as large as the number of clock ""ticks""
that need to be recorded somewhere within the Universe. Using this simple
criterion, we provide a sketch proof showing that in the absence of inflation
the subsystems of the Universe might not have been able to undertake the
synchronised evolution described by the time we use today.

natural setting for the fluid-gravity duality than the Kraichnan-Kolmogorov
scaling of $E(k) \sim k^{-5/3}$, but we obtain fractal dimensions $D$ for
spatial sections of the horizon $H\cap\Sigma$ in both cases: $D=2.584(1)$ and
$D=2.645(4)$, respectively. These results are consistent with the upper bound

Chesler, Liu (2014) that $D=3+1/3$. We offer a critical examination of the

of fractal dimension performs poorly as a fractal dimension estimator on
$1$-dimensional curves with known fractal dimension. Finally, we describe how

We illustrate that the depth dependence of this orientational anisotropy is
determined by the geometric constraints of hydrogen bonding and we show that
the primary features of simulated orientational distributions can be reproduced
by assuming an idealized, perfectly tetrahedral hydrogen bonding geometry. We
also demonstrate that non-ideal hydrogen bond geometries are required to
produce interfacial variations in the average orientational polarization and
polarizability. We find that these interfacial properties contain significant
contributions from a specific type of geometrically distorted three-body

findings thus reveal that the dielectric properties of the liquid water-vapor

features of the MRJ packings, especially its disordered hyperuniformity,
exceptional physical properties can be expected. Here, we employ these
structural descriptors to estimate effective transport and electromagnetic
properties via rigorous bounds, exact expansions, and accurate analytical
approximation formulas. These property formulas include interfacial bounds as
well as universal scaling laws for the mean survival time and the fluid
permeability. We also estimate the principal relaxation time associated with
Brownian motion among perfectly absorbing traps. For the propagation of
electromagnetic waves in the long-wavelength limit, we show that a dispersion
of dielectric MRJ spheres within a matrix of another dielectric material forms,
to a very good approximation, a dissipationless disordered and isotropic
two-phase medium for any phase dielectric contrast ratio. We compare the
effective properties of the MRJ sphere packings to those of overlapping
spheres, equilibrium hard-sphere packings, and lattices of hard spheres.
Moreover, we generalize results to micro- and macroscopically anisotropic
packings of spheroids with tensorial effective properties. The analytic bounds
predict the qualitative trend in the physical properties associated with these

validation of the predictive performance of mechanics-based mathematical models

proposed approximate analytical solution developed for the lossy spring--mass

to carefully identify the system parameters in the proposed model. We also
present our assessments on the predictive performance of the proposed
approximate analytical solution on our one-legged hopping robot data.
  The second part considers estimating state space models of legged locomotion
using input--output data. To accomplish this, we first propose a state space
identification method to estimate time periodic state and input matrices of a
hybrid LTP system under full state measurement assumption. We then release this
assumption and proceed with subspace identification methods to estimate LTP
state space realizations for unknown stable LTP systems. We utilize bilinear
(Tustin) transformation and frequency domain lifting methods to generalize our
solutions to different LTP system models. Our results provide a basis towards
identification of state space models for legged locomotion.

f$_{\text{esc,GMC}}$, from a suite of individual GMC simulations with masses in
the range 10$^{4-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ using the adaptive-mesh refinement code FLASH.
We find significantly different f$_{\text{esc,GMC}}$ depending on the GMC mass

M$_{\odot}$ clouds or remain low at $\sim$5% for most of the lifetime of more
massive GMCs. All clouds show fluctuations over short, sub-Myr timescales
produced by flickering HII regions. We combine our results to calculate the
total escape fraction (f$_{\text{esc,tot}}$) from GMC populations in dwarf
starburst and spiral galaxies by randomly drawing clouds from a GMC mass
distribution (dN/dM$\propto$M$^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is either -1.5 or
-2.5) over fixed time intervals. We find typical f$_{\text{esc,tot}}$ values of

promising alternative for the next generation wireless standard, i.e., 5G.
However, the susceptibility of mmWave signals to severe pathloss and shadowing
requires the use of highly directional antennas to overcome such adverse
characteristics. Building a network with directional beams changes the
interference behavior, since, narrow beams are vulnerable to blockages. Such
sensitivity to blockages causes uncertainty in the active interfering node
locations. Configuration uncertainty may also manifest in the spectral domain
while applying dynamic channel and frequency assignment to support 5G
applications. In this paper, we first propose a blockage model considering
mmWave specifications. Subsequently, using the proposed blockage model, we
derive a spatial-spectral interference model for dense finite-area 5G mmWave
networks. The proposed interference model considers both spatial and spectral
randomness in node configuration. Finally, the error performance of the network
from an arbitrarily located user perspective is calculated in terms of bit
error rate (BER) and outage probability metrics. The analytical results are
validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. It is shown that considering mmWave
specifications and also randomness in both spectral and spatial node
configurations leads to a noticeably different interference profile.

  Distributed Robots",,,,"cs.MA cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-agent navigation, agents need to move towards their goal locations
while avoiding collisions with other agents and static obstacles, often without
communication with each other. Existing methods compute motions that are
optimal locally but do not account for the aggregated motions of all agents,
producing inefficient global behavior especially when agents move in a crowded
space. In this work, we develop methods to allow agents to dynamically adapt
their behavior to their local conditions. We accomplish this by formulating the
multi-agent navigation problem as an action-selection problem, and propose an
approach, ALAN, that allows agents to compute time-efficient and collision-free
motions. ALAN is highly scalable because each agent makes its own decisions on
how to move using a set of velocities optimized for a variety of navigation
tasks. Experimental results show that the agents using ALAN, in general, reach
their destinations faster than using ORCA, a state-of-the-art collision
avoidance framework, the Social Forces model for pedestrian navigation, and a
Predictive collision avoidance model.

them. Here we introduce disorders by electron irradiation and measure in-plane
resistivity, Hall resistivity, X-ray scattering, and London penetration depth.
With increasing disorder, $T_{\textrm{c}}$ varies nonmonotonically, whereas
$T_{\textrm{CDW}}$ monotonically decreases and becomes unresolvable above a
critical irradiation dose where $T_{\textrm{c}}$ drops sharply. Our results
imply that CDW order initially competes with superconductivity, but eventually
assists it. We argue that at the transition where the long-range CDW order
disappears, the cooperation with superconductivity is dramatically suppressed.
X-ray scattering and Hall resistivity measurements reveal that the short-range
CDW survives above the transition. Superconductivity persists to much higher
dose levels, consistent with fully gapped superconductivity and moderate
interband pairing.

Josephson junctions, so-called SNS junctions. One can show that the axion field
equations in a Josephson environment allow for very small oscillating
supercurrents, which manifest themselves as a tiny wiggle in the I-V curve, a
so-called Shapiro step, which occurs at a frequency given by the axion mass.
The effect is very small but perfectly measurable in modern nanotechnological
devices. In this paper I will summarize the theory and then present evidence
that candidate Shapiro steps of this type have indeed been seen in several
independent condensed matter experiments. Assuming the observed tiny Shapiro
steps are due to axion flow then these data point to an axion mass of $(106 \pm
6)\mu$eV, consistent with what is expected for the QCD axion. In addition to
the above small Shapiro resonance effects at frequencies in the GHz region one
also expects to see broad-band noise effects at much lower frequencies. Overall
this approach provides a novel pathway for the future design of new types of
axionic dark matter detectors. The resonant Josephson data summarized in this
paper are consistent with a 'vanilla' axion with a coupling constant
$f_a=\sqrt{v_{EW}m_{Pl}}=5.48 \cdot 10^{10}$GeV given by the geometric average
of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale $v_{EW}$ and the Planck mass

LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Surveys (LEGAS) in the SGC, the deficiencies of source
selection methods and the basic performance parameters of LAMOST telescope. In
both fields, more than 95% of galaxies have been observed. A post-processing
has been applied to LAMOST 1D spectrum to remove the majority of remaining sky
background residuals. More than 10,000 spectra have been visually inspected to
measure the redshift by using combinations of different emission/absorption
features with uncertainty of $\sigma_{z}/(1+z)<0.001$. In total, there are 1528
redshifts (623 absorption and 905 emission line galaxies) in Field A and 1570
redshifts (569 absorption and 1001 emission line galaxies) in Field B have been
measured. The results show that it is possible to derive redshift from low SNR
galaxies with our post-processing and visual inspection. Our analysis also
indicates that up to 1/4 of the input targets for a typical extra-galactic
spectroscopic survey might be unreliable. The multi-wavelength data analysis
shows that the majority of mid-infrared-detected absorption (91.3%) and
emission line galaxies (93.3%) can be well separated by an empirical criterion
of $W2-W3=2.4$. Meanwhile, a fainter sequence paralleled to the main population
of galaxies has been witnessed both in $M_r$/$W2-W3$ and $M_*$/$W2-W3$

contaminated by the edge-on/highly inclined galaxies ($\sim30\%$).

previous studies, we find out that galactic magnetic field is mostly aligned
with gaseous structures, however small-scale gaseous structures (spurs and
clumps) are more chaotic than the magnetic field structure. In spiral arms
magnetic field strongly coexists with the gas distribution, in the inter-arm
region we see filamentary magnetic field structure. Simulations reveal the
presence of the small-scale irregularities of the magnetic field as well as the
reversal of magnetic field at the outer edge of the large-scale spurs. We
provide evidences that the magnetic field in the spiral arms has a stronger
mean-field component, and there is a clear inverse correlation between gas
density and plasma-beta parameter, compared to the rest of the disk with a more
turbulent component of the field and an absence of correlation between gas
density and plasma-beta. We show the mean field growth up to 3-10$\mu G$ in the
cold gas during several rotation periods (500-800 Myr), whereas ratio between
azimuthal and radial field is equal to 4/1. Mean field strength increases by a
factor of 1.5-2.5 for models with various spiral pattern parameters. Random
magnetic field component can reach up to 25 % from the total strength. By
making an analysis of the time-depended evolution of radial Poynting flux we
point out that the magnetic field strength is enhanced stronger at the galactic

requires self-consistent consideration of fluid mechanical and thermal effects.
We approach the problem via Volume-of-Fluid based simulations that include
destabilizing liquid metal-solid substrate interaction potentials. These
simulations couple fluid dynamics directly with the spatio-temporal evolution
of the temperature field both in the fluid and in the substrate. We focus on
the influence of the temperature variation of material parameters, in
particular of surface tension and viscosity. Regarding variation of surface
tension with temperature, the main finding is that while Marangoni effect may
not play a significant role in the considered setting, the temporal variation
of surface tension (modifying normal stress balance) is significant and could
lead to complex evolution including oscillatory evolution of the liquid
metal-air interface. Temperature variation of film viscosity is also found to
be relevant. Therefore, the variations of surface tensions and viscosity could
both influence the emerging wavelengths in experiments. In contrast, the
filament geometry is found to be much less sensitive to a variation of material

absorbed by the extragalactic background light (EBL), it is crucial to know the
redshift of the source in order to reconstruct its original spectral energy
distribution, as well as to constrain EBL models. However, the optical spectrum
of this BL\,Lac is almost featureless, so a direct measurement of $z$ is very
difficult; in fact, the published redshift value for this source ($z=0.444$)
has been strongly questioned. Based on EBL absorption arguments, several
constraints to its redshift, in the range $0.096 < z < 0.5$, were proposed.
  Since these AGNs are hosted, typically, in early type galaxies that are
members of groups or clusters, we have analysed spectro-photometrically the
environment of 3C66A, with the goal of finding the galaxy group hosting this
blazar. This study was made using optical images of a $5.5 \times
5.5$\,arcmin$^{2}$ field centred on the blazar, and spectra of 24 sources
obtained with Gemini/GMOS-N multi-object spectroscopy.
  We found spectroscopic evidence of two galaxy groups along the blazar's line
of sight: one at $z \simeq 0.020$ and a second one at $z \simeq 0.340$. The
first one is consistent with a known foreground structure, while the second
group here presented has six spectroscopically confirmed members. Their
location along a red sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram allows us to
identify 34 additional candidate members of the more distant group. The
blazar's spectrum shows broad absorption features that we identify as arising
in the intergalactic medium, thus allowing us to tentatively set a redshift
lower limit at $z_{3C66A} \ge 0.33$. As a consequence, we propose that 3C66A is
hosted in a galaxy that belongs to a cluster at $z=0.340$.

the improved counting statistics or frequency-comb precision afforded by

describes a novel approach for a pulse shape based event classification
developed in the context of the Double Chooz reactor antineutrino experiment.
Unlike previous implementations, this method uses the Fourier power spectra of
the scintillation pulse shapes to obtain event-wise information. A
classification variable built from spectral information was able to achieve an
unprecedented performance, despite the lack of optimization at the detector
design level. Several examples of event classification are provided, ranging
from differentiation between the detector volumes and an efficient rejection of
instrumental light noise, to some sensitivity to the particle type, such as
stopping muons, ortho-positronium formation, alpha particles as well as
electrons and positrons. In combination with other techniques the method is
expected to allow for a versatile and more efficient background rejection in
the future, especially if detector optimization is taken into account at the
design level.

we show how to approximate the kernel density estimate described by a large

For characteristic kernels (including Gaussian and Laplace kernels), our
approximation preserves the $L_\infty$ error between kernel density estimates
within error $\epsilon$, with coreset size $2/\epsilon^2$, but no other aspects
of the data, including the dimension, the diameter of the point set, or the
bandwidth of the kernel common to other approximations. When the dimension is

broader set.
  This work provides a careful analysis of the iterative Frank-Wolfe algorithm
adapted to this context, an algorithm called \emph{kernel herding}. This
analysis unites a broad line of work that spans statistics, machine learning,

  When the dimension $d$ is constant, we demonstrate much tighter bounds on the
size of the coreset specifically for Gaussian kernels, showing that it is
bounded by the size of the coreset for axis-aligned rectangles. Currently the
best known constructive bound is $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log^d

$\sqrt{\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}}$. This improves the best constant dimension

Specifically, our method is based on kernel ridge regression model. The
conventional kernel ridge regression can be computationally prohibited because
of the large volume of seismic measurements. We employ a data reduction
technique in combination with the conventional kernel ridge regression method
to improve the computational efficiency and reduce memory usage. In particular,
we utilize a randomized numerical linear algebra technique, named Nystr\""om

compromising the information content required for accurate detection. We
provide thorough computational cost analysis to show efficiency of our new

our new subsurface geologic feature detection method using synthetic surface
seismic data for 2D acoustic and elastic velocity models. Our numerical
examples demonstrate that our new detection method significantly improves the
computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy. Interestingly,

decomposing undirected graphs. In this paper we show that transitive acyclic

simplifies reduction for transitive digraphs, requiring only the computation of
strongly connected components. Furthermore, we are interested in permutation
graphs, where both the graph and its complement are transitively orientable.
Such graphs may be represented indirectly, as the transitive closure of a given

allows us to identify prime-free modules w.r.t their transitive closure, which
speeds up both modular decomposition and transitive orientation for sparse

be seen as formal canonical relations between the cotangent bundles. They are
specified by generating functions depending as arguments on coordinates on the
source manifold and momentum variables on the target manifold, and which are
formal power expansions in momenta. Microformal morphisms act on functions by
pullbacks that are non-linear transformations. (The initial motivation that led
us to introducing such a notion was constructing $L_{\infty}$-morphisms of
higher Koszul brackets.) Constructions obtained in this paper give, in
particular, non-linear pullbacks of differential forms.

relaxes the constraints on the relay beamforming matrix such that only partial
user-interference, instead of all, is canceled at the relay. The users
eliminate the remaining interferences through self-interference and successive
interference cancellation. A sum-rate maximization problem is formulated and
solved to exploit the extra degrees-of-freedom resulted from PZF. Simulation

significantly higher network sum-rates than the existing linear beamforming

numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. The most
effective such treatments utilize a discrete spatial representation---a grid.
Since most strong-field observables relate to the continuum portion of the wave
function, the boundaries of the grid---which act as hard walls and thus cause
reflection---can substantially impact the observables. Special care thus needs
to be taken. While there exist a number of attempts to solve this
problem---e.g., complex absorbing potentials and masking functions, exterior
complex scaling, and coordinate scaling---none of them are completely
satisfactory. The first of these is arguably the most popular, but it consumes
a substantial fraction of the computing resources in any given calculation.
Worse, this fraction grows with the dimensionality of the problem. And, no
systematic way to design such a potential has been used in the strong-field
community. In this work, we address these issues and find a much better
solution. By comparing with previous widely used absorbing potentials, we find
a factor of 3--4 reduction in the absorption range, given the same level of
absorption over a specified energy interval.

field as high as $\sim 10^{15}$~G could be created by dynamo action of the
newborn liquid QS, and a magnetar-like central engine (after solidification)
supplies significant energy for the second plateau. More energy could be
released during a fall-back accretion after the post-merger QS collapses to a
BH, and the X-ray bump forms. This post-merger QS model might be tested by

power spectral density (PSD) models to fit the anti-correlation between
normalized excess variance ($\sigma^2_{\rm nxv}$) and luminosity, and obtain a
best-fit power law index $\beta=1.16^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ for the low-frequency
part of AGN PSD. We also divide the whole light curves into 4 epochs in order
to inspect the dependence of $\sigma^2_{\rm nxv}$ on these timescales, finding
an overall increasing trend. The analysis of these shorter light curves also
infers a $\beta$ of $\sim 1.3$ that is consistent with the above-derived
$\beta$, which is larger than the frequently-assumed value of $\beta=1$. We
then investigate the evolution of $\sigma^2_{\rm nxv}$. No definitive
conclusion is reached due to limited source statistics but, if present, the
observed trend goes in the direction of decreasing AGN variability at fixed
luminosity toward large redshifts. We also search for transient events and find
6 notable candidate events with our considered criteria. Two of them may be a
new type of fast transient events, one of which is reported here for the first

quantitative deformation measurement due to its non-contact, low-cost, highly

quite important to efficiently obtain a reliable initial guess. The most widely
used method for obtaining initial guess is reliability-guided digital image
correlation (RG-DIC) method, which is reliable but path-dependent. This
path-dependent method limits the further improvement of computation speed of
DIC using parallel computing technology, and error of calculation may be spread
out along the calculation path. Therefore, a reliable and path-independent
algorithm which is able to provide reliable initial guess is desirable to reach
full potential of the ability of parallel computing. In this paper, an
algorithm used for initial guess estimation is proposed. Numerical and real
experiments show that the proposed algorithm, adaptive incremental
dissimilarity approximations algorithm (A-IDA), has the following
characteristics: 1) Compared with inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN)
sub-pixel registration algorithm, the computational time required by A-IDA
algorithm is negligible, especially when subset size is relatively large; 2)
the efficiency of A-IDA algorithm is less influenced by search range; 3) the

density of states are in good agreement with experiment: The trend of the
mobility gap with arsenic content is reproduced. The sample-to-sample variation
in the energies of states near the mobility gap is quantitatively consistent
with the width of the Urbach tail in the optical edge observed in experiment.
Most importantly, our samples consistently exhibit very deep-lying midgap
electronic states that are delocalized significantly more than what would be
expected for a deep impurity or defect state; the delocalization is highly
anisotropic. These properties are consistent with those of the topological
midgap electronic states that have been proposed by Zhugayevych and Lubchenko
as an explanation for several puzzling opto-electronic anomalies observed in
the chalcogenides, including light-induced midgap absorption and ESR signal,
and anomalous photoluminescence. In a complement to the traditional view of the
Urbach states as a generic consequence of disorder in atomic positions, the
present results suggest these states can be also thought of as intimate pairs
of topological midgap states that cannot recombine because of disorder.
Finally, samples with an odd number of electrons exhibit neutral, spin $1/2$
midgap states as well as polaron-like configurations that consist of a charge
carrier bound to an intimate pair of midgap states; the polaron's

$\approx$ 1.5 $-$ 2.0 $\rm M_{\odot}$) post-AGB star in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. Through a systematic abundance study, using high-resolution optical
spectra from UVES, we found that this likely post-AGB object shows an
intriguing photospheric composition with no confirmed carbon-enhancement (upper
limit of [C/Fe] $<$ 0.50) nor enrichment of $s$-process elements. We derived an
oxygen abundance of [O/Fe] = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.1. For Fe and O, we took into account
the effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE). We could not derive
an upper limit for the nitrogen abundance as there are no useful nitrogen lines
within our spectral coverage. The chemical pattern displayed by this object has
not been observed in single or binary post-AGBs. Based on its derived stellar
parameters and inferred evolutionary state, single star nucleosynthesis models
predict that this star should have undergone TDU episodes while on the AGB and
be carbon-enriched. However, our observations are in contrast with these
predictions. We identify two possible Galactic analogues which are likely to be
post-AGB stars, but the lack of accurate distances (hence luminosities) to
these objects does not allow us to confirm their post-AGB status. If they have
low luminosities then they are likely to be dusty post-RGB stars. The discovery
of J005252.87-722842.9 reveals a new stellar evolutionary channel whereby a
star evolves without any third dredge-up episodes.

wealth thresholds become less stringent, allowing agents to move into
neighborhoods they cannot afford. The number of such moves required for the
onset of this transformation varies inversely with the likelihood of agents
willing to move into less wealthy neighborhoods. We also find that this sharp
transformation from segregated to mixed wealth states is simultaneously
accompanied by a corresponding non-linear transformation from a less
identity-segregated to a highly identity-segregated state. We argue that the
decrease in wealth segregation does not merely accompany, but in fact drives
the increase in identity-based segregation. This implies that lowering wealth
segregation necessarily exacerbates identity segregation and that therefore,
this trade-off could to be an important consideration in designing urban
policy. Additionally, we find that the time taken for the tolerance levels of
residents to be breached is significantly lesser under rapid migration. This
rapidity of breach of tolerance could potentially underpin the intensity of
resident responses to sharp bursts of migration.

surface deformation measurements. DIC relies on nonlinear optimization method.
Thus an initial guess is quite important due to its influence on the converge
characteristics of the algorithm. In order to obtain a reliable, accurate
initial guess, a reliability-guided digital image correlation (RG-DIC) method,
which is able to intelligently obtain a reliable initial guess without using
time-consuming integer-pixel registration, was proposed. However, the RG-DIC
and its improved methods are path-dependent and cannot be fully parallelized.
Besides, it is highly possible that RG-DIC fails in the full-field analysis of
deformation without manual intervention if the deformation fields contain large
areas of discontinuous deformation. Feature-based initial guess is highly
robust while it is relatively time-consuming. Recently, path-independent
algorithm, fast Fourier transform-based cross correlation (FFT-CC) algorithm,
was proposed to estimate the initial guess. Complete parallelizability is the
major advantage of the FFT-CC algorithm, while it is sensitive to small
deformation. Wu et al proposed an efficient integer-pixel search scheme, but
the parameters of this algorithm are set by the users empirically. In this
technical note, a fully parallelizable DIC method is proposed. Different from
RG-DIC method, the proposed method divides DIC algorithm into two parts:
full-field initial guess estimation and sub-pixel registration. The proposed
method has the following benefits: 1) providing a pre-knowledge of deformation
fields; 2) saving computational time; 3) reducing error propagation; 4)
integratability with well-established DIC algorithms; 5) fully

including Weighted Matching, Negative Cycle Detection, Minimum Weight Cycle,
Replacement Paths, and 2-hop Cover, in $O(\mathrm{td}\cdot m)$ time or
$O(\mathrm{td}\cdot (m+n\log n))$ time, where $\mathrm{td}$ is the tree-depth

tree-depth at most $(\mathrm{tw}+1)\log_2 n$, our algorithms also run in

are evaluated in independent studies that did not contribute to model
development. While prospective cohort studies provide a natural setting for
model validation, they often ascertain information on some risk factors (e.g.,
an expensive biomarker) in a nested sub-study of the original cohort, typically
selected based on case-control status, and possibly some additional covariates.
In this article, we propose an efficient approach for evaluating discriminatory
ability of models using data from all individuals in a cohort study
irrespective of whether they were sampled in the nested sub-study for measuring
the complete set of risk factors. For evaluation of the Area Under the Curve
(AUC) statistics, we estimate probabilities of risk-scores for cases being
larger than those in controls conditional on partial risk-scores, the component
of the risk-score that could be defined based on partial covariate information.
The use of partial risk-scores, as opposed to actual multivariate risk-factor
profiles, allows estimation of the underlying conditional expectations using
subjects with complete covariate information in a non-parametric fashion even
when numerous covariates are involved. We propose an influence function based
approach for estimation of the variance of the resulting AUC statistics. We
evaluate finite sample performance of the proposed method and compare it to an
inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator through extensive simulation
studies. Finally, we illustrate an application of the proposed method for
evaluating performance of a lung cancer risk prediction model using data from
the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) trial.

Everitt et al. (2017) investigated the use of exact-approximate importance

describes SMC samplers that may use alternative sequences of distributions, and
describes ways in which likelihood estimates may be improved adaptively as the

optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In

exploit the mobility of the UAV in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a

representation function prior to its use in training or testing. Techniques for
learning such representation functions from data have been successful
empirically, but typically lack theoretical fairness guarantees. We show that
it is possible to prove that a representation function is fair according to
common measures of both group and individual fairness, as well as useful with
respect to a target task. These provable properties can be used in a governance

simulation. The net, which is composed of 9 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons arranged in a square lattice, is fully connected with interneuronal
communication delay proportional to the corresponding distance. The network is
initially stimulated with different stimuli and then goes freely. For each
stimulus, in the course of free evolution, activity either dies out completely
or the network converges to a periodic trajectory, which may be different for
different stimuli. The latter is observed for a set of 285290 initial stimuli
which constitutes 83% of all stimuli applied. By applying each stimulus from
the set, we found 102 different periodic end-states. By analyzing the
trajectories, we conclude that neuronal firing is the necessary prerequisite
for merging different trajectories into a single one, which eventually
transforms into a periodic regime. Observed phenomena of self-organization in
the time domain are discussed as a possible model for processes taking place
during perception. The repetitive firing in the periodic regimes could underpin
memory formation.

we simulate the long-term evolution of ONe WDs by accreting CO material. The
ONe WDs undergo weak multicycle carbon flashes during the mass-accretion
process, leading to the mass increase of the WDs. We found that different
initial WD masses and mass-accretion rates have influence on the evolution of
central density and temperature. However, the central temperature cannot reach
the explosive oxygen ignition temperature due to the neutrino cooling. This
work implies that the final outcome of accreting ONe WDs is electron-capture

varying dust properties as in Facchini et al. (2017). We obtain the gas and
dust temperature structures, chemical abundances, and synthetic emission maps
of both thermal continuum and CO rotational lines. This is the first study
combining hydro simulations, dust evolution and chemistry to predict gas
emission of disks hosting massive planets. All radial intensity profiles of the
CO main isotopologues show a gap at the planet location. The ratio between the
location of the gap as seen in CO and the peak in the mm continuum at the
pressure maximum outside the orbit of the planet shows a clear dependence on
planet mass. Due to the low dust density in the gaps, the dust and gas
components can become thermally decoupled, with the gas being colder than the
dust. The gaps seen in CO are due to a combination of gas temperature dropping
at the location of the planet, and of the underlying surface density profile.
In none of the models is a CO cavity observed, only CO gaps, indicating that
one single massive planet is not able to explain the CO cavities observed in
transition disks.

selecting relays in Colocation Facilities (Colos). In this work, we answer the
following questions: (i) how Colo-hosted relays compare with other relays as
well as with the direct Internet, in terms of latency (RTT) reductions; (ii)
what are the best locations for placing the relays to yield these reductions.
To this end, we conduct a large-scale one-month measurement of inter-domain
paths between RIPE Atlas (RA) nodes as endpoints, located at eyeball networks.
We employ as relays Planetlab nodes, other RA nodes, and machines in Colos. We
examine the RTTs of the overlay paths obtained via the selected relays, as well
as the direct paths. We find that Colo-based relays perform the best and can
achieve latency reductions against direct paths, ranging from a few to 100s of

$V(x,t)=V(x-x_0(\epsilon t))$, periodically shaken in time at a slow frequency
$\epsilon$, provides an important quantum mechanical system where the adiabatic
theorem fails to predict the asymptotic dynamics over time scales longer than $
\sim 1 / \epsilon$. Specifically, we consider a double-well potential $V(x)$
sustaining two bound states spaced in frequency by $\omega_0$ and
periodically-shaken in complex plane. Two different spatial displacements
$x_0(t)$ are assumed: the real spatial displacement $x_0(\epsilon t)=A \sin
(\epsilon t)$, corresponding to ordinary Hermitian shaking, and the complex one
$x_0(\epsilon t)=A-A \exp( -i \epsilon t)$, corresponding to non-Hermitian
shaking. When the particle is initially prepared in the ground state of the
potential well, breakdown of adiabatic evolution is found for both Hermitian
and non-Hermitian shaking whenever the oscillation frequency $\epsilon$ is
close to an odd-resonance of $\omega_0$. However, a different physical
mechanism underlying nonadiabatic transitions is found in the two cases. For
the Hermitian shaking, an avoided crossing of quasi-energies is observed at odd
resonances and nonadiabatic transitions between the two bound states, resulting
in Rabi flopping, can be explained as a multiphoton resonance process. For the
complex oscillating potential well, breakdown of adiabaticity arises from the
appearance of Floquet exceptional points at exact quasi energy crossing.

strong burst of star formation followed by a galactic wind which quenches star
formation. Models with fixed IMF failed in simultaneously reproducing the
observed trends with the galactic mass. So, we tested a varying IMF; contrary
to the diffused claim that the IMF should become bottom heavier in more massive
galaxies, we find a better agreement with data by assuming an inverse trend,
where the IMF goes from being bottom heavy in less massive galaxies to top
heavy in more massive ones. This naturally produces a downsizing in star
formation, favoring massive stars in largest galaxies. Finally, we tested the
use of the Integrated Galactic IMF, obtained by averaging the canonical IMF
over the mass distribution function of the clusters where star formation is
assumed to take place. We combined two prescriptions, valid for different SFR
regimes, to obtain the IGIMF values along the whole evolution of the galaxies

they have an offset relative to the data. We conclude that bottom-heavier IMFs
do not reproduce the properties of the most massive ellipticals, at variance

for classifying user phone call behavior (i.e., accept, reject, missed and

accuracy may decrease and the complexity of the classifiers may increase due to
the number of redundant training samples. To detect such noisy instances from a
training dataset, researchers use naive Bayes classifier (NBC) as it identifies
misclassified instances by taking into account independence assumption and
conditional probabilities of the attributes. However, some of these
misclassified instances might indicate usages behavioral patterns of individual
mobile phone users. Existing naive Bayes classifier based noise detection
techniques have not considered this issue and, thus, are lacking in

effectively identify noisy instances from the training dataset by analyzing the
behavioral patterns of individuals. We dynamically determine a noise threshold
according to individual's unique behavioral patterns by using both the naive
Bayes classifier and Laplace estimator. We use this noise threshold to identify
noisy instances. To measure the effectiveness of our technique in classifying
user phone call behavior, we employ the most popular classification algorithm

Electroencephalogram (EEG) have been studied. Three different groups of images
with three familiarity levels of ""unfamiliar"", ""familiar"" and ""very familiar""
have been considered for this study. EEG signals of 21 subjects (14 men) were
recorded. After signal acquisition, pre-processing, including noise and
artifact removal, were performed on epochs of data. Features, including
spatial-statistical, wavelet, frequency and harmonic parameters, and also
correlation between recording channels, were extracted from the data. Then, we
evaluated the efficiency of the extracted features by using p-value and also an
orthogonal feature selection method (combination of Gram-Schmitt method and
Fisher discriminant ratio) for feature dimensional reduction. As the final step
of feature selection, we used 'add-r take-away l' method for choosing the most
discriminative features. For data classification, including all two-class and
three-class cases, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the extracted
features. The correct classification rates (CCR) for ""unfamiliar-familiar"",
""unfamiliar-very familiar"" and ""familiar-very familiar"" cases were 85.6%,
92.6%, and 70.6%, respectively. The best results of classifications were
obtained in pre-frontal and frontal regions of brain. Also, wavelet, frequency
and harmonic features were among the most discriminative features. Finally, in
three-class case, the best CCR was 86.8%.

problem is formulated to find the volume of the object graspable by the robot's
hand using its stereo vision; II) a recursive Bayesian filtering technique,

demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of our approach with extensive

of geo-replication to attain low latency and high availability. Conflict-free
Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) allow the design of predictable multi-master
replication and support eventual consistency of replicas that are allowed to
transiently diverge. CRDTs come in two flavors: state-based, where a state is
changed locally and shipped and merged into other replicas; operation-based,
where operations are issued locally and reliably causal broadcast to all other
replicas. However, the standard definition of op-based CRDTs is very
encompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, and thus imposing storage
and dissemination overheads as well as blurring the distinction from
state-based CRDTs. We introduce pure op-based CRDTs, that can only send
operations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based
ones. Data types with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as
pure op-based CRDTs using standard reliable causal delivery; whereas data types
having non-commutative operations are implemented using a PO-Log, a partially
ordered log of operations, and making use of an extended API, i.e., a Tagged
Causal Stable Broadcast (TCSB), that provides extra causality information upon
delivery and later informs when delivered messages become causally stable,
allowing further PO-Log compaction. The framework is illustrated by a catalog
of pure op-based specifications for classic CRDTs, including counters,
multi-value registers, add-wins and remove-wins sets.

construction and pattern matching are important tasks when dealing with
property graphs. Given a property graph schema S, a property graph G, and a
query pattern P, all expressed in language L, pattern matching is the process
of finding, merging, and annotating subgraphs of G that match P. Expressive
pattern languages support topological constraints, property values constraints,
negations, quantifications, aggregations, and path semantics. Calculated
properties may be defined for vertices, edges, and subgraphs, and constraints
may be imposed on their evaluation result.
  Query posers would like to construct patterns with minimal effort, minimal
trial and error, and in a manner that is coherent with the way they think. The
ability to express patterns in a way that is aligned with their mental
processes is crucial to the flow of their work and to the quality of the
insights they can draw.
  Since the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to pattern
perception are remarkable, it is a matter of course that query patterns were to
be expressed visually. Visual query languages have the potential to be much
more 'user-friendly' than their textual counterparts in the sense that patterns
may be constructed and understood much more quickly and with much less mental
effort. A long-standing challenge is to design a visual query language that is
generic, has rich expressive power, and is highly receptive and productive. V1
attempts to answer this challenge.
  V1 is a declarative visual pattern query language for schema-based property
graphs. V1 supports property graphs with mixed (both directed and undirected)
edges and unary edges, with multivalued and composite properties, and with null
property values. V1 is generic, concise, has rich expressive power, and is
highly receptive and productive.

formalism to a fluid of dissipative, randomly driven granular particles. The
stress relaxation function is computed approximately within a mode-coupling
theory---based on the physical picture, that relaxation of shear is dominated
by slow structural relaxation, as the glass transition is approached. The
transient build-up of stress in steady shear is thus traced back to transient
density correlations which are computed self-consistently within mode-coupling
theory. The glass transition is signalled by the appearance of a yield stress
and a divergence of the Newtonian viscosity, characterizing linear response.
For shear rates comparable to the structural relaxation time, the stress
becomes independent of shear rate and we observe shear thinning, while for the
largest shear rates Bagnold scaling, i.e., a quadratic increase of shear stress
with shear rate, is recovered. The rheological properties are qualitatively
similar for all values of $\varepsilon$, the coefficient of restitution;
however, the magnitude of the stress as well as the range of shear thinning and
thickening show significant dependence on the inelasticity.

from stars with mass $M_{\star}=(0.6-0.8)M_{\odot}$ and metallicity
$Z=(0-1)Z_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$ are the solar mass and
metallicity, respectively. \Alfvenic waves, which are excited by the surface
convection, travel upward from the photosphere and heat up the corona by their
dissipation. For lower $Z$, denser gas can be heated up to the coronal
temperature because of the inefficient radiation cooling. The coronal density
of Pop.II/III stars with $Z\le 0.01Z_{\odot}$ is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger
than that of the solar-metallicity star with the same mass, and as a result,
the mass loss rate, $\dot{M}$, is $(4.5-20)$ times larger. This indicates that
metal accretion on low-mass Pop.III stars is negligible. The soft X-ray flux of
the Pop.II/III stars is also expected to be $\approx (1-30)$ times larger than
that of the solar-metallicity counterpart owing to the larger coronal density,
even though the radiation cooling efficiency is smaller. A larger fraction of
the input \Alfvenic wave energy is transmitted to the corona in low $Z$ stars
because they avoid severe reflection owing to the smaller density difference
between the photosphere and the corona. Therefore, a larger fraction is
converted to the thermal energy of the corona and the kinetic energy of the
stellar wind. From this energetics argument, we finally derived a scaling of
$\dot{M}$ as $\dot{M}\propto L R_{\star}^{11/9}M_{\star}^{-10/9}T_{\rm

for quantum state generation with Lyapunov control. The strategy is to add
target-state-related coherent control fields into the dissipation process to
intuitively improve the evolution speed. By applying the current approach,
without losing the advantages of dissipation dynamics, the target stationary
states can be generated in a much shorter time as compared to that via
traditional dissipation dynamics. As a result, the current approach containing
the advantages of coherent unitary dynamics and dissipation dynamics allows for
significant improvement in quantum state generation.

the dynamical cosmological backgrounds of dust, radiation, quintessence,

arise relative to the case of Schwarzschild black hole. Also, we address some
of the subclasses of the obtained surrounded black hole solution for both

according to their behaviors under imposing the positive energy condition and
discuss how this condition imposes some severe and important restrictions on

originate from the low-mass end of progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}~=
8-12~M_\odot$. However, degeneracy effects make stellar evolution modelling of
such stars challenging, and few predictions for their supernova light curves
and spectra have been presented. Here we calculate synthetic nebular spectra of
a 9 $M_\odot$ Fe CCSN model exploded with the neutrino mechanism. The model
predicts emission lines with FWHM$\sim$1000 km/s, including signatures from
each deep layer in the metal core. We compare this model to observations of the
three subluminous IIP SNe with published nebular spectra; SN 1997D, SN 2005cs,
and SN 2008bk. The prediction of both line profiles and luminosities are in
good agreement with SN 1997D and SN 2008bk. The close fit of a model with no
tuning parameters provides strong evidence for an association of these objects
with low-mass Fe CCSNe. For SN 2005cs, the interpretation is less clear, as the
observational coverage ended before key diagnostic lines from the core had
emerged. We perform a parameterised study of the amount of explosively made
stable nickel, and find that none of these three SNe show the high
$^{58}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni ratio predicted by current models of electron capture SNe
(ECSNe) and ECSN-like explosions. Combined with clear detection of lines from O
and He shell material, these SNe rather originate from Fe core progenitors. We
argue that the outcome of self-consistent explosion simulations of low-mass
stars, which gives fits to many key observables, strongly suggests that the
class of subluminous Type IIP SNe is the observational counterpart of the
lowest mass CCSNe.

$H$, the number of $H$-free graphs on a given set of $n$ vertices. In the case
when $H$ is not bipartite, fairly precise estimates on this number are known.
In particular, thirty years ago, Erd\H{o}s, Frankl, and R\""odl proved that
there are $2^{(1+o(1))\text{ex}(n,H)}$ such graphs. In the bipartite case,
however, nontrivial bounds have been proven only for relatively few special
graphs $H$.
  We make a first attempt at addressing this enumeration problem for a general
bipartite graph $H$. We show that an upper bound of $2^{O(\text{ex}(n,H))}$ on
the number of $H$-free graphs with $n$ vertices follows merely from a rather
natural assumption on the growth rate of $n \mapsto \text{ex}(n,H)$; an
analogous statement remains true when $H$ is a uniform hypergraph.
Subsequently, we derive several new results, along with most previously known
estimates, as simple corollaries of our theorem. At the heart of our proof lies
a general supersaturation statement that extends the seminal work of Erd\H{o}s
and Simonovits. The bounds on the number of $H$-free hypergraphs are derived
from it using the method of hypergraph containers.

quasar ages, and quasar obscuration. We post-process outputs from a

$\Omega_\mathrm{obsc}$ of the foreground quasar, and explore the resulting
effect on the HeII transverse proximity effect signal. Fluctuations in IGM
density and the UV background, as well as the unknown orientation of the

the large scale cloud structures in the galaxy. We use the newly estimated
distances obtained from the parallaxes measured by the Gaia satellite and
included in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution catalog. When known members of
a region are included in this catalog we use their parallaxes to infer the
distance to the cloud. Otherwise, we analyze the dependence of the color excess
on the distance of the stars and look for a turn-on of this excess, which is a
proxy of the position of the front-edge of the star-forming cloud. We are able
to measure the distance to the three Chamaeleon clouds. The distance to
Chamaeleon I is 179 pc, 20 pc further away than previously assumed. The
Chamaeleon II cloud is located at the distance of 181 pc, which agrees with
previous estimates. We are able to measure for the first time a distance to the
Chamaeleon III cloud of 199 pc. Finally, the distance of the Musca cloud is
smaller than 603 pc. These estimates do not allow us to distinguish between the
possibility that the Chamaeleon clouds are part of a sheet of clouds parallel
to the galactic plane, or perpendicular to it. Gaia Data Release 2 will allow
us to put more stringent constraints on the distances to these clouds by giving
us access to parallax measurements for a larger number of members of these
regions.

projected rotation velocity (vsini) and rotation period are both available. By
combining estimates of v and vsini, we find nearly all the stars to be
compatible with high inclination, and hence, low obliquity (less than about 20
degrees). Second, we focus on a sample of 159 hot stars (> 6000K) for which
vsini is available but not necessarily the rotation period. We find 6 stars for
which vsini is anomalously low, an indicator of high obliquity. Half of these
have hot Jupiters, even though only 3% of the stars that were searched have hot
Jupiters. We also compare the vsini distribution of the hot stars with planets
to that of 83 control stars selected without prior knowledge of planets. The
mean vsini of the control stars is lower than that of the planet hosts by a
factor of approximately pi/4, as one would expect if the planet hosts have low

mechanical and chemical feedback of the most massive stars and determine
whether they end their lives as neutron stars or black holes. In this work we
investigate theoretically the mass-loss properties of H-free WR stars of the
nitrogen sequence (WN stars). We connect stellar structure models for He stars
with wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models
can simultaneously fulfill their respective sonic-point conditions. Fixing the
outer wind law and terminal wind velocity, we obtain unique solutions for the
mass-loss rates of optically-thick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the
phase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of
stellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore,
we encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist.
While these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they
are in conflict with observations in the LMC. While our results confirm in
particular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that
only part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of
the standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core.
This means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind
structure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have
to be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of
WR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in
binary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae.
The sonic-point conditions derived in this work may provide a possibility to
include optically-thick winds in stellar evolution models in a more physically
motivated form than in current models.

that CeCoIn$_5$ is an unconventional superconductor in the strong coupling

is reduced with respect to a pure BCS spectra and therefore the coupling of
quasiparticles with spin excitations should play a relevant role. In addition,
the tunneling conductance shows a depletion at energies smaller than $\Delta$
for temperatures larger than the bulk $T_{\rm c}$, giving further support to
the existence of a pseudogap phase that in our samples span up to $T^{*}\sim
1.2 T_{\rm c}$. The phenomenological scaling of the pseudogap temperature
observed in various families of cuprates, $2\Delta/kT^{*} \sim 4.3 $, is not

active layer can offer technological advantages in terms of robustness to
processing solvents. This is particularly relevant in field-effect transistors
(FET), where processing of dielectrics or barriers from solution on top of the
semiconductor layer typically imposes the use of orthogonal solvents in order
not to interfere with the nanometer thick accumulation channel. To this end,
the use of latent pigments, highly soluble molecules which can produce
insoluble films after a post-deposition thermal cleavage of solubilizing
groups, is a very promising strategy. In this contribution, we demonstrate the
use of tert-Butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) functionalized diketopyrrolopyrrole and
perylene-diimide small molecules for good hole and electron transporting films.
t-Boc thermal cleavage produces a densification of the films, along with a
strong structural rearrangement of the deprotected molecules, strongly
improving charge mobility in both p- and n-type FET. We also highlight the
robustness of these highly insoluble semiconducting layers to typical and
aggressive processing solvents. These results can greatly enhance the degree of
freedom in the manufacturing of multi-layered organic electronic devices,
offering enhanced stability to harsh processing steps.

opportunities for grid-connected energy storage. Batteries offer significant
flexibility but are relatively expensive at present. Battery lifetime is a key
factor in the business case, and it depends on usage, but most techno-economic
analyses do not account for this. For the first time, this paper quantifies the
annual benefits of grid-connected batteries including realistic physical
dynamics and nonlinear electrochemical degradation. Three lithium-ion battery
models of increasing realism are formulated, and the predicted degradation of
each is compared with a large-scale experimental degradation data set
(Mat4Bat). A respective improvement in RMS capacity prediction error from 11\%
to 5\% is found by increasing the model accuracy. The three models are then
used within an optimal control algorithm to perform price arbitrage over one
year, including degradation. Results show that the revenue can be increased
substantially while degradation can be reduced by using more realistic models.
The estimated best case profit using a sophisticated model is a 175%
improvement compared with the simplest model. This illustrates that using a
simplistic battery model in a techno-economic assessment of grid-connected

erroneous conclusions.

randomly over a large area in order to monitor a designated air space. To
increase the lifetime of the network, the density of distributed sensors could
be such that a subset of sensors can cover the required air space. As a sensor
dies another sensor should be selected to compensate for the dead one and
reestablish the complete coverage. This process should be continued until
complete coverage is not achievable by the existing sensors. Thereafter, a
graceful degradation of the coverage is desirable. The goal is to elongate the
lifetime of the network while maintaining a maximum possible coverage of the

heuristics for this case. This is done by prioritizing the sensors based on

proposed to detect abrupt changes arising in the full distribution of the

enjoy good statistical properties (oracle inequality, \ldots). Nonetheless,
they have a high computational cost both in terms of time and memory. This
makes their application difficult even for small and medium sample sizes ($n<
10^4$). This computational issue is addressed by first describing a new
efficient and exact algorithm for kernel multiple change-point detection with
an improved worst-case complexity that is quadratic in time and linear in
space. It allows dealing with medium size signals (up to $n \approx 10^5$).
Second, a faster but approximation algorithm is described. It is based on a
low-rank approximation to the Gram matrix. It is linear in time and space. This
approximation algorithm can be applied to large-scale signals ($n \geq 10^6$).
These exact and approximation algorithms have been implemented in \texttt{R}
and \texttt{C} for various kernels. The computational and statistical
performances of these new algorithms have been assessed through empirical
experiments. The runtime of the new algorithms is observed to be faster than
that of other considered procedures. Finally, simulations confirmed the higher
statistical accuracy of kernel-based approaches to detect changes that are not
only in the mean. These simulations also illustrate the flexibility of
kernel-based approaches to analyze complex biological profiles made of DNA copy

toral periods. The crux is a geometric expansion of the cross-correlation
between the periodic measure on a torus orbit and a Hecke correspondence,
expressing it as a short shifted convolution sum. The latter is bounded from
above generalizing the method of Shiu and Nair to polynomials in two variables
on smooth domains.

of the random effects and finite random series of tensor products of B-splines
priors on the underlying graphon functions. Markov chain Monte Carlo

encoded Clifford group over the engineered error-free stabilizer subspace to
obtain average error for arbitrary logically-encoded gates and algorithms. In
the case of benchmarking simulation of physical systems, these can have various
exotic symmetries over which one-design strategies can nonetheless be
constructed. We give examples for fermionic systems which conserve particle
number, as well as for the Fermi-Hubbard model. The symmetry benchmarking

less than 0.05 Eddington luminosity, even for an extreme Kerr black hole, which
is insufficient for the observed strong jets in some blazars with jet power
$\sim 0.1-1$ Eddington luminosity (or even higher). It implies that these

solution transforms a given Petri net into another net whose transitions are
the transactions of the s-cells and whose places are those of the original net,
with some auxiliary structure for bookkeeping. The resulting net is
confusion-free, and thus conflicting alternatives can be equipped with
probabilistic choices, while nonintersecting alternatives are purely concurrent
and their probability distributions are independent. The validity of the
construction is witnessed by a tight correspondence with the recursively
stopped configurations of Abbes and Benveniste. Some advantages of our approach
are that: i) s-cells are defined statically and locally in a compositional way;
ii) our resulting nets faithfully account for concurrency.

the corrections in the Kondo regime at zero magnetic field. The contribution of
the three-body fluctuations become significant far away from half-filling,
especially in the valence-fluctuation regime and empty-orbital regimes. In
finite magnetic fields, the three-body contributions become comparable to the

Shin","Mobile IMUs Reveal Driver's Identity From Vehicle Turns","15 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As vehicle maneuver data becomes abundant for assisted or autonomous driving,
their implication of privacy invasion/leakage has become an increasing concern.
In particular, the surface for fingerprinting a driver will expand
significantly if the driver's identity can be linked with the data collected
from his mobile or wearable devices which are widely deployed worldwide and
have increasing sensing capabilities. In line with this trend, this paper
investigates a fast emerging driving data source that has driver's privacy
implications. We first show that such privacy threats can be materialized via
any mobile device with IMUs (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer). We then
present Dri-Fi (Driver Fingerprint), a driving data analytic engine that can
fingerprint the driver with vehicle turn(s). Dri-Fi achieves this based on IMUs
data taken only during the vehicle's turn(s). Such an approach expands the
attack surface significantly compared to existing driver fingerprinting
schemes. From this data, Dri-Fi extracts three new features --- acceleration
along the end-of-turn axis, its deviation, and the deviation of the yaw rate
--- and exploits them to identify the driver. Our extensive evaluation shows
that an adversary equipped with Dri-Fi can correctly fingerprint the driver
within just one turn with 74.1%, 83.5%, and 90.8% accuracy across 12, 8, and 5
drivers --- typical of an immediate family or close-friends circle ---
respectively. Moreover, with measurements on more than one turn, the adversary
can achieve up to 95.3%, 95.4%, and 96.6% accuracy across 12, 8, and 5 drivers,
respectively.

success. We show that efficient trade-off between these two measurements for
investment portfolios happens, in general, on a convex curve in the two
dimensional space of utility and risk. This is a rather general pattern. The
modern portfolio theory of Markowitz [H. Markowitz, Portfolio Selection, 1959]
and its natural generalization, the capital market pricing model, [W. F.
Sharpe, Mutual fund performance , 1966] are special cases of our general
framework when the risk measure is taken to be the standard deviation and the
utility function is the identity mapping. Using our general framework, we also
recover the results in [R. T. Rockafellar, S. Uryasev and M. Zabarankin, Master
funds in portfolio analysis with general deviation measures, 2006] that extends
the capital market pricing model to allow for the use of more general deviation
measures. This generalized capital asset pricing model also applies to e.g.
when an approximation of the maximum drawdown is considered as a risk measure.
Furthermore, the consideration of a general utility function allows to go
beyond the ""additive"" performance measure to a ""multiplicative"" one of
cumulative returns by using the log utility. As a result, the growth optimal
portfolio theory [J. Lintner, The valuation of risk assets and the selection of
risky investments in stock portfolios and capital budgets, 1965] and the
leverage space portfolio theory [R. Vince, The Leverage Space Trading Model,
2009] can also be understood under our general framework. Thus, this general
framework allows a unification of several important existing portfolio theories
and goes much beyond.

Spectrometer (SXS) on board Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structure
of spatially resolved emission lines from highly ionized ions in galaxy
clusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we have
measured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperature
structure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show that
when inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems like
Perseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. In
the Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\alpha$ line ($w$) - the
strongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line is
suppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions for
an optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from the
center. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from the
same ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distance
dependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonant
scattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in optically
thick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\beta$, Ly$\alpha$) lines, and
comparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results are
consistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadening
described elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statistical
uncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions of
line emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-ray
missions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on the
amplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.

explore the relations between the amount of silicon required to be locked up in
silicates [Si/H]_{dust} and the 2175 Angstrom bump or the far-UV extinction
rise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 46 Galactic
sightlines for which the gas-phase silicon abundance [Si/H]_{gas} is known. We
derive [Si/H]_{dust} either from {[Si/H]_{ISM} - [Si/H]_{gas}} or from the
Kramers-Kronig relation which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to
the total dust volume, where [Si/H]_{ISM} is the interstellar silicon reference
abundance and taken to be that of proto-Sun or B stars. We also derive
[Si/H]_{dust} from fitting the observed extinction curves with a mixture of
amorphous silicates and graphitic grains. We find that in all three cases
[Si/H]_{dust} shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom bump, while the
carbon depletion [C/H]_{dust} tends to correlate with the 2175 Angstrom bump.
This supports carbon grains instead of silicates as the possible carrier of the
2175 Angstrom bump. We also find that neither [Si/H]_{dust} nor [C/H]_{dust}
alone correlates with the far-UV extinction, suggesting that the far-UV
extinction is a combined effect of small carbon grains and silicates.

organization by extracting knowledge from event logs and by offering techniques
to discover, monitor and enhance real processes. In the discovery of process
models, retrieving a complex one, i.e., a hardly readable process model, can
hinder the extraction of information. Even in well-structured process models,
there is information that cannot be obtained with the current techniques. In
this paper, we present WoMine, an algorithm to retrieve frequent behavioural
patterns from the model. Our approach searches in process models extracting
structures with sequences, selections, parallels and loops, which are
frequently executed in the logs. This proposal has been validated with a set of
process models, including some from BPI Challenges, and compared with the state
of the art techniques. Experiments have validated that WoMine can find all
types of patterns, extracting information that cannot be mined with the state
of the art techniques.

  ILLSS generally",,,,"cs.CV q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The color sensation evoked by an object depends on both the spectral power
distribution of the illumination and the reflectance properties of the object
being illuminated. The color sensation can be characterized by three
color-space values, such as XYZ, RGB, HSV, L*a*b*, etc. It is straightforward
to compute the three values given the illuminant and reflectance curves. The
converse process of computing a reflectance curve given the color-space values
and the illuminant is complicated by the fact that an infinite number of
different reflectance curves can give rise to a single set of color-space
values (metamerism). This paper presents five algorithms for generating a
reflectance curve from a specified sRGB triplet, written for a general
audience. The algorithms are designed to generate reflectance curves that are
similar to those found with naturally occurring colored objects. The computed
reflectance curves are compared to a database of thousands of reflectance
curves measured from paints and pigments available both commercially and in
nature, and the similarity is quantified. One particularly useful application
of these algorithms is in the field of computer graphics, where modeling color
transformations sometimes requires wavelength-specific information, such as
when modeling subtractive color mixture.

cylinder under radial oscillations. For this purpose, we follow the Eulerian
and Lagrangian approaches to evaluate linearized perturbed equation of motion.
We formulate perturbed pressure in terms of adiabatic index by applying the
conservation of baryon numbers. A variational principle is established to
determine characteristic frequencies of oscillation which define stability
criteria for gaseous cylinder. We compute the ranges of radii as well as
adiabatic index for both charged and uncharged cases in Newtonian and
post-Newtonian limits. We conclude that dynamical instability occurs in the
presence of charge if the gaseous cylinder contracts to the radius $R_{*}$.

corpora, humans learn language in a different way: by being grounded in an
environment and interacting with other humans. In this work, we propose a
communication game where two agents, native speakers of their own respective
languages, jointly learn to solve a visual referential task. We find that the
ability to understand and translate a foreign language emerges as a means to
achieve shared goals. The emergent translation is interactive and multimodal,
and crucially does not require parallel corpora, but only monolingual,
independent text and corresponding images. Our proposed translation model
achieves this by grounding the source and target languages into a shared visual
modality, and outperforms several baselines on both word-level and
sentence-level translation tasks. Furthermore, we show that agents in a
multilingual community learn to translate better and faster than in a bilingual
communication setting.

  domain-specific natural language question answering","20 opages",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speech-based natural language question-answering interfaces to enterprise
systems are gaining a lot of attention. General-purpose speech engines can be
integrated with NLP systems to provide such interfaces. Usually,
general-purpose speech engines are trained on large `general' corpus. However,
when such engines are used for specific domains, they may not recognize
domain-specific words well, and may produce erroneous output. Further, the
accent and the environmental conditions in which the speaker speaks a sentence
may induce the speech engine to inaccurately recognize certain words. The
subsequent natural language question-answering does not produce the requisite
results as the question does not accurately represent what the speaker
intended. Thus, the speech engine's output may need to be adapted for a domain
before further natural language processing is carried out. We present two
mechanisms for such an adaptation, one based on evolutionary development and
the other based on machine learning, and show how we can repair the
speech-output to make the subsequent natural language question-answering
better.

quantum mechanics, where the complexity of the ground state appears to grow
exponentially with the size of the system. We address this problem with
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques: adversarial domain adaptation. We
derive the phase diagram of the whole parameter space starting from a fixed and
known subspace using unsupervised learning. The input data set contains both
labeled and unlabeled data instances. The first kind is a system that admits an
accurate analytical or numerical solution, and one can recover its phase
diagram. The second type is the physical system with an unknown phase diagram.
Adversarial domain adaptation uses both types of data to create invariant
feature extracting layers in a deep learning architecture. Once these layers
are trained, we can attach an unsupervised learner to the network to find phase
transitions. We show the success of this technique by applying it on several
paradigmatic models: the Ising model with different temperatures, the
Bose-Hubbard model, and the SSH model with disorder. The input is the ground
state without any manual feature engineering, and the dimension of the
parameter space is unrestricted. The method finds unknown transitions
successfully and predicts transition points in close agreement with standard
methods. This study opens the door to the classification of physical systems
where the phases boundaries are complex such as the many-body localization
problem or the Bose glass phase.

not govern the motion of individual particles but the evolution of the
distances between particles. Its formulation gives a satisfactory answer to
Leibniz's and Mach's criticisms of Newton's mechanics: relational mechanics
does not rely on the idea of an absolute space. When describing the behavior of
small subsystems with respect to the so called ""fixed stars"", relational
mechanics basically agrees with Newtonian mechanics. However, those subsystems
having huge angular momenta will deviate from the Newtonian behavior if they
are described in the frame of fixed stars. Such subsystems naturally belong to
the field of astronomy; they can be used to test the relational theory.
