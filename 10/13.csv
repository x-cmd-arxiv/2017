  Noise Transforms","Presented at the 55th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication,
  Control, and Computing, 2017",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multilayer (or deep) networks are powerful probabilistic models based on
multiple stages of a linear transform followed by a non-linear (possibly
random) function. In general, the linear transforms are defined by matrices and
the non-linear functions are defined by information channels. These models have
gained great popularity due to their ability to characterize complex
probabilistic relationships arising in a wide variety of inference problems.
The contribution of this paper is a new method for analyzing the fundamental
limits of statistical inference in settings where the model is known. The
validity of our method can be established in a number of settings and is
conjectured to hold more generally. A key assumption made throughout is that
the matrices are drawn randomly from orthogonally invariant distributions.
  Our method yields explicit formulas for 1) the mutual information; 2) the
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE); 3) the existence and locations of certain
phase-transitions with respect to the problem parameters; and 4) the stationary
points for the state evolution of approximate message passing algorithms. When
applied to the special case of models with multivariate Gaussian channels our
method is rigorous and has close connections to free probability theory for
random matrices. When applied to the general case of non-Gaussian channels, our
method provides a simple alternative to the replica method from statistical
physics. A key observation is that the combined effects of the individual
components in the model (namely the matrices and the channels) are additive
when viewed in a certain transform domain.

that have taken the research of two-dimensional relativistic condensed matter
systems to prolific levels. However, the understanding of how its nonlinear
optical properties are affected by relativistic-like effects has been broadly
uncharted. It has been recently shown that highly-nontrivial currents can be
generated in free-standing samples, notably leading to the generation of even
harmonics. Since graphene monolayers are centrosymmetric media, for which such
harmonic generation is deemed inaccessible, this light-driven phenomenon is
both startling and promising. More realistically, graphene samples are often
deposited on a dielectric substrate, leading to additional intricate
interactions. Here, we present a treatment to study this instance by gapping
the spectrum and we show this leads to the appearance of a Berry phase in the
carrier dynamics. We analyse the role of such a phase in the generated
nonlinear current and conclude that it suppresses odd-harmonic generation. The
pump energy can be tuned to the energy gap to yield interference among odd
harmonics mediated by interband transitions, allowing even harmonics to be
generated. Our results and general methodology pave the way for understanding
the role of gap-opening physical factors in the nonlinear optics of hexagonal
two-dimensional lattices.

  Sparsification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The eigendeomposition of nearest-neighbor (NN) graph Laplacian matrices is
the main computational bottleneck in spectral clustering. In this work, we
introduce a highly-scalable, spectrum-preserving graph sparsification algorithm
that enables to build ultra-sparse NN (u-NN) graphs with guaranteed
preservation of the original graph spectrums, such as the first few
eigenvectors of the original graph Laplacian. Our approach can immediately lead
to scalable spectral clustering of large data networks without sacrificing
solution quality. The proposed method starts from constructing low-stretch
spanning trees (LSSTs) from the original graphs, which is followed by
iteratively recovering small portions of ""spectrally critical"" off-tree edges
to the LSSTs by leveraging a spectral off-tree embedding scheme. To determine
the suitable amount of off-tree edges to be recovered to the LSSTs, an
eigenvalue stability checking scheme is proposed, which enables to robustly
preserve the first few Laplacian eigenvectors within the sparsified graph.
Additionally, an incremental graph densification scheme is proposed for
identifying extra edges that have been missing in the original NN graphs but
can still play important roles in spectral clustering tasks. Our experimental
results for a variety of well-known data sets show that the proposed method can
dramatically reduce the complexity of NN graphs, leading to significant
speedups in spectral clustering.

the theoretical design of a unified reduced- order model for the description of
two regimes: a disperse phase in a carrier fluid and two separated phases. The
first idea is to propose a statistical description of the in- terface relying
on geometrical properties such as the mean and Gauss curvatures and define a
Surface Density Function (SDF). The second main idea consists in using such a
formalism in the disperse case, where a clear link is proposed between local
statistics of the interface and the statistics on objects, such as the number
density function in Williams-Boltzmann equation for droplets. This makes
essential the use of topolog- ical invariants in geometry through the
Gauss-Bonnet formula and allows to include the works conducted on sprays of
spherical droplets. It yields a statistical treatment of populations of
non-spherical objects such as ligaments, as long as they are home- omorphic to
a sphere. Second, it provides an original angle and algorithm in order to build
statistics from DNS data of interfacial flows. From the theoretical approach,
we identify a kernel for the spatial averaging of geometrical quantities
preserving the topological invariants. Coupled to a new algorithm for the
evaluation of curvatures and surface that preserves these invariants, we
analyze two sets of DNS results conducted with the ARCHER code from CORIA with

interrupt communication to resolve contention which reduces network throughput

measurements per week for circumpolar objects. Nearly 80 percent of the sources
display variability greater than 10 per cent on a time-scale between a week and
a few years but about three quarters of the sample have only 1-3 spectral
features which vary significantly. Irregular intensity fluctuation is the
dominant type of variability and only nine objects show evidence for cyclic
variations with periods of 120 to 416 d. Synchronised and anti-correlated
variations of maser features are detected in four sources with a disc-like
morphology. Rapid and high amplitude bursts of individual features are seen on
3-5 occasions in five sources. Long (>50 d to 20 months) lasting bursts are
observed mostly for individual or groups of features in 19 sources and only one
source experienced a remarkable global flare. A few flaring features display a
strong anti-correlation between intensity and line-width that is expected for
unsaturated amplification. There is a weak anti-correlation between the maser
feature luminosity and variability measure, i.e. maser features with low
luminosity tend to be more variable than those with high luminosity. The
analysis of the spectral energy distribution and continuum radio emission
reveals that the variability of the maser features increases when the
bolometric luminosity and Lyman flux of the exciting object decreases. Our
results support the concept of a major role for infrared pumping photons in
triggering outburst activity of maser emission.

the fit to the polarized SED. Dust models based on astrosilicates can be
reconciled with Planck data by adapting the shape of grains and adding
inclusions of porosity or a-C in the astrosilicate matrix.

minimized over a polyhedral set and the $\ell_0$-norm regularizer implicitly
emphasizes sparsity of the solution. Such a setting captures a range of
problems in image processing and statistical learning. Given the nonconvex and
discontinuous nature of this norm, convex regularizers are often employed as
substitutes. Therefore, far less is known about directly solving the
$\ell_0$-minimization problem. Inspired by [19], we consider resolving an
equivalent formulation of the $\ell_0$-minimization problem as a mathematical
program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) and make the following
contributions towards the characterization and computation of its KKT points:
(i) First, we show that feasible points of this formulation satisfy the
relatively weak Guignard constraint qualification. Furthermore, under the
suitable convexity assumption on $f(x)$, an equivalence is derived between
first-order KKT points and local minimizers of the MPCC formulation. (ii) Next,
we apply two alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithms to
exploit special structure of the MPCC formulation: (ADMM$_{\rm cf}^{\mu,
\alpha, \rho}$) and (ADMM$_{\rm cf}$). These two ADMM schemes both have
tractable subproblems. Specifically, in spite of the overall nonconvexity, we
show that the first of the ADMM updates can be effectively reduced to a
closed-form expression by recognizing a hidden convexity property while the
second necessitates solving a convex program. In (ADMM$_{\rm cf}^{\mu, \alpha,
\rho}$), we prove subsequential convergence to a perturbed KKT point under mild
assumptions. Our preliminary numerical experiments suggest that the tractable
ADMM schemes are more scalable than their standard counterpart and ADMM$_{\rm
cf}$ compares well with its competitors to solve the $\ell_0$-minimization
problem.

different from the other LSB galaxies, in that they are significantly more
elongated and extended, whereas the smaller UDGs differ from the LSB dwarfs
only by their effective radii. We do not find clear differences between the
structural parameters of the UDGs in our sample and those of UDGs in other
galaxy environments. We find that the dwarf LSB galaxies in our sample are less
concentrated in the cluster center than the galaxies with higher surface
brightness, and that their number density drops in the core of the cluster. Our
findings are consistent with the small UDGs forming the tail of a continuous
distribution of less extended LSB galaxies. However, the elongated and
distorted shapes of the large UDGs could imply that they are tidally disturbed

zone (HZ) around solar-type stars. In particular, we study different dynamical
environments that are defined by the most massive body in the system. Methods.
First of all, a semi-analytical model was used to define the mass of the
protoplanetary disks that produce each of the five dynamical scenarios of our
research. Then, we made use of the same semi-analytical model to describe the
evolution of embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase. Finally, we
carried out N-body simulations of planetary accretion in order to analyze the
formation and water delivery of planets in the HZ in the different dynamical
environments. Results. Water worlds are efficiently formed in the HZ in
different dynamical scenarios. In systems with a giant planet analog to Jupiter
or Saturn around the snow line, super-Earths tend to migrate into the HZ from
outside the snow line as a result of interactions with other embryos and
accrete water only during the gaseous phase. In systems without giant planets,
Earths and super-Earths with high water by mass contents can either be formed
in situ in the HZ or migrate into it from outer regions, and water can be
accreted during the gaseous phase and in collisions with water-rich embryos and
planetesimals. Conclusions. The formation of planets in the HZ with very high
water by mass contents seems to be a common process around Sun- like stars. Our
research suggests that such planets are still very efficiently produced in
different dynamical environments. Moreover, our study indicates that the
formation of planets in the HZ with masses and water contents similar to those
of Earth seems to be a rare process around solar-type stars in the systems
under consideration.

black holes have unlimited mass-spectrum, though the mass-gap between 2 -
5$M_\odot$, which applies for both classes, is evident and remains puzzling.
Based on the solution of the TOV equation modified to include a universal
scalar field $\phi$ at the background of supranuclear densities, we claim that
pulsars must be born with embryonic super-baryons (SBs), that form through the
merger of individual neutrons at their centers. The cores of SBs are made of
purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids (henceforth
SuSu-fluids). Such quantum fluids have a uniform supranuclear density and
governed by the critical EOSs for baryonic matter $P_b = \mathcal{E}_b$ and for
$\phi-$induced dark energy $P_\phi= -\mathcal{E}_\phi.$ The incompressibility
here ensures that particles communicate on the shortest possible timescale,
superfluidity and superconductivity enforce SBs to spin-down promptly as
dictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, whereas their lowest energy state
grants SBs lifetimes that are comparable to those of protons. The extraordinary
long lifetimes suggests that conglomeration of SuSu-objects would evolve over
several big bang events to possibly form dark matter halos that embed the
galaxies in the observable universe. Having pulsars been converted into
SuSu-objects, which is predicted to last for one Gyr or even shorter, then they
become extraordinary compact and turn invisible. It turns out that recent
observations on the quantum, stellar and cosmological scales remarkably support
the present scenario.

a bounded cylindrical domain with physical boundary condition is proved in

$H^m$ is obtained. These results seem rather difficult for the methods recently
developed in [8] and [10]. A completely different approach based on hydrostatic
helmholtz decomposition is presented, which can also be applied to cases with
other different boundary conditions. Several important results about

exhibit translational symmetry in two independent directions. There are exactly
$17$ distinct planar symmetry groups. We present a fully automatic method for
complete analysis of planar ornaments in $13$ of these groups, specifically,
the groups called $p6m, \, p6, \, p4g, \,p4m, \,p4, \, p31m, \,p3m, \, p3, \,

we present a method to simultaneously classify the input into one of the $13$
groups and extract the so called fundamental domain (FD), the minimum region
that is sufficient to reconstruct the entire ornament. A nice feature of our
method is that even when the given ornament image is a small portion such that
it does not contain multiple translational units, the symmetry group as well as
the fundamental domain can still be defined. This is because, in contrast to
common approach, we do not attempt to first identify a global translational
repetition lattice. Though the presented constructions work for quite a wide
range of ornament patterns, a key assumption we make is that the perceivable
motifs (shapes that repeat) alone do not provide clues for the underlying
symmetries of the ornament. In this sense, our main target is the planar
arrangements of asymmetric interlocking shapes, as in the symmetry art of
Escher.

shown that only a part of numerous contributions that appear in the general
expression for a two-leg graph can be considered as the true self-energy

constants; it is the only one that should be taken into account in the
conventional process of the summation of Dyson's chain that results in explicit
expression for the full propagator. The other parts provide the well-defined
finite corrections for the graphs with the number of legs n > 2. It is also
shown that there is no need to attract the renormalization prescriptions for
the higher derivatives of the two-leg function on the mass shell; the
requirements of finiteness and diagonability turn out to be quite sufficient.

physical realization of quantum error correcting codes (QECC) in their

has been argued that eigenstates of CFTs with a holographic dual should also
form QECCs. These two examples raise the question of how generally eigenstates
of many-body models form quantum codes. In this work we establish new
connections between quantum chaos and translation-invariance in many-body spin
systems, on one hand, and approximate quantum error correcting codes (AQECC),
on the other hand. We first observe that quantum chaotic systems exhibiting the
Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) have eigenstates forming approximate
quantum error-correcting codes. Then we show that AQECC can be obtained
probabilistically from translation-invariant energy eigenstates of every
translation-invariant spin chain, including integrable models. Applying this
result to 1D classical systems, we describe a method for using local symmetries
to construct parent Hamiltonians that embed these codes into the low-energy
subspace of gapless 1D quantum spin chains. As explicit examples we obtain
local AQECC in the ground space of the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg model and
the Motzkin spin chain model with periodic boundary conditions, thereby
yielding non-stabilizer codes in the ground space and low energy subspace of
physically plausible 1D gapless models.

game contributions over time. However, the effectiveness of punishment is
challenged by second-order freeriding and antisocial punishment. The latter
implies that non-cooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies
unwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here we extend the theory of
cooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing
strategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as
cooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show
that if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on
network reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public
cooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is
actively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does act
detrimental, but only if the cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are
relatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern
formation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are
thus effectively second-order freeriding on antisocial punishment, form an
active layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against
defectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is
sustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via
the same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary
outcomes can be explained by the comparison of invasion rates that determine
the stability of subsystem solutions. Our results reveal an unlikely
evolutionary escape from adverse effects of antisocial punishment, and they
provide a rationale for why second-order freeriding is not always an impediment
to the evolutionary stability of punishment.

studies this tension between cooperation and self-interest with a

image-level annotations are available for training object detectors. Numerous
methods have been proposed to tackle this problem through mining object
proposals. However, a substantial amount of noise in object proposals causes
ambiguities for learning discriminative object models. Such approaches are
sensitive to model initialization and often converge to undesirable local
minimum solutions. In this paper, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by
progressive representation adaptation with two main steps: 1) classification
adaptation and 2) detection adaptation. In classification adaptation, we
transfer a pre-trained network to a multi-label classification task for
recognizing the presence of a certain object in an image. Through the
classification adaptation step, the network learns discriminative
representations that are specific to object categories of interest. In
detection adaptation, we mine class-specific object proposals by exploiting two
scoring strategies based on the adapted classification network. Class-specific
proposal mining helps remove substantial noise from the background clutter and
potential confusion from similar objects. We further refine these proposals
using multiple instance learning and segmentation cues. Using these refined
object bounding boxes, we fine-tune all the layer of the classification network
and obtain a fully adapted detection network. We present detailed experimental
validation on the PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our progressive representation adaptation algorithm performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

expected to harden by dynamical friction and three-body stellar scatterings,
until emission of gravitational waves (GWs) leads to their final coalescence.
According to recent simulations, MBH binaries can efficiently harden via
stellar encounters only when the host geometry is triaxial, even if only
modestly, as angular momentum diffusion allows an efficient repopulation of the
binary loss cone. In this paper, we carry out a suite of N-body simulations of
equal-mass galaxy collisions, varying the initial orbits and density profiles
for the merging galaxies and running simulations both with and without central
MBHs. We find that the presence of an MBH binary in the remnant makes the
system nearly oblate, aligned with the galaxy merger plane, within a radius
enclosing 100 MBH masses. We never find binary hosts to be prolate on any
scale. The decaying MBHs slightly enhance the tangential anisotropy in the
centre of the remnant due to angular momentum injection and the slingshot
ejection of stars on nearly radial orbits. This latter effect results in about
1% of the remnant stars being expelled from the galactic nucleus. Finally, we
do not find any strong connection between the remnant morphology and the binary
hardening rate, which depends only on the inner density slope of the remnant
galaxy. Our results suggest that MBH binaries are able to coalesce within a few
Gyr, even if the binary is found to partially erase the merger-induced
triaxiality from the remnant.

feedback assumes a two-mode scenario in which the feedback from active galactic
nuclei occurs through a kinetic, comparatively efficient mode at low accretion
rates relative to the Eddington limit, and in the form of a thermal, less
efficient mode at high accretion rates. We show that the quenching of massive
central galaxies happens coincidently with kinetic-mode feedback, consistent
with the notion that active supermassive black cause the low specific star
formation rates observed in massive galaxies. However, major galaxy mergers are
not responsible for initiating most of the quenching events in our model. Up to
black hole masses of about $10^{8.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, the dominant growth
channel for SMBHs is in the thermal mode. Higher mass black holes stay mainly
in the kinetic mode and gas accretion is self-regulated via their feedback,
which causes their Eddington ratios to drop, with SMBH mergers becoming the
main channel for residual mass growth. As a consequence, the quasar luminosity
function is dominated by rapidly accreting, moderately massive black holes in
the thermal mode. We show that the associated growth history of SMBHs produces
a low-redshift quasar luminosity function and a redshift zero black hole
mass-stellar bulge mass relation in good agreement with observations, whereas
the simulation tends to over-predict the high-redshift quasar luminosity
function.

entropy index of the hot atmosphere falls below $\sim$1 Gyr or $\sim$35 keV

molecular gas condensed from hot atmospheres surrounding the central galaxies.
The depletion timescale of molecular gas due to star formation approaches 1 Gyr
in most systems. Yet ALMA images of roughly a half dozen systems drawn from
this sample suggest the molecular gas formed recently. We explore the origins
of thermally unstable cooling by evaluating whether molecular gas becomes
prevalent when the minimum of the cooling to free-fall time ratio ($t_{\rm

instead lie between $10 < min(t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}) < 25$, where $t_{\rm

thresholds $t_{\rm cool} \lesssim 1$ Gyr and 35 keV~cm$^2$, respectively, 2)
$min(t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$) is uncorrelated with molecular gas mass and jet
power, and 3) the narrow range $10 < min(t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}) < 25$ can be
explained by an observational selection effect. These results and the absence
of isentropic cores in cluster atmospheres are in tension with ""precipitation""

explanation. This object has several remarkable properties: (i) its prograde
orbit is ~100 km/s faster than the underlying Galactic rotation; (ii) its total
gas mass ($\gtrsim 4 \times 10^6 ~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) exceeds the mass of all
other high-velocity clouds (HVC) outside of the Magellanic Stream; (iii) its
head-tail morphology extends to the Galactic HI disc, indicating some sort of
interaction. The Smith Cloud's kinetic energy rules out models based on
ejection from the disc. We construct a dynamically self-consistent, multi-phase
model of the Galaxy with a view to exploring whether the Smith Cloud can be
understood in terms of an infalling, compact HVC that has transited the
Galactic disc. We show that while a dark-matter (DM) free HVC of sufficient
mass and density can reach the disc, it does not survive the transit. The most
important ingredient to survival during a transit is a confining DM subhalo
around the cloud; radiative gas cooling and high spatial resolution ($\lesssim$
10 pc) are also essential. In our model, the cloud develops a head-tail
morphology within ~10 Myr before and after its first disc crossing; after the
event, the tail is left behind and accretes onto the disc within ~400 Myr. In
our interpretation, the Smith Cloud corresponds to a gas 'streamer' that
detaches, falls back and fades after the DM subhalo, distorted by the disc
passage, has moved on. We conclude that subhalos with ${\rm M}_{\rm DM}
\lesssim 10^9 ~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ have accreted $\sim10^9 ~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ of
gas into the Galaxy over cosmic time - a small fraction of the total baryon
budget.

The final sample contains 132 G&C, 22111 field galaxies and 2225 G&C galaxies
with r-band magnitude <20. Of the G&C, 95% have at least three spectroscopic

the help of the functional renormalisation group. In an expansion about flat
backgrounds, explicit results for beta functions, fixed points, universal

exploiting running propagators, vertices, and background couplings. Invariably,
we find that the gauge coupling becomes asymptotically free while the
gravitational sector becomes asymptotically safe. The dependence on matter
field multiplicities is weak. We also explain how the scheme dependence, which
is more pronounced, can be handled without changing the physics. Our findings
offer a new interpretation of many earlier results, which is explained in

(sub)millimeter wavelengths is currently uncertain. Classically, polarization
is expected from non-spherical grains aligned with the magnetic field.
Recently, two alternatives have been suggested. One polarization mechanism is
caused by self-scattering from dust grains of sizes comparable to the
wavelength while the other mechanism is due to grains aligned with their short
axes along the direction of radiation anisotropy. The latter has recently been
shown as a likely mechanism for causing the dust polarization detected in HL
Tau at 3.1 mm. In this paper, we present ALMA polarization observations of HL
Tau for two more wavelengths: 870 $\mu$m and 1.3 mm. The morphology at 870
$\mu$m matches the expectation for self-scattering, while that at 1.3 mm shows
a mix between self-scattering and grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy.
The observations cast doubt on the ability of (sub)millimeter continuum
polarization to probe disk magnetic fields for at least HL Tau. By showing two
distinct polarization morphologies at 870 $\mu$m and 3.1 mm and a transition
between the two at 1.3 mm, this paper provides definitive evidence that the
dominant (sub)millimeter polarization mechanism transitions with wavelength. In
addition, if the polarization at 870 $\mu$m is due to scattering, the lack of
polarization asymmetry along the minor axis of the inclined disk implies that
the large grains responsible for the scattering have already settled into a
geometrically thin layer, and the presence of asymmetry along the major axis
indicates that the HL Tau disk is not completely axisymmetric.

external field that linearly affects their energy splitting. Following the
frequency estimation approach in which one optimizes the state and sensing time
of the probes to maximize the sensitivity, we provide a systematic study of the
attainable precision under the impact of noise originating from independent
bosonic baths. We invoke an explicit microscopic derivation of the probe
dynamics using the spin-boson model with weak coupling of arbitrary geometry
and clarify how the secular approximation leads to a phase-covariant dynamics,
where the noise terms commute with the field Hamiltonian, while the inclusion
of non-secular terms breaks the phase-covariance. Moreover, unless one
restricts to a particular (i.e., Ohmic) spectral density of the bath modes, the
noise terms may contain relevant information about the frequency to be
estimated. Thus, by considering general evolutions of a single probe, we study
regimes in which these two effects have a non-negligible impact on the
achievable precision. We then consider baths of Ohmic spectral density yet
fully accounting for the lack of phase-covariance, in order to characterize the
ultimate attainable scaling of precision when $N$ probes are used in parallel.
Crucially, we show that beyond the semigroup (Lindbladian) regime the Zeno
limit imposing the $1/N^{3/2}$ scaling of the mean squared error, derived
assuming phase-covariance, generalises to any dynamics of the probes, unless
the latter are coupled to the baths in the direction perfectly transversal to
the encoding---when a novel scaling of $1/N^{7/4}$ arises. As our microscopic
approach covers all classes of dissipative dynamics, from semigroup to
non-Markovian ones (potentially non-phase-covariant), it provides an exhaustive
picture, in which all the different asymptotic scalings of precision naturally
emerge.

predominantly comprised of random alignments of unassociated stars with similar

However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data makes it very important
to have an efficient analysis pipeline in place for the identification of
disease so that effective crop management decisions can be made. The focus of
this work is to determine the minimal number of most effective hyperspectral
bands that can distinguish between healthy and diseased specimens early in the
growing season. Healthy and diseased hyperspectral data cubes were captured at
3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after inoculation. We utilized inoculated and control
specimens from 4 different genotypes. Each hyperspectral image was captured at
240 different wavelengths in the range of 383 to 1032 nm. We used a combination
of genetic algorithm as an optimizer and support vector machines as a
classifier for identification of maximally effective band combinations. A
binary classification between healthy and infected samples using six selected
band combinations obtained a classification accuracy of 97% and a F1 score of
0.97 for the infected class. The results demonstrated that these carefully
chosen bands are more informative than RGB images, and could be used in a
multispectral camera for remote identification of charcoal rot infection in
soybean.

largely determines the rate of evolution at the later stages of a star's life.
The dust-driven outflows from AGB stars are particularly important in this
regard. Including AGB dust formation in a stellar evolution model does also
require a model of these outflows. Since AGB stars exhibit large-amplitude
pulsation, a model based on time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) is
needed in order to capture all the important physical aspects of dust
formation. However, this cannot be afforded in a stellar evolution model. Here,
a mean-flow model is presented, which include corrections to the steady-state

question-and-answer (Q&A) sites depends mainly on the will of their members to
answer others' questions. In fact, when formulating requests on Q&A sites, we
are not simply seeking for information. Instead, we are also asking for other
people's help and feedback. Understanding the dynamics of the participation in
Q&A communities is essential to improve the value of crowdsourced knowledge.
  Objective: In this paper, we investigate how information seekers can increase
the chance of eliciting a successful answer to their questions on Stack
Overflow by focusing on the following actionable factors: affect, presentation
quality, and time.
  Method: We develop a conceptual framework of factors potentially influencing
the success of questions in Stack Overflow. We quantitatively analyze a set of
over 87K questions from the official Stack Overflow dump to assess the impact
of actionable factors on the success of technical requests. The information
seeker reputation is included as a control factor. Furthermore, to understand
the role played by affective states in the success of questions, we
qualitatively analyze questions containing positive and negative emotions.
Finally, a survey is conducted to understand how Stack Overflow users perceive
the guideline suggestions for writing questions.
  Results: We found that regardless of user reputation, successful questions
are short, contain code snippets, and do not abuse with uppercase characters.
As regards affect, successful questions adopt a neutral emotional style.
  Conclusion: We provide evidence-based guidelines for writing effective
questions on Stack Overflow that software engineers can follow to increase the
chance of getting technical help. As for the role of affect, we empirically
confirmed community guidelines that suggest avoiding rudeness in question
writing.

constitute all of the dark matter, providing a novel scenario of structure
formation, with early reionization and a rapid growth of the massive black
holes at the center of galaxies and dark matter halos. The scenario arises from
broad peaks in the primordial power spectrum that give both a spatially
clustered and an extended mass distribution of PBH. The constraints from the
observed microlensing events on the extended mass function have already been
addressed. Here we study the impact of spatial clustering on the microlensing
constraints. We find that the bounds can be relaxed significantly for
relatively broad mass distributions if the number of primordial black holes
within each cluster is typically above one hundred. On the other hand, even if
they arise from individual black holes within the cluster, the bounds from CMB
anisotropies are less stringent due to the enhanced black hole velocity in such
dense clusters. This way, the window between a few and ten solar masses has
opened up for PBH to comprise the totality of the dark matter.

infectious disease, which is spreading in a population concurrently with
awareness. The model considers contributions to the overall awareness from a
global information campaign, direct contacts between unaware and aware
individuals, and reported cases of infection. It is assumed that there is some
time delay between individuals becoming aware and modifying their behaviour.
Vaccination is administered to newborns, as well as to aware individuals, and
it is further assumed that vaccine-induced immunity may wane with time.
Feasibility and stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria are
studied analytically, and conditions for the Hopf bifurcation of the endemic
steady state are found in terms of system parameters and the time delay.
Analytical results are supported by numerical continuation of the Hopf
bifurcation and numerical simulations of the model to illustrate different
types of dynamical behaviour.

combined with higher order ballooning theory, a new analytical approach is
developed to reconstruct the global linear mode structure with associated
global mode frequency. In addition to the isolated mode (IM), which usually
peaks on the outboard mid-plane, the higher order ballooning theory has also
captured other types of less unstable global modes: (a) the weakly asymmetric
ballooning theory (WABT) predicts a mixed mode (MM) that undergoes a small
poloidal shift away from the outboard mid-plane, (b) a relatively more stable
general mode (GM) balloons on the top (or bottom) of the tokamak plasma. In
this paper, an analytic approach is developed to combine these disconnected
analytical limits into a single generalised ballooning theory (GBT). This is
used to investigate how an IM behaves under the effect of sheared toroidal
flow. For small values of flow an IM initially converts into a MM where the
results of WABT are recaptured, and eventually, as the flow increases, the mode
asymptotically becomes a GM on the top (or bottom) of the plasma. This may be
an ingredient in models for understanding why in some experimental scenarios,
instead of large edge localised modes (ELMs), small ELMs are observed. Finally,
our theory can have other important consequences, especially for calculations
involving Reynolds stress driven intrinsic rotation through the radial
asymmetry in the global mode structures. Understanding the intrinsic rotation
is significant because external torque in a plasma the size of ITER is expected
to be relatively low.

However, in many settings the non-differentiable convex function $f(\cdot)$ is
not uniformly Lipschitz continuous -- for example (i) the classical support
vector machine (SVM) problem, (ii) the problem of minimizing the maximum of
convex quadratic functions, and even (iii) the univariate setting with $f(x) :=

use two working regression models: one for predicting the missing covariates

neighbor imputing set. This set is then used to nonparametrically impute
covariate values for the missing observation. Upon the completion of
imputation, Cox regression is performed on the multiply imputed datasets to
estimate the regression coefficients. In a simulation study, we compare the
nonparametric multiple imputation approach with the augmented inverse
probability weighted (AIPW) method, which directly incorporates the two working
models into estimation of Cox regression. We show that all approaches can
reduce bias due to non-ignorable missing mechanism. The proposed nonparametric
imputation method is robust to mis-specification of either one of the two
working models and robust to mis-specification of the link function of the two
working models. In contrast, the AIPW method is not robust to mis-specification

optimization methods are by now routinely used in data mining. However, this
progress is not yet matched by equal progress on automatic analyses that yield
information beyond performance-optimizing hyperparameter settings. In this
work, we aim to answer the following two questions: Given an algorithm, what
are generally its most important hyperparameters, and what are typically good
values for these? We present methodology and a framework to answer these
questions based on meta-learning across many datasets. We apply this
methodology using the experimental meta-data available on OpenML to determine
the most important hyperparameters of support vector machines, random forests
and Adaboost, and to infer priors for all their hyperparameters. The results,
obtained fully automatically, provide a quantitative basis to focus efforts in
both manual algorithm design and in automated hyperparameter optimization. The
conducted experiments confirm that the hyperparameters selected by the proposed
method are indeed the most important ones and that the obtained priors also
lead to statistically significant improvements in hyperparameter optimization.

is one of the major science drivers of nuclear physics. A comprehensive
understanding of these systems goes beyond the traditional configuration
interactions approach formulated in the Hilbert space of localized states
(nuclear shell model) and requires an open quantum system description. The
complex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM) provides such a framework as it is
capable of describing resonant and non-resonant many-body states on equal
footing.
  To make reliable predictions, quality input is needed that allows for the
full uncertainty quantification of theoretical results. In this study, we carry
out the optimization of an effective GSM (one-body and two-body) interaction in
the $psdf$ shell model space. The resulting interaction is expected to describe
nuclei with $5 \leqslant A \leqslant 12$ at the $p-sd$-shell interface.
  The optimized one-body potential reproduces nucleon-$^4$He scattering phase
shifts up to an excitation energy of 20 MeV. The two-body interaction built on
top of the optimized one-body field is adjusted to the bound and unbound
ground-state binding energies and selected excited states of the Helium,
Lithium, and Beryllium isotopes up to $A=9$. A very good agreement with
experiment was obtained for binding energies. First applications of the
optimized interaction include predictions for two-nucleon correlation densities
and excitation spectra of light nuclei with quantified uncertainties.
  The new interaction will enable comprehensive and fully quantified studies of
structure and reactions aspects of nuclei from the $psd$ region of the nuclear
chart.

scalar dark matter, especially axions, throughout the universe. When the local
gravitational interactions between the scalar modes are sufficiently rapid, it
can cause the field to re-organize into a BEC of gravitationally bound clumps.
While these clumps are stable when only gravitation is included, the picture is
complicated by the presence of the axion's attractive self-interactions, which
can potentially cause the clumps to collapse. Here we perform a detailed
stability analysis to determine under what conditions the clumps are stable. In
this paper we focus on spherical configurations, leaving aspherical
configurations for future work. We identify branches of clump solutions of the
axion-gravity-self-interacting system and study their stability properties. We
find that clumps that are (spatially) large are stable, while clumps that are
(spatially) small are unstable and may collapse. Furthermore, there is a
maximum number of particles that can be in a clump. We map out the full space
of solutions, which includes quasi-stable axitons, and clarify how a recent
claim in the literature of a new ultra-dense branch of stable solutions rests
on an invalid use of the non-relativistic approximation. We also consider
repulsive self-interactions that may arise from a generic scalar dark matter
candidate, finding a single stable branch that extends to arbitrary particle
number.

coupling to a background flat $G$ gauge field furnishes a purely topological
response theory. The response action evaluated on certain manifolds, with
appropriate choice of background gauge field, defines a set of SPT topological

of flat $G$ gauge fields to obtain Dijkgraaf-Witten topological $G$ gauge
theories. These topological gauge theories can be ungauged by first introducing
and then proliferating defects that spoils the gauge symmetry. This mechanism
is related to anyon condensation in $2+1d$ and condensing bosonic gauge charges
in $3+1d$. In the dual boundary approach, we study $1+1d$ and $2+1d$ quantum
field theories that have $G$ 't-Hooft anomalies that can be precisely cancelled

construct/compute topological invariants for the bulk SPTs directly from the

different background gauge fields to construct $G$-characters that generate
topological data for the bulk topological gauge theory. Finally, we study a
$2+1d$ quantum field theory with a mixed $\mathbb{Z}_2^{T/R} \times U(1)$
anomaly where $\mathbb{Z}_2^{T/R}$ is time-reversal/reflection symmetry, and
the $U(1)$ could be a 0-form or 1-form symmetry depending on the choice of time
reversal/reflection action. We briefly discuss the bulk effective action and
topological response for a theory in $3+1d$ that cancels this anomaly. This
signals the existence of SPTs in $3+1d$ protected by 0,1-form $U(1)\times

synapses are weight quantized to accommodate for limited conductance levels.
Pruning is based on the power law weight-dependent Spike Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) model; synapses between pre- and post-neuron with high spike
correlation are retained, whereas synapses with low correlation or uncorrelated
spiking activity are pruned. The weights of the retained connections are
quantized to the available number of conductance levels. The process of pruning
non-critical connections and quantizing the weights of critical synapses is
performed at regular intervals during training. We evaluated our sparse and

light curves from various resources and estimate the optical peak time and
optical peak magnitude in order to search for gamma-ray emission to test if all
novae are gamma-ray emitters. Methods. We repeat the analysis of the six novae
previously identified as gamma-ray sources and develop a unified analysis
strategy which we then apply to all novae in our catalog. We search for
emission in a 15-day time window in two-day steps ranging from 20 days before

Monte Carlo simulations to set constraints on the properties of the gamma-ray
emission of novae. Results. Two new novae candidates have been found at 2sigma
global significance. Although these two novae candidates were not detected at a
significant level individually, taking them together with the other
non-detected novae, we found a sub-threshold nova population with a cumulative
3sigma significance. We report the measured gamma-ray flux for detected sources

backers, and platform providers to keep the trust between the creators and the
backers, and the trust between the platform providers and users. According to
Kickstarter, 35% backers did not receive rewards on time. Unfortunately, little
is known about on-time and late reward delivery projects, and there is no prior
work to estimate reward delivery duration. To fill the gap, in this paper, we
(i) extract novel features that reveal latent difficulty levels of project
rewards; (ii) build predictive models to identify whether a creator will
deliver all rewards in a project on time or not; and (iii) build a regression
model to estimate accurate reward delivery duration (i.e., how long it will
take to produce and deliver all the rewards). Experimental results show that
our models achieve good performance -- 82.5% accuracy, 78.1 RMSE, and 0.108
NRMSE at the first 5% of the longest reward delivery duration.

examining trajectories where finite space-time regions are conditioned to be

and require a careful analysis to detect and mitigate risks in a timely manner.
Analyzing safety incidents using operational data and producing event-based
explanations is invaluable to airline companies as well as to governing
organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United
States. However, this task is challenging because of the complexity involved in
mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous time series data, the lack of
time-step-wise annotation of events in a flight, and the lack of scalable tools
to perform analysis over a large number of events. In this work, we propose a
precursor mining algorithm that identifies events in the multidimensional time

systems health and safety monitoring and in explaining and forecasting safety
incidents. Current methods suffer from poor scalability to high dimensional
time series data and are inefficient in capturing temporal behavior. We propose
an approach by combining multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent

a joint decoder can reconstruct the sources within a prescribed mean squared
error distortion based on the compressed data. The optimal rate-distortion
performance of this system was previously known only for the two extreme cases

Somewhat surprisingly, it is established in the present paper that the optimal

theory, on third harmonic generation (THG) and four-wave mixing (FWM) in
graphene that has its chemical potential tuned by ion-gel gating. THG was seen
to have enhanced by ~30 times when pristine graphene was heavily doped, while
difference-frequency FWM appeared just the opposite. The latter was found to
have a strong divergence toward degenerate FWM in undoped graphene, leading to
a giant third-order nonlinearity. These truly amazing characteristics of
graphene come from the possibility to gate-control the chemical potential,
which selectively switches on and off one- and multi-photon resonant
transitions that coherently contribute to the optical nonlinearity, and
therefore can be utilized to develop graphene-based nonlinear optoelectronic
devices.

energy and is essential for improving the performance of spintronics-based
devices. While the damping of ferromagnets has been well studied and can be
artificially controlled in practice, the damping parameters of
antiferromagnetic materials are nevertheless little known for their physical
mechanisms or numerical values. Here we calculate the damping parameters in
antiferromagnetic dynamics using the generalized scattering theory of
magnetization dissipation combined with the first-principles transport
computation. For the PtMn, IrMn, PdMn and FeMn metallic antiferromagnets, the
damping coefficient associated with the motion of magnetization ($\alpha_m$) is
one to three orders of magnitude larger than the other damping coefficient
associated with the variation of the N\'eel order ($\alpha_n$), in sharp
contrast to the assumptions made in the literature.

$A_n(V)$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, first introduced by Dong, Li, and Mason in
1998. We resolve some issues that arise in a few theorems previously presented
when these algebras were first introduced, and give examples illustrating the
need for certain modifications of the statements of those theorems. We
establish that whether or not $A_{n-1}(V)$ is isomorphic to a direct summand of
$A_n(V)$ affects the types of indecomposable $V$-modules which can be
constructed by inducing from an $A_n(V)$-module, and in particular whether
there are $V$-modules induced from $A_n(V)$-modules that were not already
induced by $A_0(V)$. We give some characterizations of the $V$-modules that can
be constructed from such inducings, in particular as regards their singular
vectors. To illustrate these results, we discuss two examples of $A_1(V)$: when
$V$ is the vertex operator algebra associated to either the Heisenberg algebra
or the Virasoro algebra. For these two examples, we show how the structure of
$A_1(V)$ in relationship to $A_0(V)$ determines what types of indecomposable
$V$-modules can be induced from a module for the level zero versus level one
Zhu algebras. We construct a family of indecomposable modules for the Virasoro
vertex operator algebra that are logarithmic modules and are not highest weight
modules.

economic and pricing theory for resource management in the evolving fifth
generation (5G) wireless networks. The 5G wireless networks are envisioned to
overcome existing limitations of cellular networks in terms of data rate,
capacity, latency, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, coverage,
reliability, and cost per information transfer. To achieve the goals, the 5G
systems will adopt emerging technologies such as massive Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO), mmWave communications, and dense Heterogeneous Networks
(HetNets). However, 5G involves multiple entities and stakeholders that may
have different objectives, e.g., high data rate, low latency, utility
maximization, and revenue/profit maximization. This poses a number of
challenges to resource management designs of 5G. While the traditional
solutions may neither efficient nor applicable, economic and pricing models
have been recently developed and adopted as useful tools to achieve the
objectives. In this paper, we review economic and pricing approaches proposed
to address resource management issues in the 5G wireless networks including
user association, spectrum allocation, and interference and power management.
Furthermore, we present applications of economic and pricing models for
wireless caching and mobile data offloading. Finally, we highlight important
challenges, open issues and future research directions of applying economic and

parallelized easily. Despite promising empirical performances, most of these
methods are derived from heuristic considerations and therefore still lack
theoretical justification. To address this issue, we study in this paper a
simple edge sampling scheme that uses network local information. We show that
when local connectivity is sufficiently strong, the sampled network satisfies a
strong spectral property. We quantify the strength of local connectivity by a
global parameter and relate it to more common network statistics such as the

Resnets both analytically and empirically. We formalize the notion of iterative
refinement in Resnets by showing that residual connections naturally encourage
features of residual blocks to move along the negative gradient of loss as we
go from one block to the next. In addition, our empirical analysis suggests
that Resnets are able to perform both representation learning and iterative
refinement. In general, a Resnet block tends to concentrate representation
learning behavior in the first few layers while higher layers perform iterative
refinement of features. Finally we observe that sharing residual layers naively
leads to representation explosion and counterintuitively, overfitting, and we
show that simple existing strategies can help alleviating this problem.

spectral efficiency with respect to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) for
low-latency downlink transmission, thus making it attractive for the emerging
Internet of Things. We consider a two-user downlink NOMA system with finite
blocklength constraints, in which the transmission rates and power allocation
are optimized. To this end, we investigate the trade-off among the transmission
rate, decoding error probability, and the transmission latency measured in
blocklength. Then, a one-dimensional search algorithm is proposed to resolve
the challenges mainly due to the achievable rate affected by the finite
blocklength and the unguaranteed successive interference cancellation. We also
analyze the performance of OMA as a benchmark to fully demonstrate the benefit
of NOMA. Our simulation results show that NOMA significantly outperforms OMA in
terms of achieving a higher effective throughput subject to the same finite
blocklength constraint, or incurring a lower latency to achieve the same
effective throughput target. Interestingly, we further find that with the
finite blocklength, the advantage of NOMA relative to OMA is more prominent
when the effective throughput targets at the two users become more comparable.

exchange line emission from galaxy clusters would not only impact the
interpretation of the newly-discovered 3.5 keV line, but also open up a new
research topic on the interaction between hot and cold matter in clusters. We
aim to perform the most systematic search for the O VIII charge exchange line
in cluster spectra using the RGS on board XMM. We introduce a sample of 21
clusters observed with the RGS. The dominating thermal plasma emission is
modeled and subtracted with a two-temperature CIE component, and the residuals
are stacked for the line search. The systematic uncertainties in the fits are
quantified by refitting the spectra with a varying continuum and line
broadening. By the residual stacking, we do find a hint of a line-like feature
at 14.82 A, the characteristic wavelength expected for oxygen charge exchange.
This feature has a marginal significance of 2.8 sigma, and the average
equivalent width is 2.5E-4 keV. We further demonstrate that the putative
feature can be hardly affected by the systematic errors from continuum
modelling and instrumental effects, or the atomic uncertainties of the
neighbouring thermal lines. Assuming a realistic temperature and abundance
pattern, the physical model implied by the possible oxygen line agrees well
with the theoretical model proposed previously to explain the reported 3.5 keV
line. If the charge exchange source indeed exists, we would expect that the
oxygen abundance is potentially overestimated by 8-22% in previous X-ray
measurements which assumed pure thermal lines.

emission with 32'' FWHM resolution from a ~ 10 pc$^{2}$ portion of the
Cepheus-L1251 molecular cloud to identify hierarchical dense gas structures.
Our dendrogram analysis of the NH$_3$ data results in 22 top-level structures,
which reside within 13 lower-level, parent structures. The structures are
compact (0.01 pc $\lesssim R_{eff} \lesssim$ 0.1 pc) and are spatially
correlated with the highest H$_2$ column density portions of the cloud. We also
compare the ammonia data to a catalog of dense cores identified by
higher-resolution (18.2'' FWHM) Herschel Space Observatory observations of dust
continuum emission from Cepheus-L1251. Maps of kinetic gas temperature,
velocity dispersion, and NH$_3$ column density, derived from detailed modeling
of the NH$_3$ data, are used to investigate the stability and chemistry of the
ammonia-identified and Herschel-identified structures. We show that the dust
and dense gas in the structures have similar temperatures, with median
$T_{dust}$ and $T_K$ measurements of 11.7 $\pm$ 1.1 K and 10.3 $\pm$ 2.0 K,
respectively. Based on a virial analysis, we find that the ammonia-identified
structures are gravitationally dominated, yet may be in or near a state of
virial equilibrium. Meanwhile, the majority of the Herschel-identified dense
cores appear to be not bound by their own gravity and instead confined by
external pressure. CCS $(2_0-1_0)$ and HC$_5$N $(9-8)$ emission from the region
reveal broader line widths and centroid velocity offsets when compared to the
NH$_3$ (1,1) emission in some cases, likely due to these carbon-based molecules
tracing the turbulent outer layers of the dense cores.

ranges from several $\mathrm{meV}$ to tens of $\mathrm{meV}$ and can be
effectively tuned by the external fields. The electron-hole asymmetric term
splits the peak of the plasmon excitation into double peaks. The fate and

to accelerate: (1) the adaptive cubic regularization methods with exact/inexact
Hessian matrices, and (2) the adaptive gradient method, without any knowledge
of the Lipschitz constants for the gradient or the Hessian. This is achieved by
tuning the parameters used in the algorithm $\textit{adaptively}$ in its
process of progression, which can be viewed as a relaxation over the existing
algorithms in the literature. Under the assumption that the sub-problems can be
solved approximately, we establish overall iteration complexity bounds for
three newly proposed algorithms to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximate solution.
Specifically, we show that the adaptive cubic regularization methods with the
exact/inexact Hessian matrix both achieve an iteration complexity in the order
of $O\left( 1 / \epsilon^{1/3} \right)$, which matches that of the original
accelerated cubic regularization method presented in
[Nesterov-2008-Accelerating] assuming the availability of the exact Hessian
information and the Lipschitz constants, and that the sub-problems are solved
to optimality. Under the same two-phase adaptive acceleration framework, the
gradient method achieves an iteration complexity in the order $O\left( 1 /
\epsilon^{1/2} \right)$, which is known to be best possible (cf.
Nesterov-2013-Introductory). Our numerical experiment results show a clear
effect of acceleration displayed in the adaptive Newton method with cubic
regularization on a set of regularized logistic regression instances.

shown that the wave packet undergoes a transient $zitterbewegung$ (ZB). Various

i.e. for $0<\alpha<1$ the resulting ZB consists of two distinct frequencies

packet exhibits single frequency ZB for $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=1$. It is also
unveiled that the frequency of ZB corresponding to $\alpha=1$ gets exactly half
of that corresponding to the $\alpha=0$ case. On the other hand, when the
initial wave packet was in $hub$ site, the ZB consists of only one frequency
for all values of $\alpha$. Using stationary phase approximation we find
analytical expression of velocity average which can be used to extract the
associated timescale over which the transient nature of ZB persists. On the
contrary the wave packet undergoes permanent ZB in presence of a transverse
magnetic field. Due to the presence of large number of Landau energy levels the
oscillations in ZB appear to be much more complicated. The oscillation pattern
depends significantly on the initial pseudospin polarization of the wave
packet. Furthermore, it is revealed that the number of the frequency components
involved in ZB depends on the parameter $\alpha$.

The ferroelectric materials in the organic spin valves provide a knob to vary

Yet in nanostructures and condensed matter systems, dissipation strongly

lineshape is preserved as long as we allow a rescaling of the parameters, and
an additional Lorentzian contribution that reflects the destruction of the
interference by dephasings. We discuss the pertinence of each approach -

often suffer from a lack of interpretability -- they are particularly difficult
to understand because of their non-linear nature. As a result, neural networks
are often treated as ""black box"" models, and in the past, have been trained
purely to optimize the accuracy of predictions. In this work, we create a novel
network architecture for deep learning that naturally explains its own
reasoning for each prediction. This architecture contains an autoencoder and a
special prototype layer, where each unit of that layer stores a weight vector
that resembles an encoded training input. The encoder of the autoencoder allows
us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to
visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an
accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least
one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at
least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the
autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of
the classification process. Since the prototypes are learned during training,
the learned network naturally comes with explanations for each prediction, and
the explanations are loyal to what the network actually computes.

their generative modeling nature and powerful data representation ability. In
this paper, we review different structures of deep directed generative models

focus on a specific structure that consists of layers of Bayesian Networks due
to the property of capturing inherent and rich dependencies among latent
variables. The major difficulty of learning and inference with deep directed
models with many latent variables is the intractable inference due to the
dependencies among the latent variables and the exponential number of latent
variable configurations. Current solutions use variational methods often
through an auxiliary network to approximate the posterior probability
inference. In contrast, inference can also be performed directly without using
any auxiliary network to maximally preserve the dependencies among the latent
variables. Specifically, by exploiting the sparse representation with the
latent space, max-max instead of max-sum operation can be used to overcome the
exponential number of latent configurations. Furthermore, the max-max operation
and augmented coordinate ascent are applied to both supervised and unsupervised
learning as well as to various inference. Quantitative evaluations on benchmark
datasets of different models are given for both data representation and feature

The corresponding inference problems are challenging since the normalization
constant (partition function) of the Ising/Potts distributions cannot be
computed efficiently on large instances. Different ways to address this issue
have hence given size to a substantial methodological literature. In this paper
we investigate how these methods could be used on much larger datasets than
studied previously. We focus on a central aspect, that in practice these
inference problems are almost always severely under-sampled, and the
operational result is almost always a small set of leading (largest)
predictions. We therefore explore an approach where the data is pre-filtered
based on empirical correlations, which can be computed directly even for very
large problems. Inference is only used on the much smaller instance in a
subsequent step of the analysis. We show that in several relevant model classes
such a combined approach gives results of almost the same quality as the
computationally much more demanding inference on the whole dataset. We also
show that results on whole-genome epistatic couplings that were obtained in a
recent computation-intensive study can be retrieved by the new approach. The

supervised scene text detection method (WeText) that trains robust and accurate
scene text detection models by learning from unannotated or weakly annotated
data. With a ""light"" supervised model trained on a small fully annotated
dataset, we explore semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning on a large
unannotated dataset and a large weakly annotated dataset, respectively. For the
unsupervised learning, the light supervised model is applied to the unannotated
dataset to search for more character training samples, which are further
combined with the small annotated dataset to retrain a superior character
detection model. For the weakly supervised learning, the character searching is
guided by high-level annotations of words/text lines that are widely available
and also much easier to prepare. In addition, we design an unified scene
character detector by adapting regression based deep networks, which greatly
relieves the error accumulation issue that widely exists in most traditional
approaches. Extensive experiments across different unannotated and weakly

clearly boosted under both scenarios, where the weakly supervised learning can
achieve the state-of-the-art performance by using only 229 fully annotated

satellite images by extending the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
(cGANs) from RGB images to multispectral images. Satellite images have been
widely utilized for various purposes, such as natural environment monitoring
(pollution, forest or rivers), transportation improvement and prompt emergency
response to disasters. However, the obscurity caused by clouds makes it
unstable to monitor the situation on the ground with the visible light camera.
Images captured by a longer wavelength are introduced to reduce the effects of
clouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is such an example that improves
visibility even the clouds exist. On the other hand, the spatial resolution
decreases as the wavelength increases. Furthermore, the images captured by long
wavelengths differs considerably from those captured by visible light in terms
of their appearance. Therefore, we propose a network that can remove clouds and
generate visible light images from the multispectral images taken as inputs.
This is achieved by extending the input channels of cGANs to be compatible with
multispectral images. The networks are trained to output images that are close
to the ground truth using the images synthesized with clouds over the ground
truth as inputs. In the available dataset, the proportion of images of the
forest or the sea is very high, which will introduce bias in the training
dataset if uniformly sampled from the original dataset. Thus, we utilize the
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to improve the problem of
bias in the training dataset. Finally, we confirm the feasibility of the
proposed network on the dataset of four bands images, which include three
visible light bands and one near-infrared (NIR) band.

computation that have proven highly effective. Still, ANNs lack a natural
notion of time, and neural units in ANNs exchange analog values in a
frame-based manner, a computationally and energetically inefficient form of
communication. This contrasts sharply with biological neurons that communicate
sparingly and efficiently using binary spikes. While artificial Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) can be constructed by replacing the units of an ANN with
spiking neurons, the current performance is far from that of deep ANNs on hard
benchmarks and these SNNs use much higher firing rates compared to their
biological counterparts, limiting their efficiency. Here we show how spiking
neurons that employ an efficient form of neural coding can be used to construct
SNNs that match high-performance ANNs and exceed state-of-the-art in SNNs on
important benchmarks, while requiring much lower average firing rates. For
this, we use spike-time coding based on the firing rate limiting adaptation
phenomenon observed in biological spiking neurons. This phenomenon can be
captured in adapting spiking neuron models, for which we derive the effective
transfer function. Neural units in ANNs trained with this transfer function can
be substituted directly with adaptive spiking neurons, and the resulting
Adaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) can carry out inference in deep neural networks using up
to an order of magnitude fewer spikes compared to previous SNNs. Adaptive
spike-time coding additionally allows for the dynamic control of neural coding
precision: we show how a simple model of arousal in AdSNNs further halves the
average required firing rate and this notion naturally extends to other forms
of attention. AdSNNs thus hold promise as a novel and efficient model for
neural computation that naturally fits to temporally continuous and
asynchronous applications.

notoriously difficult since it is a strong non-equilibrium effect. Here we show
that the concept of the potential energy landscape (PEL), developed for the

coarse graining of the extended PEL for sheared systems, one can distinguish
two fundamentally different types of plastic events, namely inherent structures
(IS) vs. minimized structure (MS) transitions. We apply these concepts to
non-cyclic and cyclic shearing of small systems, which allow us to characterize
the properties of elementary plastic events. Whereas the general properties of
the stress-strain curves are similar to larger systems, a closer analysis
reveals significantly different properties. This allows one to identify the
impact of the elastic coupling in larger systems. The concept of MS enables us
to relate the stress overshoot of a single trajectory to the emergence of an MS
transition. Furthermore, the occurrence of limit cycles can be characterized in
great detail for the small systems and connections to the properties of the PEL
can be formulated. Possible implications of our small-system results for the
macroscopic limit are discussed.

fields from a recently proposed time-causal spatio-temporal scale-space
framework as primitives for video analysis. We propose a new family of video
descriptors based on regional statistics of spatio-temporal receptive field
responses and evaluate this approach on the problem of dynamic texture
recognition. Our approach generalises a previously used method, based on joint
histograms of receptive field responses, from the spatial to the
spatio-temporal domain and from object recognition to dynamic texture
recognition. The time-recursive formulation enables computationally efficient
time-causal recognition. The experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art. Especially, it is shown that binary
versions of our dynamic texture descriptors achieve improved performance
compared to a large range of similar methods using different primitives either
handcrafted or learned from data. Further, our qualitative and quantitative
investigation into parameter choices and the use of different sets of receptive
fields highlights the robustness and flexibility of our approach. Together,
these results support the descriptive power of this family of time-causal
spatio-temporal receptive fields, validate our approach for dynamic texture
recognition and point towards the possibility of designing a range of video
analysis methods based on these new time-causal spatio-temporal primitives.

malicious traffic on computer networks. Snort and Suricata were installed on
two different but identical computers and the performance was evaluated at 10
Gbps network speed. It was noted that Suricata could process a higher speed of
network traffic than Snort with lower packet drop rate but it consumed higher
computational resources. Snort had higher detection accuracy and was thus
selected for further experiments. It was observed that the Snort triggered a
high rate of false positive alarms. To solve this problem a Snort adaptive
plug-in was developed. To select the best performing algorithm for Snort
adaptive plug-in, an empirical study was carried out with different learning
algorithms and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected. A hybrid version of
SVM and Fuzzy logic produced a better detection accuracy. But the best result
was achieved using an optimised SVM with firefly algorithm with FPR (false
positive rate) as 8.6% and FNR (false negative rate) as 2.2%, which is a good
result. The novelty of this work is the performance comparison of two IDSs at

energy (DE) models, including the $\Lambda$HDE, HDE, NADE and RDE model, by
using various diagnostic tools. The first diagnostic tool is the Statefinder
hierarchy, in which the evolution of Statefinder hierarchy parmeter
$S^{(1)}_3(z)$ and $S^{(1)}_4(z)$ are studied. The second is composite null
diagnostic (CND), in which the trajectories of $\{S^{(1)}_3, \epsilon\}$ and
$\{S^{(1)}_4, \epsilon\}$ are investigated, where $\epsilon$ is the fractional
growth parameter. The last is $w-w'$ analysis, where $w$ is the equation of
state for DE and the prime denotes derivative with respect to $ln a$. In the
analysis we consider two cases: varying current fractional DE density
$\Omega_{de0}$ and varying DE model parameter $C$. We find that: (1) Both the
Statefinder hierarchy and the CND have qualitative impact on $\Lambda$HDE, but
only have quantitative impact on HDE. (2) $S_4^{(1)}$ can lead to larger
differences than $S_3^{(1)}$, while the CND pair has a stronger ability to
distinguish different models than the Statefinder hierarchy. (3) For the case
of varying $C$, the $\{w, w'\}$ pair has qualitative impact on $\Lambda$HDE;
for the case of varying $\Omega_{de0}$, the $\{w, w'\}$ pair only has
quantitative impact; these results are different from the cases of HDE, RDE and
NADE, in which the $\{w, w'\}$ pair only has quantitative impact on these
models. In conclusion, compared with HDE, RDE and NADE, the $\Lambda$HDE model
can be easily distinguished by using these diagnostic tools.

are developed for using published calculations to determine the non-LTE

from the Li I 6707.8 {\AA} line. The {\Delta\}NLTE values is determined from
the following five parameters: {\Delta\}NLTE the effective temperature Teff,
the acceleration of gravity logg, the metallicity index [Fe/H], the
microturbulent velocity Vt, and the LTE Li abundance log {\epsilon}(Li). The
program is used to calculate values of {\Delta\}NLTE and the non-LTE Li
abundance for 91 single bright giants from the list of Lebre, et al. By
combining these results with data for 55 stars, we obtain the non-LTE values of
log {\epsilon}(Li) for 146 FGK-giants and supergiants. We confirm that, in the
spectra of most of these stars, it is only possible to estimate for them an
upper limit for the Li abundance. A large spread is confirmed in log
{\epsilon}(Li) for stars with masses M<6Msun. A comparison of these results
with model calculations of stars confirms the unique sensitivity of the lithium
abundance to the initial rotation velocity V0. We discuss the giants and
supergiants with lithium abundances log {\epsilon}(Li) = 1.4 +- 0.3, which
could have a rotation velocity V0=0 km/s and have already undergone deep
convective mixing. Li-rich giants with lithium abundances log {\epsilon}(Li)>2
and nearly up to the initial value of log {\epsilon}(Li) = 3.2 +- 0.1 are
examined. It is shown that the fraction of Li-rich giants with V0 = 0 - 50 km/s
is consistent with current evolutionary models. The other stars of this type,
as well as all of the ""super Li-rich"" giants, for which the standard theory is

If one imposes Dirichlet boundary condition on the top boundary and Navier

there always exists a plane Couette flow which is exponentially stable for
nonnegative $\alpha$ and any positive viscosity $\mu$ and any $a, b \in

processing and control in cyber-physical Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems with
new applications and connectivity requirements. In this context, scarce
spectrum resources must accommodate a high traffic volume with stringent
requirements of low latency, high reliability and energy efficiency.
Conventional centralized network architectures may not be able to fulfill these
requirements due to congestion in backhaul links. This article presents a novel
design of a robust dynamic edge network architecture (RDNA) for IoT which
leverages the latest advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act
as access points, storing and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest
unused resources and mitigate network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may
compromise the availability of terminal access points and channels and, thus,
network connectivity. The proposed design embraces solutions at physical,
access, networking, application, and business layers to improve network
robustness. The high density of mobile devices provides alternatives for close
connectivity which reduces interference and latency, and thus, increases
reliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing capabilities of
mobile devices project smartness onto the edge which is desirable for
autonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to
illustrate the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture
in the context of IoT are outlined. Finally, some challenges for future
research are presented.

structures given through the combinatorics of valence irreducible
representations (IRREPs) at a few high-symmetry points (HSPs) at a fixed
filling. We decompose the total topology of nodal valence band bundles through
the local topology of elementary (i.e. inseparable) nodal structures and the
global topology that constrains distinct elementary nodal elements over the
Brillouin zone (BZ). Generalizing from the cases of simple point nodes and
simple nodal lines (NLs), we argue that the local topology of every elementary
nodal structure is characterized by a set of poloidal-toroidal charges, one
monopole, and one thread charge (when threading the BZ torus), while the global
topology only allows pairs of nontrivial monopole and thread charges. We show
that all these charges are given in terms of symmetry protected topological
invariants, defined through quantized Wilson loop phases over symmetry
constrained momentum loops, which we derive entirely algebraically from the
valence IRREPs at the HSPs. In particular, we find highly connected line-nodal
structures, line-nodal monopole pairs, and line-nodal thread pairs, that are
all protected by the unitary crystalline symmetries only. Furthermore, we show
symmetry preserving topological Lifshitz transitions through which independent
NLs can be connected, disconnected, or linked. Our work constitutes a heuristic
approach to the systematic topological classification and characterization of
all momentum space line-nodal structures protected by space group symmetries in

researchers and practical applications. This is due to their unique features

networks the weights and biases of hidden nodes determining the nonlinear
feature mapping are set randomly and are not learned. Appropriate selection of
the intervals from which weights and biases are selected is extremely
important. This topic has not yet been sufficiently explored in the literature.
In this work a method of generating random weights and biases is proposed. This
method generates the parameters of the hidden nodes in such a way that
nonlinear fragments of the activation functions are located in the input space
regions with data and can be used to construct the surface approximating a
nonlinear target function. The weights and biases are dependent on the input
data range and activation function type. The proposed methods allows us to
control the generalization degree of the model. These all lead to improvement
in approximation performance of the network. Several experiments show very

several technological applications. In the presence of light atoms in
adsorbates, nuclear quantum effects (NQE) influence properties of these
systems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQE on the dissociation of
water wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations with van der Waals corrected density functional theory, we
note that several competing minima for both intact and dissociated structures
are accessible at finite temperatures, making it important to assess whether
harmonic estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the
relative stability of the different states. We perform ab initio path integral
molecular dynamics (PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into
account conformational entropy and anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We
propose that when when adsorption is weak and NQE on the substrate are
negligible, PIMD simulations can be performed through a simple partition of the
system, resulting in considerable computational savings. We calculate the
contribution of NQE to the free energies, including anharmonic terms. We find
that they result in an increase of up to 20% of the quantum contribution to the
dissociation free energy compared to harmonic estimates. We also find that the
dissociation has a negligible contribution from tunneling, but is dominated by
ZPE, which can enhance the rate by three orders of magnitude. Finally we
highlight how both temperature and NQE indirectly impact dipoles and the
redistribution of electron density, causing work function to changes of up to
0.4 eV with respect to static estimates. This quantitative determination of the
change in work function provides a possible approach to determine
experimentally the most stable configurations of water oligomers on the stepped

have further found that viscosity strongly modifies the effect of flows on the
(1,1) mode both in the linear and nonlinear regime. Axial flows increase the
linear growth rate for low viscosity values, but they decrease the linear
growth rate for higher viscosity values. In the case of poloidal flows the
linear growth rate decreases in all cases. Additionally at higher viscosity, we
have found strong symmetry breaking in the behaviour of linear growth rates and
in the nonlinear saturation levels of the modes as a function of the helicities

that in the training data. Many algorithms and user interfaces have been
designed to optimize and facilitate this human--machine interaction; however,
fewer studies have addressed the potential defects the designs can cause.
Effective interaction often requires exposing the user to the training data or
its statistics. The design of the system is then critical, as this can lead to
double use of data and overfitting, if the user reinforces noisy patterns in
the data. We propose a user modelling methodology, by assuming simple rational
behaviour, to correct the problem. We show, in a user study with 48
participants, that the method improves predictive performance in a sparse
linear regression sentiment analysis task, where graded user knowledge on
feature relevance is elicited. We believe that the key idea of inferring user
knowledge with probabilistic user models has general applicability in guarding
against overfitting and improving interactive machine learning.

fermionic in nature. These CF-type conditions play a decisive role in providing
the absolute anticommutativity of the (anti-)BRST transformations and also

of data is produced at the edge of the network. Due to a lack of computing
power, this data is currently send to the cloud where centralized machine
learning models are trained to derive higher level knowledge. With the recent
development of specialized machine learning hardware for mobile devices, a new
era of distributed learning is about to begin that raises a new research
question: How can we search in distributed machine learning models? Machine
learning at the edge of the network has many benefits, such as low-latency
inference and increased privacy. Such distributed machine learning models can
also learn personalized for a human user, a specific context, or application
scenario. As training data stays on the devices, control over possibly
sensitive data is preserved as it is not shared with a third party. This new
form of distributed learning leads to the partitioning of knowledge between
many devices which makes access difficult. In this paper we tackle the problem
of finding specific knowledge by forwarding a search request (query) to a
device that can answer it best. To that end, we use a entropy based quality
metric that takes the context of a query and the learning quality of a device
into account. We show that our forwarding strategy can achieve over 95%
accuracy in a urban mobility scenario where we use data from 30 000 people

that describe the continuous random perceptron in the thermodynamic limit, in a
very general setting with arbitrary noise and friction kernels, not necessarily
related by equilibrium relations. We derive the equations in two ways: via a
dynamical cavity method, and via a path-integral approach in its supersymmetric
formulation. The end point of both approaches is the reduction of the dynamics
of the system to an effective stochastic process for a representative dynamical
variable. Because the perceptron is formally very close to a system of
interacting particles in a high dimensional space, the methods we develop here
can be transferred to the study of liquid and glasses in high dimensions.
Potentially interesting applications are thus the study of the glass transition
in active matter, the study of the dynamics around the jamming transition, and
the calculation of rheological properties in driven systems.

where objects of differing brightness are incorrectly assumed to be detections

the inclusion of information about the sources' magnitudes. The method
described here uses the additional photometric information from both catalogues
in the process of accepting or rejecting counterparts, providing approximately
a factor 10 improvement in Bayes' factor with its inclusion. When folding in
the photometric information we avoid using prior astrophysical knowledge.
Additionally, the method allows for the possibility of no counterparts to
sources as well as the possibility that sources overlap multiple potential
counterparts. We formally describe the probability of two sources being the
same astrometric object, allowing systematic effects of astrometric
perturbation (by, e.g., contaminant objects) to be accounted for. We apply the
method to two cases. First, we test IPHAS-Gaia matches to compare the resulting
matches in two catalogues of similar wavelength coverage but differing
dynamical ranges. Second, we apply the method to matches between IPHAS and
2MASS and show that the method holds when considering two catalogues with
approximately equal astrometric precision. We discuss the importance of
including the magnitude information in each case. Additionally, we discuss
extending the method to multiple catalogue matches through an iterative
matching process. The method allows for the selection of high-quality matches
by providing an overall probability for each pairing, giving the flexibility to
choose stars known to be good matches.

light curve. In this work, we have performed a systematic and detailed
post-processing study of the impact of weak reactions on the distribution of
the electron fraction and of the entropy on the dynamic ejecta obtained from an
equal mass neutron star binary merger simulated in full general relativity and
with microscopic equation of state. Previous investigations indicated that
shocks increase Ye, however our results show that shocks can also decrease Ye,
depending on their thermodynamical conditions. Moreover, we have found that
neutrino absorption are key and need to be considered in future simulations. We
also demonstrated that the angular dependence of the neutrino luminosity and
the spatial distribution of the ejecta can lead to significant difference in
the electron fraction distribution. In addition to the detailed study of the Ye

They clearly point to the necessity of improving the neutrino treatment in

  to The IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics. 24 pages",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria are described by the self-consistent solutions of
the time-independent Maxwell equations for the real-space dynamics of
electromagnetic fields, and the Vlasov equation for the phase-space dynamics of
particle distributions in a collisionless plasma. These two systems
(macroscopic and microscopic) are coupled via the source terms in Maxwell's
equations, which are sums of velocity-space 'moment' integrals of the particle
distribution function. This paper considers 'the inverse problem for
collisionless equilibria' (IPCE), viz. ""given information regarding the
real-space/macroscopic configuration of a specific collisionless plasma
equilibrium, what self-consistent equilibrium distributions exist?"" We develop
the constants of motion approach to IPCE using the assumptions of a 'modified
Maxwellian' distribution function, and a strictly neutral and spatially
one-dimensional plasma. In such circumstances, IPCE formally reduces to the
inversion of Weierstrass transformations (Bilodeau, 1962), such as those
transformations that feature in the initial value problem for the
heat/diffusion equation. We discuss the various mathematical conditions that a
candidate solution of IPCE must satisfy. One method that can be used to invert
the Weierstrass transform is expansions in Hermite polynomials. Building on the
results of Allanson et al. (2016), we establish under what circumstances a
solution obtained by these means converges, and allows velocity moments of all
orders. Ever since the seminal work by Bernstein et al. (1957), on 'stationary'
electrostatic plasma waves, the necessary quality of non-negativity has been
noted as a feature that any candidate solution of IPCE will not $\textit{a
priori}$ satisfy. We also discuss this problem in the context of for our
formalism, for magnetised plasmas.

dense pedestrian flows through a bottleneck, notably with respect to the time
gaps between successive passages. We pinpoint the mechanisms at the origin of
these features thanks to simple models that we develop and analyse
quantitatively. We disprove the idea that anticorrelations between successive
time gaps (i.e., an alternation between shorter ones and longer ones) are a
hallmark of a zipper-like intercalation of pedestrian lines and show that they
simply result from the possibility that pedestrians from distinct 'lines' or
directions cross the bottleneck within a short time interval. A second feature
concerns the bursts of escapes, i.e., egresses that come in fast succession.
Despite the ubiquity of exponential distributions of burst sizes, entailed by a
Poisson process, we argue that anomalous (power-law) statistics arise if the
bottleneck is nearly congested, albeit only in a tiny portion of parameter
space. The generality of the proposed mechanisms implies that similar
statistical features should also be observed for other types of particulate
flows.

the transformation have been identified and its martensitic nature is now
widely recognised [5-8]. More specifically, the relevance of a nucleation and
growth model to describe the transformation is widely accepted. Recent fracture
episodes [9] of zirconia hip joint heads were reported, failures related to the
t-m transformation degradation. Among the materials solutions considered for
decreasing the sensitivity to t-m phase transformation, the possibility of
adding silica as a dopant appears as an appealing one. Previous studies have
revealed the beneficial effect of silica addition by the formation of a glassy
phase at the grain boundaries and triple points. This glassy phase has been
proven to reduce the residual stresses level [10], slowing down the
transformation kinetics. Preliminary quantitative investigations by XRD have
shown these materials are less susceptible to transformation. However, the
mechanism by which the transformation propagated has still to be assessed.

scale invariant part of the distribution has two asymptotic regimes: (1) $|V_R|
\ll R$ where the distribution depends solely on $R$; and (2) $|V_R| \gg R$
where the distribution is a function of $|V_R|$ alone. The probability
distributions in these two regimes are matched along a straight line $|V_R| =
z^\ast R$. Our simulations confirm that this is indeed correct. We further

Standard tools for machine learning, such as classification and regression, are

sensitive attributes of data does not solve this problem because a
\textit{disparate impact} can arise when non-sensitive attributes and sensitive

that avoids such a disparate impact when making a decision. Inspired by the
two-stage least squares method that is widely used in the field of economics,
we propose a two-stage algorithm that removes bias in the training data. The
proposed algorithm is conceptually simple. Unlike most of existing fair
algorithms that are designed for classification tasks, the proposed method is
able to (i) deal with regression tasks, (ii) combine explanatory attributes to
remove reverse discrimination, and (iii) deal with numerical sensitive
attributes. The performance and fairness of the proposed algorithm are

reasoning often rely on the presence of stochasticity. The majority of these
models assumes that each neuron in the functional network is equipped with its
own private source of randomness, often in the form of uncorrelated external
noise. However, both in vivo and in silico, the number of noise sources is
limited due to space and bandwidth constraints. Hence, neurons in large
networks usually need to share noise sources. Here, we show that the resulting
shared-noise correlations can significantly impair the performance of
stochastic network models. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by
using deterministic recurrent neural networks as sources of uncorrelated noise,
exploiting the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback. Consequently, even
a single recurrent network of a few hundred neurons can serve as a natural
noise source for large ensembles of functional networks, each comprising
thousands of units. We successfully apply the proposed framework to a diverse
set of binary-unit networks with different dimensionalities and entropies, as
well as to a network reproducing handwritten digits with distinct predefined
frequencies. Finally, we show that the same design transfers to functional
networks of spiking neurons.

  Springer's Empirical Software Engineering journal",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nearly every popular programming language comes with one or more package
managers. The software packages distributed by such package managers form large
software ecosystems. These packaging ecosystems contain a large number of
package releases that are updated regularly and that have many dependencies to
other package releases. While packaging ecosystems are extremely useful for
their respective communities of developers, they face challenges related to
their scale, complexity, and rate of evolution. Typical problems are backward
incompatible package updates, and the risk of (transitively) depending on
packages that have become obsolete or inactive. This manuscript uses the
libraries.io dataset to carry out a quantitative empirical analysis of the
similarities and differences between the evolution of package dependency
networks for seven packaging ecosystems of varying sizes and ages: Cargo for
Rust, CPAN for Perl, CRAN for R, npm for JavaScript, NuGet for the .NET
platform, Packagist for PHP, and RubyGems for Ruby. We propose novel metrics to
capture the growth, changeability, resuability and fragility of these
dependency networks, and use these metrics to analyse and compare their
evolution. We observe that the dependency networks tend to grow over time, both
in size and in number of package updates, while a minority of packages are
responsible for most of the package updates. The majority of packages depend on
other packages, but only a small proportion of packages accounts for most of
the reverse dependencies. We observe a high proportion of fragile packages due
to a high and increasing number of transitive dependencies. These findings are
instrumental for assessing the quality of a package dependency network, and
improving it through dependency management tools and imposed policies.

milliKelvin (mK) level temperature stability for small-scale astronomical

available components. The primary application for our ECS is the high-precision
Doppler spectrometer MINERVA-Red, where the thermal variations of the optical
components within the instrument represent a major source of systematic error.
We demonstrate $\pm 2$ mK temperature stability within a 0.5 m$^{3}$ Thermal
Enclosure using resistive heaters in conjunction with a commercially available
PID controller and off-the-shelf thermal sensors. The enclosure is maintained
above ambient temperature, enabling rapid cooling through heat dissipation into
the surrounding environment. We demonstrate peak-to-valley (PV) temperature
stability of better than 5 mK within the MINERVA-Red vacuum chamber, which is
located inside the Thermal Enclosure, despite large temperature swings in the
ambient laboratory environment. During periods of stable laboratory conditions,
the PV variations within the vacuum chamber are less than 3 mK. This
temperature stability is comparable to the best stability demonstrated for
Doppler spectrometers currently achieving 1 m s$^{-1}$ radial velocity
precision. We discuss the challenges of using commercially available
thermoelectrically cooled CCD cameras in a temperature-stabilized environment,
and demonstrate that the effects of variable heat output from the CCD camera
body can be mitigated using PID-controlled chilled water systems. The ECS
presented here could potentially provide the stable operating environment
required for future compact, ""astro-photonic"" precise radial velocity (PRV)
spectrometers to achieve high Doppler measurement precision with a modest

(KATRIN) to keV-scale sterile neutrinos, which are promising dark matter
candidates. Since the active-sterile mixing would lead to a second component in
the tritium $\beta$-spectrum with a weak relative intensity of order
$\sin^2\theta \lesssim 1\times10^{-6}$, additional experimental strategies are
required to extract this small signature and to eliminate systematics. A
possible strategy is to run the experiment in an alternative time-of-flight
(TOF) mode, yielding differential TOF spectra in contrast to the integrating
standard mode. In order to estimate the sensitivity from a reduced sample size,
a new analysis method, called self-consistent approximate Monte Carlo (SCAMC),
has been developed. The simulations show that an ideal TOF mode would be able
to achieve a statistical sensitivity of $\sin^2\theta \sim 5\times10^{-9}$ at
one $\sigma$, improving the standard mode by approximately a factor two. This
relative benefit grows significantly if additional exemplary systematics are
considered. A possible implementation of the TOF mode with existing hardware,
called gated filtering, is investigated, which, however, comes at the price of
a reduced average signal rate.

excess below 1-2 keV on top of the extrapolated high- energy power law. The
origin of this component is uncertain. It could be a signature of
relativistically blurred, ionized reflection, or the high-energy tail of
thermal Comptonization in a warm (kT $\sim$ 1 keV), optically thick
($\tau\simeq$ 10-20) corona producing the optical/UV to soft X-ray emission.
The purpose of the present paper is to test the warm corona model on a
statistically significant sample of unabsorbed, radio-quiet AGN with XMM-newton
archival data, providing simultaneous optical/UV and X-ray coverage. The sample
has 22 objects and 100 observations. We use two thermal comptonization
components to fit the broad-band spectra, one for the warm corona emission and
one for the high-energy continuum. In the optical-UV, we also include the
reddening, the small blue bump and the Galactic extinction. In the X-rays, we
include a WA and a neutral reflection. The model gives a good fit (reduced
$\chi^2 <1.5$) to more than 90% of the sample. We find the temperature of the
warm corona to be uniformly distributed in the 0.1-1 keV range, while the
optical depth is in the range $\sim$10-40. These values are consistent with a
warm corona covering a large fraction of a quasi-passive accretion disc, i.e.
that mostly reprocesses the warm corona emission. The disk intrinsic emission
represents no more than 20% of the disk total emission. According to this
interpretation, most of the accretion power would be released in the upper
layers of the accretion flow.

extensive numerical simulations for a range of processes which indicate that
the methodology correctly distinguishes different complex dynamics and
outperforms state of the art metrics in several cases. Subsequently, we apply
this methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines

differences between the statistics of local maxima and local minima in time

photometric calibration method that provides precise and consistent results
when applied to historical SHG. The proposed method is based on the assumption
that the centre-to-limb variation of the intensity in quiet Sun regions does
not vary with time. We tested the accuracy of the proposed method on various
sets of synthetic images that mimic problems encountered in historical
observations. We also tested our approach on a large sample of images randomly
extracted from seven different SHG archives. The tests carried out on the
synthetic data show that the maximum relative errors of the method are
generally <6.5%, while the average error is <1%, even if rather poor quality
observations are considered. In the absence of strong artefacts the method
returns images that differ from the ideal ones by <2% in any pixel. The method
gives consistent values for both plage and network areas. We also show that our
method returns consistent results for images from different SHG archives. Our
tests show that the proposed method is more accurate than other methods
presented in the literature. Our method can also be applied to process images
from photographic archives of solar observations at other wavelengths than Ca

is found in many physical systems that can therefore be efficiently described
by the ensuing effective representation of the density matrix $\rho(t)$. Our
probabilistic knowledge about the outcome of measurements on a quantum system
at time $t$ is not only governed by $\rho(t)$ conditioned on the evolution and
measurement outcomes obtained until time $t$, but is also modified by any
information acquired after $t$. It was shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 160401

We show here that the restriction of the dynamics of $\rho(t)$ to Gaussian
states implies that the matrix $E(t)$ is also fully characterized by a vector

explicitly depend on the Gram matrix of the analysis operator and therefore
particularly account for its mutual coherence structure. Our findings defy
conventional wisdom which promotes the sparsity of analysis coefficients as the

in many situations of practical interest, for instance, when applying a
redundant (multilevel) frame as analysis prior. By extensive numerical
experiments, we demonstrate that, in contrast, our theoretical sampling-rate
bounds reliably capture the recovery capability of various examples, such as
redundant wavelets systems, total variation, or random frames. The proofs of
our main results build upon recent achievements in the convex geometry of data
mining problems. More precisely, we establish a sophisticated upper bound on
the conic Gaussian mean width that is associated with the underlying

introduced models, that propose neutron stars (NSs) as the central engines of
ULXs, we revisit the (XMM-Newton and NuSTAR) spectra of eighteen well known
ULXs, in search of indications that favor this new hypothesis. Results: We
confirm the, previously noted, presence of the low energy (<6 keV) spectral
rollover and argue that it could be interpreted as thermal emission. The
spectra are well described by a double thermal model consisting of a ""hot"" (>1
keV) and a ""cool"" (<0.7 keV) multicolor black body (MCB). Under the assumption
that the ""cool"" MCD emission originates in a disk truncated at the NS
magnetosphere, we find that all ULXs in our sample are consistent with
accretion onto a highly magnetized (B>10^12G) NS. We note a strong correlation
between the strength of the magnetic field, the temperature of the ""hot""
thermal component and the total unabsorbed luminosity. Examination of the
NuSTAR data supported this interpretation and confirmed the presence of a weak,
high energy (>15 keV) tail, most likely the result of modification of the MCB
emission by inverse Compton scattering. We also note that the apparent high
energy tail, may simply be the result of mis-modeling of MCB emission with an
atypical temperature (T) vs radius (r) gradient, using a standard MCD model
with a fixed gradient of T~r^-0.75. Conclusions: We have offered a new physical
interpretation for the dual-thermal spectra of ULXs. We find that the best-fit
derived parameters, are in excellent agreement with recent predictions that
favor super-critically accreting NSs as the engines of a large fraction of
ULXs. Nevertheless, the considerable degeneracy between models and the lack of
unequivocal evidence cannot rule out other equally plausible interpretations.
Our results warrant further exploration of this new framework.

estimating local 3D shape properties in point clouds. In contrast to the
majority of prior techniques that concentrate on global or mid-level
attributes, e.g., for shape classification or semantic labeling, we suggest a
patch-based learning method, in which a series of local patches at multiple
scales around each point is encoded in a structured manner. Our approach is
especially well-adapted for estimating local shape properties such as normals
(both unoriented and oriented) and curvature from raw point clouds in the
presence of strong noise and multi-scale features. Our main contributions
include both a novel multi-scale variant of the recently proposed PointNet
architecture with emphasis on local shape information, and a series of novel
applications in which we demonstrate how learning from training data arising
from well-structured triangle meshes, and applying the trained model to noisy
point clouds can produce superior results compared to specialized
state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our
approach in the context of shape reconstruction, by showing how it can be used
to extract normal orientation information from point clouds.

perturbatively to one-loop, the relevant two-point and three-point Green's

the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge

argued that pulsars could be strangeon stars. What if binary strangeon stars
merge? This kind of merger could result in the formation of a hyper-massive
strangeon star, accompanied by bursts of gravitational waves and
electromagnetic radiation (and even strangeon kilonova explained in the paper).
The tidal polarizability of binary strangeon stars is different from that of
binary neutron stars, because a strangeon star is self-bound on surface by
fundamental strong force while a neutron star by the gravity, and their
equations of state are different. Our calculation shows that the tidal
polarizability of merging binary strangeon stars is favored by GW170817. Three
kinds of kilonovae (i.e., of neutron, quark and strangeon) are discussed, and
the light curve of the kilonova AT 2017gfo following GW170817 could be
explained by considering the decaying strangeon nuggets and remnant star
spin-down. Additionally, the energy ejected to the fireball around the nascent
remnant strangeon star, being manifested as a Gamma-ray burst (GRB), is
calculated. It is found that, after a promote burst, an X-ray plateau could
follow in a timescale of $10^{2-3}$ s. Certainly, the results could be tested
also by further observational synergies between gravitational wave detectors

verify. In this paper, we advance the research by presenting some verifiable
conditions for the required equi-continuity, namely some growth conditions of
the expected utility functions of each player at equilibria. In the case when
the growth is of second order, we demonstrate that the condition is guaranteed
by strong concavity of the utility function. Moreover, by using recent research
on polynomial decision rules and optimal discretization approaches in
stochastic and robust optimization, we propose some approximation schemes for
the Bayesian equilibrium problem: first, by restricting the behavioral
functions to polynomial functions of certain order over the space of types, we
demonstrate that solving a Bayesian polynomial behavioural function equilibrium
is down to solving a finite dimensional stochastic equilibrium problem; second,
we apply the optimal quantization method due to Pflug and Pichler [18] to
develop an effective discretization scheme for solving the latter. Error bounds
are derived for the respective approximation schemes under moderate conditions
and both aca- demic examples and numerical results are presented to explain the

has been given to fundamental questions concerning their utility. In this paper
we derive analytic expressions for Bayes factors given complete observation
through time, which suggest practical guidelines for model choice problems. We
extend the power posterior method for computing Bayes factors so as to account
for missing data and apply this approach to partially observed epidemics. For
comparison, we also explore the use of a deviance information criterion for
missing data scenarios. The methods are illustrated via examples involving both
simulated and real data.

each step, the walker moves to a positive neighbour that is randomly selected
and its previously visited node together with its negative neighbours are
removed. We explored both analytically and numerically how signed network
topological features influence the key performance of a SAP walk: the evolution
of the pruned network resulted from the node removals, the length of a SAP walk

models are further verified in two real-world signed networks. Our findings may
inspire the design of recommender systems regarding how recommendations and

refers to the capability of a wireless node to successfully receive packets

We consider a network of $N$ saturated sources that transmit packets to a
common destination node with the cooperation of two infinite capacity relay
nodes. The relays assist the sources by forwarding the packets that failed to
reach the destination. Moreover, the relays have also packets of their own to
transmit to the destination. We further assume that the relays employ a

accordingly adapts its transmission probability based on the status of the
other relay. Such a protocol is towards self-aware networks and leads to
substantial performance gains in terms of delay. We investigate the stability

fundamental driver of the space weather. The interaction of the multiple CMEs
in interplanetary space affects their dynamic evolution and geo-effectiveness.
The complex and merged multiple magnetic clouds appear as the in-situ signature
of the interacting CMEs. The Alfven waves are speculated to be one of the major
possible energy exchange/dissipation mechanism during the interaction. However,
no such observational evidence has been found in the literature. The case
studies of CME-CME collision events suggest that the magnetic and thermal
energy of the CME is converted into the kinetic energy. Moreover, the magnetic
reconnection process is justified to be responsible for the merging of multiple
magnetic clouds. Here, we present unambiguous evidence of sunward torsional
Alfven waves in the interacting region after the super-elastic collision of
multiple CMEs. The Walen relation is used to confirm the presence of Alfven
waves in the interacting region of multiple CMEs/magnetic clouds. We conclude
that Alfven waves and magnetic reconnection are the possible energy
exchange/dissipation mechanisms during large-scale magnetic clouds collisions.
The present study has significant implications not only in CME-magnetosphere
interactions but also in the interstellar medium where interactions of
large-scale magnetic clouds are possible.

is proposed and a novel multiresolution element method is hence presented. The
MRA framework is formulated out of a displacement subspace sequence whose basis
functions are built out of scaling and shifting on the element domain of basic
full node shape function. The basic full node shape function is constructed by
means of extending the shape function triangle domain for a split node at the
zero coordinates to the hexagon area enclosing the zero coordinates. As a
result, a new split-full node notion is presented and a novel rational MRA
concept together with the resolution level (RL) is constituted for the element.
Via practical examples, it is found that the traditional triangular plate
element and method is a mono-resolution one and also a special case of the
proposed element and method. The meshing for the monoresolution plate element
model is based on the empiricism while the RL adjusting for the multiresolution
is laid on the rigorous mathematical basis. The analysis clarity of a plate
structure is actually determined by the RL, not by the mesh. Thus, the accuracy
of a structural analysis is replaced by the clarity, the irrational MRA by the
rational and the mesh model by the RL that is the discretized model by the
integrated. The continuous full node shape function unveils secrets behind
assembling artificially of node-related items in global matrix formation by the
conventional FEM.

solvent-free model for simulating lipid bilayer membranes. In order to be used
in concert with particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations, the model is
purely based on interacting and reacting particles, each representing a coarse
patch of a lipid monolayer. Particle interactions include nearest-neighbor
bond-stretching and angle-bending, and are parameterized so as to reproduce the
local membrane mechanics given by the Helfrich energy density over a range of
relevant curvatures. In-plane fluidity is implemented with Monte Carlo
bond-flipping moves. The physical accuracy of the model is verified by five
tests: (i) Power spectrum analysis of equilibrium thermal undulations is used
to verify that the particle-based representation correctly captures the
dynamics predicted by the continuum model of fluid membranes. (ii) It is
verified that the input bending stiffness, against which the potential
parameters are optimized, is accurately recovered. (iii) Isothermal area
compressibility modulus of the membrane is calculated and is shown to be
tunable to reproduce available values for different lipid bilayers, independent
of the bending rigidity. (iv) Simulation of two-dimensional shear flow under a
gravity force is employed to measure the effective in-plane viscosity of the
membrane model, and show the possibility of modeling membranes with specified
viscosities. (v) Interaction of the bilayer membrane with a spherical
nanoparticle is modeled as a test case for large membrane deformations and
budding involved in cellular processes such as endocytosis...

compressible turbulence. The theory is formulated under the rigorous framework
of rational continuum mechanics. A set of linear constitutive equations and
balance laws are deduced and presented from the Coleman-Noll procedure and
Onsager's reciprocal relations. The governing equations are then arranged in
conservation form and solved through the finite volume method with a second
order Lax-Friedrichs scheme for shock preservation. A numerical example of
transonic flow over a three-dimensional bump is presented using MCT and the
finite volume method. The comparison shows that MCT-based DNS provides a better
prediction than NS-based DNS with less than 10% of the mesh number when
compared with experiments. A MCT-based and frame-indifferent Q-criterion is
also derived to show the coherent eddy structure of the downstream turbulence
in the numerical example. It should be emphasized that unlike the NS-based
G-criterion, the MCT-based Q-criterion is objective without the limitation of
Galilean-invariance.

  second-order model of traffic flow","26 pages",,,,"math.NA physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lane changing is one of the most common maneuvers on motorways. Although,
macroscopic traffic models are well known for their suitability to describe
fast moving crowded traffic, most of these models are generally developed in
one dimensional framework, henceforth lane changing behavior is somehow
neglected. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic model, which accounts for
lane-changing behavior on motorway, based on a two-dimensional extension of the
Aw and Rascle [Aw and Rascle, SIAM J.Appl.Math., 2000] and Zhang [Zhang,
Transport.Res.B-Meth., 2002] macroscopic model for traffic flow. Under
conditions, when lane changing maneuvers are no longer possible, the model
""relaxes"" to the one-dimensional Aw-Rascle-Zhang model. Following the same
approach as in [Aw, Klar, Materne and Rascle, SIAM J.Appl.Math., 2002], we
derive the two-dimensional macroscopic model through scaling of time
discretization of a microscopic follow-the-leader model with driving direction.
We provide a detailed analysis of the space-time discretization of the proposed
macroscopic as well as an approximation of the solution to the associated
Riemann problem. Furthermore, we illustrate some features of the proposed model
through some numerical experiments.

is possible. In this study, quantum communication does not mean quantum
teleportation or quantum cryptography, but transmission of information itself.
Because of consistency with special relativity, the possibility of the quantum
communication leads to another conclusion that the collapse of the wave
function must propagate at the speed of light or slower.
  We show this requirement is consistent with nonlocality in quantum mechanics.
We also demonstrate that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment does not

promising tool for polyatomic gas flows, especially for fluid flows containing
inner structures, such as turbulence, polyatomic gas flows and others. Although
a Hamiltonian-based distribution function was proposed for diatomic gas flow, a
general distribution function for the generalized Boltzmann-Curtiss equations
and polyatomic gas flow is still out of reach. With assistance from Boltzmann's
entropy principle, a generalized Boltzmann-Curtiss distribution for polyatomic
gas flow is introduced. The corresponding governing equations at equilibrium
state are derived and compared with Eringen's morphing (micropolar) continuum
theory derived under the framework of rational continuum thermomechanics.
Although rational continuum thermomechanics has the advantages of mathematical
rigor and simplicity, the presented statistical kinetic theory approach
provides a clear physical picture for what the governing equations represent.

uniform and gamma delay distributions in terms of coupling parameters and the
proportion of inactive oscillators. The results suggest that for the uniform
distribution increasing the width of distribution for the same mean delay
allows aging transition to happen for a smaller coupling strength and a smaller
proportion of inactive elements. For gamma distribution with sufficiently large
mean time delay, it may be possible to achieve aging transition for an
arbitrary proportion of inactive oscillators, as long as the coupling strength
lies in a certain range.

activity associated with conscious awareness. Can we obtain evidence for
features of the optimal brain organization that allows for adequate processing
of stimuli and that may guide the emergence of cognition and consciousness?
Analysing brain recordings in conscious and unconscious states, we followed
initially the classic approach in physics when it comes to understanding
collective behaviours of systems composed of a myriad of units: the assessment
of the number of possible configurations (microstates) that the system can
adopt, for which we use a global entropic measure associated with the number of
connected brain regions. Having found maximal entropy in conscious states, we
then inspected the microscopic nature of the configurations of connections
using an adequate complexity measure, and found higher complexity in states
characterised not only by conscious awareness but also by subconscious
cognitive processing, such as sleep stages. Our observations indicate that
conscious awareness is associated with maximal global (macroscopic) entropy and
with the short time scale (microscopic) complexity of the configurations of
connected brain networks in pathological unconscious states (seizures and
coma), but the microscopic view captures the high complexity in physiological
unconscious states (sleep) where there is information processing. As such, our
results support the global nature of conscious awareness, as advocated by
several theories of cognition. We thus hope that our studies represent
preliminary steps to reveal aspects of the structure of cognition that leads to
conscious awareness.

daring strategies that carry a high risk for him to be eliminated, and more

this game was originally formulated in 1961 by Dresher, who modeled a duel
between two opponents. The game has also been of interest in the description of
athletic competitions. We extend here the two-player game to an arbitrary
number $N$ of symmetric players. We show that there is a mixed-strategy Nash
equilibrium and find its exact analytic expression, which we analyze in
particular in the limit of large $N$, where mean-field behavior occurs. The
original game with $N=2$ arises as a singular limit of the general case.
