dynamical system $(X,f)$. In addition to chain transitivity, we define strong
chain transitivity and vague transitivity. Associated with each there is a
notion of mixing, defined by transitivity of the product system $(X \times X, f
\times f)$. These extend the concept of weak mixing which is associated with
topological transitivity. Using the barrier functions of Fathi and Pageault, we
obtain for each of these extended notions a dichotomy result that a transitive
system of each type either satisfies the corresponding mixing condition or else
factors onto an appropriate type of equicontinuous minimal system. The
classical dichotomy result for minimal systems follows when it is shown that a
minimal system is weak mixing if and only if it is vague mixing.

to personally-owned cars presents ample opportunities for achieving more
efficient transportation in cities. With private cars spending on the average
over 95\% of the time parked, one of the possible benefits of shared mobility
is the reduced need for parking space. While widely discussed, a systematic
quantification of these benefits as a function of mobility demand and sharing
models is still mostly lacking in the literature. As a first step in this
direction, this paper focuses on a type of private mobility which, although
specific, is a major contributor to traffic congestion and parking needs,
namely, home-work commuting. We develop a data-driven methodology for
estimating commuter parking needs in different shared mobility models,
including a model where self-driving vehicles are used to partially compensate
flow imbalance typical of commuting, and further reduce parking infrastructure
at the expense of increased traveled kilometers. We consider the city of
Singapore as a case study, and produce very encouraging results showing that
the gradual transition to shared mobility models will bring tangible reductions
in parking infrastructure. In the future-looking, self-driving vehicle
scenario, our analysis suggests that up to 50\% reduction in parking needs can
be achieved at the expense of increasing total traveled kilometers of less than
2\%.

for pairs of rational elliptic surfaces. We demonstrate that, when two rational
elliptic surfaces have an identical complex structure, stable degeneration
always exists. We provide an equation that systematically describes the stable
degeneration of a K3 surface into a pair of isomorphic rational elliptic
surfaces. When two rational elliptic surfaces have different complex
structures, whether their sum glued along a smooth fiber admits deformation to
a K3 surface can be determined by studying the structure of the K3 lattice. We
investigate the lattice theoretic condition to determine whether a deformation
to a K3 surface exists for pairs of extremal rational elliptic surfaces. In
addition, we discuss the configurations of singular fibers under stable
degeneration. The sum of two isomorphic rational elliptic surfaces glued
together admits a deformation to a K3 surface, the singular fibers of which are
twice that of the rational elliptic surface. For special situations, singular
fibers of the resulting K3 surface collide and they are enhanced to a fiber of
another type. Some K3 surfaces become attractive in these situations. We
determine the complex structures and the Weierstrass forms of these attractive
K3 surfaces. We also deduce the gauge groups in F-theory compactifications on
these attractive K3 surfaces times a K3. $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, $SU(5)$, and

studied by means of the field theoretic renormalization group within the
one-loop approximation. It is corroborated that regardless of the values of
model parameters and initial data, the inertial-range behavior of the model is
described by limiting case of vanishing correlation time. It indicates that the
Galilean symmetry of the model violated by the ""colored"" random force is
restored in the inertial range. This regime corresponds to the only nontrivial
fixed point of the renormalization group equation. The stability of this point
depends on the relation between the exponents in the energy spectrum ${\cal E}

analyzed problem is the passive advection of a scalar field by this velocity
ensemble. Correlation functions of the scalar field exhibit anomalous scaling
behavior in the inertial-convective range. We demonstrate that in accordance

contribution to the operator product expansion is given by the isotropic
operator, while anisotropic terms should be considered only as corrections.

purity of the channel respects a duality relation. It characterizes the allowed
values of coherence when the channel has certain purity. This duality has been
depicted via the Coherence-Purity (Co-Pu) diagrams. In particular, we study the
quantum coherence of the unital and non-unital qubit channels and find out the
allowed region of coherence for a fixed purity. We also study coherence of
different incoherent channels, namely, incoherent operation (IO), strictly
incoherent operation (SIO), physical incoherent operation (PIO) etc.
Interestingly, we find that the allowed region for different incoherent
operations maintain the relation $PIO\subset SIO \subset IO$. In fact, we find
that if PIOs are coherence preserving operations (CPO), its coherence is zero
otherwise it has unit coherence and unit purity. Interestingly, different kinds
of qubit channels can be distinguished using the Co-Pu diagram. The unital
channels generally do not create coherence whereas some nonunital can. All
coherence breaking channels are shown to have zero coherence, whereas, this is
not usually true for entanglement breaking channels. It turns out that the
coherence preserving qubit channels have unit coherence. Although the coherence
of the Choi matrix of the incoherent channels might have finite values, its
subsystem contains no coherence. This indicates that the incoherent channels
can either be unital or nonunital under some conditions.

inputs---through the lens of the sum-of-squares semidefinite programming
hierarchy (SoS). This family of powerful semidefinite programs has recently
yielded many new algorithms for planted problems, often achieving the best
known polynomial-time guarantees in terms of accuracy of recovered solutions
and robustness to noise. One theme in recent work is the design of spectral
algorithms which match the guarantees of SoS algorithms for planted problems.
Classical spectral algorithms are often unable to accomplish this: the twist in
these new spectral algorithms is the use of spectral structure of matrices
whose entries are low-degree polynomials of the input variables. We prove that
for a wide class of planted problems, including refuting random constraint
satisfaction problems, tensor and sparse PCA, densest-k-subgraph, community
detection in stochastic block models, planted clique, and others, eigenvalues
of degree-d matrix polynomials are as powerful as SoS semidefinite programs of
roughly degree d. For such problems it is therefore always possible to match
the guarantees of SoS without solving a large semidefinite program. Using
related ideas on SoS algorithms and low-degree matrix polynomials (and inspired
by recent work on SoS and the planted clique problem by Barak et al.), we prove
new nearly-tight SoS lower bounds for the tensor and sparse principal component
analysis problems. Our lower bounds for sparse principal component analysis are
the first to suggest that going beyond existing algorithms for this problem may
require sub-exponential time.

have become increasingly popular in whole genome association analysis as a
complementary approach to traditional individual variant analysis. However,
these methods test for the association between an outcome and the genetic
variants in a pre-specified region, e.g., a gene. In view of massive intergenic
regions in whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies, we propose a computationally
efficient quadratic scan (Q-SCAN) statistic based method to detect the
existence and the locations of signal regions by scanning the genome
continuously. The proposed method accounts for the correlation (linkage
disequilibrium) among genetic variants, and allows for signal regions to have
both causal and neutral variants, and the effects of signal variants to be in
different directions. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed Q-SCAN
statistics. We derive an empirical threshold that controls for the family-wise
error rate, and show that under regularity conditions the proposed method
consistently selects the true signal regions. We perform simulation studies to
evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. Our simulation
results show that the proposed procedure outperforms the existing methods,
especially when signal regions have causal variants whose effects are in
different directions, or are contaminated with neutral variants. We illustrate
Q-SCAN by analyzing the WGS data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities

NeVIII absorption in two regimes: absorption too weak to be significant in

13.7). We do not detect NeVIII absorption in either regime. Combining our

particles over millions of years, allowing them to grow beyond the radial drift
barrier. Here, we present ALMA 0.04""-resolution imaging of the pre-transitional
disk of V1247 Orionis that reveals an asymmetric ring as well as a
sharply-confined crescent structure, resembling morphologies seen in
theoretical models of vortex formation. The asymmetric ring (at 0.17""=54 au
separation from the star) and the crescent (at 0.38""=120 au) seem smoothly
connected through a one-armed spiral arm structure that has been found

orbiting at $\sim0.3$""$\approx$100 au, where the one-armed spiral arm detected

dynamical influence of the planet clears the gap between the ring and the
crescent and triggers two vortices that trap mm-sized particles, namely the
crescent and the bright asymmetry seen in the ring. We conducted dedicated

relation that allows us to rescale the detection threshold (i.e. lowest
detectable mass) for substructures to a detection threshold for line-of-sight
haloes at any redshift. We then quantify the line-of-sight contribution to the
total number density of low-mass objects that can be detected through strong
gravitational lensing. Finally, we assess the degeneracy between substructures

statistical interpretation of current and future detections, with the aim of
distinguishing between CDM and WDM. We find that line-of-sight haloes

strongly depends on the source and lens redshifts, and on the chosen dark
matter model. Substructures represent about 30 percent of the total number of
perturbers for low lens and source redshifts (as for the SLACS lenses), but
less than 10 per cent for high redshift systems. We also find that for data

sub-Chandrasekhar mass events. An important difference between these two cases
is the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess
in Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high
central density.
  From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the
chemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf
galaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity,
low-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Key diagnostic abundance ratios include
C/Fe, {\alpha}/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios, which could not have been produced
by Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, Core-Collapse Type II supernovae or
Pair-Instsability supernovae. Strong deficiencies of Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe
also suggest the absence of alpha-rich freeze-out nucleosynthesis, favoring
low-mass WD progenitor SNe Ia. Based on comparisons of the measured Mn/Fe and
Si/Fe ratios with detonation models, we estimate a WD mass near 0.95Msun. We
also compare Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios to the recent theoretical yields predicted
by Shen et al., finding consistent results. To explain the COS 171 [Fe/H], at
-1.35 dex, requires dilution of the ejecta from a single SNIa event with ~10^4
Msun of material; this is expected for a SN Ia remnant expanding into a warm
interstellar medium with n~1 /cm^3. In the future, finding more stars with the
unique chemical signatures we highlight here will be important for constraining
the rate and environments of sub-Chandrasekhar SNe Ia.

possibility of dark matter being composed of PBHs. It has been suggested that
PBHs of tens of solar masses could serve as dark matter candidates. Recent
analytical studies demonstrated that compact ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can
serve as a sensitive test for the PBH dark matter hypothesis, since stars in
such a halo-dominated system would be heated by the more massive PBHs, their
present-day distribution can provide strong constraints on PBH mass. In this
study, we further explore this scenario with more detailed calculations, using
a combination of dynamical simulations and Bayesian inference methods. The
joint evolution of stars and PBH dark matter is followed with a Fokker-Planck
code PhaseFlow. We run a large suite of such simulations for different dark
matter parameters, then use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to constrain
the PBH properties with observations of ultra-faint galaxies. We find that
two-body relaxation between the stars and PBH drives up the stellar core size,
and increases the central stellar velocity dispersion. Using the observed
half-light radius and velocity dispersion of stars in the compact ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies as joint constraints, we infer that these dwarfs may have a
cored dark matter halo with the central density in the range of 1-2
$\rm{M_{\odot}/pc^3}$, and that the PBHs may have a mass range of 2-14

formation rate (sSFR) derived from spatially-resolved SDSS-IV MaNGA

formation and determine a galaxy's location in the SFR-$\rm M_\star$ diagram.
Even within the star-forming `main sequence', the measured sSFR decreases with
stellar mass, both in an integrated and spatially-resolved sense. Flat sSFR
radial profiles are observed for $\rm log(M_\star/ M_\odot) < 10.5$, while
star-forming galaxies of higher mass show a significant decrease in sSFR in the
central regions, a likely consequence of both larger bulges and an inside-out
growth history. Our primary focus is the green valley, constituted by galaxies
lying below the star formation main sequence, but not fully passive. In the
green valley we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to
star-forming galaxies of the same mass at all galactocentric distances out to 2
effective radii. The responsible quenching mechanism therefore appears to
affect the entire galaxy, not simply an expanding central region. The majority
of green valley galaxies of $\rm log(M_\star/ M_\odot) > 10.0$ are classified
spectroscopically as central low-ionisation emission-line regions (cLIERs).
Despite displaying a higher central stellar mass concentration, the sSFR
suppression observed in cLIER galaxies is not simply due to the larger mass of
the bulge. Drawing a comparison sample of star forming galaxies with the same

topologically trivial phase with the emergence of AF long-range order. As a
concrete example, we study the phase structure of the honeycomb lattice
Kane-Mele model as a function of the inversion-breaking ionic potential and the
Hubbard interaction. We find an easy $z$-axis $C=1$ AFCI phase and a spin-flop
transition to a topologically trivial $xy$-plane collinear antiferromagnet. We
propose experimental realizations of the AFCI and QAHE in correlated electron
materials and cold atom systems.

phenomenon of Many-Body Localization (MBL), which defies thermalization due to
the formation of an extensive number of quasi local integrals of motion. The
one particle operator content of these integrals of motion is related to the
one particle orbitals of the one particle density matrix and shows a strong
signature across the MBL transition as recently pointed out by Bera et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 046603 (2015); Ann. Phys. 529, 1600356 (2017)]. We study
the properties of the one particle orbitals of many-body eigenstates of an MBL
system in one dimension. Using shift-and-invert MPS (SIMPS), a matrix product
state method to target highly excited many-body eigenstates introduced in
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 017201 (2017)], we are able to obtain accurate results
for large systems of sizes up to L = 64. We find that the one particle orbitals
drawn from eigenstates at different energy densities have high overlap and
their occupations are correlated with the energy of the eigenstates. Moreover,
the standard deviation of the inverse participation ratio of these orbitals is
maximal at the nose of the mobility edge. Also, the one particle orbitals decay
exponentially in real space, with a correlation length that increases at low
disorder. In addition, we find a 1/f distribution of the coupling constants of
a certain range of the number operators of the OPOs, which is related to their
exponential decay.

$\mu\int_{\Omega}\phi|u|^q$. The appearance of the nonlocal term makes the

although ground state solutions always exist, the existence of least energy
nodal solution depends on $q$: for $q\in(1,2)$ there does not exist a least
energy nodal solution while for $q\in[2,5)$ such a solution exists. Note that
$q=2$ is a critical value. In the case of a linear local perturbation, i.e.,
$p=2,$ if $\lambda<\lambda_1,$ the problem has a positive ground state and a
least energy nodal solution. However, if $\lambda\geq \lambda_1,$ the problem
has a ground state which changes sign. Hence it is also a least energy nodal
solution.

(PDF) of evolved large-scale matter density fluctuations. We do this by
splitting lines of sight by density based on their count of tracer galaxies,
and by measuring both gravitational shear around and counts-in-cells in
overdense and underdense lines of sight, in Dark Energy Survey (DES) First Year
and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Our analysis uses a perturbation
theory model (see companion paper Friedrich at al.) and is validated using
N-body simulation realizations and log-normal mocks. It allows us to constrain
cosmology, bias and stochasticity of galaxies w.r.t. matter density and, in
addition, the skewness of the matter density field.
  From a Bayesian model comparison, we find that the data weakly prefer a
connection of galaxies and matter that is stochastic beyond Poisson
fluctuations on <=20 arcmin angular smoothing scale. The two stochasticity
models we fit yield DES constraints on the matter density
$\Omega_m=0.26^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $\Omega_m=0.28^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ that are
consistent with each other. These values also agree with the DES analysis of
galaxy and shear two-point functions (3x2pt) that only uses second moments of
the PDF. Constraints on $\sigma_8$ are model dependent
($\sigma_8=0.97^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ and $0.80^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ for the two
stochasticity models), but consistent with each other and with the 3x2pt
results if stochasticity is at the low end of the posterior range.
  As an additional test of gravity, counts and lensing in cells allow to
compare the skewness $S_3$ of the matter density PDF to its LCDM prediction. We
find no evidence of excess skewness in any model or data set, with better than
25 per cent relative precision in the skewness estimate from DES alone.

navigation system by comparing the estimate of local, ambient flow velocity
with preloaded ocean current maps. The proposed navigation system is
implemented through a marginalized particle filter where the vehicle's states
are sequentially tracked along with sensor bias and local turbulence that is
not resolved by general flow prediction. The performance of the proposed
approach is first analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations in two artificial
background flow fields, resembling real-world ocean circulation patterns,
superposed with smaller-scale, turbulent components with Kolmogorov energy

We report on the existence of `Centrally Suppressed' galaxies, which have
suppressed SSFR in their cores compared to their disks. The profiles of
centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distibuted in a bimodal way.
Galaxies with high stellar mass and core velocity dispersion are found to be
much more likely to be centrally suppressed than low mass galaxies, and we show
that this is related to morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER like
emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at
all radii compared to unsuppressed galaxies. The profiles of central and

experience lower specific star formation rates at all radii than central

experts and nonexperts alike to use more sophisticated models, engage in faster
exploratory modeling and analysis, and ensure experimental reproducibility.
However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at
the scale of massive modern datasets, and modifications to make them so are
typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical
guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework,
this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the dataset
itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian
inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation
of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and
demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from
the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert
coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an
inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert
coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one
based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on
approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact
computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the
construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood
functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to
implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic
datasets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a
significant reduction in the computational cost of inference.

Ultra Deep field down to 30th magnitude. We compared photometric redshift
estimates from three spectral fitting codes from the literature (EAZY, BPZ and
BEAGLE) to high quality redshifts for 1227 galaxies from the MUSE integral
field spectrograph. All these codes can return photometric redshifts with bias
|Dzn|=|z-z_phot|/(1+z)<0.05 down to F775W=30 and spectroscopic incompleteness
is unlikely to strongly modify this statement. We have, however, identified
clear systematic biases in the determination of photometric redshifts: in the
0.4<z<1.5 range, photometric redshifts are systematically biased low by as much
as Dzn=-0.04 in the median, and at z>3 they are systematically biased high by
up to Dzn = 0.05, an offset that can in part be explained by adjusting the
amount of intergalactic absorption applied. In agreement with previous studies
we find little difference in the performance of the different codes, but in
contrast to those we find that adding extensive ground-based and IRAC
photometry actually can worsen photo-z performance for faint galaxies. We find
an outlier fraction, defined through |Dzn|>0.15, of 8% for BPZ and 10% for EAZY
and BEAGLE, and show explicitly that this is a strong function of magnitude.
While this outlier fraction is high relative to numbers presented in the
literature for brighter galaxies, they are very comparable to literature
results when the depth of the data is taken into account. Finally, we
demonstrate that while a redshift might be of high confidence, the association
of a spectrum to the photometric object can be very uncertain and lead to a
contamination of a few percent in spectroscopic training samples that do not
show up as catastrophic outliers, a problem that must be tackled in order to
have sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts for future cosmological
surveys.

metastable phases with positive excess formation enthalpies ({\Delta}H). In
contrast, monolayer alloys of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX2 (M =
Mo, W; X = S, Se) always have negative {\Delta}H, suggesting atomic ordering,
which is, however, not yet experimentally observed. Using first-principles
calculations, we find that the negative {\Delta}H of cation-mixed TMD alloys
results from the charge transfer from weak Mo-X to nearest strong W-X bonds and
the negative {\Delta}H of anion-mixed TMD alloys comes from the larger energy
gain due to the charge transfer from Se to nearest S atoms than the energy cost
due to the lattice mismatch. Consequently, cation-mixed and anion-mixed alloys
should energetically prefer to have Mo-X-W and S-M-Se ordering, respectively.
The atomic ordering, however, is only locally ordered but disordered in the
long range due to the symmetry of TMD monolayers, as demonstrated by many
energetically degenerate structures for given alloy compositions. Besides, the
local ordering and disordering effects on the macroscopic properties such as
bandgaps and optical absorptions are negligible, making the experimental
observation of locally ordered TMD alloys challenging. We propose to take the
advantage of microscopic properties such as defects which strongly depend on
local atomic configurations for experiments to identify the disordering and
local ordering in TMD alloys. Finally, quaternary TMD alloys by mixing both
cations and anions are studied to have a wide range of bandgaps for
optoelectronic applications. Our work is expected to help the formation and
utilization of TMD alloys.

propagate through the liquid therefore their amplitude and phase are affected

is a big challenge, whose performance and stability are determined by different
physics factors entangled with each other complicatedly. In this work, we apply
the multi-objective optimization based on the Pareto Efficiency and
Particle-Swarm Optimization methods to design new functional materials
directionally. As a demonstration, we achieve the thermoelectric design of 2D
SnSe materials through the methods. We identify several novel metastable 2D
SnSe structures with simultaneously lower free energy and better thermoelectric
performance over the experimentally-reported monolayer structures. We hope our
results about the multi-objective Pareto Optimization method can make a step
towards the integrative design of multi-objective and multi-functional

face verification, are reasonably dependent on illumination conditions which
are usually uncontrolled and unpredictable in the real world. An illumination
robust preprocessing method thus remains a significant challenge in reliable
face analysis. In this paper we propose a novel approach for improving lighting
normalization through building the underlying reflectance model which
characterizes interactions between skin surface, lighting source and camera
sensor, and elaborates the formation of face color appearance. Specifically,
the proposed illumination processing pipeline enables the generation of
Chromaticity Intrinsic Image (CII) in a log chromaticity space which is robust
to illumination variations. Moreover, as an advantage over most prevailing
methods, a photo-realistic color face image is subsequently reconstructed which
eliminates a wide variety of shadows whilst retaining the color information and
identity details. Experimental results under different scenarios and using
various face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to deal
with lighting variations, including both soft and hard shadows, in face
recognition.

Alfven wave turbulence (AWT). The Alfven waves are assumed to be launched from
a collection of kilogauss flux tubes in the photosphere at the two ends of the
loop. Using a three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model for an
active-region loop, we investigate how the waves from neighboring flux tubes
interact in the chromosphere and corona. For a particular combination of model
parameters we find that AWT can produce enough heat to maintain a peak
temperature of about 2.5 MK, somewhat lower than the temperatures of 3-4 MK
observed in the cores of active regions. The heating rates vary strongly in
space and time, but the simulated heating events have durations less than 1
minute and are unlikely to reproduce the observed broad Differential Emission
Measure distributions of active regions. The simulated spectral line
non-thermal widths are predicted to be about 27 km/s, which is high compared to
the observed values. Therefore, the present AWT model does not satisfy the
observational constraints. An alternative ""magnetic braiding"" model is
considered in which the coronal field lines are subject to slow random
footpoint motions, but we find that such long period motions produce much less
heating than the shorter period waves launched within the flux tubes. We
discuss several possibilities for resolving the problem of producing
sufficiently hot loops in active regions.

data mined from molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. The MD data is suggestive
of an irreversible densification transition in volumetric compression resulting
in permanent, or plastic, densification upon unloading. The MD data also
reveals an evolution towards a critical state of constant volume under
pressure-shear deformation. The trend towards constant volume is from above,
when the glass is overconsolidated, or from below, when it is
underconsolidated. We show that these characteristic behaviors are
well-captured by a critical state model of plasticity, where the densification
law for glass takes the place of the classical consolidation law of granular
media and the locus of constant volume states denotes the critical-state line.
A salient feature of the critical-state line of fused silica, as identified
from the MD data, that renders its yield behavior anomalous is that it is
strongly non-convex, owing to the existence of two well-differentiated phases
at low and high pressures. We argue that this strong non-convexity of yield
explains the patterning that is observed in molecular dynamics calculations of
amorphous solids deforming in shear. We employ an explicit and exact rank-2
envelope construction to upscale the microscopic critical-state model to the
macroscale. Remarkably, owing to the equilibrium constraint the resulting
effective macroscopic behavior is still characterized by a non-convex
critical-state line. Despite this lack of convexity, the effective macroscopic
model is stable against microstructure formation and defines well-posed
boundary-value problems.

distributed optimization over a cluster of machines, frequent communication and
synchronization of all model parameters (optimization variables) can be very
costly. A promising solution is to use parameter servers to store different
subsets of the model parameters, and update them asynchronously at different
machines using local datasets. In this paper, we focus on distributed
optimization of large linear models with convex loss functions, and propose a
family of randomized primal-dual block coordinate algorithms that are
especially suitable for asynchronous distributed implementation with parameter
servers. In particular, we work with the saddle-point formulation of such
problems which allows simultaneous data and model partitioning, and exploit its
structure by doubly stochastic coordinate optimization with variance reduction
(DSCOVR). Compared with other first-order distributed algorithms, we show that
DSCOVR may require less amount of overall computation and communication, and
less or no synchronization. We discuss the implementation details of the DSCOVR
algorithms, and present numerical experiments on an industrial distributed
computing system.

data from the Cluster mission's STAFF Search Coil magnetometer when the level
of turbulence is sufficiently high that the morphology of the power spectrum at
electron scales can be investigated. The Cluster spacecraft sample a disturbed
interval of plasma where two streams of solar wind interact. Meanwhile, several
discontinuities (coherent structures) are seen in the large scale magnetic
field, while at small scales several intermittent bursts of wave activity
(whistler waves) are present. Several different morphologies of the power
spectrum can be identified: (1) two power laws separated by a break (2) an
exponential cutoff near the Taylor shifted electron scales and (3) strong
spectral knees at the Taylor shifted electron scales. These different
morphologies are investigated by using wavelet coherence, showing that in this
interval a clear break and strong spectral knees are features which are
associated with sporadic quasi parallel propagating whistler waves, even for
short times. On the other hand, when no signatures of whistler waves at 0.1 -
0.2fce are present, a clear break is difficult to find and the spectrum is
often more characteristic of a power law with an exponential cutoff.

we conclude that dropout can be used as a low-rank regularizer with data

  Publishing",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the development of Big Data and cloud data sharing, privacy preserving
data publishing becomes one of the most important topics in the past decade. As
one of the most influential privacy definitions, differential privacy provides
a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data publishing. Differentially
private interactive publishing achieves good performance in many applications;
however, the curator has to release a large number of queries in a batch or a
synthetic dataset in the Big Data era. To provide accurate non-interactive
publishing results in the constraint of differential privacy, two challenges
need to be tackled: one is how to decrease the correlation between large sets
of queries, while the other is how to predict on fresh queries. Neither is easy
to solve by the traditional differential privacy mechanism. This paper
transfers the data publishing problem to a machine learning problem, in which
queries are considered as training samples and a prediction model will be
released rather than query results or synthetic datasets. When the model is
published, it can be used to answer current submitted queries and predict
results for fresh queries from the public. Compared with the traditional
method, the proposed prediction model enhances the accuracy of query results
for non-interactive publishing. Experimental results show that the proposed
solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of Mean Absolute
Value on a large group of queries. This also suggests the learning model can
successfully retain the utility of published queries while preserving privacy.

functions of the brain. To understand the underlying synaptic mechanisms, a

employs the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp.
Using theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic

to measure the conductance due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction
between the clamp current and the synaptic current. Consequently, it incurs
substantial measurement error, even giving rise to unphysically negative
conductance as observed in experiments. To elucidate synaptic impact on

knowledge-based artificial neural network dose models (ANN-DMs) to predict dose
distributions that would be approved by experienced physicians. Using dose
distributions calculated by a commercial treatment planning system (TPS),
physician-approved treatment plans were used to train ANN-DMs that could
predict physician-approved dose distributions based on a set of geometric
parameters (vary from voxel to voxel) and plan parameters (constant across all
voxels for a given patient). Differences between TPS and ANN-DM dose
distributions were used to evaluate model performance. ANN-DM design, including
neural network structure and parameter choices, were evaluated to optimize dose
model performance. Mean dose errors were less than 5% at all distances from the
PTV, and mean absolute dose errors were on the order of 5%, but no more than
10%. Dose-volume histogram errors demonstrated good model performance above 25
Gy, but much larger errors were seen at lower doses. ANN-DM dose distributions
showed excellent overall agreement with TPS dose distributions, and accuracy
was substantially improved when each physician's treatment approach was taken
into account by training their own dedicated models. In this manner, one could
feasibly train ANN-DMs that could predict the dose distribution desired by a
given physician for a given treatment site.

works mainly focus on generative problem to generate new data. We have
different goal, aim to correlate heterogeneous data, by utilizing the power of

to learn discriminative common representation for bridging heterogeneity gap.
The main contributions are: (1) Cross-modal GANs architecture is proposed to
model joint distribution over data of different modalities. The inter-modality
and intra-modality correlation can be explored simultaneously in generative and
discriminative models. Both of them beat each other to promote cross-modal
correlation learning. (2) Cross-modal convolutional autoencoders with
weight-sharing constraint are proposed to form generative model. They can not
only exploit cross-modal correlation for learning common representation, but
also preserve reconstruction information for capturing semantic consistency
within each modality. (3) Cross-modal adversarial mechanism is proposed, which
utilizes two kinds of discriminative models to simultaneously conduct
intra-modality and inter-modality discrimination. They can mutually boost to
make common representation more discriminative by adversarial training process.
To the best of our knowledge, our proposed CM-GANs approach is the first to
utilize GANs to perform cross-modal common representation learning. Experiments
are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed approach on cross-modal

detectors. The tile is produced by depositing 60 orthogonal metal
charge-collecting strips, 3~mm wide, on a 10~\si{\cm} $\times$ 10~\si{\cm}
fused-silica wafer. These charge tiles may be employed by large detectors, such
as the proposed tonne-scale nEXO experiment to search for neutrinoless
double-beta decay. Modular by design, an array of tiles can cover a sizable
area. The width of each strip is small compared to the size of the tile, so a
Frisch grid is not required. A grid-less, tiled anode design is beneficial for
an experiment such as nEXO, where a wire tensioning support structure and
Frisch grid might contribute radioactive backgrounds and would have to be
designed to accommodate cycling to cryogenic temperatures. The segmented anode
also reduces some degeneracies in signal reconstruction that arise in
large-area crossed-wire time projection chambers. A prototype tile was tested
in a cell containing liquid xenon. Very good agreement is achieved between the
measured ionization spectrum of a $^{207}$Bi source and simulations that
include the microphysics of recombination in xenon and a detailed modeling of
the electrostatic field of the detector. An energy resolution $\sigma/E$=5.5\%

regression model for noisy labels $y_i\in\mathbb{R}$. The ridge estimator is a
classical solution to this problem. However, when labels are expensive, we are
forced to select only a small subset of vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ for which we
obtain the labels $y_i$. We propose a new procedure for selecting the subset of
vectors, such that the ridge estimator obtained from that subset offers strong
statistical guarantees in terms of the mean squared prediction error over the
entire dataset of $n$ labeled vectors. The number of labels needed is
proportional to the statistical dimension of the problem which is often much
smaller than $d$. Our method is an extension of a joint subsampling procedure
called volume sampling. A second major contribution is that we speed up volume
sampling so that it is essentially as efficient as leverage scores, which is
the main i.i.d. subsampling procedure for this task. Finally, we show
theoretically and experimentally that volume sampling has a clear advantage
over any i.i.d. sampling when labels are expensive.

modern video codecs divide the input frames into macroblocks (MBs). We
demonstrate that selective access to MB motion vector (MV) information within
compressed video bitstreams can also provide for selective, motion-adaptive, MB
pixel decoding (a.k.a., MB texture decoding). This in turn allows for the
derivation of spatio-temporal video activity regions at extremely high speed in
comparison to conventional full-frame decoding followed by optical flow
estimation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of a video classification
framework based on such activity data, we independently train two CNN
architectures on MB texture and MV correspondences and then fuse their scores
to derive the final classification of each test video. Evaluation on two
standard datasets shows that the proposed approach is competitive to the best

computation. To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, it is
important to separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In
the traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the
excitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic
current-voltage (I-V) relation --- the slope corresponds to the total
conductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of
the space clamp effect, the measured conductance in general deviates
substantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the
interpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to
be clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized
ball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron
model, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the
conductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological
interpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp
current and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a
consequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of
conductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative
conductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on
neuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework
to determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional
impact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal
information processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic
neuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by
providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity
in neuronal computation.

biolabeling, and sensing due to their ability to host color centers with
remarkable photostability and long spin-coherence times at room temperature.
Recently, a bottom-up, high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) approach was
demonstrated for growing nanodiamonds with color centers from amorphous carbon
precursors in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) that was supported by
a near-hydrostatic noble gas pressure medium. However, a detailed understanding
of the photothermal heating and its effect on diamond growth, including the
phase conversion conditions and the temperature-dependence of color center
formation, has not been reported. In this work, we measure blackbody radiation
during LH-DAC synthesis of nanodiamond from carbon aerogel to examine these
temperature-dependent effects. Blackbody temperature measurements suggest that
nanodiamond growth can occur at 16.3 GPa and 1800 K. We use Mie theory and
analytical heat transport to develop a predictive photothermal heating model.
This model demonstrates that melting the noble gas pressure medium during laser
heating decreases the local thermal conductivity to drive a high spatial
resolution of phase conversion to diamond. Finally, we observe a
temperature-dependent formation of nitrogen vacancy centers and interpret this
phenomenon in the context of HPHT carbon vacancy diffusion using CB{\Omega}
theory.

recent years, convolutional neural networks have emerged as the dominant method

net to segment the image into vessel and background, and the vessel region is
used as an input for a second net which recognizes the contents of the glass
vessel. Transferring the segmentation map generated by the first nets to the
second net was performed using the valve filter attention method that involves
using different filters on different segments of the image. This modular
semantic segmentation method outperforms a single step method in which both the

environments for performing complex tasks such as multi-target tracking,
search-and-rescue, and intrusion detection. Notwithstanding the computational
limitations of individual robots, such systems rely on collaboration to sense
and react to the environment. This paper formulates the generic target tracking
problem as a time-varying optimization problem and puts forth an inexact online
gradient descent method for solving it sequentially. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is studied by characterizing its dynamic regret, a notion
common to the online learning literature. Building upon the existing results,
we provide improved regret rates that not only allow non-strongly convex costs
but also explicating the role of the cumulative gradient error. Two distinct
classes of problems are considered: one in which the objective function adheres
to a quadratic growth condition, and another where the objective function is
convex but the variable belongs to a compact domain. For both cases, results
are developed while allowing the error to be either adversarial or arising from
a white noise process. Further, the generality of the proposed framework is
demonstrated by developing online variants of existing stochastic gradient
algorithms and interpreting them as special cases of the proposed inexact
gradient method. The efficacy of the proposed inexact gradient framework is
established on a multi-agent multi-target tracking problem, while its
flexibility is exemplified by generating online movie recommendations for
Movielens $10$M dataset.

important to personalization and information filtering applications. However,
existing interest prediction methods are incapable of capturing the subtle
degreed user interests towards particular items, and the internal time-varying
drifting attention of individuals is not studied yet. Moreover, the prediction
process can also be affected by inter-personal influence, known as behavioral
mutual infectivity. Inspired by point process in modeling temporal point
process, in this paper we present a deep prediction method based on two
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to jointly model each user's continuous
browsing history and asynchronous event sequences in the context of inter-user
behavioral mutual infectivity. Our model is able to predict the fine-grained
interest from a user regarding a particular item and corresponding timestamps
when an occurrence of event takes place. The proposed approach is more flexible
to capture the dynamic characteristic of event sequences by using the temporal
point process to model event data and timely update its intensity function by
RNNs. Furthermore, to improve the interpretability of the model, the attention
mechanism is introduced to emphasize both intra-personal and inter-personal
behavior influence over time. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in fine-grained user interest

value problem is established in the following framework. The boundary value
problem consists of a second order parabolic equation defined on a time-varying
Lipschitz domain in a Euclidean space and of a mixed boundary condition
composed of a Robin and the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. It is assumed
that the time-varying domain is included in a fixed smooth domain and that a
certain part of the boundary of the time-varying domain is also included in the
boundary of the fixed domain, say the fixed boundary. The Robin condition is
imposed on a part of the boundary included in the fixed one and the Dirichlet
condition on the rest of the boundary. Such a parabolic boundary value problem
always has a unique weak solution for given data; however it does not possess a
classical or strong solution in general, even in the case of equations with
constant coefficients. The stochastic solution to the boundary value problem is
also considered and, by showing the equality between both the solutions, it is
obtained the probabilistic representation for the weak solution. Furthermore,
it is ensured that, for the weak solution, the stochastic solution gives a
version which is continuous up to the lateral boundary of the domain except the
border of the adjoining place imposed each of the boundary conditions. As an
application, it is shown the continuity property of a functional (cost
function) related to an optimal stopping problem motivated by an inverse
problem determining the shape of a domain.

generalized this concept as POD (Proof of Disposal), which, we believe,
provides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital

conclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each ADR and
automated pricing of tokens that represent the orbital debris being removed are
indeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is

three planets (only two of which are modelled) and an initial population of

Here we present a new type of nonlinear hybrid metasurfaces for the visible

phased gold nanohole array. The results indicate that a large SHG
susceptibility of ~0.1 nm/V at 810 nm is achieved, which is 2~3 orders of

fine-grained programmable nature allows the inherent parallelism in these
applications to be exploited for enhanced performance. As architectures have
evolved, FPGA vendors have added more heterogeneous resources to allow
often-used functions to be implemented with higher performance, at lower power
and using less area. DSP blocks, for example, have evolved from basic
multipliers to support the multiply-accumulate operations that are the core of
many signal processing tasks. While more features were added to DSP blocks,
their structure and connectivity has been optimised primarily for
one-dimensional signal processing. Basic operations in image processing are
similar, but performed in a two-dimensional structure, and hence, many of the
optimisations in newer DSP blocks are not exploited when mapping image
processing algorithms to them. We present a detailed study of two-dimensional
spatial filter implementation on FPGAs, showing how to maximise performance
through exploitation of DSP block capabilities, while also presenting a lean
border pixel management policy.

finite-element-discretized systems involve the introduction of a linear mapping
into a reduced set of unknowns, followed by Galerkin projection of the
governing equations onto a constant reduction basis. Though this reduces the
number of unknowns in the system, the computational cost for obtaining the
solution could still be high due to the prohibitive computational costs
involved in the evaluation of nonlinear terms. Hyper-reduction methods are then
seen as a fast way of approximating the nonlinearity in the system of
equations. In the finite element context, the energy conserving sampling and
weighing (ECSW) method has emerged as a stability and structure-preserving
method for hyper-reduction. Classical hyper-reduction techniques, however, are
applicable only in the context of linear mappings into the reduction subspace.
In this work, we extend the concept of hyper-reduction using ECSW to general
nonlinear mappings, while retaining its desirable stability and
structure-preserving properties. As a proof of concept, the proposed
hyper-reduction technique is demonstrated over models of a flat plate and a
realistic wing structure, whose dynamics has been shown to evolve over a
nonlinear (quadratic) manifold. An online speed-up of over one thousand times
relative to the full system has been obtained for the wing structure using the
proposed method, which is higher than its linear counterpart using the ECSW.

counts-in-cells as a function of foreground galaxy density, thereby providing a
large-scale measurement of both 2-point and 3-point statistics. Our method
extends our earlier work on trough lensing and is summarized as follows: given
a foreground (low redshift) population of galaxies, we divide the sky into
subareas of equal size but distinct galaxy density. We then measure lensing
around uniformly spaced points separately in each of these subareas, as well as
counts-in-cells statistics (CiC). The lensing signals trace the matter density
contrast around regions of fixed galaxy density. Through the CiC measurements
this can be related to the density profile around regions of fixed matter
density. Together, these measurements constitute a powerful probe of cosmology,
the skewness of the density field and the connection of galaxies and matter.
  In this paper we show how to model both the density split lensing signal and
CiC from basic ingredients: a non-linear power spectrum, clustering hierarchy
coefficients from perturbation theory and a parametric model for galaxy bias
and shot-noise. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that this model is
sufficiently accurate for a cosmological analysis on year 1 data from the Dark
Energy Survey.

under some weak regularity conditions. Simulation studies are conducted to

recently discovered orbital Feshbach resonance in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms.
Being a metastable quasiparticle excitation at the positive energy, the
repulsive polaron is induced by the interaction between an impurity atom and a
Fermi sea. By analyzing in detail the energy, the polaron residue, the
effective mass, and the decay rate of the repulsive polaron, we reveal
interesting features that are intimately related to the two-channel nature of
the orbital Feshbach resonance. In particular, we find that the life time of
the repulsive polaron is non-monotonic in the Zeeman-field detuning bewteen the
two channels, and has a maximum on the BEC-side of the resonance. Further, by
considering the stability of a mixture of the impurity and the majority atoms
against phase separation, we show that the itin- erant ferromagnetism may exist
near the orbital Feshbach resonance at appropriate densities. Our results can
be readily probed experimentally, and have interesting implications for the
observation of itinerant ferromagnetism near an orbital Feshbach resonance.

characteristic of these vanadium $d^2$ compounds with partly filled $t_{2g}$

of doped Mott-Hubbard insulators can be obtained with high precision within the
unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. In particular: (i) the atomic
multiplet excitations in the inverse photoemission spectra and the various
defect-related states and satellites are well reproduced, (ii) a robust Mott
gap survives up to large doping, and (iii) we show that the defect states
inside the Mott gap develop a soft gap at the Fermi energy. The soft defect
states gap can be characterized by a shape and a scale parameter extracted from
a Weibull statistical sampling of the density of states near the chemical

polarons, with their internal kinetic energy responsible for the opening of the
soft defect states gap. The small size of spin-orbital polarons is inferred by
an analysis of the inverse participation ratio which explains the origin of the
robustness of spin and orbital order. Using realistic parameters for

image group containing two or more relevant images. It is a newly emerging
topic in computer vision community. Different from the most existing
co-saliency methods focusing on RGB images, this paper proposes a novel
co-saliency detection model for RGBD images, which utilizes the depth
information to enhance identification of co-saliency. First, the intra saliency
map for each image is generated by the single image saliency model, while the
inter saliency map is calculated based on the multi-constraint feature
matching, which represents the constraint relationship among multiple images.
Then, the optimization scheme, namely Cross Label Propagation (CLP), is used to
refine the intra and inter saliency maps in a cross way. Finally, all the
original and optimized saliency maps are integrated to generate the final
co-saliency result. The proposed method introduces the depth information and
multi-constraint feature matching to improve the performance of co-saliency
detection. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively exploit any existing
single image saliency model to work well in co-saliency scenarios. Experiments
on two RGBD co-saliency datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
model.

allows the brain to perceive depth. However, depth information has not been
well explored in existing saliency detection models. In this letter, a novel
saliency detection method for stereoscopic images is proposed. Firstly, we
propose a measure to evaluate the reliability of depth map, and use it to
reduce the influence of poor depth map on saliency detection. Then, the input
image is represented as a graph, and the depth information is introduced into
graph construction. After that, a new definition of compactness using color and
depth cues is put forward to compute the compactness saliency map. In order to
compensate the detection errors of compactness saliency when the salient
regions have similar appearances with background, foreground saliency map is
calculated based on depth-refined foreground seeds selection mechanism and
multiple cues contrast. Finally, these two saliency maps are integrated into a
final saliency map through weighted-sum method according to their importance.
Experiments on two publicly available stereo datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method performs better than other 10 state-of-the-art approaches.

angles significantly exceeds its dayside brightness. The brightening that
occurs near back-illumination is due to moderately large haze particles in the
moon's extended atmosphere that forward-scatter the incident sunlight.
Motivated by this phenomenon, here we investigate the forward scattering from
currently known exoplanets, its diagnostics possibilities, the observational
requirements to resolve it, and potential implications. An analytical
expression is derived for the amount of starlight forward-scattered by an
exponential atmosphere that takes into account the finite angular size of the
star. We use this expression to tentatively estimate how prevalent this
phenomenon may be. Based on numerical calculations that consider exoplanet
visibility, we identify numerous planets with predicted out-of-transit forward
scattering signals of up to tens of parts-per-million provided that aerosols of
$>$1 micron size form over an extended vertical region near the optical radius
level. We propose that the interpretation of available optical phase curves
should be revised to constrain the strength of this phenomenon that might
provide insight into aerosol scale heights and particle sizes. For the
relatively general atmospheres considered here, forward scattering reduces the
transmission-only transit depth by typically less than the equivalent to a
scale height. For short-period exoplanets the finite angular size of the star
severely affects the amount of radiation scattered towards the observer at
mid-transit.

measuring the activity and connectivity of large populations of neurons in the
brain. However, as these techniques grow ever more powerful---allowing us to
even contemplate measuring every neuron in entire brain---a new problem arises:
how do we make sense of the mountains of data that these techniques produce?
Here, we argue that the time is ripe for building an intermediate or
""mesoscale"" computational theory that can bridge between single-cell
(microscale) accounts of neural function and behavioral (macroscale) accounts
of animal cognition and environmental complexity. Just as digital accounts of
computation in conventional computers abstract away the non-essential dynamics
of the analog circuits that implementing gates and registers, so too a
computational account of animal cognition can afford to abstract from the
non-essential dynamics of neurons. We argue that the geometry of neural
circuits is essential in explaining the computational limitations and
technological innovations inherent in biological information processing. We
propose a blueprint for how to employ tools from modern machine learning to
automatically infer a satisfying mesoscale account of neural computation that
combines functional and structural data, with an emphasis on learning and
exploiting regularity and repeating motifs in neuronal circuits. Rather than
suggest a specific theory, we present a new class of scientific instruments
that can enable neuroscientists to design, propose, implement and test

then deteriorate as the branch outage spreads quickly. Thus, it is crucial to

model predictive approach is proposed to protect power grids against cascading
blackout by timely shedding load on buses. The cascading dynamics of power
grids is described by a cascading outage model of transmission lines coupled
with the DC power flow equation. In addition, a nonlinear convex optimization
formulation is established to characterize the optimal load shedding for the
mitigation of cascading failures. As a result, two protection schemes are
designed on the basis of the optimization formulation. One scheme carries out
the remedial action once for all, while the other focuses on the consecutive
protection measures. Saddle point dynamics is employed to provide a numerical
solution to the proposed optimization problem, and its global convergence is
guaranteed in theory. Finally, numerical simulations on IEEE 57 Bus Systems
have been implemented to validate the proposed approach in terms of preventing
the degradation of power grids.

non-trivial higher dimensional effects. Note that this is \emph{different} from
the perturbation of the five dimensional gravitational field equations,
existing in literature, and possess quantitatively new features. The
gravitational perturbation has further been decomposed into a purely four
dimensional part and another piece that depends on extra dimensions. The four
dimensional gravitational perturbation now admits massive propagating degrees
of freedom, owing to the existence of higher dimensions. We have also studied
the influence of these massive propagating modes on the quasi-normal mode
frequencies, signaling the higher dimensional nature of the spacetime, and have
contrasted these massive modes with the massless modes in general relativity.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the massive modes experience much smaller
damping compared to the massless modes in general relativity and may even
\emph{dominate} over and above the general relativity contribution if one
observes the ringdown phase of a black hole merger event at sufficiently late
times. Furthermore, the whole analytical framework has been supplemented by the

early treatment of DR can be conducted from detection of microaneurysms (MAs)
which appears as reddish spots in retinal images. An automated microaneurysm
detection can be a helpful system for ophthalmologists. In this paper, deep
learning, in particular convolutional neural network (CNN), is used as a
powerful tool to efficiently detect MAs from fundus images. In our method a new
technique is used to utilise a two-stage training process which results in an
accurate detection, while decreasing computational complexity in comparison
with previous works. To validate our proposed method, an experiment is
conducted using Keras library to implement our proposed CNN on two standard
publicly available datasets. Our results show a promising sensitivity value of
about 0.8 at the average number of false positive per image greater than 6
which is a competitive value with the state-of-the-art approaches.

usability of registration, i.e., accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In
real-time applications, efficiency and robustness are more important. To
promote these two abilities, we cast the multi-view registration into a
clustering task. All the centroids are uniformly sampled from the initially
aligned point sets involved in the multi-view registration, which makes it
rather efficient and effective for the clustering. Then, each point is assigned
to a single cluster and each cluster centroid is updated accordingly.
Subsequently, the shape comprised by all cluster centroids is used to
sequentially estimate the rigid transformation for each point set. For accuracy
and stability, clustering and transformation estimation are alternately and
iteratively applied to all point sets. We tested our proposed approach on
several benchmark datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art approaches.
Experimental results validate its efficiency and robustness for the

form allows fits that quantify variations in the pickup H+ properties with
distance. By ~20 AU, the pickup ions already provide the dominant internal
pressure in the solar wind. We determine the radial trends and extrapolate them
to the termination shock at ~90 AU, where the pickup H+ to core solar wind
density reaches ~0.14. The pickup H+ temperature and thermal pressure increase
from 22-38 AU, indicating additional heating of the pickup ions. This produces
very large extrapolated ratios of pickup H+ to solar wind temperature and
pressure and an extrapolated ratio of the pickup ion pressure to the solar wind
dynamic pressure at the termination shock of ~0.16. Such a large ratio has
profound implications for moderating the termination shock and the overall
outer heliospheric interaction. We also identify suprathermal tails in the H+

in the pickup ion history and processing. Finally, we discover enhancements in
both H+ and He+ populations just below their cutoff energies, which may be

the latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the
former is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation,
since their predictions often disagree with experiments by orders of magnitude.
A theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group
theory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom and lacks
numerical evidence. Here we show that universal hysteresis scaling as predicted
by the renormalization-group theory emerges unambiguously when the theory is
combined intimately with the theory of nucleation and growth in the FOPTs of
the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by a linearly varying
externally applied field below its critical point. This not only provides a new
method to rectify the nucleation theories, but also unifies the theories for
both classes of transitions and FOPTs can be studied using universality and
scaling similar to their continuous counterpart.

years, many researches have focused on feature learning methods in social
networks. Network embedding represents the network in a lower dimensional
representation space with the same properties which presents a compressed
representation of the network. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm
named ""CARE"" for network embedding that can be used for different types of

preserve local neighborhood information of nodes, whereas the proposed method
utilizes local neighborhood and community information of network nodes to cover
both local and global structure of social networks. CARE builds customized
paths, which are consisted of local and global structure of network nodes, as a
basis for network embedding and uses the Skip-gram model to learn
representation vector of nodes. Subsequently, stochastic gradient descent is
applied to optimize our objective function and learn the final representation
of nodes. Our method can be scalable when new nodes are appended to network
without information loss. Parallelize generation of customized random walks is
also used for speeding up CARE. We evaluate the performance of CARE on multi

  Heterogeneous Neuronal Networks",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for neuronal
computation. It is observed that the balanced state of neuronal networks exists
in many experiments, yet its underlying mechanism remains to be fully
clarified. Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the
analysis of the homogeneous Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi network. However,
neuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas.
In particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of
scale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine
the questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to
network topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in
inhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks. We discover
that, for a sparsely but strongly connected inhomogeneous network, despite that
the whole network receives external inputs, there is a small active subnetwork
(active core) inherently embedded within it. The neurons in this active core
have relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network
are quiescent. Surprisingly, the active core possesses a balanced state and
this state is independent of the model of single-neuron dynamics. The dynamics
of the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with
the mean-field assumption. Our results suggest that, in the presence of
inhomogeneous network connectivity, the balanced state may be ubiquitous in the
brain, and the network connectivity in the active core is essentially close to
the Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi structure. The existence of the small active
core embedded in a large network may provide a potential dynamical scenario
underlying sparse coding in neuronal networks.

and the corresponding exact solution are found by requirement of Noether
symmetry and Noether charge. A power-law f(T), the same as the FRW universe,
can satisfy the required Noether symmetry in the anisotropic universe with
power- law scale factor. It is regarded that positive expansion is satisfied by
a constrain between parameters.

  Foundations of Physics",,"10.1007/s10701-018-0217-5",,"quant-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complexified Lienard-Wiechert potentials simplify the mathematics of
Kerr-Newman particles. Here we constrain them by fiat to move along Bohmian
trajectories to see if anything interesting occurs, as their equations of
motion are not known. A covariant theory due to Stueckelberg is used. This
paper deviates from the traditional Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics
since the electromagnetic interactions of Kerr- Newman particles are dictated
by general relativity. A Gaussian wave function is used to produce the Bohmian
trajectories, which are found to be multi-valued. A generalized analytic
continuation (GAN) is introduced which leads to an infinite number of
trajectories. These include the entire set of Bohmian trajectories. This leads
to multiple retarded times which come into play in complex space-time. If one
weights these trajectories by their natural Bohmian weighting factors, then it
is found that the particles do not radiate, that they are extended, and that
they can have a finite electrostatic self energy, thus avoiding the usual
divergence of the charged point particle. This effort does not in any way
criticize or downplay the traditional Bohmian interpretation which does not
assume the standard electromagnetic coupling to charged particles, but it
suggests that a hybridization of Kerr-Newman particle theory with Bohmian
mechanics might lead to interesting new physics, and maybe even the possibility
of emergent quantum mechanics.

multidimensional parabolic (diffusion type) equation with variable coefficients
which depend on spatial variable but do not change over time. We assume the
existence of the $C_0$-semigroup (this is a standard assumption in the
evolution equations theory, which guarantees the existence of the solution) and
then find the representation (based on the family of translation operators) of
the solution in terms of coefficients of the equation and initial condition. It
is proved that if the coefficients of the equation are bounded, infinitely
smooth and satisfy some other conditions then there exists a solution-giving
$C_0$-semigroup of contraction operators. We also represent the solution as a
Feynman formula (i.e. as a limit of a multiple integral with multiplicity
tending to infinity) with generalized functions appearing in the integral
kernel.

mixture of alkane gas and SPC/E water, with alkane as solute and water as
solvent, have been carried out at different temperatures ranging from 283.15 K
to 333.15 K. We have taken a dilute solution of 3 alkane (methane, ethane,
propane and n-butane) molecules and 971 water molecules in a system. The role
of interaction in the structure of the constituents of the system as a function
of temperature is studied with the help of the radial distribution function
(RDF) and the coordination numbers. The self-diffusion coefficient of the
constituents of the mixture was calculated by using mean square displacement
(MSD) and the binary diffusion coefficients of alkane in water have been
calculated by using Darken's relation. The results are then compared with the
available experimental values. The values of self-diffusion coefficients of
water from the present work come in good agreement with the experimental values
within 9% error. The binary diffusion coefficients of ethane, methane, propane

dependence of the diffusion coefficients on temperature is approximated by
Arrhenius-type exponential relationship.

geometries. This idea has reappeared on occasion (e.g., Poincar\'{e}) but
didn't become key in space-time foundations prior to Brown's \emph{Physical
Relativity} (at the end, the interpretive key to the book). A crucial
difference between his constructivism and orthodox ""space-time realism"" is
modal scope. Constructivism applies to all local classical field theories,
including those with multiple geometries. But the orthodox view provincially
assumes a unique geometry, as familiar theories (Newton, Special Relativity,
Nordstr\""{o}m, and GR) have. They serve as the orthodox ""canon."" Their
historical roles suggest a story of inevitable progress. Physics literature
after c. 1920 is relevant to orthodoxy mostly as commentary on the canon, which
closed in the 1910s. The orthodox view explains the behavior of matter as the
manifestation of the real space-time geometry, which works within the canon.
The orthodox view, Whiggish history, and the canon relate symbiotically.
  If one considers a theory outside the canon, space-time realism sheds little
light on matter's behavior. Worse, it gives the wrong answer when applied to an
example arguably in the canon, massive scalar gravity with universal coupling.
Which is the true geometry---the flat metric from the Poincar\'{e} symmetry,
the conformally flat metric exhibited by material rods and clocks, or both---or
is the question bad? How does space-time realism explain that all matter fields
see the same curved geometry, given so many ways to mix and match?
Constructivist attention to dynamical details is vindicated; geometrical
shortcuts disappoint. The more exhaustive exploration of relativistic field
theories (especially massive) in particle physics is an underused resource for
foundations.

(SMAUG+), an advanced numerical code for solving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)

of accelerated codes and enable us to investigate larger model sizes and/or
more detailed computational domain resolutions. This is a significant
advancement over the parent single-GPU MHD code, SMAUG (Griffiths, M., Fedun,
V., and Erd\'elyi, R. (2015). A fast MHD code for gravitationally stratified
media using graphical processing units: SMAUG. Journal of Astrophysics and
Astronomy,36(1):197-223). Here, we demonstrate the validity of the SMAUG+ code,
describe the parallelisation techniques and investigate performance benchmarks.
The initial configuration of the Orszag-Tang vortex simulations are distributed
among 4, 16, 64 and 100 GPUs. Furthermore, different simulation box resolutions
are applied: $1000 \times 1000$, $2044 \times 2044$, $4000 \times 4000$ and
$8000 \times 8000$. We also tested the code with the Brio-Wu shock tube
simulations with model size of 800 employing up to 10 GPUs. Based on the test
results, we observed speed ups and slow downs, depending on the granularity and
the communication overhead of certain parallel tasks. The main aim of the code
development is to provide massively parallel code without the memory limitation
of a single GPU. By using our code, the applied model size could be
significantly increased. We demonstrate that we are able to successfully
compute numerically valid and large 2D MHD problems.

brain activity from combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
electroencephalography (EEG) data. The resulting inverse problem is ill-posed
and is one of the most difficult problems in neuroimaging data analysis. In our
development we propose a solution that combines the data from three different
modalities, MRI, MEG, and EEG, together. We propose a new Bayesian spatial
finite mixture model that builds on the mesostate-space model developed by
Daunizeau and Friston (2007). Our new model incorporates two major extensions:
(i) We combine EEG and MEG data together and formulate a joint model for
dealing with the two modalities simultaneously; (ii) we incorporate the Potts
model to represent the spatial dependence in an allocation process that
partitions the cortical surface into a small number of latent states termed
mesostates. The cortical surface is obtained from MRI. We formulate the new
spatiotemporal model and derive an efficient procedure for simultaneous point
estimation and model selection based on the iterated conditional modes
algorithm combined with local polynomial smoothing. The proposed method results
in a novel estimator for the number of mixture components and is able to select
active brain regions which correspond to active variables in a high-dimensional
dynamic linear model. The methodology is investigated using synthetic data and
simulation studies and then demonstrated on an application examining the neural
response to the perception of scrambled faces. R software implementing the
methodology along with several sample datasets are available at the following

underestimation of the role of spin in gravity. Relativistic rotation is
inseparable from spin, which for elementary particles is extremely high and
exceeds mass on 20-22 orders (in natural Planck units). Such a huge spin
generates frame-dragging that distorts space much stronger than mass, and
effective scale of gravitational interaction is shifted from Planck to Compton
distances. We show that compatibility between gravity and quantum theory can be
achieved without modifications of Einstein-Maxwell equations, by coupling to a
supersymmetric Higgs model of symmetry breaking and forming a non-perturbative
super-bag solution, which generates a gravity-free Compton zone necessary for
consistent work of quantum theory. Super-bag is naturally upgraded to
Wess-Zumino supersymmetric QED model, forming a bridge to perturbative
formalism of conventional QED.
