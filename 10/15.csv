important applications for malware analysis. A persistent limitation of prior
malware lineage approaches is to consider every input sample a separate malware
version. This is problematic since a majority of malware are packed and the
packing process produces many polymorphic variants (i.e., executables with
different file hash) of the same malware version. Thus, many samples correspond
to the same malware version and it is challenging to identify distinct malware
versions from polymorphic variants. This problem does not manifest in prior
malware lineage approaches because they work on synthetic malware, malware that
are not packed, or packed malware for which unpackers are available. In this
work, we propose a novel malware lineage approach that works on malware samples
collected in the wild. Given a set of malware executables from the same family,
for which no source code is available and which may be packed, our approach
produces a lineage graph where nodes are versions of the family and edges
describe the relationships between versions. To enable our malware lineage
approach, we propose the first technique to identify the versions of a malware
family and a scalable code indexing technique for determining shared functions
between any pair of input samples. We have evaluated the accuracy of our
approach on 13 open-source programs and have applied it to produce lineage
graphs for 10 popular malware families. Our malware lineage graphs achieve on
average a 26 times reduction from number of input samples to number of
versions.

solar activity with a claim of predicting/postdicting it for several millennia
ahead/backwards. The work contains several flaws devaluating the results: (1)
the method is unreliable from the point of view of signal processing (it is
impossible to make harmonic predictions for thousands of years based on only 35
years of data) and lacks quality control, (2) the result of post-diction
apparently contradicts the observational data. (3) theoretical speculations
make little sense, To summarize, a multi-harmonic mathematical model, hardly
related to full solar dynamo theory, is presented, which is not applicable to
realistic solar conditions because of the significant chaotic/stochastic
intrinsic component and strong non-stationarity of solar activity. The obtained
result is apparently inconsistent with the data in the past and thus cannot be
trusted for the future predictions.

scenarios are determined by simulatable risk factors. In the respective nested
simulation framework, the goal is to estimate portfolio tail risk, quantified
via VaR or TVaR of a given collection of future economic scenarios representing
factor levels at the risk horizon. Traditionally, evaluating portfolio losses
of an outer scenario is done by computing a conditional expectation via
inner-level Monte Carlo and is computationally expensive. We introduce several
inter-related machine learning techniques to speed up this computation, in
particular by properly accounting for the simulation noise. Our main workhorse
is an advanced Gaussian Process (GP) regression approach which uses
nonparametric spatial modeling to efficiently learn the relationship between
the stochastic factors defining scenarios and corresponding portfolio value.
Leveraging this emulator, we develop sequential algorithms that adaptively
allocate inner simulation budgets to target the quantile region. The GP
framework also yields better uncertainty quantification for the resulting
VaR/TVaR estimators that reduces bias and variance compared to existing
methods. We illustrate the proposed strategies with two case-studies in two and
six dimensions.

are distributed ""patchily"", with large gaps in between the patches. To describe
people's internal and external foraging behavior, various random walk models
have been proposed. In particular, internal foraging has been modeled as
sampling: in order to gather relevant information for making a decision, people
draw samples from a mental representation using random-walk algorithms such as
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, two common empirical observations
argue against simple sampling algorithms such as MCMC. First, the spatial
structure is often best described by a L\'evy flight distribution: the
probability of the distance between two successive locations follows a
power-law on the distances. Second, the temporal structure of the sampling that
humans and other animals produce have long-range, slowly decaying serial
correlations characterized as $1/f$-like fluctuations. We propose that mental
sampling is not done by simple MCMC, but is instead adapted to multimodal
representations and is implemented by Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MC$^3$), one of the first algorithms developed for sampling from
multimodal distributions. MC$^3$ involves running multiple Markov chains in
parallel but with target distributions of different temperatures, and it swaps
the states of the chains whenever a better location is found. Heated chains
more readily traverse valleys in the probability landscape to propose moves to
far-away peaks, while the colder chains make the local steps that explore the
current peak or patch. We show that MC$^3$ generates distances between
successive samples that follow a L\'evy flight distribution and $1/f$-like
serial correlations, providing a single mechanistic account of these two
puzzling empirical phenomena.

model silica pores of two different morphologies and various sizes. For
spherical pores, for all the pore sizes (diameters) exceeding 2~nm, we obtained
a logarithmic dependence of fluid modulus on the vapor pressure. Calculation of
the modulus at saturation showed that the modulus of the fluid in spherical
pores is a linear function of the reciprocal pore size. The calculation of the
modulus of the fluid in cylindrical pores appeared too scattered to make
quantitative conclusions. We performed additional simulations at higher
temperature (119.6~K), at which Monte Carlo insertions and removals become more
efficient. The results of the simulations at higher temperature confirmed both
regularities for cylindrical pores and showed quantitative difference between
the fluid moduli in pores of different geometries. Both of the observed

information to separate bulge types. We intended to derive accurate constraints
to the intrinsic shape of bulges to provide new clues on their formation
mechanisms and set new limitations for future simulations. We retrieved the
intrinsic shape of a sample of CALIFA bulges using a statistical approach.
Taking advantage of GalMer numerical simulations of binary mergers we estimated
the reliability of the procedure. Analyzing the $i$-band mock images of
resulting lenticular remnants, we studied the intrinsic shape of their bulges
at different galaxy inclinations. Finally, we introduced a new ($B/A$, $C/A$)
diagram to analyze possible correlations between the intrinsic shape and the
properties of bulges. We tested the method on simulated lenticular remnants,
finding that for galaxies with inclinations $25^{\circ} < \theta < 65^{\circ}$
we can safely derive the intrinsic shape of their bulges. We found that our
CALIFA bulges tend to be nearly oblate systems (66%), with a smaller fraction
of prolate spheroids (19%) and triaxial ellipsoids (15%). The majority of
triaxial bulges are in barred galaxies (75%). Moreover, we found that bulges
with low S\'ersic indices or in galaxies with low bulge-to-total luminosity
ratios form a heterogeneous class of objects; additionally, also bulges in
late-type galaxies or in less massive galaxies have no preference in being
oblate, prolate, or triaxial. On the contrary, bulges with high S\'ersic index,
in early-type galaxies, or in more massive galaxies are mostly oblate systems.
We concluded that various evolutionary pathways may coexist in galaxies, with
merging events and dissipative collapse being the main mechanisms driving the
formation of the most massive oblate bulges and bar evolution reshaping the
less massive triaxial bulges.

have been slow to post electronic versions of papers on sites like arXiv.org.
Instead, computer scientists have tended to place papers on our individual home

  But this is changing. More and more computer scientists are now using the

prepublication affects peer review, especially for double-blind conferences.
This discussion is often carried out with precious little evidence of how
popular prepublication is.
  We measure what percentage of papers in computer science are placed on the
arXiv, by cross-referencing published papers in DBLP with e-prints on arXiv. We
found:
  * Usage of arXiv.org has risen dramatically among the most selective
conferences in computer science. In 2017, fully 23% of papers had e-prints on
arXiv, compared to only 1% ten years ago.
  * Areas of computer science vary widely in e-print prevalence. In theoretical
computer science and machine learning, over 60% of published papers are on
arXiv, while other areas are essentially zero. In most areas, arXiv usage is
rising.
  * Many researchers use arXiv for posting preprints. Of the 2017 published

during peer review.

low-latency computation by jointly exploiting the radio and computing resources
of end-user devices and cloud servers. However, the dynamic and distributed
formation of local fog networks is highly challenging due to the unpredictable
arrival and departure of neighboring fog nodes. Therefore, a given fog node
must properly select a set of neighboring nodes and intelligently offload its
computational tasks to this set of neighboring fog nodes and the cloud in order
to achieve low-latency transmission and computation. In this paper, the problem
of fog network formation and task distribution is jointly investigated while
considering a hybrid fog-cloud architecture. The goal is to minimize the
maximum computational latency by enabling a given fog node to form a suitable
fog network and optimize the task distribution, under uncertainty on the
arrival process of neighboring fog nodes. To solve this problem, a novel online
optimization framework is proposed in which the neighboring nodes are selected
by using a threshold-based online algorithm that uses a target competitive
ratio, defined as the ratio between the latency of the online algorithm and the
offline optimal latency. The proposed framework repeatedly updates its target
competitive ratio and optimizes the distribution of the fog node's
computational tasks in order to minimize latency. Simulation results show that
the proposed framework can successfully select a set of neighboring nodes while
reducing latency by up to 19.25% compared to a baseline approach based on the
well-known online secretary framework. The results also show how, using the
proposed framework, the computational tasks can be properly offloaded between
the fog network and a remote cloud server in different network settings.

previous estimates derived by analogy with geophysical double-diffusive
convection. Using these results in combination with a core-erosion model

more appropriate in the presence of a well-established double-diffusive

iterations) on the convergence behavior of multi-agent system. We show that the
algorithm linearly converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution under

health monitoring by modeling the damage and degradation mechanism dynamics as
""slow"" states that are augmented with the system ""fast"" dynamical states. This
augmentation results in a two-time scale nonlinear system that is utilized for
development of health estimation and prediction modules within a health
monitoring framework. Towards this end, a two-time scale filtering approach is
developed based on the ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) approach by taking
advantage of the model reduction concept. The performance of our proposed
two-time scale ensemble Kalman filters is shown to be superior and less
computationally intensive in terms of the equivalent flop (EF) complexity
metric when compared to well-known particle filtering (PF) approaches. Our
proposed methodology is then applied to a gas turbine engine that is affected
by erosion of the turbine as the degradation phenomenon and damage mechanism.
Extensive comparative studies are conducted to validate and demonstrate the
advantages and capabilities of our proposed framework and methodology.

by an all-silicon tracker (comprising an inner Pixel tracker and outer Strip
tracker). The software currently used for the new silicon tracker is broadly
inherited from that used for the LHC Run-1 and Run-2, but many new developments
have been made to better fulfill the future detector and operation
requirements. One aspect in particular which will be highlighted is the
simulation software for the Strip tracker. The available geometry description
software (including the detailed description for all the sensitive elements,
the services, etc.) did not allow for accurate modelling of the planned
detector design. A range of sensors/layouts for the Strip tracker are being
considered and must be studied in detailed simulations in order to assess the
performance and ascertain that requirements are met. For this, highly
flexibility geometry building is required from the simulation software. A new
Xml-based detector description framework has been developed to meet the
aforementioned challenges. We will present the design of the framework and its

intelligence with a wide variety of applications, such as probabilistic
inference, decision making under uncertainty, and probabilistic databases.
Consequently, the problem is of theoretical as well as practical interest. When
the constraints are expressed as DNF formulas, Monte Carlo-based techniques
have been shown to provide a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme
(FPRAS). For CNF constraints, hashing-based approximation techniques have been
demonstrated to be highly successful. Furthermore, it was shown that
hashing-based techniques also yield an FPRAS for DNF counting without usage of
Monte Carlo sampling. Our analysis, however, shows that the proposed
hashing-based approach to DNF counting provides poor time complexity compared
to the Monte Carlo-based DNF counting techniques. Given the success of
hashing-based techniques for CNF constraints, it is natural to ask: Can
hashing-based techniques provide an efficient FPRAS for DNF counting? In this
paper, we provide a positive answer to this question. To this end, we introduce
two novel algorithmic techniques: \emph{Symbolic Hashing} and \emph{Stochastic
Cell Counting}, along with a new hash family of \emph{Row-Echelon hash
functions}. These innovations allow us to design a hashing-based FPRAS for DNF
counting of similar complexity (up to polylog factors) as that of prior works.
Furthermore, we expect these techniques to have potential applications beyond
DNF counting.

investigated by suddenly changing the on-site potential from zero to various
finite values which fall into the extended, critical and localized phase
regimes shown in this model. The time evolutions of entanglement entropy (EE),
mean width of wave packets and Loschmidt echo of the system exhibit distinct
but consistent dynamical signatures in those three phases. Specifically, the EE
grows as a power function of time with the exponent of which varies in the
extended phase but keeps almost unchanged in the critical phase for different
quench parameters. However, if the system is in the localized phase after a
quench, the EE grows much slower and will soon get saturated. The
time-dependent width of wave packets in the system shows similar behaviors as
the EE. In addition, from the perspective of dynamical phase transition, we
find that the Loschmidt echo oscillates and always keeps finite when the system
is quenched in the extended phase. In contrast, in the critical or localized
phase, the echo will reach to zero at some time intervals or will decay almost
to zero after a long-time evolution. The universal features of these quantities
in the critical phase of the system with various SC pairing amplitudes are also

interesting problem is to use these ranking lists and find a stable matching in
the sense of Gale and Shapley. This problem formulation naturally models
preferences in several real world applications; for example, dating sites, room

in this setting are: (a) When is the stable matching unique without resorting
to tie breaks? (b) If $X$ is the distance between a randomly chosen stable
pair, what is the distribution of $X$ and what is $E(X)$?
  We study dating sites and ride hailing as prototypical examples of stable
matchings in discrete and continuous metric spaces, respectively. In the dating
site model, each person is assigned to a point on the $k$-dimensional hypercube
based on their answers to a set of binary $k$ questions. We consider two
different metrics on the hypercube: Hamming and Weighted Hamming. Under both
metrics, there are exponentially many stable matchings when $k = \lfloor\log
n\rfloor$. There is a unique stable matching, with high probability, under the
Hamming distance when $k = \Omega(n^6)$, and under the Weighted Hamming
distance when $k > (2+\epsilon) \log n$ for some $\epsilon>0$. In the ride
hailing model, passengers and cabs are modeled as points on the line and
matched based on Euclidean distance. Assuming the locations of the passengers
and cabs are independent Poisson processes of different intensities, we derive
bounds on the distribution of $X$ in terms of busy periods at a

after removing which the remaining graph will break into connected components
of sub-extensive size, but we should also consider the efficiency of
intermediate states during the entire dismantling process, which is measured by
the general performance R in this paper. In order to improve the general
performance of the belief-propagation decimation (BPD) algorithm, we introduce
a compound algorithm (CA) mixing the BPD and the node explosive percolation
(NEP) algorithm. In this CA, the NEP algorithm will rearrange and optimize the
head part of a dismantling sequence given by the BPD. Two ancestor algorithms
are connected at the joint point where the general performance can be
optimized. It dismantles a graph to small pieces as quickly as the BPD, and it
is with the efficiency of the NEP during the entire dismantling process. We
find that a wise joint point is where the BPD breaks the original graph to
subgraphs no longer larger than the 1% of the original one. We refer the CA
with this settled joint point as the fast CA and the fast CA is in the same
complexity class with the BPD algorithm. The computation on some real-world
instances also exhibits that using the fast CA to optimize the intermediate
process of a dismantling algorithm is an effective approach.

multi-dimensional MR Fingerprinting (MRF) data using Deep Learning methods.
  METHODS: A neural network (NN) is defined using the TensorFlow framework and
trained on simulated MRF data computed using the Bloch equations. The accuracy
of the NN reconstruction of noisy data is compared to conventional MRF template
matching as a function of training data size, and quantified in a both
simulated numerical brain phantom data and acquired data from the ISMRM/NIST
phantom. The utility of the method is demonstrated in a healthy subject in vivo
at 1.5 T.
  RESULTS: Network training required 10 minutes and once trained, data
reconstruction required approximately 10 ms. Reconstruction of simulated brain
data using the NN resulted in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 ms for T1
and 7.8 ms for T2. The RMSE for the NN trained on sparse dictionaries was
approximately 6 fold lower for T1 and 2 fold lower for T2 than conventional MRF
dot-product dictionary matching on the same dictionaries. Phantom measurements
yielded good agreement (R2=0.99) between the T1 and T2 estimated by the NN and
reference values from the ISMRM/NIST phantom.
  CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of MRF data with a NN is accurate, 300 fold faster
and more robust to noise and undersampling than conventional MRF dictionary
matching.

collected data is prediction: if a robot can learn to predict the future, it
can use this predictive model to take actions to produce desired outcomes, such
as moving an object to a particular location. However, in complex open-world
scenarios, designing a representation for prediction is difficult. In this
work, we instead aim to enable self-supervised robotic learning through direct
video prediction: instead of attempting to design a good representation, we
directly predict what the robot will see next, and then use this model to
achieve desired goals. A key challenge in video prediction for robotic
manipulation is handling complex spatial arrangements such as occlusions. To
that end, we introduce a video prediction model that can keep track of objects
through occlusion by incorporating temporal skip-connections. Together with a
novel planning criterion and action space formulation, we demonstrate that this
model substantially outperforms prior work on video prediction-based control.
Our results show manipulation of objects not seen during training, handling
multiple objects, and pushing objects around obstructions. These results
represent a significant advance in the range and complexity of skills that can

consistency of community detection in stochastic block model (SBM). In most
applications of this framework, the community label is discrete. For example,
in \citep{bickel2009nonparametric,zhao2012consistency} the degree corrected SBM
is assumed to have a discrete degree parameter. In this paper, we generalize
the method of \cite{bickel2009nonparametric} to give consistency analysis of
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in SBM with continuous community label. We
show that there is a standard procedure to transform the $||\cdot||_2$ error
bound to the uniform error bound. We demonstrate the application of our general
results by proving the uniform consistency (strong consistency) of the MLE in
the exponential network model with interaction effect. Unfortunately, in the
continuous parameter case, the condition ensuring uniform consistency we
obtained is much stronger than that in the discrete parameter case, namely
$n\mu_n^5/(\log n)^{8}\rightarrow\infty$ versus $n\mu_n/\log
n\rightarrow\infty$. Where $n\mu_n$ represents the average degree of the
network. But continuous is the limit of discrete. So it is not surprising as we
show that by discretizing the community label space into sufficiently small
(but not too small) pieces and applying the MLE on the discretized community
label space, uniform consistency holds under almost the same condition as in
discrete community label space. Such a phenomenon is surprising since the
discretization does not depend on the data or the model. This reminds us of the

recognition tasks due to their extraordinary performance. However, training a
good CNN model can still be a challenging task. In a training process, a CNN
model typically learns a large number of parameters over time, which usually
results in different performance. Often, it is difficult to explore the
relationships between the learned parameters and the model performance due to a
large number of parameters and different random initializations. In this paper,
we present a visual analytics approach to compare two different snapshots of a
trained CNN model taken after different numbers of epochs, so as to provide
some insight into the design or the training of a better CNN model. Our system
compares snapshots by exploring the differences in operation parameters and the
corresponding blob data at different levels. A case study has been conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

community probability $\pi_0,\pi_1$, and the connection probability between

$q_{ab}$ is constant in $a,b$, the random graph is simply the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}ny random graph. We evaluate the log partition function of the
Ising model on sparse SBM with two communities.
  As an application, we give consistent parameter estimation of the sparse SBM

average degree of the two communities, i.e.,
$d_0\overset{def}{=}\pi_0\alpha_{00}+\pi_1\alpha_{01},d_1\overset{def}{=}\pi_0\alpha_{10}+\pi_1\alpha_{11}$.
We focus on the regime $d_0=d_1$ (the regime $d_0\ne d_1$ is trivial). In this

the two largest sample eigenvalues are close to each other. By relying on the

They are studied using timing observations. The best studied neutron star in
this respect is the Crab Pulsar. The first glitch recorded in this pulsar
occurred in 1969 Sep, at an epoch when timing observations were still in their
infancy, the regularity of the observations was relatively poor, and errors on
the observations were relatively high. Lyne et al. (1993) analyzed most of the
available data using modern techniques, and showed that this was a typical
glitch of the Crab pulsar, with typical glitch parameters. This work analyses
all available data, and shows that the 1969 event in the Crab pulsar is
amenable to radically different interpretations. The Crab pulsar was timed by
five different groups during this epoch, one at radio and the rest at optical
frequencies. These data are available in the public domain, and have been
analyzed using the TEMPO2 software. The 1969 event in the Crab pulsar can be
better modeled as a typical glitch that was interrupted by a non-glitch
speed-up event. This work also confirms the existence of a quasi-sinusoidal
oscillation in the timing noise of the Crab pulsar, that was reported by
Richards et al. (1970), but with a smaller period, and with its amplitude and
period decreasing with time, like a chirp signal. Such a coherent oscillation
has not been noticed so far in either the Crab or any other pulsar. This work
provides an explanation for the post-glitch behavior of the Crab pulsar
glitches of 1969 Sep and 2004 Nov, and similar glitches in other pulsars, in
terms of the recently proposed non-glitch speed-up event. If true, then
non-glitch speed-up events may not be as rare as believed earlier. This work
argues that it is unlikely that the frequency and amplitude modulated
sinusoidal variation in the timing noise is due to unmodeled planetary
companions.

can also arise due to Andreev bound states (ABSs) localized at the end of an
island. We show that these two scenarios can be distinguished by an
interferometry experiment based on embedding a Coulomb-blockaded island into an
Aharonov-Bohm ring. For two ABSs, when the ground state is nearly degenerate,
cotunneling can change the state of the island and interference is suppressed.
By contrast, for two MBSs the ground state is nondegenerate and cotunneling has
to preserve the island state, which leads to $h / e$-periodic conductance
oscillations with magnetic flux. Such interference setups can be realized with
semiconducting nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases with
proximity-induced superconductivity and may also be a useful spectroscopic tool
for parity-flip mechanisms.

ultraviolet (EUV) light as transient bright fronts of finite width, propagating
away from the eruption source. Recent studies of individual solar eruptive
events have used EUV observations of CBFs and metric radio type II burst
observations to show the intimate connection between low coronal waves and
coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shocks. EUV imaging with the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly(AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has
proven particularly useful for detecting CBFs, which, combined with radio and
in situ observations, holds great promise for early CME-driven shock
characterization capability. This characterization can further be automated,
and related to models of particle acceleration to produce estimates of particle
fluxes in the corona and in the near Earth environment early in events. We

combines analysis of NASA Heliophysics System Observatory data products and
relevant data-driven models, into an automated system for the characterization
of off-limb coronal waves and shocks and the evaluation of their capability to

Nevertheless, the only known construction of bounded degree high dimensional

  In this work, we construct new families of bounded degree high dimensional
expanders obeying the local spectral expansion property. This property has a
number of important consequences, including geometric overlapping, fast mixing
of high dimensional random walks, agreement testing and agreement expansion.
Our construction also yields new families of expander graphs which are close to
the Ramanujan bound, i.e., their spectral gap is close to optimal.
  The construction is quite elementary and it is presented in a self contained
manner; This is in contrary to the highly involved previously known
construction of the Ramanujan complexes. The construction is also very
symmetric (such symmetry properties are not known for Ramanujan complexes) ;
The symmetry of the construction could be used, for example, in order to obtain
good symmetric LDPC codes that were previously based on Ramanujan graphs.
  The main tool that we use for is the theory of coset geometries. Coset
geometries arose as a tool for studying finite simple groups. Here, we show
that coset geometries arise in a very natural manner for groups of elementary
matrices over any finitely generated algebra over a commutative unital ring. In
other words, we show that such groups act simply transitively on the top
dimensional face of a pure, partite, clique complex.

progress on the group sparsity approach to beam orientation optimization,
wherein beam angles are selected by solving a large scale fluence map
optimization problem with an additional group sparsity penalty term that
encourages most candidate beams to be inactive. The optimization problem is
solved using an accelerated proximal gradient method, the Fast Iterative
Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). We derive a closed-form expression
for a relevant proximal operator which enables the application of FISTA. The
proposed algorithm is used to create non-coplanar treatment plans for four
cases (including head and neck, lung, and prostate cases), and the resulting
plans are compared with clinical plans. The dosimetric quality of the group
sparsity treatment plans is superior to that of the clinical plans. Moreover,
the runtime for the group sparsity approach is typically about 5 minutes.
Problems of this size could not be handled using the previous group sparsity
method for beam orientation optimization, which was slow to solve much smaller
coplanar cases. This work demonstrates for the first time that the group
sparsity approach, when combined with an accelerated proximal gradient method
such as FISTA, works effectively for non-coplanar cases with 500-800 candidate

enjoy very different mostly well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts
for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV),
which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes
(airborne, via direct contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to
the load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and
virulence define further pathogenic lifestyles. To survive pathogens must
infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with
a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be
mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network,
three parameters/concepts appear to be key: the contact rate and the
infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third
the immunity of susceptible hosts. From here, what can be concluded about the
evolutionary strategies of viral pathogens? This is the biological question
addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results (Lange & Ferguson
2009, PLoS Comput Biol 5 (10): e1000536) and makes explicit connection to
another basic work on the evolution of pathogens (Grenfell et al. 2004, Science
303: 327-332). A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and
inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad
spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections,
childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn
out as local maxima of the fitness landscape. The models involve differential-
and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.

The IDE generates better solutions by efficient exploration and exploitation of

least $f^*_H(\epsilon)n^h$ copies of $H$, where $f^*_H$ is some tower-type

  Our main result here is a precise characterization of the tournaments $H$ for
which $f^*_H(\epsilon)$ is polynomial in $\epsilon$, stating that such a bound
is attainable if and only if $H$'s vertex set can be partitioned into two sets,

model and Van Opdorp model, respectively. This analysis showed that organic
aniso-type heterostructures based on methyl substituted perylene pigment and
iso-type heterostructures based on pentacene can be described by the models
proposed and developed for inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions. The optimal
conditions were determined for preparation of organic photosensitive
heterostructures, which absorb most part of solar radiation in visible and near
infrared range, as well as effectively generate and separate charge carriers on
the interface of heterojunction. The aniso-type and iso-type heterostructures
prepared under optimal conditions are perspective elements for development of
organic photoconverters, including organic solar cells.

  one-dimensional Anderson model","9 pages, 8 figures, extended derivations and discussion",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The entanglement entropy distribution of strongly disordered one dimensional
spin chains, which are equivalent to spinless fermions at half-filling on a
bond (hopping) disordered one-dimensional Anderson model, has been shown to
exhibit very distinct features such as peaks at integer multiplications of
$\ln(2)$, essentially counting the number of singlets traversing the boundary.
Here we show that for a canonical Anderson model with box distribution on-site
disorder and repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions the entanglement entropy
distribution also exhibits interesting features, albeit different than the
distribution seen for the bond disordered Anderson model. The canonical
Anderson model shows a broad peak at low entanglement values and one narrower
peak at $\ln(2)$. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations
reveal this structure and the influence of the disorder strength and the
interaction strength on its shape. A modified real space renormalization group
(RSRG) method was used to get a better understanding of this behavior. As might
be expected the peak centered at low values of entanglement entropy has a
tendency to shift to lower values as disorder is enhanced. A second peak
appears around the entanglement entropy value of $\ln(2)$,this peak is
broadened and no additional peaks at higher integer multiplications of $\ln(2)$
are seen. We attribute the differences in the distribution between the
canonical model and the broad hopping disorder to the influence of the on-site
disorder which breaks the symmetry across the boundary.

(3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Our study focuses on an individual 3G
detector and a network of up to four 3G detectors at different locations
including the US, Europe, China and Australia for the proposed Einstein
Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. We in particular examine the
effect of the Earth's rotation, as GW signals from BNS and low mass NSBH
systems could be hours long for 3G detectors. We find that, a time-dependent
antenna beam-pattern function can help better localize BNS and NSBH sources,
especially those edge-on ones. The medium angular resolution for one ET-D
detector is around 150 deg$^2$ for BNSs at a redshift of $z=0.1$. The medium
angular resolution for a network of two CE detectors in the US and Europe
respectively is around 20 deg$^2$ at $z=0.2$ for the simulated BNS and NSBH
samples. While for a network of two ET-D detectors, the similar angular
resolution can be achieved at a much higher redshift of $z=0.5$. The angular
resolution of a network of three detectors is mainly determined by the
baselines between detectors regardless of the CE or ET detector type. We
discuss the implications of our results to constrain the Hubble constant $H_0$,
the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and the equation-of-state (EoS) of dark
energy. We find that in general, if 10 BNSs or NSBHs at $z=0.1$ with known
redshifts are detected, $H_0$ can be measured with an accuracy of $0.9\%$. If
1000 face-on BNSs at $z<2$ are detected with known redshifts, we are able to
achieve $\Delta q_0=0.002$, or $\Delta w_0=0.03$ and $\Delta w_a=0.2$ for dark
energy.(Abridged version).

list of possible locations, the Searcher needs to find all the hidden objects
by visiting these locations one by one. To study this problem, we formulate new
game-theoretic models of discrete search between a Hider and a Searcher. The
Hider hides $k$ balls in $n$ boxes, and the Searcher opens the boxes one by one
with the aim of finding all the balls. Every time the Searcher opens a box she
must pay its search cost, and she either finds one of the balls it contains or
learns that it is empty. If the Hider is an adversary, an appropriate payoff
function may be the expected total search cost paid to find all the balls,
while if the Hider is Nature, a more appropriate payoff function may be the
difference between the total amount paid and the amount the Searcher would have
to pay if she knew the locations of the balls a priori (the regret). We give a
full solution to the regret version of this game, and a partial solution to the
search cost version. We also consider variations on these games for which the
Hider can hide at most one ball in each box. The search cost version of this
game has already been solved in previous work, and we give a partial solution
in the regret version.

algorithm: we propose a plot-selection objective and the LookOut algorithm to
approximate it with optimality guarantees, (c) generality: our explanation
algorithm is both domain- and detector-agnostic, and (d) scalability: we show
that LookOut scales linearly on the number of edges of the input graph. Our
experiments show that LookOut performs near-ideally in terms of maximizing
explanation objective on several real datasets including Enron e-mail and DBLP

author misunderstood ``glb'' to be set-theoretic intersection. But in this
case, ``glb'' is defined to be other than set-theoretic intersection such that
Theorem 25(3) is true.

We demonstrate that all three definitions of a fractional derivative lead to
the same infinite series of integer order derivatives. We find that functions
normally represented by Taylor series with a finite radius of convergence have
a corresponding integer derivative expansion with an infinite radius of
convergence. Specifically, we demonstrate robust convergence of the integer
derivative series for the hyperbolic secant (tangent) function, characterized
by a finite radius of convergence of the Taylor series $R=\pi/2$, which
describes bright (dark) soliton propagation in non-linear media. We also show
that for a plane wave, which has a Taylor series with an infinite radius of
convergence, as the number of terms in the integer derivative expansion
increases, the truncation error decreases. Finally, we illustrate the utility
of the truncated integer derivative series by solving two linear fractional
differential equations, where the fractional derivative is replaced by an
integer derivative series up to the second order derivative. We find that our
numerical results closely approximate the exact solutions given by the
Mittag-Leffler and Fox-Wright functions. Thus, we demonstrate that the
truncated expansion is a powerful method for solving linear fractional

this study includes these subtracted self-energies into vacuum energy expressed
by the constant Lambda (used in such as Lambda-CDM). In this study, the
self-energies in electrodynamics and macroscopic classical Einstein field
equations are examined, using the formalisms with the ultraviolet cutoff
scheme. One of the cutoff formalisms is the field theory in terms of the
step-function-type basis functions, developed by the present authors. The other
is a continuum theory of a fundamental particle with the same cutoff length.
Based on the effectiveness of the continuum theory with the cutoff length shown

field at a quantum level (classical self-energies are reduced to logarithmic
forms by quantum corrections). The cutoff length is then determined to
reproduce today's tiny value of Lambda for vacuum energy. Additionally, a field
with nonperiodic vanishing boundary conditions is treated, showing that the

the help of Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure. The low non-null
statistical complexity value obtained suggests that the blockchain may be
considered algorithmically complicated but hardly a complex system and unlikely
to enter a chaotic regime.

magnetocaloric effects (MCE) providing realistic proposals about materials that
should be chosen in the design of new refrigerator appliances around the room
temperature. Starting from a spin Hamiltonian including the exchange
interaction, the single-ion anisotropy and the applied magnetic field terms, we
have calculated the partition function at a given temperature and derived a set
of relevant physical quantities as magnetization, magnetic entropy and specific
heat and analyzed their behavior with atomic parameters as spin, exchange and
anisotropy. Using numerical programs that we developed by ourselves, we were
able to better elucidate the role of each microscopic parameter in order to
reinforce the relative cooling power (RCP) and give rise to optimal
performances of the refrigerant compound. This approach could be extended to
composite materials underscoring a giant MCE at room temperature.
