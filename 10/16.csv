beam plasma instabilities. The prominent amongst them being the collisionless
Weibel destabilization which spatially separates the forward propagating REB
and the return shielding currents. This results in the formation of REB current
filaments which are typically of the size of electron skin depth during the
linear stage of the instability. It has been observed that in the nonlinear
stage the filaments size increases as they merge with each other. With the help
of 2D PIC simulations in the plane perpendicular to the REB propagation, it is
shown that these mergers occur in two distinct nonlinear phases. In the first
phase, the total magnetic energy increases. Subsequently, however, during the
second phase, one observes a reduction in magnetic energy. It is shown that the
transition from one nonlinear regime to another occurs when the typical current
associated with individual filaments hits the Alfven threshold. In the second
nonlinear regime, therefore, the filaments can no longer permit any increase in
current. Magnetic reconnection events then dissipate the excess current (and
its associated magnetic energy) that would result from a merger process leading
to the generation of energetic electrons jets in the perpendicular plane. At
later times when there are only few filaments left the individual reconnection
events can be clearly identified. It is observed that in between such events
the magnetic energy remains constant and shows a sudden drop as and when two
filaments merge. The electron jets released in these recon- nection events are
thus responsible for the transverse heating which has been mentioned in some
previous studies [Honda et al. Phys. Plasmas 7, 1302 (2000)].

heat trace for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on functions on manifolds with
conic singularities. In this article we investigate how the terms in the
expansion reflect the geometry of the manifold. Since the general expansion
contains a logarithmic term, its vanishing is a necessary condition for
smoothness of the manifold. In the two-dimensional case this implies that the
constant term of the expansion contains a non-local term that determines the
length of the (circular) cross section and vanishes precisely if this length
equals $2\pi$, that is, in the smooth case. We proceed to the study of higher
dimensions. In the four-dimensional case, the logarithmic term in the expansion
vanishes precisely when the cross section is a spherical space form, and we
expect that the vanishing of a further singular term will imply again
smoothness, but this is not yet clear beyond the case of cyclic space forms. In
higher dimensions the situation is naturally more difficult. We illustrate this
in the case of cross sections with constant curvature. Then the logarithmic
term becomes a polynomial in the curvature with roots that are different from
1, which necessitates more vanishing of other terms, not isolated so far.

much theoretical interest for more than two decades. They are in particular
important for the analysis and interpretation of QCD simulations on a finite,
discrete space-time lattice. Most of these effects are closely related to the
phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of the chiral flavor symmetry and the
emergence of pions as light Goldstone bosons. These long-range fluctuations are
strongly affected by putting the system into a finite box, and an analysis with
different methods can be organized according to the interplay between pion mass
and box size. The finite volume also affects critical behavior at the chiral
phase transition in QCD. In the present review, I will be mainly concerned with
modeling such finite volume effects as they affect the thermodynamics of the
chiral phase transition for two quark flavors.
  I review recent work on the analysis of finite-volume effects which makes use
of the quark-meson model for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. To account for
the effects of critical long-range fluctuations close to the phase transition,
most of the calculations have been performed using non-perturbative
Renormalization Group (RG) methods. I give an overview over the application of
these methods to a finite volume. The method, the model and the results are put
into the context of related work in random matrix theory for very small
volumes, chiral perturbation theory for larger volumes, and related methods and
approaches. They are applied towards the analysis of finite-volume effects in
lattice QCD simulations and their interpretation, mainly in the context of the
chiral phase transition for two quark flavors.

observation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons
interacting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP)
effect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a
periodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations
near the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We
demonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with
periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation
by low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than
previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence
on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment
and theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the
production of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that
allow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum
effects for light generation in nanoscale devices. A tunable light source
integrated in an electron microscope would enable the development of novel
electron-optical correlated spectroscopic techniques, with additional

two-dimensional configurations, that is, maps $\mathbb Z^2 \rightarrow \mathcal
A$ where $\mathcal A$ is a finite set of symbols. Such configurations are often
understood as colorings of a two-dimensional square grid. Let $P_c(m,n)$ denote
the number of distinct $m \times n$ block patterns occurring in a configuration
$c$. Configurations satisfying $P_c(m,n) \leq mn$ for some $m,n \in \mathbb N$
are said to have low rectangular complexity. Nivat conjectured that such
configurations are necessarily periodic.
  Recently, Kari and the author showed that low complexity configurations can
be decomposed into a sum of periodic configurations. In this paper we show that
if there are at most two components, Nivat's conjecture holds. As a corollary
we obtain an alternative proof of a result of Cyr and Kra: If there exist $m,n

technique used in this paper combines the algebraic approach of Kari and the

this absorption. The median equivalent width ($W$(NaI$\lambda$5891) = 0.68 \AA)
is larger than what is observed in local clouds with similar HI column
densities but also in z<0.7 CaII systems detected in the SDSS. The systematic
presence of NaI absorption in these CI systems strongly suggests that the gas
is neutral and cold, maybe part of the diffuse molecular gas in the ISM of
high-redshift galaxies. Most of the systems (12 out of 17) have

strongly perturbed for most of these systems, which probably do not arise in
quiet disks and must be close to regions with intense star-formation activity

around the High-Mass young stellar object, G353.273+0.641. The innermost
accretion system of 100 au radius was resolved in a 45 GHz continuum image
taken with the Jansky-Very Large Array. Our spectral energy distribution
analysis indicated that the continuum could be explained by optically thick
dust emission. The total mass of the dusty system is $\sim$ 0.2 $M_{\sun}$ at
minimum and up to a few $M_{\sun}$ depending on the dust parameters. 6.7 GHz
CH$_{3}$OH masers associated with the same system were also observed with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array. The masers showed a spiral-like,
non-axisymmetric distribution with a systematic velocity gradient. The
line-of-sight velocity field is explained by an infall motion along a parabolic
streamline that falls onto the equatorial plane of the face-on system. The
streamline is quasi-radial and reaches the equatorial plane at a radius of 16
au. This is clearly smaller than that of typical accretion disks in High-Mass
star formation, indicating that the initial angular momentum was very small, or
the CH$_{3}$OH masers selectively trace accreting material that has small
angular momentum. In the former case, the initial specific angular momentum is
estimated to be 8 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ ($M_{*}$$/$10 $M_{\sun}$)$^{0.5}$ cm$^{2}$
s$^{-1}$, or a significant fraction of the initial angular momentum was removed
outside of 100 au. The physical origin of such a streamline is still an open
question and will be constrained by the higher-resolution ($\sim$ 10 mas)
thermal continuum and line observations with ALMA long baselines.

fundamental physics and potential applications of transition metal
dichalcogenides. Here, the phenomenon of oxygen impurities trapping
photo-excited carriers has been studied with ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy.
Oxygen impurities are intentionally created in exfoliated multilayer MoSe2 with
Ar+ plasma irradiation and air exposure. After plasma treatment, the signal of
transient absorption first increases and then decreases, which is a signature
of defect capturing carriers. With larger density of oxygen defects, the
trapping effect becomes more prominent. The trapping defect densities are
estimated from the transient absorption signal, and its increasing trend in the
longer-irradiated sample agrees with the results from X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. First principle calculations with density functional theory
reveal that oxygen atoms occupying Mo vacancies create mid-gap defect states,
which are responsible for the carrier trapping. Our findings shed light on the
important role of oxygen defects as carrier trappers in transition metal
dichalcogenides, and facilitates defect engineering in relevant material and
device applications.

control problems by combining variational auto-encoders with locally-optimal
controllers. However, the E2C model suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) its
objective function does not correspond to the likelihood of the data sequence
and 2) the variational encoder used for embedding typically has large
variational approximation error, especially when there is noise in the system
dynamics. In this paper, we present a new model for learning robust
locally-linear controllable embedding (RCE). Our model directly estimates the
predictive conditional density of the future observation given the current one,
while introducing the bottleneck between the current and future observations.
Although the bottleneck provides a natural embedding candidate for control, our
RCE model introduces additional specific structures in the generative graphical
model so that the model dynamics can be robustly linearized. We also propose a
principled variational approximation of the embedding posterior that takes the
future observation into account, and thus, makes the variational approximation
more robust against the noise. Experimental results show that RCE outperforms
the E2C model, and does so significantly when the underlying dynamics is noisy.

process of metallic materials is numerically analyzed using the strain-gradient
plasticity (SGP) theory established from the Taylor dislocation model. Since
large deformations generally occur in the vicinity of a crack, the numerical
framework of the chosen SGP theory is developed for allowing large strains and
rotations. The material model is implemented in a commercial finite element
(FE) code by a user subroutine, and crack-tip fields are evaluated thoroughly
for both infinitesimal and finite deformation theories by a boundary-layer
formulation. An extensive parametric study is conducted and differences in the
stress distributions ahead of the crack tip, as compared with conventional
plasticity, are quantified. As a consequence of the strain-gradient
contribution to the work hardening of the material, FE results show a
significant increase in the magnitude and the extent of the differences between
the stress fields of SGP and conventional plasticity theories when finite
strains are considered. Since the distance from the crack tip at which the
strain gradient significantly alters the stress field could be one order of
magnitude higher when large strains are considered, results reveal that the
plastic size effect could have important implications in the modelization of
several damage mechanisms where its influence has not yet been considered in
the literature.

complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of
imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several
methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training,
and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main
evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is
associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based
on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class
imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of
addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed
scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level
that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling
ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical
machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v)
thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when
overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.

quantum correlations between particles. In the condensed matter physics,
studies often are restricted to the 1st neighbor particles. In this work, we
consider the 1D XXZ model in a transverse magnetic field (TF) which is not
integrable except at specific points. Analytical expressions for quantum
correlations (entanglement and quantum discord) between spin pairs at any
distance are obtained for both zero and finite temperature, using an analytical
approach proposed by Caux et al. [PRB 68, 134431 (2003)]. We compare the
efficiency of the QD with respect to the entanglement in the detection of
critical points (CPs) as the neighboring spin pairs go farther than the next
nearest neighbors. In the absence of the TF and at zero temperature, we show
that the QD for spin pairs farther than the 2nd neighbors is able to capture
the critical points while the pairwise entanglement is absent. In contrast to
the pairwise entanglement, two-site quantum discord is effectively long-range
in the critical regimes where it decays algebraically with the distance between
pairs. We also show that the thermal quantum discord between neighbor spins
possesses strong distinctive behavior at the critical point that can be seen at
finite temperature and, therefore, spotlights the critical point while the
entanglement fails in this task.

exponent $p$. Such a group is called special if the center lies within its
derived group. Every group of class 2 and exponent $p$ can be uniquely
expressed as the direct product of an elementary abelian group and a special
group. This reduces the isomorphism problem to special groups. The special
groups having $G'$ cyclic are well known. Groups having $|G'|=p^2$ are known to
be generated by two abelian subgroups. As such, they can be described by a pair
of Scharlau Matrices which we will define. Using these, Vishnevetskii ([1],
[2]) classified the special groups which are not central products of groups of
smaller order. We call these Vishnevetskii indecomposable. All decomposable
groups are central products of two or more indecomposable groups. By Theorem 2
of [2], if $G$ is a special group with derived group of order $p^2$ then the
indecomposable central factors of $G$, together with their multiplicities, form
a set of invariants for $G$. However these invariants do not determine $G$,
since (as we will show below) two nonisomorphic groups can have the same
indecomposable central factors. The groups of exponent $p$ and order dividing
$p^8$ are already in the literature. In this paper we prove that there are six
isomorphism types of special groups of order $p^9$ having $|G'|=p^2$, and we
list them.
  We will also introduce a way of representing groups of class 2 having
exponent $p$ by using digraphs with flows on the edges. The digraph is compact
and gives, on sight, a great deal of structural information about the group and
completely defines the group. Some group invariants will also be described
which are easy to compute from the digraphs and which can readily be used to
distinguish the isomorphism types for small orders.

velocity in (RE)BaCuO thin films grown on a flexible metallic substrate, also
called superconducting tapes. The key idea behind this approach is to use a
specific geometry of the silver thermal stabilizer that surrounds the
superconducting tape. More specifically, a very thin layer of silver stabilizer
is deposited on top of the superconductor layer, typically less than 100 nm,
while the remaining stabilizer (still silver) is deposited on the substrate
side. Normal zone propagation velocities up to 170 cm/s have been measured
experimentally, corresponding to a stabilizer thickness of 20 nm on top of the
superconductor layer. This is one order of magnitude faster than the speed
measured on actual commercial tapes. Our results clearly demonstrate that a
very thin stabilizer on top of the superconductor layer leads to high normal
zone propagation velocities. The experimental values are in good agreement with
predictions realized by finite element simulations. Furthermore, the
propagation of the normal zone during the quench was recorded in situ and in
real time using a high-speed camera. Due to high Joule losses generated on both
edges of the tape sample, a ""U-shaped"" profile could be observed at the
boundaries between the superconducting and the normal zones, which matches very
closely the profile predicted by the simulations.

variety is a subvariety of a flag variety identified by two parameters: an
element $X$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a Hessenberg subspace
$H\subseteq \mathfrak{g}$. This paper considers when two Hessenberg spaces
define the same Hessenberg variety when paired with $X$. To answer this
question we present the containment poset $\mathcal{P}_X$ of type $A$
Hessenberg varieties with a fixed first parameter $X$ and prove directly that
if $X$ is not a multiple of the element $\bf 1$ then the Hessenberg spaces
containing the Borel subalgebra determine distinct Hessenberg varieties. Lastly
we give a natural involution on $\mathcal{P}_X$ that induces a homeomorphism of

of non-identical, moderately charged colloidal particles trapped at an

simplified model system we solve the problem analytically within the framework

In the first step, we calculate the electrostatic potential inside the system
exactly as well as within the widely used superposition approximation. Then
these results are used to calculate the surface and line interaction energy
densities between the particles. Contrary to the case of identical particles,
depending upon the parameters of the system, we obtain that both the surface

between the particles and the superposition approximation fails to predict the
correct qualitative behaviours in most cases. Additionally, the superposition
approximation is unable to predict the energy contributions quantitatively even
at large distances. We also provide expression for the constant (independent of
the inter-particle separation) interaction parameters, i.e., the surface
tension, the line tension and the interfacial tension. Our results are expected
to be of use for modelling particle-interaction at fluid interfaces and, in

understand the energy efficiency of CNNs during serving for making an

accurate prediction and breakdown for power and runtime across all layers in
the whole network, helping machine learners quickly identify the power,
runtime, or energy bottlenecks. We also propose the ""energy-precision ratio""
(EPR) metric to guide machine learners in selecting an energy-efficient CNN
architecture that better trades off the energy consumption and prediction
accuracy. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the
proposed NeuralPower outperforms the best published model to date, yielding an
improvement in accuracy of up to 68.5%. We also assess the accuracy of
predictions at the network level, by predicting the runtime, power, and energy
of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, achieving an average accuracy of 88.24%

corroborate the effectiveness of NeuralPower as a powerful framework for
machine learners by testing it on different GPU platforms and Deep Learning

continuous control skills parametrized by deep neural networks are learned from
demonstrations. We extend DDO with: (1) a hybrid categorical-continuous
distribution model to parametrize high-level policies that can invoke discrete
options as well continuous control actions, and (2) a cross-validation method
that relaxes DDO's requirement that users specify the number of options to be
discovered. We evaluate DDCO in simulation of a 3-link robot in the vertical

experiments on the da Vinci surgical robot, needle insertion where a needle is
grasped and inserted into a silicone tissue phantom, and needle bin picking
where needles and pins are grasped from a pile and categorized into bins. In

(binary or non-binary) classifiers, orderings/rankings of items, or clusterings

equivalence query model and Littlestone's online learning model: in each
iteration, the algorithm proposes a model, and the user either accepts it or
reveals a specific mistake in the proposal. The feedback is correct only with
probability $p > 1/2$ (and adversarially incorrect with probability $1 - p$),
i.e., the algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise.
The algorithm's goal is to learn the ground truth model using few iterations.
  Our general framework is based on a graph representation of the models and
user feedback. To be able to learn efficiently, it is sufficient that there be
a graph $G$ whose nodes are the models and (weighted) edges capture the user
feedback, with the property that if $s, s^*$ are the proposed and target
models, respectively, then any (correct) user feedback $s'$ must lie on a
shortest $s$-$s^*$ path in $G$. Under this one assumption, there is a natural
algorithm reminiscent of the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, which
will efficiently learn $s^*$ even in the presence of noise in the user's
feedback.
  From this general result, we rederive with barely any extra effort classic
results on learning of classifiers and a recent result on interactive
clustering; in addition, we easily obtain new interactive learning algorithms
for ordering/ranking.

elevated treatment effects. This paper takes a machine learning approach and
introduces a generative model, Causal Rule Sets (CRS), for interpretable
subgroup discovery. A CRS model uses a small set of short decision rules to
capture a subgroup where the average treatment effect is elevated. We present a
Bayesian framework for learning a causal rule set. The Bayesian model consists
of a prior that favors simple models for better interpretability as well as
avoiding overfitting, and a Bayesian logistic regression that captures the
likelihood of data, characterizing the relation between outcomes, attributes,
and subgroup membership. The Bayesian model has tunable parameters that can
characterize subgroups with various sizes, providing users with more flexible
choices of models from the \emph{treatment efficient frontier}. We find maximum
a posteriori models using iterative discrete Monte Carlo steps in the joint
solution space of rules sets and parameters. To improve search efficiency, we
provide theoretically grounded heuristics and bounding strategies to prune and
confine the search space. Experiments show that the search algorithm can
efficiently recover true underlying subgroups. We apply CRS on public and
real-world datasets from domains where interpretability is indispensable. We
compare CRS with state-of-the-art rule-based subgroup discovery models. Results
show that CRS achieved consistently competitive performance on datasets from

column density ($\Sigma$) probability distribution function (PDF), while
self-gravitating clouds with active star formation develop a distinct power-law
tail at high column density. Although the growth of the power law can be
attributed to gravitational contraction leading to the formation of condensed
cores, it is often debated if an observed lognormal shape is a direct
consequence of supersonic turbulence alone, or even if it is really observed in
molecular clouds. In this paper we run three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulations including ambipolar diffusion with different initial conditions to
see the effect of strong magnetic fields and nonlinear initial velocity
perturbations on the evolution of the column density PDFs. Our simulations show
that column density PDFs of clouds with supercritical mass-to-flux ratio, with
either linear perturbations or nonlinear turbulence, quickly develop a
power-law tail such that $dN/d \log \Sigma \propto \Sigma^{-\alpha}$ with index
$\alpha \simeq 2$. Interestingly, clouds with subcritical mass-to-flux ratio
also proceed directly to a power-law PDF, but with a much steeper index $\alpha
\simeq 4$. This is a result of gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion.
However, for nonlinear perturbations with a turbulent spectrum ($v_{k}^{2}
\propto k^{-4}$), the column density PDFs of subcritical clouds do retain a
lognormal shape for a major part of the cloud evolution, and only develop a
distinct power-law tail with index $\alpha \simeq 2$ at greater column density

simultaneous screening of many biological characteristics a central problem in

identification from exposure patterns in health studies measuring baseline
confounders; moreover, doing so while avoiding model misspecification remains
an issue only partially addressed. Efficient estimators capable of
incorporating flexible, data adaptive regression techniques in estimating
relevant components of the data-generating distribution provide an avenue for
avoiding model misspecification; however, in the context of high-dimensional

standard variance estimators have proven unstable, resulting in unreliable
Type-I error control even under standard multiple testing corrections. We
present a general approach for applying empirical Bayes shrinkage to variance
estimators of a family of efficient, asymptotically linear estimators of
population intervention causal effects. Our generalization of shrinkage-based
variance estimators increases inferential stability in high-dimensional
settings, facilitating the application of these estimators for deriving
nonparametric variable importance measures in high-dimensional biological
datasets with modest sample sizes. The result is a data adaptive approach for
robustly uncovering stable causal associations in high-dimensional data in
studies with limited samples. Our generalized variance estimator is evaluated
against alternative variance estimators in numerical experiments.
Identification of biomarkers with the proposed methodology is demonstrated in

studies the suitability of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for overcoming

solid-fluid mixture theory is applied to study the poro-mechancial behavior of

mass, and energy are considered to describe deformation of the solid skeleton,
pore fluid pressure, and temperature distribution in the mixture. The
mechanical model assumes both linear elastic and viscoelastic isotropic
materials, infinitesimal strain theory, and a time-dependent response. The
influence of temperature on the mixture behavior is modeled through temperature
dependent mass density and volumetric thermal strain. The fluid flow through
the porous medium is described by the Darcy's law. The stress-strain relation
for time-dependent viscoelastic deformation in the solid skeleton is described
using the generalized Maxwell model. A verification example is presented to
illustrate accuracy and efficiency of the developed finite element model. The
influence of temperature is studied through examining the behavior of articular
cartilage for confined and unconfined boundary conditions. Furthermore,
articular cartilage under partial loading condition is modeled to investigate
the deformation, pore fluid pressure, and temperature dissipation processes.

this end, barrier certificates are employed for safe learning. The barrier
certificates establish a non-conservative forward invariant safe region, in
which high probability safety guarantees are provided based on the statistics

explore those uncertain states and expand the barrier certified safe region

calculation in numerical relativity. Recently more and more observations imply
that the Einstein equations should be modified with an nonzero cosmological
constant. In this work we use Bondi's original method to treat the Einstein

  Multiplication, with Applications",,,,,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$
many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$, and show that the
well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any
depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.
  Formally, for each depth $\Delta \leq \log d$, we show that any product-depth
$\Delta$ multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have size
$\exp(\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})).$ It also follows from this that any
multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ for the same polynomial of the
above form must have a size of $\exp(\Omega(d^{1/\Delta})).$ In particular, any
polynomial-sized multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth
$\Omega(\log d)$, and any polynomial-sized multilinear circuit for
$\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth $\Omega(\log d/\log \log d).$ Both these
bounds are tight up to constant factors.
  1. Depth-reduction: A well-known result of Brent (JACM 1974) implies that any
formula of size $s$ can be converted to one of size $s^{O(1)}$ and depth
$O(\log s)$; further, this reduction continues to hold for multilinear
formulas. Our lower bound implies that any depth-reduction in the multilinear
setting cannot reduce the depth to $o(\log s)$ without a superpolynomial
blow-up in size.
  2. Separations from general formulas: Our result, along with a non-trivial
upper bound for $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$ implied by a result of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal
and Saptharishi (SICOMP 2016), shows that for any size $s$ and product-depth
$\Delta = o(\log s),$ general formulas of size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta$
cannot be converted to multilinear formulas of size $s^{\omega(1)}$ and
product-depth $\Delta,$ when the underlying field has characteristic zero.

In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are
closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A_V$. We
define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes, termed $S_\mathrm{SED}$ and
$C_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming
sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from
$C_\mathrm{SED}$ with an accuracy of ~0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and
from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall,
but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A
novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties
simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and
quenching, exhibit ""mass-accelerated evolution"" (""downsizing""). A population of
transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These
objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ space
and have lower $A_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence.
Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two
regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming
galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.

solely on the minimization/maximization of the number of edges crossing the

minimization/maximization of the number of edges lying in the (two) sides of
the cut. In particular, Judicious Bipartition (JB) seeks a bipartition that is
""judicious"" in the sense that neither side is burdened by too many edges, and
Balanced JB also requires that the sizes of the sides themselves are ""balanced""

defined in the work by Bollob\'as and Scott, and have received notable
scientific attention since then. In this paper, we shed light on the study of
judicious partitioning problems from the viewpoint of algorithm design.

from the polyphasic sleep of infants to the single nighttime sleep period
typical in adults. Across this same developmental period, time scales of the
homeostatic sleep drive, the physiological drive to sleep that increases with
time spent awake, also change and presumably govern the transition from
polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. Using a physiologically-based,
sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep, we investigated the
dynamics of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep
during this transition by varying the homeostatic sleep drive time constants.
Previously, we introduced an algorithm for constructing a one-dimensional
circle map that represents the dynamics of the full sleep-wake network model.
By tracking bifurcations in the piecewise continuous circle map as the
homeostatic sleep drive time constants are varied, we establish evidence for a
border collision bifurcation that results in period-adding-like behavior in the
number of sleep cycles per day. Interestingly, this bifurcation is preceded by
bifurcations in the number of REM bouts per sleep cycle that exhibit truncated
period-adding-like behavior. The interaction of these bifurcations in numbers
of sleep episodes and numbers of REM bouts per sleep episode generate
non-monotonic variation in sleep cycle patterns as well as quasi-periodic
patterns during the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior.
This analysis may have implications for understanding changes in sleep in early
childhood when preschoolers transition from napping to non-napping behavior,
and the wide interindividual variation observed during this transition.

implemented on a custom-built temporal focusing fluorescence microscope (TFFM)
to enhance its axial resolution via a digital micromirror device (DMD). First,
the orientation of the modulated sinusoidal fringe patterns is automatically
identified via spatial frequency vector detection. Subsequently, the modulated
in-focal-plane images are obtained via rotation and subtraction. Lastly, a
parallel amplitude demodulation method, derived based on Hilbert transform, is
applied to complete the decoding processes. To demonstrate the new SLI
algorithm, a TFFM is custom-constructed, where a DMD replaces the generic
blazed grating in the system and simultaneously functions as a diffraction
grating and a programmable binary mask, generating arbitrary fringe patterns.
The experimental results show promising depth-discrimination capability with an
axial resolution enhancement factor of 1.25, which matches well with the
theoretical estimation, i.e, 1.27. Imaging experiments on pollen grain samples
have been performed. The results indicate that the two-snapshot algorithm
presents comparable contrast reconstruction and optical cross-sectioning
capability with those adopting the conventional root-mean-square (RMS)
reconstruction method. The two-snapshot method can be readily applied to any
sinusoidally modulated illumination systems to realize high-speed 3D imaging as
less frames are required for each in-focal-plane image restoration, i.e., the
image acquisition speed is improved by 2.5 times for any two-photon systems.

moment-based approximation of a model kinetic equation in one dimension. This
approximation is equivalent to a standard spectral method in the velocity
variable of the kinetic distribution and, as such, is accompanied by standard
algebraic estimates of the form $N^{-q}$, where $N$ is the number of modes and
$q>0$ depends on the regularity of the solution. However, in the multiscale
setting, the error estimate can be expressed in terms of the scaling parameter
$\epsilon$, which measures the ratio of the mean-free-path to the
characteristic domain length. We show that, for isotropic initial conditions,
the error in the spectral approximation is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{N+1})$. More
surprisingly, the coefficients of the expansion satisfy super convergence
properties. In particular, the error of the $\ell^{th}$ coefficient of the
expansion scales like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2N})$ when $\ell =0$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2N+2-\ell})$ for all $1\leq \ell \leq N$. This result is
significant, because the low-order coefficients correspond to physically
relevant quantities of the underlying system. All the above estimates involve
constants depending on $N$, the time $t$, and the initial condition. We
investigate specifically the dependence on $N$, in order to assess whether
increasing $N$ actually yields an additional factor of $\epsilon$ in the error.
Numerical tests will also be presented to support the theoretical results.

investigated by measuring their in-flight decay products,
$^{28}$S+proton+proton and $^{28}$S+proton, respectively. A refined analysis of
$^{28}$S-proton angular correlations indicates that the ground state of
$^{30}$Ar is located at $2.45^{+0.05}_{-0.10}$ MeV above the two-proton
emission threshold. The theoretical investigation of the $^{30}$Ar ground state
decay demonstrates that its mechanism has the transition dynamics with a
surprisingly strong sensitivity of the correlation patterns of the decay
products to the two-proton decay energy of the $^{30}$Ar ground state and the
one-proton decay energy as well as the one-proton decay width of the $^{29}$Cl
ground state. The comparison of the experimental $^{28}$S-proton angular
correlations with those resulting from Monte Carlo simulations of the detector
response illustrates that other observed $^{30}$Ar excited states decay by
sequential emission of protons via intermediate resonances in $^{29}$Cl. Based
on the findings, the decay schemes of the observed states in $^{30}$Ar and
$^{29}$Cl were constructed. For calibration purposes and for checking the
performance of the experimental setup, decays of the previously-known states of
a two-proton emitter $^{19}$Mg were remeasured. Evidences for one new excited
state in $^{19}$Mg and two unknown states in $^{18}$Na were found.

which leverages on inertial fusion and kernel cross-correlators (KCC) to match
point clouds in frequency domain. Dominated by the fast Fourier transform
(FFT), our method is only of complexity $\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$, where $n$ is
the number of points. Map fusion is conducted by element-wise operations, so
that both time and space complexity are further reduced. Extensive experiments
show that, due to the lightweight of the proposed front-end, the framework is
able to run at a much faster speed yet still with comparable accuracy with the

learning, we consider stochastic quasi-Newton (SQN) methods for solving
unconstrained convex optimization problems. The convergence analysis of the SQN
methods, both full and limited-memory variants, require the objective function
to be strongly convex. However, this assumption is fairly restrictive and does
not hold for applications such as minimizing the logistic regression loss
function. To the best of our knowledge, no rate statements currently exist for
SQN methods in the absence of such an assumption. Also, among the existing
first-order methods for addressing stochastic optimization problems with merely
convex objectives, those equipped with provable convergence rates employ
averaging. However, this averaging technique has a detrimental impact on
inducing sparsity. Motivated by these gaps, the main contributions of the paper
are as follows: (i) Addressing large scale stochastic optimization problems, we
develop an iteratively regularized stochastic limited-memory BFGS (IRS-LBFGS)
algorithm, where the stepsize, regularization parameter, and the Hessian
inverse approximation matrix are updated iteratively. We establish the
convergence to an optimal solution of the original problem both in an
almost-sure and mean senses. We derive the convergence rate in terms of the
objective function's values and show that it is of the order
$\mathcal{O}\left(k^{-\left(\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon\right)}\right)$, where
$\epsilon$ is an arbitrary small positive scalar; (ii) In deterministic regime,
we show that the regularized limited-memory BFGS algorithm displays a rate of
the order $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{k^{1 -\epsilon'}}\right)$, where
$\epsilon'$ is an arbitrary small positive scalar. We present our numerical
experiments performed on a large scale text classification problem.

touch sensing for grasp outcome prediction, we must understand how touch
sensing can influence outcome prediction accuracy when combined with other
modalities. Doing so using conventional model-based techniques is exceptionally
difficult. In this work, we investigate the question of whether touch sensing
aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing framework that
combines vision and touch. To that end, we collected more than 9,000 grasping
trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution
tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network

using the Fermi-LAT, and it can be explained by particle acceleration at shocks
in these systems. Eight out of these nine objects are classical novae in which
interaction of the ejecta with a tenuous circumbinary material is not expected
to generate detectable gamma-ray emission. We examine whether particle
acceleration at internal shocks can account for the gamma-ray emission from
these novae. The shocks result from the interaction of a fast wind
radiatively-driven by nuclear burning on the white dwarf with material ejected
in the initial runaway stage of the nova outburst. We present a one-dimensional
model for the dynamics of a forward and reverse shock system in a nova ejecta,
and for the associated time-dependent particle acceleration and high-energy
gamma-ray emission. Non-thermal proton and electron spectra are calculated by
solving a time-dependent transport equation for particle injection,
acceleration, losses, and escape from the shock region. The predicted emission
is compared to LAT observations of V407 Cyg, V1324 Sco, V959 Mon, V339 Del,
V1369 Cen, and V5668 Sgr. The 100MeV gamma-ray emission arises predominantly
from particles accelerated up to ~100GeV at the reverse shock and undergoing
hadronic interactions in the dense cooling layer downstream of the shock. The
internal shock model can account for the gamma-ray emission of the novae
detected by Fermi-LAT, including the main features in the observations of the
recent gamma-ray nova ASASSN-16ma. Gamma-ray observations hold potential for
probing the mechanism of mass ejection in novae, but should be combined to
diagnostics of the thermal emission at lower energies to be more constraining.

distribution where a nearby source is solely responsible for the anisotropies
in arrival directions of cosmic rays while the rest of the sources contribute
only isotropically. An analytical approach focused on large-scale anisotropies,
which are influenced by deflections in a Kolmogorov-type turbulent magnetic
field, is employed to provide more general results. When the recent Pierre
Auger Observatory angular power spectrum above 8 EeV is used the restricted
model gives, under the assumption of the small angle approximation, a solution
where the RMS deflection with respect to the line of sight is $\alpha_{\rm rms}
= \left(50^{+11}_{-10}\right)^\circ$, while the relative flux from the single
source $\eta=0.03\pm 0.01$. Furthermore, the solution can be translated into
constraints on the source distance, luminosity, and extra-galactic magnetic
field strength. For Centaurus A and the Virgo cluster the required relation
between the coherence length and the RMS magnetic field strength is obtained: a
coherence length of $~\sim 100\,\mathrm{kpc}$ would imply the RMS field
strength around $1\,\mathrm{nG}$ for iron dominated and above $10\,\mathrm{nG}$
for proton dominated composition. We also performed trajectory simulations with
our publicly available code CRPropa to show that our analytical model can serve
as a good approximation as long as the deflections in cosmic magnetic fields
can be described as a random walk. The simulations showed that generally
structured fields tend to suppress large-scale anisotropies, especially the
dipole, compared to anisotropies at smaller scales described by higher
multipoles.

  Convolutional Neural Network","9pages, 1 figures",,,,"cs.LG cond-mat.str-el cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in computer vision
especially image classification problems requests a new information theory for
function of image, instead of image itself. In this article, after establishing
a deep mathematical connection between image classification problem and quantum
spin model, we propose to use entanglement entropy, a generalization of
classical Boltzmann-Shannon entropy, as a powerful tool to characterize the
information needed for representation of general function of image. We prove
that there is a sub-volume-law bound for entanglement entropy of target
functions of reasonable image classification problems. Therefore target
functions of image classification only occupy a small subspace of the whole
Hilbert space. As a result, a neural network with polynomial number of
parameters is efficient for representation of such target functions of image.
The concept of entanglement entropy can also be useful to characterize the
expressive power of different neural networks. For example, we show that to
maintain the same expressive power, number of channels $D$ in a convolutional
neural network should scale with the number of convolution layers $n_c$ as
$D\sim D_0^{\frac{1}{n_c}}$. Therefore, deeper CNN with large $n_c$ is more
efficient than shallow ones.

photoemission spectroscopy, magnetotransport and calorimetric measurements. At
elevated temperatures where $4f$-electrons are localized, there are triply
degenerate points, yielding Weyl nodes in applied magnetic fields. These are
revealed by a contribution from the chiral anomaly in the magnetotransport,
which at low temperatures becomes negligible due to the influence of electronic
correlations. Instead, Weyl fermions are inferred from the topological Hall
effect, which provides evidence for a Berry curvature, and a cubic temperature
dependence of the specific heat, as expected from the linear dispersion near
the Weyl nodes. The results suggest that YbPtBi is a Weyl heavy fermion
semimetal, where the Kondo interaction renormalizes the bands hosting Weyl
points. These findings open up an opportunity to explore the interplay between
topology and strong electronic correlations.

mechanisms to protect location privacy during the use of LBSs. Nowadays, the
most popular methods are probabilistic, and the so-called optimal method
achieves an optimal trade-off between privacy and utility by using linear
optimization techniques. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of linear

new direction in anti-censorship research. Decoy Routers (DRs), placed in
Autonomous Systems, proxy traffic from users; so the adversary, e.g., a
censorious government, attempts to avoid them. It is quite difficult to place
DRs so the adversary cannot route around them for example, we need the
cooperation of 850 ASes to contain China alone. In this paper, we consider a
different approach. We begin by noting that DRs need not intercept all the
network paths from a country, just those leading to Overt Destinations, i.e.,
unfiltered websites hosted outside the country (usually popular ones, so that
client traffic to the OD does not make the censor suspicious. Our first
question is; How many ASes are required for installing DRs to intercept a large
fraction of paths from, e.g., China to the top n websites (as per Alexa)? How
does this number grow with n? Few ASes (approx. 30) intercept over 90% of paths
to the top n sites, for n = 10, 20...200. Our first contribution is to
demonstrate with real paths that the number of ASes required for a world-wide
DR framework is small (approx. 30). Further, censor nations attempts to filter
traffic along the paths transiting these 30 ASes will not only block their own
citizens, but others residing in foreign ASes. Our second contribution in this
paper is to consider the details of DR placement: not just in which ASes DRs
should be placed to intercept traffic, but exactly where in each AS. We find
that even with our small number of ASes, we still need a total of about 11,700
DRs.We conclude that, even though a DR system involves far fewer ASes than
previously thought, it is still a major undertaking. For example, the current
routers cost over 10.3 billion USD, so if DR at line speed requires all new
hardware, the cost alone would make such a project unfeasible for most actors.

so far. In this paper we reproduce for the first time these line features with
two different physically motivated kinematic models: an interstellar medium
composed by outflowing clumps with random motions and an homogeneous gaseous

mode has, however, been designed to probe mainly a bino-like DM, originating in
the decays of a pair of next-to-lightest neutralino and lightest chargino, both
of which are assumed to be wino-like. In this study, we analyse how this
trilepton channel can be tuned for probing also the wino-like DM. We note that,
while the mentioned standard production mode generally leads to a relatively
poor sensitivity for the wino-like DM, there are regions in the MSSM parameter
space where the net yield in the trilepton final state can be substantially
enhanced at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. This is achieved by taking into
account also an alternative channel, pair-production of the wino-like DM itself
in association with the heavier chargino, and optimisation of the kinematical
cuts currently employed by the LHC collaborations. In particular, we find that
the cut on the transverse mass of the third lepton highly suppresses both the
signal channels and should therefore be discarded in this DM scenario. We
perform a detailed detector-level study of some selected parameter space points
that are consistent with the most important experimental constraints, including
the recent ones from the direct and indirect DM detection facilities. Our
analysis demonstrates the high complementarity of the two channels, with their
combined significance reaching above 4$\sigma$ for a wino-like DM mass around

We show such examples naturally appear in a toric Fano manifold. Moreover, we
consider the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow in a Fano manifold
which is introduced by Behrndt and Smoczyk-Wang. We generalize the result of H.
Li, and show that if the initial Lagrangian submanifold is a small Hamiltonian
deformation of an $f$-minimal and Hamiltonian $f$-stable Lagrangian
submanifold, then the generalized MCF converges exponentially fast to an

be something called modes. Particles are interpreted as composites of modes,
corresponding to eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian of modes. At the
fundamental level of the proposed theory, there are two basic modes only,whose
spinor spaces are the two smallest nontrivial representation spaces of the
SL(2,C) group, one being the complex conjugate of the other. All other modes
are constructed from the two basic modes, making use of the operations of
direct sum and direct product for related spinor spaces. Accompanying the
construction of direct-product modes, interactions among modes are introduced
in a natural way, with the interaction Hamiltonian given from mappings between
the corresponding state spaces. The interaction Hamiltonian thus obtained turn
out to possess a form, which is similar to a major part of the interaction
Hamiltonian in the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam electroweak theory. In the proposed
theory, it is possible for the second-order perturbation expansion of energy to
be free from ultraviolet divergence. This expansion is used to derive some
approximate relations for neutrino masses; in particular, a rough estimate is
obtained for the ratio of mass differences of neutrinos, which gives the
correct order of magnitude compared with the experimental result.

as far out in SiO J=2-1 as in CO J = 1-0 and CO J = 2-1, in dramatic contrast
with the centrally condensed (thermal) SiO- but extended CO-emitting envelopes
of giant and supergiant stars. Here, we present an observation of the
circumstellar envelope in SiO J=1-0 that, when combined with the previous
observation in {\sioii}, provide more stringent constraints on the density of
the SiO-emitting gas than hitherto possible. The emission in SiO peaks at a
radius of $\sim$2\arcsec\ whereas that in SiO J=2-1 emission peaks at a smaller
radius of $\sim$1\arcsec, giving rise to their ring-like appearances. The ratio
in brightness temperature between SiO J=1-0 and SiO J=2-1 decreases from a
value well above unity at the innermost measurable radius to about unity at
radius of $\sim$2\arcsec, beyond which this ratio remains approximately
constant. Dividing the envelope into three zones as in models for the CO J =
1-0 and CO J = 2-1 emission, we show that the density of the SiO-emitting gas
is comparable with that of the CO-emitting gas in the inner zone, but at least
an order of magnitude higher by comparison in both the middle and outer zones.
The SiO-emitting gas therefore originates from dense clumps, likely associated
with the dust clumps seen in scattered optical light, surrounded by more
diffuse CO-emitting interclump gas. We suggest that SiO molecules are released
from dust grains due to shock interactions between the dense SiO-emitting
clumps and the diffuse CO-emitting interclump gas.

appear to be single. We inspect four apparently single CEMP-s stars and discuss
the possibility that they formed from the ejecta of a previous-generation

pairing in diverse classes of materials and in a variety of artificial

manipulate the topological behavior of $p$-wave superconductors (PSCs) that
could open perspectives for applications. Such a control knob is naturally
provided by the spin-triplet character of the PSC order parameter, described by
the spin d-vector. Therefore, in this work we investigate the magnetic field
response of one-dimensional (1d) PSCs and demonstrate that the structure of the
Cooper pair spin-configuration is crucial to set topological phases with an
enhanced number of Majorana fermions per edge, N, ranging from N=0 to 4. The
topological phase diagram, consisting of phases with Majorana modes at the
edge, becomes significantly modified when one tunes the strength of the applied
field and allows for long range hopping amplitudes in the 1d PSC. We find
transitions between phases with different number of Majorana fermions per edge
that can be both induced by a variation of the hopping strength and a spin
rotation of the d-vector. Hence, the interplay of the applied magnetic field
and the internal spin degree of freedom of the PSC opens a new promising route
for engineering topological phases with large number of Majorana modes.

gradient of the velocity (the strain tensor) in the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, and proves the existence of $L^2$
mild solutions to this equation. We use this equation to obtain a simplified
identity for the growth of enstrophy for mild solutions that depends only on
the strain tensor, not on the nonlocal interaction of the strain tensor with
the vorticity. The resulting identity allows us to prove a new family of
scale-critical, necessary and sufficient conditions for the blow-up of a
solution at some finite time $T_{max}<+\infty$, which depend only on the
history of the positive part of the second eigenvalue of the strain matrix.
Since this matrix is trace-free, this severely restricts the geometry of any
finite-time blow-up. This regularity criterion provides analytic evidence of
the numerically observed tendency of the vorticity to align with the
eigenvector corresponding to the middle eigenvalue of the strain matrix. This
regularity criterion also allows us to prove as a corollary a new scale
critical, one component type, regularity criterion for a range of exponents for
which there were previously no known critical, one component type regularity
criteria. Furthermore, our analysis permits us to extend the known time of
existence of smooth solutions with fixed initial enstrophy
$E_0=\frac{1}{2}\left\|\nabla \otimes u^0\right \|_{L^2}^2$ by a factor of
$4{,}920{.}75$---although the previous constant in the literature was not
expected to be close to optimal, so this improvement is less drastic than it
sounds, especially compared with numerical results. Finally, we will prove the
existence and stability of blow-up for a toy model ODE for the strain equation.

  We present novel fair regression and dimensionality reduction methods built
on a previously proposed fair classification framework. Both methods rely on
using the Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion as the fairness term. Unlike
previous approaches, this allows us to simplify the problem and to use multiple
sensitive variables simultaneously. Replacing the linear formulation by kernel
functions allows the methods to deal with nonlinear problems. For both linear
and nonlinear formulations the solution reduces to solving simple matrix
inversions or generalized eigenvalue problems. This simplifies the evaluation
of the solutions for different trade-off values between the predictive error
and fairness terms. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in toy
examples, and evaluate their performance on real world datasets to predict
income using gender and/or race discrimination as sensitive variables, and
contraceptive method prediction under demographic and socio-economic sensitive
descriptors.

finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) of interconnected discrete-time
control systems. The compositional scheme is based on the joint
dissipativity-type properties of discrete-time control subsystems and their
finite abstractions. In the first part of the paper, we use a notion of
so-called storage function as a relation between each subsystem and its finite
abstraction to construct compositionally a notion of so-called simulation
function as a relation between interconnected finite abstractions and that of
control systems. The derived simulation function is used to quantify the error
between the output behavior of the overall interconnected concrete system and
that of its finite abstraction. In the second part of the paper, we propose a
technique to construct finite abstractions together with their corresponding
storage functions for a class of discrete-time control systems under some
incremental passivity property. We show that if a discrete-time control system
is so-called incrementally passivable, then one can construct its finite
abstraction by a suitable quantization of the input and state sets together
with the corresponding storage function. Finally, the proposed results are
illustrated by constructing a finite abstraction of a network of linear
discrete-time control systems and its corresponding simulation function in a
compositional way. The compositional conditions in this example do not impose
any restriction on the gains or the number of the subsystems which, in

discs in the Lupus, Chamaeleon and signa Orionis star forming regions, observed
with the X-shooter spectrograph at VLT. The stars have mass accretion rates
spanning from 10^{-12} to 10^{-7} Mo/yr. The line profile was deconvolved into
a low velocity component (LVC, < 40 km/s) and a high velocity component (HVC, >
40 km/s ), originating from slow winds and high velocity jets, respectively.
The LVC is by far the most frequent component, with a detection rate of 77%,
while only 30% of sources have a HVC. The [OI]6300 luminosity of both the LVC
and HVC, when detected, correlates with stellar and accretion parameters of the
central sources (i.e. Lstar , Mstar , Lacc , Macc), with similar slopes for the
two components. The line luminosity correlates better with the accretion
luminosity than with the stellar luminosity or stellar mass. We suggest that
accretion is the main drivers for the line excitation and that MHD disc-winds
are at the origin of both components. In the sub-sample of Lupus sources
observed with ALMA a relationship is found between the HVC peak velocity and
the outer disc inclination angle, as expected if the HVC traces jets ejected
perpendicularly to the disc plane. Mass loss rates measured from the HVC span
from ~ 10^{-13} to ~10^{-7} Mo/yr. The corresponding Mloss/Macc ratio ranges
from ~0.01 to ~0.5, with an average value of 0.07. However, considering the
upper limits on the HVC, we infer a ratio < 0.03 in more than 40% of sources.
We argue that most of these sources might lack the physical conditions needed
for an efficient magneto-centrifugal acceleration in the star-disc interaction
region. Systematic observations of populations of younger stars, that is, class
0/I, are needed to explore how the frequency and role of jets evolve during the
pre-main sequence phase.

obtained thanks to numerous modeling efforts and analytical and numerical
studies, considering host populations with very different structures and
properties, including complex and temporal interaction networks. Moreover, a
number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence
of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts
on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been
proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that
decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks.
Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks
of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical
and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical
time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold
is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly
decreased. Numerical studies highlight however the presence of very strong
finite-size effects, in particular for the more realistic synthetic temporal
networks, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold
in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the
awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to
a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.

localization features a series of critical values of the force-to-disorder
strength where the m-th position moment of the wave packet diverges. Below the
critical value for the m-th moment, we find fair agreement between the
asymptotic long-time value of the m-th moment and the predictions of
diagrammatic calculations. Above it, we find that the m-th moment grows
algebraically in time. For correlated disorder, we find evidence of systematic
delocalization, irrespective to the model of disorder. More precisely, we find
a two-step dynamics, where both the center-of-mass position and the width of
the wave packet show transient localization, similar to the white-noise case,

of helium, around 10 or 15~\%, may reduce drastically the transverse diffusion
down to 2.5~mm/$\sqrt{\mathrm{m}}$ from the 10.5~mm/$\sqrt{\mathrm{m}}$ of pure

Light production studies have been performed as well. They show that the
relative variation in energy resolution introduced by such a change does not
exceed a few percent, which leaves the energy resolution practically unchanged.
The technical caveats of using photomultipliers close to an helium atmosphere

often appear naturally in the communications setting. However, as the involved
communication devices often exhibit a modest computational power, the
complexity of the codes to be utilised should be reasonably low for possible
practical implementation.
  Fast-decodable codes enjoy reduced complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML)
decoding due to a smart inner structure allowing for parallelisation in the ML
search. The complexity reductions considered in this chapter are entirely owing
to the algebraic structure of the considered codes, and could be further
improved by employing non-ML decoding methods, however yielding suboptimal
performance.
  The aim of this chapter is twofold. First, we provide a tutorial introduction
to space--time coding and study powerful algebraic tools for their design and

worst-case decoding complexity of both single-user and multiuser space-time

While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open
question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians
perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations
in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without
metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of
cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat
interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated
processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One
process dominates on short timescales ($t < 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming
variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer
timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show
differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short
timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz
makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop.
Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire
algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming
fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between
minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.

attention in recent years. Particular attention has been paid to Bayesian
inverse problems (BIPs) in which the parameter to be inferred lies in an
infinite-dimensional space, a typical example being a scalar or tensor field
coupled to some observed data via an ODE or PDE. This article gives an
introduction to the framework of well-posed BIPs in infinite-dimensional
parameter spaces, as advocated by Stuart (Acta Numer. 19:451--559, 2010) and
others. This framework has the advantage of ensuring uniformly well-posed
inference problems independently of the finite-dimensional discretisation used
for numerical solution. Recently, this framework has been extended to the case
of a heavy-tailed prior measure in the family of stable distributions, such as
an infinite-dimensional Cauchy distribution, for which polynomial moments are
infinite or undefined. It is shown that analogues of the Karhunen--Lo\`eve
expansion for square-integrable random variables can be used to sample such
measures on quasi-Banach spaces. Furthermore, under weaker regularity
assumptions than those used to date, the Bayesian posterior measure is shown to
depend Lipschitz continuously in the Hellinger and total variation metrics upon
perturbations of the misfit function and observed data.

due to frequent storage node failures. This paper shows that properly designed
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can substantially reduce the amount of
required block downloads for repair thanks to the sparse nature of their factor
graph representation. In particular, with a careful construction of the factor
graph, both low repair-bandwidth and high reliability can be achieved for a
given code rate. First, a formula for the average repair bandwidth of LDPC
codes is developed. This formula is then used to establish that the minimum
repair bandwidth can be achieved by forcing a regular check node degree in the
factor graph. Moreover, it is shown that given a fixed code rate, the variable
node degree should also be regular to yield minimum repair bandwidth, under
some reasonable minimum variable node degree constraint. It is also shown that
for a given repair-bandwidth requirement, LDPC codes can yield substantially
higher reliability than currently utilized Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Our
reliability analysis is based on a formulation of the general equation for the
mean-time-to-data-loss (MTTDL) associated with LDPC codes. The formulation
reveals that the stopping number is closely related to the MTTDL. It is further
shown that LDPC codes can be designed such that a small loss of
repair-bandwidth optimality may be traded for a large improvement in
erasure-correction capability and thus the MTTDL.

consideration. We prove both min-max and min-sum problems are NP-complete in
general. When dispatching UAVs from the same location, we present an optimal
algorithm of low computational complexity $O(n^2)$ for the min-max problem.
When UAVs are dispatched from different locations, we propose to preserve their
location order during deployment and successfully design a fully polynomial
time approximation scheme (FPTAS) of computation complexity $O(n^2 \log
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ to arbitrarily approach the global optimum with relative
error $\epsilon$. The min-sum problem is more challenging. When UAVs are
dispatched from the same initial location, we present an approximation
algorithm of linear time. As for the general case, we further reformulate it as
a dynamic program and propose a pseudo polynomial-time algorithm to solve it
optimally.

the UHECR is found to have a pronounced dipolar anisotropy and rather weak
higher-order contributions to the angular power spectrum. This finding agrees
well with the recent observation of a dipolar anisotropy for UHECR with arrival
energies above 8 EeV by the Pierre Auger Observatory and constitutes an
important prediction for other energy ranges and higher-order angular
contributions for which sufficient experimental data are not yet available.
Since our astrophysical scenario enables simulations that are completely
consistent with the available data, this scenario will be a very useful basis

the `Yonetoku correlation', assuming a standard delay distribution between the
cosmic star formation rate and the production rate of their progenitors. While
the simple powerlaw is ruled out to high confidence, the data is fit well both
by exponential cutoff powerlaw and broken powerlaw models. Using the derived

angles seen from afterglow observations, the true rate of short GRBs are

derived for the past, present and future configurations of the GW detector

range to study the single-pulse emission properties of the mode-switching
pulsar B0943+10. We review the derivation of magnetospheric geometry,
originally based on low-frequency radio data, and show that the geometry is
less constrained than previously thought. This may be used to help explain the
large fractional amplitudes of the observed thermal X-ray pulsations from the
polar cap, which contradict the almost aligned rotator model of PSR B0943+10.
We analyse the properties of drifting subpulses in the Bright mode and report
on the minutes-long variations of the drift period. We searched for the
periodic amplitude modulation of drifting subpulses, which is a vital argument
for constraining several important system parameters: the degree of aliasing,
the orientation of the line-of-sight vector with respect to magnetic and spin
axes, the angular velocity of the carousel, and thus, the gradient of the
accelerating potential in the polar gap. The periodic amplitude modulation was
not detected, indicating that it may be a rare or narrow-band phenomenon. Based
on our non-detection and review of available literature, we chose to leave the
aliasing order unconstrained and derived the number of sparks under different
assumptions about the aliasing order and geometry angles. Contrary to the
previous findings, we did not find a large (of the order of 10%) gradual
variation of the separation between subpulses throughout Bright mode. We
speculate that this large variation may be due to the incorrect accounting for
the curvature of the line of sight within the on-pulse window. Finally, we
report on the frequency-dependent drift phase delay, which is similar to the
delay reported previously for PSR B0809+74. We provide a quantitative
explanation of the observed frequency-dependent drift phase delay within the

activity through magnetic induction. In the present work we demonstrate that
action potentials from crayfish lateral giant neuron can trigger microwave
oscillations in spin-torque nano-oscillators. These nanoscale devices take as
input small currents and convert them to microwave current oscillations that
can wirelessly broadcast neuronal activity, opening up the possibility for
compact neuro-sensors. We show that action potentials activate microwave
oscillations in spin-torque nano-oscillators with an amplitude that follows the
action potential signal, demonstrating that the device has both the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to respond to action potentials from a single neuron.
The activation of magnetic oscillations by action potentials, together with the
small footprint and the high frequency tunability, makes these devices
promising candidates for high resolution sensing of bioelectric signals from

networks and the associated ecosystems through the integration of cross-domain
networks. Network slicing is an enabling technology for 5G as it provides
dynamic, on-demand, and reliable logical network slices (i.e., network
services) over a common physical network/infrastructure. Since a network slice
is subject to failures originated from disruptions, namely node or link
failures, in the physical infrastructure, our utmost interest is to evaluate
the reliability of a network slice before assigning it to customers. In this
paper, we propose an evaluation metric, \textit{survivable probability}, to
quantify the reliability of a network slice under random physical link
failure(s). We prove the existence of a \textit{base protecting spanning tree
set} which has the same survivable probability as that of a network slice. We
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions to identify a base protecting
spanning tree set and develop corresponding mathematical formulations, which
can be used to generate reliable network slices in the 5G environment. In
addition to proving the viability of our approaches with simulation results, we
also discuss how our problems and approaches are related to the Steiner tree

lattice QCD calculations of few baryons systems. However, these calculations
suffer from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem which has prevented a
controlled extrapolation to the physical point. The variational method has been
applied very successfully to two-meson systems, allowing for the extraction of
the two-meson states very early in Euclidean time through the use of improved
single hadron operators. The sheer numerical cost of using the same techniques
in two-baryon systems has been prohibitive. We present an alternate strategy
which offers some of the same advantages as the variational method while being
significantly less numerically expensive. We first use the Matrix Prony method
to form an optimal linear combination of single baryon interpolating fields
generated from the same source and different sink interpolators. Very early in
Euclidean time this linear combination is numerically free of excited state
contamination, so we coin it a calm baryon. This calm baryon operator is then
used in the construction of the two-baryon correlation functions.
  To test this method, we perform calculations on the WM/JLab iso-clover gauge
configurations at the SU(3) flavor symmetric point with m{\pi} $\sim$ 800 MeV
--- the same configurations we have previously used for the calculation of
two-nucleon correlation functions. We observe the calm baryon removes the
excited state contamination from the two-nucleon correlation function to as
early a time as the single-nucleon is improved, provided non-local (displaced
nucleon) sources are used. For the local two-nucleon correlation function
(where both nucleons are created from the same space-time location) there is
still improvement, but there is significant excited state contamination in the
region the single calm baryon displays no excited state contamination.

the question as to whether or not other classical schemes may be generalized to
arbitrary groups and whether classical results still apply to those generalized
schemes. In this thesis, we generalize the Even-Mansour cipher and the Feistel

obtained on a one-key, group variant of the Even-Mansour cipher. We generalize
the result by Kilian and Rogaway, that the Even-Mansour cipher is pseudorandom,
to super pseudorandomness, also in the one-key, group case. Using a Slide
Attack we match the bound found above. After generalizing the Feistel cipher to
arbitrary groups we resolve an open problem of Patel, Ramzan, and Sundaram by
showing that the 3-round Feistel cipher over an arbitrary group is not super
pseudorandom. We generalize a result by Gentry and Ramzan showing that the
Even-Mansour cipher can be implemented using the Feistel cipher as the public
permutation. In this result, we also consider the one-key case over a group and
generalize their bound. Finally, we consider Zhandry's result on quantum

supposed that the system state is governed by the quantum master equation
(QME). We investigated the quantum pump and the excess entropy production. In
the first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full
counting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the
latter part of the thesis, we investigated the excess entropy production. The
average entropy production is composed of the time integral of the
instantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess entropy production.
We define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle
currents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME.
The excess entropy production is given by a line integral in the control
parameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN)
vector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is
described by $\ln \rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\rho_0$ where $\rho_0$ is the
instantaneous steady state of the QME and $\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME
which is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term. In general, the
potential dose not exist. The origins of the non-existence of the potential are
a quantum effect (the Lamb shift) and the breaking of the time-reversal
symmetry. The non-existence of the potential means that the excess entropy
essentially depends on the path of the modulation. If the system Hamiltonian is
non-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the excess entropy
production approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann
entropies of the system. We pointed out that the expression of the entropy
production obtained in the classical Markov jump process is different from our
result and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in the weakly
nonequilibrium regime.

momentum is efficiently transferred from the core to the envelope inside red
giants, but the physical mechanisms at work are not yet fully understood. We
thus need stronger observational constraints on the evolution of the red giant
core rotation. In this context, we developed an automated method to determine
the mean core rotation of red giant branch stars observed with Kepler. This
automated method is paving the way for the future PLATO data, representing
hundreds of thousands of potential red giant oscillation spectra. Results
obtained for almost 1200 red giant branch stars indicate that the rate of the
core rotation braking is lower than previously estimated and does not seem to

are aggregated to output the relevance label. In this paper we propose a new

integration and term gating mechanism is used to produce a global relevance
score. DeepRank well captures important IR characteristics, including
exact/semantic matching signals, proximity heuristics, query term importance,

of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. In this paper, we extend the existing
distributed calibration algorithms to use ADMM with an adaptive penalty
parameter update. Compared to a fixed penalty, its adaptive update has been
shown to perform better in diverse applications of ADMM. In this paper, we
compare two such popular penalty parameter update schemes: residual balance
penalty update and spectral penalty update (Barzilai-Borwein). We apply both
schemes to distributed radio interferometric calibration and compare their
performance against ADMM with a fixed penalty parameter. Simulations show that
both methods of adaptive penalty update improve the convergence of ADMM but the

  We also study the torsion in homology of the uniform random $\Q$-acyclic

its heading based on the current positions and headings of its neighbors.
Several authors have investigated the effects of including anticipation into
models of this type, and have found that anticipation inhibits polarized
collective motion in alignment based models and promotes milling and swarming
in the one attraction-repulsion model studied. However, it was recently
reported that polarized collective motion does emerge in an alignment based
asynchronous lattice model with mutual anticipation. To our knowledge this is
the only reported case where polarized collective motion has been observed in a
model with anticipation. Here we show that including anticipation induces
polarized collective motion in a synchronous, off lattice, attraction based
model. This establishes that neither asynchrony, mutual anticipation nor motion
restricted to a lattice environment are strict requirements for anticipation to
promote polarized collective motion. In addition, unlike alignment based models
the attraction based model used here does not produce any type of polarized
collective motion in the absence of anticipation. Here anticipation is a direct
polarization inducing mechanism. We believe that utilizing anticipation instead
of frequently used alternatives such as explicit alignment terms, asynchronous
updates and asymmetric interactions to generate polarized collective motion may
be advantageous in some cases.

Defined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the
control plane and data plane. Network monitoring in SDN is lightweight as
operators only need to install a monitoring module into the controller. Active
monitoring techniques usually introduce too many overheads into the network.
The state-of-the-art approaches utilize sampling method, aggregation flow
statistics and passive measurement techniques to reduce overheads. However,
little work in literature has focus on reducing the communication cost of
network monitoring. Moreover, most of the existing approaches select the
polling switch nodes by sub-optimal local heuristics. Inspired by the
visibility and central control of SDN, we propose FlowCover, a low-cost
high-accuracy monitoring scheme to support various network management tasks. We
leverage the global view of the network topology and active flows to minimize
the communication cost by formulating the problem as a weighted set cover,
which is proved to be NP-hard. Heuristics are presented to obtain the polling
scheme efficiently and handle flow changes practically. We build a simulator to

facilitate quality of service routing and performance evaluation. Software
Defined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the
control plane and data plane. Network monitoring in SDN is relatively
light-weight since operators only need to install a monitoring module into the
controller. Active monitoring techniques usually introduce extra overhead into
the network. The state-of-the-art approaches utilize sampling, aggregation and
passive measurement techniques to reduce measurement overhead. However, little
work has focused on reducing the communication cost of network monitoring.
Moreover, most of the existing approaches select polling switch nodes by
sub-optimal local heuristics.Inspired by the visibility and central control of
SDN, we propose CeMon, a generic low-cost high-accuracy monitoring system that
supports various network management tasks. We first propose a Maximum Coverage
Polling Scheme (MCPS) to optimize the polling cost for all active flows. The
problem is formulated as a weighted set cover problem which is proved to be
NP-hard. Heuristics are presented to obtain the polling scheme efficiently and
handle traffic dynamics practically. In order to balance the cost and
flexibility, an Adaptive Fine-grained Polling Scheme (AFPS) is proposed as a
complementary method to implement flow level measurement tasks. Three sampling
algorithms are further proposed to eliminate measurement overhead while
maintain high accuracy. Both emulation and simulation results show that MCPS
reduces more than 50% of the communication cost with negligible loss of
accuracy for different topologies and traffics. We also use real traces to
demonstrate that AFPS reduces the cost by up to 20% with only 1.5% loss in
accuracy.

common approach to estimate the basic properties of molecular clouds, such as
total mass and column density of molecular hydrogen, from (sub)mm continuum
observations of the dust. In the Milky Way a single value is used at all
galactocentric radii, independently of the observed metallicity gradients. Both
models and extragalactic observations suggest that this quantity increases for
decreasing metallicity Z, typical of the outer regions in disks, where fewer
heavy elements are available to form dust grains.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the variation of the gas-to-dust ratio as a
function of galactocentric radius and metallicity, to allow a more accurate
characterisation of the quantity of molecular gas across the galactic disk, as
derived from observations of the dust.
  Methods: Observations of the optically thin C\$^{18}\$O (2-1) transition were
obtained with the APEX telescope for a sample of 23 massive and dense
star-forming regions in the far outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance greater
than 14 kpc). From the modelling of this line and of the spectral energy
distribution of the selected clumps we computed the gas-to-dust ratio and
compared it to that of well-studied sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 sample in
the inner galactic disk.
  Results: The gradient in gas-to-dust ratio is found to be 0.087 dex/kpc (or
equivalently \gamma\ proportional to Z\$^{-1.4}\$). The dust-to-metal ratio,
decreases with galactocentric radius, which is the most common situation also
for external late-type galaxies. This suggests that grain growth dominates over
destruction. The predicted gas-to-dust ratio is in excellent agreement with the
estimates in Magellanic clouds, for the appropriate value of Z.

of an infectious disease to spread. We consider an epidemic model that is

we prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious
period (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any

distributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with
respect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of
this relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed

of the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the
infectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given
subset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when R0 is fixed,
variability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical
results illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show
how our results apply to message passing, pairwise, and Kermack-McKendrick
epidemic models, even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic

Markakis, Gergely Neu","On the Hardness of Inventory Management with Censored Demand Data",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a repeated newsvendor problem where the inventory manager has no
prior information about the demand, and can access only censored/sales data. In
analogy to multi-armed bandit problems, the manager needs to simultaneously
""explore"" and ""exploit"" with her inventory decisions, in order to minimize the
cumulative cost. We make no probabilistic assumptions---importantly,
independence or time stationarity---regarding the mechanism that creates the
demand sequence. Our goal is to shed light on the hardness of the problem, and
to develop policies that perform well with respect to the regret criterion,
that is, the difference between the cumulative cost of a policy and that of the
best fixed action/static inventory decision in hindsight, uniformly over all
feasible demand sequences. We show that a simple randomized policy, termed the
Exponentially Weighted Forecaster, combined with a carefully designed cost
estimator, achieves optimal scaling of the expected regret (up to logarithmic
factors) with respect to all three key primitives: the number of time periods,
the number of inventory decisions available, and the demand support. Through
this result, we derive an important insight: the benefit from ""information
stalking"" as well as the cost of censoring are both negligible in this dynamic
learning problem, at least with respect to the regret criterion. Furthermore,
we modify the proposed policy in order to perform well in terms of the tracking
regret, that is, using as benchmark the best sequence of inventory decisions
that switches a limited number of times. Numerical experiments suggest that the
proposed approach outperforms existing ones (that are tailored to, or
facilitated by, time stationarity) on nonstationary demand models. Finally, we
extend the proposed approach and its analysis to a ""combinatorial"" version of
the repeated newsvendor problem.

best comparing to other two models, because it will update the input through
LSTM instantaneously, but also does not beat the martingale. In addition, we
introduce an online to batch algorithm and discrepancy measure to inform

dripline. Around the neutron dripline, the weak binding of the last bound
neutron(s) causes the drastic increase of the radius, which is called neutron
halo structure. Although the nucleus $^{24}$O is located at the dripline of
Oxygen isotopes, the separation energies of one and two neutron(s) are 4.19 MeV
and 6.92 MeV, respectively. In spite of this enough binding, the enhancement of
the matter radius is observed. In this study, we microscopically describe the
structure change of $^{22}$O core in $^{24}$O and explain the observed large
radius based on the cluster model. Two degrees of freedom for the large radius;
the relative distances among four $\alpha$ clusters and size of each $\alpha$
cluster are examined, where Tohsaki interaction, which has finite range
three-body terms is employed. The nucleus $^{24}$O has the almost the same
amount of the clusterization compared with $^{22}$O, but the expansion of each
$\alpha$ cluster plays an important role. When two neutrons are added to
$^{22}$O at the center, the expansion of each $\alpha$ clusters is
energetically more favored than enhancing the clustering for reducing the
kinetic energy of the neutrons. The calculated rms matter radius of $^{22}$O
and $^{24}$O are 2.75 fm and 2.92 fm, respectively. Although these are slightly
smaller than the experimental values, the jump at $^{24}$O from $^{22}$O is
reproduced.

binaries are also double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing. Consequently,
solutions for orbital and stellar parameters make the pair of binaries ideal
targets for a study of the colliding winds between two B~stars. {\em Chandra}
ACIS-I observations were obtained to determine X-ray luminosities. AH~Cep was
detected with an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity at a 90\% confidence interval of
$(9-33)\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$, or $(0.5-1.7)\times 10^{-7} L_{\rm Bol}$,
relative to the combined Bolometric luminosities of the two components. While
formally consistent with expectations for embedded wind shocks, or binary wind
collision, the near-twin system of CW~Cep was a surprising non-detection. For
CW~Cep, an upper limit was determined with $L_X/L_{\rm Bol} < 10^{-8}$, again
for the combined components. One difference between these two systems is that
AH~Cep is part of a multiple system. The X-rays from AH~Cep may not arise from
standard wind shocks nor wind collision, but perhaps instead from magnetism in
any one of the four components of the system. The possibility could be tested
by searching for cyclic X-ray variability in AH~Cep on the short orbital period

communication of secondary users (SUs) in a cognitive radio network. The
secondary network operates in three modes; Cooperative Sensing (CS), Full
Duplex Transmit and Sensing (FDTS), and Full Duplex Transmit and Receive
(FDTR). In the CS mode, the secondary nodes detect the activity of primary
users (PUs) through a novel cooperative MAC protocol and will decide the
systems mode of operation in the subsequent spectrum hole. In the FDTS mode one
of the SUs senses the PUs activity continuously whilst transmitting to another
node. In the FDTR mode, the SUs would communicate bidirectionally in an
asynchronous full duplex (FD) manner, with decreased maximum and average
collision durations. Analytical closed forms for probability of collision,
average collision duration and cumulative collision duration, as well as
throughput of the SU network are derived, and performance of the proposed
protocol in terms of above-mentioned metrics, its effectiveness, and advantages
over conventional methods of sensing and transmission are verified via

objective is the sum of a smooth function and a finite number of nonnegative
proper closed possibly nonsmooth functions (whose proximal mappings are easy to

problems arises naturally in various applications when different regularizers
are introduced for inducing simultaneous structures in the solutions. Solving
these problems, however, can be challenging because of the coupled nonsmooth
functions: the corresponding proximal mapping can be hard to compute so that
standard first-order methods such as the proximal gradient algorithm cannot be
applied efficiently. In this paper, we propose a successive
difference-of-convex approximation method for solving this kind of problems. In
this algorithm, we approximate the nonsmooth functions by their Moreau
envelopes in each iteration. Making use of the simple observation that Moreau
envelopes of nonnegative proper closed functions are continuous {\em
difference-of-convex} functions, we can then approximately minimize the
approximation function by first-order methods with suitable majorization
techniques. These first-order methods can be implemented efficiently thanks to
the fact that the proximal mapping of {\em each} nonsmooth function is easy to
compute. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the sequence generated by
our method is bounded and any accumulation point is a stationary point of the

applications such as nonconvex fused regularized optimization problems and
simultaneously structured matrix optimization problems, and illustrate the
performance numerically for these two specific applications.

and rethinking the consequences of the experiment in a new context, theoretical

scientific problem analysis. I apply this analysis to the interplay between
Fizeau's classic optical experiments and the building of special relativity.
Einstein's understanding of the problems facing classical electrodynamics and
optics, in part, was informed by Fizeau's 1851 experiments. However, between
1851 and 1905, Fizeau's experiments were duplicated and reinterpreted by a
succession of scientists, including Hertz, Lorentz, and Michelson. Einstein's
analysis of the consequences of the experiments is tied closely to this
theoretical and experimental tradition. However, Einstein's own inferences from

properties of the cosmological models: the behaviour at, near and due to a jump
discontinuity. It is most interesting that while the usual considerations of
the cosmological dynamics deals heavily in the singularities produced by the
discontinuities of the second kind (a.k.a. the essential discontinuities) of
one (or more) of the physical parameters, almost no research exists to date
that would turn to their natural extension/counterpart: the singularities
induced by the discontinuities of the first kind (a.k.a. the jump
discontinuities). It is this oversight that this article aims to amend. In
fact, it demonstrates that the inclusion of such singularities allows one to
produce a number of very interesting scenarios of cosmological evolution. For
example, it produces the cosmological models with a finite value of the
equation of state parameter $w=p/\rho$ even when both the energy density and
the pressure diverge, while at the same time keeping the scale factor finite.
Such a dynamics is shown to be possible only when the scale factor experiences
a finite jump at some moment of time. Furthermore, if it is the first
derivative of the scale factor that experiences a jump, then a whole new and
different type of a sudden future singularity appears. Finally, jump
discontinuities suffered by either a second or third derivatives of a scale
factor lead to cosmological models experiencing a sudden dephantomization -- or
avoiding the phantomization altogether. This implies that theoretically there
should not be any obstacles for extending the cosmological evolution beyond the
corresponding singularities; therefore, such singularities can be considered a
sort of a cosmological phase transition.

equations to identify single- and double-line outages in a power grid using the
information from phasor measurement unit sensors (PMUs) placed on only a subset
of the buses. Rather than inferring the outage from the sensor data by
inverting the physical model, our approach uses the AC model to simulate sensor
responses to all outages of interest under multiple demand and seasonal
conditions, and uses the resulting data to train a neural network classifier to
recognize and discriminate between different outage events directly from sensor
data. After training, real-time deployment of the classifier requires just a
few matrix-vector products and simple vector operations. These operations can
be executed much more rapidly than inversion of a model based on AC power flow,
which consists of nonlinear equations and possibly integer / binary variables
representing line outages, as well as the variables representing voltages and
power flows. We are motivated to use neural network by its successful
application to such areas as computer vision and natural language processing.
Neural networks automatically find nonlinear transformations of the raw data
that highlight useful features that make the classification task easier. We
describe a principled way to choose sensor locations and show that accurate
classification of line outages can be achieved from a restricted set of
measurements, even over a wide range of demand profiles.

Unfortunately, the requirement of a distance (or, at least, of a neighbourhood

data types such as omics data. However, a number of omics data are metrizable,
i.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a
convolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction. We propose a
generalized solution for CNNs on omics data, implemented through a dedicated
Keras layer. In particular, for metagenomics data, a metric can be derived from
the patristic distance on the phylogenetic tree. For transcriptomics data, we
combine Gene Ontology semantic similarity and gene co-expression to define a
distance; the function is defined through a multilayer network where 3 layers
are defined by the GO mutual semantic similarity while the fourth one by gene
co-expression. As a general tool, feature distance on omics data is enabled by
OmicsConv, a novel Keras layer, obtaining OmicsCNN, a dedicated deep learning

\cite{zayernouri2013fractional}, called \textit{Jacobi poly-fractonomial}s, as
temporal bases, and the eigen-functions of the boundary-value problem of the
second kind as temporal test functions. Next, we construct our spatial
basis/test functions using Legendre polynomials, yielding mass matrices being
independent of the spatial fractional orders ($\mu_i, \, \nu_j, \, i,
\,j=1,2,\cdots,d$). Furthermore, we formulate a novel unified fast linear
solver for the resulting high-dimensional linear system based on the solution
of generalized eigen-problem of spatial mass matrices with respect to the
corresponding stiffness matrices, hence, making the complexity of the problem
optimal, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(N^{d+2})$. We carry out several numerical test
cases to examine the CPU time and convergence rate of the method. The
corresponding stability and error analysis of the Petrov-Galerkin method are
carried out in \cite{samiee2016Unified2}.

smooth integrable differential systems with four zones. When the unperturbed
system has a family of periodic orbits, the first order Melnikov function is
derived which can be used to study the number of limit cycles bifurcated from
the periodic orbits. As an application, using the first order Melnikov function
and Picard-Fuchs equation, we obtain an upper bound of the number of bifurcated
limit cycles of a concrete piecewise smooth differential system.

wave phenomena showing energy increasing with time, with the rate mediated by
the modulation. Until now there has been no accounting for material
dissipation, which clearly counteracts energy growth. This paper provides an
exact expression for the amplitude of elastic or acoustic waves propagating in
lossy materials with properties that are periodically modulated in time. It is
found that these materials can support a special propagation regime in which
waves travel at constant amplitude, with temporal modulation compensating for
the normal energy dissipation. We derive a general condition under which
amplification due to time-dependent properties offsets the material
dissipation. This identity relates band-gap properties associated with the
temporal modulation and the average of the viscosity coefficient, thereby
providing a simple recipe for the design of loss-compensated mechanical
metamaterials.
