(BNS) merger event GW170817. This is the first detection of X-ray emission from
a gravitational-wave source. Observations acquired with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (CXO) at t~2.3 days post merger reveal no significant emission,
with L_x<=3.2x10^38 erg/s (isotropic-equivalent). Continued monitoring revealed
the presence of an X-ray source that brightened with time, reaching L_x\sim
9x10^39 erg/s at ~15.1 days post merger. We interpret these findings in the
context of isotropic and collimated relativistic outflows (both on- and
off-axis). We find that the broad-band X-ray to radio observations are
consistent with emission from a relativistic jet with kinetic energy
E_k~10^49-10^50 erg, viewed off-axis with theta_obs~ 20-40 deg. Our models
favor a circumbinary density n~ 0.0001-0.01 cm-3, depending on the value of the
microphysical parameter epsilon_B=10^{-4}-10^{-2}. A central-engine origin of
the X-ray emission is unlikely. Future X-ray observations at $t\gtrsim 100$
days, when the target will be observable again with the CXO, will provide
additional constraints to solve the model degeneracies and test our
predictions. Our inferences on theta_obs are testable with gravitational wave
information on GW170817 from Advanced LIGO/Virgo on the binary inclination.

X-ray counterpart of GW170817 and the properties of short-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). For this effort, we utilize a sample of 36 short GRBs spanning a
redshift range of $z \approx 0.12-2.6$ discovered over 2004-2017. We find that
the counterpart to GW170817 has an isotropic-equivalent luminosity that is
$\approx 3000$ times less than the median value of on-axis short GRB X-ray
afterglows, and $\gtrsim10^{4}$ times less than that for detected short GRB
radio afterglows. Moreover, the allowed jet energies and particle densities
inferred from the radio and X-ray counterparts to GW170817 and on-axis short
GRB afterglows are remarkably similar, suggesting that viewing angle effects
are the dominant, and perhaps only, difference in their observed radio and
X-ray behavior. From comparison to previous claimed kilonovae following short
GRBs, we find that the optical and near-IR counterpart to GW170817 is
comparatively under-luminous by a factor of $\approx 3-5$, indicating a range
of kilonova luminosities and timescales. A comparison of the optical limits
following short GRBs on $\lesssim 1$ day timescales also rules out a ""blue""
kilonova of comparable optical isotropic-equivalent luminosity in one previous
short GRB. Finally, we investigate the host galaxy of GW170817, NGC4993, in the
context of short GRB host galaxy stellar population properties. We find that
NGC4993 is superlative in terms of its large luminosity, old stellar population
age, and low star formation rate compared to previous short GRB hosts.
Additional events within the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO volume will be crucial in
delineating the properties of the host galaxies of NS-NS mergers, and
connecting them to their cosmological counterparts.

We arrive at this conclusion by comparing the optical properties of SSS17a to
other known astrophysical transients, finding that SSS17a fades and cools
faster than any other observed transient. For instance, SSS17a fades >5 mag in
g within 7 days of our first data point while all other known transients of
similar luminosity fade by <1 mag during the same time period. Its spectra are
also unique, being mostly featureless, even as it cools. The rarity of

volume and recent non-detection imply the extremely unlikely chance
coincidence. We find that the volumetric rate of SSS17a-like transients is <
1.6 x 10^4 Gpc^-3 year^-1 and the Milky Way rate is <0.19 per century. A
transient survey designed to discover similar events should be high cadence and
observe in red filters. The LVC will likely detect substantially more BNS
mergers than current optical surveys will independently discover SSS17a-like

fainter than every SGRB-associated KN claimed so far, we find three bursts

etc). Ultimately disentangling these properties should be possible through
observations of SGRBs and gravitational wave sources, providing direct

star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst,
GRB170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a),
was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present
ultraviolet, optical and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9
hours to 18 days post-merger. We constrain the radioactively-powered transient
resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the
light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with
multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time

Large Telescope MUSE integral field spectroscopy of the counterpart and host
galaxy of the first binary neutron star merger detected via gravitational wave
emission by LIGO & Virgo, GW170817. The host galaxy, NGC 4993, is an S0 galaxy
at z=0.009783. There is evidence for large, face-on spiral shells in continuum
imaging, and edge-on spiral features visible in nebular emission lines. This
suggests that NGC 4993 has undergone a relatively recent (<1 Gyr) ``dry''
merger. This merger may provide the fuel for a weak active nucleus seen in
Chandra imaging. At the location of the counterpart, HST imaging implies there
is no globular or young stellar cluster, with a limit of a few thousand solar
masses for any young system. The population in the vicinity is predominantly
old with <1% of any light arising from a population with ages <500 Myr. Both
the host galaxy properties and those of the transient location are consistent
with the distributions seen for short-duration gamma-ray bursts, although the
source position lies well within the effective radius (r_e ~ 3 kpc), providing
an r_e-normalized offset that is closer than ~90% of short GRBs. For the long
delay time implied by the stellar population, this suggests that the kick
velocity was significantly less than the galaxy escape velocity. We do not see
any narrow host galaxy interstellar medium features within the counterpart
spectrum, implying low extinction, and that the binary may lie in front of the
bulk of the host galaxy.

than iron are produced has been a puzzle for several decades. Here we discuss
the role of neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the light of the first direct
detection of such an event in both gravitational (GW) and electromagnetic (EM)
waves. We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double
neutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based
macronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the
radioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with $Y_e \lesssim 0.3$ (but not
larger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the
electromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular ""nickel winds"" as major
source of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted
either with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta. Our limits on the ejecta mass
together with estimated rates directly confirm earlier purely theoretical or
indirect observational conclusions that double neutron star mergers are indeed
a major site of cosmic nucleosynthesis. If the ejecta mass was {\em typical},
NSMs can easily produce {\em all} of the estimated Galactic r-process matter,
and --depending on the real rate-- potentially even more. This could be a hint
that the event ejected a particularly large amount of mass, maybe due to a
substantial difference between the component masses. This would be compatible
with the mass limits obtained from the GW-observation. The recent observations
suggests that NSMs are responsible for a broad range of r-process nuclei and
that they are at least a major, but likely the dominant r-process site in the
Universe.

$\sim2$ seconds. The appearance of a thermal component at the end of the burst

supplies the black hole with magnetic flux and confines the

quasispherical breakout of the jet from the disk wind. As the jet plows through
the wind with subrelativistic velocity, it creates a radiation-dominated shock
that heats the wind material to tens of kiloelectron volts, producing the soft
thermal component.

particular, evidence for this scenario is found from broad features seen in

opposed to a binary consisting of a neutron star and a black hole). For
dynamical ejecta, the high mass favors a small neutron star radius of $\lesssim

density, we predict the emergence of late-time radio emission from the
deceleration of the kilonova (KN) ejecta on a timescale of $\sim 5-10$ years
that will remain detectable for decades with next-generation radio facilities,
making GW\,170817 a compelling target for long-term radio monitoring.

gravitational wave (GW) event from the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS)
system and the first with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We use both
archival photometry and new optical/near-IR imaging and spectroscopy, together
with stellar population synthesis models to infer the global properties of the
host galaxy. We infer a star formation history peaked at $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago,
with subsequent exponential decline leading to a low current star formation
rate of 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which we convert into a binary merger
timescale probability distribution. We find a median merger timescale of
$11.2^{+0.7}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, with a 90% confidence range of $6.8-13.6$ Gyr. This
in turn indicates an initial binary separation of $\approx 4.5$ R$_{\odot}$,
comparable to the inferred values for Galactic BNS systems. We also use new and
archival $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ images to measure a projected offset of
the optical counterpart of $2.1$ kpc (0.64$r_{e}$) from the center of NGC 4993
and to place a limit of $M_{r} \gtrsim -7.2$ mag on any pre-existing emission,
which rules out the brighter half of the globular cluster luminosity function.
Finally, the age and offset of the system indicates it experienced a modest
natal kick with an upper limit of $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. Future GW$-$EM
observations of BNS mergers will enable measurement of their population delay
time distribution, which will directly inform their viability as the dominant
source of $r$-process enrichment in the Universe.

counterpart of the first binary neutron star merger detected through
gravitational wave emission, GW170817. Our observations commenced 10.5 hours
post-merger, as soon as the localization region became accessible from Chile.
We imaged 70 deg$^2$ in the $i$ and $z$ bands, covering 93\% of the initial
integrated localization probability, to a depth necessary to identify likely
optical counterparts (e.g., a kilonova). At 11.4 hours post-merger we detected
a bright optical transient located $10.6''$ from the nucleus of NGC\,4993 at
redshift $z=0.0098$, consistent (for $H_0 = 70$\, km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) with
the distance of $40 \pm 8$\, Mpc reported by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
and the Virgo Collaboration (LVC). At detection the transient had magnitudes
$i\approx 17.30$ and $z\approx 17.45$, and thus an absolute magnitude of $M_i =
-15.7$, in the luminosity range expected for a kilonova. We identified 1,500
potential transient candidates. Applying simple selection criteria aimed at
rejecting background events such as supernovae, we find the transient
associated with NGC\,4993 as the only remaining plausible counterpart, and
reject chance coincidence at the 99.5\% confidence level. We therefore conclude
that the optical counterpart we have identified near NGC\,4993 is associated
with GW170817. This discovery ushers in the era of multi-messenger astronomy
with gravitational waves, and demonstrates the power of DECam to identify the
optical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources.

The event turns out to be compatible with a neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS)

(e.m.) counterpart. At the LVC detection time $T_0$, the GW170817 LR was
occulted by the Earth. The AGILE instrument collected useful data before and
after the GW-GRB event because in its spinning observation mode it can scan a
given source many times per hour. The earliest exposure of the GW170817 LR by
the gamma-ray imaging detector (GRID) started about 935 s after $T_0$. No

repeatedly exposed over timescales of minutes, hours, and days before and after

Theoretical modelling shows that the matter that is expelled in the violent
merger of two neutron stars can assemble into heavy elements such as gold and
platinum in a process known as rapid neutron capture (r-process)
nucleosynthesis. The radioactive decay of isotopes of the heavy elements is
predicted to power a distinctive thermal glow (a 'kilonova'). The discovery of
an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational-wave source GW170817
represents the first opportunity to detect and scrutinize a sample of freshly
synthesized r-process elements. Here we report models that predict the detailed
electromagnetic emission of kilonovae and enable the mass, velocity and
composition of ejecta to be derived from the observations. We compare the
models to the optical and infrared radiation associated with GW170817 event to
argue that the observed source is a kilonova. We infer the presence of two
distinct components of ejecta, one composed primarily of light (atomic mass
number less than 140) and one of heavy (atomic mass number greater than 140)
r-process elements. Inferring the ejected mass and a merger rate from GW170817
implies that such mergers are a dominant mode of r-process production in the
Universe.

Accurate clock synchronization is the backbone of systems managing power
distribution, financial transactions, telecommunication operations, database

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), are based on one-way communication
from a master to a slave clock. Others, such as the Network Transport Protocol
(NTP), and the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), involve two-way
communication between the master and slave. This paper shows that all one-way
time transfer protocols are vulnerable to replay attacks that can potentially
compromise timing information. A set of conditions for secure two-way clock
synchronization is proposed and proved to be necessary and sufficient. It is
shown that IEEE 1588 PTP, although a two-way synchronization protocol, is not
compliant with these conditions, and is therefore insecure. Requirements for
secure IEEE 1588 PTP are proposed, and a second example protocol is offered to
illustrate the range of compliant systems.

work is to provide the first complete and robust photometric empirical

used a 3D extinction map to select low reddening red giants. To calibrate the
colour-colour and the effective temperature-colour relations, we developed a
MCMC method which accounts for all variable uncertainties and selects the best
model for each photometric relation. We estimate the Red Clump absolute
magnitude through the mode of a kernel-based distribution function. We provide
20 colour vs G-Ks relations and the first Teff vs G-Ks calibration. We obtained
the Red Clump absolute magnitudes for 15 photometric bands with, in particular,
M_Ks = -1.606 +/- 0.009 and M_G = (0.495 +/- 0.009) + (1.121 +/- 0.128)

short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) from a binary neutron star merger had been
detected. The followup optical/infrared observations also identified the
macronova/kilonova emission (AT2017gfo). In this work we discuss some
implications of the remarkable GW170817/GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo association. We
show that the $\sim 1.7$s time delay between the gravitational wave (GW) and
GRB signals imposes very tight constraint on the superluminal movement of
gravitational waves (i.e., the relative departure of GW velocity from the speed
of light is $\leq 4.3\times 10^{-16}$) or the possible violation of weak
equivalence principle (i.e., the difference of the gamma-ray and GW
trajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy and the local universe
should be within a factor of $\sim 3.4\times 10^{-9}$). The so-called Dark
Matter Emulators and a class of contender models for cosmic acceleration
(""Covariant Galileon"") are ruled out, too. The successful identification of
Lanthanide elements in the macronova/kilonova spectrum also excludes the
possibility that the progenitors of GRB 170817A are a binary strange star
system. The high neutron star merger rate (inferred from both the local sGRB
data and the gravitational wave data) together with the significant ejected
mass strongly suggest that such mergers are the prime sites of heavy r-process
nucleosynthesis.

Fermi/GBM (called GW 170817) is a milestone for the establishment of
multi-messenger astronomy. Merging neutron stars (NS) represent the standard
scenario for short-duration (< 2 sec) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which are
produced in a collimated, relativistically expanding jet with an opening angle
of a few degrees and a bulk Lorentz factor of 300-1000. While the present aLIGO
detection is consistent with predictions, the measured faint gamma-ray emission
from GW 170817A, if associated to the merger event at a distance of 40 Mpc, is
about 1000x less luminous than known short-duration GRBs (sGRBs). Hence, the
presence of this sGRB in the local Universe is either a very rare event, or
points to a dramatic ignorance of the emission properties of sGRBs outside
their narrow jets. Here we show that the majority of previously detected faint
sGRBs are local, at redshift smaller than 0.1, seen off-axis. In contrast, the
brighter sGRBs are seen on-axis, and therefore out to larger distances,
consistent with the measured redshift distribution. Examining the
observer-frame parameter space of all Fermi/GBM sGRBs shows that the sGRB
associated with GW 170817A is extreme in its combination of flux, spectral
softness and temporal structure. We identify a group of similar GRBs, one of
which has been associated to a bright galaxy at 75 Mpc. We incorporate off-axis
emission in the estimate of the rates of sGRBs, and predict that the majority
of future GW-detections of NS-NS mergers will be accompanied by faint gamma-ray
emission, contrary to previous thinking. The much more frequent off-axis
emission of sGRBs also implies a much higher deadly rate of gamma-rays for
extraterrestrial life in the Universe.

alignment interactions and rotations suggesting that they might occur
generically in many chiral active matter systems. However, although excluded
volume interactions occur naturally among typical circle swimmers, it is not
yet clear if macro-clusters and micro-flock patterns survive their presence.

dwarfs as probes of fundamental physics. We quantify the effects of varying
fundamental couplings on the white dwarf mass-radius relation in a broad class
of unification scenarios, both for the simple case of a polytropic stellar
structure model and for more general models. Independent measurements of the
mass and radius, together with direct spectroscopic measurements of the
fine-structure constant in white dwarf atmospheres lead to constraints on
combinations of the two phenomenological parameters describing the underlying
unification scenario (one of which is related to the strong sector of the
theory while the other is related to the electroweak sector). While currently
available measurements do not yet provide stringent constraints, we show that
forthcoming improvements, expected for example from the Gaia satellite, can
break parameter degeneracies and lead to constraints that ideally complement
those obtained from local laboratory tests using atomic clocks.

desirable property is the ability to implement switching. Here we show how to
implement switching in a model of dipolar bosons confined to three coupled
wells. The model describes interactions between bosons, tunneling of bosons
between adjacent wells, and the effect of an external field. We conduct a study
of the quantum dynamics of the system to probe the conditions under which
switching behavior can occur. The analysis considers both integrable and
non-integrable regimes within the model. Through variation of the external

gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron
star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined
signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one
per $8.0\times10^4$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be
between 0.86 and 2.26 $M_\odot$, in agreement with masses of known neutron
stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron
stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 $M_\odot$,
with the total mass of the system $2.74^{+0.04}_{-0.01}\,M_\odot$. The source
was localized within a sky region of 28 deg$^2$ (90% probability) and had a
luminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-14}$ Mpc, the closest and most precisely
localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray
burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence,
corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first
direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts.
Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic
spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event
as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and
electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter,
gravitation and cosmology.

designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through
gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The
Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB
170817A) with a time delay of $\sim$1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From
the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky
region of 31 deg$^2$ at a luminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-8}$ Mpc and with
component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later
measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 Msun. An extensive observing campaign
was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a
bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT
2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at $\sim$40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by
the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The
optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour.
Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early
ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours.
Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over $\sim$10
days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered
at the transient's position $\sim$9 and $\sim$16 days, respectively, after the
merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process
that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared
emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent
with the source were found in follow-up searches. (Abridged)

Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A
was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the
Anticoincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray
Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and
spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is
$5.0\times 10^{-8}$. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a
progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides
new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short gamma-ray bursts.
We use the observed time delay of $(+1.74 \pm 0.05)\,$s between GRB 170817A and
GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the
speed of light to be between $-3\times 10^{-15}$ and $+7\times 10^{-16}$ times
the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz
invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by
constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic
radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz
factor of the region emitting the gamma rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short
GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less
energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of
gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be
essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we
predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the
Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1--1.4 per year during the 2018-2019
observing run and 0.3--1.7 per year at design sensitivity.

  Serra-Ricart (The MASTER Collaboration)","A gravitational-wave standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant","26 pages, 5 figures, Nature in press. For more information see
  https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1700296/public",,"10.1038/nature24471","LIGO P1700296","astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic
waves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17
August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong
signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds
after the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region
of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the
gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical
astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient
signal within $\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger
observations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the
gravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the
Hubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of
the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental
importance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source
inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity
inferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This
approach does not require any form of cosmic ""distance ladder;"" the
gravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out
to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical
distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be
$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent with
existing measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional
standard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide
precision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.

  Associated with GW170817","18 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/aa9478","LIGO-P1700309","astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The source of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, very likely a binary
neutron star merger, was also observed electromagnetically, providing the first
multi-messenger observations of this type. The two week long electromagnetic
counterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical
transient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the
dynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation
of the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological
model calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta.
Specifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the
gravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical
ejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the
corresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of
dynamical ejecta mass range between $M_{ej} = 10^{-3} - 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$ for
various equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In
addition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron
star merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of
events like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta
mass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if $\gtrsim10\%$ of the
matter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements,
GW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process
material observed in the Milky Way.

  from Compact Binary Coalescences","12 pages, 3 figures","Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 091101 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.091101","LIGO P1700272","gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations have announced the first
detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of two neutron stars. The
merger rate of binary neutron stars estimated from this event suggests that
distant, unresolvable binary neutron stars create a significant astrophysical
stochastic gravitational-wave background. The binary neutron star background
will add to the background from binary black holes, increasing the amplitude of
the total astrophysical background relative to previous expectations. In the
Advanced LIGO-Virgo frequency band most sensitive to stochastic backgrounds
(near 25 Hz), we predict a total astrophysical background with amplitude
$\Omega_{\rm GW} (f=25 \text{Hz}) = 1.8_{-1.3}^{+2.7} \times 10^{-9}$ with
$90\%$ confidence, compared with $\Omega_{\rm GW} (f=25 \text{Hz}) =
1.1_{-0.7}^{+1.2} \times 10^{-9}$ from binary black holes alone. Assuming the
most probable rate for compact binary mergers, we find that the total
background may be detectable with a signal-to-noise-ratio of 3 after 40 months
of total observation time, based on the expected timeline for Advanced LIGO and
Virgo to reach their design sensitivity.

with two neutron stars was discovered through gravitational-wave (GW170817),
gamma-ray (GRB 170817A), and optical (SSS17a/AT 2017gfo) observations. The
optical source was associated with the early-type galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance
of just $\sim$40 Mpc, consistent with the gravitational-wave measurement, and
the merger was localized to be at a projected distance of $\sim$2 kpc away from
the galaxy's center. We use this minimal set of facts and the mass posteriors
of the two neutron stars to derive the first constraints on the progenitor of
GW170817 at the time of the second supernova (SN). We generate simulated
progenitor populations and follow the three-dimensional kinematic evolution
from the binary neutron star (BNS) birth to the merger time, accounting for
pre-SN galactic motion, for considerably different input distributions of the
progenitor mass, pre-SN semimajor axis, and SN-kick velocity. Though not
considerably tight, we find these constraints to be comparable to those for
Galactic BNS progenitors. The derived constraints are very strongly influenced
by the requirement of keeping the binary bound after the second SN and having
the merger occur relatively close to the center of the galaxy. These
constraints are insensitive to the galaxy's star formation history, provided
the stellar populations are older than 1 Gyr.

gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral. A short gamma-ray
burst (GRB) that followed the merger of this binary was also recorded by the
Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and the Anticoincidence Shield for
the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory
(INTEGRAL), indicating particle acceleration by the source. The precise
location of the event was determined by optical detections of emission
following the merger. We searched for high-energy neutrinos from the merger in
the GeV--EeV energy range using the ANTARES, IceCube, and Pierre Auger
Observatories. No neutrinos directionally coincident with the source were
detected within $\pm500$ s around the merger time. Additionally, no MeV
neutrino burst signal was detected coincident with the merger. We further
carried out an extended search in the direction of the source for high-energy
neutrinos within the 14-day period following the merger, but found no evidence
of emission. We used these results to probe dissipation mechanisms in
relativistic outflows driven by the binary neutron star merger. The
non-detection is consistent with model predictions of short GRBs observed at a
large off-axis angle.

counterpart to a gravitational wave source from Advanced LIGO/Virgo, the binary
neutron star merger GW170817. Our data set extends from the discovery of the
optical counterpart at $0.47$ days to $18.5$ days post-merger, and includes
observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS-2
(GS/F2), and the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\it HST}). The spectral energy
distribution (SED) inferred from this photometry at $0.6$ days is well
described by a blackbody model with $T\approx 8300$ K, a radius of $R\approx
4.5\times 10^{14}$ cm (corresponding to an expansion velocity of $v\approx
0.3c$), and a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}\approx 5\times10^{41}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. At $1.5$ days we find a multi-component SED across the optical and
NIR, and subsequently we observe rapid fading in the UV and blue optical bands
and significant reddening of the optical/NIR colors. Modeling the entire data
set we find that models with heating from radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, or
those with only a single component of opacity from $r$-process elements, fail
to capture the rapid optical decline and red optical/NIR colors. Instead,
models with two components consistent with lanthanide-poor and lanthanide-rich
ejecta provide a good fit to the data, the resulting ""blue"" component has
$M_\mathrm{ej}^\mathrm{blue}\approx 0.01$ M$_\odot$ and
$v_\mathrm{ej}^\mathrm{blue}\approx 0.3$c, and the ""red"" component has
$M_\mathrm{ej}^\mathrm{red}\approx 0.04$ M$_\odot$ and
$v_\mathrm{ej}^\mathrm{red}\approx 0.1$c. These ejecta masses are broadly
consistent with the estimated $r$-process production rate required to explain
the Milky Way $r$-process abundances, providing the first evidence that BNS
mergers can be a dominant site of $r$-process enrichment.

mergers and they should also be detectable from lower mass neutron star
mergers. These are predicted to eject material rich in heavy radioactive
isotopes that can power an electromagnetic signal called a kilonova. The
gravitational wave source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron star merger in
the nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and distance
estimate. Here we report observations and physical modelling of a rapidly
fading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy NGC4993, which is spatially
coincident with GW170817 and a weak short gamma-ray burst. The transient has
physical parameters broadly matching the theoretical predictions of blue
kilonovae from neutron star mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can
be explained with an ejected mass of 0.04 +/- 0.01 Msol, with an opacity of
kappa <= 0.5 cm2/gm at a velocity of 0.2 +/- 0.1c. The power source is
constrained to have a power law slope of beta = -1.2 +/- 0.3, consistent with
radioactive powering from r-process nuclides. We identify line features in the
spectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (90 < A < 140). As it
fades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and emission may have contribution by
a higher opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta component. This indicates that neutron
star mergers produce gravitational waves, radioactively powered kilonovae, and
are a nucleosynthetic source of the r-process elements.

median Schechter function galaxy luminosity. We use a prioritization algorithm
to select the galaxies with the highest chance of containing the counterpart
given their luminosity, their position, and their distance relative to a GW
localization, and in which we are most likely to detect a counterpart given its
expected brightness compared to the limiting magnitude of our telescopes. This
algorithm can be easily adapted to any expected transient parameters and
telescopes. We implemented this strategy during the second Advanced Detector

kilonova/macronova counterpart thanks to our algorithm selecting the correct

  neutron-star merger","Published in Nature",,"10.1038/nature24291",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The merger of two neutron stars has been predicted to produce an
optical-infrared transient (lasting a few days) known as a 'kilonova', powered
by the radioactive decay of neutron-rich species synthesized in the merger.
Evidence that short gamma-ray bursts also arise from neutron-star mergers has
been accumulating. In models of such mergers a small amount of mass
($10^{-4}$-$10^{-2}$ solar masses) with a low electron fraction is ejected at
high velocities (0.1-0.3 times light speed) and/or carried out by winds from an
accretion disk formed around the newly merged object. This mass is expected to
undergo rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, leading to the
formation of radioactive elements that release energy as they decay, powering
an electromagnetic transient. A large uncertainty in the composition of the
newly synthesized material leads to various expected colours, durations and
luminosities for such transients. Observational evidence for kilonovae has so
far been inconclusive as it was based on cases of moderate excess emission
detected in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Here we report optical to
near-infrared observations of a transient coincident with the detection of the
gravitational-wave signature of a binary neutron-star merger and of a
low-luminosity short-duration gamma-ray burst. Our observations, taken roughly
every eight hours over a few days following the gravitational-wave trigger,
reveal an initial blue excess, with fast optical fading and reddening. Using
numerical models, we conclude that our data are broadly consistent with a light
curve powered by a few hundredths of a solar mass of low-opacity material
corresponding to lanthanide-poor (a fraction of $10^{-4.5}$ by mass) ejecta.

number of KNe that could be found in data from past, present and future surveys

spectral time-series model based on the DES-GW multi-band light-curve from the
single known KN event, and we use an average of BNS rates from past studies of
$10^3 \rm{Gpc}^{-3}/\rm{year}$, consistent with the $1$ event found so far.
Examining past and current datasets from transient surveys, the number of KNe
we expect to find for ASAS-SN, SDSS, PS1, SNLS, DES, and SMT is between 0 and
$0.3$. We predict the number of detections per future survey to be: 8.3 from
ATLAS, 10.6 from ZTF, 5.5/69 from LSST (the Deep Drilling / Wide Fast Deep),
and 16.0 from WFIRST. The maximum redshift of KNe discovered for each survey is
z = 0.8 for WFIRST, z = 0.25 for LSST and z = 0.04 for ZTF and ATLAS. For the
LSST survey, we also provide contamination estimates from Type Ia and
Core-collapse supernovae: after light-curve and template-matching requirements,
we estimate a background of just 2 events. More broadly, we stress that future
transient surveys should consider how to optimize their search strategies to
improve their detection efficiency, and to consider similar analyses for GW
follow-up programs.

from approximately 6400K to 2100K over a 7-day period and produced no
significant optical emission lines. The spectral profiles, cooling rate, and
photometric light curves are consistent with the expected outburst and
subsequent processes of a binary neutron star merger. Star formation in the
host galaxy probably ceased at least a Gyr ago, although there is evidence for
a galaxy merger. Binary pulsars with short (100 Myr) decay times are therefore
unlikely progenitors, but pulsars like PSR B1534+12 with its 2.7 Gyr
coalescence time could produce such a merger. The displacement (about 2.2 kpc)
of the binary star system from the centre of the main galaxy is not unusual for
stars in the host galaxy or stars originating in the merging galaxy, and
therefore any constraints on the kick velocity imparted to the progenitor are
poor.

gravitational-wave (GW) sources with LIGO. They are also thought to produce
short $\gamma$-ray bursts (SGRBs), and kilonovae that are powered by r-process
nuclei. Detecting these phenomena simultaneously would provide an unprecedented
view of the physics during and after the merger of two compact objects. Such a
Rosetta Stone event was detected by LIGO/Virgo on 17 August 2017 at a distance
of $\sim 44$ Mpc. We monitored the position of the BNSM with ALMA at 338.5 GHz
and GMRT at 1.4 GHz, from 1.4 to 44 days after the merger. Our observations
rule out any afterglow more luminous than $3\times 10^{26}~{\rm
erg\,s}^{-1}\,{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ in these bands, probing $>$2--4 dex fainter than
previous SGRB limits. We match these limits, in conjunction with public data
announcing the appearance of X-ray and radio emission in the weeks after the GW
event, to templates of off-axis afterglows. Our broadband modeling suggests
that GW170817 was accompanied by a SGRB and that the GRB jet, powered by
$E_{\rm AG,\,iso}\sim10^{50}$~erg, had a half-opening angle of $\sim20^\circ$,
and was misaligned by $\sim41^\circ$ from our line of sight. The data are also
consistent with a more collimated jet: $E_{\rm AG,\,iso}\sim10^{51}$~erg,
$\theta_{1/2,\,\rm jet}\sim5^\circ$, $\theta_{\rm obs}\sim17^\circ$. This is
the most conclusive detection of an off-axis GRB afterglow and the first
associated with a BNSM-GW event to date. Assuming a uniform top-hat jet, we use
the viewing angle estimates to infer the initial bulk Lorentz factor and true
energy release of the burst.

not comparable with supernovae light curves at any epoch. The color of SSS17a
also evolves rapidly and becomes redder for later epochs; the $z-H$ color
changed by approximately 2.5 mag in the period of 0.7 days to 7.7 days. The
rapid evolution of both the optical brightness and the color are consistent
with the expected properties of a kilonova that is powered by the radioactive
decay of newly synthesized $r$-process nuclei. Kilonova models with Lanthanide
elements can reproduce the aforementioned observed properties well, which
suggests that $r$-process nucleosynthesis beyond the second peak takes place in
SSS17a. However, the absolute magnitude of SSS17a is brighter than the expected

(NS) is predicted to produce gravitational waves (GWs) and short duration gamma
ray bursts (GRBs). In the process, neutron-rich material is ejected from the
system and heavy elements are synthesized by r-process nucleosynthesis. The
radioactive decay of these heavy elements produces additional transient
radiation termed ""kilonova"" or ""macronova"". We report the detection of linear
optical polarization P = (0.50 +/- 0.07)% at 1.46 days after detection of the
GWs from GW170817, a double neutron star merger associated with an optical
macronova counterpart and a short GRB. The optical emission from a macronova is
expected to be characterized by a blue, rapidly decaying, component and a red,
more slowly evolving, component due to material rich of heavy elements, the
lanthanides. The polarization measurement was made when the macronova was still
in its blue phase, during which there is an important contribution from a
lanthanide-free outflow. The low degree of polarization is consistent with
intrinsically unpolarized emission scattered by Galactic dust, suggesting a
symmetric geometry of the emitting region and low inclination of the merger
system. Stringent upper limits to the polarization degree from 2.45 - 9.48 days
post-burst are consistent with the lanthanides-rich macronova interpretation.

GW170817 and identification of an electromagnetic counterpart provide a unique
opportunity to study the physical processes in NS mergers. To derive properties
of ejected material from the NS merger, we perform radiative transfer
simulations of kilonova, optical and near-infrared emissions powered by
radioactive decays of r-process nuclei synthesized in the merger. We find that
the observed near-infrared emission lasting for > 10 days is explained by 0.03
Msun of ejecta containing lanthanide elements. However, the blue optical
component observed at the initial phases requires an ejecta component with a
relatively high electron fraction (Ye). We show that both optical and
near-infrared emissions are simultaneously reproduced by the ejecta with a
medium Ye of ~ 0.25. We suggest that a dominant component powering the emission
is post-merger ejecta, which exhibits that mass ejection after the first
dynamical ejection is quite efficient. Our results indicate that NS mergers
synthesize a wide range of r-process elements and strengthen the hypothesis
that NS mergers are the origin of r-process elements in the Universe.

of the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by LIGO and Virgo,

kilonova (KN), we have not been able to definitively test these models until
now. From one day to four days after the merger, we took five spectra of AT
2017gfo before it faded away, which was possible because it was at a distance
of only 39.5 Mpc in the galaxy NGC 4993. The spectra evolve from blue
($\sim6400$K) to red ($\sim3500$K) over the three days we observed. The spectra
are relatively featureless --- some weak features exist in our latest spectrum,
but they are likely due to the host galaxy. However, a simple blackbody is not
sufficient to explain our data: another source of luminosity or opacity is
necessary. Predictions from simulations of KNe qualitatively match the observed
spectroscopic evolution after two days past the merger, but underpredict the
blue flux in our earliest spectrum. From our best-fit models, we infer that AT
2017gfo had an ejecta mass of $0.03M_\odot$, high ejecta velocities of $0.3c$,
and a low mass fraction $\sim10^{-4}$ of high-opacity lanthanides and
actinides. One possible explanation for the early excess of blue flux is that
the outer ejecta is lanthanide-poor, while the inner ejecta has a higher
abundance of high-opacity material. With the discovery and follow-up of this
unique transient, combining gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy,
we have arrived in the multi-messenger era.

Based on our MUSE/VLT measurement of the heliocentric redshift ($z_{\rm

NGC 4993 group of galaxies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) frame to be

cosmic}=2924 \pm 236$ km s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\rm cosmic}=0.00980\pm 0.00079$) and a
distance of $D_z=40.4\pm 3.4$ Mpc assuming a local Hubble constant of
$H_0=73.24\pm 1.74$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. (2) Using Hubble Space Telescope
measurements of the effective radius (15.5"" $\pm$ 1.5"") and contained intensity
and MUSE/VLT measurements of the velocity dispersion, we place NGC 4993 on the
Fundamental Plane (FP) of E and S0 galaxies. Comparing to a frame of 10

FP}=44.0\pm 7.5$ Mpc. The combined redshift and FP distance is $D_{\rm NGC
4993}= 41.0\pm 3.1$ Mpc. This 'electromagnetic' distance estimate is consistent
with the independent measurement of the distance to GW170817 as obtained from
the gravitational-wave signal ($D_{\rm GW}= 43.8^{+2.9}_{-6.9}$ Mpc) and
confirms that GW170817 occurred in NGC 4993.

detectable phenomena: a short burst of gamma-rays, a gravitational wave signal,
and a transient optical/near-infrared source powered by the synthesis of large
amounts of very heavy elements via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). Such
transients, named ""macronovae"" or ""kilonovae"", are believed to be centres of
production of rare elements such as gold and platinum. The most compelling
evidence so far for a kilonova was a very faint near-infrared rebrightening in
the afterglow of a short gamma-ray burst at z = 0.356, although findings
indicating bluer events have been reported. Here we report the spectral
identification and describe the physical properties of a bright kilonova
associated with the gravitational wave source GW 170817 and gamma-ray burst GRB
170817A associated with a galaxy at a distance of 40 Mpc from Earth. Using a
series of spectra from ground-based observatories covering the wavelength range
from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we find that the kilonova is
characterized by rapidly expanding ejecta with spectral features similar to
those predicted by current models. The ejecta is optically thick early on, with
a velocity of about 0.2 times light speed, and reaches a radius of about 50
astronomical units in only 1.5 days. As the ejecta expands, broad
absorption-like lines appear on the spectral continuum indicating atomic
species produced by nucleosynthesis that occurs in the post-merger fast-moving
dynamical ejecta and in two slower (0.05 times light speed) wind regions.
Comparison with spectral models suggests that the merger ejected 0.03-0.05
solar masses of material, including high-opacity lanthanides.

accelerate a small fraction (~ 10^-6) of the neutron star mass in an isotropic

fireball can form, which undergoes accelerated expansion reaching relativistic
velocities. As in the standard fireball scenario, internal energy is partly
transformed into kinetic energy. At the photospheric radius, the internal
radiation can escape, giving rise to a pulse that lasts for a time equal to the
delay time since the merger. The subsequent interaction with the interstellar
medium can then convert part of the remaining kinetic energy back into
radiation in a weak isotropic afterglow at all wavelengths. This scenario does
not require the presence of a jet: the associated isotropic prompt and
afterglow emission should be visible for all NS-NS and BH-NS mergers within 90
Mpc, independent of their inclination. The prompt emission is similar to that
expected from an off-axis jet, either structured or much slower than usually
assumed (Gamma ~ 10), or from the jet cocoon. The predicted afterglow emission
properties can discriminate among these scenarios.

been identified in NGC 4993 galaxy. Together with evidence from observations in
electromagnetic waves, the event has been suggested as a result of a merger of
two neutron stars. We analyze the multi-wavelength data to characterize the
host galaxy property and its distance to examine if the properties of NGC 4993
are consistent with this picture. Our analysis shows that NGC 4993 is a
bulge-dominated galaxy with reff ~ 2-3 kpc and the Sersic index of n = 3-4 for
the bulge component. The spectral energy distribution from 0.15 to 24 micron
indicates that this galaxy has no significant ongoing star formation, the mean
stellar mass of (0.3 - 1.2) times 10^11 Msun,the mean stellar age greater than
~3 Gyr, and the metallicity of about 20% to 100% of solar abundance. Optical
images reveal dust lanes and extended features that suggest a past merging
activity. Overall, NGC 4993 has characteristics of normal, but slightly
disturbed elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, we derive the distance to NGC 4993
with the fundamental plane relation using 17 parameter sets of 7 different
filters and the central stellar velocity dispersion from literature, finding an
angular diameter distance of 37.7 +- 8.7 Mpc. NGC 4993 is similar to some host
galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts but much different from those of long
gamma-ray bursts, supporting the picture of GW170817 as a result of a merger of
two NSs.

electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source, GW170817, a binary
neutron star merger, exhibited a strong evolution from blue to near-infrared (a
so-called 'kilonova' or 'macronova'). The emerging near-infrared component is
widely attributed to the formation of r-process elements which provide the
opacity to shift the blue light into the near infrared. An alternative scenario
is that the light from the blue component gets extinguished by dust formed by
the kilonova and subsequently is re-emitted at near-infrared wavelengths. We
here test this hypothesis using the lightcurves of AT2017gfo, the kilonova
accompanying GW170817. We find that of order 10$^{-5}$ $M_\odot$ of carbon is
required to reproduce the optical/near-infrared lightcurves as the kilonova
fades. This putative dust cools from $\sim$ 2000 K at $\sim$ 4 d after the
event to $\sim$ 1500 K over the course of the following week, thus requiring
dust with a high condensation temperature, such as carbon. We contrast this
with the nucleosynthetic yields predicted by a range of kilonova wind models.
These suggest that at most 10$^{-9}$ $M_\odot$ of carbon is formed. Moreover,
the decay in the inferred dust temperature is slower than that expected in
kilonova models. We therefore conclude that in current models of the blue
component of the kilonova, the near-infrared component in the kilonova
accompanying GW170817 is unlikely to be due to dust.

the chemical enrichment of the universe via the r-process, the physics of short
gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves and pulsars. The rates at which these
coalescences happen is uncertain, but it can be constrained in different ways.
One of those is to search for the optical transients produced at the moment of
the merging, called a kilonova, in ongoing SN searches. However, until now,
only theoretical models for kilonovae light curve were available to estimate
their rates. The recent kilonova discovery AT~2017gfo/DLT17ck gives us the
opportunity to constrain the rate of kilonovae using the light curve of a real
event. We constrain the rate of binary neutron star mergers using the DLT40
Supernova search, and the native AT~2017gfo/DLT17ck light curve obtained with
the same telescope and software system. Excluding AT~2017gfo/DLT17ck due to
visibility issues, which was only discovered thanks to the aLIGO/aVirgo
trigger, no other similar transients detected during 13 months of daily cadence
observations of $\sim$ 2200 nearby ($<$40 Mpc) galaxies. We find that the rate
of BNS mergers is lower than 0.47 - 0.55 kilonovae per 100 years per $10^{10}$
$L_{B_{\odot}}$ (depending on the adopted extinction distribution). In volume,
this translates to $<0.99\times
10^{-4}\,_{-0.15}^{+0.19},\rm{Mpc^{-3}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$(SNe Ia-like extinction
distribution), consistent with previous BNS coalescence rates. Based on our
rate limit, and the sensitivity of aLIGO/aVirgo during O2, it is very unlikely
that kilonova events are lurking in old pointed galaxy SN search datasets.

moving with the Sun in the Galaxy since, exposed to external influences, most
prominently to the Galactic tide and passing field stars. Theories suggest that
other stars might posses exocomets distributed similarly to our OC. We study
the erosion of the OC and the possibility for capturing exocomets during the
encounters with such field stars. We carry out simulations of flybys, where
both stars are surrounded by a cloud of comets. We measure how many exocomets
are transferred to the OC, how many OC's comets are lost, and how this depends
on the other star's mass, velocity and impact parameter. Exocomets are
transferred to the OC only during relatively slow
($\lesssim0.5\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$) and close ($\lesssim10^5\,$AU) flybys and these
are expected to be extremely rare. Assuming that all passing stars are
surrounded by a cloud of exocomets, we derive that the fraction of exocomets in
the OC has been about $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$. Finally we simulate the OC for the
whole lifetime of the Sun, taking into account the encounters and the tidal
effects. The OC has lost 25--65% of its mass, mainly due to stellar encounters,
and at most 10% (and usually much less) of its mass can be captured. However,
exocomets are often lost shortly after the encounter that delivers them, due to
the Galactic tide and consecutive encounters.

$10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$$\sim$$10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and a low on-axis

parametrization procedure for any new compound considered. To do away with
prior parametrization, we propose a combination of physics-based potentials
with machine learning (ML), coined IPML, which is transferable across small
neutral organic and biologically-relevant molecules. ML models provide
on-the-fly predictions for environment-dependent local atomic properties:
electrostatic multipole coefficients (significant error reduction compared to
previously reported), the population and decay rate of valence atomic
densities, and polarizabilities across conformations and chemical compositions
of H, C, N, and O atoms. These parameters enable accurate calculations of
intermolecular contributions---electrostatics, charge penetration, repulsion,
induction/polarization, and many-body dispersion. Unlike other potentials, this
model is transferable in its ability to handle new molecules and conformations
without explicit prior parametrization: All local atomic properties are
predicted from ML, leaving only eight global parameters---optimized once and
for all across compounds. We validate IPML on various gas-phase dimers at and
away from equilibrium separation, where we obtain mean absolute errors between
0.4 and 0.7 kcal/mol for several chemically and conformationally diverse
datasets representative of non-covalent interactions in biologically-relevant
molecules. We further focus on hydrogen-bonded complexes---essential but
challenging due to their directional nature---where datasets of DNA base pairs
and amino acids yield an extremely encouraging 1.4 kcal/mol error. Finally, and
as a first look, we consider IPML in denser systems: water clusters,
supramolecular host-guest complexes, and the benzene crystal.

thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf
(WD). This model has long been known to imply a stress to pressure ratio \alpha
~0.1 in outburst compared to \alpha ~ 0.01 in quiescence. Such an enhancement
in $\alpha$ has recently been observed in simulations of turbulent transport
driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) when convection is present,
without requiring a net magnetic flux. We independently recover this result by
carrying out PLUTO MHD simulations of vertically stratified, radiative,
shearing boxes with the thermodynamics and opacities appropriate to DN. The
results are robust against the choice of vertical boundary conditions. The
thermal equilibrium solutions found by the simulations trace the well-known
S-curve in the density-temperature plane. We confirm that the high values of
\alpha ~ 0.1 occur near the tip of the hot branch of the S-curve, where
convection is active. However, we also present thermally-stable simulations at
lower temperatures that have standard values of \alpha ~ 0.03 despite the
presence of vigorous convection. We find no simple relationship between \alpha
and the strength of the convection, as measured by the ratio of convective to
radiative flux. The cold branch is only very weakly ionized so, in the second
part of this work, we studied the impact of non-ideal MHD effects on transport.
We include resistivity in the simulations and find that the MRI-driven
transport is quenched (\alpha ~ 0) below the critical density at which the
magnetic Reynolds number R_m \leq 10^4. This is problematic as X-ray emission
observed in quiescent systems requires ongoing accretion onto the WD. We verify
that these X-rays cannot self-sustain MRI-driven turbulence by photo-ionizing
the disk and discuss possible solutions to the issue of accretion in
quiescence.

exclusively formed by the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). However,
it is still unclear which astrophysical site between core-collapse supernovae
and neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process
elements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test
these scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce
the amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have
become popular candidates, their required frequency (or rate) needs to be
consistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here we
address the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its
associated Gamma-ray burst and analyze their implication on the origin of
r-process elements. The range of NS-NS merger rate densities of 320-4740
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ provided by LIGO/Virgo is remarkably consistent with the
range required by GCE to explain the Eu abundances in the Milky Way with NS-NS
mergers, assuming the solar r-process abundance pattern for the ejecta. Under
the same assumption, this event has produced about 1-5 Earth masses of Eu, and
3-13 Earth masses of gold. When using theoretical calculations to derive Eu
yields, constraining the role of NS-NS mergers becomes more challenging because
of nuclear astrophysics uncertainties. This is the first study that directly
combines nuclear physics uncertainties with GCE calculations. If GW170817 is a
representative event, NS-NS mergers can produce Eu in sufficient amounts and
are likely to be the main r-process site.

Dark Energy and in the covariant one, for Horndeski, beyond Horndeski and
degenerate higher-order theories. The simplification is dramatic: of the three
functions describing quartic and quintic beyond Horndeski theories, only one
remains and reduces to a standard conformal coupling to the Ricci scalar for

large glitchers obtained from observations of their largest recorded event

represents another milestone in gravitational-wave astronomy. However, since
LIGO is currently not as sensitive to the merger/ringdown part of the waveform,
the possibility that such signals are produced by a black hole-neutron star
binary can not be easily ruled out without appealing to assumptions about the
underlying compact object populations. We review a few astrophysical channels
that might produce black holes below 3 $M_{\odot}$ (roughly the upper bound on
the maximum mass of a neutron star), as well as existing constraints for these
channels. We show that, due to the uncertainty in the neutron star equation of
state, it is difficult to distinguish gravitational waves from a binary neutron
star system, from those of a black hole-neutron star system with the same
component masses, assuming Advanced LIGO sensitivity. This degeneracy can be
broken by accumulating statistics from many events to better constrain the
equation of state, or by third-generation detectors with higher sensitivity to
the late spiral to post-merger signal. We also discuss the possible differences

gravitational waves from a neutron star-neutron star merger (GW170817) and the
simultaneous measurement of an optical counterpart (the gamma-ray burst GRB
170817A). The close arrival time of the gravitational and electromagnetic waves
limits the difference in speed of photons and gravitons to be less than about
one part in $10^{15}$. This has three important implications for cosmological
scalar-tensor gravity theories that are often touted as dark energy candidates
and alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM. First, for the most general scalar-tensor
theories---beyond Horndeski models---three of the five parameters appearing in
the effective theory of dark energy can now be severely constrained on
astrophysical scales; we present the results of combining the new gravity wave
results with galaxy cluster observations. Second, the combination with the lack
of strong equivalence principle violations exhibited by the supermassive black
hole in M87, constrains the quartic galileon model to be cosmologically
irrelevant. Finally, we derive a new bound on the disformal coupling to photons
that implies that such couplings are irrelevant for the cosmic evolution of the
field.

by three orders of magnitude than the weakest sGRB seen before and its spectra,
showing a hard early signal followed by a softer thermal spectrum, is unique.
We show, first, that the $\gamma$-rays must have emerged from at least mildly
relativistic outflow, implying that a relativistic jet was launched following
the merger. We then show that the observations are consistent with the
predictions of a mildly relativistic shock breakout: a minute $\gamma$-ray
energy as compared with the total energy and a rather smooth light curve with a
hard to soft evolution. We present here a novel analytic study and detailed
numerical 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamic and radiation simulations that
support the picture in which the observed $\gamma$-rays arose from a shock
breakout of a cocoon from the merger's ejecta (Kasliwal 2017). The cocoon can
be formed by either a choked jet which does not generate a sGRB (in any
direction) or by a successful jet which generates an undetected regular sGRB
along the system's axis pointing away from us. Remarkably, for the choked jet
model, the macronova signal produced by the ejecta (which is partially boosted
to high velocities by the cocoon's shock) and the radio that is produced by the
interaction of the shocked cocoon material with the surrounding matter, agree
with the observed UV/optical/IR emission and with current radio observations.
Finally, we discuss the possibility that the jet propagation within the ejecta
may photodissociate some of of the heavy elements and may affect the
composition of a fraction of ejecta and, in turn, the opacity and the early
macronova light.

this result to probe the nature of dark energy (DE), showing that a large class

consider the covariant Galileon, a cosmologically viable, well motivated

eliminate any late-universe application of these models, as well as their
Horndeski and most of their beyond Horndeski generalizations. Three
alternatives (and their combinations) emerge as the only possible scalar-tensor
DE models: 1) restricting Horndeski's action to its simplest terms, 2) applying
a conformal transformation which preserves the causal structure and 3)
compensating the different terms that modify the GW speed (to be robust, the
compensation has to be independent on the background on which GWs propagate).
Our conclusions extend to any other gravity theory predicting varying $c_g$

the inner binaries as the system undergoes coupled Lidov-Kozai (LK)
oscillations. We include short-range forces (SRF; such as those due to tidal
and rotational distortions) that control the eccentricity excitation of the
inner binary. The evolution of mutual inclination is described, a priori, by
two dimensionless parameters, $\pazocal{R}_0$, the ratio between the inner and
outer LK time-scales and $\epsilon_{SRF}$, the ratio between the SRF precession
and the inner LK precession rates. We find that the chaotic zones for the
mutual inclination depend mainly on $\pazocal{R}_0$, while $\epsilon_{SRF}$
controls mainly the range of eccentricity excitation. The mutual inclination
evolves chaotically for $1\lesssim \pazocal{R}_0\lesssim 10$, leading to large
misalignments. For $0.4 \lesssim \pazocal{R}_0 \lesssim 0.8$, the system could
be weakly excited and produce bimodal distribution of mutual inclination
angles. Our results can be applied to exomoons-planets in stellar binaries and
Warm/Hot Jupiters in stellar triples. Such systems could develop large mutual
inclination angles if the inner binary is tight enough, and also high
eccentricities, depending of the strength of the short-range forces. Future
detections of tilted Warm/Hot Jupiters and exomoons could put our mechanism

cSFGs that host an AGN using a combination of Hubble WFC3 imaging and Chandra

$39.2^{+3.9}_{-3.6}$\% (65/166) of cSFGs at $1.4<z<3.0$ host an X-ray detected

is significant at the $6.2\sigma$ level. Our results are consistent with models
in which cSFGs are formed through a dissipative contraction that triggers a
compact starburst and concurrent growth of the central black hole. We also
discuss our findings in the context of cosmological galaxy evolution

the AGN fraction peaks precisely where energy injection is needed to reproduce
the decline in the number density of cSFGs with redshift. Our results suggest
that the first abundant population of massive, quenched galaxies emerged
directly following a phase of elevated supermassive black hole growth and
further hints at a possible connection between AGN and the rapid quenching of

other sources of neutrinos can be reduced efficiently to ~0.03 by analyzing
only ~1 s after each merger identified with gravitational-wave detectors if
Gadolinium is dissolved in the water. The contamination may be reduced further
to ~0.01 if we allow the increase of waiting time by a factor of ~1.7. The
detection of even a single neutrino can pin down the energy scale of thermal

relation of gravitational waves are now securely constrained to that of
massless particles with a corresponding limit on the graviton mass of

is the transformation from observed pixel coordinates (x, y) to rectified

observed simultaneously with the science targets. The misalignment can then be
fully corrected during the rectification, without having to further resample
the data. Sky subtraction can be performed via nodding and/or modeling of the

However,
it is limited in accuracy by the well-known problem of the mass-sheet
degeneracy: too rigid assumptions on the density profile of the lens can
potentially bias the inference on cosmological parameters. I investigate the
degeneracy between the choice of the lens density profile and the inference on
the Hubble constant, focusing on double image systems. By expanding lensing
observables in terms of the local derivatives of the lens potential around the
Einstein radius, and assuming circular symmetry, I show that three degrees of
freedom in the radial direction are necessary to achieve a few percent accuracy
in the time-delay distance. Additionally, while the time delay is strongly
dependent on the second derivative of the potential, observables typically used
to constrain lens models in time-delay studies, such as image position and
radial magnification information, are mostly sensitive to the first and third
derivatives, making it very challenging to accurately determine time-delay
distances with lensing data alone. Tests on mock observations show that the
assumption of a power-law density profile results in a 5% average bias on
$H_0$, with a 6% scatter. Using a more flexible model and adding unbiased
velocity dispersion constraints allows to obtain an inference with 1% accuracy.
A power-law model can still provide 3% accuracy if velocity dispersion
measurements are used to constrain its slope. Although this work is based on
the assumption of axisymmetry, its main findings can be generalized to cases
with moderate ellipticity.

galaxy properties: stellar mass, morphology, specific star formation rate and
the history of star formation. The analysis of green valley galaxies reveals
that the physical mechanisms responsible for external quenching become more
efficient moving from the field to denser environments. We confirm previous
findings that green valley galaxies have intermediate morphologies, moreover,
we find that this appears to be independent of the environment. Regarding the
stellar mass of green valley galaxies, we find that they tend to be more
massive in the field than in denser environments. On average, green valley
galaxies account for $\sim 20\%$ of all galaxies in groups and X-ray clusters.

curve can originate in circumstellar material distributed around a single
elliptical orbit (e.g., exocomets). The expected thermal emission and
wavelength dependent dimming is derived for different orbital parameters and
geometries, including dust that is optically thick to stellar radiation, and
for a size distribution of dust with realistic optical properties. We first
consider dust distributed evenly around the orbit, then show how to derive its
uneven distribution from the optical light curve and to predict light curves at
different wavelengths. The fractional luminosity of an even distribution is
approximately the level of dimming times stellar radius divided by distance
from the star at transit. Non-detection of dust thermal emission for KIC8462852
thus provides a lower limit on the transit distance to complement the 0.6au
upper limit imposed by 0.4day dips. Unless the dust distribution is optically
thick, the putative 16% century-long secular dimming must have disappeared
before the WISE 12micron measurement in 2010, and subsequent 4.5micron
observations require transits at >0.05au. However, self-absorption of thermal
emission removes these constraints for opaque dust distributions. The passage
of dust clumps through pericentre is predicted to cause infrared brightening
lasting 10s of days and dimming during transit, such that total flux received
decreases at wavelengths <5micron, but increases to potentially detectable
levels at longer wavelengths. We suggest that lower dimming levels than seen
for KIC8462852 are more common in the Galactic population and may be detected
in future transit surveys.

multi-messenger astronomy. Given the slew of papers appearing on this event, I
thought it useful to summarize the EM discoveries in the context of theoretical
models and present my views on the major take-away lessons from this watershed
event. The weak GRB discovered in close time coincidence with GW170817, and
potential evidence for a more powerful off-axis relativistic jet (initially
beamed away from our line of sight) from the delayed rise of a non-thermal
X-ray and radio orphan afterglow, provides the most compelling evidence yet
that cosmological short GRBs originate from binary NS mergers. The luminosity
and colors of the early optical emission discovered within a day of the merger
agrees strikingly well with original predictions (Metzger et al. 2010) for
""kilonova"" emission powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei, the
NS merger origin of which was initially proposed by Lattimer & Schramm 1974.
The transition of the spectral energy distribution to NIR wavelengths on
timescales of days matches predictions by Barnes & Kasen 2013 and Tanaka &
Hotokezaka 2013 if a portion of the ejecta contains heavy r-process nuclei with
higher opacities. The ""blue"" and ""red"" ejecta components may possess distinct
origins (e.g. dynamical ejecta versus accretion disk outflows), with key

non-cosmological galaxies, we investigate how cooling, star formation, and
stellar feedback affect galactic magnetic fields. We find that the
amplification histories, saturation values, and morphologies of the magnetic
fields vary considerably depending on the baryonic physics employed, primarily
because of differences in the gas density distribution. In particular,
adiabatic runs and runs with a sub-grid (effective equation of state) stellar
feedback model yield lower saturation values and morphologies that exhibit
greater large-scale order compared with runs that adopt explicit stellar
feedback and runs with cooling and star formation but no feedback. The
discrepancies mostly lie in gas denser than the galactic average, which
requires cooling and explicit fragmentation to capture. Independent of the
baryonic physics included, the magnetic field strength scales with gas density
as $B\propto n^{2/3}$, suggesting isotropic flux freezing or equipartition
between the magnetic and gravitational energies during the field amplification.
We conclude that accurate treatments of cooling, star formation, and stellar
feedback are crucial for obtaining the correct magnetic field strength and
morphology in dense gas, which, in turn, is essential for properly modeling
other physical processes that depend on the magnetic field, such as cosmic ray
feedback.

both regular and chaotic regimes. Our analysis is based on the survival
probability. Within the regular regime, the energy distribution of the initial
coherent states consists of quasi-harmonic sub-sequences of energies with
Gaussian weights. This allows for the derivation of analytical expressions that
accurately describe the entire evolution of the survival probability, from
$t=0$ to the saturation of the dynamics. The evolution shows decaying
oscillations with a rate that depends on the anharmonicity of the spectrum and,
in the case of the Dicke model, on interference terms coming from the
simultaneous excitation of its two-degrees of freedom. As we move away from the

the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 in order to constrain the radii
$R_{\rm ns}$ and maximum mass $M_{\rm max}$ of NSs. GW170817 was followed by a
range of EM counterparts, including a weak gamma-ray burst (GRB), kilonova (KN)
emission from the radioactive decay of the merger ejecta, and X-ray/radio
emission consistent with being the synchrotron afterglow of a more powerful
off-axis jet. The type of compact remnant produced in the immediate merger
aftermath, and its predicted EM signal, depend sensitively on the high-density
NS equation of state (EOS). For a soft EOS which supports a low $M_{\rm max}$,
the merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of
shock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity $\gtrsim
10^{-2}M_{\odot}$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN. On the other
hand, if $M_{\rm max}$ is sufficiently large, then the merger product is a
rapidly-rotating supramassive NS (SMNS), which must spin-down before collapsing
into a black hole. A fraction of the enormous rotational energy necessarily
released by the SMNS during this process is transferred to the ejecta, either
into the GRB jet (energy $E_{\rm GRB}$) or the KN ejecta (energy $E_{\rm ej}$),
also inconsistent with observations. By combining the total binary mass of
GW170817 inferred from the GW signal with conservative upper limits on $E_{\rm
GRB}$ and $E_{\rm ej}$ from EM observations, we constrain the likelihood
probability of a wide-range of previously-allowed EOS. These two constraints
delineate an allowed region of the $M_{\rm max}-R_{\rm ns}$ parameter space,
which once marginalized over NS radius places an upper limit of $M_{\rm max}
\lesssim 2.17M_{\odot}$ (90\%), which is tighter or arguably less
model-dependent than other current constraints.

Assuming that
the event is a binary neutron star merger, we argue that blueness and
brightness of the light curve is the result of ejecta that contains an
substantial amount of thermal energy. To achieve this, the ejecta must be
reheated at a substantial distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to
avoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can
occur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star
has evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner
binary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because
the outer star fills its Roche lobe, a substantial fraction of the dynamical
ejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process. We
suggest that the process of mass transfer in heirarchical triples tends to form
coplanar triple systems such as PSR J0337+1715, and may provide electromagnetic
counterparts to binary black hole mergers.

of GRB 070923, GRB 080121, GRB 090417A, and GRB 111005A, however, strongly
suggests that the macronovae from neutron star mergers are significantly

neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal
accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However,
real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change
over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the
current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a
dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence
by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing
results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the
optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus
statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these
components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted
evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics
of the environment, experimenters could control the rats' accumulation
timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to
accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also
makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the
dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework
to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of
evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

between quantum theory and speculative alternatives to it. This requires one to
analyze the experimental data in a manner that does not presume the correctness
of the quantum formalism. The mathematical framework of generalized
probabilistic theories (GPTs) provides a means of doing so. We present a scheme
for determining which GPTs are consistent with a given set of experimental
data. It proceeds by performing tomography on the preparations and measurements
in a self-consistent manner, i.e., without presuming a prior characterization
of either. We illustrate the scheme by analyzing experimental data for a large
set of preparations and measurements on the polarization degree of freedom of a
single photon. We find that the smallest and largest GPT state spaces
consistent with our data are a pair of polytopes, each approximating the shape
of the Bloch Sphere and having a volume ratio of $0.977 \pm 0.001$, which
provides a quantitative bound on the scope for deviations from quantum theory.
We also demonstrate how our scheme can be used to bound the extent to which
nature might be more nonlocal than quantum theory predicts, as well as the
extent to which it might be more or less contextual. Specifically, we find that
the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality can be at most $1.3\% \pm 0.1$
greater than the quantum prediction, and the maximal violation of a particular
inequality for universal noncontextuality can not differ from the quantum
prediction by more than this factor on either side. The most significant
loophole in this sort of analysis is that the set of preparations and
measurements one implements might fail to be tomographically complete for the
system of interest.

  Observatoire de Paris",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The three gravitational wave events detected by LIGO are opening a new era
for high- energy astrophysics. Nevertheless, location of such events remain
unknown. A promising solution to the localization problem is to find an
electromagnetic (EM) counterpart of GW- generating events, such as binary
neutron star mergers (BNS). Indeed, their GW emission will be above sensitivity
threshold in the near future. BNS are also considered as short Gamma Ray Bursts
(sGRB) progenitors. However, sGRB are highly beamed. In this study, we will
therefore focus on another EM counterpart candidate: the cocoon afterglow. The
propagation of the GRB jet inside the matter ejected by the BNS produces a
cocoon. Then, similarly to the GRB afterglow, a cocoon afterglow is produced,
but with a mildly relativistic velocity. Firstly, we propose a model that gives
the full hydrodynamic evolution of the cocoon including the mildly relativistic
regime. Then we calculate the cocoon afterglow emission in X-ray, optical and
radio wavelengths. Finally, we compare the cocoon afterglow emission to the GRB
afterglow emission and conclude that the cocoon afterglow is a promising EM
counterpart.

  monolithic low-cost fiber lasers","Submitted",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel laser configuration that can output 3.5-$\mu$m nanosecond
laser pulses based on a simple and monolithic fiber structure.
Cascade-gain-switching, which converts the wavelength of nanosecond pulses from
1.55 $\mu$m to 3.5 $\mu$m by two successive gain-switching processes. Instead
of using expensive pump sources at special wavelengths and bulky active or
passive modulation elements for Q-switching or mode-locking, the cascade
gain-switching only requires the pumping of an electric-modulated 1.55-$\mu$m
pulsed laser and two continuous-wave (CW) 975-nm laser diodes. They are all
standard products for fiber optic communication applications, which can greatly
lower the cost of mid-infrared laser pulse generation. To investigate the
feasibility of this configuration, we numerically simulated the
cascade-gain-switching processes by comprehensive rate-equation models. In
single-shot regime, for stable 3.5-$\mu$m pulsed lasing, the CW 975-nm pump
should be turned on at least $\sim500$ $\mu$s ahead of the 1.55-$\mu$m pulsed
pump. It shows that the pulse width of the 1.55-$\mu$m pump has major impact on
the temporal shape of the intermediate 1.97-$\mu$m pulse while has neglected
influence on the generated 3.5-$\mu$m pulse. On the other hand, increasing the
CW pump power can significantly improve the output peak power and shorten the
pulse when the pump power is less than $\sim4$ W. In the repetitive-pulse
regime, we found the 3.5-$\mu$m pulse train can be stably outputted when the
repetition rate is $<=100$ kHz. As the repetition rate increases, the duration
of reaching the stable operation increases. When the repetition rate is large
than 100 kHz, the stable operation cannot be established because the rate of
consuming the population on the $^4I_{11/2}$ level of $Er^{3+}$ ions is faster
than the rate of building the population.

the particular class of metamaterials known as impedance matched, that is,
materials whose electric permittivity is equal to their magnetic permeability.

transformation optics to situations in which the material is not impedance
matched. In such situation, the material -or more precisely, its constitutive

related to the asymmetric transmission of the material. We apply this feature
into the design of a particularly interesting set of asymmetric materials.

the Cp(T) data for SrMn2Sb2 and BaMn2Sb2 indicate strong dynamic short-range
AFM correlations above their respective TN up to at least 900 K within a
local-moment picture, corresponding to quasi-two-dimensional magnetic behavior.
The present results and a survey of the literature for Mn pnictides with the

electronic medical records (EMRs) are significantly assisting doctors to make
better clinical decisions benefiting both patients and caregivers. Even though
the growth of EMRs is at a lighting fast speed in the era of big data, content
limitations in EMRs restrain the existed recommendation systems to reflect
relevant medical facts, such as drug-drug interactions. Many medical knowledge
graphs that contain drug-related information, such as DrugBank, may give hope
for the recommendation systems. However, the direct use of these knowledge
graphs in the systems suffers from robustness caused by the incompleteness of
the graphs. To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in graph
embedding learning techniques and propose a novel framework, called Safe
Medicine Recommendation (SMR), in this paper. Specifically, SMR first
constructs a high-quality heterogeneous graph by bridging EMRs (MIMIC-III) and
medical knowledge graphs (ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank). Then, SMR jointly
embeds diseases, medicines, patients, and their corresponding relations into a
shared lower dimensional space. Finally, SMR uses the embeddings to decompose
the medicine recommendation into a link prediction process while considering
the patient's diagnoses and adverse drug reactions. To our best knowledge, SMR
is the first to learn embeddings of a patient-disease-medicine graph for
medicine recommendation in the world. Extensive experiments on real datasets
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed framework.

to improve the spectrum utilization, but it also generates spectrum misuse
problems. One common solution to these problems is to deploy monitors to detect
misbehaviors on certain channel. However, in multi-channel CRNs, it is very
costly to deploy monitors on every channel. With a limited number of monitors,
we have to decide which channels to monitor. In addition, we need to determine
how long to monitor each channel and in which order to monitor, because
switching channels incurs costs. Moreover, the information about the misuse
behavior is not available a priori. To answer those questions, we model the
spectrum monitoring problem as an adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with
switching costs (MAB-SC), propose an effective framework, and design two online
algorithms, SpecWatch-II and SpecWatch-III, based on the same framework. To
evaluate the algorithms, we use weak regret, i.e., the performance difference
between the solution of our algorithm and optimal (fixed) solution in
hindsight, as the metric. We prove that the expected weak regret of
SpecWatch-II is O(T^{2/3}), where T is the time horizon. Whereas, the actual
weak regret of SpecWatch-III is O(T^{2/3}) with probability 1 - {\delta}, for
any {\delta} in (0, 1). Both algorithms guarantee the upper bounds matching the
lower bound of the general adversarial MAB- SC problem. Therefore, they are all
asymptotically optimal.

a fixed set of categories. One of its most important applicative fields is that
of robotics, in particular the needing of a robot to be aware of what's around
and the consequent exploitation of that information as a benefit for its tasks.
In this work we consider the problem of a robot that enters a new environment
and wants to understand visual data coming from its camera, so to extract
knowledge from them. As main novelty we want to overcome the needing of a
physical robot, as it could be expensive and unhandy, so to hopefully enhance,
speed up and ease the research in this field. That's why we propose to develop
an application for a mobile platform that wraps several deep visual recognition
tasks. First we deal with a simple Image classification, testing a model
obtained from an AlexNet trained on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. Several photo
settings are considered to better understand which factors affect most the
quality of classification. For the same purpose we are interested to integrate
the classification task with an extra module dealing with segmentation of the
object inside the image. In particular we propose a technique for extracting
the object shape and moving out all the background, so to focus the
classification only on the region occupied by the object. Another significant
task that is included is that of object discovery. Its purpose is to simulate
the situation in which the robot needs a certain object to complete one of its
activities. It starts searching for what it needs by looking around and trying
to understand the location of the object by scanning the surrounding
environment. Finally we provide a tool for dealing with the creation of
customized task-specific databases, meant to better suit to one's needing in a
particular vision task.

the contact lengths and forces by their size compared to the average length and

networks more anisotropic and removing the support, from small grains, in the

details of molecular evolutions cannot be accurately predicted even using full,
classical MD simulations. This paper provides numerical results that
demonstrate the existence of computationally efficient large-scale MD
approximations which accurately model certain large-scale properties of the
molecules: the energy, the linear and angular momenta, and other macroscopic
features of molecular motions.

states in a minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) accepting $L_m$. The
state complexity of a regularity-preserving binary operation on regular
languages is defined as the maximal state complexity of the result of the
operation where the two operands range over all languages of state complexities
$\le m$ and $\le n$, respectively. We find a tight upper bound on the state
complexity of the binary operation \emph{overlap assembly} on regular
languages. This operation was introduced by Csuhaj-Varj\'u, Petre, and Vaszil
to model the process of self-assembly of two linear DNA strands into a longer
DNA strand, provided that their ends ""overlap"". We prove that the state
complexity of the overlap assembly of languages $L_m$ and $L_n$, where $m\ge 2$

overlap assembly meets the upper bound and this bound cannot be met with
smaller alphabets. Finally, we prove that $m+n$ is a tight upper bound on the
overlap assembly of unary languages, and that there are binary languages whose
overlap assembly has exponential state complexity at least $m(2^{n-1}-2)+2$.

resolution to address questions about internal gas flows. Candidates for
driving the flows include magnetic forces, but ionization state estimates
suggest much of the gas mass decouples from magnetic fields. Thus,
hydrodynamical instabilities could play a major role. We investigate disk
dynamics under conditions typical for a T Tauri system, using global 3D
radiation hydrodynamics simulations with embedded particles and a resolution of
70 cells per scale height. Stellar irradiation heating is included with
realistic dust opacities. The disk starts in joint radiative balance and
hydrostatic equilibrium. The vertical shear instability (VSI) develops into
turbulence that persists up to at least 1600 inner orbits (143 outer orbits).
Turbulent speeds are a few percent of the local sound speed at the midplane,
increasing to 20%, or 100 m/s, in the corona. These are consistent with recent
upper limits on turbulent speeds from optically thin and thick molecular line
observations of TW Hya and HD 163296. The predominantly vertical motions
induced by the VSI efficiently lift particles upwards. Grains 0.1 and 1 mm in
size achieve scale heights greater than expected in isotropic turbulence. We
conclude that while kinematic constraints from molecular line emission do not
directly discriminate between magnetic and nonmagnetic disk models, the small
dust scale heights measured in HL Tau and HD 163296 favor turbulent magnetic
models, which reach lower ratios of the vertical kinetic energy density to the
accretion stress.

different convex relaxations by relating them to corresponding proximity

duality theory, we present an improved proximity condition under which the
Peng-Wei relaxation of k-means recovers the underlying clusters exactly. Our
proximity condition improves upon Kumar and Kannan, and is comparable to that
of Awashti and Sheffet where proximity conditions are established for
projective k-means. In addition, we provide a necessary proximity condition for
the exactness of the Peng-Wei relaxation. For the special case of equal cluster
sizes, we establish a different and completely localized proximity condition
under which the Amini-Levina relaxation yields exact clustering, thereby having
addressed an open problem by Awasthi and Sheffet in the balanced case. Our
framework is not only deterministic and model-free but also comes with a clear
geometric meaning which allows for further analysis and generalization.
Moreover, it can be conveniently applied to analyzing various data generative
models such as the stochastic ball models and Gaussian mixture models. With
this method, we improve the current minimum separation bound for the stochastic
ball models and achieve the state-of-the-art results of learning Gaussian
mixture models.

analyze a broad range of relevant information such as gene sequences,
expression profiles or metabolite footprints, to capture tumor molecular

this aim, it is common practice to analyze datasets grouped into clusters based
on clinical observations and/or molecular features. However, the identification
of specific properties of each cluster that may be effectively targeted by
therapeutic drugs still represents a challenging task. We define a method to
generate an activity score for the metabolic reactions of different clusters of
patients based on their transcriptional profile. This approach reduces the
number of variables from many genes to few reactions, by aggregating
transcriptional information associated to the same enzymatic reaction according
to gene-enzyme and enzyme-reaction rules. We also applied the methodology to a

(i) tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI), associated with
hyper-mutation and with CpG island methylation phenotype, and (ii)
microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, typically endowed with chromosomal
instability. We report some key differences in the central carbon metabolism of
the two clusters. We also show how the method can be used to describe the

temperature and pressure, based on two parameters, A and B, related to
intermolecular attraction and repulsion, respectively. Assuming small
variations from ideal-gas behavior, a closed-form solution is obtained that is
valid over a wide range of conditions. An expansion in these
molecular-interaction parameters simplifies relations for flow variables,
elucidating the role of molecular repulsion and attraction in variations from
ideal-gas behavior. Real-gas modifications in density, enthalpy, and sound
speed for a given pressure and temperature lead to variations in many basic
compressible flow configurations. Sometimes, the variations can be substantial
in quantitative or qualitative terms. The new approach is applied to
choked-nozzle flow, isentropic flow, nonlinear-wave propagation, and flow
across a shock wave, all for the real gas. Modifications are obtained for
allowable mass-flow through a choked nozzle, nozzle thrust, sonic wave speed,
Riemann invariants, Prandtl's shock relation, and the Rankine-Hugoniot
relations. Forced acoustic oscillations can show substantial augmentation of
pressure amplitudes when real-gas effects are taken into account. Shocks at
higher temperatures and pressures can have larger pressure jumps with real-gas

be used for Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation. It is shown how to obtain
parameter estimates for reducible SDEs containing both process and observation

an adverse effect already observed for sparsely permuted data is that the least
squares estimator as well as other estimators not accounting for such partial

permuted data as outliers which motivates the use of robust regression

subsequently be used to recover the permutation. A notable benefit of the

particularly replicable and the theory underlying it seems poorly constructed

Previous studies have focussed on biochemical networks with simple structure or

for timescale separation to analytically examine steady-state probabilities
away from thermodynamic equilibrium for networks of arbitrary complexity. We
also introduce a method of scaling parameters that is inspired by Hopfield's
treatment of kinetic proofreading. Scaling allows asymptotic exploration of
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We identify in this way a broad class of
complex networks and scalings for which the quantity $\sigma\ln(\mu)/P$ remains
asymptotically finite whenever accuracy improves from equilibrium, so that
$\mu_{eq}/\mu \to 0$. Scalings exist, however, even for Hopfield's original
network, for which $\sigma\ln(\mu)/P$ is asymptotically infinite, illustrating
the parametric complexity. Outside the asymptotic regime, numerical
calculations suggest that, under more restrictive parametric assumptions,
networks satisfy the bound, $\sigma\ln(\mu/\mu_{eq})/P < 1$, and we discuss the
biological implications for discrimination by ribosomes and DNA polymerase. The
methods introduced here may be more broadly useful for analysing complex

paper, a novel framework is introduced to develop coordinated multicell
beamforming (CMBF) design for wireless cellular networks powered by a smart
microgrid, where the BSs are equipped with RES harvesting devices and can
perform two-way (i.e., buying/selling) energy trading with the main grid. To
this end, new models are put forth to account for the stochastic RES
harvesting, two-way energy trading, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based
energy transaction cost. Capitalizing on these models, we propose a distributed
CMBF solution to minimize the grid-wide transaction cost subject to user
quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Specifically, relying on state-of-the-art
optimization tools, we show that the relevant task can be formulated as a
convex problem that is well suited for development of a distributed solver. To
cope with stochastic availability of the RES, the stochastic alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then leveraged to develop a novel
distributed CMBF scheme. It is established that the proposed scheme is
guaranteed to yield the optimal CMBF solution, with only local channel state
information available at each BS and limited information exchange among the
BSs. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the merits of the proposed
scheme.

penetration of the liquid electrolyte into the boundaries, consequently
eliminating the detrimental factors that include solid-liquid interfacial
reaction, intergranular cracking, and layer to spinel phase transformation. The
present work, for the first time, reveals unprecedented insight as how the

provably approach the Boltzmann probabilities at high temperature, in the sense

  Methods: We implemented a CEST-MRF method to quantify the chemical exchange
rate and volume fraction of the N${\alpha}$-amine protons of L-arginine (L-Arg)
phantoms and the amide and semi-solid exchangeable protons of in vivo rat brain
tissue. L-Arg phantoms were made with different concentrations (25-100 mM) and
pH (pH 4-6). The MRF acquisition schedule varied the saturation power randomly
for 30 iterations (phantom: 0-6 ${\mu}$T; in vivo: 0-4 ${\mu}$T) with a total
acquisition time of <=2 minutes. The signal trajectories were pattern-matched
to a large dictionary of signal trajectories simulated using the
Bloch-McConnell equations for different combinations of exchange rate,
exchangeable proton volume fraction, and water T1 and T2* relaxation times.
  Results: The chemical exchange rates of the N${\alpha}$-amine protons of
L-Arg were significantly (p<0.0001) correlated with the rates measured with the
Quantitation of Exchange using Saturation Power method. Similarly, the L-Arg
concentrations determined using MRF were significantly (p<0.0001) correlated
with the known concentrations. The pH dependence of the exchange rate was well
fit (R2=0.9186) by a base catalyzed exchange model. The amide proton exchange
rate measured in rat brain cortex (36.3+-12.9 Hz) was in good agreement with
that measured previously with the Water Exchange spectroscopy method (28.6+-7.4
Hz). The semi-solid proton volume fraction was elevated in white (11.2+-1.7%)
compared to gray (7.6+-1.8%) matter brain regions in agreement with previous
magnetization transfer studies.
  Conclusion: CEST-MRF provides a method for fast, quantitative CEST imaging.

psychology, politics, marketing, sports, etc. In this problem, a decision maker
is responsible for ranking $K$ items by sequentially collecting pairwise noisy
comparison from judges. The decision maker needs to choose a pair of items for
comparison in each step, decide when to stop data collection, and make a final
decision after stopping, based on a sequential flow of information. Due to the
complex ranking structure, existing sequential analysis methods are not
suitable.
  In this paper, we formulate the problem under a Bayesian decision framework

procedures achieve asymptotic optimality by seeking for a balance between
exploration (i.e. finding the most indistinguishable pair of items) and
exploitation (i.e. comparing the most indistinguishable pair based on the
current information). New analytical tools are developed for proving the
asymptotic results, combining advanced change of measure techniques for
handling the level crossing of likelihood ratios and classic large deviation
results for martingales, which are of separate theoretical interest in solving

We show that both bond-centred (i.e. intersite) solitons are unstable

depends on the coupling and gain-loss coefficient. The threshold is lowest when

otherwise. The instability growth rate of solitons with small amplitude is
exponentially small in this parameter regime; hence the small-amplitude

external document-that are attached to or included inline in the body of the
message. Analysis of an enterprise email corpus reveals that 35% of the time
when users include these items as part of their response, the attachable item
is already present in their inbox or sent folder. A modern email client can
proactively retrieve relevant attachable items from the user's past emails
based on the context of the current conversation, and recommend them for
inclusion, to reduce the time and effort involved in composing the response. In
this paper, we propose a weakly supervised learning framework for recommending
attachable items to the user. As email search systems are commonly available,
we constrain the recommendation task to formulating effective search queries
from the context of the conversations. The query is submitted to an existing IR
system to retrieve relevant items for attachment. We also present a novel
strategy for generating labels from an email corpus---without the need for
manual annotations---that can be used to train and evaluate the query
formulation model. In addition, we describe a deep convolutional neural network
that demonstrates satisfactory performance on this query formulation task when
evaluated on the publicly available Avocado dataset and a proprietary dataset
of internal emails obtained through an employee participation program.

attack computer systems, but targets the user who works on that system by
relying on the vulnerability of their decision-making ability. Phishing attacks
can be used to gather sensitive information from victims and can have
devastating impact if they are successful in deceiving the user. Several
anti-phishing tools have been designed and implemented but they have been
unable to solve the problem adequately. This failure is often due to security
experts overlooking the human element and ignoring their fallibility in making
trust decisions online. In this paper, we present Phish Phinder, a serious game
designed to enhance the user's confidence in mitigating phishing attacks by
providing them with both conceptual and procedural knowledge about phishing.
The user is trained through a series of gamified challenges, designed to
educate them about important phishing related concepts, through an interactive
user interface. Key elements of the game interface were identified through an
empirical study with the aim of enhancing user interaction with the game. We
also adopted several persuasive design principles while designing Phish Phinder
to enhance phishing avoidance behaviour among users.

especially the binary neutron star (BNS) merger, is critically important for
gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, cosmology and fundamental physics. On Aug.
17, 2017, Advanced LIGO and \textit{Fermi}/GBM independently triggered the
first BNS merger, GW170817, and its high energy EM counterpart, GRB 170817A,
respectively, resulting in a global observation campaign covering gamma-ray,
X-ray, UV, optical, IR, radio as well as neutrinos. The High Energy X-ray
telescope (HE) onboard \textit{Insight}-HXMT (Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope)
is the unique high-energy gamma-ray telescope that monitored the entire GW
localization area and especially the optical counterpart (SSS17a/AT2017gfo)
with very large collection area ($\sim$1000 cm$^2$) and microsecond time
resolution in 0.2-5 MeV. In addition, \textit{Insight}-HXMT quickly implemented
a Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation to scan the GW localization area for
potential X-ray emission from the GW source. Although it did not detect any
significant high energy (0.2-5 MeV) radiation from GW170817, its observation
helped to confirm the unexpected weak and soft nature of GRB 170817A.
Meanwhile, \textit{Insight}-HXMT/HE provides one of the most stringent
constraints (~10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-6}$ erg/cm$^2$/s) for both GRB170817A and any
other possible precursor or extended emissions in 0.2-5 MeV, which help us to
better understand the properties of EM radiation from this BNS merger.
Therefore the observation of \textit{Insight}-HXMT constitutes an important
chapter in the full context of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observation
of this historical GW event.

convex set, which includes the sum of ratios problem as a special case. The sum
of quasi-convex component functions is not necessarily to be quasi-convex, and
so, this study goes beyond quasi-convex optimization. Exploiting the structure

method, in which only one component function is randomly selected to construct
the subgradient direction at each iteration. The convergence properties are
obtained in terms of function values and distances of iterates from the optimal
solution set with probability 1. The proposed incremental subgradient methods
are applied to solve the sum of ratios problem, as well as the multiple

demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method and its

security concerns on these algorithms due to the potentially severe

of existing adversarial attacks can only fool a black-box model with a low

iterative algorithms to boost adversarial attacks. By integrating the momentum
term into the iterative process for attacks, our methods can stabilize update
directions and escape from poor local maxima during the iterations, resulting
in more transferable adversarial examples. To further improve the success rates
for black-box attacks, we apply momentum iterative algorithms to an ensemble of

ability are also vulnerable to our black-box attacks. We hope that the proposed

the methods of algebraic topology have driven remarkable progress in the
qualitative study of large, noisy bodies of data over the past 15 years. A
primary tool in Topological Data Analysis [TDA] is the homological persistence
module, which leverages categorical structure to compare algebraic shape
descriptors across multiple scales of measurement. Our principle application to
computation is a novel algorithm to calculate persistent homology which, in
certain cases, improves the state of the art by several orders of magnitude.
Included are novel results in discrete, spectral, and algebraic Morse theory,
and on the strong maps of matroid theory. The defining theme throughout is
interplay between the combinatorial theory matroids and the algebraic theory of
categories. The nature of these interactions is remarkably simple, but their
consequences in homological algebra, quiver theory, and combinatorial
optimization represent new and widely open fields for interaction between the

paper, we study the allocation of fog computing resources to the IoT users in a

services. We formulate a computation offloading game to model the competition
between IoT users and allocate the limited processing power of fog nodes
efficiently. Each user aims to maximize its own quality of experience (QoE),
which reflects its satisfaction of using computing services in terms of the
reduction in computation energy and delay. Utilizing a potential game approach,
we prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium and provide an upper bound
for the price of anarchy. Since the time complexity to reach the equilibrium
increases exponentially in the number of users, we further propose a
near-optimal resource allocation mechanism and prove that in a system with $N$
IoT users, it can achieve an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in $O(N/\epsilon)$
time. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the users' QoE as well as the
equilibrium efficiency. Our results reveal that by utilizing the proposed

incrementally approximate the shortest path between start and goal states. Once
an initial solution is found, their performance can be dramatically improved by
restricting subsequent samples to regions of the state space that can
potentially improve the current solution. When the motion planning problem lies
in a Euclidean space, this region $X_{inf}$, called the informed set, can be
sampled directly. However, when planning with differential constraints in
non-Euclidean state spaces, no analytic solutions exists to sampling $X_{inf}$
directly.
  State-of-the-art approaches to sampling $X_{inf}$ in such domains such as
Hierarchical Rejection Sampling (HRS) may still be slow in high-dimensional
state space. This may cause the planning algorithm to spend most of its time
trying to produces samples in $X_{inf}$ rather than explore it. In this paper,
we suggest an alternative approach to produce samples in the informed set
$X_{inf}$ for a wide range of settings. Our main insight is to recast this
problem as one of sampling uniformly within the sub-level-set of an implicit
non-convex function. This recasting enables us to apply Monte Carlo sampling
methods, used very effectively in the Machine Learning and Optimization
communities, to solve our problem. We show for a wide range of scenarios that
using our sampler can accelerate the convergence rate to high-quality solutions
in high-dimensional problems.

Inter-operator cooperation may hence result in loss of privacy. Fronthaul and

quantization is considered first. Then, a novel approach based on the idea of
correlating quantization noise signals across RUs of different operators is

is a key object for the study of the cosmic ray acceleration potential of
supernova remnants. We use 0.5-1 arcminute Mopra CO/CS(1-0) data in conjunction
with HI data to calculate column densities towards the HESS J1731$-$347 region.
We trace gas within at least four Galactic arms, typically tracing total
(atomic+molecular) line-of-sight H column densities of 2-3$\times$10$^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$. Assuming standard X-factor values and that most of the HI/CO
emission seen towards HESS J1731$-$347 is on the near-side of the Galaxy, X-ray
absorption column densities are consistent with HI+CO-derived column densities
foreground to, but not beyond, the Scutum-Crux Galactic arm, suggesting a
kinematic distance of $\sim$3.2 kpc for HESS J1731$-$347. At this kinematic
distance, we also find dense, infrared-dark gas traced by CS(1-0) emission
coincident with the north of HESS J1731$-$347, the nearby HII region
G353.43$-$0.37 and the nearby unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1729$-$345.
This dense gas lends weight to the idea that HESS J1729$-$345 and HESS
J1731-347 are connected, perhaps via escaping cosmic-rays.

promising electro-magnetic (EM) counterparts of Neutron Star (NS) mergers. The
afterglow emission is broadband, visible across the entire electro-magnetic
window from $\gamma$-ray to radio frequencies. The flux evolution in these
frequencies is sensitive to the multi-dimensional afterglow physical parameter
space. Observations of gravitational wave (GW) from BNS mergers in spatial and
temporal coincidence with SGRB and associated afterglows can provide valuable
constraints on afterglow physics. We run simulations of GW-detected BNS events
and assuming all of them are associated with a GRB jet which also produces an
afterglow, investigate how detections or non-detections in X-ray, optical and
radio frequencies can be influenced by the parameter space. We narrow-down the
regions of afterglow parameter space for a uniform top-hat jet model which
would result in different detection scenarios. We list inferences which can be
drawn on the physics of GRB afterglows from multi-messenger astronomy with
coincident GW-EM observations.

global maximum $\,T_n^{(k)}(1)$.
  In this paper, we improve and extend earlier estimates by
Erd\H{o}s--Szeg\H{o}, Eriksson and Nikolov in several directions.
  Firstly, we show that the sequence $\,\{\tau_{n,k}\}_{n=k+2}^{\infty}$ is
monotonically decreasing in $n$, hence derive several sharp estimates, in
particular $$ \tau_{n,k} \le \begin{cases} \tau_{k+4,k} =
\frac{1}{2k+1}\,\frac{3}{k+3}\,, & n \ge k+4\, \tau_{k+6,k} = \frac{1}{2k+1}\,
(\frac{5}{k+5})^2 \beta_k\,,
  & n \ge k+6\,, \end{cases} $$ where $\beta_k < \frac{2+\sqrt{10}}{5} \approx
1.032$.
  We also obtain an upper bound which is uniform in $n$ and $k$, and that
implies in particular $$
  \tau_{n,k} \approx \big(\frac{2}{e}\big)^k, \quad n \ge k^{3/2}; \qquad
  \tau_{n,n-m} \approx \big(\frac{em}{2}\big)^{m/2} n^{-m/2}; \qquad
  \tau_{n,n/2} \approx \big(\frac{4}{\sqrt{27}}\big)^{n/2}. $$ Finally, we
derive the exact asymptotic formulae for the quantities $$ \tau_k^{*} :=
\lim_{n\to\infty}\tau_{n,k} \quad \mbox{ and }\quad \tau_m^{**} :=
\lim_{n\to\infty} n^{m/2} \tau_{n,n-m}\,, $$ which show that our upper bounds
for $\tau_{n,k}$ and $\tau_{n,n-m}$ are asymptotically correct with respect to
the exponential terms given above.

intentional attack in the large-scale Internet is a vital but challenging task.
While numerous techniques have been developed based on Internet traffic in past
years, anomaly detection for structured datasets by complex network have just
been of focus recently. In this paper, a anomaly detection method for
large-scale Internet topology is proposed by considering the changes of network
crashes. In order to quantify the dynamic changes of Internet topology, the
network path changes coefficient(NPCC) is put forward which will highlight the
Internet abnormal state after it is attacked continuously. Furthermore we
proposed the decision function which is inspired by Fibonacci Sequence to
determine whether the Internet is abnormal or not. That is the current Internet
is abnormal if its NPCC is beyond the normal domain which structured by the
previous k NPCCs of Internet topology. Finally the new Internet anomaly
detection method was tested over the topology data of three Internet anomaly
events. The results show that the detection accuracy of all events are over
97%, the detection precision of each event are 90.24%, 83.33% and 66.67%, when
k = 36. According to the experimental values of the index F_1, we found the the
better the detection performance is, the bigger the k is, and our method has
better performance for the anomaly behaviors caused by network failure than
that caused by intentional attack. Compared with traditional anomaly detection,
our work may be more simple and powerful for the government or organization in
items of detecting large-scale abnormal events.

(AMR). The advantages of this combined approach are demonstrated with
one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples of spherically
symmetric Bondi accretion, steady planar Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, and wind
accretion in Supergiant X-ray binaries. Another improvement is support for the
generic splitting of any background magnetic field. We present several tests
relevant for solar physics applications to demonstrate the advantages of field
splitting on accuracy and robustness in extremely low plasma $\beta$
environments: a static magnetic flux rope, a magnetic null-point, and magnetic
reconnection in a current sheet with either uniform or anomalous resistivity.
Our implementation for treating anisotropic thermal conduction in
multi-dimensional MHD applications is also described, which generalizes the
original slope limited symmetric scheme from 2D to 3D. We perform ring
diffusion tests that demonstrate its accuracy and robustness, and show that it
prevents the unphysical thermal flux present in traditional schemes. The
improved parallel scaling of the code is demonstrated with 3D AMR simulations
of solar coronal rain, which show satisfactory strong scaling up to 2000 cores.
Other framework improvements are also reported: the modernization and
reorganization into a library, the handling of automatic regression tests, the

sampler that exploits a set of fast alternating pseudo random (PR) signals.
Through parallel sampling branches, an MWC compresses a multiband spectrum by
mixing it with PR signals in the time domain, and acquires its sub-Nyquist
samples. Previously, the ratio of compression was fully dependent on the
specifications of PR signals. That is, to further reduce the sampling rate
without information loss, faster and longer-period PR signals were needed.
However, the implementation of such PR signal generators results in high power
consumption and large fabrication area. In this paper, we propose a novel
aliased modulated wideband converter (AMWC), which can further reduce the
sampling rate of MWC with fixed PR signals. The main idea is to induce
intentional signal aliasing at the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In
addition to the first spectral compression by the signal mixer, the intentional
aliasing compresses the mixed spectrum once again. We demonstrate that AMWC
reduces the number of sampling branches and the rate of ADC for lossless
sub-Nyquist sampling without needing to upgrade the speed or period of PR
signals. Conversely, for a given fixed number of sampling branches and sampling
rate, AMWC improves the performance of signal reconstruction.

the incident wave-field impinging on the medium or by forcing waves along
desired paths through its careful design. These two alternative strategies have
given rise to fascinating concepts such as time reversal or negative
refraction. Here, we show how these two processes are intimately linked through
the negative reflection phenomenon. A negative reflecting mirror converts a
wave of positive phase velocity into its negative counterpart and vice versa.
In this article, we experimentally demonstrate this phenomenon with elastic
waves in a 2D billiard and in a disordered plate by means of laser
interferometry. Despite the complexity of such configurations, the negatively
reflected wave field focuses back towards the initial source location, thereby
mimicking a phase conjugation operation while being a fully passive process.
The super-focusing capability of negative reflection is also highlighted in a
monochromatic regime. The negative reflection phenomenon is not restricted to
guided elastic waves since it can occur in zero-gap systems such as photonic
crystals, chiral metamaterials or graphene. Negative reflection can thus become
a tool of choice for the control of waves in all fields of wave physics.

by rich universal combinatorics. The stratification reflects the ways in which
the flow trajectories are tangent to the boundary $\partial(SM)$. Specifically,
we get lower estimates of the numbers of connected components of these

for autonomous vehicles that exploits LiDAR data, in addition to visual
information. In the proposed approach, LiDAR data is utilized to generate
region proposals by processing the three dimensional point cloud that it
provides. These candidate regions are then further processed by a
state-of-the-art CNN classifier that we have fine-tuned for pedestrian
detection. We have extensively evaluated the proposed detection process on the
KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed LiDAR space
clustering approach provides a very efficient way of generating region
proposals leading to higher recall rates and fewer misses for pedestrian
detection. This indicates that LiDAR data can provide auxiliary information for
CNN-based approaches.

unveiled strong evidence for the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions, namely, the
emergence of positive magnetoconductance only in the presence of parallel
electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic Weyl fermions of Mn$_3$Sn have a
significant technological potential, since a weak field ($\sim$ 10 mT) is
adequate for controlling the distribution of Weyl points and the large

structure at high redshift, $z\gtrsim 2$. In particular, the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope Dark Energy Experiment aims at observing LAEs at 1.9 $<z<$ 3.5 to
measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and the Redshift-Space
Distortion (RSD). However, Zheng et al. (2011) pointed out that the complicated
radiative transfer (RT) of the resonant Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line generates
an anisotropic selection bias in the LAE clustering on large scales, $s\gtrsim
10$ Mpc. This effect could potentially induce a systematic error in the BAO and
RSD measurements. Also, Croft et al. (2016) claims an observational evidence of
the effect in the Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity map, albeit statistically
insignificant. We aim at quantifying the impact of the Lyman-$\alpha$ RT on the
large-scale galaxy clustering in detail. For this purpose, we study the
correlations between the large-scale environment and the ratio of an apparent
Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity to an intrinsic one, which we call the `observed
fraction', at $2<z<6$. We apply our Lyman-$\alpha$ RT code by post-processing
the full Illustris simulations. We simply assume that the intrinsic luminosity
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is proportional to the star formation rate of
galaxies in Illustris, yielding a sufficiently large sample of LAEs to measure
the anisotropic selection bias. We find little correlations between large-scale
environment and the observed fraction induced by the RT, and hence a smaller
anisotropic selection bias than what was claimed by Zheng et al. (2011). We
argue that the anisotropy was overestimated in the previous work due to the
insufficient spatial resolution: it is important to keep the resolution such
that it resolves the high density region down to the scale of the interstellar
medium, $\sim1$ physical kpc. (abridged)

performed a seminal calculation of the GT response by using the
no-core-configuration-interaction approach rooted on multi-reference density
functional theory (DFT-NCCI). The model treats properly isospin and rotational
symmetries and can be applied to calculate both the nuclear spectra and
transition rates in atomic nuclei, irrespectively of their mass and
particle-number parity. The method is applied to compute the GT strength
distribution in selected $N\approx Z$ nuclei including the $p$-shell $^8$Li and
$^8$Be nuclei and the $sd$-shell well-deformed nucleus $^{24}$Mg. In order to
demonstrate a flexibility of the approach we present also a calculation of the
superallowed GT beta decay in doubly-magic spherical $^{100}$Sn and the
low-spin spectrum in $^{100}$In. It is demonstrated that the DFT-NCCI model is
capable to capture the GT response satisfactorily well by using relatively
small configuration space exhausting simultaneously the GT sum rule. The model,
due to its flexibility and broad range of applicability, may either serve as a
complement or even as an alternative to other theoretical approaches including
the conventional nuclear shell model.

suppresses Cherenkov losses and surface-guided light modes by enforcing a

the first few eV of the EELS spectrum. Simulations of the low loss inelastic

importance of selecting the optimal experimental convergence and collection

the IUCAA Giravali Observatory(IGO) provided a redshift value of 0.57. This
redshift was later confirmed with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data

0.57, its linear size is 2.2 Mpc. At this high redshift, only a few radio
sources are known to have such large linear size. In order to estimate the
spectral index of the bridge emission as well as the spectral age of the
source, we observed this source at L-band, 610 MHz and 325 MHz bands with the
GMRT. We present the spectral ageing analysis of the source which puts an upper
limit of 20 Myr on the spectral age. The better resolution maps presented here
as opposed to the original 150 MHz map shows evidence for a second episode of
emission. We also find that the core is detected at all four frequencies with a
spectral index of 0.85, which is steeper than normal, hence we speculate that
the core may be a compact steep spectrum source (CSS), which makes this giant
radio galaxy a candidate triple-double radio galaxy.

gravitational radiation from another class of astronomical objects, rapidly
spinning non-axisymmetric neutron stars, would constitute a new area of
gravitational wave astronomy. Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) is one of the most
promising sources of continuous gravitational radiation to be detected with
present-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo. As the sensitivity of these detectors improve in the
coming years, so will power of the search algorithms being used to find
gravitational wave signals. Those searches will still require integation over
nearly year long observational spans to detect the incredibly weak signals from
rotating neutron stars. For low mass X-ray binaries such as Sco X-1 this
difficult task is compounded by neutron star ""spin wandering"" caused by
stochastic accretion fluctuations. In this paper, we analyze X-ray data from
the RXTE satellite to infer the fluctuating torque on the neutron star in Sco
X-1. We then perform a large-scale simulation to quantify the statistical
properties of spin-wandering effects on the gravitational wave signal frequency
and phase evolution. We find that there are a broad range of expected maximum
levels of frequency wandering corresponding to maximum drifts of between 0.3-50
{\mu}Hz/sec over a year at 99% confidence. These results can be cast in terms
of the maximum allowed length of a coherent signal model neglecting
spin-wandering effects as ranging between 5-80 days. This study is designed to
guide the development and evaluation of Sco X-1 search algorithms.

$\gtrsim 20$ K and a density $\sim$$10^2$-$10^4 {\rm \ cm^{-3}}$, typically
warmer and denser than the bulk of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the Galaxy.
Bathed in the harsh radiation and particle field of the surrounding
intracluster X-ray gas, the molecular gas likely has a much higher ionization

similar to that of Galactic diffuse ($\lesssim 250 {\rm \ cm^{-3}}$)
partially-molecular clouds that emit in HCN(1-0) and HCO$^+$(1-0), we show that
the same gas traced in CO can produce the previously reported emissions in
HCN(3-2), HCO$^+$(3-2), and CN(2-1) from NGC 1275; the dominant source of
excitation for all the latter molecules is collisions with electrons. To
prevent collapse, as evidenced by the lack of star formation in the molecular
filaments, they must consist of thin strands that have cross-sectional radii
$\lesssim$0.2-2 pc if supported solely by thermal gas pressure; larger radii
are permissible if turbulence or poloidal magnetic fields provide additional
pressure support. We point out that the conditions required to relate CO
luminosities to molecular gas masses in our Galaxy are unlikely to apply in
cluster central elliptical galaxies. Rather than being virialized structures
analogous to GMCs, we propose that the molecular gas in NGC 1275 comprises
pressure-confined structures created by turbulent flows.

the dynamical behavior of the system with a core field model deriving from

complete statistical properties of the considered fields is available.
Furthermore, the method enables to provide predictions and to assess their

which evolves slowly in time and posses a very long memory of its past, and a
faster one associated with the small scale velocity field. We show that the
latter can exhibit rapid variations in localized areas. The combination of the
two regimes can predict quite well the decadal variations in length of day, but
it can also explain the discrepancies between the physically predicted and the
observed trend in these variations. Hindcast tests demonstrate that the model
is well balanced and that it can provide accurate short term predictions of a

predictions are limited by the high randomization rate of the different
velocity field scales, and after approximately 2000 years of forecast, no

Underlying this condition is a notion of weak feedback wherein instead of the
queue departure times the transmitter is informed about the instants when

under which feedback does not increase capacity. This condition is general in
that it depends on the output entropy rate of the queue but explicitly depends

technology for next generation cellular systems and Wi-Fi networks because of
its advances in providing orders-of-magnitude wider bandwidth than current
wireless networks. Economical and energy efficient analog/digial hybrid
precoding and combining transceivers have been often proposed for mmWave
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to overcome the severe
propagation loss of mmWave channels. One major shortcoming of existing
solutions lies in the assumption of infinite or high-resolution phase shifters
(PSs) to realize the analog beamformers. However, low-resolution PSs are
typically adopted in practice to reduce the hardware cost and power
consumption. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we investigate the
practical design of hybrid precoders and combiners with low-resolution PSs in
mmWave MIMO systems. In particular, we propose an iterative algorithm which
successively designs the low-resolution analog precoder and combiner pair for
each data stream, aiming at conditionally maximizing the spectral efficiency.
Then, the digital precoder and combiner are computed based on the obtained
effective baseband channel to further enhance the spectral efficiency. In an
effort to achieve an even more hardware-efficient large antenna array, we also
investigate the design of hybrid beamformers with one-bit resolution (binary)
PSs, and present a novel binary analog precoder and combiner optimization
algorithm with quadratic complexity in the number of antennas. The proposed
low-resolution hybrid beamforming design is further extended to multiuser MIMO
communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate the performance
advantages of the proposed algorithms compared to existing low-resolution
hybrid beamforming designs, particularly for the one-bit resolution PS

spectral unmixing model we have constrained the major mineral phases on the
surface of these three bodies. Our results confirm that the surface of Himalia,
Elara, and Carme are dominated by opaque materials such as those seen in
carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Our spectral modeling of NIR spectra of
Himalia and Elara confirm that their surface composition is the same and
magnetite is the dominant mineral. A comparison of the spectral shape of
Himalia with the two large main C-type asteroids, Themis (D 176 km) and Europa
(D 352 km), suggests surface composition similar to Europa. The NIR spectrum of
Carme exhibits blue slope up to 1.5 microm and is spectrally distinct from
those of Himalia and Elara. Our model suggests that it is compositionally
similar to amorphous carbon. Himalia and Elara are compositionally similar but
differ significantly from Carme. These results support the hypotheses that the
Jupiter irregular satellites are captured bodies that were subject to further
breakup events and clustered as families based on their similar physical and

functions are used, which are only dependent on the distances between input
points and thus invariant to the translations in the input space. The
optimization of the hyperparameters is commonly done by maximizing the log
marginal likelihood. This works quite well, if the distances are uniform
distributed. In the case of a locally adapted or even sparse input space, the
prediction of a test point can be worse dependent of its position. A possible
solution to this, is the usage of a non-stationary covariance function, where
the hyperparameters are calculated by a deep neural network. So that the
correlation length scales and possibly the noise variance are dependent on the
test point. Furthermore, different types of covariance functions are trained
simultaneously, so that the Gaussian process prediction is an additive overlay
of different covariance matrices. The right covariance functions combination
and its hyperparameters are learned by the deep neural network. Additional, the
Gaussian process will be able to be trained by batches or online and so it can
handle arbitrarily large data sets. We call this framework Deep Gaussian
Covariance Network (DGCP). There are also further extensions to this framework
possible, for example sequentially dependent problems like time series or the
local mixture of experts. The basic framework and some extension possibilities

thermally driven convection at a rough surface. Our measurements have been
undertaken in a very large experimental facility called the ""Barrel of
Ilmenau"". They provide a unique insight into the local transport process at the
interface between a hot solid surface and a surrounding fluid. In order to
probe the near-wall temperature field, we used a tiny micro-thermistor of 130
$\mu$m in diameter and 330 $\mu$m in length with a response time $\tau_{70}$ of
less than 150 ms. This sensor is forty times smaller than the thickness of the
boundary layer, and it permits a resolution better than the typical Kolmogorov
micro-scales that appear in our experiment. We demonstrate that the heat flux
enhancement generally observed at rough surfaces, basically results from an
increase of the local heat transfer coefficient at the top of the roughness
elements. We also shed light on the detailed mechanism of the transition in the
scaling of the global heat transfer relation $Nu\sim Ra^{\gamma}$ that has been
observed beyond a critical Ra number $Ra_c$. In turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection with rough surfaces, it already appears at $Ra_c\approx 10^{10}$

plates, it has been predicted at $Ra_c\approx 10^{14}$ [[Grossmann \& Lohse

rough surfaces to be attributed to an earlier laminar-turbulent transition of
the boundary layer at the top of the roughness elements as well as to a
modification of the temperature field in between the obstacles.

photo-detection amplitudes in the vacuum state, they do effect the statistics
of measurements involving the radiative force experienced by a point charge in
the field of the dipole. Specifically, the dispersion in the charge's momentum
is found to increase with time. This entails the possibility of obtaining
direct experimental evidence for the existence of advanced waves in physical
reality, and provides yet another signature of the quantum nature of the

been observed, allowing radius estimates of both objects. Here we investigate
possible mass regimes of the transiting system that could produce the observed
signatures and study them in the context of moon formation in the solar system,
i.e. via impacts, capture, or in-situ accretion. The radius of Kepler-1625 b
suggests it could be anything from a gas giant planet somewhat more massive
than Saturn (0.4 M_Jup) to a brown dwarf (BD) (up to 75 M_Jup) or even a
very-low-mass star (VLMS) (112 M_Jup ~ 0.11 M_sun). The proposed companion
would certainly have a planetary mass. Possible extreme scenarios range from a
highly inflated Earth-mass gas satellite to an atmosphere-free water-rock
companion of about 180 M_Ear. Furthermore, the planet-moon dynamics during the
transits suggest a total system mass of 17.6_{-12.6}^{+19.2} M_Jup. A
Neptune-mass exomoon around a giant planet or low-mass BD would not be
compatible with the common mass scaling relation of the solar system moons
about gas giants. The case of a mini-Neptune around a high-mass BD or a VLMS,
however, would be located in a similar region of the satellite-to-host mass
ratio diagram as Proxima b, the TRAPPIST-1 system, and LHS 1140 b. The capture
of a Neptune-mass object around a 10 M_Jup planet during a close binary
encounter is possible in principle. The ejected object, however, would have had
to be a super-Earth object, raising further questions of how such a system
could have formed. In summary, this exomoon candidate is barely compatible with
established moon formation theories. If it can be validated as orbiting a
super-Jovian planet, then it would pose an exquisite riddle for formation
theorists to solve.

but heralded entangled state manipulations and the storage of quantum states
while waiting for successful events. In the literature on this class of
repeaters, calculating repeater rates has typically depended on approximations
assuming sufficiently small probabilities. Here we propose an exact and
systematic approach including an algorithm based on Markov chain theory to
compute the average waiting time (and hence the transmission rates) of quantum
repeaters with arbitrary numbers of links. For up to four repeater segments, we
explicitly give the exact rate formulae for arbitrary entanglement swapping
probabilities. Starting with three segments, we explore schemes with arbitrary
(not only doubling) and dynamical (not only predetermined) connections. The
effect of finite memory times is also considered and the relative influence of
the classical communication (of heralded signals) is shown to grow
significantly for larger probabilities. Conversely, we demonstrate that for
small swapping probabilities the statistical behavior of the waiting time in a
quantum repeater cannot be characterized by its average value alone and
additional statistical quantifiers are needed. For large repeater systems, we
propose a recursive approach based on exactly but still efficiently computable
waiting times of sufficiently small sub-repeaters. This approach leads to
better lower bounds on repeater rates compared to existing schemes.

Teichm\""uller space of $S$. Their basis is enumerated by integral laminations
on $S$, which are collections of closed curves in $S$ with integer weights.
Around ten years later, a quantized version of this basis, still enumerated by

an ideal triangulation of $S$, each quantum basis element is a Laurent
polynomial in the exponential of quantum shear coordinates for edges of the

  on Bayesian optimization",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperparameter optimization aims to find the optimal hyperparameter
configuration of a machine learning model, which provides the best performance
on a validation dataset. Manual search usually leads to get stuck in a local
hyperparameter configuration, and heavily depends on human intuition and
experience. A simple alternative of manual search is random/grid search on a
space of hyperparameters, which still undergoes extensive evaluations of
validation errors in order to find its best configuration. Bayesian
optimization that is a global optimization method for black-box functions is
now popular for hyperparameter optimization, since it greatly reduces the
number of validation error evaluations required, compared to random/grid
search. Bayesian optimization generally finds the best hyperparameter
configuration from random initialization without any prior knowledge. This
motivates us to let Bayesian optimization start from the configurations that
were successful on similar datasets, which are able to remarkably minimize the
number of evaluations. In this paper, we propose deep metric learning to learn
meta-features over datasets such that the similarity over them is effectively
measured by Euclidean distance between their associated meta-features. To this
end, we introduce a Siamese network composed of deep feature and meta-feature
extractors, where deep feature extractor provides a semantic representation of
each instance in a dataset and meta-feature extractor aggregates a set of deep
features to encode a single representation over a dataset. Then, our learned
meta-features are used to select a few datasets similar to the new dataset, so
that hyperparameters in similar datasets are adopted as initializations to
warm-start Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

eigenvalue with the largest modulus $r_{\max}$ in the complex plane. The
typical and large fluctuations of $r_{\max}$ around its mean had been studied
before, and they match smoothly to the right of the mean. However, it remained
a puzzle to understand why the large and typical fluctuations to the left of
the mean did not match. In this paper, we show that there is indeed an
intermediate fluctuation regime that interpolates smoothly between the large

explicitly this ""intermediate deviation function"" (IDF) and show that it is
universal, i.e. independent of the confining potential $v(r)$ as long as it is
spherically symmetric and increases faster than $\ln r^2$ for large $r$ with an
unbounded support. If the confining potential $v(r)$ has a finite support, i.e.
becomes infinite beyond a finite radius, we show via explicit computation that
the corresponding IDF is different. Interestingly, in the borderline case where
the confining potential grows very slowly as $v(r) \sim \ln r^2$ for $r \gg 1$
with an unbounded support, the intermediate regime disappears and there is a
smooth matching between the central part and the left large deviation regime.

magnetic scale (g^2T) in the HTL perturbation theory, related to the confining
properties of the QCD is taken into account using the GZ action through a mass

introduces another scale in the system in addition to temperature.
Electromagnetic spectral properties and DPR are studied completely analytically

studied which reveals some of the intriguing properties of the medium in

autonomous vehicles. These heterogeneous sensors simultaneously capture various
physical attributes of the environment. Such multimodality and redundancy of
sensing need to be positively utilized for reliable and consistent perception

data streams are different from each other in many ways, such as temporal and
spatial resolution, data format, and geometric alignment. For the subsequent
perception algorithms to utilize the diversity offered by multimodal sensing,
the data streams need to be spatially, geometrically and temporally aligned

multiple persons in calibrated RGB-Depth camera networks. The multi-view 3D
pose of each person is computed by a central node which receives the
single-view outcomes from each camera of the network. Each single-view outcome
is computed by using a CNN for 2D pose estimation and extending the resulting
skeletons to 3D by means of the sensor depth. The proposed system is
marker-less, multi-person, independent of background and does not make any
assumption on people appearance and initial pose. The system provides real-time
outcomes, thus being perfectly suited for applications requiring user
interaction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this work with
respect to a baseline multi-view approach in different scenarios. To foster
research and applications based on this work, we released the source code in
OpenPTrack, an open source project for RGB-D people tracking.

videos in real applications are usually long, untrimmed and contain multiple
action instances. This problem requires not only recognizing action categories
but also detecting start time and end time of each action instance. Many
state-of-the-art methods adopt the ""detection by classification"" framework:
first do proposal, and then classify proposals. The main drawback of this
framework is that the boundaries of action instance proposals have been fixed
during the classification step. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Single Shot Action Detector (SSAD) network based on 1D temporal convolutional
layers to skip the proposal generation step via directly detecting action
instances in untrimmed video. On pursuit of designing a particular SSAD network
that can work effectively for temporal action detection, we empirically search
for the best network architecture of SSAD due to lacking existing models that
can be directly adopted. Moreover, we investigate into input feature types and
fusion strategies to further improve detection accuracy. We conduct extensive
experiments on two challenging datasets: THUMOS 2014 and MEXaction2. When
setting Intersection-over-Union threshold to 0.5 during evaluation, SSAD
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art systems by increasing mAP from
19.0% to 24.6% on THUMOS 2014 and from 7.4% to 11.0% on MEXaction2.

various tetra-alkoxysilanes (tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), tetraethyl

enhanced spatial homogeneity of the silica growth with decreasing alkyl-chain
length of the tetra-alkoxysilanes. In particular, by using TMOS as the
precursor, NRs can be fully encapsulated in a continuous thin ($\le$ 5 nm)
silica shell within only 1 h reaction time. Surprisingly, the thin silica shell
showed a superior shielding ability to acidic environment even compared to the
30 nm thick shell prepared by using TEOS. Our investigations suggest that the
lower steric hindrance of TMOS compared to TEOS or TPOS strongly promotes the
homogeneous growth of the silica shells while its increased hydrolysis rate
leads decreases the porosity of these shells.

sample different layers of the solar atmosphere using two different parameters

  Downlink Analysis",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increasing network densification, it has become exceedingly
difficult to provide traditional fiber backhaul access to each cell site, which
is especially true for small cell base stations (SBSs). The increasing maturity
of millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has opened up the possibility of
providing high-speed wireless backhaul to such cell sites. Since mmWave is also
suitable for access links, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) is
envisioning an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture for the fifth
generation (5G) cellular networks in which the same infrastructure and spectral
resources will be used for both access and backhaul. In this paper, we develop
an analytical framework for IAB-enabled cellular network using which we provide
an accurate characterization of its downlink rate coverage probability. Using
this, we study the performance of two backhaul bandwidth (BW) partition
strategies, (i) equal partition: when all SBSs obtain equal share of the
backhaul BW, and (ii) load-based partition: when the backhaul BW share of an
SBS is proportional to its load. Our analysis shows that depending on the
choice of the partition strategy, there exists an optimal split of access and
backhaul BW for which the rate coverage is maximized. Further, there exists a
critical volume of cell-load (total number of users) beyond which the gains
provided by the IAB-enabled network disappear and its performance converges to
that of the traditional macro-only network with no SBSs.

including monetary and fiscal policy, using a universal dynamic framework.
Central bank policies are designed for growth without excess inflation.
However, unemployment, investment, consumption, and inflation are interlinked.
Understanding dynamics is crucial to assessing the effects of policy,
especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Here we lay out a program
of research into monetary and economic dynamics and preliminary steps toward
its execution. We use principles of response theory to derive implications for
policy. We find that the current approach, which considers the overall money
supply, is insufficient to regulate economic growth. While it can achieve some
degree of control, optimizing growth also requires a fiscal policy balancing
monetary injection between two dominant loop flows, the consumption and wages
loop, and investment and returns loop. The balance arises from a composite of
government tax, entitlement, subsidy policies, corporate policies, as well as
monetary policy. We show empirically that a transition occurred in 1980 between
two regimes--an oversupply to the consumption and wages loop, to an oversupply
of the investment and returns loop. The imbalance is manifest in savings and
borrowing by consumers and investors, and in inflation. The latter increased
until 1980, and decreased subsequently, resulting in a zero rate largely
unrelated to the financial crisis. Three recessions and the financial crisis
are part of this dynamic. Optimizing growth now requires shifting the balance.
Our analysis supports advocates of greater income and / or government support
for the poor who use a larger fraction of income for consumption. This promotes
investment due to growth in demand. Otherwise, investment opportunities are
limited, capital remains uninvested, and does not contribute to growth.

convex hull of characteristic vectors of all pyramidal tours in the complete

set is the vertex set of $PYR(n)$ and edge set is the set of geometric edges or

subject to low illumination, while wet roads cause light reflection and distort
the appearance of lane and road markings. At night, color distortion occurs
under limited illumination. As a result, no benchmark dataset exists and only a
few developed algorithms work under poor weather conditions. To address this
shortcoming, we build up a lane and road marking benchmark which consists of
about 20,000 images with 17 lane and road marking classes under four different
scenarios: no rain, rain, heavy rain, and night. We train and evaluate several
versions of the proposed multi-task network and validate the importance of each
task. The resulting approach, VPGNet, can detect and classify lanes and road
markings, and predict a vanishing point with a single forward pass.

the neutrino oscillation phenomenon. Introducing a sterile state implies the
presence of a fourth mass eigenstate, global fits favour oscillation parameters
around $\sin^2({2\theta}) \approx 0.09$ and $\Delta m^2 \approx
1\,\mathrm{eV}^2$. The Stereo experiment was built to finally solve this
puzzle. It is one of the first running experiments built to search for eV
sterile neutrinos and takes data since end of 2016 at ILL Grenoble (France). At
a short baseline of 10 metres, it measures the antineutrino flux and spectrum
emitted by a compact research reactor. The segmentation of the detector in six
target cells allows for measurements of the neutrino spectrum at multiple
baselines. An active-sterile flavour oscillation could be unambiguously
detected, as it distorts the spectral shape of each cell's measurement
differently. This contribution gives an overview on the Stereo experiment,
along with details on the detector design, detection principle and the current
status of data analysis.

stars are early G type stars (with magV ~ 13) and their orbital periods are

is slightly inflated, while WASP-153b presents a significant radius anomaly.
WASP-156b, being one of the few well characterised Super-Neptunes, will help to
constrain the formation of Neptune size planets and the transition between gas
and ice giants. The estimates of the age of these three stars confirms the
tendency for some stars to have gyrochronological ages significantly lower than
their isochronal ages. We propose that high eccentricity migration could
partially explain this behaviour for stars hosting a short period planet.
Finally, these three planets also lie close to (WASP-151b and WASP-153b) or
below (WASP-156b) the upper boundary of the Neptunian desert. Their
characteristics support that the ultra-violet irradiation plays an important
role in this depletion of planets observed in the exoplanet population.

In this work, we generalize the MP theory of light for dispersive media
assuming that absorption and scattering losses are very small. Following our
previous work, we present two different approaches to the theory of light: (1)
the MP quasiparticle theory, which is derived by only using the fundamental
conservation laws and the Lorentz transformation; (2) the classical optoelastic
continuum dynamics (OCD), which is a generalization of the electrodynamics of
continuous media to include the dynamics of the medium under the influence of
optical forces. For the coupled MP state of a single photon and the medium, we
obtain the total MP momentum of the Minkowski form while the field's share of
the momentum is equal to the Abraham momentum. We also show that the
correspondence between the MP and OCD models and the conservation of momentum
at interfaces gives an unambiguous formula for the optical force. The dynamics
of the light pulse and the related MDW lead to nonequilibrium of the medium and
to relaxation of the atomic density by sound waves in the same way as for
nondispersive media. We also carry out simulations for optimal measurements of
atomic displacements related to the MDW in silicon. In the simulations, we
consider different waveguide cross-sections and optical pulse widths and
account for the breakdown threshold irradiance of materials. We also compare
the MP theory to previous theories of the momentum of light in a dispersive

because of the importance of different kinds of dynamic social networks,

statistical models for dynamic network data are deduced from random graph
theory where the networks are characterized on the node and edge level. They
are often very restrictive for applications and unscalable to high-dimensional
dynamic network data which is very common nowadays. In this paper, we take a
different perspective: The evolving sequence of networks are treated as a time
series of network matrices. We adopt a matrix factor model where the observed
surface dynamic network is assumed to be driven by a latent dynamic network
with lower dimensions. The linear relationship between the surface network and
the latent network is characterized by unknown but deterministic loading
matrices. The latent network and the corresponding loadings are estimated via
an eigenanalysis of a positive definite matrix constructed from the
auto-cross-covariances of the network times series, thus capturing the dynamics
presenting in the network. The proposed method is able to unveil the latent
dynamic structure and achieve the objective of dimension reduction. Different
from other dynamic network analytical methods that build on latent variables,
our approach imposes neither any distributional assumptions on the underlying
network nor any parametric forms on its covariance function. The latent network
is learned directly from the data with little subjective input. We applied the
proposed method to the monthly international trade flow data from 1981 to 2015.
The results unveil an interesting evolution of the latent trading network and

collected high precision deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data on the spectrum
of leading nucleon carrying a large fraction of the proton's energy. In this
paper, we have analyzed recent experimental data on the production of forward
proton and neutron in DIS at HERA in the framework of a perturbative QCD. We
propose a technique based on the fractures functions framework, and extract the
nucleon fracture functions (nucleon FFs) ${\cal M}_2^{(n/p)} (x, Q^2; x_L)$
from global QCD analysis of DIS data measured by ZEUS collaboration at HERA. We
have shown that an approach based on the fracture functions formalism allows us
phenomenologically parametrize the nucleon FFs. Considering both leading
neutron as well as leading proton production data at HERA, we present the
results for the separate parton distributions for all parton species, including
valence quark densities, the anti-quark densities, the strange sea
distribution, and the gluon distribution functions. We proposed several
parameterizations for the nucleon FFs and open the possibility of these
asymmetries. The obtained optimum set of nucleon FFs is accompanied by Hessian
uncertainty sets which allow one to propagate uncertainties to other
observables interest. The extracted results for the $t$-integrated leading
neutron $F_2^{\rm LN(3)} (x, Q^2; x_L)$ and leading proton $F_2^{\rm LP(3)} (x,
Q^2; x_L)$ structure functions are in good agreement with all data analyzed,
for a wide range of fractional momentum variable $x$ as well as the
longitudinal momentum fraction $x_L$.

delivery of empty vehicles for waiting passengers, for balancing the

space for vehicles approaching a station. Each of these tasks involves a
decision on the trip that has to be done by a selected empty vehicle from its
actual location to some determined destination. The decisions are based on a
multi-parameter function involving a set of factors and thresholds. An
important feature of the algorithm is that it does not use any central database
of passenger input (demand) and locations of free vehicles. Instead, it is
based on the local exchange of data between stations: on their states and on
the vehicles they expect. Therefore, it seems well-tailored for a distributed
implementation. The algorithm is uniform, meaning that the same basic procedure
is used for multiple tasks using a task-specific set of parameters.

metasurfaces has been addressed showing that, even in the simplest scenarios,
non-local response and excitation of auxiliary evanescent fields are required
for perfect field control. Although these solutions theoretically allow to
reflect incident plane waves into any desired direction, actual implementations
are difficult and, in most cases, require extensive numerical optimization of
the metamirror topology. In this work we introduce purely local reflective
metasurfaces for arbitrary manipulations of the power distribution of reflected
waves without excitation of any auxiliary evanescent fields. The reflected
fields of such local metamirror contain only the desired propagating waves. The
method is based on the analysis of the power flow distribution and the
adaptation of the reflector shape to the desired distribution of incident and
reflected fields. As a result, we find that these power-conformal metamirrors
can be easily implemented with conventional passive unit cells.The results can
be used for the design of reflecting surfaces with multiple functionalities and
for waves of different physical nature. In this work, we present the cases of
anomalous reflection and beam splitting, both for acoustic and electromagnetic

indication of signalling. However, estimating slippage is difficult and
requires a large number of fills to reliably detect it. Ultimately, even if
detected, it fails to capture an important element of causality between dark
fills and lit prints - a signature of information leakage. In the extreme, this
can lead to scaling back trading at a time when slippage is caused by a
competing trader consuming liquidity, and the appropriate action would be to
scale trading up -- not down -- in order to capture good prices.
  In this paper we describe a methodology aimed to address this dichotomy of
trading objectives, allowing to maximally capture available liquidity while at
the same time protecting the trader from excessive signalling. The method is
designed to profile dark liquidity in a dynamic fashion, on a per fill basis,
in contrast to historical venue analyses based on estimated slippage. This
allows for a dynamic and real-time control of the desired liquidity exposure.

  Functional Structure with Non-stationarity",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate spatio-temporal data arise more and more frequently in a wide
range of applications; however, there are relatively few general statistical
methods that can readily use that incorporate spatial, temporal and variable
dependencies simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
represent non-parametrically the linear dependence structure of a multivariate
spatio-temporal process in terms of latent common factors. The matrix structure
of observations from the multivariate spatio-temporal process is well reserved
through the matrix factor model configuration. The spatial loading functions
are estimated non-parametrically by sieve approximation and the variable
loading matrix is estimated via an eigen-analysis of a symmetric non-negative
definite matrix. Though factor decomposition along the space mode is similar to
the low-rank approximation methods in spatial statistics, the fundamental
difference is that the low-dimensional structure is completely unknown in our
setting. Additionally, our method accommodates non-stationarity over space. The
estimated loading functions facilitate spatial prediction. For temporal
forecasting, we preserve the matrix structure of observations at each time
point by utilizing the matrix autoregressive model of order one MAR(1).
Asymptotic properties of the proposed methods are established. Performance of
the proposed method is investigated on both synthetic and real datasets

discussed. The astrophysical $S$ factor computed with some of these
contributions in a three-body $\alpha+n+p$ model is in agreement with the
recent low-energy experimental data of the LUNA collaboration. This confirms
that a correct treatment of the isovector $E1$ transitions involving small
isospin-one admixtures in the wave functions should be able to provide an
explanation of the data without adjustable parameter. The exact-masses
prescription which is often used to avoid the disappearance of the $E1$ matrix

silicon ingot (5 cm to 30 cm long) be machined such that Bragg diffracting
""blades"" protrude from a common base. Leaving the interferometer blades
connected to the same base preserves Bragg plane alignment, but if the
interferometer contains crystallographic misalignments of greater than about 10
nrad between the blades, interference fringe visibility begins to suffer.
Additionally, the parallelism, thickness, and distance between the blades must
be machined to micron tolerances. Traditionally, interferometers do not exhibit
usable interference fringe visibility until 30 $\mu$m to 60 $\mu$m of machining
surface damage is chemically etched away. However, if too much material is
removed, the uneven etch rates across the interferometer cause the shape of the
crystal blades to be outside of the required tolerances. As a result, the
ultimate interference fringe visibility varies widely among neutron
interferometers that are created under similar conditions. We find that
annealing a previously etched interferometer at $800^\circ \mathrm{C}$
dramatically increased interference fringe visibility from 23 % to 90 %. The
Bragg plane misalignments were also measured before and after annealing using
neutron rocking curve interference peaks, showing that Bragg plane alignment
was improved across the interferometer after annealing. This suggests that
current interferometers with low fringe visibility may be salvageable and that
annealing may become an important step in the fabrication process of future
neutron interferometers, leading to less need for chemical etching and larger,
more exotic neutron interferometers.

  parameterized convection-dominated flows","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1709.06422",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial differential equations (PDEs) are often dependent on input quantities
which are inherently uncertain. To quantify this uncertainty, these PDEs must
be solved over a large ensemble of parameters. Even for a single realization
this can a computationally intensive process. In the case of flows governed by
the Navier-Stokes equations, an efficient method has been devised for computing
an ensemble of solutions. To further reduce the computational cost of this
method, an ensemble proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method was recently
proposed.
  The main contribution of this work is the introduction of POD spatial
filtering for ensemble-POD methods. The POD spatial filter makes possible the
construction of the Leray ensemble-POD model, which is a regularized reduced
order model for the numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows. The
Leray ensemble-POD model employs the POD spatial filter to smooth (regularize)
the convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations and greatly diminishes the
numerical inaccuracies produced by the ensemble-POD method in the numerical
simulation of convection-dominated flows. Specifically, for the numerical
simulation of a convection-dominated two-dimensional flow between two offset
cylinders, we show that the Leray ensemble-POD method yields accurate results,
whereas the ensemble-POD is highly inaccurate.
  The second contribution of this work is a new numerical discretization of the
variable viscosity ensemble algorithm in which the average viscosity is
replaced with the maximum viscosity. It is shown that this new numerical
discretization is significantly more stable than those in current use.
Furthermore, error estimates for the novel Leray ensemble-POD algorithm with
this new numerical discretization are also proven.

ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunctions, and prevent neuron-to-neuron
transmission of {\alpha}-syn pathology induced by {\alpha}-syn preformed

comparing methods of pulse rate estimation using imaging photoplethysmography
(iPPG). Approach: first we reveal essential steps of pulse rate estimation from
facial video and review methods applied at each of the steps. Then we
investigate performance of these methods for DEAP dataset
www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/ containing facial videos and reference
contact photoplethysmograms. Main results: best assessment precision is
achieved when pulse rate is estimated using continuous wavelet transform from
iPPG extracted by the POS method (overall mean absolute error below 2 heart
beats per minute). Significance: we provide a generic framework for theoretical
comparison of methods for pulse rate estimation from iPPG and report results
for the most popular methods on a publicly available dataset that can be used
as a benchmark.

second-order methods have attracted much attention due to their low
computational cost in each iteration. However, these algorithms might perform
poorly especially if it is hard to approximate the Hessian well and
efficiently. As far as we know, there is no effective way to handle this
problem. In this paper, we resort to Nesterov's acceleration technique to
improve the convergence performance of a class of second-order methods called
approximate Newton. We give a theoretical analysis that Nesterov's acceleration
technique can improve the convergence performance for approximate Newton just
like for first-order methods. We accordingly propose an accelerated regularized
sub-sampled Newton. Our accelerated algorithm performs much better than the
original regularized sub-sampled Newton in experiments, which validates our
theory empirically. Besides, the accelerated regularized sub-sampled Newton has
good performance comparable to or even better than classical algorithms.

level surface of value zero, or 'nodal' surface f(x,y,z)=0, of a (real) random
function f; the interface between positive and negative regions of the
function. A physically significant local attribute at a point of a curved
surface is its Gaussian curvature (the product of its principal curvatures)
because, when integrated over the surface it gives the Euler characteristic.
Here the probability distribution for the Gaussian curvature at a random point
on the nodal surface f=0 is calculated for a statistically homogeneous
('stationary') and isotropic zero mean Gaussian random function f. Capitalizing
on the isotropy, a 'fixer' device for axes supplies the probability
distribution directly as a multiple integral. Its evaluation yields an explicit
algebraic function with a simple average. Indeed, this average Gaussian
curvature has long been known. For a non-zero level surface instead of the
nodal one, the probability distribution is not fully tractable, but is supplied
as an integral expression.

gas plume, large gas bubbles were also generated and the total gas yield
increased as In ratio was increased. It is found that destructiveness of the
passivation layer on the Ga-In alloy is critical to gas generation. The
mechanism of gas eruption can be ascribed to a galvanic interaction happens
owing to passivation film and alloy with different activity connected as

the decrease in band gap and finally enhances more gas generation. These

direction for short time scales without necessarily being biased in any
direction in the long term. One of the most appropriate mathematical tools to
study this behaviour is an agent-based velocity-jump process. In the absence of
agent-agent interaction, the mean-field continuum limit of the agent-based
model (ABM) gives rise to the well known hyperbolic telegraph equation. When
agent-agent interaction is included in the ABM, a strictly advective system of
partial differential equations (PDEs) can be derived at the population-level.
However, no diffusive limit of the ABM has been obtained from such a model.
Connecting the microscopic behaviour of the ABM to a diffusive macroscopic
description is desirable, since it allows the exploration of a wider range of
scenarios and establishes a direct connection with commonly used statistical
tools of movement analysis. In order to connect the ABM at the population-level
to a diffusive PDE at the population-level, we consider a generalisation of the
agent-based velocity-jump process on a two-dimensional lattice with three forms
of agent interaction. This generalisation allows us to take a diffusive limit
and obtain a faithful population-level description. We investigate the
properties of the model at both the individual and population-level and we
elucidate some of the models' key characteristic features. In particular, we
show an intrinsic anisotropy inherent to the models and we find evidence of a
spontaneous form of aggregation at both the micro- and macro-scales.

improve adhesion in natural fibrillar systems, such as those observed in
beetles or geckos. However, these animals also display complex structural
features in the way the contact is subdivided in a hierarchical manner. Here,
we study the influence of hierarchical fibrillar architectures on the load
distribution over the contact elements of the adhesive system, and the
corresponding delamination behaviour. We present an analytical model to derive
the load distribution in a fibrillar system, including hierarchical splitting
of contacts, i.e. a ""hierarchical shear-lag"" model that generalizes the
well-known shear-lag model used in mechanics. The influence on the detachment
process is investigated introducing a numerical procedure that allows the
derivation of the maximum delamination force as a function of the considered
geometry, including statistical variability of local adhesive energy. Our study
suggests that contact splitting generates improved adhesion only in the ideal
case of infinitely compliant contacts. In real cases, to produce efficient
adhesive performance, contact splitting needs to be coupled with hierarchical
architectures to counterbalance high load concentrations resulting from contact
unit size reduction, generating multiple delamination fronts and helping to
avoid detrimental non-uniform load distributions. We show that these results
can be summarized in a generalized adhesion scaling scheme for hierarchical
structures, proving the beneficial effect of multiple hierarchical levels. The
model can thus be used to predict the adhesive performance of hierarchical
adhesive structures, as well as the mechanical behaviour of composite materials
with hierarchical reinforcements.

of dynamical regimes, which have found various practical applications. They
also provide excellent testbeds for data analysis tools for characterizing
complex signals. Recently, several of us have analyzed experimental intensity
time-traces and quantitatively identified the onset of different dynamical
regimes, as the laser's current increases. Specifically, we identified the
onset of low-frequency fluctuations (LFFs), where the laser intensity displays
abrupt dropouts, and the onset of coherence collapse (CC), where the intensity
fluctuations are highly irregular. Here we map these regimes when both, the
laser current and the feedback strength vary. We show that the shape of the
distribution of intensity fluctuations (characterized by the standard
deviation, the skewness, and the kurtosis) allows to distinguish between noise,
LFFs, and CC, and to quantitatively determine (in spite of the gradual nature
of the transitions) the boundaries of the three regimes. Ordinal analysis of
the inter-dropout time intervals consistently identifies the three regimes
occurring in the same parameter regions as the analysis of the intensity
distribution. Simulations of the well-known time-delayed Lang-Kobayashi model
are in good qualitative agreement with the observations.

layer. As physical model, the semiclassical Boltzmann equation is assumed and
the results are based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). A crucial point
is the correct inclusion of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Two different
substrates are investigated: SiO$_2$ and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). In the
adopted model for the charge-impurities scattering, a crucial parameter is the
distance $d$ between the graphene layer and the impurities of the substrate.
Usually $d$ is considered constant. Here we assume that $d$ is a random
variable in order to take into account the roughness of the substrate and the
randomness of the location of the impurities. We confirm, where only the
low-field mobility has been investigated, that h-BN is one of the most
promising substrate also for the high-field mobility on account of the reduced
degradation of the velocity due to the remote impurities.
