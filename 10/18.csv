are analyzed with respect to the beam spatial correlations. A method for
extracting these correlations from the experimental joint photocount
distributions is suggested using a suitable statistical model that quantifies
the contribution of spatial correlations to the joint photocount distributions.
In detail, the profile of twin-beam intensity spatial cross-correlation
function is revealed from the curve that gives the genuine mean photon-pair

the detection area. Also, the principle of reducing the noise in
photon-number-resolving detection by using spatial correlations is
experimentally demonstrated.

investigated where $ \alpha$ is a constant. We get an inhomogeneous spacetime
at early stage but at the late stage of universe the inhomogeneity disappear
with suitable radial co-ordinate transformation. For the large scale factor our
model behaves like $\Lambda$CDM type which is in accord with the recent WMAP
studies. We have calculated $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial r}$ and it is found
to be negative for $\alpha > 0$ which is in agreement with the observational
analysis. A striking difference with Chaplygin gas ($ \alpha = 1$) lies in the
fact that with any suitable co-ordinate transformation our metric cannot be
reduced to the Einstein-de Sitter type of homogeneous spacetime as is possible
for the Chaplygin gas. We have also studied the effective deceleration
parameter and find that the desired feature of \emph{flip} occurs at the late
universe. It is seen that the flip time depends explicitly on $\alpha$. We also
find that flip is not synchronous occurring earlier at the outer shells, thus
offering a natural path against occurrence of wellknown shell crossing
singularity. This is unlike the Tolman-Bondi case with perfect gas where one
has to impose stringent external conditions to avoid this type of singularity.
We further observe that if we adopt separation of variables method to solve the
field equations the inhomogeneity in matter distribution disappears. The whole
situation is later discussed with the help of Raychaudhury equation and the
results compared with previous cases. This work is the generalisation of our
previous article where we have taken $\alpha =1$.

difficult when working with colors described only by three-dimensional color
space values, such as RGB. Although RGB values are sufficient to describe a
specific color sensation, they do not contain enough information to predict the
RGB color that would result from a subtractive mixture of two specified RGB
colors. Methods do exist for accurately modeling subtractive mixture, such as
the Kubelka-Munk equations, but require extensive spectrophotometric
measurements of the mixed components, making them unsuitable for many computer
graphics applications. This paper presents a strategy for modeling subtractive
color mixture given only the RGB information of the colors being mixed, written
for a general audience. The RGB colors are first transformed to generic,
representative spectral distributions, and then this spectral information is
used to perform the subtractive mixture, using the weighted
arithmetic-geometric mean. This strategy provides reasonable, representative
subtractive mixture colors with only modest computational effort and no
experimental measurements. As such, it provides a useful way to model
subtractive color mixture in computer graphics applications.

give a correct similarity measure for non-isometric cases where the metric
distortion between the models is large. Hence, they are not reliable for
correspondence matching problems when the models are not isometric. In this
paper, it is proposed a method to improve the similarity metric of spectral

descriptor into a different metric space where the Euclidean distance between
the elements directly indicates the geometric dissimilarity. We design and
train a Siamese neural network to find such an embedding, where the embedded

demonstrate our approach can significantly enhance the performance of the

the possibility of using standard sirens to constrain the value of the Hubble

significantly weaker than those recently derived by observations of Cepheid
variables, it does not require any form of cosmic distance ladder and can be

and bound to a low value $H_0=55^{+7}_{-20}$ km/s/Mpc at $68 \%$ C.L. We point
out that the non-Gaussian shape of the GW170817 bound makes lower values of the
Hubble constant in worst agreement with observations than what expected from a
Gaussian form. The inclusion of the new GW170817 Hubble constant measurement
therefore significantly reduces the allowed parameter space, improving the

scientific computing and other areas of computer science to sequentialize
multidimensional grids in a cache-efficient and parallelization-friendly way
for storage in an array. Many algorithms, for example grid-based numerical PDE
solvers, have to access all neighbor cells of each grid cell during a grid
traversal. While the array indices of neighbors can be stored in a cell, they
still have to be computed for initialization or when the grid is adaptively
refined. A fast neighbor-finding algorithm can thus significantly improve the
runtime of computations on multidimensional grids.
  In this thesis, we show how neighbors on many regular grids ordered by
space-filling curves can be found in an average-case time complexity of $O(1)$.
In general, this assumes that the local orientation (i.e. a variable of a
describing grammar) of the SFC inside the grid cell is known in advance, which
can be efficiently realized during traversals. Supported SFCs include Hilbert,
Peano and Sierpinski curves in arbitrary dimensions. We assume that integer
arithmetic operations can be performed in $O(1)$, i.e. independent of the size
of the integer. We do not deal with the case of adaptively refined grids here.
However, it appears that a generalization of the algorithm to suitable adaptive
grids is possible. To formulate the neighbor-finding algorithm and prove its
correctness and runtime properties, a modeling framework is introduced. This
framework extends the idea of vertex-labeling to a description using grammars
and matrices. With the sfcpp library, we provide a C++ implementation to render
SFCs generated by such models and automatically compute all lookup tables
needed for the neighbor-finding algorithm. Furthermore, optimized
neighbor-finding implementations for various SFCs are included for which we
provide runtime measurements.

ranging from electrochemistry to solar cells [1,2]. In recent years, NiO
attracted much attention as an antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator material for
spintronic devices [3-10]. Understanding the spin - phonon coupling in NiO is a
key to its functionalization, and enabling AF spintronics' promise of
ultra-high-speed and low-power dissipation [11,12]. However, despite its status
as an exemplary AF insulator and a benchmark material for the study of
correlated electron systems, little is known about the spin - phonon
interaction, and the associated energy dissipation channel, in NiO. In
addition, there is a long-standing controversy over the large discrepancies
between the experimental and theoretical values for the electron, phonon, and
magnon energies in NiO [13-23]. This gap in knowledge is explained by NiO
optical selection rules, high Neel temperature and dominance of the magnon band
in the visible Raman spectrum, which precludes a conventional approach for
investigating such interaction. Here we show that by using ultraviolet (UV)
Raman spectroscopy one can extract the spin - phonon coupling coefficients in
NiO. We established that unlike in other materials, the spins of Ni atoms
interact more strongly with the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons than with the
transverse optical (TO) phonons, and produce opposite effects on the phonon
energies. The peculiarities of the spin - phonon coupling are consistent with
the trends given by density functional theory calculations. The obtained
results shed light on the nature of the spin - phonon coupling in AF insulators
and may help in developing innovative spintronic devices.

Pan-STARRS1) contain enormous amounts of data for asteroid shape and spin
modelling. While lightcurve inversion is not plausible for individual targets
with scarce data, it is possible for large populations with thousands of
asteroids, where the distributions of the shape and spin characteristics of the
populations are obtainable.
  We aim to introduce a software implementation of a method that computes the
joint shape elongation p and spin latitude beta distributions for a population,
with the brightness observations given in an asteroid database. Other main
goals are to include a method for performing validity checks of the algorithm,
and a tool for a statistical comparison of populations.
  The LEADER software package read the brightness measurement data for a
user-defined subpopulation from a given database. The observations were used to
compute estimates of the brightness variations of the population members. A
cumulative distribution function (CDF) was constructed of these estimates. A
superposition of known analytical basis functions yielded this CDF as a
function of the (shape, spin) distribution. The joint distribution can be
reconstructed by solving a linear constrained inverse problem. To test the
validity of the method, the algorithm can be run with synthetic asteroid
models, where the shape and spin characteristics are known, and by using the
geometries taken from the examined database.
  LEADER is a fast and robust software package for solving shape and spin

investigate the material properties of Titan's organic sand particles on Titan.
The organic sand may behave distinctively compared to the quartz/basaltic sand
on terrestrial planets (Earth, Venus, Mars) due to differences in interparticle
forces. We measured the surface energy (through contact angle measurements) and
elastic modulus (through Atomic Force Microscopy, AFM) of the Titan aerosol
analog (tholin). We find the surface energy of a tholin thin film is about 70.9
mN/m and its elastic modulus is about 3.0 GPa (similar to hard polymers like
PMMA and polystyrene). For two 20 $\mu$m diameter particles, the theoretical
cohesion force is therefore 3.3 $\mu$N. We directly measured interparticle
forces for relevant materials: tholin particles are 0.8$\pm$0.6 $\mu$N, while
the interparticle cohesion between walnut shell particles (a typical model
materials for the Titan Wind Tunnel, TWT) is only 0.4$\pm$0.1 $\mu$N. The
interparticle cohesion forces are much larger for tholins and presumably Titan
sand particles than materials used in the TWT. This suggests we should increase
the interparticle force in both analog experiments (TWT) and threshold models
to correctly translate the results to real Titan conditions. The strong
cohesion of tholins may also inform us how the small aerosol particles ($\sim$1
$\mu$m) in Titan's atmosphere are transformed into large sand particles
($\sim$200 $\mu$m). It may also support the cohesive sand formation mechanism
suggested by Rubin and Hesp (2009), where only unidirectional wind is needed to
form linear dunes on Titan.

accordance with the standard Rashba model. Moreover, we find no evidence of a
spin vortex around the $\bar{\mathrm{K}}$-point in the hexagonal Brillouin
zone, and thus no peculiar Rashba split around this point, something that has
been suggested by previous works. Rather the opposite, our results show that
the spin structure around $\bar{\mathrm{K}}$ can be fully understood by taking
into account the symmetry of the Brillouin zone and the intersection of spin
vortices centered around the $\bar{\Gamma}$-points in neighboring Brillouin
zones. As a result, the spin structure is consistently explained within the
standard framework of the Rashba model although the spin-polarized surface

the merger of a binary neutron-star (NS-NS) system was finally achieved
(GW$\,$170817), and was also accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart --
the short-duration GRB 170817A. It occurred in the nearby ($D\approx40\;$Mpc)
elliptical galaxy NGC$\,$4993, and showed optical, IR and UV emission from half
a day up to weeks after the event, as well as late time X-ray (at $\geq
8.9\;$days) and radio (at $\geq 16.4\;$days) emission. There was a delay of
$\Delta t \approx 1.74\;$s between the GW merger chirp signal and the
prompt-GRB emission onset, and an upper limit of $\theta_{\rm obs}<28^\circ$
was set on the viewing angle w.r.t the jet's symmetry axis from the GW signal.
In this letter we examine some of the implications of these groundbreaking
observations. The delay $\Delta t$ sets an upper limit on the prompt-GRB
emission radius, $R_\gamma\lesssim 2c\Delta t/(\theta_{\rm obs}-\theta_0)^2$,
for a jet with sharp edges at an angle $\theta_0<\theta_{\rm obs}$. GRB
170817A's relatively low isotropic equivalent $\gamma$-ray energy-output may
suggest a viewing angle slightly outside the jet's sharp edge,
$\theta_{\rm{}obs}-\theta_0\sim(0.05-0.1)(\Gamma/100)^{-1}$, but its peak
$\nu{}F_\nu$ photon energy and afterglow emission suggest instead that the jet
does not have sharp edges and the prompt emission was dominated by less
energetic material along our line of sight, at $\theta_{\rm{}obs}\gtrsim
2\theta_0$. Finally, we consider the type of remnant that is produced by the
NS-NS merger and find that a relatively long-lived ($>2\;$s) massive NS is
strongly disfavored, while a hyper-massive NS of lifetime $\sim1\;$s appears to
be somewhat favored over the direct formation of a black hole.

(2017) with the detection of three new C$_2$H$_3$CN rotational emission lines
at submillimeter frequencies. These new, high-resolution detections have

high-altitude photochemical production, poleward advection, and the subsequent
reversal of Titan's atmospheric circulation system following the recent
transition from northern to southern winter. We confirm that C$_2$H$_3$CN and
C$_2$H$_5$CN are most abundant at altitudes above 200 km. Using a 300 km step

directions. Although, the enhancement of quenching is larger in the beam

the anisotropic plasma have the same temperature as the isotropic plasma.

efficiently find numerical solutions to a group of linear, second-order
parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Particularly, the PDE models
in the group could be subject to different diffusion coefficients, initial
conditions, boundary conditions, and body forces. The proposed algorithm leads
to a single discrete system for the group with multiple right-hand-side vectors
by introducing an ensemble average of the diffusion coefficient functions and
using a new semi-implicit time integration method. The system could be solved
more efficiently than multiple linear systems with a single right-hand-side
vector. We first apply the algorithm to deterministic parabolic PDEs and derive
a rigorous error estimate that shows the scheme is first-order accurate in time
and is optimally accurate in space. We then extend it to find stochastic
solutions of parabolic PDEs with random coefficients and put forth an
ensemble-based Monte Carlo method. The effectiveness of the new approach is
demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Several numerical experiments are
presented to illustrate our theoretical results.

first gravitational wave (GW) detection of a binary neutron-star (NS-NS)

weeks after the event, as well as late time X-ray and radio emission. The early
UV, optical, and IR emission showed a quasi-thermal spectrum suggestive of
radioactive-decay powered kilonova-like emission. Comparison to kilonova models
favors the formation of a short-lived ($\sim1\;$s) hypermassive NS, which is
also supported by the $\Delta t\approx1.74\;$s delay between the GW chirp
signal and the prompt GRB onset. However, the late onset of the X-ray
(8.9$\;$days) and radio (16.4$\;$days) emission, together with the low
isotropic equivalent $\gamma$-ray energy output
($E_{\rm\gamma,iso}\approx5\times10^{46}\;$erg), strongly suggest emission from
a narrow relativistic jet viewed off-axis. Here we set up a general framework
for off-axis GRB jet afterglow emission, comparing analytic and numerical
approaches, and showing their general predictions for short-hard GRBs that
accompany binary NS mergers. The prompt GRB emission suggests a viewing angle
well outside the jet's core, and we compare the afterglow lightcurves expected
in such a case to the X-ray to radio emission from GRB 170817A. We fit an
afterglow off-axis jet model to the X-ray and radio data and find that the

measurement, we attempt to constrain the inclination by modeling the broad-band
X-ray-to-radio emission from GW170817, which is dominated by the interaction of
the jet with the environment. We update our previous analysis and we consider
the radio and X-ray data obtained at $t<40$ days since merger. We find that the
afterglow emission from GW170817 is consistent with an off-axis relativistic
jet with energy $10^{48}\,\rm{erg}<E_{k}\le 3\times 10^{50} \,\rm{erg}$
propagating into an environment with density $n\sim10^{-2}-10^{-4}
\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$, with preference for wider jets (opening angle $\theta_j=15$
deg). For these jets, our modeling indicates an off-axis angle $\theta_{\rm
obs}\sim25-50$ deg. We combine our constraints on $\theta_{\rm obs}$ with the
joint distance-inclination constraint from LIGO. Using the same $\sim 170$
km/sec peculiar velocity uncertainty assumed in A17:H0 but with an inclination
constraint from the afterglow data, we get a value of $H_0=$$74.0 \pm
\frac{11.5}{7.5}$ $\mbox{km/s/Mpc}$, which is higher than the value of
$H_0=$$70.0 \pm \frac{12.0}{8.0}$ $\mbox{km/s/Mpc}$ found in A17:H0. Further,
using a more realistic peculiar velocity uncertainty of 250 km/sec derived from
previous work, we find $H_0=$$75.5 \pm \frac{11.6}{9.6}$ km/s/Mpc for H0 from
this system. We note that this is in modestly better agreement with the local
distance ladder than the Planck CMB, though a significant such discrimination
will require $\sim 50$ such events. Future measurements at $t>100$ days of the
X-ray and radio emission will lead to tighter constraints.

essential for cluster and cosmological studies, especially for high-redshift
clusters. Weak gravitational lensing magnification is a promising and
complementary method to shear studies, that can be applied at higher redshifts.
We employed the weak lensing magnification method to calibrate the
mass-richness relation up to a redshift of 1.4. We used the Spitzer Adaptation

($0.2<z<1.4$) and optical data from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
to test whether magnification can be effectively used to constrain the mass of
high-redshift clusters. Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) selected using the $u$-band
dropout technique and their colours were used as a background sample of
sources. LBG positions were cross-correlated with the centres of the sample of
SpARCS clusters to estimate the magnification signal measured for cluster
sub-samples, binned in both redshift and richness. We detected a weak lensing
magnification signal for all bins at a detection significance of
2.6-5.5$\sigma$. In particular, the significance of the measurement for
clusters with $z>1.0$ is 4.1$\sigma$; for the entire cluster sample we obtained
an average M$_{200}$ of $1.28^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ $\times 10^{14} \,

weak lensing magnification as a viable tool for determining the average halo
masses for samples of high redshift galaxy clusters. The results also
established the success of using galaxy over-densities to select massive

robustness of the atmospheric retrieval methods employed. While extant
retrieval codes have provided significant constraints on molecular abundances

on their deviations from thermal and chemical equilibria have yet to be fully
explored. Our present work is a step in this direction. We report HyDRA, a
disequilibrium retrieval framework for thermal emission spectra of exoplanetary
atmospheres. The retrieval code uses the standard architecture of a parametric
atmospheric model coupled with Bayesian statistical inference using the Nested
Sampling algorithm. For a given dataset, the retrieved compositions and P-T
profiles are used in tandem with the GENESIS self-consistent atmospheric model
to constrain layer-by-layer deviations from chemical and radiative-convective
equilibrium in the observable atmosphere. We demonstrate HyDRA on the Hot
Jupiter WASP-43b with a high-precision emission spectrum. We retrieve an H2O
mixing ratio of log(H2O) = -3.54^{+0.82}_{-0.52}, consistent with previous
studies. We detect H2O and a combined CO/CO2 at 8-sigma significance. We find
the dayside P-T profile to be consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium
within the 1-sigma limits and with low day-night redistribution, consistent
with previous studies. The derived compositions are also consistent with
thermochemical equilibrium for the corresponding distribution of P-T profiles.
In the era of high precision and high resolution emission spectroscopy, HyDRA
provides a path to retrieve disequilibrium phenomena in exoplanetary

migrating simultaneously in the Type I regime in a protoplanetary disc.
Convergent migration naturally leads to the trapping of these planets in
mean-motion resonances. Once in resonance the planets' eccentricity grows
rapidly, and disc-planet torques cause the planets to escape resonance on a
time-scale of a few hundred orbits. The effect is more pronounced in highly
viscous discs, but operates efficiently even in inviscid discs. We attribute
this resonance-breaking to overstable librations driven by moderate
eccentricity damping, but find that this mechanism operates differently in
hydrodynamic simulations than in previous analytic calculations. Planets
escaping resonance in this manner can potentially explain the observed paucity
of resonances in Kepler multi-transiting systems, and we suggest that
simultaneous disc-driven migration remains the most plausible means of
assembling tightly-packed planetary systems.

motivated scenario where the SM and hidden sectors are connected by fermionic
mediators $\psi^{+, 0}$ that carry SM electroweak charges. The most promising
signal is the Drell-Yan production of a $\psi^\pm \bar{\psi}^0$ pair, which
forms an electrically charged vector bound state $\Upsilon^\pm$ due to the
hidden force and later undergoes resonant annihilation into $W^\pm X$. We
analyze this final state in detail in the cases where $X$ is a real scalar
$\phi$ that decays to $b\bar{b}$, or a dark photon $\gamma_d$ that decays to
dileptons. For prompt $X$ decays, we show that the corresponding signatures can
be efficiently probed by extending the existing ATLAS and CMS diboson searches
to include heavy resonance decays into BSM particles. For long-lived $X$, we
propose new searches where the requirement of a prompt hard lepton originating
from the $W$ boson ensures triggering and essentially removes any SM
backgrounds. To illustrate the potential of our results, we interpret them
within two explicit models that contain strong hidden forces and
electroweak-charged mediators, namely $\lambda$-supersymmetry (SUSY) and
non-SUSY ultraviolet extensions of the Twin Higgs model. The resonant nature of
the signals allows for the reconstruction of the mass of both $\Upsilon^\pm$
and $X$, thus providing a wealth of information about the hidden sector.

majority of the ULX population is that they are powered by stellar-mass black
holes or neutron stars accreting well above the Eddington limit. Theoretical
models of super-Eddington accretion predict existence of powerful outflows of
moderately ionised gas at mildly relativistic velocities. So far, these winds
have been found in 3 systems: NGC 1313 X-1, NGC 5408 X-1, NGC 55 ULX. In this
work, we create a sample of all ULXs with usable archival high resolution X-ray
data, with 10 sources in total, in which we aim to find more signatures of
outflows. We perform Gaussian line scans to find any narrow spectral
signatures, and physical wind model scans where possible. We tentatively
identify an outflow in NGC 5204 X-1, blueshifted to 0.34c, which produces
emission features with a total significance of at least 3$\sigma$. Next we
compare ULXs with similar hardness ratios. Holmberg IX X-1 shows absorption
features which could be associated with a photoionized outflowing absorber,
similar to that seen in NGC 1313 X-1. The spectrum of Holmberg II X-1 possesses
features similar to NGC 5408 X-1 and NGC 6946 X-1 shows O VIII rest-frame
emission. All other sources from the sample also show tentative evidence of
spectral features in their high resolution spectra. Further observations with
the XMM-Newton and Chandra gratings will place stronger constraints. Future
missions like XARM and Athena will be able to detect them at larger distances

lengths of stellar discs from $\sim$1000 morphologically late-type galaxies.
The baryonic mass-size relation is a single power-law $R_\ast \propto
M_b^{0.38}$ across $\sim$3 orders of magnitude in baryonic mass. The scatter in
size at fixed baryonic mass is nearly constant and there is essentially no
outlier. The baryonic mass-size relation provides a more fundamental
description of the structure of the discs than the stellar mass-size relation.
The slope and the scatter of the stellar mass-size relation can be understood
in the context of the baryonic mass-size relation. For gas-rich galaxies, the
stars is no longer a good tracer for the baryons. High baryonic mass, gas-rich
galaxies appear to be much larger at fixed stellar mass because most of the
baryonic content is gas. The stellar mass-size relation thus deviates from the
power law baryonic relation and the scatter increases at the low stellar mass
end. Those extremely gas-rich low-mass galaxies can be classified as Ultra
Diffuse Galaxies based on the structure.

from dwarf galaxies to match their low observed metallicities. In such shallow
potential wells, outflows may produce massive amounts of enriched halo gas
(circum-galactic medium or CGM) and pollute the intergalactic medium (IGM).
Here, we present a survey of the CGM and IGM around 18 star-forming field
dwarfs with stellar masses of $\log\,M_*/M_\odot\approx8-9$ at $z\approx0.2$.
Eight of these have CGM probed by quasar absorption spectra at projected
distances, $d$, less than the host virial radius, $R_{\rm h}$. Ten are probed
in the surrounding IGM at $d/R_{\rm h}=1-3$. The absorption measurements
include neutral hydrogen, the dominant silicon ions for diffuse cool gas
($T\sim10^4$ K; Si II, Si III, and Si IV), moderately ionized carbon (C IV),
and highly ionized oxygen (O VI). Metal absorption from the CGM of the dwarfs
is less common and $\approx4\times$ weaker compared to massive star-forming
galaxies though O VI absorption is still common. None of the dwarfs probed at
$d/R_{\rm h}=1-3$ have definitive metal-line detections. Combining the
available silicon ions, we estimate that the cool CGM of the dwarfs accounts
for only $2-6\%$ of the expected silicon budget from the yields of supernovae
associated with past star-formation. The highly ionized O VI accounts for
$\approx8\%$ of the oxygen budget. As O VI traces an ion with expected
equilibrium ion fractions of $\lesssim 0.2$, the highly ionized CGM may
represent a significant metal reservoir even for dwarfs not expected to
maintain gravitationally shock heated hot halos.

project is to better understand the origin of metal-poor stars and the
formation of dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way halo by cross-validating these
theoretical approaches. We combine GAMMA with the merger tree of the most
massive galaxy found in the hydrodynamic simulation and compare the star
formation rate, the metallicity distribution function (MDF), and the
age-metallicity relationship predicted by the two approaches. We found that the
SAM can reproduce the global trends of the hydrodynamic simulation. However,
there are degeneracies between the model parameters and more constraints (e.g.,
star formation efficiency, gas flows) need to be extracted from the simulation
to isolate the correct semi-analytic solution. Stochastic processes such as
bursty star formation histories and star formation triggered by supernova
explosions cannot be reproduced by the current version of GAMMA. Non-uniform
mixing in the galaxy's interstellar medium, coming primarily from
self-enrichment by local supernovae, causes a broadening in the MDF that can be
emulated in the SAM by convolving its predicted MDF with a Gaussian function
having a standard deviation of ~0.2 dex. We found that the most massive galaxy
in the simulation retains nearby 100% of its baryonic mass within its virial
radius, which is in agreement with what is needed in GAMMA to reproduce the
global trends of the simulation.

Application to the subhalo population found in cold dark matter simulations of
Milky Way-sized haloes shows that, while the combined force distribution is
governed by the most massive satellites, the fluctuations of the {\it tidal}

luminosities of these satellites, and find $M_{\rm V, Col~I} = -4.2\pm0.2$ for
Col I and $M_{\rm V, Tri~II} = -1.2\pm0.4$ for Tri II, with corresponding
half-light radii of $r_{\rm h, Col~I} = 117\pm17$ pc and $r_{\rm h, Tri~II} =
21\pm4$ pc. The properties of both systems are consistent with observed scaling
relations for MW dwarf galaxies. Based on archival data, we derive upper limits
on the neutral gas content of these dwarfs, and find that they lack HI, as do
the majority of observed satellites within the MW virial radius. Neither
satellite shows evidence of tidal stripping in the form of extensions or
distortions in matched-filter stellar density maps or surface density profiles.
However, the smaller Tri II system is relatively metal-rich for its luminosity
(compared to other MW satellites), possibly because it has been tidally
stripped. Through a suite of orbit simulations, we show that Tri II is
approaching pericenter of its eccentric orbit, a stage at which tidal debris is
unlikely to be seen. In addition, we find that Tri II may be on its first
infall into the MW, which helps explain its unique properties among MW dwarfs.
Further evidence that Tri II is likely an ultra-faint dwarf comes from its
stellar mass function, which is similar to those of other MW dwarfs.

to the expectation that a long-range ferromagnetic order is required for
establishing the quantum anomalous Hall state, superparamagnetic dynamics of
weakly interacting nanoscale magnetic islands is observed both in the plateau
transition regions as well as within the fully quantized C=$\pm$1 Chern
plateaus. Modulation doping of the topological insulator films is found to give
rise to significantly larger superparamagnetic islands as compared to uniform
magnetic doping, evidently leading to enhanced robustness of the quantum
anomalous Hall effect. Nonetheless, even in this more robust quantum state,
attaining full quantization of transport coefficients requires magnetic
alignment of at least 95% of the superparamagnetic islands. The
superparamagnetic order is also found within the incipient C=0 zero Hall
plateau, which may host an axion state if the top and bottom magnetic layers
are magnetized in opposite directions. In this regime, however, a significantly
lower level of island alignment is found in our samples, hindering the
formation of the axion state. Comprehension and control of superparamagnetic
dynamics is thus a key factor in apprehending the fragility of the quantum

collection of dark glueballs at lower temperatures, with a cosmological phase
transition from one form to the other. Despite being dark, the gauge fields of
the new force can connect indirectly to the Standard Model through
non-renormalizable operators. These operators will transfer energy between the
dark and visible sectors, and they allow some or all of the dark glueballs to
decay. In this work we investigate the cosmological evolution and decays of
dark glueballs in the presence of connector operators to the Standard Model.
Dark glueball decays can modify cosmological and astrophysical observables, and

report the first direct, i.e. model independent, measurements of the radial and
vertical gradients of temperature and velocity in a protoplanetary disc. The
measured disc structure is consistent with an irradiated self-similar disc
structure, where the temperature increases and the velocity decreases towards
the disc surface. We also directly map the vertical CO snow line, which is
located at about one gas scale height at radii between 150 and 300 au, with a
CO freeze-out temperature of $21\pm2$ K. In the outer disc ($> 300$ au), where
the gas surface density transitions from a power law to an exponential taper,
the velocity rotation field becomes significantly sub-Keplerian, in agreement
with the expected steeper pressure gradient. The sub-Keplerian velocities
should result in a very efficient inward migration of large dust grains,
explaining the lack of millimetre continuum emission outside of 300 au. The
sub-Keplerian motions may also be the signature of the base of an externally
irradiated photo-evaporative wind. In the same outer region, the measured CO
temperature above the snow line decreases to $\approx$ 15 K because of the
reduced gas density, which can result in a lower CO freeze-out temperature,
photo-desorption, or deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium.

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider two questions at the heart of machine learning; how can we
predict if a minimum will generalize to the test set, and why does stochastic
gradient descent find minima that generalize well? Our work responds to Zhang
et al. (2016), who showed deep neural networks can easily memorize randomly
labeled training data, despite generalizing well on real labels of the same
inputs. We show that the same phenomenon occurs in small linear models. These
observations are explained by the Bayesian evidence, which penalizes sharp
minima but is invariant to model parameterization. We also demonstrate that,
when one holds the learning rate fixed, there is an optimum batch size which
maximizes the test set accuracy. We propose that the noise introduced by small
mini-batches drives the parameters towards minima whose evidence is large.
Interpreting stochastic gradient descent as a stochastic differential equation,
we identify the ""noise scale"" $g = \epsilon (\frac{N}{B} - 1) \approx \epsilon
N/B$, where $\epsilon$ is the learning rate, $N$ the training set size and $B$
the batch size. Consequently the optimum batch size is proportional to both the

for the maximization of the quantum Fisher information in terms of the initial

investigating the Fisher information of feasible measurements we arrive at a
remarkable simple result: homodyne detection of canonical variables allows one
to achieve the ultimate quantum limit to precision under suitable, mild,

exoplanets atmospheres. From the ground, these observations are very
challenging due to the terrestrial atmosphere and its intrinsic variations, but
high-spectral resolution observations overcome this difficulty by resolving the
spectral lines and taking advantage of the different Doppler velocities of the
Earth, the host star and the exoplanet. We analyze the transmission spectrum
around the Na I doublet at 589 nm of the exoplanet WASP-69b, a hot Jupiter
orbiting a K-type star with a period of 3.868 days, and compare the analysis to
that of the well-know hot Jupiter HD 189733b. We also present the analysis of
the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for WASP-69b. Two transits of WASP-69b were
observed with the HARPS-North spectrograph (R = 115 000) at the TNG telescope.
We perform a telluric contamination subtraction based on the comparison between
the observed spectra and a telluric water model. Then, the common steps of the
differential spectroscopy are followed to extract the transmission spectrum.
The method is tested with archival transit data of the extensively studied
exoplanet HD 189733b, obtained with the HARPS-South spectrograph at ESO 3.6m
telescope, and then applied to WASP-69b data. For HD 189733b, we spectrally
resolve the Na I doublet and measure line contrasts of $0.72\pm0.05\%$ (D2) and

blueshift of ${\sim}0.04${\AA} is measured. For WASP-69b only the contrast of

detection at the $5\sigma$-level of excess absorption of $0.5\pm0.1\%$ in a
passband of $1.5${\AA}, more transits are needed to fully characterize the
lines profiles and retrieve accurate atmospheric properties.

that estimates incident neutron direction using the kinematics of neutron
scattering by hydrogen-1 nuclei in an organic scintillator. The instrument
design uses a single, nearly contiguous volume of organic scintillator that is
internally subdivided only as necessary to create optically isolated pillars.
Scintillation light emitted in a given pillar is confined to that pillar by a
combination of total internal reflection and a specular reflector applied to
the four sides of the pillar transverse to its long axis. The scintillation
light is collected at each end of the pillar using a photodetector. In this
optically segmented design, the (x, y) position of scintillation light emission
(where the x and y coordinates are transverse to the long axis of the pillars)
is estimated as the pillar's (x, y) position in the scintillator ""block"", and
the z-position (the position along the pillar's long axis) is estimated from
the amplitude and relative timing of the signals produced by the photodetectors
at each end of the pillar. For proton recoils greater than 1 MeV, we show that
the (x, y, z)-position of neutron-proton scattering can be estimated with < 1
cm root-mean-squared [RMS] error and the proton recoil energy can be estimated
with < 50 keV RMS error by fitting the photodetectors' response time history to
models of optical photon transport within the scintillator pillars. Finally, we
evaluate several alternative designs of this proposed single-volume scatter
camera made of pillars of plastic scintillator (SVSC-PiPS), studying the effect
of pillar dimensions, scintillator material, and photodetector response vs.
time. Specifically, we conclude that an SVSC-PiPS constructed using EJ-204 and
an MCP-PM will produce the most precise estimates of incident neutron direction

and marginally detect a faint third gap at 0.70""-0.73"" (~82-85 au). We explore
dust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as
models with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is
able to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity, but
fails to reproduce their depths. It, however, gives a good match with the ALMA
dust continuum image at 1.3 mm. Models with a parameterized dust size
distribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that
dust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pile-up
of millimeter grains in a dust trap and the continuous distribution of small
grains throughout the gap likely require a more efficient dust fragmentation
and dust diffusion in the dust trap. Alternatively, turbulence or charging
effects might lead to a reservoir of small grains at the surface layer that is
not affected by the dust growth and fragmentation cycle dominating the dense
disk midplane. The exploration of models shows that extracting planet
properties such as mass from observed gap profiles is highly degenerate.

However, the means by which this is done is poorly understood. We study two
abstracted ""molecular"" models for size regulation: inhibitor dilution and
initiator accumulation. We apply the models to two settings: bacteria like
Escherichia coli, that grow fully before they set a division plane and divide
into two equally sized cells, and cells that form a bud early in the cell
division cycle, confine new growth to that bud, and divide at the connection
between that bud and the mother cell, like the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In budding cells, delaying cell division until buds reach the same
size as their mother leads to very weak size control, with average cell size
and standard deviation of cell size increasing over time and saturating up to
100-fold higher than those values for cells that divide when the bud is still
substantially smaller than its mother. In budding yeast, both inhibitor
dilution or initiator accumulation models are consistent with the observation
that the daughters of diploid cells add a constant volume before they divide.
This adder behavior has also been observed in bacteria. We find that in
bacteria an inhibitor dilution model produces adder correlations that are not
robust to noise in the timing of DNA replication initiation or in the timing
from initiation of DNA replication to cell division (the C + D period). In
contrast, in bacteria an initiator accumulation model yields robust adder
correlations in the regime where noise in the timing of DNA replication
initiation is much greater than noise in the C + D period, as reported
previously [1]. In bacteria, division into two equally sized cells does not
broaden the size distribution.

of sensory signals associated with different physical features (e.g.,
orientation, pose, scale, location, and intensity) of the same perceptual
object. Object recognition and discrimination requires classifying the
manifolds in a manner that is insensitive to variability within a manifold. How
neuronal systems give rise to invariant object classification and recognition
is a fundamental problem in brain theory as well as in machine learning. Here
we study the ability of a readout network to classify objects from their
perceptual manifold representations. We develop a statistical mechanical theory
for the linear classification of manifolds with arbitrary geometry revealing a
remarkable relation to the mathematics of conic decomposition. Novel
geometrical measures of manifold radius and manifold dimension are introduced
which can explain the classification capacity for manifolds of various
geometries. The general theory is demonstrated on a number of representative
manifolds, including L2 ellipsoids prototypical of strictly convex manifolds,
L1 balls representing polytopes consisting of finite sample points, and
orientation manifolds which arise from neurons tuned to respond to a continuous
angle variable, such as object orientation. The effects of label sparsity on
the classification capacity of manifolds are elucidated, revealing a scaling
relation between label sparsity and manifold radius. Theoretical predictions
are corroborated by numerical simulations using recently developed algorithms
to compute maximum margin solutions for manifold dichotomies. Our theory and
its extensions provide a powerful and rich framework for applying statistical
mechanics of linear classification to data arising from neuronal responses to
object stimuli, as well as to artificial deep networks trained for object
recognition tasks.

combination of the singular vectors and the coefficients are computed by
solving a small set of quadratic equations generated by imposing orthonormality

Interestingly, the class confusion patterns follow a hierarchical structure
over the classes. We present visual-analytics methods to reveal and analyze
this hierarchy of similar classes in relation with CNN-internal data. We found
that this hierarchy not only dictates the confusion patterns between the

the early layers in these networks develop feature detectors that can separate
high-level groups of classes quite well, even after a few training epochs. In
contrast, the latter layers require substantially more epochs to develop
specialized feature detectors that can separate individual classes. We
demonstrate how these insights are key to significant improvement in accuracy

different contexts. On the one hand the equivalence principle in his two
formulations is the starting point of all gravitational theories; yet there is
no way to make it consistent with the non-relativistic formulation of QM.
Moreover, the evaluation of the Schr\""odinger equation for a particle in an
accelerated reference frame sheds light on a trajectory-dependent phase term
subject to proper time. On the other hand, the Bargmann theorem unmistakably
proves that the Schr\""odinger equation does not admit any superposition of
different masses if the symmetry chosen for the system is the Galilean one.
However, this is incompatible with relativity, since mass and energy are
equivalent and one can certainly superimpose different energies. Both
inconsistencies support the hypothesis that mass and proper time could be
treated as variables. In the third chapter we will describe a theory in which
the Galilean symmetry is extended by assuming particle mass and proper time as
canonically conjugated classical variables, or conjugated observables in the
quantum theory.
  The first three chapters discuss subjects illustrated in several articles of
the professor Daniel M. Greenberger, which are listed in the bibliography.
Whereas in the last chapter the results of a recent theory on QW, say a
discrete model for quantum particle evolution, will be examined. In particular,
the striking result is that, in the most natural physical interpretation of QW
dynamics, it is not possible to have a constant and invariant mass in any
manner. The long term aim of this work is indeed to study the reasons and
consequences of a theory of particles with variable mass in the context of
wider studies still in progress on QW.

thermodynamics, to show that interfacial tangential stresses in sliding
adhesive contacts does not affet at all the adhesive behavior of the system,
which then follows the classical JKR solution. Our finding explains the
experimental observation of Vorvolakos and Chaudhury in 2003, who found that
the contact area of a PDMS sphere remains constant during sliding and is in
agreement with the JKR solution, at least up to velocity of 1mm/s, and of
Carpick et al. Carpick, who observed that the friction force between a
platinum-coated atomic force microscope (AFM) tip and the surface of mica in
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) varies with load in proportion to the contact area
predicted by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR). We show that a reduction of the
contact area, experimentlly observed at higher sliding speeds, can be caused by
a reduction of the density of adhesive bonds as the velocity is increased, or
caused by the repulsive energy term associated with the stress spatial
fluctuation at the interface. This may explain why adhesion is completely
masked at relatively large sliding velocities.

molecules is through positron capture in vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR).
In this paper we investigate theoretically the effect of anharmonic terms in
the vibrational Hamiltonian on the positron annihilation rates. Such
interactions enable positron capture in VFRs associated with multiquantum
vibrational excitations, leading to enhanced annihilation. Mode coupling can
also lead to faster depopulation of VFRs, thereby reducing their contribution
to the annihlation rates. To analyze this complex picture, we use
coupled-cluster methods to calculate the anharmonic vibrational spectra and
dipole transition amplitudes for chloroform, chloroform-$d_1$,
1,1-dichloroethylene, and methanol, and use these data to compute positron
resonant annihilation rates for these molecules. Theoretical predictions are
compared with the annihilation rates measured as a function of incident
positron energy. The results demonstrate the importance of mode coupling in
both enhancement and suppression of the VFR. There is also experimental
evidence for the direct excitation of multimode VFR. Their contribution is
analyzed using a statistical approach, with an outlook towards more accurate
treatment of this phenomenon.

as environmental mapping and monitoring. Either for adverse conditions related
to the human presence or even for the need to reduce costs, it is certain that
many efforts have been made to develop robots with an increasingly high level
of autonomy. They must be capable of locomotion through dynamic environments,
without human operators or assistant systems' help. It is noted, thus, that the
form of perception and modeling of the environment becomes significantly
relevant to navigation. Among the main sensing methods are those based on
vision. Through this, it is possible to create highly-detailed models about the
environment, since many characteristics can be measured, such as texture,
color, and illumination. However, the most accurate vision-based navigation
techniques are computationally expensive to run on low-cost mobile platforms.
Therefore, the goal of this work was to develop a low-cost robot, controlled by
a Raspberry Pi, whose navigation system is based on vision. For this purpose,
the strategy used consisted in identifying obstacles via optical flow pattern
recognition. Through this signal, it is possible to infer the relative
displacement between the robot and other elements in the environment. Its
estimation was done using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, which can be executed by
the Raspberry Pi without harming its performance. Finally, an SVM based
classifier was used to identify patterns of this signal associated with
obstacles movement. The developed system was evaluated considering its
execution over an optical flow pattern dataset extracted from a real navigation
environment. In the end, it was verified that the processing frequency of the
system was superior to the others. Furthermore, its accuracy and acquisition
cost were, respectively, higher and lower than most of the cited works.

show that the performance of existing random-walk based approaches depends
strongly on the structural properties of the graph, e.g., the size of the
graph, whether the graph has a flat or upward-sloping Network Community Profile
(NCP), whether the graph is expander-like, whether the classes of interest are
more k-core-like or more peripheral, etc. For larger graphs with flat NCPs that
are strongly expander-like, existing methods lead to random walks that expand
rapidly, touching many dissimilar nodes, thereby leading to lower-quality
vector representations that are less useful for downstream tasks. Rather than
relying on global random walks or neighbors within fixed hop distances, Lasagne
exploits strongly local Approximate Personalized PageRank stationary
distributions to more precisely engineer local information into node
embeddings. This leads, in particular, to more meaningful and more useful
vector representations of nodes in poorly-structured graphs. We show that
Lasagne leads to significant improvement in downstream multi-label
classification for larger graphs with flat NCPs, that it is comparable for
smaller graphs with upward-sloping NCPs, and that is comparable to existing

coordinate to detect changes in adversary strategies and plan the best response
accordingly. Our approach first optimizes a set of stratagems that represent

the solar minimum and its application to the solar cycle prediction by the
surface flux transport (SFT) model. Methods. We measure the axial dipole moment
using the photospheric synoptic magnetogram observed by the Wilcox Solar
Observatory (WSO), the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Michelson
Doppler Imager (MDI), and the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI). We also use the surface flux transport model for the
interpretation and prediction of the observed axial dipole moment. Results. We
find that the observed axial dipole moment becomes approximately constant
during the period of several years before each cycle minimum, which we call the
axial dipole moment plateau. The cross-equatorial magnetic flux transport is
found to be small during the period, although the significant number of
sunspots are still emerging. The results indicates that the newly emerged
magnetic flux does not contributes to the build up of the axial dipole moment
near the end of each cycle. This is confirmed by showing that the time
variation of the observed axial dipole moment agrees well with that predicted
by the SFT model without introducing new emergence of magnetic flux. These
results allows us to predict the axial dipole moment in Cycle 24/25 minimum
using the SFT model without introducing new flux emergence. The predicted axial
dipole moment of Cycle 24/25 minimum is 60--80 percent of Cycle 23/24 minimum,
which suggests the amplitude of Cycle 25 even weaker than the current Cycle 24.
Conclusions. The plateau of the solar axial dipole moment is an important
feature for the longer prediction of the solar cycle based on the SFT model.

structure of the spectrum of the Koopman operator with rigorous convergence
guarantees. The method is based on the observation that, in the
measure-preserving ergodic setting, the moments of the spectral measure
associated to a given observable are computable from a single trajectory of
this observable. Having finitely many moments available, we use the classical
Christoffel-Darboux kernel to separate the atomic and absolutely continuous
parts of the spectrum, supported by convergence guarantees as the number of
moments tends to infinity. In addition, we propose a technique to detect the
singular continuous part of the spectrum as well as two methods to approximate
the spectral measure with guaranteed convergence in the weak topology,
irrespective of whether the singular continuous part is present or not. The
proposed method is simple to implement and readily applicable to large-scale
systems since the computational complexity is dominated by inverting an
$N\times N$ Hermitian positive-definite Toeplitz matrix, where $N$ is the
number of moments, for which efficient and numerically stable algorithms exist;
in particular, the complexity of the approach is independent of the dimension
of the underlying state-space. We also show how to compute, from measured data,
the spectral projection on a given segment of the unit circle, allowing us to
obtain a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator that explicitly takes
into account the point and continuous parts of the spectrum. Finally, we
describe a relationship between the proposed method and the so-called Hankel
Dynamic Mode Decomposition, providing new insights into the behavior of the

study the effects of including a sub-grid turbulent model for the diffusion of
metals in gas. Simulations that include diffusion have narrower MDFs and
abundance ratio distributions, because diffusion drives individual gas and star
particles toward the average metallicity. This effect provides significantly
better agreement with observed abundance distributions of dwarf galaxies in the
Local Group, including the small intrinsic scatter in [${\alpha}$/Fe] vs.
[Fe/H] (less than 0.1 dex). This small intrinsic scatter arises in our
simulations because the interstellar medium (ISM) in dwarf galaxies is
well-mixed at nearly all cosmic times, such that stars that form at a given
time have similar abundances to within 0.1 dex. Thus, most of the scatter in
abundances at z = 0 arises from redshift evolution and not from instantaneous
scatter in the ISM. We find similar MDF widths and intrinsic scatter for
satellite and isolated dwarf galaxies, which suggests that environmental
effects play a minor role compared with internal chemical evolution in our
simulations. Overall, with the inclusion of metal diffusion, our simulations
reproduce abundance distribution widths of observed low-mass galaxies, enabling
detailed studies of chemical evolution in galaxy formation.

responses. Furthermore, the material parameters that characterize the optical

employing an actor-critic training algorithm in which the critic is trained on
full states while the actor (or policy) gets rendered images as input. We show
experimentally on a range of simulated tasks that using these asymmetric inputs

flare-productive and how the X9.3 flare, the largest one of the last decade,
took place. We find that there was a sunspot in the initial several days, and
then two bipolar regions emerged nearby it successively. Due to the standing of
the pre-existing sunspot, the movement of the bipoles was blocked, while the
pre-existing sunspot maintained its quasi-circular shaped umbra only with the
disappearance of a part of penumbra. Thus, the bipolar patches were
significantly distorted, and the opposite polarities formed two semi-circular
shaped structures. After that, two sequences of new bipolar regions emerged
within the narrow semi-circular zone, and the bipolar patches separated along
the curved channel. The new bipoles sheared and interacted with the previous
ones, forming a complex topological system, during which numerous flares
occurred. At the highly sheared region, a great deal of free energy was
accumulated. On September 6, one negative patch near the polarity inversion
line began to rapidly rotate and shear with the surrounding positive fields,
and consequently the X9.3 flare erupted. Our results reveal that the
block-induced complex structures built the flare-productive AR and the X9.3
flare was triggered by an erupting filament due to the kink instability. To

obtained time-series spectra between 2016 February and May to derive the
fundamental parameters of the binary star and to study its evolutionary
scenario. The radial velocity (RV) curves for both components were presented,
and the effective temperature of the hotter and more massive primary was
determined to be $T_{\rm eff,1}$ = 8260 $\pm$ 210 K by comparing the
disentangling spectrum and the Kurucz models. Our RV measurements were solved
with the $BV$ light curves of Zhang et al. (2014) using the Wilson-Devinney
binary code. The absolute dimensions of each component are determined as
follows: $M_1$ = 2.03 $\pm$ 0.06 M$_\odot$, $M_2$ = 0.19 $\pm$ 0.01 M$_\odot$,
$R_1$ = 2.08 $\pm$ 0.03 R$_\odot$, $R_2$ = 1.20 $\pm$ 0.02 R$_\odot$, $L_1$ =
18 $\pm$ 2 L$_\odot$, and $L_2$ = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.2 L$_\odot$. Comparison with
stellar evolution models indicated that the primary star resides inside the
$\delta$ Sct instability strip on the main sequence, while the cool secondary
component is noticeably overluminous and oversized. We demonstrated that OO Dra
is an oscillating post-mass transfer R CMa-type binary; the originally more
massive star became the low-mass secondary component through mass loss caused
by stellar wind and mass transfer, and the gainer became the pulsating primary
as the result of mass accretion. The R CMa stars, such as OO Dra, are thought
to have formed by non-conservative binary evolution and ultimately to evolve
into EL CVn stars.

different strategies of hip, knee and ankle. The different human beings have
different push recovery capabilities. For example a wrestler has a better push

interference in ultrathin absorbing layers has been studied to realize near
perfect absorption at a specific wavelength, achieving high broadband

experimentally demonstrated a method to tune not only reflection phase shift
but also electromagnetic energy dissipation to design broadband solar absorber
with simple planar structure consisting of an ultrathin absorbing layer
separated from the metallic substrate by a transparent layer. We explicitly
identified by deriving a new formulism that the absorbing material with
refractive index proportional to the wavelength as well as extinction
coefficient independent of the wavelength, is the ideal building block to
create ultrathin planar broadband absorbers. To demonstrate the general
strategy for naturally available absorbing materials in both high-loss

the bound-electron interband transition with a broad Lorentz oscillator peak to
design a solar thermal absorber based on a ultrathin Cr layer; and leveraged
the strong exciton attributed to the spin-orbit coupling for the spectrum near
the band edge, and the bound-electron interband transition for shorter

outcome of an event can be influenced by many factors that dynamically change
across time. Oddsmakers attempt to estimate these factors by using both
algorithmic and subjective methods to set the spread. However, it is well-known
that both human and algorithmic decision-making can be biased, so this paper
explores if oddsmaker biases can be used in an exploitative manner, in order to

to train and test different predictive models under varying assumptions. The
results show that methods that leverage oddsmaker biases in an exploitative

Carlo simulation suffers from the sign problem. In order to overcome the sign
problem, the method of Lefschetz thimble has been explored. Basically, the
original sign problem can be less severe in a complexified theory due to the
constancy of the imaginary part of an action on each thimble. However, global
phase factors assigned on each thimble still remain. Their interference is not
negligible in a situation where a large number of thimbles contribute to the
partition function, and this could also lead to a sign problem.In this study,
we propose a method to resolve this problem by modifying the structure of
Lefschetz thimbles such that only a single thimble is relevant to the partition
function. It can be shown that observables measured in the original and
modified theories are connected by a simple identity. We exemplify that our
method works well in a toy model.

In this paper, we design a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Network (MSCAN) to learn

Moreover, instead of using predefined rigid parts, we propose to learn and
localize deformable pedestrian parts using Spatial Transformer Networks (STN)
with novel spatial constraints. The learned body parts can release some
difficulties, eg pose variations and background clutters, in part-based
representation. Finally, we integrate the representation learning processes of

individuals' privacy. We introduce Replacement AutoEncoder, a novel algorithm
which learns how to transform discriminative features of data that correspond
to sensitive inferences, into some features that have been more observed in
non-sensitive inferences, to protect users' privacy. This efficiency is
achieved by defining a user-customized objective function for deep
autoencoders. Our replacement method will not only eliminate the possibility of
recognizing sensitive inferences, it also eliminates the possibility of
detecting the occurrence of them. That is the main weakness of other approaches
such as filtering or randomization. We evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm
with an activity recognition task in a multi-sensing environment using
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. We show that it can retain
the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art techniques while simultaneously
preserving the privacy of sensitive information. Finally, we utilize the GANs
for detecting the occurrence of replacement, after releasing data, and show
that this can be done only if the adversarial network is trained on the users'
original data.

confirmed by finite time thermodynamic optimization results. The so-obtained

coupling feebly with the messenger fields while the messengers are still in the
thermal bath. The FIMP is the fermionic component of the pseudo-moduli in a
generic metastable supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking model and resides in the
hidden sector. The relic abundance and the mass of the FIMP are determined by
the SUSY breaking scale and the feeble coupling. The gravitino, which is the
canonical dark matter candidate in the gauge mediation framework, contributes
to the dark matter relic abundance along with the freeze-in of the FIMP. The
hidden sector thus becomes two- component with both the FIMP and gravitino
lodging in the SUSY breaking hidden sector. We point out that the ratio between
the FIMP and the gravitino is determined by how SUSY breaking is communicated
to the messengers. In particular when the FIMP dominates the hidden sector, the
gravitino becomes the minor contributor in the hidden sector. Meanwhile, the
neutralino is assumed to be both the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)
dark matter candidate in the freeze-out mechanism and the Lightest Observable
SUSY Particle (LOSP). We further find out the neutralino has the sub-leading
contribution to the current dark matter relic density in the parameter space of
our freeze-in gauge mediation (FIGM) model. Our result links the SUSY breaking
scale in the gauge mediation framework with the FIMP freeze-in production rate

speed up learning and break undesirable temporal correlations. Despite its
wide-spread application, very little is understood about the properties of

Does it help to prioritize certain experiences? In this paper, we address these
questions by formulating a dynamical systems ODE model of Q-learning with

prioritized replay harms the agent's learning. We show that our analytic

properties of mesoscopic systems. We investigate analytically and numerically
the local density of states in Bernal stacking bilayer graphene with a point
defect. With Bernal stacking structure, there are two types of lattice sites.
One corresponds to connected sites, where carbon atoms from each layer stack on
top of each other, and the other corresponds to disconnected sites. From our
theoretical study, a picture emerges in which the pronounced zero-energy peak
in the local density of states does not attribute to zero-energy impurity
states associated to two different types of defects but to a collective
phenomenon of the low-energy resonant states induced by the defect. To
corroborate this description, we numerically show that at small system size
$N$, where $N$ is the number of unit cells, the zero-energy peak near the
defect scales as $1/\ln N$ for the quasi-localized zero-energy state and as
$1/N$ for the delocalized zero-energy state. As the system size approaches to
the thermodynamic limit, the former zero-energy peak becomes a power-law
singularity $1/|E|$ in low energies, while the latter is broadened into a
Lorentzian shape. A striking point is that both types of zero-energy peaks
decay as $1/r^2$ away from the defect, manifesting the quasi-localized
character. Based on our results, we propose a general formula for the local
density of states in low-energy and in real space. Our study sheds light on

(PKS) chemotaxis model. The classical 2D hyperbolic-elliptic model blows up for
initial mass M>8\pi. We consider more realistic scenario which takes into
account the flow of the ambient environment induced by harmonic potentials, and
thus retain the identical elliptic structure as in the original PKS.
Surprisingly, we find that already the simplest case of linear stationary
vector field, $Ax^\top$, with large enough amplitude $A$, prevents chemotactic
blow-up. Specifically, the presence of such an ambient fluid transport creates
what we call a 'fast splitting scenario', which competes with the focusing
effect of aggregation so that 'enough mass' is pushed away from concentration
along the $x_1$-axis, thus avoiding a finite time blow-up, at least for
M<16\pi. Thus, the enhanced ambient flow doubles the amount of allowable mass
which evolve to global smooth solutions.

observables are needed that allow a good separation between primary photons and
primary hadrons. We present a new observable, $F_\gamma$, which can be
extracted from ground-array data in hybrid events, where simultaneous
measurements of the longitudinal and the lateral shower profile are performed.
The observable is based on a template fit to the lateral distribution measured
by the ground array with the template taking into account the complementary
information from the measurement of the longitudinal profile, i.e. the primary
energy and the geometry of the shower. $F_\gamma$ shows a very good
photon-hadron separation, which is even superior to the separation given by the
well-known $X_\text{max}$ observable (the atmospheric depth of the shower
maximum). At energies around $1\,\text{EeV}$ ($10\,\text{EeV}$), $F_\gamma$
provides a background rejection better than $97.8\,\%$ ($99.9\,\%$) at a signal
efficiency of $50\,\%$. Advantages of the observable $F_\gamma$ are its
technical stability with respect to irregularities in the ground array (i.e.
missing or temporarily non-operating stations) and that it can be applied over
the full energy range accessible to the air shower detector, down to its
threshold energy. Furthermore, $F_\gamma$ complements nicely to $X_\text{max}$
such that both observables can well be combined to achieve an even better
discrimination power, exploiting the rich information available in hybrid
events.

of nuclei, called rosettes. Pathologists are able to identify rosettes [full
circles] and the presence of partial rosettes [semi-circles] and interpret this
as a sign of differentiation in a tumor. However, there is no objective method
to quantitate the many partial rosettes that are obvious or not obvious to the
naked eye. This paper proposes a mathematical algorithm to computationally
detect the presence of obvious or non-obvious partial rosettes, henceforth
referred to as Nguyen-Wu Partial Rosettes. Quantifying the degree of partial
rosettes present in a tumor may allow pathologists to stratify tumors into more
refined groups that may respond better to therapy or have different clinical
outcomes. The Midline Cross Product [MCP] algorithm calculates the magnitude of
two cross products and adds them together to obtain one value. Each of the two
cross products results from [1] the line that connects the midpoints of longest
lengths of two neighboring ovals, and [2] the line that extends from the
midpoint from one longest length and is perpendicular to that longest length.
The MCP algorithm makes nuclei that are arranged in consecutive rows and arches
quantitatively distinct from nuclei that are arranged next to each other in a

organochlorines were detected by gas chromatography-high resolution mass
spectrometry (GC-HRMS). The measured relative abundances (RAmea), simulated
relative abundances (RAsim), and relative variations between RAmea and RAsim
(${\Delta}$RA) were obtained on basis of the detected MS signal intensities of
individual isotopologues. The method has been partially validated in precision,
injection-amount dependency and temporal drifts. The standard deviations (SDs)
of RAmea of all istotopologues of perchlorethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene
(TCE) from different manufacturers were 0.002%-0.069%. The SDs of ${\Delta}$RA
of the first three isotopologues of PCE and TCE from different manufacturers
were 0.026%-0.155%. The ${\Delta}$RA and ${\Delta}$RA patterns of the standards
of PCE and TCE from different manufacturers were able to be differentiated with
statistical significance. The method has been successfully applied to an
analogous case of source identification and apportionment for two
trichlorodiphenyls that exhibited significant chlorine isotope fractionation on
the GC-HRMS system. The results demonstrate that the ${\Delta}$RA in
conjunction with isotope ratios can be applied to source identification and
present high-validity identification outcomes. Moreover, the RAmea can be used
to implement source apportionment for organochlorines from more sources with
more reliable outcomes compared with the methods using isotope ratios only.
This method opens a new way to perform fingerprinting analysis of
compound-specific chlorine isotopologue distribution of organochlorines, and
will be a promising high-performance approach in source delineation and
apportionment for chlorinated organic compounds.

relaxations involving both semi-definite cone and second-order cone constraints
for solving nonconvex polynomial optimization problems to global optimality.
The significance of this hierarchy is that the size and number of the
semi-definite and second-order cone constraints of the relaxations are fixed
and independent of the step or level of the approximation in the hierarchy.
Using the Krivine-Stengle's certificate of positivity in real algebraic
geometry, we establish the convergence of the hierarchy of relaxations,
extending the very recent so-called bounded degree Lasserre hierarchy. In
particular, we also provide a convergent bounded degree second-order cone
programming (SOCP) hierarchy for solving polynomial optimization problems. We
then present finite convergence at step one of the SOCP hierarchy for two
classes of polynomial optimization problems: a subclass of convex polynomial
optimization problems where the objective and constraint functions are
SOCP-convex polynomials, defined in terms of specially structured sum of
squares polynomials, and a class of polynomial optimization problems, involving
polynomials with essentially non-positive coefficients. In the case of one-step
convergence for problems with SOCP-convex polynomials, we show how a global
solution is recovered from the relaxation via Jensen's inequality of
SOCP-convex polynomials. As an application, we derive a corresponding
convergent conic linear programming hierarchy for conic-convex semi-algebraic
programs. Whenever the semi-algebraic set of the conic-convex program is
described by convex polynomial inequalities, we show further that the values of
the relaxation problems converge to the common value of the convex program and
its Lagrangian dual under a constraint qualification.

Pb-Sn-Bi-In-Zn-Tl, and for CR chondrites it is Tl-Zn-Sn-Pb-Bi-In. These
observations suggest that heated CM and CR chondrites underwent volatile loss
under different conditions to one another and to that of the solar nebula, e.g.
differing oxygen fugacities. Furthermore, the most water and volatile depleted
samples are highly enriched in the heavy isotopes of Zn. Taken together, these
lines of evidence strongly indicate that heated CM and CR chondrites incurred
open system heating, stripping them of water and volatiles concomitantly,

significantly reddened (median E(B-V)$\sim$0.5 magnitudes), and have relatively
high electron densities (3.4 $<$ log$_{10}$ n$_e$ (cm$^{-3}$) $<$ 4.8). It is
notable that the latter densities -- obtained using trans-auroral [SII] and
[OII] emission-line ratios -- exceed those typically assumed for the warm,

strongly affect the star formation histories in the inner bulge regions ($r

variety of different contexts such as water waves, liquid Helium, nonlinear
optics, microwave cavities, etc. In this letter, we propose a novel type of
exact (2+1)-dimensional rogue waves which may be found in many physical fields
described by integrable and nonintegrable models. This type of rogue waves are
closely related to invisible lumps. Usually, a lump is an algebraically
localized wave in space but visible at any time. Whence a lump induces a
soliton, the lump will become invisible before or after a fixed time. If a
bounded twin soliton is induced by a lump, the lump will become a rogue wave
(or instanton) and can only be visible at an instant time. Because of the
existence of the induced visible solitons, the rogue wave may be predictable in
some senses. For instance, the height, the position and the arrival time of the
rogue wave can be predictable. The idea is illustrated by the celebrate
(2+1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation in its extended form.

ferroelectricity in terms of universal steric mechanisms. We also predict that
such a novel form of ferroelectricity leads to atypical behaviors, such as an

  Prediction in Networks",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a real-world graph, how can we measure relevance scores for ranking and
link prediction? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides an excellent measure
for this and has been applied to various applications such as friend
recommendation, community detection, anomaly detection, etc. However, RWR
suffers from two problems: 1) using the same restart probability for all the
nodes limits the expressiveness of random walk, and 2) the restart probability
needs to be manually chosen for each application without theoretical
justification. We have two main contributions in this paper. First, we propose
Random Walk with Extended Restart (RWER), a random walk based measure which
improves the expressiveness of random walks by using a distinct restart
probability for each node. The improved expressiveness leads to superior
accuracy for ranking and link prediction. Second, we propose SuRe (Supervised
Restart for RWER), an algorithm for learning the restart probabilities of RWER
from a given graph. SuRe eliminates the need to heuristically and manually
select the restart parameter for RWER. Extensive experiments show that our
proposed method provides the best performance for ranking and link prediction
tasks, improving the MAP (Mean Average Precision) by up to 15.8% on the best

destroyed by scalar and neutrino fields if the initial angular momentum of the

the first example in which a classical field satisfying the null energy
condition can actually destroy an extremal black hole. For scalar fields, the
modes that can lead to the destruction of the horizon are restricted to a
narrow range due to superradiance. Since superradiance does not occur for
neutrino fields, the destruction of the horizon by neutrino fields is generic,
and it cannot be fixed by backreaction effects. We also show that the extremal
black holes that can be destroyed by scalar fields correspond to naked

inversion of subsurface seismic AVO data into lithology/fluid classes and to
assess the associated elastic material properties. Due to the spatial coupling
in the likelihood functions, evaluation of the posterior normalizing constant
is computationally demanding, and brute-force, single-site updating Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithms converges far too slow to be useful. We construct
two classes of approximate posterior models which we assess analytically and

dust mass (10^6---10^9 Msol), and star-formation rates (0.01---100 Msol per

measure the cosmic star-formation history (CSFH), the stellar-mass density
(SMD), and the dust-mass density (DMD) over a 12 Gyr timeline. The data mostly
agree with previous estimates, where they exist, and provide a
quasi-homogeneous dataset using consistent mass and star-formation estimators
with consistent underlying assumptions over the full time range. As a
consequence our formal errors are significantly reduced when compared to the
historic literature. Integrating our cosmic star-formation history we precisely
reproduce the stellar-mass density with an ISM replenishment factor of 0.50 +/-
0.07, consistent with our choice of Chabrier IMF plus some modest amount of
stripped stellar mass. Exploring the cosmic dust density evolution, we find a
gradual increase in dust density with lookback time. We build a simple
phenomenological model from the CSFH to account for the dust mass evolution,
and infer two key conclusions: (1) For every unit of stellar mass which is
formed 0.0065---0.004 units of dust mass is also formed; (2) Over the history
of the Universe approximately 90 to 95 per cent of all dust formed has been

$\log$ N(Li) is higher in more massive/hot stars, c) $\log$ N(Li) is higher in
less evolved stars, i.e. stars of lower \logg, d) stars with the metallicities

  Measurable lithium abundances were found in the atmospheres of 45 stars
located at distances of 20-170 pc from the Sun, for the other 62 stars the
upper limits of log N(Li) were computed. We found well defined dependences of
lithium abundances on \Teff, \vsini, and less pronounced for the \logg. In case
of \vsini we see two sequences of stars: with measurable lithium and with the
upper limit of log N(Li). About 10\% of our targets are known to host planets.
Only two SWP have notable lithium abundances, so we found a lower proportion of
stars with detectable Li among known planet hosts than among stars without
planets. However, given the small sample size of our planet-host sample, our
analysis does not show any statistically significant differences in the lithium
abundance between SWP and stars without known planets.

three-band models, focusing on the empty band and lowest band populated by
spinless fermions. We consider Lieb and kagome lattices and notice phase
transitions driven by the hopping integral between nearest-neighbors, which
leads to the change of the lowest band Chern number from $C=1$ to $C=-1$. In
the single-particle picture, different phases are examined by investigating
corresponding entanglement spectra and the evolution of the entanglement
entropy. Entanglement spectra reveal the spectral flow characteristic of
topologically nontrivial systems before and after phase transitions. For the
lowest band with $1/3$ filling, Fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases are
identified by examining the ground state momenta, the spectral flow, and
counting of the entanglement energy levels below the gap in the entanglement
spectrum. A quasilinear dependence of the entanglement entropy $\alpha(n_A)$
term is observed for FCI phase, similarly to linear behavior expected for
Laughlin phase in the fractional quantum Hall effect. At the topological phase
transition, for both empty and partially filled lowest bands, the energy gap
closure and a discontinuity in the entanglement entropy are observed. This
coincides with the divergence of a standard deviation of the Berry curvature.
We notice also a phase transition driven by the nearest-neighbor interaction in
the Lieb lattice, where the many-body energy gap closes. The phase transitions
are shown to be stable for an arbitrary system size, thus predicted to be
present in the thermodynamic limit. While our calculations are performed for an
interaction energy far exceeding the gap between the two lowest energy bands,
we note that the higher band does not affect the phase transitions, however
destabilizes FCI phases.

the rarity of complete large-scale scholarly data, earlier studies target this
problem based on manual topic extraction from a limited number of domains, with
their focus solely on a single feature such as coauthorship, citation
relations, and etc. Given the compromised effectiveness of such predictions, in
this paper we use a real scholarly dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph, which
provides more than 12000 topics in the field of Computer Science (CS),
including 1200 venues, 14.4 million authors, 30 million papers and their
citation relations over the period of 1950 till now. Aiming to find the topics
that will trend in CS area, we innovatively formalize a hot topic prediction
problem where, with joint consideration of both inter- and intra-topical
influence, 17 different scientific features are extracted for comprehensive
description of topic status. By leveraging all those 17 features, we observe
good accuracy of topic scale forecasting after 5 and 10 years with R2 values of
0.9893 and 0.9646, respectively. Interestingly, our prediction suggests that
the maximum value matters in finding hot topics in scholarly fields, primarily
from three aspects: (1) the maximum value of each factor, such as authors'
maximum h-index and largest citation number, provides three times the amount of
information than the average value in prediction; (2) the mutual influence
between the most correlated topics serve as the most telling factor in
long-term topic trend prediction, interpreting that those currently exhibiting
the maximum growth rates will drive the correlated topics to be hot in the
future; (3) we predict in the next 5 years the top 100 fastest growing (maximum
growth rate) topics that will potentially get the major attention in CS area.

the up quark mass to zero while keeping $m_d$ finite. The $\theta$ angle is
then supposed to become irrelevant, i.e. the topological susceptibility
vanishes. However, the definition of the quark mass is scheme-dependent and
identifying the $m_u=0$ point is not trivial, in particular with Wilson-like
fermions. More specifically, up to our knowledge there is no theoretical
argument guaranteeing that the topological susceptibility exactly vanishes when
the PCAC mass does.
  We will present our recent progresses on the empirical check of this property
using $N_f=1+2$ flavours of clover fermions, where the lightest fermion is
tuned very close to $m^{PCAC}_u$=0 and the mass of the other two is kept of the
order of magnitude of the physical $m_s$. This choice is indeed expected to
amplify any unknown non-perturbative effect caused by $m_u\not=m_d$. The
simulation is repeated for several $\beta$s and those results, although
preliminary, give a hint about what happens in the continuum limit.

further; exploring the impact of the parameters of the model on producing
tangible, non-trivial observations of behaviour that are suggestive of
pedagogical improvement to the course designers and instructors. The
methodology introduced in this paper led to an improved understanding of

spectra measured by running and past experiments above 10$^{19}$ eV are

Array, HiRes I and Yakutsk data rather than with the Auger data in the range

constant and a fluctuating component. The latter will be modeled by a symmetric
L\'evy-stable ($\alpha$-stable) noise. The purpose is to develop a kinetic
approach to eliminate the angular component of the dynamics in order to find a
coarse grained description in the coordinate space. By defining the joint
probability density function of the position and of the orientation of the
particle through the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive transport equations for
the position-dependent marginal density, the particle's mean velocity and the
velocity's variance. At time scales larger than the relaxation time of the
torque $\tau_{\phi}$ the two higher moments follow the marginal density, and
can be adiabatically eliminated. As a result, a closed equation for the
marginal density follows. This equation which gives a coarse-grained
description of the microswimmer's positions at time scales $t\gg \tau_{\phi}$,
is a diffusion equation with a constant diffusion coefficient depending on the
properties of the noise. Hence, the long time dynamics of a microswimmer can be
described as a normal, diffusive, Brownian motion with Gaussian increments.

existence of this phase has been the subject of a long debate. In order to
detect these exotic phases we must use alternative methods to those used for

dynamics (including precipitation, flow shears, etc.) with and without the
formation of polar cap patches around the cusp inflow region by the EISCAT
Svalbard radar (ESR) and two GPS scintillation receivers. A series of polar cap
patches were observed by the ESR between 8:40 and 10:20 UT on December 3, 2011.
The polar cap patches combined with the auroral dynamics were associated with a
significantly higher GPS phase scintillation level (up to 0.6 rad) than those
observed for the other two alternatives, i.e., cusp dynamics without polar cap
patches, and polar cap patches without cusp aurora. The cusp auroral dynamics
without plasma patches were indeed related to GPS phase scintillations at a
moderate level (up to 0.3 rad). The polar cap patches away from the active cusp
were associated with sporadic and moderate GPS phase scintillations (up to 0.2
rad). The main conclusion is that the worst global navigation satellite system
space weather events on the dayside occur when polar cap patches enter the
polar cap and are subject to particle precipitation and flow shears, which is
analogous to the nightside when polar cap patches exit the polar cap and enter
the auroral oval.

results from this set of omega band events agree remarkably well with previous
observations of omega band occurrence in magnetic local time (MLT), lifetime,
location between the region 1 and 2 field-aligned currents, as well as current
density estimates. The average peak emission height of omega forms corresponds
to the estimated precipitation energies of a few keV, which experienced no
significant change during the events. Analysis of both local and global
magnetic indices demonstrates that omega bands are observed during substorm
expansion and recovery phases that are more intense than average substorm
expansion and recovery phases in the same region. The omega occurrence with
respect to the substorm expansion and recovery phases is in a very good
agreement with an earlier observed distribution of fast earthward flows in the
plasma sheet during expansion and recovery phases. These findings support the
theory that omegas are produced by fast earthward flows and auroral streamers,

reformulates the CP decomposition into a set of joint eigenvalue decomposition
(JEVD) problems. Solving all JEVDs, we obtain multiple estimates of the factor
matrices and the best estimate is chosen in a subsequent step by using an
exhaustive search or some heuristic strategy that reduces the computational
complexity. Moreover, the SECSI framework retains the option of choosing the
number of JEVDs to be solved, thus providing an adjustable complexity-accuracy
trade-off. In this work, we provide an analytical performance analysis of the
SECSI framework for the computation of the approximate CP decomposition of a
noise corrupted low-rank tensor, where we derive closed-form expressions of the
relative mean square error for each of the estimated factor matrices. These
expressions are obtained using a first-order perturbation analysis and are
formulated in terms of the second-order moments of the noise, such that apart
from a zero mean, no assumptions on the noise statistics are required.
Simulation results exhibit an excellent match between the obtained closed-form
expressions and the empirical results. Moreover, we propose a new Performance
Analysis based Selection (PAS) scheme to choose the final factor matrix
estimate. The results show that the proposed PAS scheme outperforms the
existing heuristics, especially in the high SNR regime.

excellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However,
regularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the
complex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring
function complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive
regularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in
statistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based
approximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural
networks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the
literature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating
the necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound
for functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic
optimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the
improved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex
function sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image
segmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay,
dropout, and batch normalization. Source code will be released at the time of

the range of applications of the topological recursion has been growing and
many results in different fields have been obtained. The first aspect that I
will develop deals with the historical domain of the topological recursion:
random matrix integrals. I will review the formalism of the topological
recursion as well as how it can be used to obtain asymptotic $\frac{1}{N}$
series expansion of various matrix integrals. In particular, a key feature of
the topological recursion is that it can recover from the leading order of the
asymptotic all sub-leading orders with elementary computations. This method is
particularly well known and fruitful in the case of hermitian matrix integrals,
but I will also show that the general method can be used to cover integrals
with hard edges, integrals over unitary matrices and much more. In the end, I
will also briefly mention the generalization to $\beta$-ensembles. In a second
chapter, I will review the connection between the topological recursion and the
study of integrable systems having a Lax pair representation. Most of the
results presented there will be illustrated by the case of the famous six
Painlev\'e equations. Though the formalism used in this chapter may look
completely disconnected from the previous one, it is well known that the local
statistics of eigenvalues in random matrix theory exhibit a universality
phenomenon and that the encountered universal systems are precisely driven by
some solutions of the Painlev\'{e} equations. As I will show, the connection
can be made very explicit with the topological recursion formalism.

long-term cyclic variations of its pulsation period. A possible explanation
suggested from the shape of the O-C diagram is the light travel-time effect,
which we thoroughly examine. We used original photometric and spectroscopic
measurements and investigated the period evolution using available maximum
times spanning more than one century. If the binary hypothesis is valid, Z CVn
orbits around a black hole with minimal mass of $56.5$ $\mathfrak{M}_{\odot}$
on a very wide ($P_{\rm orbit}=78.3$ years) and eccentric orbit ($e=0.63$). We
discuss the probability of a formation of a black hole-RR Lyrae pair and,
although we found it possible, there is no observational evidence of the black
hole in the direction to Z CVn. However, the main objection against the binary
hypothesis is the comparison of the systemic radial velocity curve model and
spectroscopic observations that clearly show that Z CVn cannot be bound in such
a binary. Therefore, the variations of pulsation period are likely intrinsic to
the star. This finding represents a discovery/confirmation of a new type of
cyclic period changes in RR Lyrae stars. By the analysis of our photometric
data, we found that the Blazhko modulation with period of 22.931 d is strongly
dominant in amplitude. The strength of the phase modulation varies and is
currently almost undetectable. We also estimated photometric physical
parameters of Z CVn and investigated their variations during the Blazhko cycle

significant (e.g., as in a glass that is not in true thermodynamic equilibrium

spherocylinders by means of 3D numerical simulations. As in the case of
spherical particles, the effective friction $\mu$ is an increasing function of
the inertial number $I$, and we systematically investigate the dependence of
$\mu$ on the particle aspect ratio $Q$, as well as that of the normal stress
differences, the volume fraction and the coordination number. We show in
particular that the quasi-static friction coefficient is non-monotonic with
$Q$: from the spherical case $Q=1$, it first sharply increases, reaches a
maximum around $Q \simeq 1.05$, and then gently decreases, reaching back its
initial value for $Q \simeq 2$. We provide a microscopic interpretation for
this unexpected behavior through the analysis of the distribution of
dissipative contacts around the particles: as compared to spheres, slightly
elongated grains enhance contacts in their central cylindrical band, whereas at
larger aspect ratios particles tend to align and dissipate by preferential
contacts at their hemispherical caps.

and the relative angles between successive soft gluon emissions are strongly
increasing. These anti-collinear emissions can violate the correct
time-ordering for time-like cascades and result in large radiative corrections
enhanced by double collinear logs, making the BMS evolution unstable beyond
leading order. We isolate the first such a correction in a recent calculation
of the BMS equation to next-to-leading order by Caron-Huot. To overcome this
difficulty, we construct a collinearly-improved version of the leading-order
BMS equation which resums the double collinear logarithms to all orders. Our
construction is inspired by a recent treatment of the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK)

causal relationship between severity of radiation therapy, summarized by a
multidimensional vector of radiation exposure values and post-treatment side
effects is a problem of clinical interest in radiation oncology. An appropriate
strategy for making interpretable causal conclusions is to reduce the dimension
of treatment. If individual elements of a multidimensional treatment vector
weakly affect the outcome, but the overall relationship between treatment and
outcome is strong, careless approaches to dimension reduction may not preserve
this relationship. Further, methods developed for regression problems do not
directly transfer to causal inference due to confounding complications. In this
paper, we use semiparametric inference theory for structural models to give a
general approach to causal sufficient dimension reduction of a multidimensional

viscous microjet. The jet is produced inside a wettable thin tube partially
submerged in a liquid. The gas-liquid interface inside the tube, which is
initially concave, is kept much deeper than that outside the tube. An impulsive
force applied at the bottom of a liquid container leads to significant
acceleration of the liquid inside the tube followed by flow-focusing due to the
concave interface. The jet generation process can be divided into two parts
that occur in different time scales, i.e. the Impact time (impact duration $\le
O(10^{-4})$ s) and Focusing time (focusing duration $\gg O(10^{-4})$ s). In
Impact time, the liquid accelerates suddenly due to the impact. In Focusing
time, the microjet emerges due to flow-focusing. In order to explain the sudden
acceleration inside the tube in Impact time, we develop a physical model based
on a pressure impulse approach. Numerical simulations confirm the proposed
model, indicating that the basic mechanism of the acceleration of the liquid
due to the impulsive force is elucidated. Remarkably, the viscous effect is
negligible in Impact time. In contrast, in Focusing time, the viscosity plays
an important role in the microjet generation. We experimentally and numerically
investigate the velocity of microjets with various viscosities. We find that
higher viscosities lead to reduction of the jet velocity, which can be
described by using Reynolds number (the ratio between the inertia force and the
viscous force). This novel device may be a starting point for next-generation
technologies, such as high-viscosity inkjet printers including bioprinters and
needle-free injection devices for minimally invasive medical treatments.

the Weyl-invariant extension of TMG which unifies cosmological TMG and
Topologically Massive Electrodynamics (TME) with a Proca mass term. Here, we
have demonstrated that the presence of (Anti)-de Sitter spaces as the
background solution, spontaneously breaks the local Weyl symmetry, whereas the
radiative corrections at two-loop level breaks the symmetry in flat vacuum. The
breaking of Weyl symmetry fixes all the dimensionful parameters and provides
masses to spin-2 and spin-1 particles as in the Higgs mechanism. Secondly, we
calculated the tree-level scattering amplitude in the cosmological TMG plus the
Fierz-Pauli mass term in (Anti)-de Sitter spaces and accordingly found the
relevant weak field potential energies between two covariantly conserved
localized point-like spinning sources. We have shown that in addition to
spin-spin and mass-mass interactions, there also occurs a mass-spin interaction
which is generated by the gravitational Chern-Simons term that changes the
initial spin of particles converting them to gravitational anyons. In addition
to these works concerning TMG, we have also discussed the issue of local
causality in $2+1$ dimensional gravity theories and shown that Einstein's
gravity, TMG and the new massive gravity are causal as long as the sign of the
Newton's constant is set to negative. We study the causality discussion with
the Shapiro time delay method.

difficultly for estimating the model order lies into the noise correlation,

to tackle that problem, one adopts a two-step approach: first, we develop two
different methods based on a Toeplitz-structured model for estimating this

Maronna's $M$-estimators on the whitened signal to estimate the covariance

consistent robust estimators for the covariance matrix of the

multiple stages of low-efficiency, but highly TM-discriminatory QPGs.

performances, and has had a great impact on a range of research fields. Despite
showing the highest system detection efficiency (SDE) ever reported with
SNSPDs, amorphous materials typically lead to lower critical currents, which
impacts on their jitter performance. Combining a very low jitter and a high SDE
remains a challenge. Here, we report on highly efficient superconducting
nanowire single-photon detectors based on amorphous MoSi, combining system
jitters as low as 26 ps and a SDE of 80% at 1550 nm. We also report detailed
observations on the jitter behaviour, which hints at intrinsic limitations and
leads to practical implications for SNSPD performance.

and merger delay timescales. NGC4993 is a nearby (40 Mpc) early-type galaxy,
with $i$-band S\'ersic index $n=4.0$ and low asymmetry ($A=0.04\pm 0.01$).
These properties are unusual for sGRB hosts. However, NGC4993 presents
shell-like structures and dust lanes indicative of a recent galaxy merger, with
the optical transient located close to a shell. We constrain the star formation
history (SFH) of the galaxy assuming that the galaxy merger produced a star
formation burst, but find little to no on-going star formation in either
spatially-resolved broadband SED or spectral fitting. We use the best-fit SFH
to estimate the BNS merger rate in this type of galaxy, as $R_{NSM}^{gal}=
5.7^{+0.57}_{-3.3} \times 10^{-6} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. If star formation is the only
considered BNS formation scenario, the expected number of BNS mergers from
early-type galaxies detectable with LIGO during its first two observing seasons
is $0.038^{+0.004}_{-0.022}$, as opposed to $\sim 0.5$ from all galaxy types.
Hypothesizing that the binary system formed due to dynamical interactions
during the galaxy merger, the subsequent time elapsed can constrain the delay
time of the BNS coalescence. By using velocity dispersion estimates and the
position of the shells, we find that the galaxy merger occurred $t_{\rm
mer}\lesssim 200~{\rm Myr}$ prior to the BNS coalescence.

and $\Delta(1232)$ baryons, to incorporate a possibility of the charged $\rho$
meson condensation in neutron star matter. The influence of the $\rho^-$
condensation on the equation of state proves to be strongly model dependent. In
our models of one type (KVORcut-based ones) the $\rho^-$ condensation arises by
a second-order phase transition above a critical density and the maximum value
of the neutron star mass diminishes only slightly. The matter composition
changes more significantly. In our models of other type (MKVOR*-based ones), if
the system is considered at fixed density, the $\rho^-$ condensation arises by
a second-order phase transition at the baryon density $n=n_{c,\rho}^{(\rm II)}$
and at a slightly higher density $n=n_{c,\rho}^{(\rm I)}$ there occurs a
first-order phase transition. In a neutron star matter starting with a density
$n<n_{c,\rho}^{(\rm II)}$ there appears a region of a mixed phase, or the
system is described by Maxwell construction, that results in a substantial
decrease of the value of the maximum neutron star mass. Nevertheless in the
models under consideration the observational constraint on the maximum neutron
star mass is fulfilled. Besides, in MKVOR*-based models the appearance of the
$\rho^-$ condensate is accompanied by a strong rearrangement of the matter
composition. Dependence of the results on a choice of the $\rho$ meson scaling
functions for the effective $\rho$ meson mass and coupling constants is also
investigated.

also compare it to the Wasserstein diffusion on P\_2(R) constructed by von

protect user data against eavesdroppers that can gain access to network links

as block security) that requires that the eavesdroppers would not be able to
decode individual files or combinations of a small number of files. The
standard approach for achieving block security is to use a joint design scheme
that consists of (inner) storage code and the (outer) coset code. However,
jointly designing the codes requires that the user, who pre-processes and
stores the files, should know the underlying storage code in order to design
the (outer) linear transformation for achieving weak security. In many
practical scenarios, such as storing the files on the third party cloud storage
system, it may not be possible for the user to know the underlying storage
code.

design from the storage code design for minimum storage regenerating codes

DR25 Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs, Twicken et al. 2016). The Robovetter also
vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs
caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discusses
the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less
than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits
that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is
greater than 85%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the
fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is
greater than 98%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and
500 days around FGK dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7% complete and the
catalog is 50.5% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits and all of the
simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA

Koopman operator-based reduced order models (K-ROMs). The Koopman operator is a
linear but infinite-dimensional operator which describes the dynamics of
observables. A numerical approximation of the Koopman operator therefore yields
a linear system for the observation of an autonomous dynamical system. In our
approach, by introducing a finite number of constant controls, the dynamic
control system is transformed into a set of autonomous systems and the
corresponding optimal control problem into a switching time optimization
problem. This allows us to replace each of these systems by a K-ROM which can
be solved orders of magnitude faster. By this approach, a nonlinear
infinite-dimensional control problem is transformed into a low-dimensional
linear problem. In situations where the Koopman operator can be computed
exactly using Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), the proposed approach
yields optimal control inputs. Furthermore, a recent convergence result for
EDMD suggests that the approach can be applied to more complex dynamics as
well. To illustrate the results, we consider the 1D Burgers equation and the 2D
Navier--Stokes equations. The numerical experiments show remarkable performance
concerning both solution times and accuracy.

separation asymptotes to zero in the massive case but grows, at late times,

effectively to zero for masses larger than half the expansion rate. We find out
also that the tree-order variance of field variation decreases when quantum

perceives in the field strength as fluctuations happen does not deviate from
the average effect as much as the tree-order variance implies.

or more orders of magnitude in coming years, making it interesting to consider
the ""spin-dependent"" (SD) contribution to the rate. This process does not
benefit from the atomic-number-squared enhancement of the spin-independent (SI)
contribution, but probes different operators. We give details of our recent
estimate of the spin dependent rate, expressed as a function of operator
coefficients at the experimental scale, and explore the prospects for
distinguishing coefficients by using different targets. For this purpose, a
geometric representation of different targets as vectors in coefficient space
is introduced. It is found that comparing the rate on isotopes with and without
spin could allow to detect spin dependent coefficients that are at least a
factor of few larger than the spin independent ones. Distinguishing among the
axial, tensor and pseudoscalar operators that induce the SD rate would require
calculating the nuclear matrix elements for the second two. Comparing the SD
rate on nuclei with an odd proton vs odd neutron could allow to distinguish
operators involving $u$ quarks from those involving $d$ quarks; this is
interesting because the distinction is difficult to make for SI operators.

low-energy-scale inflation model with a $\dot{\phi}$-dependent $m_g$. We
compute the energy density spectrum $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k)$ today of the GW

up to the detectable ranges of both CMB and DECIGO, but the bound from the big
bang nucleosynthesis is quite tight to limit the growth. In low-scale inflation
with a fast transition to the reheating stage driven by the potential
$V(\phi)=M^2 \phi^2/2$ around $\phi \approx M_{\rm pl}$ (where $M_{\rm pl}$ is
the reduced Planck mass), we find that the peak position of $\Omega_{\rm

process that previously had been interpreted as the propagation of transient
propagating coronal disturbances (PCD)s. Our observations are supported by 2.5D

energy conversion efficiency. Increasing the number of the chromophores
increases the number of dark states and the associated enhanced energy
conversion efficiency, yet also delocalizes excitations away from the trapping
center and reduces the energy conversion rate. Therefore, a competition between
dark state protection and delocalization must be considered when designing the
optimal size of a light harvesting system. In this study, we explore the two
competing mechanisms in a chain-structured antenna and show that dark state
protection is the dominant mechanism, with an intriguing dependence on the
parity of the number of chromophores. This dependence is linked to the exciton

advent of high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy from the Interface Region

presence of very high apparent motions of order 100-300 km/s in spicules, as
measured in the plane of the sky. However, line-of-sight measurements of such
high speeds have been difficult to obtain, with values deduced from Doppler
shifts in spectral lines typically of order 30-70 km/s. In this work we resolve
this long-standing discrepancy using recent 2.5D radiative MHD simulations.
This simulation has revealed a novel driving mechanism for spicules in which
ambipolar diffusion resulting from ion-neutral interactions plays a key role.
In our simulation we often see that the upward propagation of magnetic waves
and electrical currents from the low chromosphere into already existing
spicules can lead to rapid heating when the currents are rapidly dissipated by
ambipolar diffusion. The combination of rapid heating and the propagation of
these currents at Alfv\'enic speeds in excess of 100 km/s leads to the very
rapid apparent motions, and often wholesale appearance, of spicules at
chromospheric and transition region temperatures. In our simulation, the
observed fast apparent motions in such jets are actually a signature of a
heating front, and much higher than the mass flows, which are of order 30-70
km/s. Our results can explain the behavior of transition region ""network jets""

quantum theory is a simple confusion between the notions of formalism versus

that there are actually two inequivalent quantum formalisms, namely the
relative-state formalism and the standard formalism with the Born and
measurement-update rules. We further propose a different probability rule for
the relative-state formalism and discuss how Wigner's-friend-type experiments

different particles, each being characterized by the complete set of the Dirac

beyond the standard QED, makes it necessary to choose another solution of the
Dirac equation for the free particle propagator as compared to that used
currently. The Bethe-Salpeter equation with these particle propagators is
studied in the ladder approximation. A new branch of the massless composite
bosons formed by the coupled electron-positron pairs with the coupling equal to
the fine structure constant, has been found. It has been obtained that: 1) the
massless bosons have the normalized complex wave functions, which are
transversely compressed plane waves; 2) the transverse radius of the wave
functions diverges as the boson energy goes to zero that is, the composite
bosons cannot be at rest; 3) the extension of the transverse wave function in
the momentum space and the compression of the coordinate wave function are
continuously occurred with increasing the boson energy. The reaction
$e^{-}e^{+}\to B\gamma\gamma$ products of which are the massless composite
boson and two photons, is investigated. The cross-section of this reaction is
derived for the non-relativistic colliding beams of the spin-polarized
electrons and positrons. In this case the $2\gamma$ angular correlation
spectrum is characterized by a narrow peak with the full-width-at-half-maximum
not exceeding 0.2 mrad. It is shown that to establish whether there is the
conventional annihilation of singlet electron-positron pair with the two-photon
emission or the investigated reaction, products of which are the three

of the effective quantum vacuum in which the determinant of the tetrad field
changes sign through a crossing to a vacuum state with a degenerate fermionic
metric. Such a transition is realized in polar distorted superfluid $^3$He-A in
terms of the effective tetrad fields emerging in the vicinity of the superfluid
gap nodes: the tetrads of the Weyl points in the chiral A-phase of $^3$He and
the degenerate tetrad in the vicinity of a Dirac nodal line in the polar phase
of $^3$He. The continuous phase transition from the $A$-phase to the polar
phase, i.e. in the transition from the Weyl nodes to the Dirac nodal line and
back, allows one to follow the behavior of the fermionic and bosonic effective
actions when the sign of the tetrad determinant changes, and the effective
chiral space-time transforms to anti-chiral ""anti-spacetime"". This condensed
matter realization demonstrates that while the original fermionic action is
analytic across the transition, the effective action for the orbital degrees of
freedom (pseudo-EM) fields and gravity have non-analytic behavior. In
particular, the action for the pseudo-EM field in the vacuum with Weyl fermions
(A-phase) contains the modulus of the tetrad determinant. In the vacuum with
the degenerate metric (polar phase) the nodal line is effectively a family of
$2+1$d Dirac fermion patches, which leads to a non-analytic $(B^2-E^2)^{3/4}$
QED action in the vicinity of the Dirac line.

framework that combines the computational merit of memristor crossbars with the
advantages of an operator splitting method, alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Here, ADMM helps in splitting a complex optimization
problem into subproblems that involve the solution of systems of linear
equations. The capability of this framework is shown by applying it to linear
programming, quadratic programming, and sparse optimization. In addition to
ADMM, implementation of a customized power iteration (PI) method for
eigenvalue/eigenvector computation using memristor crossbars is discussed. The
memristor-based PI method can further be applied to principal component

studied at different spatial and temporal scales. For example, rainfall data
measured daily by rain gauges can be considered at daily, monthly or annual
temporal scales, and local, grid-wise, region-wise or country-wise spatial
scales. In this work, we focus on detection of anomalies in such multi-scale
spatio-temporal data. We consider an anomaly as an event where the measured
values over a spatio-temporally extended region are significantly different
from their long-term means. However we aim to avoid setting any thresholds on
the measured values and spatio-temporal sizes, because not only are thresholds
subjective but also the long-term mean values often vary spatially and
temporally. For this purpose we use spatio-Temporal Markov Random Field, where
latent states indicate anomaly type (positive anomaly, negative anomaly, no
anomaly/normal). Spatio-temporal coherence is maintained through suitable edge
potentials. The model is extended to multiple spatio-temporal scales to achieve
our second goal: anomalies at any scale should be defined both on the data at
that scale, and also on anomalies at other scales. This allows us to trace an
anomaly at a coarse scale to finer scales. For example, whether rainfall in a
particular year is anomalous over a region should depend not only on the total
volume of rainfall over the entire region, but also on whether there were such
anomalies at the grid-scale, and the monthly scale. We use this approach to
study rainfall anomalies over India -extremely diverse with respect to
rainfall- for the period 1901-2011, and show its benefits over existing
approaches.

fundamentally described from basic concepts. A derived tuning-free model,
supported with experiments, reveals the underlying spectral content of the
power fluctuations of a wind farm. It contains two power-law trends and
oscillations in the relatively low- and high-frequency ranges. The former is
mostly due to the turbulent interaction between the flow and the turbine
properties; whereas the latter is due to the advection between turbine pairs.
The spectral wind-farm scale power fluctuations $\Phi_P$ exhibits a power-law
decay proportional to $f^{-5/3-2}$ in the region corresponding to the
turbulence inertial subrange and at relatively large scales, $\Phi_P\sim
f^{-2}$. Due to the advection and turbulent diffusion of large-scale
