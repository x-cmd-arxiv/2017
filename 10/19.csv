states that allow exquisite color sensing capabilities due to their anomalous
suppression of density fluctuations for distinct subsets of particles, as
recently evidenced in photoreceptor mosaics in avian retina. Motivated by this
biological finding, we present the first statistical-mechanical model that
rigorously achieves disordered multihyperuniform many-body systems by tuning
interactions in binary mixtures of non-additive hard-disk plasmas. We
demonstrate that multihyperuniformity competes with phase separation and
stabilizes a clustered phase. Our work provides a systematic means to generate
disordered multihyperuniform solids, enabling one to explore their potentially
novel photonic, phononic, electronic and transport properties.

broadening of spectral lines beyond what is expected from thermal and
instrumental broadening. The remaining non-thermal broadening is significant
(5-30 km/s) and correlated with the intensity. Here we study spectra of the TR
Si IV 1403 Angstrom line obtained at high resolution with the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). We find that the large improvement in spatial
resolution (0.33 arcsec) of IRIS compared to previous spectrographs (2 arcsec)
does not resolve the non-thermal line broadening which in most regions remains
at pre-IRIS levels of about 20 km/s. This invariance to spatial resolution
indicates that the processes behind the broadening occur along the
line-of-sight (LOS) and/or on spatial scales (perpendicular to the LOS) smaller
than 250 km. Both effects appear to play a role. Comparison with IRIS
chromospheric observations shows that, in regions where the LOS is more
parallel to the field, magneto-acoustic shocks driven from below impact the TR
and can lead to significant non-thermal line broadening. This scenario is
supported by MHD simulations. While these do not show enough non-thermal line
broadening, they do reproduce the long-known puzzling correlation between
non-thermal line broadening and intensity. This correlation is caused by the
shocks, but only if non-equilibrium ionization is taken into account. In
regions where the LOS is more perpendicular to the field, the prevalence of
small-scale twist is likely to play a significant role in explaining the
invariance and correlation with intensity.

matter halo reaching its first orbital apocenter and turning around in its
orbit. The cluster-centric radius at which this process occurs, r_sp, defines a
halo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster. A rapid decline
in the halo profile is expected near r_sp. We measure the galaxy number density
and weak lensing mass profiles around redMaPPer galaxy clusters in the first
year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean M_200m mass
~2.5 x 10^14 M_sun, we find strong evidence of a splashback-like steepening of
the galaxy density profile and measure r_sp=1.13 +/- 0.07 Mpc/h, consistent
with earlier SDSS measurements of More et al. (2016) and Baxter et al. (2017).
Moreover, our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the
existence of a splashback-like steepening of the matter profile of galaxy
clusters. We measure r_sp=1.34 +/- 0.21 Mpc/h from the weak lensing data, in
good agreement with our galaxy density measurements. For different cluster and
galaxy samples, we find that consistent with LCDM simulations, r_sp scales with
R_200m and does not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3--0.6.
We also find that potential systematic effects associated with the redMaPPer
algorithm may impact the location of r_sp. We discuss progress needed to
understand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from
DES and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock
catalogs and independent cluster samples.

evaluate whether MRI could be used to track immune cell populations in response

cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were labelled with
superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles.
  Methods: SPIO-labelled cells were injected into mice (one cell type/mouse)
implanted with an HPV-based cervical cancer model. Half of these mice were also
vaccinated with DepoVaxTM, a lipid-based vaccine platform that was developed to
enhance the potency of peptide-based vaccines.
  Results: MRI visualization of CTLs, Tregs and MDSCs was apparent 24 hours
post-injection, with hypointensities due to iron labelled cells clearing
approximately 72 hours post-injection. Vaccination resulted in increased
recruitment of CTLs and decreased recruitment of MDSCs and Tregs to the tumour.
We also found that MDSC and Treg recruitment was positively correlated with
final tumour volume.
  Conclusion: This type of analysis can be used to non-invasively study changes
in immune cell recruitment in individual mice over time, potentially allowing
improved application and combination of immunotherapies.

and dependence beyond Gaussianity, but statistical inference is often hampered
by a lack of closed-form marginal distributions, and simulation-based inference
may be prohibitively computer-intensive. We here remedy such issues through a
class of process convolutions based on smoothing a (d+1)-dimensional L\'evy
basis with an indicator function kernel to construct a d-dimensional
convolution process. Indicator kernels ensure univariate distributions in the
L\'evy basis family, which provides a sound basis for interpretation,
parametric modeling and statistical estimation. We propose a class of isotropic
stationary convolution processes constructed through hypograph indicator sets
defined as the space between the curve (s,H(s)) of a spherical probability
density function H and the plane (s,0). If H is radially decreasing, the
covariance is expressed through the univariate distribution function of H. The
bivariate joint tail behavior in such convolution processes is studied in
detail. Simulation and modeling extensions beyond isotropic stationary spatial
models are discussed, including latent process models. For statistical
inference of parametric models, we develop pairwise likelihood techniques and
illustrate these on spatially indexed weed counts in the Bjertop data set, and
on daily wind speed maxima observed over 30 stations in the Netherlands.

where a continuum domain is modelled through particles connected via physical

materials were modelled in the PD framework as different isotropic materials
(for instance, fibre and matrix of a composite laminate), where the stiffness
of the bond depends on its orientation. A non-ordinary state-based formulation
will enable the modelling of generally anisotropic materials, where the
material properties are directly embedded in the formulation. Other material
models include rocks, concrete and biomaterials such as bones. In this paper,
we implemented this model and validated it for anisotropic composite materials.
A composite damage criterion has been employed to model the crack propagation

  Improved solvers, which keep the staggered Yee-type grid for electric and

Maxwell-Faraday equation by increasing the computational stencil. These
modified solvers can be characterized by different sets of coefficients,
leading to different dispersion properties. In this work we introduce a norm

solve this problem numerically and show that the minimization procedure leads
to phase and group velocities that are considerably closer to $c$ as compared

Depending on a specific problem at hand (e.g. electron beam propagation in
plasma, high-order harmonic generation from plasma surfaces, etc), the norm
function can be chosen accordingly, for example, to minimize the numerical
dispersion in a certain given propagation direction. Particle-in-cell

structure so that the organization of complex systems can be detected and
quantified. Computational mechanics developed from efforts in the 1970s and
early 1980s to identify strange attractors as the mechanism driving weak fluid
turbulence via the method of reconstructing attractor geometry from measurement
time series and in the mid-1980s to estimate equations of motion directly from
complex time series. In providing a mathematical and operational definition of
structure it addressed weaknesses of these early approaches to discovering
patterns in natural systems.
  Since then, computational mechanics has led to a range of results from
theoretical physics and nonlinear mathematics to diverse applications---from
closed-form analysis of Markov and non-Markov stochastic processes that are
ergodic or nonergodic and their measures of information and intrinsic
computation to complex materials and deterministic chaos and intelligence in
Maxwellian demons to quantum compression of classical processes and the
evolution of computation and language.
  This brief review clarifies several misunderstandings and addresses concerns
recently raised regarding early works in the field (1980s). We show that
misguided evaluations of the contributions of computational mechanics are
groundless and stem from a lack of familiarity with its basic goals and from a
failure to consider its historical context. For all practical purposes, its
modern methods and results largely supersede the early works. This not only
renders recent criticism moot and shows the solid ground on which computational
mechanics stands but, most importantly, shows the significant progress achieved
over three decades and points to the many intriguing and outstanding challenges
in understanding the computational nature of complex dynamic systems.

precursors. We investigate a broad range of characteristic ratios from the
fully flexible case to those typical of bulky synthetic polymers. Increasing
stiffness hinders bonding of groups separated by short contour distances and
increases looping over longer distances, leading to more compact nanoparticles
with a structure of highly interconnected loops. This feature is reflected in a
crossover in the scaling behaviour of several structural observables. The
scaling exponents change from those characteristic for Gaussian chains or rings
in $\theta$-solvents in the fully flexible limit, to values resembling fractal
or `crumpled' globular behaviour for very stiff SCNPs. We characterize domains
in the SCNPs. These are weakly deformable regions that can be seen as
disordered analogues of domains in disordered proteins. Increasing stiffness
leads to bigger and less deformable domains. Surprisingly, the scaling
behaviour of the domains is in all cases similar to that of Gaussian chains or
rings, irrespective of the stiffness and degree of cross-linking. It is the
spatial arrangement of the domains which determines the global structure of the
SCNP (sparse Gaussian-like object or crumpled globule). Since intramolecular
stiffness can be varied through the specific chemistry of the precursor or by
introducing bulky side groups in its backbone, our results propose a new
strategy to tune the global structure of SCNPs.

Braverman and Kazhdan, using an algebro-geometric approach, different from

NS radius from above and the maximum mass M_max of NSs from above. These
constraints are particularly robust because they only require a measurement of
the chirp mass and a distinction between prompt and delayed collapse of the

from the presence/absence of a ringdown gravitational-wave (GW) signal. This
prospect strengthens the case of our novel method of constraining NS

established within less than an e-fold of expansion after the end of inflation.
In this case self-resonance is efficient and the condensate fragments into
transient, localised spherical objects which are unstable and decay, leaving
behind them a virialized field with mean kinetic and gradient energies much
greater than the potential energy. This end-state yields $w=1/3$. When $M\ll

$w\rightarrow 1/3$ after inflation, which can be used as an upper bound (under
certain assumptions) on the duration of the transition between the inflationary

uncertainties in CMB observables such as the spectral tilt $n_{\rm{s}}$, and
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. For quadratic minima ($n=1$), $w\rightarrow0$

ultraviolet spectrum of a lensed galaxy at z~2.9 with prominent interstellar
absorption lines from O I, tracing neutral gas, up to O VI, tracing
transitional phase gas. The O VI profile mimics weak low-ionization profiles at
low velocities, and strong saturated profiles at high velocities. These trends
indicate that O VI gas is co-spatial with the low-ionization gas. Further, at
velocities blueward of -200 km/s the column density of the low-ionization
outflow rapidly drops while the O VI column density rises, suggesting that O VI
is created as the low-ionization gas is destroyed. Photoionization models do
not reproduce the observed O VI, but adequately match the low-ionization gas,
indicating that the phases have different formation mechanisms. Photoionized
outflows are more massive than O VI outflows for most of the observed
velocities, although the O VI mass outflow rate exceeds the photoionized
outflow at velocities above the galaxy's escape velocity. Therefore, most gas
capable of escaping the galaxy is in a hot outflow phase. We suggest that the O

asteroseismic data for 415 dwarfs and subgiants. Asteroseismic data have been
obtained by Kepler in short cadence. The spectroscopic parameters are based on
spectra taken as part of APOGEE and correspond to DR13 of SDSS. We analyze our
data using two Teff scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those
derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results
arising from these choices as a test of systematic Teff, and find that they can
lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties.
Determinations of surface gravity ($\log{g}$), mean density ($\rho$), radius
($R$), mass ($M$), and age ($\tau$) for the whole sample have been carried out
with stellar grid-based modeling. We have assessed random and systematic error
sources in the spectroscopic and seismic data, as well as in the grid-based
modeling determination of the stellar quantities in the catalog. We provide
stellar properties for both Teff scales. The median combined (random and
systematic) uncertainties are 2% (0.01 dex; $\log{g}$), 3.4% ($\rho$), 2.6%
($R$), 5.1% ($M$), and 19% ($\tau$) for the photometric Teff scale and 2%

determining stellar parameters accurately. We compare our results with those
from other sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and
asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good
agreement in all cases. Comparisons give strong support to the determination of
stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future

results include a theory for 2d valence-bond solids subject to weak bond
randomness, as well as extensions to stronger disorder regimes where we make
connections with quantum spin liquids. We find, on various lattices, that the
destruction of a valence-bond solid phase by weak quenched disorder leads
inevitably to the nucleation of topological defects carrying spin-1/2 moments.
This renormalizes the lattice into a strongly random spin network with
interesting low-energy excitations. Similarly when short-ranged valence bonds
would be pinned by stronger disorder, we find that this putative glass is
unstable to defects that carry spin-1/2 magnetic moments, and whose residual
interactions decide the ultimate low energy fate. Motivated by these results we
conjecture Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-like restrictions on ground states for
disordered magnets with spin-1/2 per statistical unit cell. These conjectures
are supported by an argument for 1d spin chains. We apply insights from this
study to the phenomenology of YbMgGaO$_4$, a recently discovered triangular
lattice spin-1/2 insulator which was proposed to be a quantum spin liquid. We
instead explore a description based on the present theory. Experimental
signatures, including unusual specific heat, thermal conductivity, and

the differences in the rate of growth of structure, we find that dark energy,
at its observed value, has negligible impact on star formation in the Universe.
We study these effects beyond the present day by allowing the simulations to
run forward into the future ($t>13.8$ Gyr). We show that the impact of
$\Lambda$ becomes significant only when the Universe has already produced most
of its stellar mass, only decreasing the total co-moving density of stars ever
formed by ${\approx}15\%$. We develop a simple analytic model for the cosmic
star formation rate that captures the suppression due to a cosmological
constant. The main reason for the similarity between the models is that
feedback from accreting black holes dramatically reduces the cosmic star
formation at late times. Interestingly, simulations without feedback from
accreting black holes predict an upturn in the cosmic star formation rate for
$t>15$ Gyr due to the rejuvenation of massive ($ > 10^{11} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)
galaxies. We briefly discuss the implication of the weak dependence of the
cosmic star formation on $\Lambda$ in the context of the anthropic principle.

at fixed mass into different percentiles of each assembly variable, we present
the joint dependence of halo bias on the {\it values} of halo mass and each
assembly variable. In the plane of halo mass and one assembly variable, the
joint dependence can be largely described as halo bias increasing outward from
a global minimum. We find it unlikely to have a combination of halo variables
to absorb all assembly bias effects. We then present the joint dependence of
halo bias on two assembly variables at fixed halo mass. The gradient of halo
bias does not necessarily follow the correlation direction of the two assembly
variables and it varies with halo mass. Therefore in general for two correlated
assembly variables one cannot be used as a proxy for the other in predicting
halo assembly bias trend. Finally, halo assembly is found to affect the
kinematics of haloes. Low-mass haloes formed earlier can have much higher
pairwise velocity dispersion than those of massive haloes. In general, halo
assembly leads to a correlation between halo bias and halo pairwise velocity
distribution, with more strongly clustered haloes having higher pairwise
velocity and velocity dispersion. However, the correlation is not tight, and
the kinematics of haloes at fixed halo bias still depends on halo mass and

DR13 data - and explore their origin by comparing two N-body models of isolated
galaxies which develop a bar and a boxy/peanut (b/p) bulge. Both models have
been proposed as scenarios for reconciling a disc origin of the MW bulge with a
negative vertical metallicity gradient. The first model is a superposition of
co-spatial, i.e. overlapping, disc populations with different scaleheights,
kinematics and metallicities. In this model the thick, metal-poor, and
centrally concentrated disc populations contribute significantly to the stellar
mass budget in the inner galaxy. The second model is a single disc with an
initial steep radial metallicity gradient, which is mapped by the bar into the
b/p bulge in such a way that the vertical metallicity gradient of the MW bulge
is reproduced -- as shown already in previous works in the literature. However,
as we show here, the latter model does not reproduce the positive longitudinal
metallicity gradient of the inner disc, nor the metal-poor innermost regions of
the Bulge seen in the data. On the other hand, the model with co-spatial thin
and thick disc populations reproduces all the aforementioned trends. We
therefore see that it is possible to reconcile a (primarily) disc origin for
the MW bulge with the observed trends in metallicity by mapping the inner thin
and thick discs of the MW into a b/p. For this scenario to reproduce the
observations, the $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor, thick disc populations must
have a significant mass contribution in the inner regions -- as has been
suggested for the Milky Way.

biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers' individual qualities
could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher
rates while speakers on the right acted, often successfully, to preserve prior

resoundingly successfully using the Stokes parameters, and numerous proposals
offer new quantum counterparts of this characterization. The latter often rely
on distance measures from completely polarized or unpolarized light. We here
show that the accepted class of perfectly polarized quantum states of light is
severely lacking in terms of both pure states and mixed states. By appealing to
symmetry and geometry arguments we determine all of the states corresponding to
perfect polarization, and show that the accepted class of completely polarized
quantum states is only a subset of our result. We use this result to
reinterpret the canonical degree of polarization, commenting on its
interpretation for classical and quantum light. Our results are necessary for
any further characterizations of light's polarization.

successfully explained the available experimental data, yielding a complex
picture of the way nuclei interact with electroweak probes. This achievement is
of great interest from the pure nuclear-physics point of view. But it is of
much broader interest too, because the level of accuracy and confidence reached
by these calculations opens up the concrete possibility of using nuclei to
address open questions in other sub-fields of physics, such as, understanding
the fundamental properties of neutrinos, or the particle nature of dark matter.
  In this talk, I will review recent progress in microscopic calculations of
electroweak properties of light nuclei, including electromagnetic moments, form
factors and transitions in between low-lying nuclear states along with
preliminary studies for single- and double-beta decay rates. I will illustrate
the key dynamical features required to explain the available experimental data,

$z$=2.5. 50\% of star formation is obscured for galaxies with

at lower masses, there exists a tail of low mass extremely obscured
star-forming galaxies at $z>1$. For log(M/M$_{\odot}$)$>$10.5, $>$90\% of star

$f_{\mathrm{obscured}}$ is lower at higher redshift. At fixed mass,
high-redshift galaxies are observed to have more compact sizes and much higher
star formation rates, gas fractions and hence surface densities (implying
higher dust obscuration), yet we observe no redshift evolution in

describe how this particular DSSG team responded to those dilemmas, and how
those responses gave rise to still more dilemmas. While the details of the case
discussed here are unique, the ethical dilemmas they illuminate can commonly be
found across many DSSG projects. These include: the risk of exacerbating
disparities; the thorniness of algorithmic accountability; the evolving
opportunities for mischief presented by new technologies; the subjective and
value- laden interpretations at the heart of any data-intensive project; the
potential for data to amplify or mute particular voices; the possibility of
privacy violations; and the folly of technological solutionism. Based on our
tracing of the team's responses to these dilemmas, we distill lessons for an
ethical data science practice that can be more generally applied across DSSG
projects. Specifically, this case experience highlights the importance of: 1)
Setting the scene early on for ethical thinking 2) Recognizing ethical
decision-making as an emergent phenomenon intertwined with the quotidian work

strong, often unassessable, assumptions. The most common of these is that the
mechanism that created the missing data is ignorable - a twofold assumption
dependent on the mode of inference. The first part, which is the focus here,
under the Bayesian and direct-likelihood paradigms, requires that the missing
data are missing at random; in contrast, the frequentist-likelihood paradigm
demands that the missing data mechanism always produces missing at random data,
a condition known as missing always at random. Under certain regularity
conditions, assuming missing always at random leads to an assumption that can
be tested using the observed data alone namely, the missing data indicators
only depend on fully observed variables. Here, we propose three different
diagnostic tests that not only indicate when this assumption is incorrect but
also suggest which variables are the most likely culprits. Although missing
always at random is not a necessary condition to ensure validity under the
Bayesian and direct-likelihood paradigms, it is sufficient, and evidence for
its violation should encourage the careful statistician to conduct targeted
sensitivity analyses.

also yield weakly ionizing tracks. If a heavy neutrino has an electric dipole
moment (EDM), then the milliQan experiment may be sensitive to it as well. In
particular, writing the general dimension-5 operator for an EDM with a scale of
a TeV and a one-loop factor, one finds a potential EDM as high as a few times
$10^{-17}$ e-cm, and models exist where it is an order of magnitude higher.
Redoing the Bethe calculation of ionization energy loss for an EDM, it is found
that the milliQan detector is sensitive to EDMs as small as $10^{-17}$ e-cm.
Using the production cross-section and analyzing the acceptance of the milliQan

Thomassen proved that every planar graph of girth at least five is 3-choosable.
As for other surfaces, Thomassen proved that there are only finitely many
4-critical graphs of girth at least five embeddable in any fixed surface. This
implies a linear-time algorithm for deciding 3-colorablity for graphs of girth
at least five on any fixed surface. Dvorak, Kral and Thomas strengthened
Thomassen's result by proving that the number of vertices in a 4-critical graph
of girth at least five is linear in its genus. They used this result to prove
Havel's conjecture that a planar graph whose triangles are pairwise far enough
apart is 3-colorable. As for list-coloring, Dvorak proved that a planar graph
whose cycles of size at most four are pairwise far enough part is 3-choosable.
  In this article, we generalize these results. First we prove a linear
isoperimetric bound for 3-list-coloring graphs of girth at least five. Many new
results then follow from the theory of hyperbolic families of graphs developed
by Postle and Thomas. In particular, it follows that there are only finitely
many 4-list-critical graphs of girth at least five on any fixed surface, and
that in fact the number of vertices of a 4-list-critical graph is linear in its
genus. This provides independent proofs of the above results while generalizing
Dvorak's result to graphs on surfaces that have large edge-width and yields a
similar result showing that a graph of girth at least five with crossings
pairwise far apart is 3-choosable. Finally, we generalize to surfaces
Thomassen's result that every planar graph of girth at least five has
exponentially many distinct 3-list-colorings. Specifically, we show that every
graph of girth at least five that has a 3-list-coloring has
$2^{\Omega(n)-O(g)}$ distinct 3-list-colorings.

We focus on the hyperfine structure of the metastable ammonia inversion lines
(J,K) = (1,1) - (6,6) to derive column density, kinematics, opacity and kinetic
gas temperature. In the CMZ molecular clouds, we find typical line widths of
$8-16$ km s$^{-1}$ and extended regions of optically thick ($\tau > 1$)
emission. Two components in kinetic temperature are detected at $25-50$ K and
$60-100$ K, both being significantly hotter than dust temperatures throughout
the CMZ. We discuss the physical state of the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in
the context of the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. (2015) that interprets the
observed distribution as a stream of molecular clouds following an open
eccentric orbit. This allows us to statistically investigate the time
dependencies of gas temperature, column density and line width. We find heating
rates between $\sim 50$ and $\sim 100$ K Myr$^{-1}$ along the stream orbit. No
strong signs of time dependence are found for column density or line width.
These quantities are likely dominated by cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results
qualitatively match the predictions of the current model of tidal triggering of
cloud collapse, orbital kinematics and the observation of an evolutionary
sequence of increasing star formation activity with orbital phase.

points, one asymptotic de Sitter attractor at infinity and a $2$-dim invariant
plane. We identified four distinct parameter domains $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ for
which the pair of critical points engenders distinct features in the dynamics.
In the domain $A$ the dynamics consists basically of periodic bouncing orbits,
or oscillatory orbits with a finite number of bounces. The center with
multiplicity two engenders in its neighborhood the topology of stable and
unstable cylinders $R \times S^3$ of orbits. We show that the stable and
unstable cylinders coalesce realizing a smooth homoclinic connection to the
center manifold, a rare event of regular/non-chaotic dynamics in bouncing
Bianchi IX cosmologies. The presence of a saddle of multiplicity two in the
domain $B$ engenders a high instability in the dynamics so that the cylinders
emerging from the center manifold towards the bounce have four distinct
attractors: the center manifold itself, the de Sitter attractor at infinity and
two further momentum-dominated attractors with infinite anisotropy. In the
domain $C$ we examine the features of invariant manifolds of orbits about a
saddle of multiplicity two. The presence of the saddle of multiplicity two

extension work creating a trusted user network. We develop and demonstrate a
method for accurate calculation of the multivariate normal likelihood equation,
for a set of parameters given the partitioned data, which can then be maximized
to obtain estimates. These estimates are achieved without sharing any data or
any true intermediate statistics of the data across firewalls. We show that
under a certain set of assumptions our method for estimation across these
partitions achieves identical results as estimation with the full data. Privacy
is maintained by adding noise at each partition. This ensures each party
receives noisy statistics, such that the noise cannot be removed until the last
step to obtain a single value, the true total log-likelihood. Potential
applications include all methods utilizing parameter estimation through
maximizing the multivariate normal likelihood equation. We give detailed

different contributions to the spectral density conspire to give a chiral
condensate at fixed $\theta$ that does not change sign when the quark mass (or
one of the quark masses for two flavors) crosses the imaginary axis, while the
chiral condensate at fixed topological charge does change sign. From QCD at
nonzero density we have learnt that the discontinuity of the chiral condensate
may move to a different location when the spectral density increases
exponentially with the volume with oscillations on the order of the inverse
volume. This is indeed what happens when the product of the quark masses
becomes negative, but the situation is more subtle in this case: the
contribution of the ""quenched"" part of the spectral density diverges in the
thermodynamic limit at nonzero $\theta$, but this divergence is canceled
exactly by the contribution from the zero modes. We conclude that the zero
modes are essential for the continuity of the chiral condensate and that their
contribution has to be perfectly balanced against the contribution from the
nonzero modes. Lattice simulations at nonzero $\theta$-angle can only be

determine whether the detector performs to specifications. The clear fibres
coming from the bars were shown to transmit the desired amount of light, and
only four dead channels were identified in the electronics. Two channels had
indubitably been mismatched during assembly and the DAQ channel map was
subsequently corrected. The level of crosstalk is within acceptable values for
the type of multi-anode photomultiplier used with an average of
$0.20\pm0.03\,\%$ probability of occurrence in adjacent channels and a mean
amplitude equivalent to $4.5\pm0.1\,\%$ of the primary signal intensity. The
efficiency of the signal acquisition, defined as the probability of recording a

$99.73\pm0.02\,\%$.

scattered starlight from high-contrast imaging measurements, both in numerical

using ground-based telescopes we investigate the response of EFC to unaccounted
for deviations from an ideal optical model. We explore the linear nature of the
algorithm by assessing its response to a range of inaccuracies in the optical
model generally present in real systems. We find that the algorithm is
particularly sensitive to unresponsive deformable mirror (DM) actuators,
misalignment of the Lyot stop, and misalignment of the focal plane mask.
Vibrations and DM registration appear to be less of a concern compared to
values expected at the telescope. We quantify how accurately one must model
these core coronagraph components to ensure successful EFC corrections. We
conclude that while the condition of the DM can limit contrast, EFC may still
be used to improve the sensitivity of high-contrast imaging observations. Our
results have informed the development of a full EFC implementation using the
Project 1640 coronagraph at Palomar observatory. While focused on a specific
instrument our results are applicable to the many coronagraphs that may be

Therefore, it is important to elucidate the general principles governing their
thermodynamics/folding mechanisms. Here, we combine experiments and simulations
to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the VPK pseudoknot, a variant of
the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) PK involved in ribosomal frameshifting.
Fluorescent nucleotide analogs (2-aminopurine and pyrrolocytidine) placed at
different stem/loop positions in the PK, and laser temperature-jump approaches
serve as local probes allowing us to monitor the order of assembly of VPK with
two helices with different intrinsic stabilities. The experiments and molecular
simulations show that at 50 mM KCl the dominant folding pathway populates only
the more stable partially folded hairpin. As the salt concentration is
increased a parallel folding pathway emerges, involving the less stable hairpin
structure as an alternate intermediate. Notably, the flux between the pathways
is modulated by the ionic strength. The findings support the principle that the
order of PK structure formation is determined by the relative stabilities of
the hairpins, which can be altered by sequence variations or salt
concentrations. Our study not only unambiguously demonstrates that PK folds by
parallel pathways, but also establishes that quantitative description of RNA
self-assembly requires a synergistic combination of experiments and

photons and generate tunable high-order harmonic pulses. This phenomenon, known
as photon acceleration, has traditionally required extreme-intensity laser
pulses and macroscopic propagation lengths. Here, we report on a novel
nonlinear material$-$an ultrathin semiconductor metasurface$-$that exhibits
efficient photon acceleration at low intensities. We observe a signature
nonlinear manifestation of photon acceleration: third-harmonic generation of
near-infrared photons with tunable frequencies reaching up to
$\approx3.1\omega$. A simple time-dependent coupled-mode theory, found to be in
good agreement with experimental results, is utilized to predict a new path
towards nonlinear radiation sources that combine resonant upconversion with
broadband operation.

low-reflectivity window with unique attributes, with distinct characteristics
different from typical dielectric moth-eye-like structures. To be specific,
while the latter systems are entirely symmetric, the reflection response of our

response emanates from the cascaded coupling of vortex-like cavity modes at
each of the SiC blocks comprising the micropyramids and translates into a
strongly uni-directional absorber response. We discuss how, by virtue of
Kirchhoff's law, this strongly uni-directional superabsorber behavior implies a
strongly uni-directional emission profile that is important for one-way
infrared sources and passive radiative-cooling systems.

covariates $X$ and $Z$ is an affine function of $X$ such that the slope $\beta$
and the intercept $\alpha$ are real valued measurable functions on the range of
the completely arbitrary random element $Z$. Assume that $X$ has a finite
moment of order greater than or equal to $2$, $Y$ has a finite moment of
conjugate order, and $\alpha\left(Z\right)$ and $\alpha\left(Z\right)X$ have
finite first moments. Then, the nonparametric regression function equals the
least squares linear regression function of $Y$ on $X$ with all the moments
that appear in the expression of the linear regression function calculated
conditional on $Z$. Consequently, conditional mean independence implies zero
conditional covariance and a degenerate version of the aforesaid affine form
for the nonparametric regression function, whereas the aforesaid affine form
and zero conditional covariance imply conditional mean independence. Further,
it turns out that the nonparametric regression function has the aforesaid
affine form if $X$ is Bernoulli, and since $1$ is the conjugate exponent of
$\infty$, the least squares linear regression formula for the nonparametric
regression function holds when $Y$ has only a finite first moment and $Z$ is

inward-moving filaments were identified using monitoring data taken by Chandra
in 2000-2014. These inward-moving shock locations are nearly coincident with
hard X-ray (15-40 keV) hot spots seen by NuSTAR. From proper motion
measurements, the transverse velocities were estimated to be in the range
$\sim$2,100-3,800 km s$^{-1}$ for a distance of 3.4 kpc. The shock velocities
in the frame of the expanding ejecta reach values of $\sim$5,100-8,700 km
s$^{-1}$, slightly higher than the typical speed of the forward shock.
Additionally, we find flux variations (both increasing and decreasing) on
timescales of a few years in some of the inward-moving shock filaments. The
rapid variability timescales are consistent with an amplified magnetic field of
$B \sim$ 0.5-1 mG. The high speed and low photon cut-off energy of the
inward-moving shocks are shown to imply a particle diffusion coefficient that
departs from the Bohm regime ($k_0 = D_0/D_{\rm 0,Bohm} \sim$ 3-8) for the few
simple physical configurations we consider in this study. The maximum electron
energy at these shocks is estimated to be $\sim$8-11 TeV, smaller than the
values of $\sim$15-34 TeV inferred for the forward shock. Cassiopeia A is
dynamically too young for its reverse shock to appear to be moving inward in

features are usually designed to capture the relevance signals. Most of these
features are computed based on the extracted textual elements, link analysis,
and user logs. However, Web pages are not solely linked texts, but have
structured layout organizing a large variety of elements in different styles.
Such layout itself can convey useful visual information, indicating the
relevance of a Web page. For example, the query-independent layout (i.e., raw
page layout) can help identify the page quality, while the query-dependent
layout (i.e., page rendered with matched query words) can further tell rich
structural information (e.g., size, position and proximity) of the matching
signals. However, such visual information of layout has been seldom utilized in
Web search in the past. In this work, we propose to learn rich visual features
automatically from the layout of Web pages (i.e., Web page snapshots) for
relevance ranking. Both query-independent and query-dependent snapshots are
considered as the new inputs. We then propose a novel visual perception model
inspired by human's visual search behaviors on page viewing to extract the
visual features. This model can be learned end-to-end together with traditional
human-crafted features. We also show that such visual features can be
efficiently acquired in the online setting with an extended inverted indexing
scheme. Experiments on benchmark collections demonstrate that learning visual
features from Web page snapshots can significantly improve the performance of
relevance ranking in ad-hoc Web retrieval tasks.

that humans can address empirically: ""How did the Universe make its first
stars?"". Our First Lights At REionization (FLARE) project transforms the quest
for the epoch of reionization from the static to the time domain. It targets
the complementary question: ""What happened to those first stars?"". It will be
answered by observations of the most luminous events: supernovae and accretion
on to black holes formed by direct collapse from the primordial gas clouds.
These transients provide direct constraints on star-formation rates (SFRs) and
the truly initial Initial Mass Function (IMF), and they may identify possible
stellar seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Furthermore, our knowledge
of the physics of these events at ultra-low metallicity will be much expanded.
JWST's unique capabilities will detect these most luminous and earliest cosmic
messengers easily in fairly shallow observations. However, these events are
very rare at the dawn of cosmic structure formation and so require large area
coverage. Time domain astronomy can be advanced to an unprecedented depth by
means of a shallow field of JWST reaching 27 mag AB in 2 and 4.4 microns over a
field as large as 0.1 square degree visited multiple times each year. Such a
survey may set strong constraints or detect massive Pop III SNe at redshifts
beyond 10, pinpointing the redshift of the first stars, or at least their
death. Based on our current knowledge of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), such
a survey will find one or more SLSNe at redshifts above 6 in five years and
possibly several direct collapse black holes. Although JWST is not designed as
a wide field survey telescope, we show that such a wide field survey is

Minimax results under the spectral norm have previously been established for
covariance matrices, both sparse and banded, and for sparse precision matrices.
We establish minimax estimation bounds for estimating banded precision matrices

in our analysis is that we are able to obtain barely-noisy estimates of $k
\times k$ subblocks of the precision matrix by inverting slightly wider blocks
of the empirical covariance matrix along the diagonal. Our theoretical results
are complemented by experiments demonstrating the sharpness of our bounds.

reach. Here, we report a number of plasma and thermal annealing methods for the
fabrication of emitters in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)

annealing in Ar is highly robust, and yields a seven-fold increase in the
concentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma etching step generates
emitters that suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step process
yields emitters that are photostable at room temperature and have an emission
energy distribution that is red-shifted relative to that of pristine hBN. An
analysis of emitters fabricated by a range of plasma and annealing treatments,
combined with a theoretical investigation of point defects in hBN indicates
that single photon emitters characterized by a high degree of photostability

complexes that contain oxygen. This is further confirmed by generating the
emitters by annealing hBN in an oxidative atmosphere. Our findings advance
present understanding of the structure of quantum emitter in hBN and enhance

structure imprinted on exciton wavefunctions by the moir\'e, which underlies
the SOC when hopping couples nanodots into superlattices. We show that the

candles, and their use in cosmology led to the first confirmation of the as yet
unexplained accelerated cosmic expansion. Many of the theoretical models to
explain the cosmic acceleration assume modifications to Einsteinian General
Relativity which accelerate the expansion, but the question of whether such
modifications also affect the ability of SNIe to be standardisable candles has
rarely been addressed. This paper is an attempt to answer this question. For
this we adopt a semi-analytical model to calculate SNIe light curves in
non-standard gravity. We use this model to show that the average rescaled
intrinsic peak luminosity -- a quantity that is assumed to be constant with
redshift in standard analyses of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) cosmology data --
depends on the strength of gravity in the supernova's local environment because
the latter determines the Chandrasekhar mass -- the mass of the SNIa's white
dwarf progenitor right before the explosion. This means that SNIe are no longer
standardisable candles in scenarios where the strength of gravity evolves over
time, and therefore the cosmology implied by the existing SNIa data will be
different when analysed in the context of such models. As an example, we show
that the observational SNIa cosmology data can be fitted with both a model
where $(\Omega_{\rm M}, \Omega_{\Lambda})=(0.62, 0.38)$ and Newton's constant
$G$ varies as $G(z)=G_0(1+z)^{-1/4}$ and the standard model where $(\Omega_{\rm

  correlation and sparsity of material images",,,"10.1002/mp.13001",,"physics.med-ph math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dual energy CT (DECT) enhances tissue characterization because it can produce
images of basis materials such as soft-tissue and bone. DECT is of great
interest in applications to medical imaging, security inspection and
nondestructive testing. Theoretically, two materials with different linear
attenuation coefficients can be accurately reconstructed using DECT technique.
However, the ability to reconstruct three or more basis materials is clinically
and industrially important. Under the assumption that there are at most three
materials in each pixel, there are a few methods that estimate multiple
material images from DECT measurements by enforcing sum-to-one and a box
constraint ([0 1]) derived from both the volume and mass conservation
assumption. The recently proposed image-domain multi-material decomposition
(MMD) method introduces edge-preserving regularization for each material image
which neglects the relations among material images, and enforced the assumption
that there are at most three materials in each pixel using a time-consuming
loop over all possible material-triplet in each iteration of optimizing its
cost function. We propose a new image-domain MMD method for DECT that considers
the prior information that different material images have common edges and
encourages sparsity of material composition in each pixel using regularization.

folding optimization that is applied to a three-dimensional AB off-lattice

used to improve convergence speed and to reduce the runtime complexity of the
energy calculation. For this purpose, a local movement is introduced within the
local search. The designed evolutionary algorithm has fast convergence speed
and, therefore, when it is trapped into the local optimum or a relatively good
solution is located, it is hard to locate a better similar solution. The
similar solution is different from the good solution in only a few components.
A component reinitialization method is designed to mitigate this problem. Both
the new mechanisms and the proposed algorithm were analyzed on well-known amino
acid sequences that are used frequently in the literature. Experimental results
show that the employed new mechanisms improve the efficiency of our algorithm
and that the proposed algorithm is superior to other state-of-the-art
algorithms. It obtained a hit ratio of 100% for sequences up to 18 monomers,
within a budget of $10^{11}$ solution evaluations. New best-known solutions
were obtained for most of the sequences. The existence of the symmetric

behaviour of colloidal suspensions of hard board-like particles (HBPs). While
theories restricting particle orientation or ignoring higher ordered phases
suggest the existence of a stable biaxial nematic phase, our recent simulation
results on monodisperse systems indicate that this is not necessarily the case,
even for particle shapes exactly in between prolate and oblate geometries,
usually referred to as self-dual shape. Motivated by the potentially striking
impact of incorporating biaxial ordering into display applications, we extend
our investigation to bidisperse mixtures of short and long HBPs and analyse
whether size dispersity can further enrich the phase behaviour of HBPs,
eventually destabilise positionally ordered phases and thus favour the
formation of the biaxial nematic phase. Not only do our results indicate that
bidisperse mixtures of self-dual shaped HBPs cannot self-assemble into biaxial
nematic phases, but they also show that these particles are not able to form
uniaxial nematic phases either. This surprising behaviour is also observed in
monodisperse systems. Additionally, bidisperse HBPs tend to phase separate in
coexisting isotropic and smectic phases or, at relatively large pressures, in a
smectic phase of mostly short HBPs and a smectic phase of mostly long HBPs. We
conclude that limiting the particle orientational degrees of freedom or
neglecting the presence of positionally ordered (smectic, columnar and crystal)
phases can dramatically alter the phase behaviour of HBPs and unrealistically
enlarge the region of stability of the biaxial nematic phase.

period Voyager 1 measured the Lyman $\alpha$ emission in the outer heliosphere
at an almost fixed direction close to the upwind (that is towards the
interstellar flow). The data show an unexpected behavior in 2003-2009: the
ratio of observed intensity to the solar Lyman $\alpha$ flux is almost
constant. Numerical modelling of these data is performed in the frame of a
state-of-art self-consistent kinetic-MHD model of the heliospheric interface
(Izmodenov & Alexashov, 2015). The model results, for various interstellar
parameters, predict a monotonic decrease of intensity not seen in the data. We
propose two possible scenarios that explain the data qualitatively. The first
is the formation of a dense layer of hydrogen atoms near the heliopause. Such a
layer would provide an additional backscattered Doppler shifted Lyman $\alpha$
emission, which is not absorbed inside the heliosphere and may be observed by
Voyager. About 35 R of intensity from the layer is needed. The second scenario
is an external non-heliospheric Lyman $\alpha$ component, which could be
galactic or extragalactic. Our parametric study shows that $\sim$25 R of
additional emission leads to a good qualitative agreement between the Voyager 1
data and the model results.

prize value and the weight of each incident edge. The algorithm is
spontaneously initiated at a special node called the \emph{root node} and when

accretion luminosity typically changes by 10% on short time-scales (over 20
days), by ~30% over a year, but can change by 100% or more for individual AGN.
The EUV gap is the most uncertain part of the intrinsic SED, introducing a ~25%
uncertainty in the accretion-induced luminosity, relative to the model
independent interpolation method that we adopt. That aside, our analysis shows
that the uncertainty in the accretion-induced luminosity, the Eddington
luminosity ratio and the bolometric correction factors can be reduced (by a
factor of two or more) by use of SEDs built from data obtained within 20 days.
However, mass accretion rate and mass accretion efficiency are mostly limited
by the unknown EUV emission and the unknown details of the central engine and
our aspect angle.

systems. As a feedback of user's taste, rating scores can directly reflect the
preference of a given user to a given product. Uncovering the latent components
of user ratings is thus of significant importance for learning user interests.
In this paper, a new recommendation approach, called LCR, was proposed by
investigating the latent components of user ratings. The basic idea is to
decompose an existing rating into several components via a cost-sensitive
learning strategy. Specifically, each rating is assigned to several latent
factor models and each model is updated according to its predictive errors.
Afterwards, these accumulated predictive errors of models are utilized to
decompose a rating into several components, each of which is treated as an
independent part to retrain the latent factor models. Finally, all latent
factor models are combined linearly to estimate predictive ratings for users.
In contrast to existing methods, LCR provides an intuitive preference modeling
strategy via multiple component analysis at an individual perspective.
Meanwhile, it is verified by the experimental results on several benchmark

rising in a stagnant liquid using Euler-Lagrangian (EL) approach. The
continuous liquid phase is modeled using BGK approximation of lattice Boltzmann
method (LBM), and a Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) approach has been used
to model the dispersed gas (bubble) phase. A two-way coupling scheme is
implemented for the interface interaction between two phases. The simulation
results are compared with the theoretical and experimental data reported in the
literature and it was found that the presented modeling technique is in good
agreement with the theoretical and experimental data for the relative and
terminal velocity of a bubble. We also performed the grid independence test for
the current model and the results show that the grid size does not affect the
rationality of the results. The stability test has been done by finding the
relative velocity of a bubble as a function of time for the different value of
dimensionless relaxation frequency. The present study is relevant for
understanding the bubble-fluid interaction module and helps to develop the
accurate numerical model for bioreactor simulation.

extensive applications, such as spectral clustering, community detection,
complex network, image processing and so on. The associated graph Laplacian
matrix is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and is usually large and sparse.
Computing some smallest positive eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is
often of interest.
  However, the singularity of $L$ makes the classical eigensolvers inefficient
since we need to factorize $L$ for the purpose of solving large and sparse
linear systems exactly. The next difficulty is that it is usually time
consuming or even unavailable to factorize a large and sparse matrix arising
from real network problems from big data such as social media transactional
databases, and sensor systems because there is in general not only local
connections.
  In this paper, we propose an eignsolver based on the inexact residual Arnoldi
method together with an implicit remedy of the singularity and an effective
deflation for convergent eigenvalues. Numerical experiments reveal that the
integrated eigensolver outperforms the classical Arnoldi/Lanczos method for
computing some smallest positive eigeninformation provided the LU factorization

relaxation time approximation for the case of one-dimensional boost-invariant
geometry. Quarks are massive and described by the Fermi-Dirac statistics, while
gluons are massless and obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The conservation laws
for the baryon number, energy, and momentum lead to two Landau matching
conditions which specify the coupling between the quark and gluon sectors and
determine the proper-time dependence of the effective temperature and baryon
chemical potential of the system. The numerical results illustrate how a
non-equlibrium mixture of quarks and gluons approaches hydrodynamic regime
described by the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate forms of the kinetic
coefficients. The shear viscosity of a mixture is the sum of the shear
viscosities of quark and gluon components, while the bulk viscosity is given by
the formula known for a gas of quarks, however, with the thermodynamic
variables characterising the mixture. Thus, we find that massless gluons
contribute in a non-trivial way to the bulk viscosity of a mixture, provided
quarks are massive. We further observe the hydrodynamization effect which takes
place earlier in the shear sector than in the bulk one. The numerical studies
of the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse pressures show, to a good
approximation, that it depends on the ratio of the relaxation and proper times
only. This behaviour is connected with the existence of an attractor solution
for conformal systems.

related to the intermittent development of large-scale coherent structures. The
existence of these structures is rooted into the nonlinear dynamical equations
obeyed by each system, therefore it is expected that some prior knowledge or
guessing of these equations is needed if one wishes to infer the corresponding
PDF; conversely, the empirical knowledge of the PDF does provide information
about the underlying dynamics. In this work we suggest that it is not always
necessary. We show how, under some assumptions, a formal evolution equation for
the PDF $p(x)$ can be written down, corresponding to the progressive
accumulation of measurements of the generic observable $x$. The limiting
solution to this equation is computed analytically, and shown to interpolate
between some of the most common distributions, Gamma, Beta and Gaussian PDF's.
The control parameter is just the ratio between the rms of the fluctuations and
the range of allowed values. Thus, no information about the dynamics is
required.

This paper presents a framework for such navigation based on the model of
generalized velocity obstacles (GVO). The idea of velocity obstacles has been
well studied and developed for obstacle avoidance since being proposed in 1998.
Though it has been proved to be successful, most studies have assumed equations
of motion to be linear, which limits their application to holonomic robots. In
addition, more attention has been paid to the immediate reaction of robots,
while advance planning has been neglected. By applying the GVO model to
differential drive robots and by combining it with RRT*, we reduce the
uncertainty of the robot trajectory, thus further reducing the range of
concern, and save both computation time and running time. By introducing
uncertainty for the dynamic obstacles with a Kalman filter, we dilute the risk
of considering the obstacles as uniformly moving along a straight line and
guarantee the safety. Special concern is given to path generation, including
curvature check, making the generated path feasible for nonholonomic robots. We
experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the framework.

redshift z > 0.5, which are expected to be detected in the PAH features or dust
continuum by a wide (10 deg^2) or deep (1 deg^2) blind survey, both for a given
observation time of 600 hours. As by-products of the wide blind survey, we also
expect to detect debris disks, through the mid-IR excess above the photospheric

demonstrate that the SPICA mid-IR surveys will efficiently provide us with
unprecedentedly large spectral samples, which can be studied further in the

generalized to the perturbation by a thin disc (which is more relevant
astrophysically), but, due to a rather bad convergence properties, the
resulting expansions are not suitable for specific (numerical) computations.
However, we show that Green's functions represented by the Will's result can be

In particular, they can be integrated out over the source (thin disc in our

for the dragging angular velocity. The procedure is demonstrated, in the first
perturbation order, on the simplest case of a constant-density disc, including
physical interpretation of the results in terms of a one-component perfect

large datasets. However, many important learning problems demand an ability to
draw valid inferences from small size datasets, and such problems pose a
particular challenge for deep learning. In this regard, various researches on
""meta-learning"" are being actively conducted. Recent work has suggested a
Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) for meta-learning. MANN is an
implementation of a Neural Turing Machine (NTM) with the ability to rapidly
assimilate new data in its memory, and use this data to make accurate
predictions. In models such as MANN, the input data samples and their
appropriate labels from previous step are bound together in the same memory
locations. This often leads to memory interference when performing a task as
these models have to retrieve a feature of an input from a certain memory
location and read only the label information bound to that location. In this
paper, we tried to address this issue by presenting a more robust MANN. We
revisited the idea of meta-learning and proposed a new memory augmented neural
network by explicitly splitting the external memory into feature and label
memories. The feature memory is used to store the features of input data
samples and the label memory stores their labels. Hence, when predicting the
label of a given input, our model uses its feature memory unit as a reference
to extract the stored feature of the input, and based on that feature, it
retrieves the label information of the input from the label memory unit. In
order for the network to function in this framework, a new memory-writingmodule
to encode label information into the label memory in accordance with the
meta-learning task structure is designed. Here, we demonstrate that our model
outperforms MANN by a large margin in supervised one-shot classification tasks

contains a conjugacy class $C$ such that for each non-identity element $x \in

result, we introduce a new invariant $\gamma_u(G)$, which we call the uniform
domination number of $G$. This is the minimal size of a subset $S$ of conjugate

is to determine close to best possible bounds on $\gamma_u(G)$ for each family
of simple groups. For example, we will prove that there are infinitely many
non-abelian simple groups $G$ with $\gamma_u(G) = 2$. To do this, we develop a
probabilistic approach, based on fixed point ratio estimates. We also establish
a connection to the theory of bases for permutation groups, which allows us to
apply recent results on base sizes for primitive actions of simple groups.

  Aims. Our aim is to observe the poloidal and toroidal fields relevant to the
global solar dynamo and see if their evolution is captured by a
Babcock-Leighton dynamo.
  Methods. We use synoptic maps of the surface radial field from the KPNSO/VT
and SOLIS observatories to construct the poloidal field as a function of time
and latitude, and Wilcox Solar Observatory and SOHO/MDI full disk images to
infer the longitudinally averaged surface azimuthal field. We show that the
latter is consistent with an estimate of that due to flux emergence and
therefore closely related to the subsurface toroidal field.
  Results. We present maps of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field of the
global solar dynamo. The longitude-averaged azimuthal field observed at the
surface results from flux emergence. At high latitudes this component follows
the radial component of the polar fields with a short time lag (1-3 years). The
lag increases at lower latitudes. The observed evolution of the poloidal and
toroidal magnetic fields is described by the (updated) Babcock-Leighton dynamo
model.

and the target are modeled as points. In the beginning, the agent is at
distance at most $D>0$ from the target. Reaching the target means that the
agent gets at a {\em sensing distance} at most $r>0$ from it. The agent has a
measure of length and a compass. We consider two scenarios: in the {\em static}
scenario the target is inert, and in the {\em dynamic} scenario it may move
arbitrarily at any (possibly varying) speed bounded by $v$. The agent has no
information about the parameters of the problem, in particular it does not know
$D$, $r$ or $v$. The goal is to reach the target at lowest possible cost,
measured by the total length of the trajectory of the agent.
  Our main result is establishing the minimum cost (up to multiplicative
constants) of reaching the target under both scenarios, and providing the
optimal algorithm for the agent. For the static scenario the minimum cost is
$\Theta((\log D + \log \frac{1}{r}) D^2/r)$, and for the dynamic scenario it is
$\Theta((\log M + \log \frac{1}{r}) M^2/r)$, where $M=\max(D,v)$. Under the
latter scenario, the speed of the agent in our algorithm grows exponentially
with time, and we prove that for an agent whose speed grows only polynomially

entanglement in higher dimensions is experimentally challenging because the
number of measurements required scales unfavourably with dimension. While
bounds can be used to certify high-dimensional entanglement, they do not
quantify the degree to which quantum states are entangled. Here, we propose a
quantitative measure that is both an entanglement measure and a dimension
witness, which we coin the P-concurrence. We derive this measure by requiring
entanglement to extend to qubit subspaces that constitute the high-dimensional
state. The computation of the P-concurrence is not contingent on reconstructing
the full density matrix, and requires less measurements compared to standard
quantum state tomography by orders of magnitude. This allows for faster and
more efficient characterization of high-dimensional quantum states.

given a branch decomposition of mim-width $w$, we give an

provides a unified algorithm for many well-known classes, such as Interval
graphs and Permutation graphs, and furthermore, it gives the first
polynomial-time algorithms for other classes of bounded mim-width, such as
Circular Permutation and Circular $k$-Trapezoid graphs for fixed $k$. In all
these classes the decomposition is computable in polynomial time, as shown by
Belmonte and Vatshelle [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2013]. We show that powers of
graphs of tree-width $w - 1$ or path-width $w$ and powers of graphs of
clique-width $w$ have mim-width at most $w$. These results extensively provide
new classes of bounded mim-width. We prove a slight strengthening of the first

a mim-width decomposition of its $k$-power in polynomial time, and apply our
algorithm to solve Feedback Vertex Set on the $k$-power in time

Hamiltonian Cycle is NP-complete even on graphs of linear mim-width $1$, which
further hints at the expressive power of the mim-width parameter.

partial differential equations. The differential operators used in these
equations may have properties such as symmetry, skew-symmetry, positive or
negative (definite)-ness. Symmetry-preserving methods are such that the
discretized form of the continuous differential operator exhibits the same
properties as the continuous operator itself. The use of symmetry-preserving
discretizations makes it possible to construct discrete models which allow all
the manipulations needed to prove stability and (discrete) conservation
properties in the same way they were proven in the original continuous model.
Furthermore, these methods allow a discretization of the continuous adjoint
which is at the same time the discrete adjoint of the discrete forward model.
Such adjoint models are not harder to code than the discrete forward model.
  This paper presents a new symmetry-preserving discretization of arbitrary
order on curvilinear structured grids. The key idea is to use mutually-adjoint
sampling and interpolation operators to switch between the continuous and
discrete operator. The novelty of this work is that it combines three important
requirements for discretizations: first, the symmetry-preserving discretization
is made for arbitrary order of accuracy; second, the method works for every
structured curvilinear mesh; and third, the method can be applied to every
continuous operator. This paper is the first in a series of papers that
gradually extends the theory to a general approach.

or other modes. The SNiPER task component is in charge of event loop, which is
like a simplified application manager. Two types of tasks are introduced in the
simulation framework, one is global task and another is worker task. The global
task will run only once to initialize detector geometry and physics processes.
The worker tasks will be spawned after global task is done. In each worker
task, a Geant4 run manager is invoked to do the real simulation. Therefore the
simulation framework and the underlying TBB have been decoupled. Finally, the
software performance of parallelized JUNO simulation software is also

can be expected during its life time. Consequently, designers must define loads
based on extreme environmental conditions to verify structural integrity. The
environmental contour method is an approach to systematically derive these
extreme environmental design conditions. The method needs a probability density
function as its input. Here we propose the use of constant bandwidth kernel
density estimation to derive the joint probability density function of
significant wave height and wind speed. We compare kernel density estimation
with the currently recommended conditional modeling approach. In comparison,
kernel density estimation seems better suited to describe the statistics of
environmental conditions of simultaneously high significant wave height and
wind speed. Consequently, an environmental contour based on kernel density
estimation does include these environmental conditions while an environmental
contour based on the conditional modeling approach does not. Since these
environmental conditions often lead to the highest structural responses, it is
especially important that the used method outputs these conditions as design
requirements.

specific optical mode with the evanescent field of a tapered fibre. The studied
microspheres show monomode and multi-mode lasing action, which can be modulated
in the best case up to 10 MHz. We have optically transduced thermally-activated
mechanical eigenmodes appearing in the 50-70 MHz range, the frequency of which
decreases with increasing the size of the microspheres. In a pump-and-probe
configuration we observed modulation of the probe signal up to the maximum pump
modulation frequency of our experimental setup, i.e., 20 MHz. This modulation
decreases with frequency and is unrelated to lasing emission, pump scattering
or thermal effects. We associate this effect to free-carrier-dispersion induced
by multiphoton pump light absorption. On the other hand, we conclude that, in
our current experimental conditions, it was not possible to resonantly excite
the mechanical modes. Finally, we discuss on how to overcome these limitations

the frequency of the mechanical eigenmodes displaying a strong degree of
optomechanical coupling.

  2017",,,,"cs.PL cs.DC cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed protocols such as Paxos play an important role in many computer
systems. Therefore, a bug in a distributed protocol may have tremendous
effects. Accordingly, a lot of effort has been invested in verifying such
protocols. However, checking invariants of such protocols is undecidable and
hard in practice, as it requires reasoning about an unbounded number of nodes
and messages. Moreover, protocol actions and invariants involve both quantifier
alternations and higher-order concepts such as set cardinalities and
arithmetic.
  This paper makes a step towards automatic verification of such protocols. We
aim at a technique that can verify correct protocols and identify bugs in
incorrect protocols. To this end, we develop a methodology for deductive
verification based on effectively propositional logic (EPR)---a decidable
fragment of first-order logic (also known as the Bernays-Sch\""onfinkel-Ramsey
class). In addition to decidability, EPR also enjoys the finite model property,
allowing to display violations as finite structures which are intuitive for
users. Our methodology involves modeling protocols using general
(uninterpreted) first-order logic, and then systematically transforming the
model to obtain a model and an inductive invariant that are decidable to check.
The steps of the transformations are also mechanically checked, ensuring the
soundness of the method. We have used our methodology to verify the safety of
Paxos, and several of its variants, including Multi-Paxos, Vertical Paxos, Fast
Paxos, Flexible Paxos and Stoppable Paxos. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first to verify these protocols using a decidable logic, and the
first formal verification of Vertical Paxos, Fast Paxos and Stoppable Paxos.

synchronization dynamics in terms of a global performance metric, compute it
under very simplified assumptions, and use it to gain insight on the role of
system parameters, in particular, inertia. In this paper, we wish to extend
this approach to more realistic scenarios, by incorporating the heterogeneity
of machine ratings, more complete machine models, and also to more closely map
it to classical power engineering notions such as Nadir, Rate of Change of
Frequency (RoCoF), and inter-area oscillations.
  We consider the system response to a step change in power excitation, and
define the system frequency as a weighted average of generator frequencies
(with weights proportional to each machine's rating); we characterize Nadir and
RoCoF by the $L_\infty$ norm of the system frequency and its derivative,
respectively, and inter-areas oscillations by the $L_2$ norm of the error of
the vector of bus frequencies w.r.t. the system frequency.
  For machine models where the dynamic parameters (inertia, damping, etc.) are
proportional to rating, we analytically compute these norms and use them to
show that the role of inertia is more nuanced than in the conventional wisdom.
With the classical swing dynamics, inertia constant plays a secondary role in
performance. It is only when the turbine dynamics are introduced that the
benefits of inertia become more prominent.

and diseases) have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
However, there are still two major challenges towards deepening our
understanding of the genetic architectures of complex phenotypes. First, the
majority of GWAS hits are in the non-coding region and their biological
interpretation is still unclear. Second, accumulating evidence from GWAS
suggests the polygenicity of complex traits, i.e., a complex trait is often
affected by many variants with small or moderate effects, whereas a large
proportion of risk variants with small effects remains unknown. The
availability of functional annotation data enables us to address the above
challenges. In this study, we propose a latent sparse mixed model (LSMM) to
integrate functional annotations with GWAS data. Not only does it increase
statistical power of the identification of risk variants, but also offers more
biological insights by detecting relevant functional annotations. To allow LSMM
scalable to millions of variants and hundreds of functional annotations, we
developed an efficient variational expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for
model parameter estimation and statistical inference. We first conducted
comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of LSMM. Then we
applied it to analyze 30 GWAS of complex phenotypes integrated with 9 genic
category annotations and 127 tissue-specific functional annotations from the
Roadmap project. The results demonstrate that our method possesses more
statistical power over conventional methods, and can help researchers achieve
deeper understanding of genetic architecture of these complex phenotypes.

periods of $7.9757 \pm 0.0011$, $17.30681^{+0.00034}_{-0.00036}$, and
$25.5715^{+0.0038}_{-0.0040}$ days, and radii of $1.05 \pm 0.16$, $3.14 \pm
0.36$, and $1.55^{+0.24}_{-0.21}$ $R_\oplus$, respectively. With an age of
600-800 Myr, these planets are some of the smallest and youngest transiting
planets known. Due to the relatively bright (J=9.1) host star, the planets are
compelling targets for future characterization via radial velocity mass
measurements and transmission spectroscopy. As the first known star with
multiple transiting planets in a cluster, the system should be helpful for
testing theories of planet formation and migration.

dimensional structure depends critically on the relative geometrical
arrangement of current carrying orbitals. Recent tight-binding orbital models
for spin transport in DNA-like molecules, have surmised that the band
spin-orbit coupling arises from the particular angular relations between
orbitals of neighboring bases on the helical chain. Such arrangement could be
probed by inducing deformations in the molecule in a conductive probe AFM type
setup, as it was recently reported by Kiran, Cohen and Naaman\cite{Kiran}. Here
we report deformation dependent spin selectivity when a double strand DNA model
is compressed or stretched. We find that the equilibrium geometry is not
optimal with respect to the SO coupling strength and thus spin selectivity can
be tuned by deformations. The latter can be increased by stretching the helical
structure taking into account its elastic properties through the Poisson ratio.
The spin filtering gap is also found to be tunable with uniaxial deformations.

outperforms standard matrix factorization using the $\ell_2$-loss, particularly
when outliers are present. The state-of-the-art RMF solver is the RMF-MM
algorithm, which, however, cannot utilize data sparsity. Moreover, sometimes
even the (convex) $\ell_1$-loss is not robust enough. In this paper, we propose
the use of nonconvex loss to enhance robustness. To address the resultant
difficult optimization problem, we use majorization-minimization (MM)
optimization and propose a new MM surrogate. To improve scalability, we exploit
data sparsity and optimize the surrogate via its dual with the accelerated
proximal gradient algorithm. The resultant algorithm has low time and space
complexities and is guaranteed to converge to a critical point. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art in terms of
both accuracy and scalability.

Two functional forms for the coupling functions and the scalar potential were

power-law couplings, the restrictions on stable quintessence and phantom
solutions lead to asymptotic freedom regime for the gravitational interaction.
The model with dimensionless kinetic coupling constant gives stable de Sitter
solutions. For the exponential functions the stable quintessence, phantom or de

coupling can reach either the asymptotic freedom regime or constant value. The
phantom solutions could be realized without appealing to ghost degrees of

learning (ML) methods and the formulation of statistical data assimilation

correspondence is that layer label in the ML setting is the analog of time in
the data assimilation setting. Utilizing aspects of this equivalence we discuss
how to establish the global minimum of the cost functions in the ML context,
using a variational annealing method from DA. This provides a design method for
optimal networks for ML applications and may serve as the basis for
understanding the success of ""deep learning"". Results from an ML example are
presented.
  When the layer label is taken to be continuous, the Euler-Lagrange equation
for the ML optimization problem is an ordinary differential equation, and we
see that the problem being solved is a two point boundary value problem. The
use of continuous layers is denoted ""deepest learning"". The Hamiltonian version
provides a direct rationale for back propagation as a solution method for the
canonical momentum; however, it suggests other solution methods are to be
preferred.

A falsification of the low-energy limit, in the accessible weak-field regime,
would also falsify the full theory of quantum gravity, making it enter the
realm of testable, potentially falsifiable theories, i.e. becoming real physics
after almost a century of pure theorizing. If weak-field gravity between

should apply), we know that gravity then is a strictly classical phenomenon
absent at the quantum level.

maps with those that are images of regular maps. Recall that a map f : R n
$\rightarrow$ R m is regulous if it is a rational map that admits a continuous
extension to R n. In case the set of (real) poles of f is empty we say that it
is regular map. We prove that if S $\subset$ R m is the image of a regulous map
f : R n $\rightarrow$ R m , there exists a dense semialgebraic subset T
$\subset$ S and a regular map g : R n $\rightarrow$ R m such that g(R n) = T.
In case dim(S) = n, we may assume that the difference S \ T has codimension
$\ge$ 2 in S. If we restrict our scope to regulous maps from the plane the
result is neat: if f : R 2 $\rightarrow$ R m is a regulous map, there exists a
regular map g : R 2 $\rightarrow$ R m such that Im(f) = Im(g). In addition, we
provide in the Appendix a regulous and a regular map f, g : R 2 $\rightarrow$ R
2 whose common image is the open quadrant Q := {x > 0, y > 0}. These maps are
much simpler than the best known polynomial maps R 2 $\rightarrow$ R 2 that
have the open quadrant as their image.

photonics and the chromatic dispersion effect is designed and implemented for
weak fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). Due to the effect of dispersion compensation
fiber (DCF), FBG wavelength shift leads to the change of the difference
frequency signal at the mixer. With the way of crossing microwave sweep cycle,
all wavelengths of cascade FBGs can be high speed obtained by measuring the
frequencies change. Moreover, through the introduction of Chirp-Z and Hanning
window algorithm, the analysis of difference frequency signal is achieved very
well. By adopting the single-peak filter as a reference, the length disturbance
of DCF caused by temperature can be also eliminated. Therefore, the accuracy of
this novel method is greatly improved, and high speed demodulation of FBGs can
easily realize. The feasibility and performance are experimentally demonstrated
using 105 FBGs with 0.1% reflectivity, 1 m spatial interval. Results show that
each grating can be distinguished well, and the demodulation rate is as high as
40 kHz, the accuracy is about 8 pm.

with the base station to exchange valuable information. Given the stochastic
elements in radio signal propagation, such as shadowing and fading, and the
possibilities of unpredictable events or hardware failures, communication loss
often presents a significant mission risk, both in terms of probability and
impact, especially in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) operations. Depending on
the circumstances, disconnected robots are either abandoned or attempt to
autonomously back-trace their way to the base station. Although recent results
in Communication-Aware Motion Planning can be used to effectively manage
connectivity with robots, there are no results focusing on autonomously
re-establishing the wireless connectivity of a mobile robot without
back-tracking or using detailed a priori information of the network.
  In this paper, we present a robust and online radio signal mapping method
using Gaussian Random Fields and propose a Resilient Communication-Aware Motion
Planner (RCAMP) that integrates the above signal mapping framework with a
motion planner. RCAMP considers both the environment and the physical
constraints of the robot, based on the available sensory information. We also
propose a self-repair strategy using RCMAP, that takes both connectivity and
the goal position into account when driving to a connection-safe position in
the event of a communication loss. We demonstrate the proposed planner in a set
of realistic simulations of an exploration task in single or multi-channel
communication scenarios.

non-gauge interactions and with the introduction of an electromagnetic field as
a linear combination of fields on which various gauge groups are implemented,
are analyzed. It is noticed that the existing model contains $U\left( 1
\right)-$ phase uncertainty of the matrix elements of the raising and lowering
generators of the $SU\left( 2 \right)$ group. This uncertainty creates the
condition for the additional local $U\left( 1 \right)-$ symmetry of the
Standard Model Lagrangian with respect to the choice of various equivalent
generator representations of the $SU\left( 2 \right)$ group, which is provided
by the electromagnetic field. In this case, due to the different action of the
raising and lowering generators on the fields of each generation of leptons and
quarks, these fields interact with the electromagnetic field in different ways.
It is also shown that considering the multi-particle gauge field a description
of the Higgs mechanism can be obtained, free from the shortcomings of the
well-known single-particle description, the main of which is the introduction
of the non-gauge ""phi-four"" interaction, that is not reduced to the fundamental
one. In the proposed model, the spontaneous symmetry breaking is achieved due
to the same fundamental interaction, the mediating particle mass of which it
provides.

a derivative must be fulfilled immediately. This feature of derivatives
prevents claims processing procedures that screen out ineligible claims. This,
in turn, creates a perverse incentive for insured holders of notes to commit
acts that result in payment. This problem first surfaced with CDS contracts,
which are part of a class of loan insurance I term a default insurance note.
  Without an address to this problem, within the average range of returns for a
large venture capital portfolio, a venture-bank makes less money the better
their investments do, in a continuous function. The highest rate of return is a
total loss, 64% more than a top portfolio.
  Here, a strategy for removing this perverse incentive is defined, consisting
of a clawback lien that returns part of the payment value as a lien on the firm
that is the beneficiary of the insurance. This is presented as the final major
component for implementing a default insurance note system so that
venture-banking can operate to maximum benefit. Removing the perverse incentive
also minimizes disincentive for underwriters to deny DIN coverage to new
venture capital firms, or to those firms that have historical earnings which
are below average.

We consider a finite quantum theory (FQT) based on finite mathematics and prove
that standard continuous quantum theory is a special case of FQT in the formal
limit $p\to\infty$. The description of states in standard quantum theory
contains a big redundancy of elements: the theory is based on real numbers
while with any desired accuracy the states can be described by using only
integers, i.e. rational and real numbers play only auxiliary role. Therefore,
in FQT infinities cannot exist in principle, FQT is based on a more fundamental
mathematics than standard quantum theory and the description of states in FQT
is much more thrifty than in standard quantum theory. Space and time are purely
classical notions and are not present in FQT at all. In the present paper we
discuss how classical equations of motions arise as a consequence of the fact
that $p$ changes, i.e. $p$ is the evolution parameter. It is shown that there
exist scenarios when classical equations of motion for cosmological
acceleration and gravity can be formulated exclusively in terms of quantum
quantities without using space, time and standard semiclassical approximation.

however, has been the realization of robust, device-compatible single photon
sources that can be activated and controlled on demand. Here we use strain
engineering to create large arrays of quantum emitters in two-dimensional
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The large energy gap inherent to this Van der
Waals material stabilizes the emitters at room temperature within nanoscale
regions defined by substrate-induced deformation of the flake. Combining
analytical and numerical modeling we show that emitter activation is likely the
result of carrier trapping in deformation potential wells localized near the
points where the hBN flake reaches the highest curvature. These findings,
therefore, hint at novel opportunities for the manipulation of single photon
sources through the combined control of strain and external electrostatic
potentials under ambient conditions.
