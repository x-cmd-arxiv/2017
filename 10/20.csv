time-dependent ligand-receptor interactions for applications in biosensing
using field effect transistors (FET). The model describes biochemical
interactions at the sensor surface (or biochemical gate) located at the bottom
of a solution-well, which result in a time-dependent change in the FET
conductance. It was shown that one can exploit the disparate length scales of
the solution-well and biochemical gate to reduce the coupled PDE model to a
single nonlinear integrodifferential equation (IDE) that describes the
concentration of reacting species. Although this equation has a convolution
integral with a singular kernel, a numerical approximation was constructed by
applying the method of lines. The need for specialized quadrature techniques
was obviated and numerical evidence strongly suggests that this method achieves
first-order accuracy. Results reveal a depletion region on the biochemical
gate, which non-uniformly alters the surface potential of the semiconductor.

configuration, one can both create and accelerate electron-positron pairs. The
new particles are generated in the laser focus and gain relativistic momentum
in the direction of laser propagation. Short focal length is an advantage, as
it allows the particles to be ejected from the focal region with a net energy
gain in vacuum. Electron-positron beams obtained in this setup have a low
divergence, are quasi-neutral and spatially separated from the initial electron
beam. The pairs attain multi-GeV energies which are not limited by the maximum
energy of the initial electron beam. We present an analytical model for the
expected energy cutoff, supported by 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations.
The experimental implications, such as the sensitivity to temporal
synchronisation and laser duration is assessed to provide guidance for the

exoplanets in the habitable zone of their host stars. With solid tides, they
torque these planets, thus contributing to determine their rotation states as
well as their climate. Given the complex dynamics of thermal tides, analytical
models are essential to understand its dependence on the structure and rotation
of planetary atmospheres and the tidal frequency. In this context, the state of
the art model proposed in the 60's by Lindzen and Chapman explains well the
properties of thermal tides in the asymptotic regime of Earth-like rapid
rotators but predicts a non-physical diverging tidal torque in the vicinity of
the spin-orbit synchronization. In this work, we present a new model that
addresses this issue by taking into account dissipative processes through a
Newtonian cooling. First, we recover the tidal torque recently obtained with
numerical simulations using General Circulation Models (GCM). Second, we show
that the tidal response is very sensitive to the atmospheric structure,
particularly to the stability with respect to convection. A strong stable
stratification is able to annihilate the atmospheric tidal torque, leading to
synchronization, while a convective atmosphere will be submitted to a strong
torque, leading to a non-synchronized rotation state.

researchers to generate realistic approximations of graphs. While in the past,
focus was on generating graphs which follow general laws, such as the power law
for degree distribution, current models have the ability to learn from observed
graphs and generate synthetic approximations. The primary emphasis of existing
models has been to closely match different properties of a single observed
graph. Such models, though stochastic, tend to generate samples which do not
have significant variance in terms of the various graph properties. We argue
that in many cases real graphs are sampled drawn from a graph population (e.g.,
networks sampled at various time points, social networks for individual
schools, healthcare networks for different geographic regions, etc.). Such
populations typically exhibit significant variance. However, existing models
are not designed to model this variance, which could lead to issues such as
overfitting. We propose a graph generative model that focuses on matching the
properties of real graphs and the natural variance expected for the
corresponding population. The proposed model adopts a mixture-model strategy to
expand the expressiveness of Kronecker product based graph models (KPGM), while
building upon the two strengths of KPGM, viz., ability to model several key
properties of graphs and to scale to massive graph sizes using its elegant
fractal growth based formulation. The proposed model, called x-Kronecker
Product Graph Model, or xKPGM, allows scalable learning from observed graphs
and generates samples that match the mean and variance of several salient graph
properties. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the proposed model
to capture the inherent variability in real world graphs on a variety of
publicly available graph data sets.

crossbar switch architecture. Such a switch needs to compute a matching
(crossbar schedule) between the input ports and output ports during each
switching cycle (time slot). A key research challenge in designing large (in
number of input/output ports $N$) input-queued crossbar switches is to develop
crossbar scheduling algorithms that can compute ""high quality"" matchings --
i.e., those that result in high switch throughput (ideally $100\%$) and low
queueing delays for packets -- at line rates. SERENA is one such algorithm: it
outputs excellent matching decisions that result in $100\%$ switch throughput
and reasonably good queueing delays. However, since SERENA is a centralized
algorithm with $O(N)$ computational complexity, it cannot support switches that
both are large and have a very high line rate per port. In this work, we
propose SERENADE (SERENA, the Distributed Edition), a parallel iterative
algorithm that emulates SERENA in only $O(\log N)$ iterations between input
ports and output ports, and hence has a time complexity of only $O(\log N)$ per
port. We prove that SERENADE can exactly emulate SERENA. We also propose an
early-stop version of SERENADE, called O-SERENADE, to only approximately
emulate SERENA. Through extensive simulations, we show that O-SERENADE can
achieve 100\% throughput and that it has similar as or slightly better delay
performance than SERENA under various load conditions and traffic patterns.

Several works have addressed the challenge of creating precise dense 3D maps
from visual sensors providing depth information. However, during operation over
longer missions, reconstructions can easily become inconsistent due to
accumulated camera tracking error and delayed loop closure. Without explicitly
addressing the problem of map consistency, recovery from such distortions tends
to be difficult. We present a novel system for dense 3D mapping which addresses
the challenge of building consistent maps while dealing with scalability.
Central to our approach is the representation of the environment as a
collection of overlapping TSDF subvolumes. These subvolumes are localized
through feature-based camera tracking and bundle adjustment. Our main
contribution is a pipeline for identifying stable regions in the map, and to
fuse the contributing subvolumes. This approach allows us to reduce map growth
while still maintaining consistency. We demonstrate the proposed system on a
publicly available dataset and simulation engine, and demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach for building consistent and scalable maps. Finally we
demonstrate our approach running in real-time on-board a lightweight MAV.

nanoscale devices is efficient and widely applicable but not suited to
transient phenomena and time dependent currents because it assumes that the
charge carrier population attains a time independent dynamic equilibrium as
soon as the external voltage is turned on. In this article, we construct a very
general expression for a time dependent current in an
electrode-molecule-electrode arrangement. Utilizing a model Hamiltonian, we
propagate the Schrodinger wave function equation to numerically compute the
time dependent population in the individual sub-systems. The current in each
electrode (defined in terms of the rate of change of the corresponding
population) has two components, one due to the charges originating from the
same electrode and the other due to the charges initially residing at the other
electrode. We derive an analytical expression for the first component and
illustrate that it agrees reasonably with the numerical counterpart at early
times. The structural form reveals that the initial occupancy can be factored
out of the time dependent segment of the expression. We take this cue to
construct a Landauer style formula and demonstrate that the current obtained
from this simplified formula overlaps with our most general numerical current
only after the charge flow settles into a steady state. Thus, we illustrate the
emergence of Landauer transport from a true first-principles quantum dynamics
calculation without any prior assumptions. Subsequently, we investigate the
ingredients in our model that regulate the onset time scale of this Landauer
regime. We compare the performance of our general current expression with the
Landauer current for time dependent electronic coupling. Finally, we comment on
the applicability of the Landauer formulas to compute hot-electron current
arising upon plasmon decoherence.

Fourier-based solution that contains the drastic growth due to the

of studying the projection method where the cut-off approach is derived
consistently. In the theoretical framework, the first two objectives are to
construct the regularized problem and prove its stability for each noise level.
Our second interest is estimating the error in $L^2$-norm. Another
supplementary objective is computing the eigen-elements. All in all, this paper
can be considered as a preliminary attempt to solve the heating/cooling of a

provided to corroborate the qualitative analysis.

slowly as a function of the $F$-layer thickness than for similar spin-singlet

that the calculated Fermi sea contributions are rather small and the

ultra-high energy and extracting details about mass composition. This is done
using the time profiles of the signals recorded with the water-Cherenkov
detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The profiles arise from a mix of the
muon and electromagnetic components of air-showers. Using the risetimes of the
recorded signals we define a new parameter, which we use to compare our
observations with predictions from simulations. We find, firstly,
inconsistencies between our data and predictions over a greater energy range
and with substantially more events than in previous studies. Secondly, by
calibrating the new parameter with fluorescence measurements from observations
made at the Auger Observatory, we can infer the depth of shower maximum for a
sample of over 81,000 events extending from 0.3 EeV to over 100 EeV. Above 30
EeV, the sample is nearly fourteen times larger than currently available from
fluorescence measurements and extending the covered energy range by half a
decade. The energy dependence of the average depth of shower maximum is
compared to simulations and interpreted in terms of the mean of the logarithmic
mass. We find good agreement with previous work and extend the measurement of
the mean depth of shower maximum to greater energies than before, reducing
significantly the statistical uncertainty associated with the inferences about
mass composition.

these searches, imposing significant constraints on the parameter space of
different new physics models with an extended Higgs sector. Here we discuss an
alternative search strategy for heavy Higgs bosons decaying invisibly at the

pseudoscalar $A$, through the production mode $q \bar q \to Z^\ast \to HA$. We
identify as the most promising signal the final state made up of $4b +
E_T^\text{miss}$, coming from the heavy scalar decay mode $H \to hh \to b \bar
b b \bar b$, with $h$ being the discovered SM-like Higgs boson with $m_h=125$
GeV, together with the invisible channel of the pseudoscalar. We work within
the context of simplified MSSM scenarios that contain quite heavy sfermions of
most types with ${\cal O}(10)$ TeV masses, while the stops are heavy enough to
reproduce the 125 GeV mass for the lightest SM-like Higgs boson. By contrast,
the gauginos/higgsinos and the heavy MSSM Higgs bosons have masses near the EW
scale. Our search strategies, for a LHC center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =$
14 TeV, allow us to obtain statistical significances of the signal over the SM

error-correcting codes. Yet this success comes in spite of some harsh
limitations on the ability of these codes to fault-tolerantly compute. Here we
introduce a new metric for these codes, the disjointness, which, roughly
speaking, is the number of mostly non-overlapping representatives of any given
non-trivial logical Pauli operator. We use the disjointness to prove that
transversal gates on error-detecting stabilizer codes are necessarily in a
finite level of the Clifford hierarchy. We also apply our techniques to
topological code families to find similar bounds on the level of the hierarchy
attainable by constant depth circuits, regardless of their geometric locality.
For instance, we can show that symmetric 2D surface codes cannot have non-local
constant depth circuits for non-Clifford gates.

deblending, MUSE provides unique multiplex capabilities in crowded stellar
fields and allows us to acquire samples of up to 20 000 stars within the
half-light radius of each cluster. The present paper focuses on the analysis of
the internal dynamics of 22 out of the 25 clusters, using about 500 000 spectra
of 200 000 individual stars. Thanks to the large stellar samples per cluster,
we are able to perform a detailed analysis of the central rotation and
dispersion fields using both radial profiles and two-dimensional maps. The
velocity dispersion profiles we derive show a good general agreement with
existing radial velocity studies but typically reach closer to the cluster
centres. By comparison with proper motion data we derive or update the
dynamical distance estimates to 14 clusters. Compared to previous dynamical
distance estimates for 47 Tuc, our value is in much better agreement with other
methods. We further find significant (>3sigma) rotation in the majority (13/22)
of our clusters. Our analysis seems to confirm earlier findings of a link
between rotation and the ellipticities of globular clusters. In addition, we
find a correlation between the strengths of internal rotation and the
relaxation times of the clusters, suggesting that the central rotation fields
are relics of the cluster formation that are gradually dissipated via two-body
relaxation.

are ubiquitous. The adjacency matrix is often adopted to represent a network,
which is usually high dimensional and sparse. However, to apply advanced
machine learning algorithms to network data, low-dimensional and continuous
representations are desired. To achieve this goal, many network embedding
methods have been proposed recently. The majority of existing methods
facilitate the local information i.e. local connections between nodes, to learn
the representations, while completely neglecting global information (or node
status), which has been proven to boost numerous network mining tasks such as
link prediction and social recommendation. Hence, it also has potential to
advance network embedding. In this paper, we study the problem of preserving
local and global information for network embedding. In particular, we introduce
an approach to capture global information and propose a network embedding
framework LOG, which can coherently model {\bf LO}cal and {\bf G}lobal
information. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to preserve global
information of the proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of learned representations of the proposed

expressed in terms of the standard $lm\omega$ modes of the scalar field (those
associated with a spherical harmonic $Y_{lm}$ and a temporal mode $e^{-i\omega

equation, the radial equation. These explicit expressions are the internal
analogs of the well known results in the external region (originally derived by
Christensen and Fulling), in which the two-point function outside the black

allow the computation of $<\Phi^{2}>_{ren}$ and the renormalized stress-energy
tensor inside the black hole, after the radial equation has been solved

expression for the trace of the renormalized stress-energy tensor of a
minimally-coupled massless scalar field (which is non-conformal), relating it
to the d'Alembertian of $<\Phi^{2}>_{ren}$. This expression proves itself
useful in various calculations of the renormalized stress-energy tensor.

of galaxy formation models. Although the coronae around spiral galaxies offer a
fundamental test of these models, observational constraints on their
characteristics are still scarce. While the presence of extended hot coronae
has been established around a handful of massive spiral galaxies, the short
X-ray observations only allowed for measurements of the basic characteristics
of the coronae. In this work, we utilize deep XMM-Newton observations of NGC
6753 to explore its extended X-ray corona in unprecedented detail.
Specifically, we establish the isotropic morphology of the hot gas, suggesting
that it resides in hydrostatic equilibrium. The temperature profile of the gas
shows a decrease with increasing radius: it drops from $kT\approx0.7$ keV in
the innermost parts to $kT\approx0.4$ keV at 50 kpc radius. The temperature map
reveals the complex temperature structure of the gas. We study the metallicity
distribution of the gas, which is uniform at $Z\approx0.1$ Solar. This value is
about an order of magnitude lower than that obtained for elliptical galaxies
with similar dark matter halo mass, hinting that the hot gas in spiral galaxies
predominantly originates from external gas inflows rather than from internal
sources. By extrapolating the density profile of the hot gas out to the virial
radius, we estimate the total gas mass and derive the total baryon mass of NGC
6753. We conclude that the baryon mass fraction is $f_{\rm b} \approx 0.06$,
implying that about half of the baryons are missing.

reveals distinct density/column density regimes (nH~100, 500, and >1000 cm-3),

after discovery. The radio data were obtained with the VLA as part of a
long-term program to monitor the energy and dynamical evolution of the
relativistic jet and to characterize the parsec-scale environment around a
previously dormant supermassive black hole. We combine these data with
$\textit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations and demonstrate that the X-ray emission
following the sharp decline at $\delta t \approx 500$ d is due to the forward
shock. Using the X-ray data, in conjunction with optical/NIR data, we constrain
the synchrotron cooling frequency and the microphysical properties of the
outflow for the first time. We find that the cooling frequency evolves through
the optical/NIR band at $\delta t \approx 10 - 200$ d, corresponding to a
magnetic field energy density fraction of $\epsilon_B \approx 10^{-3}$, well
below equipartition; the X-ray data demonstrate that this deviation from
equipartition holds to at least $\delta t \approx 2000$ d. We thus recalculate
the physical properties of the jet over the lifetime of the event, no longer
assuming equipartition. We find a total kinetic energy of $E_K \approx 4 \times
10^{51}$ erg and a transition to non-relativistic expansion on the timescale of
our latest observations ($\delta t \approx 700$ d). The density profile is
approximately $R^{-3/2}$ at $\lesssim 0.3$ pc and $\gtrsim 0.7$ pc, with a
plateau at intermediate scales, characteristic of Bondi accretion. Based on its

Among 205 candidates selected in the test set, 178 are real variables, 13

distribution (HOD) prescription which allows a redshift dependence of galaxy
number density. To make a fairer comparison between the $f(R)$ and $\Lambda$CDM
models, their HOD parameters are tuned so that the galaxy two-point correlation
functions in real space (and therefore the projected two-point correlation
functions) match. While the $f(R)$ model predicts an enhancement of the
convergence power spectrum by up to $\sim30\%$ compared to the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model with the same parameters, the maximum enhancement of GGL is
only half as large and less than 5\% on separations above $\sim1$-$2h^{-1}$Mpc,
because the latter is a cross correlation of shear (or matter, which is more
strongly affected by modified gravity) and galaxy (which is weakly affected
given the good match between galaxy auto correlations in the two models)
fields. We also study the possibility of reconstructing the matter power
spectrum by combination of GGL and galaxy clustering in $f(R)$ gravity. We find
that the galaxy-matter cross correlation coefficient remains at unity down to

joint analysis of GGL and galaxy clustering can be a powerful probe of matter
density fluctuations in chameleon gravity. The scale dependence of the model

help determine the ionization state of most intergalactic and circumgalactic

extremely difficult to probe observationally due to absorption from the Galaxy.
In this paper, we model the contributions of various sources to the cosmic EUV

interstellar and circumgalactic emission potentially contribute tens of percent
to these backgrounds at all redshifts. We estimate that uncertainties in the
angular-averaged background intensity impact the ionization corrections for

the same IMF for all galaxies and the stellar M/L ratio within each galaxy is
constant. This correlation may indicate that, in fact, the IMF is more
dwarf-rich for galaxies with large $\sigma$. We use this correlation to
estimate a dynamical or IMF-corrected stellar mass, $M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}}$,
from $M_{*}$ and $\sigma_e$ for a sample of $6 \times 10^5$ SDSS galaxies for
which spatially resolved kinematics is not available. We also compute the
`virial' mass estimate $k(n,R)\,R_e\,\sigma_R^2/G$, where $n$ is the Sersic
index, in the SDSS and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ samples. We show that an $n$-dependent
correction must be applied to the $k(n,R)$ values provided by Prugniel & Simien
(1997). Our analysis also shows that the shape of the velocity dispersion
profile in the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ sample varies weakly with $n$:
$(\sigma_R/\sigma_e) = (R/R_e)^{-\gamma(n)}$. The resulting stellar mass
functions, based on $M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}}$ and the recalibrated virial mass,
are in good agreement. If the $M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}}/M_* - \sigma_e$
correlation is indeed due to the IMF, and stellar M/L gradients can be ignored,
then our $\phi(M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}})$ is an estimate of the stellar mass
function in which $\sigma_e$-dependent variations in the IMF across the
population have been accounted for. Using a Fundamental Plane based
observational proxy for $\sigma_e$ produces comparable results. By
demonstrating that cheaper proxies are sufficiently accurate, our analysis
should enable a more reliable census of the mass in stars for large galaxy
samples, at a fraction of the cost. Our results are provided in tabular form.

important for a wide range of experiments in fundamental and applied

superconducting-ion-chip spectroscopy of neutral ions and Rydberg states.
Moreover, atom-like centers close to the surface are currently believed to be
the main source of noise and decoherence in qubits based on superconducting
devices. The proximity effect is known to dress atomic orbitals in
Cooper-pair-like states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states (YSR), but the impact
of SC on the measured orbital splittings and optical/noise transitions is not
known. Here we study the interplay between orbital degenerescence and particle
number admixture in atomic states, beyond the usual classical spin
approximation. We model the atom as a generalized Anderson model interacting
with a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. In the limit of zero on-site
Coulomb repulsion ($U=0$), we obtain YSR subgap energy levels that are
identical to the ones obtained from the classical spin model. When $\Delta$ is
large and $U>0$, the YSR spectra is no longer quasiparticle-like, and the
highly degenerate orbital subspaces are split according to their spin, orbital,
and number-parity symmetry. We show that $U>0$ activates additional poles in
the atomic Green's function, suggesting an alternative explanation for the peak
splittings recently observed in scanning tunneling microscopy of
orbitally-degenerate impurities in superconductors. We describe optical
excitation and absorption of photons by YSR states, showing that many
additional optical channels open up in comparison to the non-superconducting
case. Conversely, the additional dissipation channels imply increased

gauge theory, is identical to the spectrum of the free gravitational theory in
the global AdS spacetime under some assumptions which are expected to be valid.
Thus, two theories are equivalent for the low energy region under the
assumptions. Using this equivalence, the bulk local field is constructed and
the GKPW relation is derived.

various relationships between plot elements and examine characteristics like

facilitate the training of machine learning systems, the corpus also includes

faint magnitudes, however, these samples are highly incomplete for galaxies

conduct simultaneous maximum-likelihood estimation of LF and RL relation

of a completeness map as a function of size and luminosity. At $z\sim6-7$, we
find that the intrinsic RL relation expressed as $r_\textrm{e} \propto L^\beta$

redshifts, which in turn implies that the LF has a relatively shallow faint-end
slope of $\alpha=-1.86^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$. This steep $\beta$ can be reproduced
by a simple analytical model in which smaller galaxies have lower specific
angular momenta. The $\beta$ and $\alpha$ values for the $z\sim8$ and 9 samples

habitability of a planet. Orbital modulations caused by planetary companions
and the planet's spin axis precession due to the torque from the host star may
lead to resonant interactions and cause large-amplitude obliquity variability.
Here we consider the spin axis dynamics of Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f, both of
which reside in the habitable zone around their host stars. Using
{\emph{N}}-body simulations and secular numerical integrations, we describe
their obliquity evolution for particular realizations of the planetary systems.
We then use a generalized analytic framework to characterize regions in
parameter space where the obliquity is variable with large amplitude. We find
that the locations of variability are fine-tuned over the planetary properties
and system architecture in the lower-obliquity regimes ($\lesssim 40^\circ$).
As an example, assuming a rotation period of 24 hr, the obliquities of both
Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f are stable below $\sim 40^\circ$, whereas the
high-obliquity regions ($60^\circ - 90^\circ$) allow moderate variabilities.
However, for some other rotation periods of Kepler-62f or Kepler-186f, the
lower-obliquity regions could become more variable owing to resonant
interactions. Even small deviations from coplanarity (e.g. mutual inclinations
$\sim 3^\circ$) could stir peak-to-peak obliquity variations up to $\sim
20^\circ$. Undetected planetary companions and/or the existence of a satellite
could also destabilize the low-obliquity regions. In all cases, the
high-obliquity region allows for moderate variations, and all obliquities
corresponding to retrograde motion (i.e. $> 90^\circ$) are stable.

computing' to formulate a method for model-free estimation from data of the
Lyapunov exponents of a chaotic process. The technique uses a limited time
series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a
'reservoir'. After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear
regression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the 'output
weights'. The learned output weights are then used to form a modified
autonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing arbitrarily long time
series whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When
successful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's
'climate'. Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can
compute derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the
autonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents
for the original input generating system. We illustrate the effectiveness of
our technique with two examples, the Lorenz system, and the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation. In particular, we use the Lorenz system to
show that achieving climate reproduction may require tuning of the reservoir
parameters. For the case of the KS equation, we note that as the system's
spatial size is increased, the number of Lyapunov exponents increases, thus
yielding a challenging test of our method, which we find the method
successfully passes.

composed of electron-positron pairs. The free expansion of the wind terminates
far from the neutron star where a weakly magnetized pulsar wind nebula forms,
implying efficient magnetic dissipation somewhere upstream. The wind current
sheet that separates the two magnetic polarities is usually considered as the
most natural place for magnetic dissipation via relativistic reconnection, but
its efficiency remains an open question. Here, the goal of this work is to
revisit this issue in light of the most recent progress in the understanding of
reconnection and pulsar electrodynamics. We perform large two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations of the oblique rotator to capture the multi-scale
evolution of the wind. We find that the current sheet breaks up into a
dynamical chain of magnetic islands separated by secondary thin current sheets.
The sheet thickness increases linearly with radius while the Poynting flux
decreases monotonically as reconnection proceeds. The radius of complete
annihilation of the stripes is given by the plasma multiplicity parameter at
the light cylinder. Current starvation within the sheets does not occur before
complete dissipation as long as there is enough charges where the sheets form.
Particles are efficiently heated up to a characteristic energy set by the
magnetization parameter at the light cylinder. Energetic pulsed synchrotron
emission peaks close to the light cylinder, and presents sub-pulse variability
associated with the formation of plasmoids in the sheet. This study suggests
that the striped component of the wind dissipates far before reaching the
termination shock in isolated pulsars, even in very-high-multiplicity systems
such as the Crab pulsar. Pulsars in binary systems may provide the best
environments to study magnetic dissipation in the wind.

After elaborating on the over-damped regime of stochastic dynamics, we
introduce an effective average action for the stochastic field, resulting by
progressively integrating out frequencies, and study its flow equation in the
local potential approximation (LPA). This effective action determines the
approach to equilibrium and allows for the computation of unequal time
correlators $\left\langle\phi(t)\phi(t+\Delta t)\right\rangle$ for large values
of $\Delta t$. The stochastic RG flow in the LPA can be formulated in two ways,
one that preserves the stochastic supersymmetry and one that breaks it. We show
that both predict a characteristic decay time very close to that determined by
the dynamical mass for a massless self-interacting scalar in de Sitter $m^2\sim
\sqrt{\lambda}H^2$. Furthermore, the temporal supersymmetric formulation
remarkably recovers the flow for the effective potential found using Quantum
Field Theory methods and a smoothing over spatial wavelengths. We also discuss
how the stochastic framework generically predicts an infrared mass which is a
few percent smaller than the dynamical mass obtained in the LPA. Our results
further support the notion that stochastic inflation captures the correct IR
dynamics of light scalar fields in inflation.

Existing generative adversarial networks are not ideal in ensuring global

process into two conditional stages. In the first stage, we generate a
plausible semantic segmentation map that obeys the wearer's pose as a latent
spatial arrangement. An effective spatial constraint is formulated to guide the
generation of this semantic segmentation map. In the second stage, a generative
model with a newly proposed compositional mapping layer is used to render the
final image with precise regions and textures conditioned on this map. We
extended the DeepFashion dataset [8] by collecting sentence descriptions for
79K images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through both

the galactic center. This doubles the existing detection of such extended hot
CGM around massive spiral galaxies. The radial soft X-ray intensity profile of
hot gas can be fitted with a $\beta$-function with the slope typically in the
range of $\beta=0.35-0.55$. This range, as well as those $\beta$ values
measured for other massive spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way (MW), are
in general consistent with X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies of similar hot
gas luminosity and temperature, and with those predicted from a hydrostatic
isothermal gaseous halo. Hot gas in such massive spiral galaxy tends to have
temperature comparable to its virial value, indicating the importance of
gravitational heating. This is in contrast to lower mass galaxies where hot gas
temperature tends to be systematically higher than the virial one. The ratio of
the radiative cooling to free fall timescales of hot gas is much larger than
the critical value of $\sim10$ throughout the entire halos of all the CGM-MASS
galaxies, indicating the inefficiency of gas cooling and precipitation in the
CGM. The hot CGM in these massive spiral galaxies is thus most likely in a
hydrostatic state, with the feedback material mixed with the CGM, instead of
escaping out of the halo or falling back to the disk. We also homogenize and

[HS17a] in the study of codes for correcting insertion and deletion errors
(insdel codes). A synchronization string is an encoding of the indices of the
symbols in a string, and together with an appropriate decoding algorithm it can
transform insertion and deletion errors into standard symbol erasures and
corruptions. This reduces the problem of constructing insdel codes to the
problem of constructing standard error correcting codes, which is much better
understood. Besides this, synchronization strings are also useful in other
applications such as synchronization sequences and interactive coding schemes.
  Amazingly, [HS17a] showed that for any error parameter $\varepsilon>0$,
synchronization strings of arbitrary length exist over an alphabet whose size
depends only on $\varepsilon$. Specifically, they obtained an alphabet size of
$O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, as well as a randomized construction that runs in
expected time $O(n^5)$. However, it remains an interesting question to find
deterministic and more efficient constructions.
  In this paper, we improve the construction in [HS17a] in three aspects: we
achieve a smaller alphabet size, a deterministic construction, and a faster
algorithm. Along the way we introduce a new combinatorial object, and establish
a new connection between synchronization strings and insdel codes --- such
codes can be used in a simple way to construct synchronization strings. This
new connection complements the connection found in [HS17a], and may be of
independent interest. In an independent work [HS17c], Haeupler and Shahrasbi
also give deterministic constructions of synchronization strings over arbitrary
length (or even infinite length). Their constructions can achieve linear
construction time, but have alphabet size $\varepsilon^{-O(1)}$, which may be
larger than ours.

energetic properties of the CME using the ice-cream cone model for its
three-dimensional structure in combination with the observed profile of the
hydrogen column density decline with time. Different physically justified
length scales were used that allowed us to estimate lower and upper limits of
the possible CME characteristics. Further consideration of the maximum
available magnetic energy in starspots leads us to quantify its mass as likely
lying in the range $2\times 10^{21}$-$2\times 10^{22}$ g and kinetic energy in
the range $7\times 10^{35}$-$3\times 10^{38}$ erg. The results are in

stochastic process modeling the spread of genetic mutations in populations. In
this process, agents of a two-type population (i.e. mutants and residents) are
associated with the vertices of a graph. Initially, only one vertex chosen
uniformly at random is a mutant, with fitness $r > 0$, while all other
individuals are residents, with fitness $1$. In every step, an individual is
chosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its state (mutant or
resident) is passed on to a neighbor which is chosen uniformly at random. In
this paper, we introduce and study a generalization of the model of Lieberman

through different graphs, namely $G_R(V,E_R)$ for residents and $G_M(V,E_M)$
for mutants. In this model, we study the fixation probability, i.e. the
probability that eventually only mutants remain in the population, for various
pairs of graphs. First, we transfer known results from the original
single-graph model of Lieberman et al. to our 2-graph model. Among them, we
provide a generalization of the Isothermal Theorem of Lieberman et al., that
gives sufficient conditions for a pair of graphs to have the same fixation
probability as a pair of cliques. Next, we give a 2-player strategic game view
of the process where player payoffs correspond to fixation and/or extinction
probabilities. In this setting, we attempt to identify best responses for each
player and give evidence that the clique is the most beneficial graph for both

strength decreases with increasing specimen size, and can be fitted well by
Bazant's Size Effect Law (SEL). It is shown that SEL accounts for the effects

received much attention for solving large-scale structured optimization
problems arising from many applied areas such as signal processing and machine
learning. In this paper we will discuss in detail the convergence analysis of
the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in Banach spaces. Two ways of the selections of the
stepsizes are discussed: the line minimization search method and the open loop
rule. In both cases, we prove the convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in
the case where the objective function $f$ has uniformly continuous (on bounded
sets) Fr\'echet derivative $f'$. We introduce the notion of the curvature
constant of order $\sigma\in (1,2]$ and obtain the rate
$O(\frac{1}{k^{\sigma-1}})$ of convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. In
particular, this rate reduces to $O(\frac{1}{k^{\nu}})$ if $f'$ is
$\nu$-H\""older continuous for $\nu\in (0,1]$, and to $O(\frac{1}{k})$ if $f'$
is Lipschitz continuous. A generalized Frank-Wolfe algorithm is also introduced
to address the problem of minimizing a composite objective function.
Convergence of iterates of both Frank-Wolfe and generalized Frank-Wolfe

bounding boxes from KITTI. To obtain extra training data, we built a LiDAR

large amounts of realistic training data. Our experiments show that SqueezeSeg
achieves high accuracy with astonishingly fast and stable runtime (8.7 ms per

additionally training on synthesized data boosts validation accuracy on
real-world data. Our source code and synthesized data will be open-sourced.

very small amplitude. Generalizing our work in the diatomic case, we allow the
nonlinearity in the spring forces to have the more complicated form ""quadratic

phrase the long wave problem, and these operators require delicate estimates
due to the characteristic superposition of function types from Beale's ansatz.
Unlike the diatomic case, the value of the leading order term in the traveling
wave profiles alternates between particle sites, so that the spring dimer

To negate the effects of these artefacts, it is desirable for polarization

conducted an experimental test of gravitational time dilation. This
relativistic effect, highlighted in the movie Interstellar, causes clocks to
tick more slowly near massive objects. A measurement of gravitational time
dilation was made by comparing signals generated by a GPS frequency standard,
which is based on sea-level time, to a cesium-beam frequency standard located
at three different elevations above sea level. The effect is small but
observable; for the highest elevation studied (4302 m on the summit of Pikes
Peak), a local clock ticks only 41 ns/day faster than a sea-level clock. Our
results are consistent with the predictions of general relativity. We also

flux from a light source to define the coherence of an illumination. Even when
coherent flux is sufficient, the stability required during an exposure is
another important limiting factor. Partial coherence analysis can considerably
reduce these limitations. A partially coherent illumination can often be
written as the superposition of a single coherent illumination convolved with a
separable translational kernel. In this paper we propose the Gradient
Decomposition of the Probe (GDP), a model that exploits translational kernel
separability, coupling the variances of the kernel with the transverse
coherence. We describe an efficient first-order splitting algorithm GDP-ADMM to
solve the proposed nonlinear optimization problem. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Gaussian and binary
kernel functions in fly-scan measurements. Remarkably, GDP-ADMM produces
satisfactory results even when the ratio between kernel width and beam size is
more than one, or when the distance between successive acquisitions is twice as
large as the beam width.

Comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/sty1515",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the dynamical state of cores by using a simple analytical model, a
sample of observational massive cores, and numerical simulations of collapsing
massive cores. From the model, we find that, if cores are formed from turbulent
compressions, they evolve from small to large column densities, increasing
their velocity dispersion as they collapse, while they tend to equipartition
between gravity and kinetic energy.
  From the observational sample, we find that: (a) cores with substantially
different column densities in the sample do not follow a Larson-like
linewidth-size relation. Instead, cores with higher column densities tend to be
located in the upper-left corner of the Larson velocity dispersion-size
diagram, a result predicted previously (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011a). (b)
The data exhibit cores with overvirial values.
  Finally, in the simulations we reproduce the behavior depicted by the model
and observational sample: cores evolve towards larger velocity dispersions and
smaller sizes as they collapse and increase their column density. However,
collapsing cores appear to approach overvirial states within a free-fall time.
The cause of this apparent excess of kinetic energy is an underestimation of
the gravitational energy, due to the assumption that the gravitational energy
is given by the energy of an isolated sphere of constant column density. This
excess disappears when the gravitational energy is correctly calculated from
the actual spatial mass distribution, where inhomogeneities, as well as the
potential due to the mass outside of the core, also contribute to the
gravitational energy. We conclude that the observed energy budget of cores in
surveys is consistent with their non-thermal motions being driven by their
self-gravity and in a hierarchical and chaotic collapse.

computing the exact functional form of the leading error term in a large $N$
asymptotic expansion for both the GUE and LUE --- two versions of the LUE are
considered, one with the parameter $a$ fixed, and the other with $a$
proportional to $N$. Both settings in the LUE case allow for an interpretation
in terms of the distribution of a particular weighted path length in a model
involving exponential variables on a rectangular grid, as the grid size gets
large. We give operator theoretic forms of the corrections, which are
corollaries of knowledge of the first two terms in the large $N$ expansion of
the scaled kernel, and are readily computed using a method due to Bornemann. We
also give expressions in terms of the solutions of particular systems of
coupled differential equations, which provide an alternative method of
computation. Both characterisations are well suited to a thinned generalisation

probability $(1 - \xi)$. In the final section, we investigate using simulation
the question of whether upon an appropriate centring and scaling a wider class

be realized in a cubic or tetrahedral crystal, while it is a candidate for the
interior $^3P_2$ superfluids of neutron stars. The cyclic state is an admixture
of full gap and nodal gap with eight Weyl points and the low-energy physics is
governed by itinerant Majorana fermions. We here show the evolution of surface
states from Majorana cone to Majorana arcs under rotation of surface
orientation. The Majorana cone is protected solely by an accidental spin
rotation symmetry and fragile against spin-orbit coupling, while the arcs are
attributed to two topological invariants: the first Chern number and
one-dimensional winding number. Lastly, we discuss how topologically protected
surface states inherent to the nonunitary cyclic pairing can be captured from
surface probes in candidate compounds, such as U$_{1-x}$Th$_{x}$Be$_{13}$. We
examine tunneling conductance spectra for two competitive scenarios in

  In this paper, we present Streak, a RDF data management system that is
designed to support a wide-range of queries with spatial filters including
complex joins, top-k, higher-order relationships over spatially enriched

identifier encoding strategy for spatial and non-spatial entities, the use of a

use of adaptive query processing with zero plan-switch cost. We show that
Streak can scale to some of the largest publicly available semantic data

optimizing over the data set of interest, by considering each data point as the
true location parameter and computing a data fit criterion. Subsequently, the
data point that minimizes the criterion is declared as the change point
estimate. For estimating multiple change points, the procedures are analogous
in spirit, but significantly more involved in execution. Since change-points
are local discontinuities, only data points close to the actual change point
provide useful information for estimation, while data points far away are
superfluous, to the point where using only a few points close to the true
parameter is just as precise as using the full data set. Leveraging this
""locality principle"", we introduce a two-stage procedure for the problem at
hand, which in the 1st stage uses a sparse subsample to obtain pilot estimates
of the underlying change points, and in the 2nd stage refines these estimates
by sampling densely in appropriately defined neighborhoods around them. We
establish that this method achieves the same rate of convergence and even
virtually the same asymptotic distribution as the analysis of the full data,
while reducing computational complexity to O(N^0.5) time (N being the length of
data set), as opposed to at least O(N) time for all current procedures, making
it promising for the analysis on exceedingly long data sets with adequately
spaced out change points. The main results are established under a signal plus
noise model with independent and identically distributed error terms, but
extensions to dependent data settings, as well as multiple stage (>2)
procedures are also provided. The performance of our procedure -- which is
coined ""intelligent sampling"" -- is illustrated on both synthetic and real

interpreting hazards may be difficult. Recently, there has been concern in the
causal inference literature that hazards actually have a built in
selection-effect that prevents simple causal interpretations. This is even a
problem in randomized controlled trials, where hazard ratios have become a
standard measure of treatment effects. Modeling on the hazard scale is
nevertheless convenient, e.g. to adjust for covariates. Using hazards for
intermediate calculations may therefore be desirable. Here, we provide a
generic method for transforming hazard estimates consistently to other scales
at which these built in selection effects are avoided. The method is based on
differential equations, and generalize a well known relation between the
Nelson-Aalen and Kaplan-Meier estimators. Using the martingale central limit
theorem we also find that covariances can be estimated consistently for a large
class of estimators, thus allowing for rapid calculations of confidence
intervals. Hence, given cumulative hazard estimates based on e.g. Aalen's
additive hazard model, we can obtain many other parameters without much more
effort. We present several examples and associated estimators. Coverage and

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During the early evolution of the post-merger remnant,
the state of the torus is determined by a combination of neutrino cooling and
magnetically-driven heating processes, so realistic models must include both
effects. In this paper, we study the post-merger evolution of a magnetized
black hole-neutron star binary system using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC)
from an initial post-merger state provided by previous numerical relativity
simulations. We use a finite-temperature nuclear equation of state and
incorporate neutrino effects in a leakage approximation. To achieve the needed
accuracy, we introduce improvements to SpEC's implementation of
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), including the use of
cubed-sphere multipatch grids and an improved method for dealing with
supersonic accretion flows where primitive variable recovery is difficult. We
find that a seed magnetic field triggers a sustained source of heating, but its
thermal effects are largely cancelled by the accretion and spreading of the
torus from MHD-related angular momentum transport. The neutrino luminosity
peaks at the start of the simulation, and then drops significantly over the
first 20\,ms but in roughly the same way for magnetized and nonmagnetized
disks. The heating rate and disk's luminosity decrease much more slowly
thereafter. These features of the evolution are insensitive to grid structure
and resolution, formulation of the MHD equations, and seed field strength,
although turbulent effects are not fully converged

such as performance bottlenecks, safety violations or security vulnerabilities
already during a software system's implementation. Yet, as current software
systems continue to grow, current static-analysis systems more frequently face
the problem of insufficient scalability. We argue that this is mainly due to
the fact that current static analyses are implemented fully manually, often in
general-purpose programming languages such as Java or C, or in declarative
languages such as Datalog. This design choice predefines the way in which the
static analysis evaluates, and limits the optimizations and extensions
static-analysis designers can apply.
  To boost scalability to a new level, we propose to fuse static-analysis with
just-in-time-optimization technology, introducing for the first time static
analyses that are managed and inherently self-adaptive. Those analyses
automatically adapt themselves to yield a performance/precision tradeoff that
is optimal with respect to the analyzed software system and to the analysis
itself.
  Self-adaptivity is enabled by the novel idea of designing a dedicated
intermediate representation, not for the analyzed program but for the analysis
itself. This representation allows for an automatic optimization and adaptation
of the analysis code, both ahead-of-time (through static analysis of the static
analysis) as well as just-in-time during the analysis' execution, similar to
just-in-time compilers.

abstraction for representing D-finite functions. They form the Ore ring
$K(x)[D_x]$, where $K$ is the constant field. Suppose $K$ is the quotient field
of some principal ideal domain $R$. The ring $R[x][D_x]$ consists of elements
in $K(x)[D_x]$ without ""denominator"".
  Given $L \in K(x)[D_x]$, it generates a left ideal $I$ in $K(x)[D_x]$. We
call $I \cap R[x][D_x]$ the univariate contraction of $I$.
  When $L$ is a linear ordinary differential or difference operator, we design
a contraction algorithm for $L$ by using desingularized operators as proposed
by Chen, Jaroschek, Kauers and Singer. When $L$ is an ordinary differential
operator and $R = K$, our algorithm is more elementary than known algorithms.
In other cases, our results are new.
  We propose the notion of completely desingularized operators, study their
properties, and design an algorithm for computing them. Completely
desingularized operators have interesting applications such as certifying
integer sequences and checking special cases of a conjecture of Krattenthaler.
  A D-finite system is a finite set of linear homogeneous partial differential
equations in several variables, whose solution space is of finite dimension.
For such systems, we give the notion of a singularity in terms of the
polynomials appearing in them. We show that a point is a singularity of the
system unless it admits a basis of power series solutions in which the starting
monomials are as small as possible with respect to some term order. Then a
singularity is apparent if the system admits a full basis of power series
solutions, the starting terms of which are not as small as possible. We prove
that apparent singularities in the multivariate case can be removed like in the
univariate case by adding suitable additional solutions to the original system.

interact with a bubble currently driven by the winds of the remaining B-stars
of UCL. We investigate if the Lupus I molecular could have formed in a
colliding flow, and how the kinematics of the cloud might have been influenced
by the larger scale gas dynamics. We performed APEX 13CO and C18O observations
of three parts of Lupus. We compare these results to the atomic hydrogen data
from the GASS HI survey and our dust emission results presented in the previous
paper. Based on the velocity information, we present a geometric model for the
interaction zone between the USco shell and the UCL wind bubble. We present
evidence that the molecular gas of Lupus I is tightly linked to the atomic
material of the USco shell. The CO emission in Lupus I is found mainly at
velocities in the same range as the HI velocities. Thus, the molecular cloud is
co-moving with the expanding USco atomic Hi shell. The gas in the cloud shows a
complex kinematic structure with several line-of-sight components that overlay
each other. The non-thermal velocity dispersion is in the transonic regime in
all parts of the cloud and could be injected by external compression. Our
observations and the derived geometric model agree with a scenario where Lupus
I is located in the interaction zone between the USco shell and the UCL wind
bubble. The kinematics observations are consistent with a scenario where the
Lupus I cloud formed via shell instabilities. The particular location of Lupus
I between USco and UCL suggests that counter-pressure from the UCL wind bubble
and pre-existing density enhancements, perhaps left over from the gas stream
that formed the stellar subgroups, may have played a role in its formation.

formal continuum limit assumes the emergence of a continuous space, but
ultimately continuous spaces should be obtained as preferred configurations of
the quantum CTM. In this paper we study the symmetry properties of a wave
function which exactly solves the quantum constraints of the CTM for general
$N$. We have found that it has strong peaks at configurations invariant under
some Lie-groups, as predicted by a mechanism described in our previous paper. A
surprising result was the preference of configurations invariant not only under
Lie-groups with positive signatures, but also with spacetime-like signatures,
i.e., $SO(1,n)$. Such symmetries could characterize the global structures of
spacetimes, and our results are encouraging towards showing spacetime emergence
in the CTM. To verify the asymptotic convergence of the wave function we have
also analyzed the asymptotic behaviour, which for the most part seems to be
well under control.

this we build a general formalism on the basis of perturbation theory that
applies to dilute assemblies but which goes beyond the point-dipole

in addition to their separation and spatial arrangement. The contribution to
the frequency shift due to the shape and size of the nano-elements has been
obtained in terms of their aspect ratio, their separation and the lattice
geometry. We have also varied the size of the array itself and compared the
results with a semi-analytical model and reached an agreement that improves as
the size of the array increases. We find that the red-shift of the
ferromagnetic resonance due to dipolar interactions decreases for smaller
arrays. Surface effects may induce either a blue-shift or a red-shift of the
FMR frequency, depending on the crystal and magnetic properties of the
nano-elements themselves. In particular, some configurations of the
nano-elements assemblies may lead to a full compensation between surface
effects and dipole interactions.

the criminal events or predicting violent emergencies. However, efficient
action recognition is not free of difficulty. First, there are so many action

beforehand. Moreover, it is very hard to collect real-word videos for certain
particular actions such as steal and street fight due to legal restrictions and
privacy protection. These challenges make existing data-driven recognition
methods insufficient to attain desired performance. Zero-shot learning is
potential to be applied to solve these issues since it can perform
classification without positive example. Nevertheless, current zero-shot
learning algorithms have been studied under the unreasonable setting where seen
classes are absent during the testing phase. Motivated by this, we study the
task of action recognition in surveillance video under a more realistic
\emph{generalized zero-shot setting}, where testing data contains both seen and
unseen classes. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to study video
action recognition under the generalized zero-shot setting. We firstly perform
extensive empirical studies on several existing zero-shot leaning approaches
under this new setting on a web-scale video data. Our experimental results
demonstrate that, under the generalize setting, typical zero-shot learning
methods are no longer effective for the dataset we applied. Then, we propose a
method for action recognition by deploying generalized zero-shot learning,
which transfers the knowledge of web video to detect the anomalous actions in
surveillance videos. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we
further construct a new surveillance video dataset consisting of nine action
classes related to the public safety situation.

controlled by the local material strength because of their low surface gravity,
and craters that are as large as the parent bodies should be affected by the
target curvature. Although cratering processes on planar surfaces in the
strength-controlled regime have been studied extensively, the mechanism by
which target curvature affects the cratering processes remains unclear. Herein,
we report on a series of impact experiments that used spherical targets with
various diameters. The resultant craters consisted of a deep circular pit and
an irregular-shaped spall region around the pit, which is consistent with the
features reported in a number of previous cratering experiments on planar
surfaces. However, the volume and radius of the craters increased with the
normalized curvature. The results indicate that the increase in the
spall-region volume and radius mainly contributes to the increase in the whole
crater volume and radius, although the volume, depth, and radius of pits remain
constant with curvature. The results of our model indicate that the geometric
effect due to curvature (i.e., whereby the distance from the equivalent center
to the target free surface is shorter for higher curvature values) contributes
to increases in the cratering efficiency. Our results suggest that the
impactors that produce the largest craters (basins) on some asteroids are thus
smaller than what is estimated by current scaling laws, which do not take into
account the curvature effects.

explosive charges shaped as an annular arc (rib). Steady detonation in a
straight charge propagates at constant speed but when it enters an annular
section, it goes through a transition phase and eventually reaches a new steady
state of constant angular velocity. This study examines the speed of the
detonation wave along the annular charge during the transition phase and at
steady state, as well as its dependence on the dimensions of the annulus. The
system is modeled using a recently proposed diffuse-interface formulation which
allows for the representation of a two-phase explosive and of an additional
inert material. The explosive considered is the polymer-bonded TATB-based LX-17
and is modeled using two JWL equations of state and the Ignition and Growth
reaction rate law. Results show that steady state speeds are in good agreement
with experiment. In the transition phase, the evolution of outer detonation
speed deviates from the exponential bounded growth function suggested by
previous studies. We propose a new description of the transition phase which
consists of two regimes. The first is caused by local effects at the outer edge
of the annulus and leads to a dependence of outer detonation speed on angular
position along the arc. The second regime is induced by effects originating
from the inner edge of the annular charge and leads to the deceleration of the
outer detonation until steady state is reached. The study concludes with a
parametric study where the dependence of the steady state and the transition
phase on the dimensions of the annulus is investigated.

It was discovered that the task can be characterized, both theoretically and
numerically, by solving a sequence of matrix nuclear-norm and $\ell_1$-norm
involved convex minimization problems. For solving this problem, the direct
extension of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in an usual
Gauss-Seidel manner often performs numerically well in practice but there is no
theoretical guarantee on its convergence. In this paper, we resolve this
dilemma by using the novel symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) based ADMM developed by
Li, Sun \& Toh (Math. Prog. 2016). The sGS-ADMM is guaranteed to converge and
we shall demonstrate in this paper that it is also practically efficient than
the directly extended ADMM. When the sGS technique is applied to this
particular problem, we show that only one variable needs to be re-updated, and
this updating hardly imposes any excessive computational cost. The sGS
decomposition theorem of Li, Sun \& Toh (arXiv: 1703.06629) establishes the
equivalent between sGS-ADMM and the classical ADMM with an additional
semi-proximal term, so the convergence result is followed directly. Extensive
experiments illustrate that the sGS-ADMM and its generalized variant have
superior numerical efficiency over the directly extended ADMM.

encounter between two halos of equal mass. NGC3447 and NGC3447A belong to the

gravitational instability, enhanced by the encounter, fuels a long lived

very high dynamic ranges, which challenges calibration and imaging systems.
Correct calibration of the instrument and accurate measurements of source flux
densities and polarisations require precise characterisation of the telescope's

(GLEAM) survey show that the previously implemented Average Embedded Element
(AEE) model still leaves residual polarisations errors of up to 10-20 % in
Stokes Q. We present a new simulation-based Full Embedded Element (FEE) model
which is the most rigorous realisation yet of the MWA's primary beam model. It
enables efficient calculation of the MWA beam response in arbitrary directions
without necessity of spatial interpolation. In the new model, every dipole in
the MWA tile (4 x 4 bow-tie dipoles) is simulated separately, taking into
account all mutual coupling, ground screen and soil effects, and therefore
accounts for the different properties of the individual dipoles within a tile.
We have applied the FEE beam model to GLEAM observations at 200 - 231 MHz and
used false Stokes parameter leakage as a metric to compare the models. We have
determined that the FEE model reduced the magnitude and declination-dependent
behaviour of false polarisation in Stokes Q and V while retaining low levels of
false polarisation in Stokes U.

it can cycle into the dense-phase. Consequently, one of the crucial questions
in reconciling star-formation in clouds is to understand the factors that
control this process. While it is widely accepted that the variation in ambient
conditions can alter significantly the ability of a cloud to spawn stars, the
observed variation in the star-formation rate in nearby clouds that experience
similar ambient conditions, presents an interesting question. In this work we
attempted to reconcile this variation within the paradigm of colliding flows.
To this end we develop self-gravitating, hydrodynamic realisations of identical
flows, but allowed to collide off-centre. Typical observational diagnostics
such as the gas-velocity dispersion, the fraction of dense-gas, the column
density distribution ({\small N-PDF}), the distribution of gas mass as a
function of $K$-band extinction and the strength of compressional/solenoidal
modes in the post-collision cloud were deduced for different choices of the
impact parameter of collision. We find that a strongly sheared cloud is
terribly inefficient in cycling gas into the dense phase and that such a cloud
can possibly reconcile the sluggish nature of star-formation reported for some
clouds. Within the paradigm of cloud-formation via colliding flows this is
possible in case of flows colliding with a relatively large impact parameter.
We conclude that compressional modes - though probably essential - are
insufficient to ensure a relatively higher star-formation efficiency in a
cloud.

challenges in predicting HDR values. To train the CNN we gather a large dataset
of HDR images, which we augment by simulating sensor saturation for a range of
cameras. To further boost robustness, we pre-train the CNN on a simulated HDR
dataset created from a subset of the MIT Places database. We demonstrate that
our approach can reconstruct high-resolution visually convincing HDR results in
a wide range of situations, and that it generalizes well to reconstruction of
images captured with arbitrary and low-end cameras that use unknown camera
response functions and post-processing. Furthermore, we compare to existing
methods for HDR expansion, and show high quality results also for image based
lighting. Finally, we evaluate the results in a subjective experiment performed

Recently, a strong Tc trend was reported in the Zetta Reticuli binary system

elements relative to its companion (${\zeta}$1 Ret). This depletion was
explained by the presence of a debris disk around ${\zeta}$2 Ret. Later,
Adibekyan et al. (2016b) confirmed the significance of the trend, however,
casted doubts on the interpretation proposed. Using three individual highest
quality spectra for each star, they found that the Tc trends depend on the
individual spectra (three spectra of each star were used) used in the
analaysis. In the current work we re-evaluated the presence and variability of
the Tc trend in this system using a larger number of individual spectra. In
total, 62 spectra of ${\zeta}$2 Ret and 31 spectra of ${\zeta}$1 Ret was used.

nonphysical factors can be at the root of the T c trends for the cases of

play a fundamental role in the co-evolution between supermassive black holes
and their host galaxies. Finding observational evidence of such feedback
mechanisms is of crucial importance and it requires a multi-wavelength approach
in order to compare winds at different scales and phases. In Tombesi et al.
(2015) we reported the detection of a powerful ultra-fast outflow (UFO) in the
Suzaku X-ray spectrum of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS F11119$+$3257.
The comparison with a galaxy-scale OH molecular outflow observed with Herschel
in the same source supported the energy-conserving scenario for AGN feedback.
The main objective of this work is to perform an independent check of the
Suzaku results using the higher sensitivity and wider X-ray continuum coverage
of NuSTAR. We clearly detect a highly ionized Fe K UFO in the 100ks NuSTAR
spectrum with parameters $N_H = (3.2\pm1.5)\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$,
log$\xi$$=$$4.0^{+1.2}_{-0.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm, and $v_{\text{out}} =
0.253^{+0.061}_{-0.118}$ c. The launching radius is likely at a distance of $r
\ge 16$ $r_s$ from the black hole. The mass outflow rate is in the range
$\dot{M}_{out}$$\simeq$0.5-2 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The UFO momentum rate and
power are $\dot{P}_{out} \simeq$0.5-2 $L_{AGN}/c$ and $\dot{E}_{out}
\simeq$7-27\% $L_{AGN}$, respectively. The UFO parameters are consistent
between the 2013 Suzaku and the 2015 NuSTAR observations. Only the column
density is found to be variable, possibly suggesting a clumpy wind. The
comparison with the energetics of molecular outflows estimated in infrared and
millimeter wavelengths support a connection between the nuclear and
galaxy-scale winds in luminous AGN.

studies, have yielded null results for disks around young planet-mass
companions and placed stringent dust mass upper limits, typically less than 0.1
M_earth, when assuming dust continuum is optically thin. Such low-mass gas/dust
content can lead to a disk lifetime estimate (from accretion rates) much
shorter than the age of the system. To alleviate this timescale discrepancy, we
suggest that disks around wide companions might be very compact and optically
thick, in order to sustain a few Myr of accretion yet have very weak
(sub)millimeter flux so as to still be elusive to ALMA. Our order-of-magnitude
estimate shows that compact optically-thick disks might be smaller than 1000
R_jup and only emit ~micro-Jy of flux in the (sub)millimeter, but their average
temperature can be higher than that of circumstellar disks. The high disk
temperature could impede satellite formation, but it also suggests that mid- to
far-infrared might be more favorable than radio wavelengths to characterize
disk properties. Finally, the compact disk size might imply that dynamical
encounters between the companion and the star, or any other scatterers in the
system, play a role in the formation of planetary-mass companions.

deterministic high-dimensional dynamical system of interacting coherent
structures, defined as eddies with enough internal dynamics to behave
relatively autonomously from any remaining incoherent part of the flow. The
guiding principle is that randomness is not a property, but a methodological
choice of what to ignore in the flow, and that a complete understanding of
turbulence, including the possibility of control, requires that it be kept to a
minimum. After briefly reviewing the underlying low-order statistics of flows
at moderate Reynolds numbers, the article examines what two-point statistics
imply for the decomposition of the flow into individual eddies. Intense eddies
are examined next, including their temporal evolution, and shown to satisfy
many of the properties required for coherence. In particular, it is shown that
coherent structures larger than the Corrsin scale are a natural consequence of
the shear. In wall-bounded turbulence, they can be classified into coherent
dispersive waves and transient bursts. The former are found in the viscous
layer near the wall and as very-large structures spanning the boundary layer
thickness. Although they are shear-driven, these waves have enough internal
structure to maintain a uniform advection velocity. Conversely, bursts exist at
all scales, are characteristic of the logarithmic layer, and interact almost
linearly with the shear. While the waves require a wall to determine their
length scale, the bursts are essentially independent from it. The article
concludes with a brief review of our present theoretical understanding of
turbulent structures, and with a list of open problems and future perspectives.

the outflows across cosmic time. While the maximum outflow velocity depends
strongly on ionization potential, the absorption-weighted mean velocity does
not. As such, the bulk of the high-ionization absorption traces the
low-ionization gas, with an additional blueshifted absorption tail extending to
at least $-2000$ km/s . We interpret this tail as arising from the stellar wind

supercoiling density, we show that the energy barrier is in the $k_{\rm B} T$

center and a major cause of degradation of SiC-based devices. Despite the
extensiveness of the literature regarding the characterization and modeling of
the defect, many fundamental questions persist. Among them we have the shaky
connection of the EPR data to the electrical measurements, the physical origin
of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller (pJT) effect, the reasoning for the observed
sub-lattice dependence of the paramagnetic states, and the severe
temperature-dependence of some hyperfine signals which cannot be accounted for
by a thermally-activated dynamic averaging between equivalent JT-distorted
structures. In this work we address these problems by means of semi-local and
hybrid density functional calculations. We start by inventorying a total of
four vacancy structures. Diamagnetic states have well defined low-energy
structures, whereas paramagnetic states display metastability. This rich
structural variety is traced back to the filling of electronic states which are
shaped by a crystal-field-dependent pJT effect. From calculated minimum energy
paths for defect rotation and transformation mechanisms, combined with the
calculated formation energies and electrical levels, we arrived at a
configuration-coordinate diagram of the defect. The diagram provides us with a
detailed first-principles picture of the defect when subject to optical and
thermal excitations. The calculated acceptor and donor transitions agree well
with Z$_{1/2}$ and EH$_{6/7}$ trap energies, respectively. From comparison of
calculated and measured $U$-values, and correlating the site-dependent
formation energies with the relative intensity of the DLTS peaks in as-grown
material, we assign Z$_{1}$ (EH$_{6}$) and Z$_{2}$ (EH$_{7}$) signals to
acceptor (donor) transitions of carbon vacancies located on the $h$ and $k$
sub-lattice sites, respectively.

Standard Model, is among the most important goals of top quark studies at the
Large Hadron Collider. Apart from the standard methods, numerous new
observables and reconstruction techniques are employed to improve the overall
precision and to provide different sensitivities to various systematic
uncertainties. Recently, the normalised inverse invariant mass distribution of
the $t\bar{t}$ system and the leading extra jet not coming from the top quark
decays has been proposed for the $pp \to t\bar{t}j$ production process, denoted
as ${\cal R}(m_t^{pole},\rho_s)$. In this paper, a thorough study of different
theoretical predictions for this observable, however, with top quark decays
included, is carried out. We focus on fixed order NLO QCD calculations for the
di-lepton top quark decay channel at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. First, the
impact on the extraction of $m_t$ is investigated and afterwards the associated
uncertainties are quantified. In one approach we include all interferences,
off-shell effects and non-resonant backgrounds. This is contrasted with a
different approach with top quark decays in the narrow width approximation. In
the latter case, two cases are employed: NLO QCD corrections to the $pp\to
t\bar{t}j$ production process with leading order decays and the more
sophisticated case with QCD corrections and jet radiation present also in top
quark decays. The top quark mass sensitivity of ${\cal R}(m_t^{pole},\rho_s)$
is investigated and compared to other observables: the invariant mass of the
top anti-top pair, the minimal invariant mass of the $b$-jet and a charged
lepton as well as the total transverse momentum of the $t\bar{t}j$ system.

  Computation)",,,,"cs.FL cs.LO math.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work studies which storage mechanisms in automata permit decidability of
the emptiness problem. The question is formalized using valence automata, an
abstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is given by a monoid.
For each of a variety of storage mechanisms, one can choose a (typically
infinite) monoid $M$ such that valence automata over $M$ are equivalent to
(one-way) automata with this type of storage. In fact, many important storage
mechanisms can be realized by monoids defined by finite graphs, called graph
monoids. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which
behave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative
values), and combinations thereof.
  Hence, we study for which graph monoids the emptiness problem for valence
automata is decidable. A particular model realized by graph monoids is that of
Petri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing
open question and we do not answer it here.
  However, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a
characterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those
storage mechanisms for which decidability remains open. This leads to a model
that naturally generalizes both pushdown Petri nets and the priority
multicounter machines introduced by Reinhardt.
  The cases that are proven decidable constitute a natural and apparently new
extension of Petri nets with decidable reachability. It is finally shown that
this model can be combined with another such extension by Atig and Ganty: We
present a further decidability result that subsumes both of these Petri net
extensions.

increase the density of random point defects, while the embedding mainly
reduces the density of twin boundaries. Pristine and irradiated crystals
present two outstanding features in the temperature dependence of the flux
creep rate: S(T) presents large values at low temperatures, which can be
attributed to small pinning energies, and a plateau at intermediate

for our understanding of internal hadron structure and QCD, the dynamics that
bind the quarks in hadrons. The pion electromagnetic form factor has been
measured at small space-like momentum transfer $|q^2| < 0.3$~GeV$^2$ by pion
scattering from atomic electrons and at values up to $2.5$~GeV$^2$ by
scattering electrons from the pion cloud around a proton. On the other hand, in
the limit of very large (or infinite) $Q^2=-q^2$, perturbation theory is
applicable. This leaves a gap in the intermediate $Q^2$ where the form factors
are not known.
  As a part of their 12 GeV upgrade Jefferson Lab will measure pion and kaon
form factors in this intermediate region, up to $Q^2$ of $6$~GeV$^2$. This is
then an ideal opportunity for lattice QCD to make an accurate prediction ahead
of the experimental results. Lattice QCD provides a from-first-principles
approach to calculate form factors, and the challenge here is to control the
statistical and systematic uncertainties as errors grow when going to higher
$Q^2$ values.
  Here we report on a calculation that tests the method using an $\eta_s$
meson, a 'heavy pion' made of strange quarks, and also present preliminary
results for kaon and pion form factors. We use the $n_f=2+1+1$ ensembles made
by the MILC collaboration and Highly Improved Staggered Quarks, which allows us
to obtain high statistics. The HISQ action is also designed to have small
discretisation errors. Using several light quark masses and lattice spacings
allows us to control the chiral and continuum extrapolation and keep systematic

radial profiles for three spectroscopically-measured parameters that are
sensitive to the recent SFH: D$_n$(4000) (the 4000\AA\ break), EW(H$\delta_A$)
(equivalent width of the H$\delta$ absorption line), and EW(H$\alpha$)
(equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ emission line). We find the majority of the
spaxels in these galaxies are consistent with models with continuously
declining star formation rate, indicating that starbursts occur rarely in local
galaxies. We classify the galaxies into three classes: fully star-forming (SF),
partly quenched (PQ) and totally quenched (TQ), according to the fraction of
quenched area within 1.5 times the effective radius, $f_Q(1.5R_e)$. We find
that galaxies less massive than $10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ present at most weak
radial gradients in all the diagnostic parameters. In contrast, galaxies with
stellar mass above $10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ present significant gradients in all
the three diagnostic parameters if classified as SF or PQ, but show weak
gradients in D$_n$(4000) and EW(H$\delta_A$) and no gradients in EW(H$\alpha$)
if in the TQ class. This implies the existence of a critical stellar mass, at
$\sim10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$, above which the star formation in a galaxy gets
shutdown from the inside out. Galaxies tend to evolve synchronously from inner
to outer regions before their mass reaches the critical value. We have further
divided the sample at fixed mass by both bulge-to-total luminosity ratio and
morphological type, finding that our conclusions hold regardless of these
factors: it appears that the presence of a central dense object is not a
driving parameter, but rather a byproduct of the star formation cessation
process.

dynamics that occur when a sharp edge is placed in the hydrodynamic nearfield
of an isothermal turbulent jet. We perform hydrodynamic and acoustic pressure
measurements in order to characterise the tones as a function of Mach number
and streamwise edge position. The distribution of spectral peaks observed, as a
function of Mach number, cannot be explained using the usual edge-tone
scenario, in which resonance is underpinned by coupling between
downstream-travelling Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepackets and upstream-travelling
sound waves. We show, rather, that the strongest tones are due to coupling
between the former and upstream-travelling jet modes recently studied by Towne
et al. (2017) and Schmidt et al. (2017). We also study the band-limited nature
of the resonance, showing a high-frequency cut-off to be due to the frequency
dependence of the upstream-travelling waves. At high Mach number these become
evanescent above a certain frequency, whereas at low Mach number they become
progressively trapped with increasing frequency, a consequence of which is
their not being reflected in the nozzle plane. Additionally, a weaker,
low-frequency, forced-resonance regime is identified that involves the same
upstream travelling jet modes but that couple, in this instance, with
downstream-travelling sound waves. It is suggested that the existence of two
resonance regimes may be due to the non-modal nature of wavepacket dynamics at
low-frequency.

irradiation from it and (ii) it could play a crucial role to produce an ejecta
component of appreciable mass with fast motion in the post-merger phase. We
also point out that (I) the neutron-star equation of state has to be
sufficiently stiff (i.e., the maximum mass of cold spherical neutron stars,
M_max, has to be appreciably higher than 2M_sun in order that a long-lived
massive neutron star can be formed as the merger remnant for the binary systems

to the nucleation of ultra-nano crystalline seeds, embedded in an amorphous

Two mobile agents with different labels, starting at different nodes of an
anonymous graph, have to meet. This task has been considered in the literature
under two alternative scenarios: weak and strong. Under the weak scenario,
agents may meet either at a node or inside an edge. Under the strong scenario,
they have to meet at a node, and they do not even notice meetings inside an
edge. Rendezvous algorithms under the strong scenario are known for synchronous
agents. For asynchronous agents, rendezvous under the strong scenario is
impossible even in the two-node graph, and hence only algorithms under the weak
scenario were constructed. In this paper we show that rendezvous under the
strong scenario is possible for agents with restricted asynchrony: agents have
the same measure of time but the adversary can arbitrarily impose the speed of
traversing each edge by each of the agents. We construct a deterministic
rendezvous algorithm for such agents, working in time polynomial in the size of
the graph, in the length of the smaller label, and in the largest edge
traversal time.

informational needs using the signal processing metrics of entropy, noise,

define the trust humans experience as a primitive statistical algorithm

This definition of neuromechanical trust implies that artificial sensorimotor

representation of its world over the long term by violating the implicit
statistical contract for which self-calibration evolved. This approach allows
us to model addiction in general as the result of homeostatic regulation gone

decalibration caused by digital sensorimotor data spurs yet more consumption of
them. We predict that institutions can use these sensorimotor metrics to

and optimization of stochastic systems. The parameters of stochastic behavior
of MDPs are estimates from empirical observations of a system; their values are
not known precisely. Different types of MDPs with uncertain, imprecise or
bounded transition rates or probabilities and rewards exist in the literature.
  Commonly, analysis of models with uncertainties amounts to searching for the
most robust policy which means that the goal is to generate a policy with the
greatest lower bound on performance (or, symmetrically, the lowest upper bound
on costs). However, hedging against an unlikely worst case may lead to losses
in other situations. In general, one is interested in policies that behave well
in all situations which results in a multi-objective view on decision making.
  In this paper, we consider policies for the expected discounted reward
measure of MDPs with uncertain parameters. In particular, the approach is
defined for bounded-parameter MDPs (BMDPs) [8]. In this setting the worst, best
and average case performances of a policy are analyzed simultaneously, which
yields a multi-scenario multi-objective optimization problem. The paper
presents and evaluates approaches to compute the pure Pareto optimal policies

explain atomic spectra in magnetic fields. Today intrinsic quantum mechanics
seems to be able to connect the strong and electroweak interaction sectors of
particle physics. Local gauge invariance in laboratory space corresponds to
left-invariance in intrinsic configuration space. We derive the proton spin
structure function and the proton magnetic moment as novel results of the

describes systems by means of ensembles of classical particles provided with a
sign. This novel approach mainly consists of two steps: the computation of the
Wigner kernel, a multi-dimensional function describing the effects of the
potential over the system, and the field-less evolution of the particles which
eventually create new signed particles in the process. Although this method has
proved to be extremely advantageous in terms of computational resources - as a
matter of fact it is able to simulate in a time-dependent fashion many- body
systems on relatively small machines - the Wigner kernel can represent the
bottleneck of simulations of certain systems. Moreover, storing the kernel can
be another issue as the amount of memory needed is cursed by the dimensionality
of the system. In this work, we introduce a new technique which drastically
reduces the computation time and memory requirement to simulate time-dependent
quantum systems which is based on the use of an appropriately tailored neural
network combined with the signed particle formalism. In particular, the
suggested neural network is able to compute efficiently and reliably the Wigner
kernel without any training as its entire set of weights and biases is
specified by analytical formulas. As a consequence, the amount of memory for
quantum simulations radically drops since the kernel does not need to be stored
anymore as it is now computed by the neural network itself, only on the cells
of the (discretized) phase-space which are occupied by particles. As its is
clearly shown in the final part of this paper, not only this novel approach
drastically reduces the computational time, it also remains accurate. The
author believes this work opens the way towards effective design of quantum
devices, with incredible practical implications.

synergy principle was developed in this study using probabilistic techniques,
which is applicable to incompressible flows with constant properties in both
laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The formula contains three categories of
non-dimensional indicators corresponding to the three criteria of the field
synergy principle respectively, including domain-averaged cosine of synergy
angle, the Pearson linear correlation coefficients between the scalar functions
contained in the energy governing equation of convective heat transfer, and the
variation coefficients of these functions. The physical meanings of these
