of operations in a parallel computing model. In this paper, we propose parallel
combining, a technique that implements a concurrent data structure from a
parallel batched one. The idea is that we explicitly synchronize concurrent
operations into batches: one of the processes becomes a combiner which collects
concurrent requests and initiates a parallel batched algorithm involving the
owners (clients) of the collected requests. Intuitively, the cost of
synchronizing the concurrent calls can be compensated by running the parallel
batched algorithm.
  We validate the intuition via two applications of parallel combining. First,
we use our technique to design a concurrent data structure optimized for
read-dominated workloads, taking a dynamic graph data structure as an example.
Second, we use a novel parallel batched priority queue to build a concurrent
one. In both cases, we obtain performance gains with respect to the
state-of-the-art algorithms.

this method is that these aggregated typical periods are modeled independently

high share of renewable generation.
  To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel mathematical description
for storage inventories based on the superposition of inter-period and

able to account their sequence. The approach has been adopted for different

sidebands. Here we consider MgO and LiF, and determine their nonadiabatic
Migdal self energy. The spectral function obtained from the Dyson equation
makes errors in the weight and energy of the QP peak and the position and
weight of the phonon-induced sidebands. Only one phonon satellite appears, with
an unphysically large energy difference (larger than the highest phonon energy)
with respect to the QP peak. By contrast, the spectral function from a cumulant
treatment of the same self energy is physically better, giving a quite accurate
QP energy and several satellites approximately spaced by the LO phonon energy.

Interestingly, for larger fields $H_*^\text{AFM} < H < H_{**}^\text{AFM}$, an
intermediate gapless phase is observed, before a second transition to the

actuator dynamics governed by general, quasilinear, first-order hyperbolic
PDEs. Since for such PDE-ODE cascades the speed of propagation depends on the
PDE state itself (which implies that the prediction horizon cannot be a priori
known analytically), the key design challenge is the determination of the
predictor state. We resolve this challenge and introduce a PDE
predictor-feedback control law that compensates the transport actuator
dynamics. Due to the potential formation of shock waves in the solutions of
quasilinear, first-order hyperbolic PDEs (which is related to the fundamental
restriction for systems with time-varying delays that the delay rate is bounded
by unity), we limit ourselves to a certain feasibility region around the origin
and we show that the PDE predictor-feedback law achieves asymptotic stability
of the closed-loop system, providing an estimate of its region of attraction.
Our analysis combines Lyapunov-like arguments and ISS estimates. Since it may
be intriguing as to what is the exact relation of the cascade to a system with
input delay, we highlight the fact that the considered PDE-ODE cascade gives
rise to a system with input delay, with a delay that depends on past input
values (defined implicitly via a nonlinear equation).

four different renormalization schemes, where parameters that are not directly

are presented for the corrections to partial decay widths for various benchmark

dependence on the MSbar renormalization scale and on the choice of the
renormalization scheme in detail. We find that it is crucial to be precise with
these issues in parameter analyses, since parameter conversions between
different schemes can involve sizeable or large corrections, especially in
scenarios that are close to experimental exclusion limits or theoretical
bounds. It even turns out that some renormalization schemes are not applicable
in specific regions of parameter space. Our investigation of differential
distributions shows that corrections beyond the Standard Model are mostly
constant offsets induced by the mixing between the light and heavy CP-even
Higgs bosons, so that differential analyses of h -> 4f decay observables do not
help to identify Two-Higgs-Doublet Models. Moreover, the decay widths do not

spatio-temporal polynomial reconstruction of the data in each spacetime cell,
at each time step. This reconstruction is obtained as the root of a nonlinear
system, resulting from the use of a Galerkin method. It was proved in Jackson
[7] that for traditional choices of basis polynomials, the eigenvalues of
certain matrices appearing in these nonlinear systems are always 0, regardless
of the number of spatial dimensions of the PDEs or the chosen order of accuracy
of the ADER-FV method. This guarantees fast convergence to the Galerkin root
for certain classes of PDEs.

If the density is about 10^7~cm^{-3} or higher, the latter diagram reproduces
the temperature fairly well. If the density is around 10^6~cm^{-3}, the
temperature obtained from the latter diagram should be multiplied by a factor
of 1.5--2. If the density is about 10^5~cm^{-3} or lower, then the latter
diagram yields a temperature that is lower than the kinetic temperature by a
factor of three or larger and should be used only as a lower limit on the
kinetic temperature. Errors of methanol column density determined from the
integrated intensity of a single line may be larger than an order of magnitude
even when the gas temperature is well-known. However, if the J_0-(J-1)_0E
lines, as well as the J_1-(J-1)_1A^{+} or A^{-} lines are used, the relative
error of the column density proves to be no larger than several units.

social domains. In reviewing this decade of research, we discuss recent
advancements in applied studies of complex contagions, particularly in the
domains of health, innovation diffusion, social media, and politics. We also
discuss how these empirical studies have spurred complementary advancements in
the theoretical modeling of contagions, which concern the effects of network
topology on diffusion, as well as the effects of individual-level attributes
and thresholds. In synthesizing these developments, we suggest three main
directions for future research. The first concerns the study of how multiple
contagions interact within the same network and across networks, in what may be
called an ecology of contagions. The second concerns the study of how the
structure of thresholds and their behavioral consequences can vary by
individual and social context. The third area concerns the roles of diversity
and homophily in the dynamics of complex contagion, including both diversity of
demographic profiles among local peers, and the broader notion of structural
diversity within a network. Throughout this discussion, we make an effort to
highlight the theoretical and empirical opportunities that lie ahead.

particles, the EFT framework emerges as the natural approach for the analysis

(so far) all the measured interactions look pretty much SM-like does not imply
that the linear Higgs representation as a complex doublet $\phi$ in the SMEFT
is always appropriate. Although there is a wide class of SM extensions that
accept this linear description, this realization does not always provide a good
perturbative expansion. The HEFT and its organization according to a chiral
expansion cures these issues. Path integral functional methods allow one to
compute the corrections to the NLO effective action: at tree level, the heavy
resonances only contribute to the $O(p^4)$ low-energy couplings (or higher)
according to a pattern that depends on their quantum numbers and is suppressed
by their masses; at the one-loop level, all the new-physics corrections go to
the $O(p^4)$ effective action (or higher) and are suppressed by an intrinsic
scale of the LO HEFT Lagrangian, which has been related in recent times with
the curvature of the manifold of scalar fields (being the SM its flat limit and
having the HEFT effective action an expansion in the curvature). This two
suppression scales (resonance masses and non-linearity/curvature) compete at
NLO and may, in principle, be very different/similar depending on the
particular BSM scenario and the observable at hand. Likewise, experiments do
not tell us yet whether $O(p^4)$ loops are essentially negligible or not, as it
is shown with a couple of examples. In summary, the HEFT extends the range of
applicability of the SMEFT, which, although justified for a pretty wide class
of BSM scenarios, introduces a bias in the data analyses and does not provide
the most general EFT framework.

However, this requires knowledge of the numerical value of all the channel

allocation where all the b channels each user gets are among his M-best. This
leads to feedback of significantly less than one bit per user per channel. For
a large class of fading distributions, including Rayleigh, Rician, m-Nakagami

associated arithmetic cross-section is parametrized by the attractor. This
construction allows us to represent the geodesic flow as a special flow over a
symbolic system of coding sequences. In special cases where the ""cycle ends""

in order to embed them in a real-valued vector space. Through extensive
experiments, we investigate the properties of the representations learned and
their efficacy in preserving information about link structure among users. We
also evaluate the representations in two different prediction tasks, namely,
predicting most likely future adopters of a topic and predicting the
geo-location of users. Experiments to validate the proposed methods are
performed on a large-scale social network extracted from Twitter, consisting of
about 7.7 million users and their activity on around 3.6 million topics over a

interactions with radiation, and through indirect interactions with clouds and
ecosystems. But the magnitudes of these effects are so uncertain that it
remains unclear whether atmospheric dust has a net warming or cooling effect on
global climate. Consequently, it is still uncertain whether large changes in
atmospheric dust loading over the past century have slowed or accelerated
anthropogenic climate change, or what the effects of potential future changes
in dust loading will be. Here we present an analysis of the size and abundance
of dust aerosols to constrain the direct radiative effect of dust. Using
observational data on dust abundance, in situ measurements of dust optical
properties and size distribution, and climate and atmospheric chemical
transport model simulations of dust lifetime, we find that the dust found in
the atmosphere is substantially coarser than represented in current global
climate models. Since coarse dust warms climate, the global dust direct
radiative effect is likely to be less cooling than the ~-0.4 W/m2 estimated by
models in a current global aerosol model ensemble. Instead, we constrain the
dust direct radiative effect to a range between -0.48 and +0.20 W/m2, which
includes the possibility that dust causes a net warming of the planet.

terminology and simplicity of the classic calculation but explicitly accounts
for the presence of the optically thick ""Lyman-limit systems"" that are known to

of this equation provides a better characterization of the timing of
reionization by smoothly linking the pre-overlap with the post-overlap phases

new insights on the sources of cosmic reionization using the improved

and Praesepe clusters have revealed a ubiquitous correlation between mass and
rotation, such that late M dwarfs rotate an order-of-magnitude faster than
early M dwarfs. In this paper, we demonstrate that this mass-rotation
correlation is present in the 10 Myr Upper Scorpius association, as revealed by
new ${\it K2}$ rotation measurements. Using rotational evolution models we show
that the low-mass ($0.1-0.6 M_{\odot}$) rotation distribution of the 125 Myr
Pleiades cluster can only be produced if it hosted an equally strong
mass-rotation correlation at 10 Myr. This suggests that physical processes
important in the early pre-main sequence (star formation, accretion,
disk-locking) are primarily responsible for the M dwarf rotation morphology,
and not quirks of later angular momentum evolution. Such early mass trends must
be taken into account when constructing initial conditions for future studies
of stellar rotation. Finally, we show that the average M star loses $\sim
25-40$% of its angular momentum between 10 and 125 Myr, a figure accurately and
generically predicted by modern solar-calibrated wind models. Their success
rules out a lossless pre-main sequence, and validates the extrapolation of
magnetic wind laws designed for solar-type stars to the low-mass regime at
early times.

simulations. Does the lopsided distribution of satellite systems around host
galaxy pairs constitute a similar challenge to the standard model of cosmology?
We investigate whether such satellite distributions are present around stacked
pairs of hosts extracted from the $\Lambda$CDM simulations Millennium-I,
Millennium-II, ELVIS, and Illustris-1. By utilizing this set of simulations
covering different volumes, resolutions, and physics, we implicitly test
whether a lopsided signal exists for different ranges of satellite galaxy

significantly different results. All simulations display a lopsidedness similar
to the observed situation. The signal is highly significant for simulations
containing a sufficient number of hosts and resolved satellite galaxies (up to
$5\,\sigma$ for Millennium-II). We find a projected signal that is up to twice
as strong as that reported for the SDSS systems for certain opening angles
($\sim16\%$ more satellites in the direction between the pair than expected for
uniform distributions). Considering that the SDSS signal is a lower limit owing
to likely back- and foreground contamination, the $\Lambda$CDM simulations
appear to be consistent with this particular empirical property of galaxy
pairs.

intertwined evolution and that active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a significant
impact on galaxy evolution. Since the large-scale environment can also affect
AGN, this work studies how their formation and properties depend on the
environment. We have used a reconstructed three-dimensional high-resolution
density field obtained from a Bayesian large-scale structure reconstruction
method applied to the 2M++ galaxy sample. A web-type classification relying on
the shear tensor is used to identify different structures on the cosmic web,
defining voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters. We confirm that the
environmental density affects the AGN formation and their properties. We found
that the AGN abundance is equivalent to the galaxy abundance, indicating that
active and inactive galaxies reside in similar dark matter halos. However,
occurrence rates are different for each spectral type and accretion rate. These
differences are consistent with the AGN evolutionary sequence suggested by
previous authors, Seyferts and Transition objects transforming into LINERs
(Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission Line Regions), the weaker counterpart of
Seyferts. We conclud that AGN properties depend on the environmental density
more than on the web-type. More powerful starbursts and younger stellar
populations are found in high densities, where interactions and mergers are
more likely. AGN hosts show smaller masses in clusters for Seyferts and
Transition objects, which might be due to gas stripping. In voids, the AGN
population is dominated by the most massive galaxy hosts.

hot Jupiters despite its very high irradiation. On the other hand, our fits for
HD 149026b prefer a very high albedo and an unusually high recirculation
efficiency. We also compare our results to predictions from general circulation
models, and find that while neither are a good match to the data, the
discrepancies for HD 149026b are especially large. We speculate that this may
be related to its high bulk metallicity, which could lead to enhanced
atmospheric opacities and the formation of reflective cloud layers in localized
regions of the atmosphere. We then place these two planets in a broader context
by exploring relationships between the temperatures, albedos, heat transport
efficiencies, and phase offsets of all planets with published thermal phase
curves. We find a striking relationship between phase offset and irradiation
temperature--the former drops with increasing temperature until around 3400 K,
and rises thereafter. Although some aspects of this trend are mirrored in the
circulation models, there are notable differences that provide important clues
for future modeling efforts.

the physics of electron irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number
shocks, for a representative case with sonic Mach number of 3 and plasma beta
of 16. We find that two basic ingredients are needed for electron entropy
production: (i) an electron temperature anisotropy, induced by field
amplification coupled to adiabatic invariance; and (ii) a mechanism to break
the electron adiabatic invariance itself. In shocks, field amplification occurs
at two major sites: at the shock ramp, where density compression leads to an
increase of the frozen-in field; and farther downstream, where the shock-driven
proton temperature anisotropy generates strong proton cyclotron and mirror
modes. The electron temperature anisotropy induced by field amplification
exceeds the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of
whistler waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for
efficient entropy production. We find that the electron heating efficiency
displays only a weak dependence on mass ratio (less than 30 percent drop, as we

LHC. We find that with $140\, \mathrm{GeV} < m_{H^+} < 160\, \mathrm{GeV}$,
$\tan \beta \sim 5$ and a coupling to gauge bosons of $\sin^2 \delta \sim 0.1$,
such a scenario can produce all the excesses simultanously, where $tth$ arise
from contamination from the rare top decays, as previously proposed. An
implication of the Type-I scenario is that any $\gamma \gamma$ excess should be
associated with additional elements that could reduce background, including
$b$-jets, forward jets or signs of vector boson production.

essential for understanding their emergent properties, but has remained
enigmatic due to a lack of appropriate experimental probes. Here by employing a

Very Large Array (VLA) 3 GHz observations in the COSMOS field, we investigate
the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) for
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) we classify as either spheroid- or disc-dominated
based on their morphology. The sample predominantly consists of disc galaxies
with stellar mass ${\gtrsim}10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$, and residing on the
star-forming main sequence (MS). After the removal of AGN using standard
approaches, we observe a significant difference between the redshift-evolution
of the median IR/radio ratio $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ of (i) a sample of
ellipticals, plus discs with a substantial bulge component
(`spheroid-dominated' SFGs) and, (ii) virtually pure discs and irregular
systems (`disc-dominated' SFGs). The spheroid-dominated population follows a
declining $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ vs. $z$ trend similar to that measured
in recent evolutionary studies of the IRRC. However, for disc-dominated
galaxies, where radio and IR emission should be linked to star formation in the
most straightforward way, we measure very little change in
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$. This suggests that low-redshift calibrations of
radio emission as an SFR-tracer may remain valid out to at least
$z\,{\simeq}\,1\,{-}\,1.5$ for pure star-forming systems. We find that the
different redshift-evolution of $q_{\rm TIR}$ for the spheroid- and
disc-dominated sample is mainly due to an increasing radio excess for
spheroid-dominated galaxies at $z\,{\gtrsim}\,$0.8, hinting at some residual
AGN activity in these systems. This finding demonstrates that in the absence of
AGN the IRRC is independent of redshift, and that radio observations can
therefore be used to estimate SFRs at all redshifts for genuinely star-forming
galaxies.

fractional Laplacian of order $z = 1 + 2\zeta$, such that the interfaces
spontaneously relax, with a dynamical exponent $z$, to a self-affine geometry
with roughness exponent $\zeta$. By continuously increasing from $\zeta=-1/2$
(macroscopically flat interface described by independent Ornstein--Uhlenbeck
processes) to $\zeta=3/2$ (super-rough Mullins--Herring interface), three
different regimes are identified: (I) $-1/2<\zeta<0$, (II) $0<\zeta<1$, and
(III) $1<\zeta<3/2$. Starting from a flat initial condition, the mean number of
zeros of the discretized interface (I) decays exponentially in time and reaches
an extensive value in the system size, or decays as a power-law towards (II) a
sub-extensive or (III) an intensive value. In the steady-state, the
distribution of intervals between zeros changes from an exponential decay in
(I) to a power-law decay $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-\gamma}$ in (II) and (III). While
in (II) $\gamma=1-\theta$ with $\theta=1-\zeta$ the steady-state persistence
exponent, in (III) we obtain $\gamma = 3-2\zeta$, different from the exponent
$\gamma=1$ expected from the prediction $\theta=0$ for infinite super-rough
interfaces with $\zeta>1$. The effect on $P(\ell)$ of short-scale smoothening
is also analyzed numerically and analytically. A tight relation between the
mean interval, the mean width of the interface and the density of zeros is also
reported. The results drawn from our analysis of rough interfaces subject to
particular boundary conditions or constraints, along with discretization

correlation between two time series across time. Although used primarily in
finance so far, DCC has been proposed recently as a model-based estimation
method for quantifying functional connectivity during fMRI experiments. DCC
could also be used to estimate the dynamic correlation between other types of
time series such as local field potentials (LFP's) or spike trains recorded
from distinct brain areas. DCC has very nice properties compared to other
existing methods, but its applications for neuroscience are currently limited
because of non-optimal performance in the presence of outliers. To address this
issue, we developed a robust nonparametric version of DCC, based on an
adaptation of the weighted visibility graph algorithm which converts a time
series into a weighted graph. The modified DCC demonstrated better performance
in the analysis of empirical data sets: one fMRI data set collected from a
human subject performing a Stroop task; and one LFP data set recorded from an
awake rat in resting state. Nonparametric DCC has the potential of enlarging
the spectrum of analytical tools designed to assess the dynamic coupling and

collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider energy $\sqrt {s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV
are investigated within the integrated hydrokinetic model (iHKM). Photon
production is accumulated from the different processes at the various stages of
relativistic heavy ion collisions: from the primary hard photons of very early
stage of parton collisions to the thermal photons from equilibrated quark-gluon
and hadron gas stages. Along the way a hadronic medium evolution is treated in
two distinct, in a sense opposite, approaches: chemically equilibrated and
chemically frozen system expansion. Studying the centrality dependence of the
results obtained allows us to conclude that a relatively strong transverse
momentum anisotropy of thermal radiation is suppressed by prompt photon
emission which is an isotropic. We find out that this effect is getting
stronger as centrality increases because of the simultaneous increase in the
relative contribution of prompt photons in the soft part of the spectra. The
substantial results obtained in iHKM with nonzero viscosity ($\eta/s=0.08$) for
photon spectra and $v_2$ coefficients are mostly within the error bars of
experimental data, but there is some systematic underestimation of both
observables for the near central events. We claim that a situation could be
significantly improved if an additional photon radiation that accompanies the
presence of a deconfined environment is included. Since a matter of a
space-time layer where hadronization takes place is actively involved in
anisotropic transverse flow, both positive contributions to the spectra and
$v_2$ are considerable, albeit such an argument needs further research and
elaboration.

in the fluid layer are in the form of magnetic-Coriolis waves, which are
restored by both the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force. Energy dissipation
occurs through viscous damping and Ohmic damping of these waves. Our numerical
results show that the tidal dissipation can be dominated by Ohmic damping even
with a weak magnetic field. The presence of a magnetic field smooths out the
complicated frequency-dependence of the dissipation rate, and broadens the
frequency spectrum of the dissipation rate, depending on the strength of the
background magnetic field. However, the frequency-averaged dissipation is
independent of the strength and structure of the magnetic field, and of the
dissipative parameters, in the approximation that the wave-like response is
driven only by the Coriolis force acting on the non-wavelike tidal flow.
Indeed, the frequency-averaged dissipation quantity is in good agreement with
previous analytical results in the absence of magnetic fields. Our results
suggest that the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation of the wavelike
perturbations is insensitive to detailed damping mechanisms and dissipative
properties.

mostly late-type disk, main-sequence star-forming galaxies with 10^8.5 -

two-dimensional maps of the stellar and gas kinematics, including the radial
velocity V and velocity dispersion sigma. We find that most galaxies in the
sample are consistent with having rotating stellar disks with roughly constant
velocity dispersions and that the Vrms=sqrt{V^2+sigma^2} of the gas and stars,
a scaling proxy for the galaxy gravitational potential, compare well to each
other. These spatially resolved observations of intermediate redshift galaxies
suggest that the regular stellar kinematics of disk galaxies that is observed
in the local Universe was already in place 4 - 7 Gyr ago and that their gas
kinematics traces the gravitational potential of the galaxy, thus is not
dominated by shocks and turbulent motions. Finally, we build dynamical
axisymmetric Jeans models constrained by the derived stellar kinematics for two
specific galaxies and derive their dynamical masses. These are in good
agreement (within 25%) with those derived from simple exponential disk models
based on the gas kinematics. The obtained mass-to-light ratios hint towards
dark matter dominated systems within a few effective radii.

benchmarked using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), given a fixed geometry of
anchor nodes and a target. However, by endowing the target and anchor locations
with distributions, this paper recasts this traditional, scalar benchmark as a
random variable. The goal of this work is to derive an analytical expression
for the distribution of this now random CRLB, in the context of
Time-of-Arrival-based positioning.
  To derive this distribution, this work first analyzes how the CRLB is
affected by the order statistics of the angles between consecutive
participating anchors (i.e., internodal angles). This analysis reveals an
intimate connection between the second largest internodal angle and the CRLB,
which leads to an accurate approximation of the CRLB. Using this approximation,
a closed-form expression for the distribution of the CRLB, conditioned on the
number of participating anchors, is obtained.
  Next, this conditioning is eliminated to derive an analytical expression for
the marginal CRLB distribution. Since this marginal distribution accounts for
all target and anchor positions, across all numbers of participating anchors,
it therefore statistically characterizes localization error throughout an
entire wireless network. This paper concludes with a comprehensive analysis of
this new network-wide-CRLB paradigm.

result of the inefficiency of the nonlinear dynamo. This result is in a good
agreement with existing numerical simulations and well explains the X-ray spots

experimental and numerical investigations identify an instability of stripe
domains in the long direction as a means of nucleating isolated magnetic
skyrmions. Here, the onset and nonlinear evolution of transverse instabilities
for a dynamic stripe domain known as the bion stripe are investigated. Both
non-topological and topological variants of the bion stripe are shown to
exhibit a long-wavelength transverse instability with different characteristic
features. In the former, small transverse variations in the stripe's width lead
to a neck instability that eventually pinches the non-topological stripe into a
chain of two-dimensional breathers composed of droplet soliton pairs. In the
latter case, small variations in the stripe's center results in a snake
instability whose topological structure leads to the nucleation of dynamic
magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions as well as perimeter-modulated droplets.
Quantitative, analytical predictions for both the early, linear evolution and
the long-time, nonlinear evolution are achieved using an averaged Lagrangian
approach that incorporates both exchange (dispersion) and anisotropy
(nonlinearity). The method of analysis is general and can be applied to other

explains Mandelbrot's refinement as no more than a fudge factor, accommodating
the effects of the exclusion of the rank-frequency dark matter. Thus,
integrating these non-word objects resolves a more-generalized rank-frequency

our results to finite sequences.
  First we define the annihilator ideal $I_F$ of a non-zero form $F\in
K[x^{-1},z^{-1}]$, a homogeneous ideal. We inductively construct an ordered
pair ($f_1$\,,\,$f_2$) of forms which generate $I_F$\,; our generators are
special in that $z$ does not divide the leading grlex monomial of $f_1$ but $z$
divides $f_2$\,, and the sum of their total degrees is always $2-|F|$, where
$|F|$ is the total degree of $F$. We show that $f_1,f_2$ is a maximal regular
sequence for $I_F$, so that the height of $I_F$ is 2. The corresponding
algorithm is $\sim |F|^2/2$.
  The row vector obtained by accumulating intermediate forms of the
construction gives a minimal grlex Gr\""obner basis for $I_F$ for no extra
computational cost other than storage and apply this to determining $\dim_K
(K[x,z] /I_F)$\,. We show that either the form vector is reduced or a monomial
of $f_1$ can be reduced by $f_2$\,. This enables us to efficiently construct
the unique reduced Gr\""obner basis for $I_F$ from the vector extension of our
algorithm.
  Then we specialise to the inverse form of a finite sequence, obtaining
generator forms for its annihilator ideal and a corresponding algorithm which
does not use the last 'length change' of Massey. We compute the intersection of
two annihilator ideals using syzygies in $K[x,z]^5$. This improves a result of
Althaler \& D\""ur. Finally, dehomogenisation induces a one-to-one
correspondence ($f_1$\,,$f_2$) $\mapsto$ (minimal polynomial, auxiliary

algorithm. So we can also solve the LFSR synthesis problem via the

generalizes some classic existing complexity notions in learning theory: for
estimators like empirical risk minimization (ERM) with arbitrary bounded
losses, it is upper bounded in terms of data-independent Rademacher complexity;
for generalized Bayesian estimators, it is upper bounded by the data-dependent
information complexity (also known as stochastic or PAC-Bayesian,
$\mathrm{KL}(\text{posterior} \operatorname{\|} \text{prior})$ complexity. For
(penalized) ERM, the new complexity reduces to (generalized) normalized maximum
likelihood (NML) complexity, i.e. a minimax log-loss individual-sequence
regret. Our first main result bounds excess risk in terms of the new
complexity. Our second main result links the new complexity via Rademacher
complexity to $L_2(P)$ entropy, thereby generalizing earlier results of Opper,
Haussler, Lugosi, and Cesa-Bianchi who did the log-loss case with $L_\infty$.
Together, these results recover optimal bounds for VC- and large (polynomial
entropy) classes, replacing localized Rademacher complexity by a simpler
analysis which almost completely separates the two aspects that determine the
achievable rates: 'easiness' (Bernstein) conditions and model complexity.

spatiotemporal coherent structures from high-dimensional data, benefiting from
a strong connection to nonlinear dynamical systems via the Koopman operator. In
this work, we integrate and unify two recent innovations that extend DMD to
systems with actuation [Proctor et al., 2016] and systems with heavily
subsampled measurements [Brunton et al., 2015]. When combined, these methods
yield a novel framework for compressive system identification [code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/zhbai/cDMDc]. It is possible to identify a
low-order model from limited input-output data and reconstruct the associated
full-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to
the state of the reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data is
available, it is possible to dramatically accelerate downstream computations by
first compressing the data. We demonstrate this unified framework on two model
systems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of
measurements (e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.),
compression ratios, and different choices of actuation (e.g., localized,
broadband, etc.). In the first example, we explore this architecture on a test
system with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state
dimension. The second example consists of a real-world engineering application
given by the fluid flow past a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This
example provides a challenging and realistic test-case for the proposed method,
and results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well
characterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data.

counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. Our method uses the abstract
semantics of the underlying DSL to find a program $P$ whose abstract behavior
satisfies the examples. However, since program $P$ may be spurious with respect
to the concrete semantics, our approach iteratively refines the abstraction
until we either find a program that satisfies the examples or prove that no
such DSL program exists. Because many programs have the same input-output
behavior in terms of their abstract semantics, this synthesis methodology
significantly reduces the search space compared to existing techniques that use
purely concrete semantics. While synthesis using abstraction refinement
(SYNGAR) could be implemented in different settings, we propose a
refinement-based synthesis algorithm that uses abstract finite tree automata
(AFTA). Our technique uses a coarse initial program abstraction to construct an
initial AFTA, which is iteratively refined by constructing a proof of
incorrectness of any spurious program. In addition to ruling out the spurious
program accepted by the previous AFTA, proofs of incorrectness are also useful
for ruling out many other spurious programs. We implement these ideas in a
framework called \tool. We have used the BLAZE framework to build synthesizers
for string and matrix transformations, and we compare BLAZE with existing
techniques. Our results for the string domain show that BLAZE compares
favorably with FlashFill, a domain-specific synthesizer that is now deployed in
Microsoft PowerShell. In the context of matrix manipulations, we compare BLAZE

show that BLAZE results in a 90x speed-up over Prose.

their neighborhood. For linear problems we can specify the conditions under
which posterior moments of the localized problem are close to those of the

independent of dimension for localized linear problems. Nonlinear problems can

superconductors, we deduce and find the correlation strength not revealed
before, contributing to the formation of the Cooper pair and the 2-D density of
state, and demonstrate the pairing symmetry in the superconductors still
controversial. To the open questions, the fitting and analysis of the diverging
effective mass with decreasing doping, extracted from the acquired
quantum-oscillation data in underdoped YBCOO$_{6+x}$ superconductors, can
provide solutions. Here, the results of the fitting using the extended
Brinkman-Rice(BR) picture reveal the nodal constant Fermi energy with the
maximum carrier density, a constant Coulomb correlation strength
$k_{BR}$=$U/U_c$>0.90, and a growing Fermi arc from the nodal Fermi point to
the isotropic Fermi surface with an increasing $x$. The growing of the Fermi
arc indicates that a superconducting gap develops with $x$ from the node to the
anti-node. The large $k_{BR}$ results from the $d$-wave MIT for the pseudogap
phase in lightly doped superconductors, which can be direct evidence for
high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The quantum critical point is regarded as the
nodal Fermi point satisfied with the BR picture. The experimentally-measured
mass diverging behavior is an average effect and the true effective mass is
constant. As an application of the nodal constant carrier density, to find a
superconducting node gap, the ARPES data and tunneling data are analyzed. The
superconducting node gap is a precursor of $s$-wave symmetry in underdoped
cuprates. The half-flux quantum, induced by the circulation of $d$-wave
supercurrent and observed by the phase sensitive Josephson-pi junction
experiments, is not shown due to anisotropic or asymmetric effect appearing in
superconductors with trapped flux. The absence of $d$-wave superconducting
pairing symmetry is also revealed.

$NB_F$, quantifying respectively the balancedness of general functions $F$
between finite Abelian groups and the (global) balancedness of their
derivatives $D_a F(x)=F(x+a)-F(x)$, $a\in G\setminus\{0\}$ (providing an
indicator of the nonlinearity of the functions). These authors studied the
properties and cryptographic significance of these two measures. They provided
for S-boxes inequalities relating the nonlinearity $\mathcal{NL}(F)$ to $NB_F$,
and obtained in particular an upper bound on the nonlinearity which unifies
Sidelnikov-Chabaud-Vaudenay's bound and the covering radius bound. At the
Workshop WCC 2009 and in its postproceedings in 2011, a further study of these
parameters was made; in particular, the first parameter was applied to the
functions $F+L$ where $L$ is affine, providing more nonlinearity parameters.
  In 2010, motivated by the study of Costas arrays, two parameters called
ambiguity and deficiency were introduced by Panario \emph{et al.} for
permutations over finite Abelian groups to measure the injectivity and
surjectivity of the derivatives respectively. These authors also studied some
fundamental properties and cryptographic significance of these two measures.
Further studies followed without that the second pair of parameters be compared
to the first one.
  In the present paper, we observe that ambiguity is the same parameter as
$NB_F$, up to additive and multiplicative constants (i.e. up to rescaling). We
make the necessary work of comparison and unification of the results on $NB_F$,
respectively on ambiguity, which have been obtained in the five papers devoted
to these parameters. We generalize some known results to any Abelian groups and
we more importantly derive many new results on these parameters.

energy range along tilt direction (> 1 eV) and the NRs are formed by three
strongly entangled bands. Under symmetry-preserving strain, each NR would
evolve into four droplet-shaped NRs before fading away, producing distinct
evolution compared with that in usual two-band NR. When SOC is included, TNPs
would transform into type-II Dirac points while all the NRs have gaped.

method where the quasiparticle weight is set to unity. This relation allows to
easily transpose extensions of a given method to another: for instance, a
temperature-dependent version of RISB can be used to derive a
temperature-dependent free-energy formula for DMET.

prize collecting traveling salesman problem (PCTSP) and the prize collecting
Steiner tree problem (PCSTP) in doubling metrics. Given a metric space and a
penalty function on a subset of points known as terminals, a solution is a
subgraph on points in the metric space, whose cost is the weight of its edges
plus the penalty due to terminals not covered by the subgraph. Under our
unified framework, the solution subgraph needs to be Eulerian for PCTSP, while
it needs to be connected for PCSTP. Before our work, even a QPTAS for the
problems in doubling metrics is not known.
  Our unified PTAS is based on the previous dynamic programming frameworks
proposed in [Talwar STOC 2004] and [Bartal, Gottlieb, Krauthgamer STOC 2012].
However, since it is unknown which part of the optimal cost is due to edge
lengths and which part is due to penalties of uncovered terminals, we need to
develop new techniques to apply previous divide-and-conquer strategies and
sparse instance decompositions.

agreement with a numerical evaluation of spin injection and diffusion that
explicitly takes the size of the injector contact into account. The giant spin
accumulation originates from the large tunnel spin polarization of the Fe/MgO
contacts (53 % at 10 K and 18 % at 300 K), and the spin density enhancement
achieved by using a spin injector with a size comparable to the spin-diffusion

Ge76, by using high-purity germanium detectors made from isotopically enriched
material. The combination of the novel experimental design, the careful
material selection for radio-purity and the active/passive shielding techniques
result in a very low residual background at the Q-value of the decay, about
1e-3 counts/(keV kg yr). This makes GERDA the first experiment in the field to
be background-free for the complete design exposure of 100 kg yr. A search for
neutrinoless double beta decay was performed with a total exposure of 47.7 kg
yr: 23.2 kg yr come from the second phase (Phase II) of the experiment, in
which the background is reduced by about a factor of ten with respect to the
previous phase. The analysis presented in this paper includes 12.4 kg yr of new
Phase II data. No evidence for a possible signal is found: the lower limit for
the half-life of Ge76 is 8.0e25 yr at 90% CL. The experimental median
sensitivity is 5.8e25 yr. The experiment is currently taking data. As it is
running in a background-free regime, its sensitivity grows linearly with
exposure and it is expected to surpass 1e26 yr within 2018.

naturally due to the strong, intrinsic instability of line-driving (the `LDI').
But LDI wind models have so far mostly been limited to 1D, mainly because of
severe computational challenges regarding calculation of the multi-dimensional
radiation force. Aims: To simulate and examine the dynamics and
multi-dimensional nature of wind structure resulting from the LDI. Methods: We
introduce a `pseudo-planar', `box-in-a-wind' method that allows us to
efficiently compute the line-force in the radial and lateral directions, and
then use this approach to carry out 2D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of
the time-dependent wind. Results: Our 2D simulations show that the LDI first
manifests itself by mimicking the typical shell-structure seen in 1D models,
but how these shells then quickly break up into complex 2D density and velocity
structures, characterized by small-scale density `clumps' embedded in larger
regions of fast and rarefied gas. Key results of the simulations are that
density-variations in the well-developed wind statistically are quite isotropic
and that characteristic length-scales are small; a typical clump size is ~0.01R
at 2R, thus resulting also in rather low typical clump-masses ~10^17 g.
Overall, our results agree well with the theoretical expectation that the
characteristic scale for LDI-generated wind-structure is of order the Sobolev
length. We further confirm some earlier results that lateral `filling-in' of
radially compressed gas leads to somewhat lower clumping factors in 2D
simulations than in comparable 1D models. We conclude by discussing an
extension of our method toward rotating LDI wind models that exhibit an
intriguing combination of large- and small-scale structure extending down to
the wind base.

space framework. There is by now a fully developed statistical toolbox allowing
for the principled application of the functional data machinery to real-world
problems, often based on dimension reduction techniques such as functional
principal component analysis. At the same time, there have recently been a
number of publications that sidestep dimension reduction steps and focus on a
fully functional $L^2$-methodology. This paper goes one step further and
develops data analysis methodology for functional time series in the space of
all continuous functions. The work is motivated by the fact that objects with
rather different shapes may still have a small $L^2$-distance and are therefore
identified as similar when using an $L^2$-metric. However, in applications it
is often desirable to use metrics reflecting the visualization of the curves in
the statistical analysis. The methodological contributions are focused on
developing two-sample and change-point tests as well as confidence bands, as
these procedures appear do be conducive to the proposed setting. Particular
interest is put on relevant differences; that is, on not trying to test for
exact equality, but rather for pre-specified deviations under the null
hypothesis.
  The procedures are justified through large-sample theory. To ensure
practicability, non-standard bootstrap procedures are developed and
investigated addressing particular features that arise in the problem of
testing relevant hypotheses. The finite sample properties are explored through
a simulation study and an application to annual temperature profiles.

optimization problems due to its low iterative cost. However, SGD can not
achieve linear convergence rate as FGD (Full Gradient Descent) because of the
inherent gradient variance. To attack the problem, mini-batch SGD was proposed
to get a trade-off in terms of convergence rate and iteration cost. In this
paper, a general CVI (Convergence-Variance Inequality) equation is presented to
state formally the interaction of convergence rate and gradient variance. Then
a novel algorithm named SSAG (Stochastic Stratified Average Gradient) is
introduced to reduce gradient variance based on two techniques, stratified
sampling and averaging over iterations that is a key idea in SAG (Stochastic
Average Gradient). Furthermore, SSAG can achieve linear convergence rate of
$\mathcal {O}((1-\frac{\mu}{8CL})^k)$ at smaller storage and iterative costs,
where $C\geq 2$ is the category number of training data. This convergence rate
depends mainly on the variance between classes, but not on the variance within
the classes. In the case of $C\ll N$ ($N$ is the training data size), SSAG's
convergence rate is much better than SAG's convergence rate of $\mathcal
{O}((1-\frac{\mu}{8NL})^k)$. Our experimental results show SSAG outperforms SAG
and many other algorithms.

We also employed the Herschel far-IR and submillimetre, and WISE IR data
available for G304.74. The SABOCA data show that G304.74 is composed of a dense
filamentary structure with a mean width of only $0.18\pm0.05$ pc. The
percentage of LABOCA clumps that are found to be fragmented into SABOCA cores
is $36\%\pm16\%$. The WISE data suggest that $65\%\pm18\%$ of the SABOCA cores
host young stellar objects (YSOs). The mean dust temperature of the clumps,
derived by comparing the Herschel/SPIRE flux densities, was found to be $15.0
\pm 0.8$ K. The mean mass, beam-averaged H$_2$ column density, and H$_2$ number
density of the LABOCA clumps are estimated to be $55\pm10$ M$_{\odot}$,
$(2.0\pm0.2)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and $(3.1\pm0.2)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$.
The corresponding values for the SABOCA cores are $29\pm3$ M$_{\odot}$,
$(2.9\pm0.3)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and $(7.9\pm1.2)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$.
The G304.74 filament is estimated to be thermally supercritical by a factor of
$\gtrsim3.5$ on the scale probed by LABOCA, and by a factor of $ \gtrsim1.5$
for the SABOCA filament. Our data strongly suggest that G304.74 has undergone
hierarchical fragmentation. The IRDC G304.74 has a seahorse-like morphology in
the Herschel images, and the filament appears to be attached by elongated,
perpendicular striations. Besides the presence of perpendicularly oriented,
dusty striations and potential embedded intermediate-mass YSOs, G304.74 is a
relatively nearby ($d\sim2.5$ kpc) IRDC, which makes it a useful target for
future star formation studies. Owing to its observed morphology, we propose
that G304.74 could be nicknamed the Seahorse Nebula.

multiscale simulation method for particle dynamics or particle-based
reaction-diffusion dynamics that is suited for systems involving low particle
densities. Particles in a low-density region are just diffusing and not
interacting. In this case one can avoid the costly integration of microscopic
equations of motion, such as molecular dynamics (MD), and instead turn to an
event-based scheme in which the times to the next particle interaction and the
new particle positions at that time can be sampled. At high (local)
concentrations, however, e.g. when particles are interacting in a nontrivial
way, particle positions must still be updated with small time steps of the
microscopic dynamical equations. The efficiency of a multi-scale simulation
that uses these two schemes largely depends on the coupling between them and
the decisions when to switch between the two scales. Here we present an
efficient scheme for multi-scale MD-GFRD simulations. It has been shown that
MD-GFRD schemes are more efficient than brute-force molecular dynamics
simulations up to a molar concentration of $10^{2}\mu M$. In this paper, we
show that the choice of the propagation domains has a relevant impact on the
computational performance. Domains are constructed using a local optimization
of their sizes and a minimal domain size is proposed. The algorithm is shown to
be more efficient than brute-force Brownian dynamics simulations up to a molar
concentration of $10^{3}\mu M$ and is up to an order of magnitude more
efficient compared with previous MD-GFRD schemes.

(IACT) to reconstruct the energy and direction of incoming gamma-ray photons
from the universe, several source-classes have been revealed by previous and
current generations of IACT telescopes (e.g. Whipple, MAGIC, HESS and VERITAS).
The next generation pointing IACT experiment, the Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA), will provide increased sensitivity across a wider energy range and with
better angular resolution. With the development of CTA, the future of IACT
pointing arrays is being directed towards having more and more telescopes (and
hence cameras), and therefore the need to develop low-cost pixels with
acceptable light-collection efficiency is clear. One of the primary paths to
the above goal is to replace Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) with Silicon-PMs
(SiPMs) as the pixels in IACT telescope cameras. However SiPMs are not yet
mature enough to replace PMTs for several reasons: sensitivity to unwanted
longer wavelengths while lacking sensitivity at short wavelengths, small
physical area, high cost, optical cross-talk and dark rates. Here we propose a
novel method to build relatively low-cost SiPM-based pixels utilising a disk of
wavelength-shifting material, which overcomes some of these drawbacks by
collecting light over a larger area than standard SiPMs and improving
sensitivity to shorter wavelengths while reducing background. We aim to
optimise the design of such pixels, integrating them into an actual 7-pixel
cluster which will be inserted into a MAGIC camera and tested during real
observations. Results of simulations, laboratory measurements and the current

dispersions of monolayer, bilayer and double-layer phosphorene structures in

energy limit, these effects can be modeled through the change in the curvature
of the anisotropic energy band along the armchair and zigzag directions. We
derive analytical relations for the plasmon modes under uniaxial strain and
show that the direction of the applied strain is important. Moreover, we
observe that along the armchair direction, the changes of the plasmon
dispersion with strain are different and larger than those along the zigzag
direction. Using the analytical relations for two-layer phosphorene systems, we
find that the strain-dependent orientation factor of layers could be considered
as a means to control the variations of the plasmon energy. Furthermore, our
study shows that the plasmonic collective modes are more affected when the
strain is applied equally to the layers compared to the case in which the
strain is applied asymmetrically to the layers. We also calculate the effect of
strain on the drag resistivity in a double-layer phosphorene structure and
obtain that the changes in the plasmonic excitations, due to an applied strain,
are mainly responsible for the predicted results. This study can be easily
extended to other anisotropic two-dimensional materials.

frequency and momentum resolved spin-spin correlation functions of a dimerized
spin-1/2 chain under a magnetic field at finite temperature. The spectral
features strongly depend on the regime of the magnetic field. For increasing
magnetic fields, the transitions from a gapped spin liquid phase to a
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, and then to a totally polarized phase, can be
identified in the spectra. Compared to the zero temperature case, the finite
temperature excitations give rise to additional spectral features that we
compute numerically and identify analytically as transitions from thermally
excited states. We compute quantitatively the broadening of the dispersion of a
single spin-flip excitation due to the temperature and find a strong asymmetric
broadening. We discuss the consequences of these findings for neutron
experiments on dimerized one dimensional quantum chains.

relaying millimeter-wave (mm-wave) system, where two AF relaying schemes, i.e.,
half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) are discussed. By considering the two-ray
mm-wave channel and the Gaussian-type directional antenna, jointly, the impacts
of the beamwidth and the self-interference coefficient on maximum achievable
rates are investigated. Results show that, under a sum-power constraint, the
rate of FD-AF mm-wave relaying outperforms its HD counterpart only when
antennas with narrower beamwidth and smaller self-interference coefficient are
applied. However, when the sum-power budget is sufficiently high or the
beamwidth of directional antenna is sufficiently small, direct transmission
becomes the best strategy, rather than the AF relaying schemes. For both
relaying schemes, we show that the rates of both AF relaying schemes scale as $
\mathcal{O}\left(\min\left\lbrace\theta_m^{-1},\theta_m^{-2}\right\rbrace\right)
$ with respect to beamwidth $ \theta_ m $, and the rate of FD-AF relaying
scales as $ \mathcal{O}\left(\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right) $ with respect to
self-interference coefficient $ \mu $. Besides, we show that, ground
reflections may significantly affect the performance of mm-wave communications,
constructively or destructively. Thus, the impact of ground reflections
deserves careful considerations for analyzing or designing future mm-wave
wireless networks.

to and solved as a discriminative learning problem based on Monte Carlo samples
generated with power flow simulations. A major advantage of the developed
Learning-to-Infer method is that the labeled data used for training can be
generated in an arbitrarily large amount rapidly and at very little cost. As a
result, the power of offline training is fully exploited to learn very complex
classifiers for effective real-time multi-line outage identification. The
proposed methods are evaluated in the IEEE 30, 118 and 300 bus systems.
Excellent performance in identifying multi-line outages in real time is

distinct electron populations exist, namely cool and hot electrons. The
observations revealed that the hot electron distribution often has a
long-tailed suprathermal (non-Maxwellian) form. The aim of the present study is
to investigate how various plasma parameters modify the electron-acoustic
structures. We have studied the electron-acoustic waves in a collisionless and
unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial electrons, hot suprathermal
electrons, and mobile ions. First, we started with a cold one-fluid model, and
we extended it to a warm model, including the electron thermal pressure.
Finally, the ion inertia was included in a two-fluid model. The linear
dispersion relations for electron-acoustic waves depicted a strong dependence
of the charge screening mechanism on excess suprathermality. A nonlinear
(Sagdeev) pseudopotential technique was employed to investigate the existence
of electron-acoustic solitary waves, and to determine how their characteristics
depend on various plasma parameters. The results indicate that the thermal
pressure deeply affects the electron-acoustic solitary waves. Only negative
polarity waves were found to exist in the one-fluid model, which become
narrower as deviation from the Maxwellian increases, while the wave amplitude
at fixed soliton speed increases. However, for a constant value of the true
Mach number, the amplitude decreases for increasing suprathermality. It is also
found that the ion inertia has a trivial role in the supersonic domain, but it
is important to support positive polarity waves in the subsonic domain.

group of partons can lead to more jet quenching effect in the hot and dense
matter created by heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We came to
this picture after analyzing the behaviour of the nuclear modification factor
as a function of $p_T$ for the charged particles produced in the most central
Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 A TeV. In the interval, $7-50 GeV/c$ the values of the
factor as a function of $p_T$ increases almost linearly with a slope is very
close to expected one for the inverse Compton effect. Around $p_T\simeq 60$
GeV/c, a regime change occurs, which is characteristic for the phenomenon. We
propose that this similarity can be explained by the inverse Compton effect for
partons, which occurs via a collective parton group formation ( through the
appearance of a new string as a result of the fusion of strings) and its
interactions with single partons in the interval of $5 < p_T < 10 GeV/c$. In
the case of a coherent collision with a parton that has a lower energy than the
group, the parton can gain energy through the inverse Compton effect, resulting
in its acceleration and shifting to the region of $p_T >10$ GeV/c. After losing
a significant part of its energy new string will decay into partons with lower
energies - slowed partons in the interval of $p_T < 5 GeV/c$. This enhancement
in the jet quenching can be observed in the interval of $2 <p_T <20 GeV/c$.
