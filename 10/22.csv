which polynomials only have complex roots if a real initial condition is taken.
In the present work, we explain an iterative method that is created using the
fractional calculus, which we will call the Fractional Newton-Raphson (F N-R)
Method, which has the ability to enter the space of complex numbers given a
real initial condition, which allows us to find both the real and complex roots
of a polynomial unlike the classical Newton-Raphson method.

the core of their formulations. By using tuneable interface stabilizing agents,
such emulsions can self-assemble into complex structures. DNA has been used for
decades as a thermoresponsive highly specific binding agent between hard and,
recently, soft colloids. Up until now, emulsion droplets functionalized with
DNA had relatively low coating densities and were expensive to scale up. Here a
general O/W DNA-coating method using functional non-ionic amphiphilic block
copolymers, both diblock and triblock, is presented. The hydrophilic
polyethylene glycol ends of the surfactants are functionalized with azides,
allowing for efficient, dense and controlled coupling of dibenzocyclooctane
functionalized DNA to the polymers through a strain-promoted alkyne-azide click
reaction. The protocol is readily scalable due to the triblock's commercial
availability. Different production methods (ultrasonication, microfluidics and
membrane emulsification) are used with different oils (hexadecane and silicone
oil) to produce functional droplets in various size ranges (sub-micron, $\sim
20\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ and $> 50\,\mathrm{\mu m}$), showcasing the generality of
the protocol. Thermoreversible sub-micron emulsion gels, hierarchical
""raspberry"" droplets and controlled droplet release from a flat DNA-coated
surface are demonstrated. The emulsion stability and polydispersity is
evaluated using dynamic light scattering and optical microscopy. The generality
and simplicity of the method opens up new applications in soft matter and

temperature-induced changes in the terahertz conductivity spectra are shown to
depend strongly on the average CNT length, with a conductivity around 1 THz
that increases/decreases as the temperature increases for short/long tubes.
This behaviour originates from the temperature dependence of the electron
scattering rate, which we obtain from Drude fits of the measured conductivity
in the range 0.3-2 THz for 10 $\mu$m length CNTs. This increasing scattering
rate with temperature results in a subsequent broadening of the observed THz
conductivity peak at higher temperatures and a shift to lower frequencies for
increasing CNT length. Finally, we show that the change in conductivity with
temperature depends not only on tube length, but also varies with tube density.
We record the effective conductivities of composite films comprising mixtures
of WS$_2$ nanotubes and CNTs vs CNT density for frequencies in the range 0.3-1
THz, finding that the conductivity increases/decreases for low/high density

made of at least three orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber that are
laminated by gluing longitudinal and transverse layers with structural
adhesives to form a solid panel. Previous studies have shown that the CLT
buildings can perform well in seismic loading and are recognized as the
essential role of connector performance in structural design, modelling, and
analysis of CLT buildings. When CLT is composed of high-grade/high-density
layers for the outer lamellas and low-grade/low-density for the core of the
panels, the CLT panels are herein designated as hybrid CLT panels as opposed to
conventional CLT panels that are built using one lumber type for both outer and

estimate the cyclic performance of CLT connectors applied on hybrid CLT layups.
Two connectors are selected, which can be used in wall-to-floor connections.
These are readily available in the North American market. Characterization of
the performance of connectors is done in two perpendicular directions under a
modified CUREE cyclic loading protocol. Depending on the mode of failure, in
some cases, testing results indicate that when the nails or screws penetrate
the low-grade/low-density core lumber, a statistically significant difference
is obtained between hybrid and conventional layups. However, in other cases,
due to damage in the face layer or in the connection, force-displacement
results for conventional and hybrid CLT layups were not statistically
significant.

and in Belykh map. The present article deals with the quasihyperbolic attractor
of Belykh in a map describing a rotator with dissipation driven by periodic
kicks, the intensity of which depends on the instantaneous angular coordinate
of the rotator as a sawtooth-like function, and also the transformation of the
attractor under smoothing of that function is considered. Reduction of the
equations to the standard form of the Belykh map is provided. Results of
computations illustrating the dynamics of the system with continuous time on
the Belykh attractor are presented. Also, results for the model with the
smoothed sawtooth function are considered depending on the parameter
characterizing the smoothing scale. On graphs of Lyapunov exponents versus a
parameter, the smoothing of the sawtooth implies appearance of periodicity
windows, which indicates violation of the quasi-hyperbolic nature of the
attractor. Charts of dynamic regimes on the parameter plane of the system are
also plotted, where regions of periodic motions (""Arnold's tongues"") are
present, which decrease in size with the decrease in the characteristic scale
of the smoothing, and disappear in the limit case of the sawtooth function with
a break. Since the Belykh attractor was originally introduced in the

classes, i.e., semantic memory (SM), is central to cognition. Machine learning
(ML), neural network, and AI research has been primarily driven by tasks
requiring such abilities. However, another central facet of cognition,
single-trial formation of permanent memories of experiences, i.e., episodic
memory (EM), has had relatively little focus. Only recently has EM-like
functionality been added to Deep Learning (DL) models, e.g., Neural Turing
Machine, Memory Networks. However, in these cases: a) EM is implemented as a
separate module, which entails substantial data movement (and so, time and
power) between the DL net itself and EM; and b) individual items are stored
localistically within the EM, precluding realizing the exponential
representational efficiency of distributed over localist coding. We describe
Sparsey, an unsupervised, hierarchical, spatial/spatiotemporal associative
memory model differing fundamentally from mainstream ML models, most crucially,
in its use of sparse distributed representations (SDRs), or, cell assemblies,
which admits an extremely efficient, single-trial learning algorithm that maps
input similarity into code space similarity (measured as intersection). SDRs of
individual inputs are stored in superposition and because similarity is
preserved, the patterns of intersections over the assigned codes reflect the
similarity, i.e., statistical, structure, of all orders, not simply pairwise,
over the inputs. Thus, SM, i.e., a generative model, is built as a
computationally free side effect of the act of storing episodic memory traces
of individual inputs, either spatial patterns or sequences. We report initial
results on MNIST and on the Weizmann video event recognition benchmarks. While
we have not yet attained SOTA class accuracy, learning takes only minutes on a
single CPU.

number of input channels used in each layer of a convolutional neural network
during feedforward inference. IDP adds monotonically non-increasing
coefficients, referred to as a ""profile"", to the channels during training. The
profile orders the contribution of each channel in non-increasing order. At
inference time, the number of channels used can be dynamically adjusted to
trade off accuracy for lowered power consumption and reduced latency by
selecting only a beginning subset of channels. This approach allows for a
single network to dynamically scale over a computation range, as opposed to
training and deploying multiple networks to support different levels of
computation scaling. Additionally, we extend the notion to multiple profiles,
each optimized for some specific range of computation scaling. We present
experiments on the computation and accuracy trade-offs of IDP for popular image
classification models and datasets. We demonstrate that, for MNIST and
CIFAR-10, IDP reduces computation significantly, e.g., by 75%, without
significantly compromising accuracy. We argue that IDP provides a convenient
and effective means for devices to lower computation costs dynamically to
reflect the current computation budget of the system. For example, VGG-16 with
50% IDP (using only the first 50% of channels) achieves 70% in accuracy on the
CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the standard network which achieves only 35%
accuracy when using the reduced channel set.

that RBM is treated as a generative model for classification purpose. The

Therefore, the knowledge of how the effective magnetic anisotropy Keff varies

recent paper [Appl. Phys. Lett. 110 (22), 222409 (2017)], the variation of Keff
versus D in NPs of maghemite ({\gamma}-Fe2O3) was best described by the Eq.:
Keff = Kb + (6KS/D) +Ksh{[1-(2d/D)]-3 -1}, where Kb, KS, and Ksh are the
anisotropy constants of spins in the core, surface layer, and a shell of
thickness d, respectively. This core-shell-surface layer (CSSL) model is an
extension of the often used core-surface layer (CSL) model described by Keff =
Kb + (6KS/D) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 282 (1994)]. The additional term involving
Ksh was found to be necessary to fit the data for smaller NPs of {\gamma}-Fe2O3
with D < 5 nm. Here we check the validity of the CSSL model for metallic
magnetic NPs of Co, Ni, Fe and magnetite using Keff vs. D data from published
literature. Care was taken in selecting data only for those NPs for which the
effects of interparticle interactions has been taken into account in
determining Keff. The importance of the new CSSL model is that it describes
well the Keff vs. D variation for all particles sizes whereas the core-surface

accurate representation of the evolutionary history of a set of present-day

gene transfer. One way to obtain such a network is by starting with a (rooted)
phylogenetic tree $T$, called a base tree, and adding arcs between arcs of $T$.
The class of phylogenetic networks that can be obtained in this way is called
tree-based networks and includes the prominent classes of tree-child and
reticulation-visible networks. Initially defined for binary phylogenetic
networks, tree-based networks naturally extend to arbitrary phylogenetic
networks. In this paper, we generalise recent tree-based characterisations and
associated proximity measures for binary phylogenetic networks to arbitrary
phylogenetic networks. These characterisations are in terms of matchings in
bipartite graphs, path partitions, and antichains. Some of the generalisations
are straightforward to establish using the original approach, while others
require a very different approach. Furthermore, for an arbitrary tree-based
network $N$, we characterise the support trees of $N$, that is, the tree-based
embeddings of $N$. We use this characterisation to give an explicit formula for
the number of support trees of $N$ when $N$ is binary. This formula is written
in terms of the components of a bipartite graph.

  Using Moment-Based Spectral Analysis","12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical
  Imaging",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In high-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging applications, time-consuming,
sequential acquisition of data samples in the spatial frequency domain
($k$-space) can often be accelerated by accounting for dependencies along
imaging dimensions other than space in linear reconstruction, at the cost of
noise amplification that depends on the sampling pattern. Examples are
support-constrained, parallel, and dynamic MRI, and $k$-space sampling
strategies are primarily driven by image-domain metrics that are expensive to
compute for arbitrary sampling patterns. It remains challenging to provide
systematic and computationally efficient automatic designs of arbitrary
multidimensional Cartesian sampling patterns that mitigate noise amplification,
given the subspace to which the object is confined. To address this problem,
this work introduces a theoretical framework that describes local geometric
properties of the sampling pattern and relates these properties to a measure of
the spread in the eigenvalues of the information matrix described by its first
two spectral moments. This new criterion is then used for very efficient
optimization of complex multidimensional sampling patterns that does not
require reconstructing images or explicitly mapping noise amplification.
Experiments with in vivo data show strong agreement between this criterion and
traditional, comprehensive image-domain- and $k$-space-based metrics,
indicating the potential of the approach for computationally efficient
(on-the-fly), automatic, and adaptive design of sampling patterns.

relativity? Thirty years ago, Shimony hoped that isolating the culprit (i.e.
the false assumption) in proofs of Bell inequalities as Outcome Independence
would secure such peaceful coexistence: or, if not secure it, at least show a
way---maybe the best or only way---to secure it.
  In this paper, I begin by being sceptical of Shimony's approach, urging that
we need a relativistic solution to the quantum measurement problem (Section 2).
Then I analyse Outcome Independence in Kent's realist one-world
Lorentz-invariant interpretation of quantum theory (Sections 3 and 4). Then I
consider Shimony's other condition, Parameter Independence, both in Kent's
proposal and more generally, in the light of recent remarkable theorems by
Colbeck, Renner and Leegwater (Section 5).
  For both Outcome Independence and Parameter Independence, there is a striking
analogy with the situation in pilot-wave theory. Finally, I will suggest that
these recent theorems make some kind of peaceful coexistence mandatory for
someone who, like Shimony, endorses Parameter Independence.

that the cost of recovery of the newly elected coordinator's state is at the

seamless approach effectively solves the temporary unavailability problem, its
adoption entails uninterrupted execution of the application. Our solution
removes the restriction that the occurrence of coordinator replacements is
something to be avoided, allowing the decoupling of the application execution
from the accuracy of the mechanism used to choose a coordinator. This result
increases the performance of the application even in the presence of failures,

natural platform for realization of exotic supersolid phase. On one hand,
fermionic edge modes are helical due to the nontrivial topology of the bulk. On
the other hand, a disorder at the edge or magnetic adatoms may produce a dense
array of localized spins interacting with the helical electrons. The spin
subsystem is magnetically frustrated since the indirect exchange favors
formation of helical spin order and the direct one favors (anti)ferromagnetic
ordering of the spins. At a moderately strong direct exchange, the competition
between these spin interactions results in the spontaneous breaking of parity
and in the Ising type order of the $z$-components at zero temperature. If the
total spin is conserved the spin order does not pin a collective massless
helical mode which supports the ideal transport. In this case, the phase
transition converts the helical spin order to the order of a chiral lattice
supersolid. This represents a radically new possibility for experimental
studies of the elusive supersolidity.

the symplectic transformation $x \leftrightarrow y$ on the spectral curve in
the context of topological recursion. We conjecture that the generating series

adversarial examples has raised serious safety concerns. Most existing
approaches for crafting adversarial examples necessitate some knowledge
(architecture, parameters, etc.) of the network at hand. In this paper, we
focus on image classifiers and propose a feature-guided black-box approach to
test the safety of deep neural networks that requires no such knowledge. Our
algorithm employs object detection techniques such as SIFT (Scale Invariant
Feature Transform) to extract features from an image. These features are
converted into a mutable saliency distribution, where high probability is
assigned to pixels that affect the composition of the image with respect to the
human visual system. We formulate the crafting of adversarial examples as a
two-player turn-based stochastic game, where the first player's objective is to
minimise the distance to an adversarial example by manipulating the features,
and the second player can be cooperative, adversarial, or random. We show that,
theoretically, the two-player game can con- verge to the optimal strategy, and
that the optimal strategy represents a globally minimal adversarial image. For
Lipschitz networks, we also identify conditions that provide safety guarantees
that no adversarial examples exist. Using Monte Carlo tree search we gradually
explore the game state space to search for adversarial examples. Our
experiments show that, despite the black-box setting, manipulations guided by a
perception-based saliency distribution are competitive with state-of-the-art
methods that rely on white-box saliency matrices or sophisticated optimization
procedures. Finally, we show how our method can be used to evaluate robustness
of neural networks in safety-critical applications such as traffic sign
recognition in self-driving cars.

strong-field gravity. Approximate universal relations insensitive to the star's
internal structure exist among certain observables and are useful in testing
General Relativity, as they project out the uncertainties in the equation of
state. One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,
the tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in
General Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the
relations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating
effective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we
study how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend
on the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love
number with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be
measured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds
on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger
than current bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this
theory by constructing slowly-rotating neutron star solutions to quadratic
order in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues to hold in
dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in
General Relativity, although its existence depends on the normalization of the
dimensional coupling constant of the theory. Finally, we study the variation of
the eccentricity of isodensity contours inside a star and its relation to the
degree of universality. We find that, in most cases, the eccentricity variation
is smaller in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity than in General Relativity,
providing further support to the idea that the approximate self-similarity of
isodensity contours is responsible for universality.

that is, networks in which a fraction of the vehicles on each road are equipped
with autonomous capabilities such as adaptive cruise control that enable
reduced headways and increased road capacity. Motivated by capacity models
developed for such roads with mixed autonomy, we consider transportation
networks in which the delay on each road or link is an affine function of two
quantities: the number of vehicles with autonomous capabilities on the link and
the number of regular vehicles on the link. We particularly study the price of
anarchy for such networks, that is, the ratio of the total delay experienced by
selfish routing to the socially optimal routing policy. Unlike the case when
all vehicles are of the same type, for which the price of anarchy is known to
be bounded, we first show that the price of anarchy can be arbitrarily large
for such mixed autonomous networks. Next, we define a notion of asymmetry equal
to the maximum possible travel time improvement due to the presence of
autonomous vehicles. We show that when the degree of asymmetry of all links in
the network is bounded by a factor less than 4, the price of anarchy is
bounded. We also bound the bicriteria, which is a bound on the cost of
selfishly routing traffic compared to the cost of optimally routing additional
traffic. These bounds depend on the degree of asymmetry and recover classical
bounds on the price of anarchy and bicriteria in the case when no asymmetry
exists. Further, we show with examples that these bound are tight in particular
cases.

quantum annealing that allows for the encoding of a logical qubit into an
arbitrarily large number of physical qubits. The encoding replaces each logical
qubit by a complete graph of degree $C$. The nesting level $C$ represents the
distance of the error-correcting code and controls the amount of protection
against thermal and control errors. Theoretical mean-field analyses and
empirical data obtained with a D-Wave Two quantum annealer (supporting up to
$512$ qubits) showed that NQAC has the potential to achieve a scalable
effective temperature reduction, $T_{\rm eff} \sim C^{-\eta}$, with $\eta \leq
2$. We confirm that this scaling is preserved when NQAC is tested on a D-Wave
2000Q device (supporting up to $2048$ qubits). In addition, we show that NQAC
can be also used in sampling problems to lower the effective temperature of a

machine-learning applications. Since we demonstrate that NQAC achieves error
correction via an effective reduction of the temperature of the quantum

code and develop a new module to account for radiation pressure driving. In 2D,
our new simulations are consistent with previous 2D axisymmetric solutions by
Proga et al. who used the Zeus 2D code. Specifically, we find that the disc
winds are time dependent, characterized by a dense stream confined to $\sim
45^{\circ}$ relative to the disc midplane and bounded on the polar side by a
less dense, fast stream. Introducing a vertical, $\phi$-dependent, subsonic
velocity perturbation in the disc midplane does not change the overall
character of the solution but global outflow properties such as the mass,
momentum and kinetic energy fluxes are altered by up to 100%. Non-axisymmetric
density structures develop and persist mainly at the base of the wind. They are
relatively small, and their densities can be a few times higher that the
azimuthal average. The structure of the non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric
solutions differ also in other ways. Perhaps most importantly from the
observational point of view are the differences in the so called clumping
factors, that serve as a proxy for emissivity due to two body processes. In
particular, the spatially averaged clumping factor over the entire fast stream,
while it is of a comparable value in both solutions, it varies about 10 times
faster in the non-axisymmetric case.

combinations in semantic relations and basic graph patterns. Third, we design a

distinguish whether an aggregate item is numeric or not, which will greatly
affect the aggregate result. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over

24 or 22 microns, 422 are detected at the HSO 70 micron bandpass. Of these,
only 39 are detected at HSO 160 microns. The 70 micron peak surface
brightnesses are 0.5 to 2.5 Jy/square arcminute. Color temperatures calculated
from the 24 micron to 70 micron ratios range from 80 K to 400 K. Color
temperatures from 70 micron to 160 micron ratios are systematically lower, 40 K
to 200 K. Both of these temperature are, on average, 75% higher than the
nominal temperatures derived by assuming that dust is in steady-state radiative
equilibrium. This may be evidence of stellar wind bowshocks sweeping up and
heating --- possibly fragmenting but not destroying --- interstellar dust.
Infrared luminosity correlates with standoff distance, R_0, as predicted by
published hydrodynamical models. Infrared spectral energy distributions are
consistent with interstellar dust exposed to a either single radiant energy
density, U=10^3 to 10^5 (in more than half of the objects) or a range of
radiant energy densities U_min=25 to U_max=10^3 to 10^5 times the mean
interstellar value for the remainder. Hence, the central OB stars dominate the
energetics, making these enticing laboratories for testing dust models in
constrained radiation environments. SEDs are consistent with PAH fractions
q_PAH <1% in most objects.

(RTI). Even simple uniform shear strongly influences the instability; longer
waves are completely stabilized when density stratification is large (higher
Atwood numbers). This apparently counter-intuitive result is due to the
presence of Atwood number in the shear term. When the unstable density
interface is embedded in a shear layer, shear is again found to stabilize the
RTI. However, this configuration introduces additional unstable shear
instability modes in the lower wavenumber regime. A new type of shear
instability, whose growth rate increases with Atwood number, plays a dominant
role, while Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which was previously understood
to be the only possible shear instability in this context, has little
significance. Hence the billows observed in the nonlinear stages of RTI, which
are usually attributed to KHI, may actually be the nonlinear manifestation of
this new instability.

results demonstrate that performance increases when the amount of variations
introduced during agents evaluation and the rate at which the environment
varies throughout generations are moderate. This is explained by the fact that
the probability to retain genetic variations, including non-neutral variations

large-scale inter-cluster CSI is available. Channel estimation for
intra-cluster CSI is also considered, where we formulate a joint pilot

proposed by considering the multi-UE pilot interference. Then, we consider
robust beam-vector optimization problem subject to UEs' data rate requirements
and fronthaul capacity constraints, where the channel estimation error and
incomplete inter-cluster CSI are considered. The exact data rate is difficult
to obtain in closed form, and instead we conservatively replace it with its
lower-bound. The resulting problem is non-convex, combinatorial, and even
infeasible. A practical algorithm, based on UE selection, successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semi-definite relaxation approach, is proposed to solve
this problem with guaranteed convergence. We strictly prove that semidefinite

re-examine the pricing theories applied in electricity market design. The
theory of spot pricing is the basis of electricity market design in many
countries, but it has two major drawbacks: one is that it is still based on the
traditional hourly scheduling/dispatch model, ignores the crucial time
continuity in electric power production and consumption and does not treat the
inter-temporal constraints seriously; the second is that it assumes that the
electricity products are homogeneous in the same dispatch period and cannot
distinguish the base, intermediate and peak power with obviously different
technical and economic characteristics. To overcome the shortcomings, this
paper presents a continuous time commodity model of electricity, including spot
pricing model and load duration model. The market optimization models under the
two pricing mechanisms are established with the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals
respectively and the functional optimization problem are solved by the
Euler-Lagrange equation to obtain the market equilibria. The feasibility of
pricing according to load duration is proved by strict mathematical derivation.
Simulation results show that load duration pricing can correctly identify and
value different attributes of generators, reduce the total electricity
purchasing cost, and distribute profits among the power plants more equitably.
The theory and methods proposed in this paper will provide new ideas and
theoretical foundation for the development of electric power markets.

the formation of highly stable 2d-SiP and 2d-SiP$_2$ compounds with a weak
interlayer interaction. Our analysis demonstrates that these systems are
semiconductors with band gap energies that can be governed by varying the
thickness and stacking order. Specifically, siliconization of phosphorene
allows to design 2d-SiP$_x$ materials with significantly weaker thickness
dependence of electronic properties than that in 2d-P and to develop ways for
their tailoring. We also reveal the spatial dependence of electronic properties
for 2d-SiP$_x$ highlighting difference in effective band gaps for different

explore the option to directly use 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum band being used by
IEEE 802.11 (WiFi). However, as LTE is not designed with shared spectrum access
in mind, there is a major issue of coexistence with WiFi networks. Current
coexistence schemes to be deployed at the LTE-U BS create coexistence gaps only
in one domain (e.g., time, frequency, or space) and can provide only
incremental gains due to the lack of coordination among the coexisting WiFi and
LTE-U networks. Therefore, we propose a coordinated coexistence scheme which
relies on cooperation between neighboring LTE-U and WiFi networks. Our proposal
suggests that LTE-U BSs equipped with multiple antennas can create coexistence
gaps in space domain in addition to the time domain gaps by means of
cross-technology interference nulling towards WiFi nodes in the interference
range. In return, LTE-U can increase its own airtime utilization while trading
off slightly its antenna diversity. The cooperation offers benefits to both
LTE-U and WiFi in terms of improved throughput and decreased channel access
delay. More specifically, system-level simulations reveal a throughput gain up
to 221% for LTE-U network and 44% for WiFi network depending on the setting,
e.g., the distance between the two cell, number of LTE antennas, and WiFi users
in the LTE-U BS neighborhood. Our proposal provides significant benefits
especially for moderate separation distances between LTE-U/WiFi cells where
interference from a neighboring network might be severe due to the hidden

in the past 2,000,000 years. Recently, from around 1950, they started to be
diverted to slower trajectories but they are still close to the historical
hyperbolic trajectories. Regional growth of population and regional economic
growth were also hyperbolic. Hyperbolic growth can be slow over a long time and
fast over a short time but it is still the same, monotonically increasing,
growth. It is incorrect to interpret slow growth as stagnation and fast growth
as explosion, each controlled by different mechanisms of growth. Hyperbolic
growth has to be interpreted as a whole and the same mechanism has to be
applied to the slow and to the fast growth. The Anthropocene is characterised
by the rapid growth of population, rapid economic growth and rapid consumption
of natural resources. The origin of the Anthropocene can be explained as the
natural consequence of hyperbolic growth. However, while its dramatic impacts
became apparent only recently its starting point cannot be mathematically
determined. Its beginning could be traced to the dawn of the existence of
hominines. Its future is insecure because it is dictated by many critical

observed when using the new predicted flux and spectra. This problem has been
called the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA), which together with the gallium
anomaly, both show discrepancies with respect to the expectations at the $\sim$
3 $\sigma$ level. Oscillations into a light sterile neutrino state ($\Delta
m^{2} \sim 1eV^{2}$) could account for such deficits. The SoLid experiment has
been conceived to give an unambiguous response to the hypothesis of a light
sterile neutrino as the origin of the RAA. To this end, SoLid is searching for
an oscillation pattern at short baselines (6-9 m) in the energy spectrum of the

is highly segmented (modules of 10 planes of 16$\times$16 cubes), and it's read
out by a network of wavelength shifting fibers and SiPMs. The fine segmentation
and the hybrid technology of the detector allows the clear identification of
the neutrino signals, reducing significantly backgrounds. Thus, a high
experimental sensitivity can be achieved. A 288 kg prototype was deployed in

spintronics and quantum computations. Understanding the topological symplectic
transport of the Dirac fermions is a key issue to study and design the TI-based
devices. In this review, we introduce the progress on the universal conductance
fluctuation (UCF) of TSSs. Firstly, we report the two dimensional UCF
phenomenon in TIs, and its topological nature is demonstrated based on the
investigations of UCF by angle-varying, in-plane field tuning and scaling
analysis. Secondly, we discuss the statistical symmetry of UCF in TIs. For a
single TSS, the applied magnetic field will drive the system from a Gaussian
symplectic ensemble into a Gaussian unitary ensemble. It results a 2^0.5 fold
increase of the UCF amplitude. However, the experiment reveals a decreasing of
the UCF amplitude of 2^0.5 times. This is contradictory to the theoretical
prediction. Actually, there are two TSSs and they are coherently coupled to
each other in TIs since the sample's thickness is shorter than its bulk
dephasing length. This leads to a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of the interface
coupling system without an external field. In such situation, the UCF amplitude
will decrease by 2^0.5 times with the field increasing. It is consistent with
the experimental results. Finally, the other progress on UCFs is also

angles tend to accentuate the non- uniform flow, causing poor pressure
recovery. On the other hand, shallow diffuser angles create longer regions with
large wall drag, which is also detrimental to pressure recovery. Thus, optimal
diffuser shapes strike a balance between the two effects. We use a simple model

the diffuser. The model equations form the dynamics of an optimal control

$L^0$-optimal (or the sparsest) control among all feasible controls that are
bounded by a specified value and transfer the state from a given initial state
to the origin within a fixed time duration. In general, the maximum hands-off
control is a bang-off-bang control taking values of $\pm 1$ and $0$. For many
real applications, such discontinuity in the control is not desirable. To
obtain a continuous but still relatively sparse control, we propose to use the
CLOT norm, a convex combination of $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. We show by numerical
simulations that the CLOT control is continuous and much sparser (i.e. has
longer time duration on which the control takes 0) than the conventional EN
(elastic net) control, which is a convex combination of $L^1$ and squared $L^2$
norms. We also prove that the CLOT control is continuous in the sense that, if
$O(h)$ denotes the sampling period, then the difference between successive
values of the CLOT-optimal control is $O(\sqrt{h})$, which is a form of
continuity. Also, the CLOT formulation is extended to encompass constraints on

overall performance during its whole lifespan, considering both network
connectivity and network duration. We develop a framework for designing an
endurable network by allocating the expected lifetimes of its components, given
a limited budget. Based on percolation theory and simulation, we find that the
maximal network endurance can be achieved with a quantitative balance between
network duration and connectivity. For different endurance requirements, we
find that the optimal design can be separated into two categories: strong
dependence of lifetime on node's degree leads to larger network lifetime, while
weak dependence generates stronger network connectivity. Our findings could
help network design, by providing a quantitative prediction of network
endurance based on network topology.

  Coarse-graining Approach","45 pages, 11 figures, accepted in the Journal of Physical
  Oceanography",,"10.1175/JPO-D-17-0100.1",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A coarse-graining framework is implemented to analyze nonlinear processes,
measure energy transfer rates and map out the energy pathways from simulated
global ocean data. Traditional tools to measure the energy cascade from
turbulence theory, such as spectral flux or spectral transfer rely on the
assumption of statistical homogeneity, or at least a large separation between
the scales of motion and the scales of statistical inhomogeneity. The
coarse-graining framework allows for probing the fully nonlinear dynamics
simultaneously in scale and in space, and is not restricted by those
assumptions. This paper describes how the framework can be applied to ocean
flows.
  Energy transfer between scales is not unique due to a gauge freedom. Here, it
is argued that a Galilean invariant subfilter scale (SFS) flux is a suitable
quantity to properly measure energy scale-transfer in the Ocean. It is shown
that the SFS definition can yield answers that are qualitatively different from
traditional measures that conflate spatial transport with the scale-transfer of
energy. The paper presents geographic maps of the energy scale-transfer that
are both local in space and allow quasi-spectral, or scale-by-scale, dynamics
to be diagnosed. Utilizing a strongly eddying simulation of flow in the North
Atlantic Ocean, it is found that an upscale energy transfer does not hold
everywhere. Indeed certain regions, near the Gulf Stream and in the Equatorial
Counter Current have a marked downscale transfer. Nevertheless, on average an
upscale transfer is a reasonable mean description of the extra-tropical energy
scale-transfer over regions of O(10^3) kilometers in size.

  Robots and Systems (IROS) 2017",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Camera relocalization plays a vital role in many robotics and computer vision
tasks, such as global localization, recovery from tracking failure, and loop
closure detection. Recent random forests based methods directly predict 3D
world locations for 2D image locations to guide the camera pose optimization.
During training, each tree greedily splits the samples to minimize the spatial
variance. However, these greedy splits often produce uneven sub-trees in
training or incorrect 2D-3D correspondences in testing. To address these
problems, we propose a sample-balanced objective to encourage equal numbers of
samples in the left and right sub-trees, and a novel backtracking scheme to
remedy the incorrect 2D-3D correspondence predictions. Furthermore, we extend
the regression forests based methods to use local features in both training and
testing stages for outdoor RGB-only applications. Experimental results on
publicly available indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, which shows superior or on-par accuracy with several state-of-the-art
methods.

Ab initio calculations show that two-nucleon pair-densities exhibit strong spin

nuclei of current interest. We therefore provide a simple model, which involves
combining the short and long separation distance behavior using a single
blending function, to accurately describe the two-nucleon correlations inherent
in existing ab initio calculations. We show that the salient features of the
correlation function arise from the features of the two-body short-range
nuclear interaction, and that the suppression of the pp and nn pair-densities
caused by the Pauli principle is important. Our procedure for obtaining
pair-density functions and correlation functions can be applied to heavy nuclei

for materials with and without inversion symmetry. The former is known as the
Elliott-Yafet (EY) theory and for the latter the D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) theory
applies, respectively. We discuss herein a simple and intuitive approach to
demonstrate that the two seemingly disparate mechanisms are closely related. A
compelling analogy between the respective Hamiltonian is presented and that the
usual derivation of spin-relaxation times, in the respective frameworks of the
two theories, can be performed. The result also allows to obtain the less
canonical spin-relaxation regimes; the generalization of the EY when the
material has a large quasiparticle broadening and the DP mechanism in ultrapure
semiconductors. The method also allows a practical and intuitive numerical
implementation of the spin-relaxation calculation, which is demonstrated for
MgB$_2$ that has anomalous spin-relaxation properties.

saturable nonlinearity, including asymmetric cross-phase modulation (XPM)
parameters. Such equations can model phenomena described by complex
Ginzburg-Landau systems under the added assumption of saturable media. When the
saturation parameter is set to zero, we recover a general complex cubic
Ginzburg-Landau system with XPM. We first derive conditions for the existence
of bounded dynamics, approximating the absorbing set for solutions. We use this
to then determine conditions for amplitude death of a single wavefunction. We
also construct exact plane wave solutions, and determine conditions for their
modulational instability. In a degenerate limit where dispersion and
nonlinearity balance, we reduce our system to a saturable nonlinear
Schr\""odinger system with XPM parameters, and we demonstrate the existence and
behavior of spatially heterogeneous stationary solutions in this limit. Using
numerical simulations we verify the aforementioned analytical results, while
also demonstrating other interesting emergent features of the dynamics, such as
spatiotemporal chaos in the presence of modulational instability. In other
regimes, coherent patterns including uniform states or banded structures arise,
corresponding to certain stable stationary states. For sufficiently large yet
equal XPM parameters, we observe a segregation of wavefunctions into different
regions of the spatial domain, while when XPM parameters are large and take
different values, one wavefunction may decay to zero in finite time over the
spatial domain (in agreement with the amplitude death predicted analytically).
While saturation will often regularize the dynamics, such transient dynamics
can still be observed - and in some cases even prolonged - as the saturability
of the media is increased, as the saturation may act to slow the timescale.
