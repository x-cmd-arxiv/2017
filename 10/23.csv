on affine surfaces defined by $x^2 - ay^2 = P(t)$ over a number field. We
enumerate the possibilities for the Brauer groups of certain families of such
surfaces, and show that in contrast to their smooth compactifications, the
Brauer groups of these affine varieties need not be generated by cyclic (e.g.
quaternion) algebras. Concrete examples are given of such surfaces over
$\mathbb{Q}$ which have solutions in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for all $p$ and solutions
in $\mathbb{Q}$, but for which the failure of the integral Hasse principle
cannot be explained by a Brauer-Manin obstruction. The methods of this paper
build on the ideas of several recent papers in the literature: we study the
Brauer groups (modulo constant algebras) of affine Ch\^atelet surfaces with a
focus on explicitly representing, by central simple algebras over the function
field of $X$, a finite set of classes of the Brauer group which generate the
quotient. Notably, we develop techniques for constructing explicit
representatives of non-cyclic Brauer classes on affine surfaces, as well as
provide an effective algorithm for the computation of local invariants of these
Brauer classes via effective lifting of cocycles in Galois cohomology.

2.76 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider are obtained with the ALICE detector. The
longitudinal asymmetry arises because of an unequal number of participating
nucleons from the two colliding nuclei, and is estimated for each event by
measuring the energy in the forward neutron-Zero-Degree-Calorimeters (ZNs). The
effect of the longitudinal asymmetry is measured on the pseudorapidity
distributions of charged particles in the regions $|\eta| < 0.9$, $2.8 < \eta <
5.1$ and $-3.7 < \eta < -1.7 $ by taking the ratio of the pseudorapidity
distributions from events corresponding to different regions of asymmetry. The
coefficients of a polynomial fit to the ratio characterise the effect of the
asymmetry. A Monte Carlo simulation using a Glauber model for the colliding
nuclei is tuned to reproduce the spectrum in the ZNs and provides a relation
between the measurable longitudinal asymmetry and the shift in the rapidity
($y_{\mathrm{0}}$) of the participant zone formed by the unequal number of
participating nucleons. The dependence of the coefficient of the linear term in
the polynomial expansion, $c_{\rm 1}$, on the mean value of $y_{\mathrm{0}}$ is

forcing. In these systems the forcing parameter is not only time-varying but
also known to have a periodic structure. We present an approach to estimating
periodic, time-varying parameters that imposes periodic structure by treating
the time-varying parameter as a piecewise function with unknown coefficients.
This method allows the resulting parameter estimate more flexibility in shape
than prescribing a specific functional form (e.g., sinusoidal) to model its
behavior, while still maintaining periodicity. We employ nonlinear filtering,
more specifically, a version of the augmented ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), to
estimate the unknown coefficients comprising the piecewise approximation of the
periodic, time-varying parameter. This allows for straightforward comparison of
the proposed method with an EnKF-based parameter tracking algorithm, where
periodicity is not guaranteed.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two biological
examples: a synthetic example with data generated from the nonlinear
FitzHugh-Nagumo system, modeling the excitability of a nerve cell, to estimate
the external voltage parameter, and a case study using reported measles
incidence data from three locations during the pre-vaccine era to estimate the
seasonal transmission parameter. The formulation of the proposed approach also
allows for simultaneous estimation of initial conditions and other static
system parameters, such as the reporting probability of measles cases, which is
vital for predicting under-reported incidence data.

represents a significant advancement in this technology, and in this work we
apply it for the first time to a high-sensitivity search for a
lepton-number--violating process: $^{130}$Te neutrinoless double-beta decay.
Examining a total TeO$_2$ exposure of 86.3 kg$\cdot$yr, characterized by an
effective energy resolution of (7.7 $\pm$ 0.5) keV FWHM and a background in the
region of interest of (0.014 $\pm$ 0.002) counts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr), we
find no evidence for neutrinoless double-beta decay. The median statistical
sensitivity of this search is $7.0\times10^{24}$ yr. Including systematic
uncertainties, we place a lower limit on the decay half-life of
$T^{0\nu}_{1/2}$($^{130}$Te) > $1.3\times 10^{25}$ yr (90% C.L.). Combining
this result with those of two earlier experiments, Cuoricino and CUORE-0, we
find $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}$($^{130}$Te) > $1.5\times 10^{25}$ yr (90% C.L.), which is
the most stringent limit to date on this decay. Interpreting this result as a
limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, we find $m_{\beta\beta}<(110 -
520)$ meV, where the range reflects the nuclear matrix element estimates
employed.

quantification (UQ). A challenge associated with the use of UQ is that many
published methods assume that the underlying model is identifiable (e.g. that a
one-to-one mapping exists from the parameter space to the model output). In
this study we present a novel methodology that is used here to calibrate a
lumped-parameter model to left ventricular pressure and volume time series data
sets. Key steps include using (1) literature and available data to determine
nominal parameter values; (2) sensitivity analysis and subset selection to
determine a set of identifiable parameters; (3) optimization to find a point
estimate for identifiable parameters; and (4) frequentist and Bayesian UQ
calculations to assess the predictive capability of the model. Our results show
that it is possible to determine 5 identifiable model parameters that can be
estimated to our experimental data from three rats, and that computed UQ
intervals capture the measurement and model error.

framework ignores computational limitations while searching for optimal
policies, essentially assuming that the acting agent is perfectly rational and
aims for exact optimality. Using the free-energy, a variational principle is
introduced that accounts not only for the value of a policy alone, but also
considers the cost of finding this optimal policy. The solution of the
variational equations arising from this formulation can be obtained using
familiar Bellman-like value iterations from dynamic programming (DP) and the
Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm from rate distortion theory. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of the approach for generating hierarchies of state

resources. A numerical example showcases these concepts for a path-planning

massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) system with Frequency
Division Duplexing (FDD) operation. Our main objective is to reduce the large
overhead incurred by Downlink (DL) common training and Uplink (UL) feedback
needed to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Our
proposed scheme relies on the fact that the underlying angular distribution of
a channel vector, also known as the angular scattering function, is a
frequency-invariant entity yielding a UL-DL reciprocity and has a limited
angular support. We estimate this support from UL CSI and interpolate it to
obtain the corresponding angular support of the DL channel. Finally we exploit
the estimated support of the DL channel of all the users to design an efficient
channel probing and feedback scheme that maximizes the total spectral
efficiency of the system. Our method is different from the existing
compressed-sensing (CS) based techniques in the literature. Using support
information helps reduce the feedback overhead from O(s*log M) in CS techniques
to O(s) in our proposed method, with $s$ and $M$ being sparsity order of the
channel vectors and the number of base station antennas, respectively.
Furthermore, in order to control the channel sparsity and therefore the DL
common training and UL feedback overhead, we introduce the novel concept of
active channel sparsification. In brief, when the fixed pilot dimension is less
than the required amount for reliable channel estimation, we introduce a
pre-beamforming matrix that artificially reduces the effective channel
dimension of each user to be not larger than the DL pilot dimension, while
maximizing both the number of served users and the number of probed angles. We
provide numerical experiments to compare our method with the state-of-the-art
CS technique.

While the full stability analysis for skyrmions in the presence of the RKKY

frustrated exchange coupling (leading to terms with the fourth power of the

dynamical status of its satellite galaxies. Using 9 dark-matter simulations of
halos like the Milky Way (MW), we find that the present-day substructures in
each halo follow a characteristic distribution in the phase space of orbital
binding energy and angular momentum, and that this distribution is similar from
halo to halo but has an intrinsic dependence on the halo formation history. We
construct this distribution directly from the simulations for a specific halo
and extend the result to halos of similar formation history but different
masses by scaling. The mass of an observed halo can then be estimated by
maximizing the likelihood in comparing the measured kinematic parameters of its
satellite galaxies with these distributions. We test the validity and accuracy
of this method with mock samples taken from the simulations. Using the
positions, radial velocities, and proper motions of 9 tracers and assuming
observational uncertainties comparable to those of MW satellite galaxies, we
find that the halo mass can be recovered to within $\sim$40%. The accuracy can
be improved to within $\sim$25% if 30 tracers are used. However, the dependence
of the phase-space distribution on the halo formation history sets a minimum
uncertainty of $\sim$20% that cannot be reduced by using more tracers. We
believe that this minimum uncertainty also applies to any mass determination
for a halo when the phase space information of other kinematic tracers is used.

""Predict, then Optimize"" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization
problem structure, i.e., its objective and constraints, for designing better
prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function
which measures the decision error induced by a prediction.
  Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally
challenging, and thus we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss
function which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+
loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild
conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex,

experiments on shortest path and portfolio optimization problems show that the
SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the

with linear atom-phonon interactions, valid in the weak coupling regime. A
perturbative expansion of the adsorption rate in the atom-phonon coupling is
infrared divergent at zero temperature, and this infrared problem is
exacerbated by finite temperature. The use of a coherent state phonon basis in
the calculation, however, yields infrared-finite results even at finite
temperature. The sticking probability with the emission of any finite number of
phonons is explicitly seen to be exponentially small, and it vanishes as the
membrane size grows, a result that was previously found at zero temperature; in
contrast to the zero temperature case, this exponential suppression of the
sticking probability persists even with the emission of an infinite number of
soft phonons. Explicit closed-form expressions are obtained for the effects of
soft-phonon emission at finite temperature on the adsorption rate. For slowly
moving atoms, the model predicts that there is zero probability of sticking to
a large elastic membrane at nonzero temperature and weak coupling.

in Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffer from slow learning speed especially in
the early learning trials. This paper introduces a model-based method in
discrete state-spaces for increasing learning speed in terms of required
experience (but not required computational time) by exploiting generalization
in the experiences of the subspaces. A subspace is formed by choosing a subset
of features in the original state representation (full-space). Generalization
and faster learning in a subspace are due to many-to-one mapping of experiences
from the full-space to each state in the subspace. Nevertheless, due to
inherent perceptual aliasing in the subspaces, the policy suggested by each
subspace does not generally converge to the optimal policy. Our approach,
called Model Based Learning with Subspaces (MoBLeS), calculates confidence
intervals of the estimated Q-values in the full-space and in the subspaces.
These confidence intervals are used in the decision making, such that the agent
benefits the most from the possible generalization while avoiding from
detriment of the perceptual aliasing in the subspaces. Convergence of MoBLeS to
the optimal policy is theoretically investigated. Additionally, we show through
several experiments that MoBLeS improves the learning speed in the early
trials.

challenging to extract novel understanding by identifying when theory and

existence has been recently observed in superfluids based on quantum gases too.
In this review we briefly summarize the main results obtained on the
investigation of phase slips from superconductors to quantum gases. In
particular we focus our attention on recent experimental results of the
dissipation in one-dimensional Bose superfluids flowing along a shallow
periodic potential, which show signatures of quantum phase slips.

the clearest evidence of the fact that the Standard Model of fundamental
interactions needs to be modified. Some of the most popular theories that try
to asses this issue postulate the existence of new heavy right-handed
neutrinos, with masses in the energy range that the LHC experiment is currently
exploring. In this thesis, we study the connection between the possible
existence of these neutrinos and charged lepton flavor changing physics. We
consider the inverse seesaw model as a particular realization of a low scale
seesaw model and analyze its lepton flavor violating phenomenology, in
particular the Higgs and Z boson decays to two charged leptons of different
flavor. Moreover, we also explore the possibility of having new exotic lepton

Locking Value (PLV) and re-formulated it in a highly computational efficient
way. Besides, this formulation stresses its strong similarity with coherence,
which we used to introduce two new metrics insensitive to zero lag
synchronization, the imaginary part of PLV (iPLV) and its corrected counterpart
(ciPLV). The new implementation of PLV avoids some highly CPU-expensive
operations, and achieved a 100-fold speedup over the original algorithm. The
new derived metrics were highly robust in the presence of volume conduction.
ciPLV, in particular, proved capable of ignoring zero-lag connectivity, while
correctly estimating nonzero-lag connectivity. Our implementation of PLV makes
it possible to calculate whole-brain connectivity in much shorter times. The
results of the simulations using ciPLV suggest that this metric is ideal to
measure synchronization in the presence of volume conduction or source leakage

natural language processing (NLP) has demonstrated how transfer and multitask
learning can be used to cope with scarcity of annotated data for text modeling.
  The contribution of this work is to show that appraisal theory can be
combined with NLP for mutual benefit. First, fine-grained emotion prediction
can be improved to human-level performance by using NLP representations in
addition to appraisal features. Second, using the appraisal features as
auxiliary targets during training can improve predictions even when only text

hinges on the pivot underpinning the construction of the confidence interval
and the test statistic being asymptotically standard Normal, which is known to
happen if the two samples are independent and the ratio of the sample sizes
converges to a finite positive number. This restriction on the asymptotic
behavior of the ratio of the sample sizes carries the risk of rendering the
asymptotic justification of the finite sample approximation invalid. It turns
out that neither the restriction on the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of the
sample sizes nor the assumption of cross sample independence is necessary for
the pivotal convergence in question to take place. If the joint distribution of
the standardized sample means converges to a spherically symmetric
distribution, then that distribution must be bivariate standard Normal (which
can happen without the assumption of cross sample independence), and the
aforesaid pivotal convergence holds.

their climates and therefore their habitability. Kepler-62f is a 1.4 R$_\oplus$
planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its K2 dwarf host star (Borucki et
al. 2013). We perform N-body simulations that monitor the evolution of
obliquity of Kepler-62f for 10 million year timescales to explore the effects
on model assumptions, such as the masses of the Kepler-62 planets and the
possibility of outer bodies. Significant obliquity variation occurs when the
rotational precession frequency overlaps with one or more of the secular
orbital frequencies, but most variations are limited to $\lesssim$10$^\circ$.
Moderate variations ($\sim$10$^\circ - 20^\circ$) can occur over a broader
range of initial obliquities when the relative nodal longitude ($\Delta\Omega$)
overlaps with the frequency and phase of a given secular mode. However, we find
that adding outer gas giants on long period orbits ($\gtrsim$ 1000 days) can
produce large ($\sim$60$^\circ$) variations in obliquity if Kepler-62f has a
very rapid (4 hr) rotation period. The possibility of giant planets on long
period orbits impacts the climate and habitability of Kepler-62f through
variations in the latitudinal surface flux, where the timescale for large
variation can occur on million year timescales.

never looks beyond the direct neighbors of the current node and does not store

that when routing on any triangulation $T$ of $P$ such that $S\subseteq T$, no

to perform experiment design for MR fingerprinting. Specifically, we describe a
discrete-time dynamic system to model spin dynamics, and derive an
estimation-theoretic bound, i.e., the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), to characterize
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency of an MR fingerprinting experiment.
We then formulate an optimal experiment design problem, which determines a
sequence of acquisition parameters to encode MR tissue parameters with the
maximal SNR efficiency, while respecting the physical constraints and other
constraints from the image decoding/reconstruction process. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed approach with numerical simulations, phantom
experiments, and in vivo experiments. We demonstrate that the optimized
experiments substantially reduce data acquisition time and/or improve parameter
estimation. For example, the optimized experiments achieve about a factor of
two improvement in the accuracy of $T_2$ maps, while keeping similar or
slightly better accuracy of $T_1$ maps. Finally, as a remarkable observation,
we find that the sequence of optimized acquisition parameters appears to be
highly structured rather than randomly/pseudo-randomly varying as is prescribed

to each continued fraction a snake graph, and hence a cluster variable in a

obtain a direct formula for the Jones polynomial of a 2-bridge link as the
numerator of a continued fraction of Laurent polynomials in $q=-t^{-1}$. We
also obtain formulas for the degree and the width of the Jones polynomial, as
well as for the first three and the last three coefficients. Along the way, we
also develop some basic facts about even continued fractions and construct

consider a mode selection scheme based on the maximum received signal strength

interference. Specifically, a UE will operate in a cellular mode, only if its
received signal strength from the strongest base station (BS) is larger than a
threshold beta; otherwise, the UE will operate in a D2D mode. Furthermore, we
analyze the performance in terms of the coverage probability and the area
spectral efficiency (ASE) for both the cellular network and the D2D one.
Analytical results are obtained and the accuracy of the proposed analytical
framework is validated through Monte Carol simulations. Through our theoretical

search in the well-known actor-critic algorithm and show the convergence using
ODE method. We tested this algorithm on a scheduling problem. Here an incoming
job is scheduled into one of the four queues based on the queue lengths. We see
from experimental results that algorithm using Nesterov's acceleration has
significantly better performance compared to algorithm which do not use

  Expansion",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of uncertainties are inevitable in engineering design and
analysis, where failure in understanding their effects might lead to the
structural or functional failure of the systems. The role of global sensitivity
analysis in this aspect is to quantify and rank the effects of input random
variables and their combinations to the variance of the random output. In
problems where the use of expensive computer simulations are required,
metamodels are widely used to speed up the process of global sensitivity
analysis. In this paper, a multi-fidelity framework for global sensitivity
analysis using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is presented. The goal is to
accelerate the computation of Sobol sensitivity indices when the deterministic
simulation is expensive and simulations with multiple levels of fidelity are
available. This is especially useful in cases where a partial differential
equation solver computer code is utilized to solve engineering problems. The
multi-fidelity PCE is constructed by combining the low-fidelity and correction
PCE. Following this step, the Sobol indices are computed using this combined
PCE. The PCE coefficients for both low-fidelity and correction PCE are computed
with spectral projection technique and sparse grid integration. In order to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed method for sensitivity analysis,
several simulations are conducted. On the aerodynamic example, the
multi-fidelity approach is able to obtain an accurate value of Sobol indices
with 36.66% computational cost compared to the standard single-fidelity PCE for
a nearly similar accuracy.

from observational studies. A popular approach is to estimate propensity scores
by maximum likelihood based on logistic regression, and then apply inverse
probability weighted estimators or extensions to estimate treatment effects.
However, a challenging issue is that such inverse probability weighting methods
including doubly robust methods can perform poorly even when the logistic model
appears adequate as examined by conventional techniques. In addition, there is
increasing difficulty to appropriately estimate propensity scores when dealing
with a large number of covariates. To address these issues, we study calibrated
estimation as an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation for fitting
logistic propensity score models. We show that, with possible model
misspecification, minimizing the expected calibration loss underlying the
calibrated estimators involves reducing both the expected likelihood loss and a
measure of relative errors which controls the mean squared errors of inverse
probability weighted estimators. Furthermore, we propose a regularized
calibrated estimator by minimizing the calibration loss with a Lasso penalty.
We develop a novel Fisher scoring descent algorithm for computing the proposed
estimator, and provide a high-dimensional analysis of the resulting inverse
probability weighted estimators of population means, leveraging the control of
relative errors for calibrated estimation. We present a simulation study and an
empirical application to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods
compared with maximum likelihood and regularization.

the task of estimating the 3D structure of a molecule from a set of noisy 2D
projections, taken from unknown viewing directions. Many algorithms for SPR
start from an initial reference molecule, and alternate between refining the
estimated viewing angles given the molecule, and refining the molecule given
the viewing angles. This scheme is called iterative refinement. Reliance on an
initial, user-chosen reference introduces model bias, and poor initialization
can lead to slow convergence. Furthermore, since no ground truth is available
for an unsolved molecule, it is difficult to validate the obtained results.
This creates the need for high quality ab initio models that can be quickly
obtained from experimental data with minimal priors, and which can also be used
for validation. We propose a procedure to obtain such an ab initio model
directly from raw data using Kam's autocorrelation method. Kam's method has
been known since 1980, but it leads to an underdetermined system, with missing
orthogonal matrices. Until now, this system has been solved only for special
cases, such as highly symmetric molecules or molecules for which a homologous
structure was already available. In this paper, we show that knowledge of just
two clean projections is sufficient to guarantee a unique solution to the
system. This system is solved by an optimization-based heuristic. For the first
time, we are then able to obtain a low-resolution ab initio model of an
asymmetric molecule directly from raw data, without 2D class averaging and
without tilting. Numerical results are presented on both synthetic and

successfully reveal opening of previously closed magnetic field lines with a
rather inclined/low-lying jet structure. The peak phase of the jet emission is
followed by the development of a two-ribbon flare that shows coronal loop

that the jet activity likely triggered the two-ribbon flare by perturbing the

revealed two types of the UFs as background and local. The background UFs
associated with random increasing of separate parts of wave fronts. These UFs
are seen as weak and diffuse details that ride the wave fronts without stable
shapes and localization in space. The local UFs sources mainly localize near to
the footpoint of magnetic loops, anchored in an umbra, along which the
propagation of three-minute waves was observed. It is shown that the maxima of
three-minute oscillation trains coincide with the peak intensity of UFs. The
sunspot three-minute wave dynamics showed a relation between the localization
of oscillations power peak at the coronal magnetic loop footpoints and the UFs
origin. The spatial structure of the UFs sources, their power, and lifetime are
determined by the cut-off frequency of the waves for the detected waveguides.
We concluded that UFs are a global process of short-time increase of the wave
activity.

conversely, quantum information theory could be seen in Heisenbergian terms.
The article takes advantage of the circumstance that any instance of quantum
information is a ""structure""--an organization of elements, ultimately bits, of
classical information, manifested in measuring instruments. While, however,
this organization can, along with the observed behavior of measuring
instruments, be described by means of classical physics, it cannot be predicted
by means of classical physics, but only, probabilistically or statistically, by
means of quantum mechanics, or in high-energy physics, by means of quantum
field theory (or possibly some alternative theories within each scope). By

the present view, be described by either classical or quantum theory, or
possibly by any other means, which leads to the concept of ""structure without

from this perspective, some recent work in quantum information theory.

emerged just before them from $s$, until they arrive at the destination point
$t$. Such pursuits have been investigated before in the continuous setting and
in discrete time when the underlying environment is a regular grid. In both
these settings the agents' walks provably converge to a shortest path from $s$
to $t$. Furthermore, assuming a certain natural probability distribution over
the move choices of the agents on the grid (in case there are multiple shortest
paths between an agent and its predecessor), the walks converge to the uniform
distribution over all shortest paths from $s$ to $t$.
  We study the evolution of agent walks over a general finite graph environment
$G$. Our model is a natural generalization of the pursuit rule proposed for the
case of the grid. The main results are as follows. We show that ""convergence""
to the shortest paths in the sense of previous work extends to all
pseudo-modular graphs (i.e. graphs in which every three pairwise intersecting
disks have a nonempty intersection), and also to environments obtained by
taking graph products, generalizing previous results in two different ways. We
show that convergence to the shortest paths is also obtained by chordal graphs,
and discuss some further positive and negative results for planar graphs. In
the most general case, convergence to the shortest paths is not guaranteed, and
the agents may get stuck on sets of recurrent, non-optimal walks from $s$ to
$t$. However, we show that the limiting distributions of the agents' walks will
always be uniform distributions over some set of walks of equal length.

we exhaustively detected peaks as significant velocity components with the
radial velocity on a 0.1 km/s scale. This analysis result shows that the radial
velocity of red-shifted and blue-shifted components exhibits a change between
acceleration and deceleration on the time scale of a few hundred days. These
velocity variations are likely to correlate with the intensity variations, in
particular during flaring state of H$_2$O masers. It seems reasonable to
consider that the velocity variation of the maser source is caused by the shock
propagation in the envelope due to stellar pulsation. However, it is difficult

the mechanisms underlying the extreme mobility enhancement remain elusive.
Herein, we used 18O isotope exchanged SrTi18O3 as substrates to create 2DEG at
room temperature with and without the LSMO buffer layer. By mapping the oxygen
profile across the interface between STO18 and disordered LaAlO3 or
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), we provide unambiguous evidence that redox
reactions occur at oxide interfaces even grown at room temperature. Moreover,
the manganite buffer layer not only suppresses the carrier density but also
strongly suppresses the oxygen exchange dynamics of the STO substrate, which
likely prevents the reduction of STO during the formation of the 2DEG. The
underlying mechanism on the enhanced electron mobility at buffered oxide
interfaces is also discussed.

and establishes a bijective order reversing correspondence between the
intermediate fields and the subgroups of a group of permutations called the
Galois group of the extension. It has been the dream of many mathematicians at
the end of the nineteenth century to generalize these results to systems of
algebraic partial differential (PD) equations and the corresponding finitely
generated differential extensions, in order to be able to add the word
differential in front of any classical statement. The achievement of the
Picard-Vessiot theory by E. Kolchin between 1950 and 1970 is now well known.
The purpose of this paper is to sketch the general theory for such differential
extensions and algebraic pseudogroups by means of new methods mixing
differential algebra, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. As already
discovered by E. Vessiot in 1904 through the use of automorphic systems, a
concept never acknowledged, the main point is to notice that the Galois theory
(old and new) is mainly a study of principal homogeneous spaces (PHS) for
algebraic groups or pseudogroups. Hence, all the formal theory of PD equations
developped by D.C. Spencer around 1970 must be used together with modern
algebraic geometry, in particular tensor products of rings and fields. However,
the combination of these new tools is not sufficient and we have to create the
analogue for Lie pseudogroups of the so-called invariant derivations introduced
by A. Bialynicki-Birula after 1960 in the study of algebraic groups and fields
with derivations. We shall finally prove the usefulness of the resulting
differential Galois theory through striking applications to mechanics,
revisiting shell theory, chain theory, the Frenet-Serret formulas and the
integration of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

prior on the patches of natural images. Although it is very effective for
restoring images, its high runtime complexity makes EPLL ill-suited for most
practical applications. In this paper, we propose three approximations to the

incurring a negligible drop in the restored image quality (less than 0.5 dB).
We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our algorithm on a number of

logs' 3D scans as input, simulators perform a real-time job to predict the
lumbers. These simulators, however, tend to be slow at processing large volume
of wood. We thus explore an alternative approximation techniques based on the
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to identify the already processed log
to which an unseen log resembles the most. The main benefit of the ICP approach
is that it can easily handle 3D scans with a variable number of points. We
compare this ICP-based nearest neighbor predictor, to predictors built using
machine learning algorithms such as the K-nearest-neighbor (kNN) and Random
Forest (RF). The implemented ICP-based predictor enabled us to identify key
points in using the 3D scans directly for distance calculation. The long-term
goal of this ongoing research is to integrated ICP distance calculations and
machine learning.

2-(4-styrylphenyl)benzoxazole as a wavelength shifter. To date, the chemical
compound has not been used as scintillator additive. A role of wavelength
shifter is to shift the scintillation spectrum towards longer wavelengths
making it more suitable for applications in scintillators of long strips
geometry because of larger attenuation length, and light detection with digital
silicon photomultipliers. In the thesis method of scintillators development and
characterization of their properties are presented as well as synthesis method
of the novel wavelength shifter. The optimal concentration of the novel
wavelength shifter was established by maximizing the light output. Performance
of scintillator, considering light emission spectrum, light emission
efficiency, rising and decay times of the scintillation pulses were analyzed
and compared to state of the art commercially available plastic scintillators.

more comprehensive study of the linear stability of planar simple shearing and
pure shearing flows, with account taken of convective Kelvin wave-vector
stretching by the base flow. We provide a closed form solution for the linear
stability problem and show that wave-vector stretching leads to asymptotic
stabilization of the non-convective instability found by Barker et al. We also
explore the stabilizing effects of higher velocity gradients achieved by an
enhanced-continuum model based on a dissipative analog of the van der
Waals-Cahn-Hilliard equation of equilibrium thermodynamics. This model involves
a dissipative hyper-stress, as the analog of a special Korteweg stress, with
surface viscosity representing the counterpart of elastic surface tension.
Based on the enhanced continuum model, we also present a model of steady shear
bands and their non-linear stability against parallel shearing. Finally, we
propose a theoretical connection between the non-convective instability of
Barker et al. and the loss of generalized ellipticity in the quasi-static field
equations. Apart from the theoretical interest, the present work may suggest
stratagems for the numerical simulation of continuum field equations involving

introduce SubMatrix Selection SingularValue Decomposition (SMSSVD), a
parameter-free unsupervised signal decomposition and dimension reduction
method, designed to reduce noise, adaptively for each low-rank-signal in a
given data matrix, and represent the signals in the data in a way that enable
unbiased exploratory analysis and reconstruction of multiple overlaid signals,
including identifying groups of variables that drive different signals.
  The Submatrix Selection Singular Value Decomposition (SMSSVD) method produces
a denoised signal decomposition from a given data matrix. The SMSSVD method
guarantees orthogonality between signal components in a straightforward manner
and it is designed to make automation possible. We illustrate SMSSVD by
applying it to several real and synthetic datasets and compare its performance
to golden standard methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and SPC
(Sparse Principal Components, using Lasso constraints). The SMSSVD is
computationally efficient and despite being a parameter-free method, in
general, outperforms existing statistical learning methods.

variations of significant amplitude (Delta R > 5 mag) whose physical origin has
been ascribed to both extinction (UXor-type) and accretion (EXor-type)
variability, although their mutual proportion has not been clarified yet.
Recently, V2492 Cyg has reached a level of brightness ever registered in the
period of its documented activity. Optical and near-infrared photometry and
spectroscopy have been obtained in October 2016 and between March and July
2017. The source has remained bright until the end of May 2017, then it started
to rapidly fade since the beginning of June at a rate of about 0.08 mag/day. On
mid-July 2017 the source has reached the same low-brightness level as two years
before. Extinction and mass accretion rate were derived by means of the
luminosity of the brightest lines, in particular Halpha and Hbeta. A couple of
optical high-resolution spectra are also presented to derive information on the
gas kinematics. Visual extinction variations do not exceed a few magnitudes,
while the mass accretion rate is estimated to vary from less than 10^-8 up to a
few 10^-7 M_sun/yr. This latter is comparable to that estimated on the previous
high-state in 2010, likely occurred under more severe extinction conditions.
The combined analysis of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations
extends to the present event the original suggestion that the V2492 Cyg
variability is a combination of changing extinction and accretion.

detected as millisecond radio pulses with very high dispersion measures. As new
radio surveys begin searching for FRBs a large population is expected to be
detected in real-time, triggering a range of multi-wavelength and
multi-messenger telescopes to search for repeating bursts and/or associated
emission. Here we propose a method for disseminating FRB triggers using Virtual
Observatory Events (VOEvents). This format was developed and is used
successfully for transient alerts across the electromagnetic spectrum and for
multi-messenger signals such as gravitational waves. In this paper we outline a
proposed VOEvent standard for FRBs that includes the essential parameters of
the event and where these parameters should be specified within the structure
of the event. An additional advantage to the use of VOEvents for FRBs is that
the events can automatically be ingested into the FRB Catalogue (FRBCAT)
enabling real-time updates for public use. We welcome feedback from the
community on the proposed standard outlined below and encourage those
interested to join the nascent working group forming around this topic.

flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However some high-energy solar events
do not result in SEPs being detected at Earth, and it is these types of event
which may be termed ""false alarms"".
  We define two simple SEP forecasting algorithms based upon the occurrence of
a magnetically well-connected CME with a speed in excess of 1500 km/s (""a fast
CME"") or a well-connected X-class flare and analyse them with respect to
historical data sets. We compare the parameters of those solar events which
produced an enhancement of >40 MeV protons at Earth (""an SEP event"") and the
false alarms. We find that an SEP forecasting algorithm based solely upon the
occurrence of a well-connected fast CME produces fewer false alarms (28.8%)
than one based solely upon a well-connected X-class flare (50.6%). Both
algorithms fail to forecast a relatively high percentage of SEP events (53.2%
and 50.6% respectively). Our analysis of the historical data sets shows that
false alarm X-class flares were either not associated with any CME, or were
associated with a CME slower than 500 km/s; false alarm fast CMEs tended to be
associated with flares of class less than M3.
  A better approach to forecasting would be an algorithm which takes as its
base the occurrence of both CMEs and flares. We define a new forecasting
algorithm which uses a combination of CME and flare parameters and show that
the false alarm ratio is similar to that for the algorithm based upon fast CMEs
(29.6%), but the percentage of SEP events not forecast is reduced to 32.4%.
Lists of the solar events which gave rise to >40 MeV protons and the false
alarms have been derived and are made available to aid further study.

problems in theoretical computer science. This problem is NP-complete in

linear gates. We go outside Boolean realm and consider circuits built of any
fixed set of gates on an arbitrary large finite domain. From the complexity
point of view this is strictly connected with the problems of solving equations
(or systems of equations) over finite algebras.
  The research reported in this work was motivated by a desire to know for
which finite algebras $\mathbf A$ there is a polynomial time algorithm that
decides if an equation over $\mathbf A$ has a solution. We are also looking for
polynomial time algorithms that decide if two circuits over a finite algebra
compute the same function. Although we have not managed to solve these problems
in the most general setting we have obtained such a characterization for a very
broad class of algebras from congruence modular varieties. This class includes
most known and well-studied algebras such as groups, rings, modules (and their
generalizations like quasigroups, loops, near-rings, nonassociative rings, Lie
algebras), lattices (and their extensions like Boolean algebras, Heyting
algebras or other algebras connected with multi-valued logics including
MV-algebras).
  This paper seems to be the first systematic study of the computational
complexity of satisfiability of non-Boolean circuits and solving equations over
finite algebras. The characterization results provided by the paper is given in
terms of nice structural properties of algebras for which the problems are
solvable in polynomial time.

systematic design addresses the choice of network size and regularization of
parameters. The number of nodes and layers in network increases in progression
with the objective of consistently reducing an appropriate cost. Each layer is
optimized at a time, where appropriate parameters are learned using convex
optimization. Regularization parameters for convex optimization do not need a
significant manual effort for tuning. We also use random instances for some
weight matrices, and that helps to reduce the number of parameters we learn.
The developed network is expected to show good generalization power due to
appropriate regularization and use of random weights in the layers. This
expectation is verified by extensive experiments for classification and

global form to finite-domain formulation then to minimum-domain form, and from

minimum-domain impulse theory raises the finding of Li and Lu (J. Fluid Mech.,
712: 598-613, 2012) to a theorem: The entire force with discrete wake is
completely determined by only the time rate of impulse of those vortical
structures still connecting to the body, along with the Lamb-vector integral
thereof that captures the contribution of all the rest disconnected vortical
structures. For compressible flow, we find that the global form in terms of the
curl of momentum, obtained by Huang (Unsteady Vortical Aerodynamics. Shanghai
Jiaotong Univ. Press, 1994), can be generalized to having arbitrary finite
domain, but the formula is cumbersome and in general the curl of momentum no
longer has discrete structure and hence no minimum-domain theory exists.
Nevertheless, as the measure of transverse process only, the unsteady field of
vorticity may still have discrete wake. This leads to a minimum-domain
compressible vorticity-moment theory in terms of density-weighted vorticity
(but it is beyond the classic concept of impulse). These new findings and
applications have been confirmed by our numerical experiments. The results not
only open an avenue to combine the theory with computation-experiment in wide
applications, but also reveals a physical truth that it is no longer necessary
to account for all wake vortical structures in computing the force and moment.

from columnar nanocrystalline to amorphous-like. The CTE of all the coatings is
higher than the one of the corresponding bulk W form. In particular, as the
grain size shrinks, the CTE increases from 5.1 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ for
nanocrystalline W to 6.6 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ in the ultra-nano-crystalline

Many image correlation techniques have been developed for different

to a manually selected region of analysis where it is assumed that the observed
molecules have homogeneous and constant behavior over time. Due to the spatial
and temporal complexity of biological objects, this assumption is frequently at
fault. It is then necessary to propose a robust method for discriminating the
different behaviors over time from experience, as well as identification of the
type of dynamics (diffusion or flow). This paper presents an original system of
automatic discrimination and identification of spatially and temporally uniform
regions for the analysis of molecular different dynamics over time by
calculating STICS (Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy) at different
time lags. An evaluation of system performance is presented on simulated images
and images acquired by fluorescence microscopy on actin cytoskeleton.

(time-averaged Reynolds number is $Re_i = 5 \times 10^5$). Using particle image
velocimetry (PIV), we measure the velocity over a wide range of modulation
periods, corresponding to a change in Womersley number in the range $15 \leq Wo
\leq 114$. To understand how the flow responds to a given modulation, we
calculate the phase delay and amplitude response of the azimuthal velocity.
  In agreement with earlier theoretical and numerical work, we find that for
large modulation periods the system follows the given modulation of the
driving, i.e. the system behaves quasi-stationary. For smaller modulation
periods, the flow cannot follow the modulation, and the flow velocity responds
with a phase delay and a smaller amplitude response to the given modulation. If
we compare our results with numerical and theoretical results for the laminar
case, we find that the scalings of the phase delay and the amplitude response
are similar. However, the local response in the bulk of the flow is independent
of the distance to the modulated boundary. Apparently, the turbulent mixing is
strong enough to prevent the flow from having radius-dependent responses to the
given modulation.

electronic structure by oxidation or corrosion processes. A detailed knowledge
- or even control of - the surface structure is highly desirable, as it impacts
the performance of opto-electronic devices from gas-sensing to energy
conversion applications. It is also a prerequisite for density functional
theory-based modelling of the electronic structure in contact with an

contact with gas-phase water, as it undergoes a surface reordering, but does
not oxidise. We investigate the underlying changes of the surface in contact
with water by means of theoretically derived reflection anisotropy spectroscopy
(RAS). A comparison of our results with experiment reveals that a water-induced

from experiment, reproducing the optical spectra. We discuss potential reaction

experimental signatures - is feasible for GaP in contact with water double

counterpart to the hot spot, WISE J051926.26-454554.1, is listed in the AllWISE
source catalog. The source was detected in all the four WISE photometric bands.
A comparison between the WISE and radio images reinforces the physical
association of the \wise\ source to the hot spot. The WISE flux density of the
source was carefully evaluated. A close investigation of the multi-wavelength
synchrotron spectral energy distribution from the object reveals a mid-infrared
excess at the wavelength of $\lambda=22$ $\mu$m with a statistical significance
of $4.8 \sigma$ over the simple power-law extrapolation from the synchrotron
radio spectrum. The excess is reinforced by single and double cutoff power-law
modeling of the radio-to-optical spectral energy distribution. The synchrotron
cutoff frequency of the main and excess components was evaluated as $7.1 \times
10^{14}$ Hz and $5.5 \times 10^{13}$ Hz, respectively. From the cutoff
frequency, the magnetic field of the emission region was constrained as a
function of the region size. In order to interpret the excess component, an
electron population different from the main one dominating the observed radio
spectrum is necessary. The excess emission is proposed to originate in a sub
structure within the hot spot, in which the magnetic field is by a factor of a
few stronger than that in the minimum energy condition. The relation of the
mid-infrared excess to the X-ray emission is briefly discussed.

in the $SR$-algorithm (which is a $QR$-like algorithm), structure-preserving,
for computing eigenvalues and vectors, for a class of structured matrices.
  This reduction may be handled via the algorithm JHESS or via the recent
algorithm JHMSH and its variants.
  The main drawback of JHESS (or JHMSH) is that it may suffer from a fatal
breakdown, causing a brutal stop of the computations and hence, the
$SR$-algorithm does not run. JHESS may also encounter near-breakdowns, source
of serious numerical instability.
  In this paper, we focus on these aspects. We first bring light on the
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the $SR$-decomposition,
which is intimately linked to $J$-Hessenberg reduction. Then we will derive a
strategy for curing fatal breakdowns and also for treating near breakdowns.
Hence, the $J$-Hessenberg form may be obtained.
  Numerical experiments are given, demonstrating the efficiency of our
strategies to cure and treat breakdowns or near breakdowns.

possibility of varying this transition temperature into a same giant

temperature of iron rhodium thin films can be tuned by the bombardment of ions
of Ne 5+ with varying fluences up to 10 14 ions cm --2 , leading to optimal
refrigeration over a large 270--380 K temperature window. The Tc modification
is found to be due to the ion-induced disorder and to the density of new

spectra, and electric transition rates in eight neutron-rich isotopic chains --
Ra, Th, U, Pu, Cm, Cf, Fm, and No -- are systematically analyzed using a
quadrupole-octupole collective Hamiltonian model, with parameters determined by
constrained reflection-asymmetric and axially-symmetric relativistic mean-field
calculations based on the PC-PK1 energy density functional. The theoretical
results of low-lying negative-parity bands, odd-even staggering, average
octupole deformations $\langle\beta_3\rangle$, and $B(E3; 3^-_1\to 0^+_1)$ show
evidence of a shape transition from nearly spherical to stable
octupole-deformed, and finally octupole-soft equilibrium shapes in the
neutron-rich actinides. A microscopic mechanism for the onset of stable
octupole deformation is also discussed in terms of the evolution of
single-nucleon orbitals with deformation.

Interestingly, the split of Fermi surfaces induced by the nonsymmetric

the angle-dependent SdH oscillation illustrates the contribution of each Fermi
surface to the conductivity. The electronic structure revealed by

object-centric camera pose estimation and wide baseline feature matching. Our
method is based upon the premise that by providing supervision over a set of

shows traits of abstraction abilities (e.g., cross-modality pose estimation).
In the context of the core supervised tasks, we demonstrate our representation
achieves state-of-the-art wide baseline feature matching results without
requiring apriori rectification (unlike SIFT and the majority of learned
features). We also show 6DOF camera pose estimation given a pair local image
patches. The accuracy of both supervised tasks come comparable to humans.
Finally, we contribute a large-scale dataset composed of object-centric street

conclude with a discussion on the learned representation and open research

terms of limits in the most 'model-independent' fashion possible. In this
article we provide an analytic parametrization of the {\it differential}
Higgs-pair production at the LHC in the effective field theory (EFT) extension
of the SM. It results from a fit to the theory prediction for the $gg \to hh$
cross section at the 13\,TeV at the LHC. Subsequently the resulting formula is
used for a reweighing technique that allows to recast exclusion bounds from
ATLAS and CMS HH$\to\gamma\gamma\,b\bar{b}$ searches to any point of the
considered EFT parameter space. We demonstrate with a fast simulation of the
LHC detectors that with this approach it is possible to cover the continuously
of the EFT parameter space, taking correctly into account the efficiencies of
signal selections, without the necessity of rerunning a large number of full
detector simulations. Finally, the resulting exclusion bounds are confronted to
several explicit models such as setups with additional scalars, including 2HDM,
vector-like fermions, and minimal composite Higgs models, mapped to the EFT.

  Virtual Network Functions","Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing",,"10.1109/TCC.2019.2914387",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides higher flexibility for network
operators and reduces the complexity in network service deployment. Using NFV,
Virtual Network Functions (VNF) can be located in various network nodes and
chained together in a Service Function Chain (SFC) to provide a specific
service. Consolidating multiple VNFs in a smaller number of locations would
allow decreasing capital expenditures. However, excessive consolidation of VNFs
might cause additional latency penalties due to processing-resource sharing,
and this is undesirable, as SFCs are bounded by service-specific latency
requirements. In this paper, we identify two different types of penalties
(referred as ""costs"") related to the processingresource sharing among multiple
VNFs: the context switching costs and the upscaling costs. Context switching
costs arise when multiple CPU processes (e.g., supporting different VNFs) share
the same CPU and thus repeated loading/saving of their context is required.
Upscaling costs are incurred by VNFs requiring multi-core implementations,
since they suffer a penalty due to the load-balancing needs among CPU cores.
These costs affect how the chained VNFs are placed in the network to meet the
performance requirement of the SFCs. We evaluate their impact while considering
SFCs with different bandwidth and latency requirements in a scenario of VNF
consolidation.

simple, out of the box machine learning algorithms to correlate characteristic
electrogram gradients with the displacement of an electrogram recording from a

(second) driver in tissues containing two drivers of atrial fibrillation.
Additionally, we demonstrate how the technique can be applied to tissues with
an arbitrary number of drivers. Extending the technique for use in clinical

strong coupling for zero and non-zero temperature, is demonstrated by solving
the spin-boson model for which we find perfect agreement with other methods,
each one suitable for a special regime of parameters. The challenges arising in
the strong coupling regime are not only reflected in the computational effort
needed for the HOPS method to converge but also in the necessity for an
importance sampling mechanism, accounted for by the non-linear variant of HOPS.
In order to include non-zero temperature effects in the strong coupling regime
we found that it is highly favorable for the HOPS method to use the zero
temperature BCF and include temperature via a stochastic Hermitian contribution
to the system Hamiltonian.

field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric to be reconfigured without
affecting the operations on the rest of the fabric. To use an FPGA as a
dynamically shared compute resource, one could partition and manage an FPGA
fabric as multiple DPR partitions that can be independently reconfigured at
runtime with different application function units (AFUs). Unfortunately,
dividing a fabric into DPR partitions with fixed boundaries causes the
available fabric resources to become fragmented. An AFU of a given size cannot
be loaded unless a sufficiently large DPR partition was floorplanned at build
time. To overcome this inefficiency, we devised an ""amorphous"" DPR technique
that is compatible with current device and tool support but does not require
the DPR partition boundaries to be a priori fixed. A collection of AFU
bitstreams can be simultaneously loaded on the fabric if their footprints (the
actual area used by an AFU) in the fabric do not overlap. We verified the

planets, the eight established plus a hypothetical ""Planet Nine"". Several
recent studies have shown that a planet with a mass of about 10 Earth masses on
a distant eccentric orbit with perihelion far beyond the Kuiper belt could
create and maintain this clustering. The evolutionary path resulting in an
orbit such as the one suggested for Planet Nine is nevertheless not easily
explained. Here we investigate whether a planet scattered away from the
giant-planet region could be lifted to an orbit similar to the one suggested
for Planet Nine through dynamical friction with a cold, distant planetesimal
belt. Recent simulations of planetesimal formation via the streaming
instability suggest that planetesimals can readily form beyond 100au. We
explore this circularisation by dynamical friction with a set of numerical
simulations. We find that a planet that is scattered from the region close to
Neptune onto an eccentric orbit has a 20-30% chance of obtaining an orbit
similar to that of Planet Nine after 4.6Gyr. Our simulations also result in
strong or partial clustering of the planetesimals; however, whether or not this
clustering is observable depends on the location of the inner edge of the
planetesimal belt. If the inner edge is located at 200au the degree of
clustering amongst observable objects is significant.

Therefore, temperature stabilization targets (e.g., 1.5 {\deg}C and 2.0 {\deg}C
of warming above pre-industrial levels, as from the Paris Agreement) have
important implications for coastal flood risk. Here, we assess differences in
the return periods of coastal floods at a global network of tide gauges between
scenarios that stabilize GMST warming at 1.5 {\deg}C, 2.0 {\deg}C, and 2.5
{\deg}C above pre-industrial levels. We employ probabilistic, localized SLR
projections and long-term hourly tide gauge records to construct estimates of
the return levels of current and future flood heights for the 21st and 22nd
centuries. By 2100, under 1.5 {\deg}C, 2.0 {\deg}C, and 2.5 {\deg}C GMST

of 28-82 cm (90% probability), 55 cm (very likely 30-94 cm), and 58 cm (very
likely 36-93 cm), respectively. As an independent comparison, a semi-empirical
sea level model calibrated to temperature and GMSL over the past two millennia
estimates median GMSL will rise within < 13% of these projections. By 2150,
relative to the 2.0 {\deg}C scenario, GMST stabilization of 1.5 {\deg}C
inundates roughly 5 million fewer inhabitants that currently occupy lands,
including 40,000 fewer individuals currently residing in Small Island
Developing States. Relative to a 2.0 {\deg}C scenario, the reduction in the
amplification of the frequency of the 100-yr flood arising from a 1.5 {\deg}C
GMST stabilization is greatest in the eastern United States and in Europe, with
flood frequency amplification being reduced by about half.

images would greatly benefit from a reliable factorization of appearance into
material (i.e., diffuse and specular) and illumination (i.e., environment

results, typically require controlled settings, expensive devices, or
significant manual effort. To the other hand, methods that are automatic and
work on 'in the wild' Internet images, often extract only low-frequency

lighting in an uncontrolled setting. Our key observation is that seeing
multiple instances of the same material under different illumination (i.e.,
environment), and different materials under the same illumination provide
valuable constraints that can be exploited to yield a high-quality solution
(i.e., specular materials and environment illumination) for all the observed
materials and environments. Similar constraints also arise when observing
multiple materials in a single environment, or a single material across
multiple environments. The core of this approach is an optimization procedure
that uses two neural networks that are trained on synthetic images to predict
good gradients in parametric space given observation of reflected light. We
evaluate our method on a range of synthetic and real examples to generate

photo-consistent image manipulation that is otherwise very challenging to

paper presents a new generic and flexible implementation of a software
Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder. A large set of parameters can be
fine-tuned dynamically without re-compiling the software source code: the code
length, the code rate, the frozen bits set, the puncturing patterns, the cyclic
redundancy check, the list size, the type of decoding algorithm, the
tree-pruning strategy and the data quantization. This generic and flexible SCL
decoder enables to explore tradeoffs between throughput, latency and decoding
performance. Several optimizations are proposed to achieve a competitive
decoding speed despite the constraints induced by the genericity and the
flexibility. The resulting polar list decoder is about 4 times faster than a
generic software decoder and only 2 times slower than a non-flexible unrolled
decoder. Thanks to the flexibility of the decoder, the fully adaptive SCL
algorithm can be easily implemented and achieves higher throughput than any
other similar decoder in the literature (up to 425 Mb/s on a single processor

overcome the imaging limitations of the THz domain, compressive imaging in

promising approach especially when used in a single-pixel imaging modality. The

solvable strongly correlated cases, and will study both quantum models, and
classical models which are deterministic in the bulk. The only source of
classical stochasticity in the time-evolution will come from the boundaries of
the system. Physically, these boundaries may be understood as Markovian baths,
which drive the current through the system. The examples studied include the
open XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, the open Hubbard model, and a classical
integrable reversible cellular automaton, namely the Rule 54 of Bobenko {\em et
al}. [Commun. Math. Phys. {\bf 158}, 127 (1993)] with stochastic boundaries.
The quantum NESS can be at least partially understood through the Yang-Baxter
integrability structure of the underlying integrable bulk Hamiltonian, whereas
for the Rule 54 model NESS seems to come from a seemingly unrelated
integrability theory. In both the quantum and the classical case, the
underlying matrix product ansatz defining the NESS also allows for construction
of novel conservation laws of the bulk models themselves. In the classical
case, a modification of the matrix product ansatz also allows for construction
of states beyond the steady state (i.e., some of the decay modes -- Liouvillian
eigenvectors of the model). We hope that this article will help further the
quest to unite different perspectives of integrability of NESS (of both quantum

revenues from battery storage systems installed behind-the-meter. This work
presents an optimized control strategy that allows a battery to be used
simultaneously for self-consumption and primary frequency control. Therein, it
addresses two stochastic problems: the delivery of primary frequency control
with a battery and the use of the battery for self-consumption. We propose a
linear recharging policy to regulate the state of charge of the battery while
providing primary frequency control. Formulating this as a chance-constrained
problem, we can ensure that the risk of battery constraint violations stays
below a predefined probability. We use robust optimization as a safe
approximation to the chance-constraints, which allows to make the risk of
constraint violation arbitrarily low, while keeping the problem tractable and
offering maximum reserve capacity. Simulations with real frequency measurements
prove the effectiveness of the designed recharging strategy. We adopt a
rule-based policy for self-consumption, which is optimized using stochastic
programming. This policy allows to reserve more energy and power of the battery
on moments when expected consumption or production is higher, while using other
moments for recharging from primary frequency control. We show that optimally
combining the two services increases value from batteries significantly.

  Functional programming models have recently seen a renaissance in the systems

CRN probes the PU and subsequently eavesdrops the reverse PU link to acquire
the binary ACK/NACK packet. This feedback indicates whether the probing-induced
interference is harmful or not and can be used to learn the PU interference
constraint. The cognitive part of this sequential probing process is the
selection of the power levels of the Secondary Users (SUs) which aims to learn
the PU interference constraint with a minimum number of probing attempts while
setting a limit on the number of harmful probing-induced interference events or
equivalently of NACK packet observations over a time window. This constrained
design problem is studied within the Active Learning (AL) framework and an
optimal solution is derived and implemented with a sophisticated, accurate and

performance of this solution is also demonstrated through numerical simulations

  procedures","21 pages; 1 figure",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider linear regression model estimation where the covariate of
interest is randomly censored. Under a non-informative censoring mechanism, one
may obtain valid estimates by deleting censored observations. However, this
comes at a cost of lost information and decreased efficiency, especially under
heavy censoring. Other methods for dealing with censored covariates, such as
ignoring censoring or replacing censored observations with a fixed number,
often lead to severely biased results and are of limited practicality.
Parametric methods based on maximum likelihood estimation as well as
semiparametric and non-parametric methods have been successfully used in linear
regression estimation with censored covariates where censoring is due to a
limit of detection.
  In this paper, we adapt some of these methods to handle randomly censored
covariates and compare them under different scenarios to recently-developed
semiparametric and nonparametric methods for randomly censored covariates.
Specifically, we consider both dependent and independent randomly censored
mechanisms as well as the impact of using a non-parametric algorithm on the
distribution of the randomly censored covariate. Through extensive simulation
studies, we compare the performance of these methods under different scenarios.
Finally, we illustrate and compare the methods using the Framingham Health
Study data to assess the association between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in
offspring and parental age at onset of a clinically-diagnosed cardiovascular

substantial synchrotron self absorbed opacity at 86 GHz. A parametric analysis

industry. Many such problems require finding a solution that maximizes the
number of constraints satisfied. Often, these problems are particularly
difficult to solve because they belong to the NP-hard class, namely algorithms
that always find a solution in polynomial time are not known. Over the past
decades, research has focused on developing heuristic approaches that attempt
to find an approximation to the solution. However, despite numerous research
efforts, in many cases even approximations to the optimal solution are hard to
find, as the computational time for further refining a candidate solution grows
exponentially with input size. Here, we show a non-combinatorial approach to
hard optimization problems that achieves an exponential speed-up and finds
better approximations than the current state-of-the-art. First, we map the
optimization problem into a boolean circuit made of specially designed,
self-organizing logic gates, which can be built with (non-quantum) electronic
components; the equilibrium points of the circuit represent the approximation
to the problem at hand. Then, we solve its associated non-linear ordinary
differential equations numerically, towards the equilibrium points. We
demonstrate this exponential gain by comparing a sequential MatLab
implementation of our solver with the winners of the 2016 Max-SAT competition
on a variety of hard optimization instances. We show empirical evidence that
our solver scales linearly with the size of the problem, both in time and
memory, and argue that this property derives from the collective behavior of
the simulated physical circuit. Our approach can be applied to other types of
optimization problems and the results presented here have far-reaching
consequences in many fields.

molecules are projected along arbitrary viewing directions to yield noisy 2D
images. The volume maps representing these potentials typically exhibit a great
deal of structural variability, which is described by their 3D covariance
matrix. Typically, this covariance matrix is approximately low-rank and can be
used to cluster the volumes or estimate the intrinsic geometry of the
conformation space. We formulate the estimation of this covariance matrix as a
linear inverse problem, yielding a consistent least-squares estimator. For $n$
images of size $N$-by-$N$ pixels, we propose an algorithm for calculating this
covariance estimator with computational complexity
$\mathcal{O}(nN^4+\sqrt{\kappa}N^6 \log N)$, where the condition number
$\kappa$ is empirically in the range $10$--$200$. Its efficiency relies on the
observation that the normal equations are equivalent to a deconvolution problem
in 6D. This is then solved by the conjugate gradient method with an appropriate
circulant preconditioner. The result is the first computationally efficient
algorithm for consistent estimation of 3D covariance from noisy projections. It
also compares favorably in runtime with respect to previously proposed
non-consistent estimators. Motivated by the recent success of eigenvalue
shrinkage procedures for high-dimensional covariance matrices, we introduce a
shrinkage procedure that improves accuracy at lower signal-to-noise ratios. We
evaluate our methods on simulated datasets and achieve classification results
comparable to state-of-the-art methods in shorter running time. We also present

Monitoring diagnosis using guided waves. In this article, two methods for
temperature compensation are used to evaluate the temperature of a structure
monitored by Piezoceramic Transducers (PZT). The first one consists in a linear
regression of the static capacity of the PZT (computed with the
electromechanical impedance) with the temperature. It allows one to determine
temperature of a PZT from any impedance measurement. The second method is based
on the Modes Frequency Shift (MFS) of the frequency response function (FRF)
calculated in a pitch-catch mode with an exponential sweep signal. A linear
regression between the MFS and the temperature is settled for most modes and
allow the estimation of temperature between two PZT. Experiments on a composite
plate monitored by 5 PZT patches showed that a $\pm$2{\textdegree}C degree
variation can easily be identified with both methods. Combined together, those
two methods could replace actual temperature sensors and bring an efficient
improvement for temperature compensation in applications where the temperature
variation is heterogeneous on a structure.

fixed-point iteration method, where the linearized problem at each iteration is
treated by means of a modal approach. The proposed approach does not require
meshing of the solution domain, which results in fast computations comparing to
conventional mesh-based numerical techniques. Both harmonic and pulse
excitations are considered via Fourier and Laplace transform, respectively. An
efficient method for the fast computation of the inverse Laplace transform of
the magnetic polarization signals is also devised based on the generalized
pencil-of-function (GPOF) method. Although being restricted to one dimensional
configurations, the present work provide the tools for the treatment of two and
three dimensional problems, whose study is under way.
