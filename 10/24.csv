Dean vortices in bent pipes and may cause fatigue in piping systems. Despite
thirty years worth of research, the mechanism that causes these oscillations
and the frequencies that characterise them remain unclear. Here we show that a
three-dimensional wave-like structure is responsible for the low-frequency
switching of the dominant Dean vortex. The present study, performed via direct
numerical simulation, focuses on the turbulent flow through a 90 \degree pipe
bend preceded and followed by straight pipe segments. A pipe with curvature 0.3
(defined as ratio between pipe radius and bend radius) is studied for a bulk
Reynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number
Re_\tau \approx 360. Synthetic turbulence is generated at the inflow section
and used instead of the classical recycling method in order to avoid the
interference between recycling and swirl-switching frequencies. The flow field
is analysed by three-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which
for the first time allows the identification of the source of swirl-switching:
a wave-like structure that originates in the pipe bend. Contrary to some
previous studies, the flow in the upstream pipe does not show any direct
influence on the swirl-switching modes. Our analysis further shows that a
three- dimensional characterisation of the modes is crucial to understand the
mechanism, and that reconstructions based on 2D POD modes are incomplete.

many detected exoplanets orbit. Flares are energetic, impulsive events, and
their impact on exoplanetary atmospheres needs to be taken into account when
interpreting transit observations. We have developed a model to describe the
upper atmosphere of Extrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs) orbiting flaring stars. The
model simulates thermal escape from the upper atmospheres of close-in EGPs.
Ionisation by solar radiation and electron impact is included and photochemical
and diffusive transport processes are simulated. This model is used to study
the effect of stellar flares from the solar-like G star HD209458 and the young
K star HD189733 on their respective planets. A hypothetical HD209458b-like
planet orbiting the active M star AU Mic is also simulated. We find that the
neutral upper atmosphere of EGPs is not significantly affected by typical
flares. Therefore, stellar flares alone would not cause large enough changes in
planetary mass loss to explain the variations in HD189733b transit depth seen
in previous studies, although we show that it may be possible that an extreme
stellar proton event could result in the required mass loss. Our simulations do
however reveal an enhancement in electron number density in the ionosphere of
these planets, the peak of which is located in the layer where stellar X-rays
are absorbed. Electron densities are found to reach 2.2 to 3.5 times pre-flare
levels and enhanced electron densities last from about 3 to 10 hours after the
onset of the flare. The strength of the flare and the width of its spectral
energy distribution affect the range of altitudes that see enhancements in
ionisation. A large broadband continuum component in the XUV portion of the
flaring spectrum in very young flare stars, such as AU Mic, results in a broad
range of altitudes affected in planets orbiting this star.

are spin-frustrated Mott insulators near the insulator-metal transition, where
theory predicts a Fermi surface associated with neutral low energy excitations.
Here we reveal another route to experimentally realise a Fermi surface in the
absence of a Fermi liquid by the experimental study of a Kondo insulator
SmB$_6$ positioned close to the insulator-metal transition. We present
experimental signatures down to low temperatures ($\ll 1$ K) associated with a
Fermi surface in the bulk, including a sizeable linear specific heat
coefficient, and on the application of a finite magnetic field, bulk magnetic
quantum oscillations, finite quantum oscillatory entropy, and substantial
enhancement in thermal conductivity well below the charge gap energy scale.
Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that despite an extreme instance of
Fermi liquid breakdown in Kondo insulating SmB$_6$, a Fermi surface arises from
novel itinerant low energy excitations that couple to magnetic fields, but not
weak DC electric fields.

the Euler equations lose hyperbolicity and form a degenerate system of

existing layered compounds Ta$_3$SiTe$_6$ and Nb$_3$SiTe$_6$, enabled by
nonsymmorphic symmetries. We show that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling
(SOC), these three-dimensional (3D) bulk materials possess accidental Dirac
loops and essential fourfold nodal lines. In the presence of SOC, there emerges
an hourglass Dirac loop---a fourfold degenerate nodal loop, on which each point
is a neck-point of an hourglass-type dispersion. We show that this interesting
type of band-crossing is protected and dictated by the nonsymmorphic space
group symmetries, and it gives rise to drumhead-like surface states.
Furthermore, we also investigate these materials in the monolayer form. We show
that these two-dimensional (2D) monolayers host nodal lines in the absence of
SOC, and the nodal lines transform to essential spin-orbit Dirac points when
SOC is included. Our work suggests a realistic material platform for exploring
the fascinating physics associated with nonsymmorphic band-crossings in both 3D
and 2D systems.

operations research and computer science (e.g., in applications in
bioinformatics, image processing, social network analysis, etc.). As sizes of
data sets have grown rapidly, researchers have focused on designing algorithms
for clustering problems in models of computation suited for large-scale
computation such as MapReduce, Pregel, and streaming models. The $k$-machine
model (Klauck et al., SODA 2015) is a simple, message-passing model for
large-scale distributed graph processing. This paper considers three of the
most prominent examples of clustering problems: the uncapacitated facility
location problem, the $p$-median problem, and the $p$-center problem and
presents $O(1)$-factor approximation algorithms for these problems running in
$\tilde{O}(n/k)$ rounds in the $k$-machine model. These algorithms are optimal
up to polylogarithmic factors because this paper also shows
$\tilde{\Omega}(n/k)$ lower bounds for obtaining polynomial-factor
approximation algorithms for these problems. These are the first results for
clustering problems in the $k$-machine model.
  We assume that the metric provided as input for these clustering problems in
only implicitly provided, as an edge-weighted graph and in a nutshell, our main
technical contribution is to show that constant-factor approximation algorithms
for all three clustering problems can be obtained by learning only a small
portion of the input metric.

novel realization of an ``entangled'' 4D QH phase which cannot be factorized
into two copies of 2D QH phases, each described by the 1st Chern number. The

entanglement entropy inspired by quantum information theory. In another

in the analysis of spatio-temporal or hypersurface data structures. It is often
made in situations where the covariance structure cannot be easily estimated,
for example because of a small sample size or because of computational storage
problems. In this paper we propose a new and very simple test to validate this
assumption. Our approach is based on a measure of separability which is zero in
the case of separability and positive otherwise. The measure can be estimated
without calculating the full non-separable covariance operator. We prove
asymptotic normality of the corresponding statistic with a limiting variance,
which can easily be estimated from the available data. As a consequence
quantiles of the standard normal distribution can be used to obtain critical
values and the new test of separability is very easy to implement. In
particular, our approach does neither require projections on subspaces
generated by the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator, nor resampling
procedures to obtain critical values nor distributional assumptions as used by
other available methods of constructing tests for separability. We investigate
the finite sample performance by means of a simulation study and also provide a
comparison with the currently available methodology. Finally, the new procedure
is illustrated analyzing wind speed and temperature data.

acting buyer and seller, each holding valuations for the item, drawn from
publicly known distributions. A mechanism is supposed to facilitate trade
between these agents, if such trade is beneficial. It was recently shown that
the only mechanisms that are simultaneously DSIC, SBB, and ex-post IR, are
fixed price mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are parametrised by a price p,
and trade occurs if and only if the valuation of the buyer is at least p and
the valuation of the seller is at most p. The gain from trade is the increase
in welfare that results from applying a mechanism; here we study the gain from
trade achievable by fixed price mechanisms. We explore this question for both
the bilateral trade setting, and a double auction setting where there are
multiple buyers and sellers. We first identify a fixed price mechanism that
achieves a gain from trade of at least 2/r times the optimum, where r is the
probability that the seller's valuation does not exceed the buyer's valuation.
This extends a previous result by McAfee. Subsequently, we improve this
approximation factor in an asymptotic sense, by showing that a more
sophisticated rule for setting the fixed price results in an expected gain from
trade within a factor O(log(1/r)) of the optimal gain from trade. This is
asymptotically the best approximation factor possible. Lastly, we extend our
study of fixed price mechanisms to the double auction setting defined by a set
of multiple i.i.d. unit demand buyers, and i.i.d. unit supply sellers. We
present a fixed price mechanism that achieves a gain from trade that achieves
for all epsilon > 0 a gain from trade of at least (1-epsilon) times the
expected optimal gain from trade with probability 1 - 2/e^{#T epsilon^2 /2},
where #T is the expected number of trades resulting from the double auction.

the activity of catalysts based on the free energies of reaction intermediates.
The incorporation of the state of the catalyst surface under the
electrochemical operating conditions while constructing the free energy diagram
is crucial, without which even trends in activity predictions could be
imprecisely captured. Surface Pourbaix diagrams indicate the surface state as a
function of the pH and the potential. In this work, we utilize error-estimation
capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional as an ensemble
approach to propagate the uncertainty associated with the adsorption energetics
in the construction of Pourbaix diagrams. Within this approach,
surface-transition phase boundaries are no longer sharp and are therefore
associated with a finite width. We determine the surface phase diagram for
several transition metals under reaction conditions and electrode potentials
relevant for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). We observe that our surface
phase predictions for most predominant species are in good agreement with
cyclic voltammetry experiments and prior DFT studies. We use the OH$^*$
intermediate for comparing adsorption characteristics on Pt(111), Pt(100),
Pd(111), Ir(111), Rh(111), and Ru(0001) since it has been shown to have a
higher prediction efficiency relative to O$^*$, and find the trend
Ru>Rh>Ir>Pt>Pd for (111) metal facets, where Ru binds OH$^*$ the strongest. We
robustly predict the likely surface phase as a function of reaction conditions
by associating c-values to quantifying the confidence in predictions within the

experimentally observed surface phases and peak assignments can be better
rationalized.

likelihood of an attribute pattern, a Dirichlet distribution is used as the
prior to sample from the posterior. The Dirichlet distribution is constructed
using Gamma distributions. Correlated attributes of examinees are generated
using the inverse transform sampling. Model parameters are estimated using the
Metropolis within Gibbs sampler sequentially. Two simulation studies are
conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The first simulation
uses a complete and balanced Q-matrix that measures 5 attributes. Comprised of
28 items and 9 attributes, the Q-matrix for the second simulation is incomplete

in the O4I(n)fp star $\zeta$ Puppis: one single periodic non-sinusoidal
component superimposed on a stochastic component. The monoperiodic component is
the $1.78$ d signal previously detected by Coriolis/SMEI, but this time along
with a prominent first harmonic. The shape of this signal changes over time, a
behaviour that is incompatible with stellar oscillations but consistent with
rotational modulation arising from evolving bright surface inhomogeneities. By
means of a constrained non-linear light curve inversion algorithm we mapped the
locations of the bright surface spots and traced their evolution. Our
simultaneous ground-based multi-site spectroscopic monitoring of the star
unveiled cyclical modulation of its He II $\lambda4686$ wind emission line with
the $1.78$-day rotation period, showing signatures of Corotating Interaction
Regions (CIRs) that turn out to be driven by the bright photospheric spots
observed by BRITE. Traces of wind clumps are also observed in the He II
$\lambda4686$ line and are correlated with the amplitudes of the stochastic
component of the light variations probed by BRITE at the photosphere,
suggesting that the BRITE observations additionally unveiled the photospheric
drivers of wind clumps in $\zeta$ Pup and that the clumping phenomenon starts
at the very base of the wind. The origins of both the bright surface
inhomogeneities and the stochastic light variations remain unknown, but a
subsurface convective zone might play an important role in the generation of
these two types of photospheric variability.

so far. Here we have used a sample of 29 well-studied double-lined eclipsing

dependence of f(ov) on mass, where f(ov) is the free parameter in the diffusive

the 4.4 solar mass limit of our sample. Tests with two different element
mixtures indicate the trend is the same, and we find it is also qualitatively
similar to the one established in our previous study with the classical
step-function implementation of overshooting characterized by the free

sample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC
definitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the
extremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the
criteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the
CC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed
fractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result
is partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed
gas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative
agreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the
simulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs
appears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the
fraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are
more relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting
CCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC
criteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is

$\log{M_{*}/M_{\odot}}=11.5,11.0,10.5,10.0$ at $z\sim0.1$ using an evolving

able to measure the time at which half the total stellar mass of the descendant
galaxy was assembled, $t_{a}$, which, in order of decreasing mass corresponds
to redshifts of $z_{a}=1.28, 0.92, 0.60$ and $0.51$. We compare this to the
median light-weighted stellar age $t_{*}$ ($z_{*} = 2.08, 1.49, 0.82$ and
$0.37$) of a sample of low redshift SDSS galaxies (from the literature) and
find the timescales are consistent with more massive galaxies forming a higher
fraction of their stars ex-situ compared to lower mass descendants. We find
that both $t_{*}$ and $t_{a}$ strongly correlate with mass which is in contrast
to what is found in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation which shows a flat
relationship between $t_{a}$ and $M_{*}$. However, the semi-analytic model of
\citet{henriques2015} is consistent with the observations in both $t_{a}$ and
$t_{*}$ with $M_{*}$, showing the most recent semi-analytic models are better
able to decouple the evolution of the baryons from the dark matter in

resonant lines in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, DR7) spectroscopic sample
to look for neutral gas outflows in the local galaxies. Individual galaxy
spectra are stacked in bins of M${\star}$ and SFR to investigate the dependence
of galactic wind occurrence and velocity as a function of the galaxy position
in the SFR-$M{\star}$ plane. In massive galaxies at the high SFR tail we find
evidence of a significant blue-shifted Na I D absorption, which we interpret as
evidence of neutral outflowing gas. The occurrence of the blue-shifted
absorption is observed at the same significance for purely SF galaxies, AGN and
composite systems at fixed SFR. In all classes of objects the blue-shift is the
largest and the Na I D equivalent width the smallest for face-on galaxies while
the absorption feature is at the systemic velocity for edge-on systems. This
indicates that the neutral outflow is mostly perpendicular or biconical with
respect to the galactic disk. We also compare the kinematics of the neutral gas
with the ionized gas phase as traced by the [OIII]$\lambda$5007, H$\alpha$,
[NII]$\lambda6548$ and [NII]$\lambda6584$ emission lines. Differently for the
neutral gas phase, all the emission lines show evidence of perturbed kinematics
only in galaxies with a significant level of nuclear activity and, they are
independent from the disk inclination. In conclusion, we find that, in the
local Universe, galactic winds show two faces which are related to two
different ejection mechanisms, namely the neutral outflowing gas phase related
to the SF activity along the galaxy disk and the ionized phase related to the
AGN feedback. In both the neutral and ionized gas phases, the observed wind
velocities suggest that the outflowing gas remains bound to the galaxy with no
definitive effect on the gas reservoir.

goal is to study the stars from their organization within this abundance space.
Within this space, we seek to find clusters (in a statistical sense), that is,
stars likely to share similar chemo-evolutionary history, using two methods:
the hierarchical clustering and the principal component analysis. We analysed
some selected abundance surveys available in the literature. For each sample,
we labelled the group of stars according to its average abundance curve. In all
samples, we identify the existence of a main enrichment pattern of the stars,
which we call chemical enrichment flow. This flow is set by the structured and
well defined mean rate at which the abundances of the interstellar medium
increase, resulting from the mixture of the material ejected from the stars and
stellar mass loss and interstellar medium gas. One of the main results of our
analysis is the identification of subgroups of stars with peculiar chemistry.
These stars are situated in regions outside of the enrichment flow in the
abundance space. These peculiar stars show a mismatch in the enrichment rate of
a few elements, such as Mg, Si, Sc and V, when compared to the mean enrichment
rate of the other elements of the same stars. We believe the existence of these
groups of stars with peculiar chemistry may be related to the accretion of
planetary material onto stellar surfaces or may be due to production of the
same chemical element by different nucleosynthetic sites.

The calculations highlight the need for improved observations of the CO
emission threshold and HI shielding layer depth. They are also sensitive to the
shape of the column density distribution. Because local clouds collectively
show a self-similar distribution, we predict a shallow metallicity dependence
for X_CO down to a few tenths of solar metallicity. However, our calculations
also imply dramatic variations in cloud-to-cloud X_CO at subsolar metallicity.

using those urban systems at certain time of day and locations. There may exist
clear spatial and temporal correlations among usage patterns across all urban

congestion. We propose a general framework to predict congestion starting time
and congestion duration in the morning using the time-of-day electricity use
data from anonymous households with no personally identifiable information. We
show that using time-of-day electricity data from midnight to early morning
from 322 households in the City of Austin, can make reliable prediction of
congestion starting time of several highway segments, at the time as early as
2am. This predictor significantly outperforms a time-series predictor that uses
only real-time travel time data up to 6am. We found that 8 out of the 10
typical electricity use patterns have statistically significant affects on
morning congestion on highways in Austin. Some patterns have negative effects,
represented by an early spike of electricity use followed by a drastic drop
that could imply early departure from home. Others have positive effects,
represented by a late night spike of electricity use possible implying late
night activities that can lead to late morning departure from home.

form in the human body, its hexameric assembly acts as an efficient storage
unit. However, the role of water molecules in the structure, stability and
dynamics of the insulin hexamer is poorly understood. Here we combine
experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shape,
structure and stability of an insulin hexamer focusing on the role of water
molecules. Both X-Ray analysis and computer simulations show that the core of
the hexamer cavity is barrel-shaped, holding, on an average, sixteen water
molecules. These encapsulated and constrained molecules impart structural
stability to the hexamer. Apart from the electrostatic interactions with Zn2+
ions, an intricate hydrogen bond network amongst cavity water and neighboring
protein residues stabilizes the hexameric association. These water molecules
solvate six glutamate residues inside the cavity decreasing electrostatic
repulsions amongst the negatively charged carboxylate groups. They also prevent
association between glutamate residues and Zn2+ ions and maintain the integrity
of the cavity. Simulations reveal that removal of these waters results in a
collapse of the cavity. Subsequent analyses also show that the hydrogen bond
network among these water molecules and protein residues that face the inner
side of the cavity is more rigid with a slower relaxation as compared to that
of the bulk solvent. Dynamics of cavity water reveal certain slow water
molecules which form the back bone of the stable hydrogen bond network. The
analysis presented here suggests a dominant role of structurally conserved
water molecules in maintaining the integrity of the hexameric assembly and
potentially modulating the dissociation of this assembly into the functional
monomeric form.

In the ISM, the cosmic dust destruction rate is faster than the production rate

to maintain a steady amount of cosmic grains, some supplementary production
mechanism takes place. In this context, we aimed to study possible re-formation
mechanisms of cosmic grains taking place at low temperature directly in the
ISM. The low temperature condensation of carbonaceous materials has been
investigated in experiments mimicking the ISM conditions. Gas-phase
carbonaceous precursors created by laser ablation of graphite were forced to
accrete on cold substrates (T about 10 K) representing surviving dust grains.
The growing and evolution of the condensing carbonaceous precursors have been
monitored by MIR and UV spectroscopy under a number of experimental scenarios.
It is demonstrated, for the first time, the possibility to form ISM
carbonaceous grains in ""situ"". The condensation process is governed by carbon
chains that first condense into small carbon clusters and finally into more
stable carbonaceous materials, which structural characteristics are comparable
to the material formed in gas-phase condensation experiments at very high
temperature. We also show that the so-formed fullerene-like carbonaceous
material is transformed into a more ordered material under VUV processing. The
cold condensation mechanisms here discussed can give fundamental clues to fully
understand the balance between the timescale for dust injection, destruction

  Every Step","18 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a family of generative models that
do not minimize a single training criterion. Unlike other generative models,
the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative
model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each
minimize their own cost. GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which
each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players'
parameters. One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a
divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains
its minimum value at equilibrium. Several recent research directions have been
motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the
learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the
divergence. We show that this view is overly restrictive. During GAN training,
the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of
the divergences between distributions would not be useful. We provide empirical
counterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization.
Specifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in
situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would
fail. We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence
minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in
which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be
helpful. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may
be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do
not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.

door to the geometric engineering of many physical systems, and in particular
those involving Higgs bundles. This note presents a curated overview of some
current advances and open problems in the area, with no intention of being a

the problem of finding such solutions reduces to finding feasible solutions for

layer by comparing nightly mean temperatures measured by the ground-based
spectrometer GRIPS 9 and the Na lidar at ALOMAR. The data set contains 42
coincident measurements between November 2010 and February 2014, when GRIPS 9
was in operation at the ALOMAR observatory (69.3$^\circ$N, 16.0$^\circ$E) in
northern Norway. To closely resemble the mean temperature measured by GRIPS 9,
I weight each nightly mean temperature profile measured by the lidar using
Gaussian distributions with 40 different centre altitudes and 40 different full
widths at half maximum. In principle, one can thus determine the altitude and
width of an airglow layer by finding the minimum temperature difference between
the two instruments. On most nights, several combinations of centre altitude
and width yield a temperature difference of $\pm$2 K. The generally assumed
altitude of 87 km and width of 8 km is never an unambiguous, good solution for
any of the measurements. Even for a fixed width of $\sim$8.4 km, one can
sometimes find several centre altitudes that yield equally good temperature
agreement. Weighted temperatures measured by lidar are not suitable to
determine unambiguously the emission height and width of an airglow layer.
However, when actual altitude and width data are lacking, a comparison with
lidars can provide an estimate of how representative a measured rotational
temperature is of an assumed altitude and width. I found the rotational
temperature to represent the temperature at the commonly assumed altitude of
87.4 km and width of 8.4 km to within $\pm$16 K, on average. This is not a
measurement uncertainty.

satellite torques, either through an individual resonance or through
overlapping resonances. For the A ring of Saturn, it has been commonly believed
that the satellite Janus alone can prevent the ring from spreading via its 7:6
Lindblad resonance. We discuss this common misconception and show that, in
reality, the A ring is confined by the contributions from the group of
satellites Pan, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, Epimetheus, and Mimas, whose
cumulative torques from various resonances gradually decrease the angular
momentum flux transported outward through the ring via density and bending
waves. We further argue that this decrease in angular momentum flux occurs
through 'flux reversal'.
  Furthermore, we use the magnitude of the satellites' resonance torques to
estimate the effective viscosity profile across the A ring, showing that it
decreases with radius from ~50 cm2 s-1 to less than ~10 cm2 s-1. The gradual
estimated decrease of the angular momentum flux and effective viscosity are
roughly consistent with results obtained by balancing the shepherding torques
from Pan and Daphnis with the viscous torque at the edges of the Encke and
Keeler gaps, as well as the edge of the A ring.
  On the other hand, the Mimas 2:1 Lindblad resonance alone seems to be capable
of confining the edge of the B ring, and contrary to the situation in the A
ring, we show that the effective viscosity across the B ring is relatively
constant at ~24-30 cm2 s-1.

However, the rate gain of FD transmission in an interference-limited network is
not as clear as a P2P link due to the interferences induced by complex FD and
half-duplex (HD) transmission behaviors in the network. To thoroughly
investigate the achievable link rates of users and base stations (BSs) in a

approach is proposed to model a HetNet in which all BSs and users can perform
HD or FD transmission depending on their traffic patterns. We first
characterize the decoupled rate-optimal user association scheme and use it to
define the downlink and uplink rates in the HetNet. The tight lower bounds on
the link rates of the FD users and BSs are found in a neat form that
characterizes general channel fading, user and BS intensities and imperfect
self-interference cancellation. These bounds outline the rate regions of the FD
users that inspire proposing the opportunistic FD scheduling algorithms

  Seasonal Profiles in Time Series",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Providing long-range forecasts is a fundamental challenge in time series
modeling, which is only compounded by the challenge of having to form such
forecasts when a time series has never previously been observed. The latter
challenge is the time series version of the cold-start problem seen in
recommender systems which, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in previous
work. A similar problem occurs when a long range forecast is required after
only observing a small number of time points --- a warm start forecast. With
these aims in mind, we focus on forecasting seasonal profiles---or baseline
demand---for periods on the order of a year in three cases: the long range case
with multiple previously observed seasonal profiles, the cold start case with
no previous observed seasonal profiles, and the warm start case with only a
single partially observed profile. Classical time series approaches that
perform iterated step-ahead forecasts based on previous observations struggle
to provide accurate long range predictions; in settings with little to no
observed data, such approaches are simply not applicable. Instead, we present a
straightforward framework which combines ideas from high-dimensional regression
and matrix factorization on a carefully constructed data matrix. Key to our
formulation and resulting performance is leveraging (1) repeated patterns over
fixed periods of time and across series, and (2) metadata associated with the
individual series; without this additional data, the cold-start/warm-start
problems are nearly impossible to solve. We demonstrate that our framework can
accurately forecast an array of seasonal profiles on multiple large scale
datasets.

lepton-flavor-violating decays of SM leptons into three charged leptons, with
no final-state neutrinos. We implement our expressions for the leading
contributions to ${\rm Br}(l_\alpha\to l_\beta\,l_\sigma\,l_\sigma)$, which
hold for either Dirac or Majorana neutrinos, to the trilepton decay $\mu\to3e$,
of the muon, and so determine sets of masses of heavy neutrinos and the heavy
gauge boson, within GeVs to few TeVs, that are consistent with the upper bounds
provided by the SINDRUM Collaboration. We find, however, that constraints
dictated by the upper bound on ${\rm Br}(\mu\to e\gamma)$, from the MEG
Collaboration, are more stringent. We utilize such parameters to find that the
contributions to tau decays are $\sim10^{-15}-10^{-13}$, well below bounds from
$B$ factories. The mixing of heavy and SM charged bosons is also investigated.
We find that current experimental data from MEG and SINDRUM would allow mixing
angles as large as $\sim10^{-2}$, for a relatively light new charged boson, but
the expected sensitivity of the Mu3e experiment would be capable of setting an
upper bound on this angle as small as $\sim10^{-4}$ if the mass of this boson
is within the range of few TeVs.

integrated in one control framework, the coupling between wireless
communication reliability and system states is not well modeled. Furthermore,
the research on the impact of jamming attacks on the system stability and
safety is largely open. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on
the stability and safety of the platoon under the wireless Rician fading
channel model and jamming attacks. The effect of Rician fading and jamming on
the communication reliability is incorporated in the modeling of string
dynamics such that it captures its state dependency. Time-domain definition of
string stability is utilized to delineate the impact of Rician fading and
jamming on the CACC system's functionality and string stability. Attacker's
possible locations at which it can destabilize the string is further studied
based on the proposed model. From the safety perspective, reachable states
(i.e., inter-vehicle distances) of the CACC system under unreliable wireless
fading channels and jamming attacks is studied. Safety verification is
investigated by examining the inter-vehicle distance trajectories. We propose a
methodology to compute the upper and lower bounds of the trajectories of
inter-vehicle distances between the lead vehicle and its follower. We conduct
extensive simulations to evaluate the system stability and safety under jamming
attacks in different scenarios. We identify that channel fading can degrade the
performance of the CACC system, and the platoon's safety is highly sensitive to

disc groups ranges from -10 to +15^\circ, but there is no evident relation
between l_{uw} and the mean abundances. However we find a weak relation for
l_{uw} as a function of iron abundances and \alpha-elements for most of the
groups in the thick disc, where the tilt angle decreases from -5 to -20^\circ
when [Fe/H] decreases and [\alpha/Fe] increases. The velocity anisotropy
parameter is independent of the chemical group abundances and its value is
nearly constant for both discs (\beta \sim 0.5), suggesting that the combined

metastable polymorphs, rapid and reliable assessment of their lifetimes is
essential. Motivated by the early work of Buerger (1951), here we investigate
the routes to predict kinetics of polymorphic transformations using solely
crystallographic arguments. As part of this investigation we developed a
general algorithm to map crystal structures onto each other and construct
transformation pathways between them. The developed algorithm reproduces
reliably known transformation pathways and reveals the critical role that the
dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway plays in choosing the best
(low-energy barrier) mapping. By utilizing our structure-mapping algorithm we
were able to quantitatively demonstrate the intuitive expectation that the
minimal dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway, or in ionic systems,
the condition of coordination of atoms along the pathway not decreasing below
the coordination in the end compounds, represents the requirement for fast
transformation kinetics. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the
structure-mapping algorithm in combination with the coordination analysis in
studying transformations between polymorphs for which a detailed atomic-level
picture is presently elusive.

magnetic anomaly with the Coulomb field of the closely spaced heavy nuclei are
evaluated as a function of the internuclear distance and the charge of the

It is shown, that the levels shifts near the lower continuum decrease with the
enlarging size of the system of Coulomb sources both in the absolute units and

appropriately resilient to communication failures between the various agents.
In many common game-theoretic formulations of these types of systems, it is
implicitly assumed that all agents have access to as much information about
other agents' actions as needed. This paper endeavors to augment these
game-theoretic methods with policies that would allow agents to react
on-the-fly to losses of this information. Unfortunately, we show that even if a
single agent loses communication with one other weakly-coupled agent, this can
cause arbitrarily-bad system states to emerge as various solution concepts of
an associated game, regardless of how the agent accounts for the communication
failure and regardless of how weakly coupled the agents are. Nonetheless, we
show that the harm that communication failures can cause is limited by the
structure of the problem; when agents' action spaces are richer, problems are
more susceptible to these types of pathologies. Finally, we undertake an
initial study into how a system designer might prevent these pathologies, and
explore a few limited settings in which communication failures cannot cause
harm.

disease based on the differences between a pre-treatment and a post-treatment
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Background adjustment is necessary to
reduce confounding by tissue-dependent changes not related to the disease. When
modeling the voxel intensities for the two scans as a bivariate Gaussian
mixture, background adjustment translates into standardizing the mixture at
each voxel, while tumor lesions present themselves as outliers to be detected.
In this paper, we address the question of how to standardize the mixture to a
standard multivariate normal distribution, so that the outliers (i.e., tumor
lesions) can be detected using a statistical test. We show theoretically and
numerically that the tail distribution of the standardized scores is favorably
close to standard normal in a wide range of scenarios while being conservative
at the tails, validating voxelwise hypothesis testing based on standardized
scores. To address standardization in spatially heterogeneous image data, we
propose a spatial and robust multivariate expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, where prior class membership probabilities are provided by
transformation of spatial probability template maps and the estimation of the
class mean and covariances are robust to outliers. Simulations in both
univariate and bivariate cases suggest that standardized scores with soft
assignment have tail probabilities that are either very close to or more
conservative than standard normal. The proposed methods are applied to a real
data set from a PET phantom experiment, yet they are generic and can be used in
other contexts.

counterpart of a gravitational-wave transient (GW170817) from a binary neutron
star merger. After this merger the $\gamma$-ray light curve exhibited a faint
peak at $\sim$ 1.7s and the X-ray, optical and radio light curves displayed an
extended emission which increased in brightness up to $\sim$ 160 days. In this
paper, we show that the X-ray, optical and radio fluxes are consistent with the
synchrotron forward-shock model viewed off-axis when the matter in the outflow
is parametrized through a power law velocity distribution. We discuss the
origin of the $\gamma$-ray peak in terms of internal and external shocks. We
show that the $\gamma$-ray flux might be consistent with a synchrotron
self-Compton reverse-shock model observed at high latitudes. Comparing the
best-fit values obtained after describing the $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical and
radio fluxes with our model, we find that the afterglow and $\gamma$-ray
emission occurred in different regions and also evidence to propose that the
progenitor environment was entrained with magnetic fields and therefore, we
argue for the presence of the magnetic field amplification in the binary

behavior which is similar to but actually deviating from the exact solution in
the transition region, where we confirm that the CL simulation becomes
susceptible to the drift singularities, i.e., zeros of the fermion determinant.
In order to simulate the transition region with the CL method correctly, we
examine two approaches, a reweighting method and a model deformation, in both
of which a single thimble with an attractive fixed point practically covers the
integration domain and the CL sampling avoids the determinant zeros. It turns
out that these methods can reproduce the correct crossover behavior of the
original model with using reference ensembles in the complexified space.
However, they need evaluation of the reweighting factor, which scales with the
system size exponentially. We discuss feasibility of applying these methods to
the Thirring model and to more realistic theories.

much packets as possible in each transmission operation. The network coding
technique improves the throughput efficiency of multi-hop wireless networks by
taking advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, there
are some scenarios where the coding cannot be exploited due to the stochastic
nature of the packet arrival process in the network. In these cases, the coding
node faces two critical choices: forwarding the packet towards the destination
without coding, thereby sacrificing the advantage of network coding, or,
waiting for a while until a coding opportunity arises for the packets. Current
research works have addressed this challenge for the case of a simple and
restricted scheme called reverse carpooling where it is assumed that two flows
with opposite directions arrive at the coding node. In this paper the issue is
explored in a general sense based on the COPE architecture requiring no
assumption about flows in multi-hop wireless networks. In particular, we

optimal stopping theory, and derive the optimal stopping rule for the coding
node to choose the optimal action to take, i.e. to wait for more coding

the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of network throughput

be extended further by increasing the oxygen chemical potential through the use
of an elevated oxygen pressure or by incorporating electron redistributing

This paper describes IPv6 address collection by exhaustively sweeping the
reverse DNS domain for the IPv4 address space and performing AAAA queries on
the results. Subsequent ICMP and TCP measurements are conducted to measure the
responsiveness of the resulting set. Key outcomes include: the PTR sweep
discovers 965,304 unique, globally routable IPv6 addresses originating from
5,531 ASNs. 56% of the addresses are responsive, across 4,571 ASNs. Upon
inferring pairs of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that are likely associated with the
same device, the data indicates a trend toward IPv4 addresses being more
responsive than their IPv6 counterparts, with a higher incidence rate of TCP
connections being refused, and wide disparity on where TCP connections or ICMP
echo requests fail silently when comparing IPv4 and IPv6. The disparity in IPv4

configuration and network policies across the two networks, presenting
potential policy or security gaps as the IPv6 network matures.

string theory. There are two kinds of hidden symmetries investigated in this
work: the first type is associated with dynamics of quantum fields and the
second type is related to integrability of strings on various backgrounds. The
goals of this thesis are twofold: extension of hidden symmetries known in
general relativity to stringy backgrounds in higher dimensions and construction
of new integrable string theories.
  In the context of the first goal we study hidden symmetries of stringy
backgrounds, with and without supersymmetry. For supersymmetric geometries
produced by D--branes we identify the backgrounds with solvable equations for
geodesics, which can potentially give rise to integrable string theories.
Relaxing the requirement of supersymmetry, we also study charged black holes in
higher dimensions and identify their hidden symmetries encoded in so--called
Killing(-Yano) tensors. We construct the explicit form of the Killing(-Yano)
tensors for the charged rotating black hole in arbitrary number of dimensions,
study behavior of such tensors under string dualities, and use the analysis of
hidden symmetries to explain why exact solutions for black rings (black holes
with non-spherical event horizons) in more than five dimensions remain elusive.
As a byproduct we identify the standard parameterization of AdSp x S^q
backgrounds with elliptic coordinates on a flat base.
  The second goal of this work is construction of new integrable string
theories by applying continuous deformations of known examples. We use the
recent developments called (generalized) lambda-deformation to construct new
integrable backgrounds depending on several continuous parameters and study
analytical properties of the such deformations.

research thanks to their innate ability for self-renewal and differentiation
into all major cell lines. The fateful decision to exit or remain in the
pluripotent state is regulated by complex genetic regulatory network. Latest
advances in transcriptomics have made it possible to infer basic topologies of
pluripotency governing networks. The inferred network topologies, however, only
encode boolean information while remaining silent about the roles of dynamics
and molecular noise in gene expression. These features are widely considered
essential for functional decision making. Herein we developed a framework for
extending the boolean level networks into models accounting for individual
genetic switches and promoter architecture which allows mechanistic
interrogation of the roles of molecular noise, external signaling, and network
topology. We demonstrate the pluripotent state of the network to be a broad
attractor which is robust to variations of gene expression. Dynamics of exiting
the pluripotent state, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the
molecular noise originating from genetic switching events which makes cells
more responsive to extracellular signals. Lastly we show that steady state
probability landscape can be significantly remodeled by global gene switching
rates alone which can be taken as a proxy for how global epigenetic
modifications exert control over stability of pluripotent states.

spectrum. In particular, a light flavorsinglet scalar appears in the spectrum
which is nearly degenerate with the pseudo-NambuGoldstone bosons (PNGBs) at the
lightest currently accessible quark masses. This state is a viable candidate
for a composite Higgs boson. Presently, an acceptable effective field theory
(EFT) description of the light states in walking theories has not been
established. Such an EFT would be useful for performing chiral extrapolations
of lattice data and for serving as a bridge between lattice calculations and
phenomenology. It has been shown that the chiral Lagrangian fails to describe
the IR dynamics of a theory near the edge of the conformal window. Here we
assess a linear sigma model as an alternate EFT description by performing
explicit chiral fits to lattice data. Our model provides an acceptable combined
fit to the PNGB mass and decay constant, reducing the $\chi^2$/d.o.f. by more

the variation is known, is considerably harder than that of measuring a
constant phase. In particular, the usual bounds on accuracy - such as the
$1/(4\bar{n})$ standard quantum limit with coherent states - do not apply.
Here, restricting to coherent states, we are able to analytically obtain the
achievable accuracy - the equivalent of the standard quantum limit - for a wide
class of phase variation. In particular, we consider the case where the phase
has Gaussian statistics and a power-law spectrum equal to
$\kappa^{p-1}/|\omega|^p$ for large $\omega$, for some $p>1$. For coherent
states with mean photon flux ${\cal N}$, we give the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound
on the mean-square phase error as $[p \sin (\pi/p)]^{-1}(4{\cal
N}/\kappa)^{-(p-1)/p}$. Next, we consider whether the bound can be achieved by
an adaptive homodyne measurement, in the limit ${\cal N}/\kappa \gg 1$ which
allows the photocurrent to be linearized. Applying the optimal filtering for
the resultant linear Gaussian system, we find the same scaling with ${\cal N}$,
but with a prefactor larger by a factor of $p$. By contrast, if we employ
optimal smoothing we can exactly obtain the Quantum Cram{\'e}r-Rao Bound. That
is, contrary to previously considered ($p=2$) cases of phase estimation, here
the improvement offered by smoothing over filtering is not limited to a factor
of 2 but rather can be unbounded by a factor of $p$. We also study numerically
the performance of these estimators for an adaptive measurement in the limit
where ${\cal N}/\kappa$ is not large, and find a more complicated picture.

this letter I show that the abrupt drop in the baryonic sound speed across
recombination leads to conditions resulting in such large thermodynamic
Gaussian fluctuations in the ionisation fraction of the baryons. Under pressure
equilibrium, this will result in a mechanism for generating scale invariant
density and temperature fluctuations in the baryonic component, inherent to the
thermodynamics of the baryons themselves. Within a $\Lambda$CDM framework, this
extra random fluctuation source leads to a decoupling of the inflationary relic
small wave number spectrum and the amplitude of the Gaussian random
fluctuations at frequencies higher than the first acoustic peak, an effect
which could explain the mismatch between cosmic microwave background (CMB)
inferences and local kinetic determinations of the Hubble constant. Within
modified gravity theories in absence of dark matter, the mechanism proposed

needs to be able to reactively adapt to changes arising in its environment. The

adaptation, and for this purpose, a feedback model is required. The feedback

inherently 3-D process where the temperature profile in the current sheet
coupled with the out-of-plane ablation density profile conspires to break
inflowing field lines, reconnecting the field downstream. Fast reconnection is
sustained by both the Biermann effect and the traceless electron pressure

level of mechanical task performance. However, their underlying fundamental
biological vs. engineering mechanisms are, by definition, dramatically
different and can even be antithetical. Even our approach to each is
diametrically opposite: inductive science for the study of biological systems
vs. engineering synthesis for the design and construction of robotic systems.
The past 20 years have seen several conceptual advances in both fields and the
quest to unify them. Chief among them is the reluctant recognition that their
underlying fundamental mechanisms may actually share limited common ground,
while exhibiting many fundamental differences. This recognition is particularly
liberating because it allows us to resolve and move beyond multiple paradoxes
and contradictions that arose from the initial reasonable assumption of a large
common ground. Here, we begin by introducing the perspective of neuromechanics,
which emphasizes that real-world behavior emerges from the intimate
interactions among the physical structure of the system, the mechanical
requirements of a task, the feasible neural control actions to produce it, and
the ability of the neuromuscular system to adapt through interactions with the
environment. This allows us to articulate a succinct overview of a few salient
conceptual paradoxes and contradictions regarding under-determined vs.
over-determined mechanics, under- vs. over-actuated control, prescribed vs.
emergent function, learning vs. implementation vs. adaptation, prescriptive vs.
descriptive synergies, and optimal vs. habitual performance. We conclude by
presenting open questions and suggesting directions for future research. We
hope this frank assessment of the state-of-the-art will encourage and guide

molecular mass of 2.1x10^6Mo, has two velocity components over ~10-15km/s. The
majority of molecular gas in the GMC is included in the lower-velocity
component (LVC) at ~110-114km/s, while the higher-velocity components (HVCs) at
~118-126km/s consist of three smaller molecular clouds which are located near
the three HII regions. The LVC and HVCs show spatially complementary
distributions along the line-of-sight, despite large velocity separations of
~5-15km/s, and are connected in velocity by the CO emission with intermediate
intensities. By comparing the observations with simulations, we discuss a
scenario where collisions of the three HVCs with LVC at velocities of
~10-15km/s can provide an interpretation of these two observational signatures.
The intermediate velocity features between the LVC and HVCs can be understood
as broad bridge features, which indicate the turbulent motion of the gas at the
collision interfaces, while the spatially complementary distributions represent
the cavities created in the LVC by the HVCs through the collisions. Our model
indicates that the three HII regions were formed after the onset of the
collisions, and it is therefore suggested that the high-mass star formation in
the GMC was triggered by the collisions.

  In the first part, we generalize the reduction-based creative telescoping
algorithms to the hypergeometric setting, which allows to deal with definite
sums of hypergeometric terms more quickly. We first modify the
Abramov-Petkovsek reduction, and then design a new algorithm to compute minimal
telescopers for bivariate hypergeometric terms based on the modified reduction.
This new algorithm can avoid the costly computation of certificates, and
outperforms the classical Zeilberger algorithm no matter whether certificates
are computed or not according to the computational experiments. Moreover, we
also derive order bounds for minimal telescopers. These bounds are sometimes
better, and never worse than the known ones.

consists of the limits of convergent P-recursive sequences. Typically, this
class contains many well-known mathematical constants in addition to the
algebraic numbers. Our definition of the class of D-finite numbers depends on
two subrings of the field of complex numbers. We investigate how different
choices of these two subrings affect the class. Moreover, we show that D-finite
numbers over the Gaussian rational field are essentially the same as the values
of D-finite functions at non-singular algebraic number arguments (so-called the
regular holonomic constants). This result makes it easier to recognize certain
numbers as belonging to this class.

emergence of superconductivity because of the competition between the static

superconductor (IBSC) in 2008 was accepted with surprise in the condensed
matter community and rekindled extensive study globally. IBSCs have since grown
to become a new class of high-Tc superconductors next to the high-Tc cuprates
discovered in 1986. The rapid research progress in the science and technology
of IBSCs over the past decade has resulted in the accumulation of a vast amount
of knowledge on IBSC materials, mechanisms, properties, and applications with
the publication of more than several tens of thousands of papers. This article
reviews recent progress in the technical applications (bulk magnets, thin
films, and wires) of IBSCs in addition to their fundamental material
characteristics. Highlights of their applications include high-field bulk
magnets workable at 15-25 K, thin films with high critical current density (Jc)
> 1 MA/cm2 at ~10 T and 4 K, and an average Jc of 1.3*104 A/cm2 at 10 T and 4 K
achieved for a 100-m-class-length wire. These achievements are based on the
intrinsically advantageous properties of IBSCs such as the higher
crystallographic symmetry of the superconducting phase, higher critical
magnetic field, and larger critical grain boundary angle to maintain high Jc.
These properties also make IBSCs promising for applications using high magnetic
fields.

  Monte Carlo Tree Search","8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a process for efficiently searching over combinations of
individual object 6D pose hypotheses in cluttered scenes, especially in cases
involving occlusions and objects resting on each other. The initial set of
candidate object poses is generated from state-of-the-art object detection and
global point cloud registration techniques. The best-scored pose per object by
using these techniques may not be accurate due to overlaps and occlusions.
Nevertheless, experimental indications provided in this work show that object
poses with lower ranks may be closer to the real poses than ones with high
ranks according to registration techniques. This motivates a global
optimization process for improving these poses by taking into account
scene-level physical interactions between objects. It also implies that the
Cartesian product of candidate poses for interacting objects must be searched
so as to identify the best scene-level hypothesis. To perform the search
efficiently, the candidate poses for each object are clustered so as to reduce
their number but still keep a sufficient diversity. Then, searching over the
combinations of candidate object poses is performed through a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) process that uses the similarity between the observed depth image
of the scene and a rendering of the scene given the hypothesized pose as a
score that guides the search procedure. MCTS handles in a principled way the
tradeoff between fine-tuning the most promising poses and exploring new ones,
by using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique. Experimental results
indicate that this process is able to quickly identify in cluttered scenes
physically-consistent object poses that are significantly closer to ground
truth compared to poses found by point cloud registration methods.

the stellar mass and radius are $1.8M_\odot$ and 10 km, respectively. Thus, one
may probe the spacetime geometry outside the star and even distinguish
gravitational theories via the observation of pulse profile with the help of
another observations for the stellar compactness, if the compactness of central

the flux with respect to a parameter defined by the radio of the gravitational

enables direct content delivery without remote file fetching, which can reduce
the end-to-end delay while relieving backhaul pressure. To effectively utilize
the limited cache size in practice, cooperative caching can be leveraged to
exploit caching diversity, by allowing users served by multiple base stations
under the emerging user-centric network architecture. This paper explores
delay-optimal cooperative edge caching in large-scale user-centric mobile
networks, where the content placement and cluster size are optimized based on
the stochastic information of network topology, traffic distribution, channel
quality, and file popularity. Specifically, a greedy content placement
algorithm is proposed based on the optimal bandwidth allocation, which can
achieve (1-1/e)-optimality with linear computational complexity. In addition,
the optimal user-centric cluster size is studied, and a condition constraining
the maximal cluster size is presented in explicit form, which reflects the
tradeoff between caching diversity and spectrum efficiency. Extensive
simulations are conducted for analysis validation and performance evaluation.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed greedy content placement
algorithm can reduce the average file transmission delay up to 50% compared
with the non-cooperative and hit-ratio-maximal schemes. Furthermore, the
optimal clustering is also discussed considering the influences of different

An important measure of the value of an ad is the probability of conversion.
The focus of this paper is the development of a computationally efficient,
accurate, and precise estimator of conversion probability. The challenges
associated with this estimation problem are the delays in observing conversions
and the size of the data set (both number of observations and number of
predictors). Two models have previously been considered as a basis for
estimation: A logistic regression model and a joint model for observed
conversion statuses and delay times. Fitting the former is simple, but ignoring
the delays in conversion leads to an under-estimate of conversion probability.
On the other hand, the latter is less biased but computationally expensive to
fit. Our proposed estimator is a compromise between these two estimators. We

For optimal detection, the complexity increases exponentially with the product
of the number of users, the number of antennas and the channel length. To
tackle this challenge, we propose near optimal low-complexity iterative
receivers based on factor graph. By introducing auxiliary variables, a
stretched factor graph is constructed and a hybrid belief propagation (BP) and
expectation propagation (EP) receiver, named as `Stretch-BP-EP', is proposed.
Considering the convergence problem of BP algorithm on loopy factor graph, we
convexify the Bethe free energy and propose a convergence-guaranteed BP-EP
receiver, named as `Conv-BP-EP'. We further consider cooperative network and
propose two distributed cooperative detection schemes to exploit the diversity
gain, namely, belief consensus-based algorithm and Bregman alternative
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based method. Simulation results verify
the superior performance of the proposed Conv-BP-EP receiver compared with
other methods. The two proposed distributed cooperative detection schemes can

lattice permit fast Fourier transform beamforming, which reduces the
correlation cost from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in the number of antennas to
$\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$. We develop a formalism for describing this process and
apply this formalism to derive a number of algorithms with a range of
observational applications. These include algorithms for forming arbitrarily
pointed tied-array beams from the regularly spaced Fourier-transform formed
beams, sculpting the beams to suppress sidelobes while only losing
percent-level sensitivity, and optimally estimating the position of a detected
source from its observed brightness in the set of beams. We also discuss the
effect that correlations in the visibility-space noise, due to cross-talk and
sky contributions, have on the optimality of Fourier transform beamforming,
showing that it does not strictly preserve the sky information of the $n^2$
correlation, even for an idealized array. Our results have applications to a
number of upcoming interferometers, in particular the Canadian Hydrogen

require a centralized powerful control center and a two-way communication
network between the system operators and energy end-users. The increasing user
participation in smart grids may limit their applications. In this paper, a
distributed solution for load management in emerging smart grids is proposed.
The load management problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem
aiming at maximizing the overall utility of users while meeting the requirement
for load reduction requested by the system operator, and is solved by using a
distributed dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm is implemented via a
distributed framework and thus can deliver a highly desired distributed
solution. It avoids the required use of a centralized coordinator or control
center, and can achieve satisfactory outcomes for load management. Simulation
results with various test systems demonstrate its effectiveness.

response, or the faster a system reaches the steady-state after the
introduction of the change, the smaller will be the output variability. In lean
manufacturing, the principle of reducing set-up times has the same purpose:
reduce the transient time and improve production flow. Analogously, the
analysis of the transient response of project-driven systems may provide
crucial information about how fast these systems react to a change and how that
change affects their production output. Although some studies have investigated
flow variability in projects, few have looked at variability from the
perspective that the transient state represents the changeovers on
project-driven production systems and how the transient state affects the
process' flow variability. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
effect of changes in project-driven production systems from a conceptual point
of view, furthermore, measuring and correlating the transient response of five
cases to their flow variability. Results showed a proportional relationship
between the percentile transient time and flow variability of a process. That
means that the quicker the production system reacts to change; the less the
distress in the production output, consequently, lower levels of flow
variability. As practical implications, lean practices focusing on reducing
set-up times (transient time) can have their effects measured on project-driven
production flow.

analysis of massive graphs. There is a large literature on graph sampling,
where the goal is to estimate properties (especially the degree distribution)
of a large graph through a small, random sample. The degree distribution
estimation poses a significant challenge, due to its heavy-tailed nature and
the large variance in degrees.
  We design a new algorithm, SADDLES, for this problem, using recent
mathematical techniques from the field of sublinear algorithms. The SADDLES
algorithm gives provably accurate outputs for all values of the degree
distribution. For the analysis, we define two fatness measures of the degree
distribution, called the $h$-index and the $z$-index. We prove that SADDLES is
sublinear in the graph size when these indices are large. A corollary of this
result is a provably sublinear algorithm for any degree distribution bounded
below by a power law.
  We deploy our new algorithm on a variety of real datasets and demonstrate its
excellent empirical behavior. In all instances, we get extremely accurate
approximations for all values in the degree distribution by observing at most
$1\%$ of the vertices. This is a major improvement over the state-of-the-art
sampling algorithms, which typically sample more than $10\%$ of the vertices to
give comparable results. We also observe that the $h$ and $z$-indices of real
graphs are large, validating our theoretical analysis.

films. In this work, we have studied the effect of microstructure by comparing
the NiCo2O4 epitaxial films grown on MgAl2O4 (111) and on Al2O3 (0001)
substrates. Although the optimal growth condition and the magnetic properties
are similar for the NiCo2O4/MgAl2O4 and the NiCo2O4/Al2O3, they show metallic

temperature and field dependence of magnetization, the NiCo2O4/Al2O3 show much
larger magnetoresistance at low temperature. Post-growth annealing decreases
the resistivity of NiCo2O4/Al2O3, but the annealed films are still
semiconducting. The correlation between the structural correlation length and
the resistivity suggests that the microstructural disorder, generated by the
dramatic mismatch between the NiCo2O4 and Al2O3 crystal structures, may be the
origin of the absence of the metallic electrical transport in NiCo2O4. These
results reveal microstructural disorder as another key factor in controlling
the electrical transport of NiCo2O4, with potentially large magnetoresistance

optical spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey. We present resolution-matched maps
of the star formation rate and molecular gas mass. These data are used to
calculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fraction ($f_{\rm~gas}$)
for these galaxies separately in the central `bulge' regions and outer disks.
We find that, for the two galaxies whose global specific star formation rate
(sSFR) deviates most from the star formation main sequence, the gas fraction in
the bulges is significantly lower than that in their disks, supporting an
`inside-out' model of galaxy quenching. For the two galaxies where SFE can be
reliably determined in the central regions, the bulges and disks share similar
SFEs. This suggests that a decline in $f_{\rm~gas}$ is the main driver of
lowered sSFR in bulges compared to disks in green valley galaxies. Within the
disks, there exist common correlations between the sSFR and SFE and between
sSFR and $f_{\rm~gas}$ on kpc scales -- the local SFE or $f_{\rm~gas}$ in the
disks declines with local sSFR. Our results support a picture in which the sSFR
in bulges is primarily controlled by $f_{\rm~gas}$, whereas both SFE and
$f_{\rm~gas}$ play a role in lowering the sSFR in disks. A larger sample is
required to confirm if the trend established in this work is representative of
green valley as a whole.

the next step location and timing are decided consistent with the commanded
walking velocity and based on the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM)

switching contact location and time. Then, consistent with the first stage, the
LIPM with flywheel dynamics is used to regenerate the DCM and angular momentum
trajectories at each control cycle. This is done by modulating the CoP and
Centroidal Momentum Pivot (CMP) to realize a desired DCM at the end of current

robust and dynamically consistent walking patterns.

QMF-NK1S, QMF-NK2S, and QMF-NK3S parameter sets, whose single $\Xi$ potentials
are $-12$ MeV. These results and those from cluster models with the Gaussian

an explanation mechanism using gradient-weighted class activation mapping that
isolates the visual symptoms used by the model to make predictions. This
unsupervised identification of unique visual symptoms for each stress provides
a quantitative measure of stress severity, allowing for identification,
classification and quantification in one framework. The learnt model appears to
be agnostic to species and make good predictions for other (non-soybean)
species, demonstrating an ability of transfer learning.

  Each ChemCam passive sky observation acquires spectra at two different

scattering radiative transfer model, using the correlated-k approximation for
gas absorption bands. The retrieval proceeds by first fitting the continuum of
the ratio of the two elevation angles to solve for aerosol properties, and then
fitting the continuum-removed ratio to solve for gas abundances. The final step
of the retrieval makes use of the observed CO2 absorptions and the known CO2
abundance to correct the retrieved water vapor abundance for the effects of the
vertical distribution of scattering aerosols and to derive an aerosol scale
height parameter.
  The ChemCam-retrieved water abundances show, with only a few exceptions, the
same seasonal behavior and the same timing of seasonal minima and maxima as the
TES, CRISM, and REMS-H data sets that we compare them to. However
ChemCam-retrieved water abundances are generally lower than zonal and regional
scale from-orbit water vapor data, while at the same time being significantly
larger than pre-dawn REMS-H abundances. Pending further analysis of REMS-H
volume mixing ratio uncertainties, the differences between ChemCam and REMS-H
pre-dawn mixing ratios appear to be much too large to be explained by large
scale circulations and thus they tend to support the hypothesis of substantial
diurnal interactions of water vapor with the surface. Our preliminary aerosol
results, meanwhile, show the expected seasonal pattern in dust particle size

solitons have on the overall optical field dynamics. Upon numerical
computation, we observe the appearance of Kuznetsov-Ma (KM) soliton trains in
the unbroken PT-phase when the initial Peregrine solitons are in phase. In the
out of phase condition, it shows repulsive nonlinear waves. Quite
interestingly, our study shows that within a specific range of the interval
factor in the transverse coordinate there exists a string of high intensity
well-localized Peregrine rogue waves in the PT unbroken phase. We note that the
interval factor as well as the transverse shift parameter play important roles
in the nonlinear interaction and evolution dynamics of the optical fields. This

function of temperature of the organic charge-transfer salt
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl. We identify anomalous features at $T_g
\approx\,63$ K which can be assigned to a kinetic glass-like ordering
transition. By determining the activation energy $E_A$, this glass-like
transition can be related to conformational degrees of freedom of the ethylene
endgroups of the organic building block BEDT-TTF. As opposed to other
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ salts, we identify a peculiar ethylene endgroup
ordering in the present material in which only one of the two
crystallographically inequivalent ethylene endgroups is subject to glass-like
ordering. This experimental finding is fully consistent with our predictions
from $ab\,initio$ calculations from which we estimate the energy differences
$\Delta E$ and the activation energies $E_A$ between different conformations.
The present results indicate that the specific interaction between the ethylene
endgroups and the nearby anion layers leads to different energetics of the
inequivalent ethylene endgroups, as evidenced by different ratios $E_A/\Delta
E$. We infer that the ratio $E_A/\Delta E$ is a suitable parameter to identify
the tendency of ethylene endgroups towards glass-like freezing.

spinning particle which won't move along a timelike geodesic into our

a Kerr-Sen black hole which is slightly different from Kerr black hole can be
used to accelerate a spinning particle to arbitrarily high energy. We found
that when one of the two colliding particles satisfies a critical relation
between the energy $E$ and the total angular momentum $J$, or has a critical
spinning angular momentum $s_c$, a divergence of the center-of-mass energy

Matrix (SHM), which is widely used in the discrete, limited order orthogonal
representation of sound fields. SHM's has been widely used in the audio
applications like spatial sound reproduction using loudspeakers, orthogonal
representation of Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) etc. The conditioning
behaviour of the SHM depends on the sampling positions chosen in the 3D space.
Identification of the optimal sampling points in the continuous 3D space that
results in a well-conditioned SHM for any number of sampling points is a highly
challenging task. In this work, an attempt has been made to solve a discrete
version of the above problem using optimization based techniques. The discrete
problem is, to identify the optimal sampling points from a discrete set of
densely sampled positions of the 3D space, that minimizes the condition number
of SHM. This method has been subsequently utilized for identifying the geometry
of loudspeakers in the spatial sound reproduction, and in the selection of
spatial sampling configurations for HRTF measurement. The application specific
requirements have been formulated as additional constraints of the optimization
problem. Recently developed mixed-integer optimization solvers have been used
in solving the formulated problem. The performance of the obtained sampling
position in each application is compared with the existing configurations.
Objective measures like condition number, D-measure, and spectral distortion
are used to study the performance of the sampling configurations resulting from
the proposed and the existing methods. It is observed that the proposed
solution is able to find the sampling points that results in a better
conditioned SHM and also maintains all the application specific requirements.

build a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on
quantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of

on the results of more than 30-year studies on lysosome, which can be used to
explain some facts but still remains incomplete and controversial. Based on
recently published papers and our related data it is possible that the key CQ

probably mainly due to the alteration in the CQ target protein or certain

Microscopically, we model the kinetics via antiferromagnetic Ising model with
Kawasaki spin-exchange kinetics. This conserves the composition while the
order-parameter (staggered magnetization) is not conserved. The order-parameter
correlation function and structure factor show dynamical scaling, and the
scaling functions are independent of the mixture composition. The average
domain size shows a power-law growth: $L_\sigma(t)\sim t^\alpha$. The
asymptotic growth regime has $\alpha=1/2$, though there can be prolonged
transients with $\alpha<1/2$ for asymmetric mixtures. Our unambiguous
observation of the asymptotic universal regime is facilitated by using an
accelerated Monte Carlo technique. We also obtain the coarse-grained free
energy from the Hamiltonian, as a function of two order-parameters. The
evolution of these order-parameters is modeled by using \textit{Model C}
kinetics. Similar to the microscopic dynamics, the average domain size of the
nonconserved order-parameter (staggered magnetization) field exhibits a
power-law growth: $L_m(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ at later times, irrespective of the mean
value of the conserved order-parameter (composition) field.

solvers can sometimes solve it automatically. However, they employ powerful
quantifier instantiation methods that may diverge, especially when $\varphi$ is
not preserved. A notable difficulty arises due to counterexamples of infinite
size.
  This paper studies Bounded-Horizon instantiation, a natural method for
guaranteeing the termination of SMT solvers. The method bounds the depth of
terms used in the quantifier instantiation process. We show that this method is
surprisingly powerful for checking quantified invariants in uninterpreted
domains. Furthermore, by producing partial models it can help the user diagnose
the case when $\varphi$ is not inductive, especially when the underlying reason
is the existence of infinite counterexamples.
  Our main technical result is that Bounded-Horizon is at least as powerful as
instrumentation, which is a manual method to guarantee convergence of the
solver by modifying the program so that it admits a purely universal invariant.
We show that with a bound of 1 we can simulate a natural class of
instrumentations, without the need to modify the code and in a fully automatic
way. We also report on a prototype implementation on top of Z3, which we used

of such a 5G network architecture to provide the state estimate of an
underlying linear system from the input obtained via large-scale deployment of
measurement devices. Assuming that the measurements are communicated via
densely deployed cloud radio access network (C-RAN), we formulate and solve the
problem of estimating the system state from the set of signals collected at
C-RAN base stations. Our solution, based on the Gaussian Belief-Propagation
(GBP) framework, allows for large-scale and distributed deployment within the
emerging 5G information processing architectures. The presented numerical study
demonstrates the accuracy, convergence behavior and scalability of the proposed
GBP-based solution to the large-scale state estimation problem.

station for the time transfer based on bidirectional time division multiplexing
transmission over a single fiber with the same wavelength (BTDM-SFSW). Along
the main fiber link, the forward and backward time signals alternatively pass
through the same OEO repeater via a 2X2 optical switch (OS). By this means, the
optical powers of bidirectional time signals increase. And parts of excess
noises, suffered from the main link, are sufficiently blocked owing to the OEO
process. Simultaneously, the bidirectional time signals can be decoded and
utilized for multi-access time transfer. As a result of the same devices for
both directions, the maximum delay symmetry is maintained, and the performance
for multi-access time transfer is guaranteed. With the OEO repeater stations,
we successfully demonstrate multi-access time transfer in our time transfer
testbeds with the main links up to 13,200 km. The time deviations of less than
80 ps/s and 11 ps/10^5 s, respectively, are obtained. Furthermore, the combined
standard uncertainties of less than 70 ps are reached, which agree well with
the experimental verifications over non-calibrated fiber links.

anticipate and avoid their potential failure. Thus wind turbine health is
commonly assessed monitoring series of $10$-minute SCADA and high frequency
data from sensors. To monitor wind turbine vibrations, normal behaviour models
are built to predict tower top accelerations and drive-train vibrations. Signal
deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further
investigated. More efficient models are expected to help enhancing the
identification of abnormal behaviour. In this paper we assess a stochastic
approach to reconstruct the $1$ Hz tower top acceleration signal, which was
measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German
North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model
based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining
algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. In order to focus the
discussion on the similarities and differences of both approaches, we limit our
evaluation to a single input-output system; in doing so, we avoid other
differences, i.e. loading type, pre-processing or model complexity. Our results
present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in
the high frequency domain ($1$ Hz). Although neural network retrieve accurate
step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach
predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the
original signal, remaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our
stochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted
for other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our
findings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal
reconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.

recently shown that one can implement sequentially any device, either channel

that this can be done, apart from some special cases, only when the succeeding
device is implemented on a larger system than just the input system. This means
that some part of the still available quantum information has been flown to the
environment and cannot be gathered by accessing the input system only. We
characterize the size of the post-measurement system by determining the class
of measurements for the observable in question that allow the subsequent
realization of any measurement process compatible with the said observable. We
also study the class of measurements that allow the subsequent realization of
any observable jointly measurable with the first one and show that these two

approach being proposed simultaneously examines the growth processes of the
co-authorship and citation networks by analyzing the evolutions of the rich get
richer and the fit get richer phenomena. In particular, the preferential
attachment function and author fitnesses, which govern the two phenomena, are
estimated non-parametrically in each network. The approach is applied to the
co-authorship and citation networks of the flagship journal of the strategic
management scientific community, namely the Strategic Management Journal. The
results suggest that the abovementioned phenomena have been consistently
governing both temporal networks. The average of the attachment exponents in
the co-authorship network is 0.30 while it is 0.29 in the citation network.
This suggests that the rich get richer phenomenon has been weak in both
networks. The right tails of the distributions of author fitness in both
networks are heavy, which imply that the intrinsic scientific quality of each
author has been playing a crucial role in getting new citations and new
co-authorships. Since the total competitiveness in each temporal network is
founded to be rising with time, it is getting harder to receive a new citation
or to develop a new collaboration. Analyzing the average competency, it was
found that on average, while the veterans tend to be more competent at
developing new collaborations, the newcomers are likely better at acquiring new
citations. Furthermore, the author fitness in both networks has been consistent
with the history of the strategic management scientific community. This
suggests that coupling node fitnesses throughout different networks might be a

self-consistent manner as a progenitor of the over-luminous type-Ia supernovae.
We compute static equilibria of white dwarf stars containing a strong magnetic
field and present the modification of white dwarf mass-radius relation caused
by the magnetic field. From a static equilibrium study, we find that a maximum
white dwarf mass of about 1.9 M$_\odot$ may be supported if the interior
poloidal field is as strong as approximately $10^{10}$ T. On the other hand if
the field is purely toroidal the maximum mass can be more than 5 M$_\odot$. All
these modifications are mainly from the presence of Lorenz force. The effects
of i) modification of equation of state due to Landau quantization, ii)
electrostatic interaction due to ions, iii) general relativistic calculation on
the stellar structure and, iv) field geometry are also considered. These
strongly magnetised configurations are sensitive to magnetic instabilities
where the perturbations grow at the corresponding Alfven time scales.

strengths of the nonlinearity and dispersion in the LF component. The complex
HF field is governed by the linear Schr\""odinger equation with a potential
generated by the real LF component, which, in turn, is governed by the KdV
equation including the ponderomotive coupling term, representing the feedback
of the HF field onto the LF component. First, we study the evolution of
pulse-shaped pulses by means of direct simulations. In the case when the
dispersion of the LF component is weak in comparison to its nonlinearity, the
input gives rise to several solitons in which the HF component is much broader
than its LF counterpart. In the opposite case, the system creates a single
soliton with approximately equal widths of both components. Collisions between
stable solitons are studied too, with a conclusion that the collisions are
inelastic, with a greater soliton getting still stronger, and the smaller one
suffering further attenuation. Robust intrinsic modes are excited in the
colliding solitons. A new family of approximate analytical two-component
soliton solutions with two free parameters is found for an arbitrary relative
strength of the nonlinearity and dispersion of the LF component, assuming weak
feedback of the HF field onto the LF component. Further, a one-parameter
(non-generic) family of exact bright-soliton solutions, with mutually
proportional HF and LF components, is produced too. Intrinsic dynamics of the
two-component solitons, induced by a shift of their HF component against the LF
one, is also studied, by means of numerical simulations, demonstrating

presence of a nonthermal pressure component required to sustain gravity in the
cluster outskirts of Abell 2142, that amounts to about 30% of the total
pressure at the virial radius. The presence of the nonthermal component implies
the gas fraction to be consistent with the universal value at the virial radius

inferred from the SZ data. Our results indicate that the presence of gas
clumping and of a nonthermal pressure component are both necessary to recover
the observed physical properties in the cluster outskirts. Moreover, we stress

hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$ there exists a constant $\varepsilon =

contains a clique or an independent set of size $|V(G)|^\varepsilon$. Recently,
there has been a growing interest in the symmetrized variant of this
conjecture, where one additionally requires $\mathcal{G}$ to be closed under
complementation.
  We show that any hereditary graph class that is closed under complementation
and excludes a fixed caterpillar as an induced subgraph satisfies the
Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture. Here, a caterpillar is a tree whose vertices of
degree at least three lie on a single path (i.e., our caterpillars may have
arbitrarily long legs). In fact, we prove a stronger property of such graph
classes, called in the literature the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property: for
every such graph class $\mathcal{G}$, there exists a constant $\delta =

result significantly extends the family of graph classes for which we know that

Carnot efficiency cannot be surpassed, and coherence can be performance
degrading in certain conditions, it was recently predicted that even when using
only thermal resources, internal coherence can enable a quantum heat engine to
produce more power than any classical heat engine using the same resources.
Such a power boost therefore constitutes a quantum thermodynamic signature. It
has also been shown that the presence of coherence results in the thermodynamic
equivalence of different quantum heat engine types, an effect with no classical
counterpart. Microscopic heat machines have been recently implemented with
trapped ions, and proposals for heat machines using superconducting circuits
and optomechanics have been made. When operated with standard thermal baths,
however, the machines implemented so far have not demonstrated any inherently
quantum feature in their thermodynamic quantities. Here we implement two types
of quantum heat engines by use of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres in
diamond, and experimentally demonstrate both the coherence power boost and the
equivalence of different heat-engine types. This constitutes the first

accretion driven by magnetic winds. The required surface densities are a
natural result of the protostellar infall phase, as long as non-gravitational

that in a $\kappa$ window around 0.6, a region with the (gapped $Z_2$)

an important role. We use a screened Coulomb disorder to model the charged
impurities, and study the magneto-transport in a two-node Weyl semimetal. It is
found that when the external magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric
field, the calculated longitudinal magnetoconductivity shows positive in the
magnetic field, which is just the negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity
(LMR) observed in experiments. When the two fields are perpendicular to each
other, the transverse magnetoconductivities are measured. It is found that the
longitudinal (transverse) magnetoconductivity is suppressed (enhanced)
sensitively with increasing the screening length. This feature makes it hardly
to observe the negative LMR in Weyl semimetals experimentally owing to a small
screening length. Our findings gain insight into further understanding on
recently actively debated magneto-transport behaviors in Weyl semimetals.
Furthermore we studied the relative weight of the inter-valley scattering and
the intra-valley scattering. It shows that the former is as important as the
latter and even dominates in the case of strong magnetic fields and small

classifier- specific competence and cross-competence measures, which estimates

the method of obtaining confusion matrices. The first one is aimed to deal with
imbalanced labels. The other utilizes double labelled instances which are
usually removed during the pairwise transformation. The proposed methods were
evaluated using 29 benchmark datasets. In order to assess the efficiency of the
introduced models, they were compared against 1 state-of-the-art approach and
the correction scheme based on the original method of confusion matrix
estimation. The comparison was performed using four different multi-label
evaluation measures: macro and micro-averaged F1 loss, zero-one loss and
Hamming loss. Additionally, we investigated relations between classification
quality, which is expressed in terms of different quality criteria, and
characteristics of multi-label datasets such as average imbalance ratio or
label density. The experimental study reveals that the correction approaches
significantly outperforms the reference method only in terms of zero-one loss.

environments are the natural path to get the best of the on-premise and cloud
resources---steady (and sensitive) workloads can run on on-premise resources
and peak demand can leverage remote resources in a pay-as-you-go manner.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of questions to be answered in HPC cloud, which
range from how to extract the best performance of an unknown underlying
platform to what services are essential to make its usage easier. Moreover, the
discussion on the right pricing and contractual models to fit small and large

fabrication of nanoscale devices and structures. For this technique to be
effective, the resist material plays a key role and must have high resolution,
reasonable sensitivity and high etch selectivity against the conventional
silicon substrate or underlayer film. In this work, the lithographic
performance of two high etch resistance materials was evaluated: ZEP520A
(Nippon Zeon Co.) and mr-PosEBR (micro resist technology GmbH). Both materials
are positive tone, polymer-based and non-chemically amplified resists. Two
exposure techniques were used: electron beam lithography (EBL) and extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. These resists were originally designed for EBL
patterning, where high quality patterning at sub-100 nm resolution was
previously demonstrated. In the scope of this work, we also aim to validate
their extendibility to EUV for high resolution and large area patterning. To
this purpose, the same EBL process conditions were employed at EUV. The figures
of merit, i.e. dose to clear, dose to size, and resolution, were extracted and
these results are discussed systematically. It was found that both materials
are very fast at EUV (dose to clear lower than 12 mJ/cm2) and are capable of
resolving dense lines/space arrays with a resolution of 25 nm half-pitch. The
quality of patterns was also very good and the sidewall roughness was below 6
nm. Interestingly, the general-purpose process used for EBL can be extended
straightforwardly to EUV lithography with comparable high quality and yield.
Our findings open new possibilities for lithographers who wish to devise novel
fabrication schemes exploiting EUV for fabrication of nanostructures by deep
etch pattern transfer.

change. Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the
capability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different
temporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the
same as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal
scales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens
of kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2
needs to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which
it can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales
involved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally
unfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine
means that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and
depth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represents a
better strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer
systems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock
formations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In
particular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic
geology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable
layers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in
terms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer
systems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations
for multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage
between individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a
state-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model.

dimensional small-world networks with different shortcut densities $\phi$ where
$\phi=0$ and $1$ represent a regular lattice and a random network respectively.
In the small-world regime ($2^{-12} \le \phi \le 0.1$), the critical behaviour
of the model is explored studying different geometrical properties of the
avalanches as a function of avalanche size $s$. For both the dimensions, three
regions of $s$, separated by two crossover sizes $s_1$ and $s_2$ ($s_1<s_2$),
are identified analyzing the scaling behaviour of average height and area of
the toppling surface associated with an avalanche. It is found that avalanches
of size $s<s_1$ are compact and follow Manna scaling on the regular lattice
whereas the avalanches with size $s>s_1$ are sparse as they are on network and
follow mean-field scaling. Coexistence of different scaling forms in the
small-world regime leads to violation of usual finite-size scaling, in contrary
to the fact that the model follows the same on the regular lattice as well as
on the random network independently. Simultaneous appearance of multiple
scaling forms are characterized by developing a coexistence scaling theory. As
SWN evolves from regular lattice to random network, a crossover from diffusive
to super-diffusive nature of sand transport is observed and scaling forms of
such crossover is developed and verified.

oscillates with a frequency $\Delta k_F$ ($2\Delta k_F$). Here $\Delta

observed in recent numerical work on this model. These singular peaks in
momentum space together with the spatial oscillation suggest an analog of the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in the 1D Hubbard model. The
parameter $\beta$ representing the lattice effect becomes prominent in critical
exponents which determine the power-law decay of all correlation functions. We

theories in terms of worldlines and worldsheets. In particular we focus on a
strategy which is applicable also to non-abelian theories: traces and
matrix/vector products are written as explicit sums over color indices and a
dual variable is introduced for each individual term. These dual variables
correspond to fluxes in both, space-time and color for matter fields (Abelian
color fluxes), or to fluxes in color space around space-time plaquettes for
gauge fields (Abelian color cycles). Subsequently all original degrees of
freedom, i.e., matter fields and gauge links, can be integrated out.
Integrating over complex phases of matter fields gives rise to constraints that
enforce conservation of matter flux on all sites. Integrating out phases of
gauge fields enforces vanishing combined flux of matter- and gauge degrees of
freedom. The constraints give rise to a system of worldlines and worldsheets.
Integrating over the factors that are not phases (e.g., radial degrees of
freedom or contributions from the Haar measure) generates additional weight
factors that together with the constraints implement the full symmetry of the
conventional formulation, now in the language of worldlines and worldsheets. We
discuss the Abelian color flux and Abelian color cycle strategies for three
examples: the SU(2) principal chiral model with chemical potential coupled to
two of the Noether charges, SU(2) lattice gauge theory coupled to staggered
fermions, as well as full lattice QCD with staggered fermions. For the
principal chiral model we present some simulation results that illustrate
properties of the worldline dynamics at finite chemical potentials.

distributions and estimate the KW GRB detection horizon, which extends to z ~
16.6, stressing the importance of GRBs as probes of the early Universe.
Accounting for the instrumental bias, we estimate the KW GRB luminosity
evolution, luminosity and isotropic-energy functions, and the evolution of the

which consists in minimizing a sequence of convex surrogate functionals. MM
approaches have been particularly successful to tackle inverse problems and
statistical machine learning problems where the regularization term is a
sparsity-promoting concave function. However, due to non-convexity, the
solution found by MM depends on its initialization. Uniform initialization is
the most natural and often employed strategy as it boils down to penalizing all
coefficients equally in the first MM iteration. Yet, this arbitrary choice can
lead to unsatisfactory results in severely under-determined inverse problems
such as source imaging with magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG). The
framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is an alternative approach to
encode sparsity. This work shows that for certain hierarchical models, a simple
alternating scheme to compute fully Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimates leads to the exact same sequence of updates as a standard MM strategy
(cf. the Adaptive Lasso). With this parallel outlined, we show how to improve
upon these MM techniques by probing the multimodal posterior density using
Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Firstly, we show that these samples
can provide well-informed initializations that help MM schemes to reach better
local minima. Secondly, we demonstrate how it can reveal the different modes of
the posterior distribution in order to explore and quantify the inherent
uncertainty and ambiguity of such ill-posed inference procedure. In the context
of M/EEG, each mode corresponds to a plausible configuration of neural sources,
which is crucial for data interpretation, especially in clinical contexts.
Results on both simulations and real datasets show how the number or the type
of sensors affect the uncertainties on the estimates.

  with Limited Overlap",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating causal effects with propensity scores relies upon the availability
of treated and untreated units observed at each value of the estimated
propensity score. In settings with strong confounding, limited so-called
""overlap"" in propensity score distributions can undermine the empirical basis
for estimating causal effects and yield erratic finite-sample performance of
existing estimators. We propose a Bayesian procedure designed to estimate
causal effects in settings where there is limited overlap in propensity score
distributions. Our method relies on the posterior predictive treatment
assignment (PPTA), a quantity that is derived from the propensity score but
serves different role in estimation of causal effects. We use the PPTA to
estimate causal effects by marginalizing over the uncertainty in whether each
observation is a member of an unknown subset for which treatment assignment can
be assumed unconfounded. The resulting posterior distribution depends on the
empirical basis for estimating a causal effect for each observation and has
commonalities with recently-proposed ""overlap weights"" of Li et al. (2016). We
show that the PPTA approach can be construed as a stochastic version of
existing ad-hoc approaches such as pruning based on the propensity score or
truncation of inverse probability of treatment weights, and highlight several
practical advantages including uncertainty quantification and improved
finite-sample performance. We illustrate the method in an evaluation of the
effectiveness of technologies for reducing harmful pollution emissions from
power plants in the United States.

distributed control of discrete-event systems (DES) with finite behavior. Its
essence is the allocation of monolithic (global) control action among the local
control strategies of individual agents. In this report, we extend supervisor
localization to study the distributed control of DES with infinite behavior.
Specifically, we first employ Thistle and Wonham's supervisory control theory
for DES with infinite behavior to compute a safety supervisor (for safety
specifications) and a liveness supervisor (for liveness specifications), and
then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the safety
supervisor into a set of safety local controllers, one for each controllable
event, and decompose the liveness supervisor into a set of liveness local
controllers, two for each controllable event. The localization procedure for
decomposing the liveness supervisor is novel; in particular, a local controller
is responsible for disabling the corresponding controllable event on only part
of the states of the liveness supervisor, and consequently, the derived local
controller in general has states number no more than that computed by
considering the disablement on all the states. Moreover, we prove that the
derived local controllers achieve the same controlled behavior with the safety
and liveness supervisors. We finally illustrate the result by a Small Factory
example.

walls drive the shuttle streaming of the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic flows underlie
the reorganization of the network for example by movement toward attractive

direction by an applied electric field, as has recently been demonstrated by
Park, et al. [Angewandte Chemie {\bf 129}, 1066 (2017)]. The trapped molecules
are prepared into a state which has its electron spin perpendicular to
$\hat{\rm{z}}$, and a magnetic field along $\hat{\rm{z}}$ causes precession of
this spin. An electron electric dipole moment $d_e$ would affect this
precession due to the up to 100~GV/cm effective electric field produced by the
polar molecule. The large number of polar molecules that can be embedded in a
matrix, along with the expected long coherence times for the precession, allows
for the possibility of measuring $d_e$ to an accuracy that surpasses current
measurements by many orders of magnitude. Because the matrix can inhibit
molecular rotations and lock the orientation of the polar molecules, it may not
be necessary to have an electric field present during the precession. The
proposed technique can be applied using a variety of polar molecules and inert
gases, which, along with other experimental variables, should allow for careful
study of systematic uncertainties in the measurement.

devices that must wirelessly transmit, in near real-time, a diverse set of

to support such coexistent, heterogeneous communication is hence a key IoT
challenge. In particular, there is a need for self-organizing resource
allocation solutions that can account for unique IoT features, such as massive
scale and stringent resource constraints. In this paper, a novel finite memory
multi-state sequential learning framework is proposed to enable diverse IoT
devices to share limited communication resources, while transmitting both
delay-tolerant, periodic messages and urgent, critical messages. The proposed
learning framework enables the IoT devices to learn the number of critical
messages and to reallocate the communication resources for the periodic
messages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed
learning framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of
memory and computational capabilities. The convergence of the proposed learning
framework is proved, and the lowest expected delay that the IoT devices can
achieve using this learning framework is derived. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm in IoT networks with different
delay targets, network densities, probabilities of detection, and memory sizes
is analyzed in terms of the probability of a successful random access request
and percentage of devices that learned correctly. The results show that the
proposed learning algorithm is very effective in reducing the delay of urgent,
critical messages by intelligently reallocating the communication resources
allocated to the delay-tolerant, periodic messages.

the TGSS survey, allowing us to check consistency of the radio dipole at low

We match the flux thresholds of the catalogues, with flux limits chosen to
minimise systematics, and adopt a strict masking scheme. We find dipole
directions that are in good agreement with each other and with the CMB dipole.
In order to compare the amplitude of the dipoles with theoretical predictions,
we produce sets of lognormal realisations. Our realisations include the
theoretical kinematic dipole, galaxy clustering, Poisson noise, simulated
redshift distributions which fit the NVSS and TGSS source counts, and errors in

predicted by the mock data. For TGSS, the dipole is almost $\sim\! 5$ times

theory can be established, where we exploit the fact that due to the finite

finite population of wild types. For a fixed-size community of $N$ individuals,
with Markovian, zero-sum dynamics driven by stochastic birth-death events, the
mutant population eventually reaches either fixation or extinction. The
classical analysis, provided by Kimura and his coworkers, is focused on the
neutral case, [where the dynamics is only due to demographic stochasticity
(drift)], and on \emph{time-independent} selective forces
(deleterious/beneficial mutation). However, both theoretical arguments and
empirical analyses suggest that in many cases the selective forces fluctuate in
time (temporal environmental stochasticity). Here we consider a generic model
for a system with demographic noise and fluctuating selection. Our system is
characterized by the time-averaged (log)-fitness $s_0$ and zero-mean fitness
fluctuations. These fluctuations, in turn, are parameterized by their amplitude
$\gamma$ and their correlation time $\delta$. We provide asymptotic (large $N$)

scenario: an algorithm starts exploring an undirected graph from some seed
node; the algorithm, for an arbitrary node $v$ that it is aware of, can ask an
oracle to return the set of the neighbors of $v$. (In social network analysis,
a call to this oracle corresponds to downloading the profile page of user $v$

nodes of the graph as possible. Motivated by practical applications, we study
the complexities of a variety of problems in terms of the graph's mixing time
and average degree -- two measures that are believed to be quite small in
real-world social networks, and that have often been used in the applied
literature to bound the performance of online exploration algorithms. Our main

gamma-ray burst, the GRB 170817A signal, was achieved independently by the
Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and by the Anti-coincidence Shield for the

by this near temporal and spatial concomitance of events, which can occur by
chance only with the probability $5.0 \, \times \, 10^{-8}$, we speculate on
the possibility that new dark stars signals could be detected from the
LIGO/VIRGO detectors. This proposal, which aims at providing a test for some
models of dark matter, relies on the recent achievement of detecting, for
visible ordinary matter, the merging of neutron stars both in the gravitational
and the electromagnetic channel. A lack of correlation between the two expected
signals would suggest a deviation from the properties of ordinary matter.
Specifically, we focus on models of invisible dark matter, and in particular we
study the case of mirror dark matter, within the framework of which a large
amount of mirror neutron stars are naturally envisaged to occupy our dark
matter halo. The observation of an electromagnetically hidden event inside the
dark matter halo of our galaxy should provide a hint of new physics. There
would be indeed no satisfactorily complete explanation accounting for the lack
of electromagnetic signal, if only standard neutron star merging were
considered to describe events that happen so close to us.

Distributed actions are totally independent and they do not depend on global

In the Ohmic case, incompressible current distribution in a sample adjusts fast
to a time-dependent voltage on the electrodes, while in the viscous case,
momentum diffusion makes for retardation and for the possibility of propagating
slow shear waves. We focus on specific geometries that showcase interesting
aspects of such waves: current parallel to a one-dimensional defect and current
applied across a long strip. We find that the phase velocity of the wave
propagating along the strip respectively increases/decreases with the frequency
for no-slip/no-stress boundary conditions. This is so because when the
frequency or strip width goes to zero (alternatively, viscosity go to
infinity), the wavelength of the current pattern tends to infinity in the
no-stress case and to a finite value in a general case. We also show that for
DC current across a strip with no-stress boundary, there only one pair of
vortices, while there is an infinite vortex chain for all other types of

periodically driven fields. However, such set-ups are not amenable to analysis
using simple, yet powerful, closed-form expressions of linearized
optomechanics, which have provided so much of our present understanding of
experimental optomechanics. In the present paper, we formulate a new method to
calculate quantum noise spectra in modulated optomechanical systems, which we
analyze, compare, and discuss with two other recently proposed solutions: we
term these (i) frequency-shifted operators (ii) Floquet and (iii) iterative
analysis. We prove that (i) and (ii) yield equivalent noise spectra, and find
that (iii) is an analytical approximation to (i) for weak modulations. We
calculate the noise spectra of a doubly-modulated system describing experiments
of levitated particles in hybrid electro-optical traps. We show excellent
agreement with Langevin stochastic simulations in the thermal regime and
predict squeezing in the quantum regime. Finally, we reveal how experimentally
inaccessible spectral components of a modulated system can be measured in
heterodyne detection through an appropriate choice of modulation frequencies.

alloys was investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics with optimized
Albe-Tersoff empirical interatomic potentials. Existing potentials for binary
AlAs, GaAs, and InAs were optimized to obtain accurate phonon dispersions and
temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal transport
in ternary III-Vs commonly employ the virtual-crystal approximation (VCA),
where the structure is assumed to be a random alloy and all group-III atoms
(cations) are treated as if they have an effective weighted-average mass. Here,
we showed that is critical to treat atomic masses explicitly, and that the
thermal conductivity obtained with explicit atomic masses differs considerably
from the value obtained with the average VCA cation mass. The larger the
difference between the cation masses, the poorer the VCA prediction for thermal
conductivity. The random-alloy assumption in the VCA is also challenged,
because X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show order in
InGaAs, InAlAs, and GaAlAs epi-layers. We calculated thermal conductivity for
three common types of order [CuPt-B, CuAu-I, and triple-period-A (TPA)] and
showed that the experimental results for In$_{0.53}$Ga$_{0.47}$As and
In$_{0.52}$Al$_{0.48}$As, which are lattice matched to the InP substrate, can
be reproduced in molecular dynamics simulation with 2% and 8% of random

from a disordered FCC to a mixture of disordered BCC and ordered B2 structures.
While the onset of BCC/B2 formation was consistent with previously reported
cast alloys, the FCC structure was observed at larger Al contents in the laser

primarily confined to the BCC/B2 grain boundaries at these high Al contents.
The nanoindentation modulus and hardness of the FCC phase increased with Al

plastic scintillator bars used as a detection material. The bars are grouped in
25 detector modules. The energy range sensitivity of POLAR is optimized to
match with the prompt emission photons from the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
Polarization measurements of the prompt emission would probe source geometries,
emission mechanisms and magnetic structures in GRB jets. The instrument can
also detect hard X-rays from solar flares and be used for precise measurement

conversion factors are related to Compton edge positions from the collinear
annihilation photons from the sources. This paper presents main principles of

visual recognition tasks. However, existing deep neural network models are
computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their deployment in
devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict latency
requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model compression and
acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing the model
performance. During the past five years, tremendous progress has been made in
this area. In this paper, we review the recent techniques for compacting and
accelerating DNN models. In general, these techniques are divided into four
categories: parameter pruning and quantization, low-rank factorization,
transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge distillation. Methods
of parameter pruning and quantization are described first, after that the other
techniques are introduced. For each category, we also provide insightful
analysis about the performance, related applications, advantages, and
drawbacks. Then we go through some very recent successful methods, for example,
dynamic capacity networks and stochastic depths networks. After that, we survey
the evaluation matrices, the main datasets used for evaluating the model
performance, and recent benchmark efforts. Finally, we conclude this paper,
discuss remaining the challenges and possible directions for future work.

for the conformation of a lipid vesicle in theoretical biophysics, which is
governed by the principle of energy minimization over configurations of
appropriate topological characteristics. We will show that the presence of a
quantity called the spontaneous curvature obstructs the existence of a
minimizer of the Helfrich energy over the set of embedded ring tori. Besides,
despite the well-realized knowledge that lipid vesicles may present themselves
in a variety of shapes of complicated topology, there is a lack of topological
bounds for the Helfrich energy. To overcome these difficulties, we consider a
general scale-invariant anisotropic curvature energy that extends the Canham
elastic bending energy developed in modeling a biconcave-shaped red blood cell.
We will show that, up to a rescaling of the generating radii, there is a unique
minimizer of the energy over the set of embedded ring tori, in the entire
parameter regime, which recovers the Willmore minimizer in its Canham isotropic
limit. We also show how elevated anisotropy favors energetically a clear
transition from spherical-, to ellipsoidal-, and then to biconcave-shaped
surfaces, for a lipid vesicle. We then establish some genus-dependent
topological lower and upper bounds for the anisotropic energy. Finally, we
derive the shape equation of the generalized bending energy, which extends the
well-known Helfrich shape equation.

predict that there are no excitonic or quasiparticle energy gaps for the $C2/c$

lower energy phonon frequency. Finally, we compare the nanolens against the
more usual dimer configuration, we find that the superior geometry depends
crucially on the material used, with noble metal nanolenses unlikely to offer
better performance to equivalent dimers. Interestingly SiC nanolenses can offer
a larger maximum field enhancement compared to the corresponding dimer
configuration, suggesting that future endeavours in constructing a nanolens

Poisson distribution of density fluctuations on very large scales $1/k > ct$ by
the motion of discrete particles over timescale $t$. The constraint is part of
what is sometimes referred to as the Zel'dovich bound. We investigate in this
paper the transport of energy by the propagation of waves emanating {\it
incoherently} from a regular and infinite lattice of oscillators, each having
the same finite amount of energy reserve initially. The model we employ does
not involve the expansion of the Universe -- the scales of interest are all
deeply sub-horizon -- but the size of regions over which perturbations are
evaluated far exceed $ct$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the start of
emission (it is assumed that $t$ greatly exceeds the duration of emission). We
find that to lowest order, when only wave fields $\propto 1/r$ are included,
there is exact compensation between the energy loss of the oscillators and the
energy emitted into space, which means $P(0)=0$ for the power spectrum of
density fluctuations on the largest scales. This is consistent with the
Zel'dovich bound. To the next order when near fields $\propto r^{-2}$ are
included, however, $P(0)$ settles at late times to a positive value that
depends only on time, as $t^{-2}$ (the same applies to an energy non-conserving
term). Even though this effect looks like superluminal energy transport, there
is no violation of causality because the two-point function vanishes completely
for $r>t$ if the emission of each oscillator is truncated beyond some duration.
The result calls to question any need of enlisting cosmic inflation to seed
large scale density perturbations. When applied to fast radio bursts --
uniformly distributed transients (to lowest order) that repeat at other
locations -- the result supports Hoyle's hypothesis of constant energy
injection.

Since the resources in the MeNB are shared by background legacy users and
foreground users, DC may increase the blocking probability of background users.

this exploratory study is to find out what benefits the privacy risk

Method: Therefore we apply STPA-Priv to a real world health scenario that
involves a smart glucose measurement device used by children. Different kinds
of data from the smart device including location data should be shared with the
parents, physicians, and urban planners. This makes it a sociotechnical system
that offers adequate and complex privacy risks to be found. Results: We find
out that STPA-Priv is a structured method for privacy analysis and finds
complex privacy risks. The method is supported by a tool called XSTAMPP which
makes the analysis and its results more profound. Additionally, we learn that
an iterative application of the steps might be necessary to find more privacy
risks when more information about the system is available later. Conclusions:
STPA-Priv helps to identify complex privacy risks that are derived from
sociotechnical interactions in a system. It also outputs privacy constraints
that are to be enforced by the system to ensure privacy.

limited by an intrinsic GHz threshold. Recently, an alternative research
direction has been initiated by realizing memory devices based on
antiferromagnets in which spin directions periodically alternate from one
atomic lattice site to the next. In our work we experimentally demonstrate at
room temperature that the speed of reversible electrical writing in a memory
device can be scaled up to THz using an antiferromagnet. Efficient
current-induced spin-torque mechanism is responsible for the switching in our
memory devices throughout the twelve orders of magnitude range of writing
speeds from Hz to THz. Our work opens the path towards the development of
memory-logic technology reaching the elusive THz band.

In this paper, we propose a bilayer heterojunction solar cell comprised of a
perovskite layer combining with a IV-VI group semiconductor layer, which can
give a conversion efficiency even higher than the conventional perovskite solar
cell. Such a scheme uses a property that the semiconductor layer with a direct
band gap can be better in absorption of long wavelength light and is
complementary to the perovskite layer. We studied the semiconducting layers
such as GeSe, SnSe, GeS, and SnS, respectively, and found that GeSe is the
best, where the optical absorption efficiency in the perovskite/GeSe solar cell
is dramatically increased. It turns out that the short circuit current density
is enhanced 100% and the power conversion efficiency is promoted 42.7% (to a
high value of 23.77%) larger than that in a solar cell with only single
perovskite layer. The power conversion efficiency can be further promoted so
long as the fill factor and open-circuit voltage are improved. This strategy
opens a new way on developing the solar cells with high performance and
practical applications.

The H-shaped device is based on a combination of transverse topological effects
involving the spin: the inverse spin Hall effect and the spin Nernst effect.
The device can convert a temperature drop in one arm into an electric power
output in the other arm. Analytical expressions for the output voltage, the
figure-of-merit (ZT) and energy converting efficiency are reported. We show
that the output voltage and the ZT can be tuned by the geometry of the device
and the physical properties of the material. Importantly, contrary to a
conventional thermoelectric device, here a low electric conductivity may in
fact enhance the ZT value, thereby opening a path to new strategies in
optimizing the figure-of-merit.

(BSO) algorithm has become a promising population-based evolutionary algorithm.
However, BSO is pointed out that it possesses a degenerated L-curve phenomenon,
i.e., it often gets near optimum quickly but needs much more cost to improve
the accuracy. To overcome this question in this paper, an excellent direct
search based local solver, the Nelder-Mead Simplex (NMS) method is adopted in
BSO. Through combining BSO's exploration ability and NMS's exploitation ability
together, a simplex search based BSO (Simplex-BSO) is developed via a better
balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Simplex-BSO is shown
to be able to eliminate the degenerated L-curve phenomenon on unimodal
functions, and alleviate significantly this phenomenon on multimodal functions.
Large number of experimental results show that Simplex-BSO is a promising
algorithm for global optimization problems.
