Gravity",,"10.1088/1361-6382/aaa7de",,"gr-qc hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent detections of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo
detectors open up new tests of modified gravity theories in the strong-field
and dynamical, extreme gravity regime. Such tests rely sensitively on the phase
evolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the
energy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four
different methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy
pseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or
tensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the
action under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field
equations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy
complex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem
in field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General
Relativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-\AE{}ther theory to find the
gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which
energy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy
tensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory are
presented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate
of energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally
different. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor
that is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante
procedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz
invariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory. The
methods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of
predictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with
observations.

where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for
generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution
(DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can
fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results
show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and
16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least
one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence
on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10
dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial
machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are
also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an
important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in
the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively
generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating
robustness.

smaller than the value necessary for reaching the bulk topological
superconducting phase. The two Majorana bound states can arise because locally
the wire is in the topological regime. We find three parameter ranges with
different spectral properties: crossings, anticrossings and asymptotic
reduction of the energy as a function of the applied Zeeman field.
Interestingly, all these cases have already been observed experimentally.
Moreover, since an increment of the magnetic field implies the increase of the
distance between the Majorana bound states, the amplitude of the energy
oscillations, when present, gets reduced. The existence of the different
Majorana scenarios crucially relies on the fact that the two Majorana bound
states have distinct $k$-space structures. We develop analytical models that

Specifically, we develop two formulations for applying dictionary learning to

prime X-ray source; however, their formation efficiency is not well understood.
Using $N$-body simulations, we estimate the HMXB formation rate via mutual
gravitational interactions of nascent, small groups of the Population~III
stars. We find that HMXBs form at a rate of one per $\gtrsim 10^{4}M_{\odot}$
in newly born stars, and that they emit with a power of $\sim 10^{41} {\rm
erg}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the $2-10$ keV band per star formation rate (SFR). This
value is a factor $\sim 10^{2}$ larger than what is observed in star forming
galaxies at lower redshifts; the X-ray production from early HMXBs would have
been even more copious, if they also formed \textit{in situ} or via migration
in protostellar disks. Combining our results with earlier studies suggests that
early HMXBs were highly effective at heating the IGM and leaving a strong 21 cm
signature. We discuss broader implications of our results, such as the rate of
long gamma-ray bursts from Population~III stars and the direct collapse channel
for massive black hole formation.

requirements by providing a compressed global state. Unlike previous
approaches, our distributed ledger solution provides an accountable revocation
mechanism without requiring trust in a single misbehavior authority, instead
allowing a collaborative and transparent decision making process through
Blackchain. This makes Blackchain an attractive alternative to existing
solutions for revocation in a Security Credential Management System (SCMS),
which suffer from the traditional disadvantages of PKIs, notably including
centralized trust. Our proposal becomes scalable through the use of
hierarchical consensus: individual vehicles dynamically create clusters, which
then provide their consensus decisions as input for road-side units (RSUs),
which in turn publish their results to misbehavior authorities. This authority,
which is traditionally a single entity in the SCMS, responsible for the
integrity of the entire V2X network, is now a set of authorities that
transparently perform a revocation, whose result is then published in a global
Blackchain state. This state can be used to prevent the issuance of
certificates to previously malicious users, and also prevents the authority
from misbehaving through the transparency implied by a global system state.

use of off-the-shelf physics engines and the adaptation of a Bayesian
optimization technique towards minimizing the number of real-world experiments
needed for model-based reinforcement learning. The proposed framework
reproduces in a physics engine experiments performed on a real robot and
optimizes the model's mechanical parameters so as to match real-world
trajectories. The optimized model is then used for learning a policy in
simulation, before real-world deployment. It is well understood, however, that
it is hard to exactly reproduce real trajectories in simulation. Moreover, a
near-optimal policy can be frequently found with an imperfect model. Therefore,
this work proposes a strategy for identifying a model that is just good enough
to approximate the value of a locally optimal policy with a certain confidence,
instead of wasting effort on identifying the most accurate model. Evaluations,
performed both in simulation and on a real robotic manipulation task, indicate
that the proposed strategy results in an overall time-efficient, integrated
model identification and learning solution, which significantly improves the
data-efficiency of existing policy search algorithms.

work of Brinkman and Charikar (2003). In fact, the above set $\mathcal{C}$ can
be taken to be the same set as the one that Brinkman and Charikar considered,
viewed as a collection of diagonal matrices in $\mathsf{S}_1$. The challenge is
to demonstrate that $\mathcal{C}$ cannot be faithfully realized in an arbitrary
low-dimensional subspace of $\mathsf{S}_1$, while Brinkman and Charikar
obtained such an assertion only for subspaces of $\mathsf{S}_1$ that consist of
diagonal operators (i.e., subspaces of $\ell_1$). We establish this by proving
that the Markov 2-convexity constant of any finite dimensional linear subspace

always been a great challenge, even with the recent development in deep neural
networks. The performance of a classic fault diagnosis system predominantly
depends on the features extracted and the classifier subsequently applied.
Although a large number of attempts have been made regarding feature extraction
techniques, the methods require great human involvements are heavily depend on
domain expertise and may thus be non-representative and biased from application
to application. On the other hand, while the deep neural networks based
approaches feature adaptive feature extractions and inherent classifications,
they usually require a substantial set of training data and thus hinder their
usage for engineering applications with limited training data such as gearbox
fault diagnosis. This paper develops a deep convolutional neural network-based
transfer learning approach that not only entertains pre-processing free
adaptive feature extractions, but also requires only a small set of training
data. The proposed approach performs gear fault diagnosis using pre-processing
free raw accelerometer data and experiments with various sizes of training data
were conducted. The superiority of the proposed approach is revealed by
comparing the performance with other methods such as locally trained
convolution neural network and angle-frequency analysis based support vector
machine. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is not only
viable and robust, but also has the potential to be readily applicable to other
fault diagnosis practices.

from a general relativistic framework, we obtain the set of equations

previously applied in the literature. We employ a multi-harmonic expansion to
solve the relativistic equation for the axion field in the star, and

proto-planetary discs in binaries has been little explored from the theoretical
side. In this paper we investigate the evolution of the discs surrounding the
primary and secondary components of binary systems on the assumption that this
is driven by photoevaporation induced by X-rays from the respective star. We
show how for close enough separations (20-30 AU for average X-ray luminosities)
the tidal torque of the companion changes the qualitative behaviour of disc
dispersal from inside out to outside in. Fewer transition discs created by
photoevaporation are thus expected in binaries. We also demonstrate that in
close binaries the reduction in viscous time leads to accelerated disc clearing
around both components, consistent with $\textit{unresolved}$ observations.
When looking at the $\textit{differential}$ disc evolution around the two
components, in close binaries discs around the secondary clear first due to the
shorter viscous timescale associated with the smaller outer radius. In wide
binaries instead the difference in photo-evaporation rate makes the secondaries
longer lived, though this is somewhat dependent on the assumed scaling of
viscosity with stellar mass. We find that our models are broadly compatible
with the growing sample of $\textit{resolved}$ observations of discs in
binaries. We also predict that binaries have higher accretion rates than single
stars for the same disc mass. Thus binaries probably contribute to the observed
scatter in the relationship between disc mass and accretion rate in young
stars.

eliminate known on-board and data processing artefacts, and present a
statistical method to identify sources that show transient brightness
variations on ~2 hours timescales. We illustrate that by using the Gaia
photometric CCD measurements, we can detect transient brightness variations
down to an amplitude of 0.3 mag on timescales ranging from 15 seconds to
several hours. We search an area of ~23.5 square degrees on the sky, and find
four strong candidate fast transients. Two candidates are tentatively
classified as flares on M-dwarf stars, while one is probably a flare on a giant

correlation functions of the form $\langle \hat{O}(t) \rangle$, even though
extensions to frequency-resolved response functions $\langle \hat{O}(t)
\hat{O}(0) \rangle$ would provide important information about the elementary
excitations in a many-body system. For example, single particle spectral
functions, which are usually measured using photoemission experiments in
electron systems, contain direct information about fractionalization and the
quasiparticle excitation spectrum. Here, we propose a measurement scheme to
experimentally access the momentum and energy resolved spectral function in a
quantum gas microscope with currently available techniques. As an example for
possible applications, we numerically calculate the spectrum of a single hole
excitation in one-dimensional $t-J$ models with isotropic and anisotropic
antiferromagnetic couplings. A sharp asymmetry in the distribution of spectral
weight appears when a hole is created in an isotropic Heisenberg spin chain.
This effect slowly vanishes for anisotropic spin interactions and disappears
completely in the case of pure Ising interactions. The asymmetry strongly
depends on the total magnetization of the spin chain, which can be tuned in
experiments with quantum gas microscopes. An intuitive picture for the observed
behavior is provided by a slave-fermion mean field theory. The key properties
of the spectra are visible at currently accessible temperatures.

we conduct a series of flux emergence simulations from the convection zone to

of the advection, stretching, and compression of magnetic fields. We show that
free magnetic energy builds up in the form of a current sheet above the PIL. It

coordinated observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)

accelerate incremental aggregated gradient (IAG) methods using aids from the
curvature (or Hessian) information, while avoiding the evaluation of matrix
inverses required by the incremental Newton (IN) method. Specifically, our idea
is to exploit the incrementally aggregated Hessian matrix to trace the full
gradient vector at every incremental step, therefore achieving an improved
linear convergence rate over the state-of-the-art IAG methods. For strongly
convex problems, the fast linear convergence rate requires the objective
function to be close to quadratic, or the initial point to be close to optimal
solution. Importantly, we show that running one iteration of the CIAG method
yields the same improvement to the optimality gap as running one iteration of
the full gradient method, while the complexity is $O(d^2)$ for CIAG and $O(md)$
for the full gradient. Overall, the CIAG method strikes a balance between the
high computation complexity incremental Newton-type methods and the slow IAG
method. Our numerical results support the theoretical findings and show that
the CIAG method often converges with much fewer iterations than IAG, and
requires much shorter running time than IN when the problem dimension is high.

show that under those mild conditions, the proposed asynchronous ADMM method
asymptotically converges to the KKT point of the non-convex problem. We
validate the effectiveness of asynchronous ADMM by applying it to the Optimal

growth of the field that propitiated progress and questionings, generating
alternative theories to explain specific phenomena. For example, it has been
argued that Bismuth, being a semimetal with a low number of carriers, does not
comply with the basic hypotheses underlying BCS and therefore a different
approach should be considered. Nevertheless, in 2016 based on BCS we put forth
a prediction that Bi at ambient pressure becomes a superconductor at 1.3 mK

superconductor with a transition temperature of 0.53 mK [2], a result that
eluded previous work. So, since Bi is superconductive in almost all the
different structures and phases, the question is why Bi-IV has been elusive and
has not been found yet to superconduct? Here we present a study of the
electronic and vibrational properties of Bi-IV and infer its possible
superconductivity using a BCS approach. We predict that if the Bi-IV phase

galaxy and the surrounding stellar halo. We map the line-of-sight velocity
distribution (LOSVD) using MUSE pointings covering NGC 3311 out to $25$ kpc.
Combining photometric and spectroscopic data, we model the LOSVD maps using a
finite mixture distribution, including four non-concentric, nearly isothermal
spheroids, with different line-of-sight systemic velocities $V$, velocity
dispersions $\sigma$, and higher order Gauss-Hermite moments $h_3$ and $h_4$.
The comparison of the correlations between $h_3$ and $h_4$ with $V/\sigma$ with
simulations indicates that NGC 3311 assembled mainly through dry mergers. The
$\sigma$ profile rises to $\simeq 400$ km s$^{\text -1}$ at 20 kpc indicating
that stars there were stripped from progenitors orbiting in the cluster core.
The finite mixture distribution modeling supports three inner components
related to the central galaxy and a fourth component with large effective
radius ($51$ kpc) and velocity dispersion ($327$ km s$^{\text{-1}}$) consistent
with a cD envelope. We find that the cD envelope is offset from the center of

quantum oscillations appearing in magnetic torque at a low temperature despite
the insulating behavior in resistance. These quantum oscillations show multiple
frequencies and varied effective masses. The origin of quantum oscillation is,
however, still under debate with evidence of both two-dimensional Fermi
surfaces and three-dimensional Fermi surfaces. Here, we carry out
angle-resolved torque magnetometry measurements in a magnetic field up to 45 T

(010) plane, the quantum oscillation frequency of the strongest oscillation
branch shows a four-fold rotational symmetry. However, in the angular
dependence of the amplitude of the same branch, this four-fold symmetry is
broken and, instead, a twofold symmetry shows up, which is consistent with the
prediction of a two-dimensional Lifshitz-Kosevich model. No deviation of
Lifshitz-Kosevich behavior is observed down to 40 mK. Our results suggest the
existence of multiple light-mass surface states in SmB6, with their mobility

compatible (i.e. there is a rooted phylogenetic $X$--tree that displays each
tree in $R$). We show that $\tau$ is phylogenetically flexible if and only if
it satisfies a Hall-type inequality condition of being `slim'. Using
submodularity arguments, we show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for
determining whether or not $\tau$ is slim. This `slim' condition reduces to a
simpler inequality in the case where all of the sets in $\tau$ have size 3, a
property we call `thin'. Thin sets were recently shown to be equivalent to the
existence of an (unrooted) tree for which the median function provides an
injective mapping to its vertex set; we show here that the unrooted tree in
this representation can always be chosen to be a caterpillar tree. We also
characterise when a collection $\tau$ of subsets of size 2 is thin (in terms of
the flexibility of total orders rather than phylogenies) and show that this
holds if and only if an associated bipartite graph is a forest. The
significance of our results for phylogenetics is in providing precise and

catalog containing 434 pulses from 387 BATSE Time-Tagged Event (TTE) GRBs.
Short GRB pulses exhibit correlated properties of duration, fluence, hardness,
and amplitude, and they evolve hard-to-soft while undergoing similar
triple-peaked light curves similar to those found in Long/Intermediate bursts.
We classify pulse light curves using their temporal complexities, demonstrating
that Short GRB pulses exhibit a range of complexities from smooth to highly
variable. Most of the bright, hard, chaotic emission seen in complex pulses
seems to represent a separate highly-variable emission component. Unlike
Long/Intermediate bursts, as many as 90\% of Short GRBs are single-pulsed.
However, emission in Short multi-pulsed bursts is coupled such that the first
pulse's duration is a predictor of both the interpulse separation and
subsequent pulse durations. These results strongly support the idea that
external shocks produce the prompt emission seen in Short GRBs. The
similarities between the triple-peaked structures and spectral evolution of
Long, Short, and Intermediate GRBs then suggests that external shocks are
responsible for the prompt emission observed in all GRB classes. In addition to
these findings, we identify a new type of gamma-ray transient in which peak
amplitudes occur at the end of the burst rather than at earlier times. Some of
these ""Crescendo"" bursts are preceded by rapid-fire ""Staccato"" pulses, whereas
the remaining are preceded by a variable episode that could be unresolved
staccato pulses.

time-reversal (TR) symmetry, which originally interconnects the two valleys.
This symmetry is spontaneously broken whenever the full electromagnetic

essential tool for understanding brain function and networks. However, due to
the sheer size of tfMRI data, its intrinsic complex structure, and lack of
ground truth of underlying neural activities, modeling tfMRI data is hard and
challenging. Previously proposed data-modeling methods including Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and Sparse Dictionary Learning only provided a weakly
established model based on blind source separation under the strong assumption
that original fMRI signals could be linearly decomposed into time series
components with corresponding spatial maps. Meanwhile, analyzing and learning a
large amount of tfMRI data from a variety of subjects has been shown to be very
demanding but yet challenging even with technological advances in computational
hardware. Given the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a robust method for
learning high-level abstractions from low-level data such as tfMRI time series,
in this work we propose a fast and scalable novel framework for distributed
deep Convolutional Autoencoder model. This model aims to both learn the complex
hierarchical structure of the tfMRI data and to leverage the processing power
of multiple GPUs in a distributed fashion. To implement such a model, we have
created an enhanced processing pipeline on the top of Apache Spark and
Tensorflow library, leveraging from a very large cluster of GPU machines.
Experimental data from applying the model on the Human Connectome Project (HCP)
show that the proposed model is efficient and scalable toward tfMRI big data
analytics, thus enabling data-driven extraction of hierarchical neuroscientific
information from massive fMRI big data in the future.

large-scale optimization problem for the best performance of distributed
solution methods. Solving a large-scale optimization problem sequen- tially can
be computationally challenging. One classic approach is to decompose the
problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them in a distributed fashion.
However, there is little discussion in the literature on which variables should
be grouped together to form the sub-problems, especially when the optimization
formulation involves complex constraints. We focus on one of the most popular
distributed approaches, dual decomposition and distributed sub-gradient
methods. Based on a theoretical guarantee on its convergence rate, we explain
that a partition of variables can critically affect the speed of convergence
and highlight the importance of the number of dualized constraints. Then, we
introduce a novel approach to find a partition that reduces the number of
dualized constraints by utilizing a community detection algorithm from physics
literature. Roughly speaking, the proposed method groups decision variables
that appear together in con- straints and solves the resulting sub-problems
with blocks of variables in parallel. Empirical experiments on a real
application show that the proposed method significantly accelerates the
convergence of the distributed sub-gradient method. The advantage of our
approach becomes more significant as the size of the problem increases and each
constraint involves more variables.

gap ($E_{g}^{\Gamma}$) and valence band spin-orbit splitting energy
($\Delta_{\textrm{SO}}$). $E_{g}^{\Gamma}$ ($\Delta_{\textrm{SO}}$) is measured
to decrease (increase) by approximately 200 meV (240 meV) with the
incorporation of 1% Bi, corresponding to a greater than fourfold increase in
$\Delta_{\textrm{SO}}$ in going from GaP to GaP$_{0.99}$Bi$_{0.01}$. The
evolution of $E_{g}^{\Gamma}$ and $\Delta_{\textrm{SO}}$ with $x$ is
characterised by strong, composition-dependent bowing. We demonstrate that a
simple valence band-anticrossing model, parametrised directly from atomistic
supercell calculations, quantitatively describes the measured evolution of
$E_{g}^{\Gamma}$ and $\Delta_{\textrm{SO}}$ with $x$. In contrast to the
well-studied GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_{x}$ alloy, in GaP$_{1-x}$Bi$_{x}$ substitutional
Bi creates localised impurity states lying energetically within the GaP host
matrix band gap. This leads to the emergence of an optically active band of
Bi-hybridised states, accounting for the overall large bowing of
$E_{g}^{\Gamma}$ and $\Delta_{\textrm{SO}}$ and in particular for the giant
bowing observed for $x \lesssim 1$%. Our analysis provides insight into the
action of Bi as an isovalent impurity, and constitutes the first detailed

solving parametrized partial differential equations. It identifies a
low-dimensional subspace for approximation of the parametric solution manifold
that is embedded in high-dimensional space. A reduced order model is
subsequently constructed in this subspace. RBM relies on residual-based error
indicators or {\em a posteriori} error bounds to guide construction of the
reduced solution subspace, to serve as a stopping criteria, and to certify the
resulting surrogate solutions. Unfortunately, it is well-known that the
standard algorithm for residual norm computation suffers from premature
stagnation at the level of the square root of machine precision.
  In this paper, we develop two alternatives to the standard offline phase of
reduced basis algorithms. First, we design a robust strategy for computation of
residual error indicators that allows RBM algorithms to enrich the solution
subspace with accuracy beyond root machine precision. Secondly, we propose a
new error indicator based on the Lebesgue function in interpolation theory.
This error indicator does not require computation of residual norms, and
instead only requires the ability to compute the RBM solution. This
residual-free indicator is rigorous in that it bounds the error committed by
the RBM approximation, but up to an uncomputable multiplicative constant.
Because of this, the residual-free indicator is effective in choosing snapshots
during the offline RBM phase, but cannot currently be used to certify error
that the approximation commits. However, it circumvents the need for \textit{a
posteriori} analysis of numerical methods, and therefore can be effective on
problems where such a rigorous estimate is hard to derive.

used in medical research to compare treatment and control groups or in
economics to compare various economic variables when repeated cross-sectional
data are available. Inspired by the so-called growth incidence curves
introduced in poverty research, we argue that the ratio of quantile functions
is a more appropriate and informative tool to compare two distributions. We
present an estimator for the ratio of quantile functions and develop
corresponding simultaneous confidence bands, which allow to assess significance
of certain features of the quantile functions ratio. Derived simultaneous
confidence bands rely on the asymptotic distribution of the quantile functions
ratio and do not require re-sampling techniques. The performance of the
simultaneous confidence bands is demonstrated in simulations. Analysis of the
expenditure data from Uganda in years 1999, 2002 and 2005 illustrates the
relevance of our approach.

Compton scattering is anticipated to be the most efficient process for
generating the continuum radiation, because the scattering cross section is
resonant at the cyclotron frequency. We present hard X-ray upscattering spectra
for uncooled monoenergetic relativistic electrons injected in inner regions of

closed field lines and obtained for different observing perspectives. The
spectral turnover energies are critically dependent on the observer viewing
angles and electron Lorentz factor. We find that electrons with energies less

with the turnovers inferred in magnetar hard X-ray tails. Electrons of higher
energy still emit most of the radiation below around 1 MeV, except for
quasi-equatorial emission locales for select pulse phases. Our spectral

avoidance region in the millimeter size-flux plane, as expected by the
Eddington limit for star formation. In order to understand what drives the
different millimeter-wave sizes in SMGs, we investigated the relation between
millimeter-wave size and AGN fraction for 25 of our SMGs at $z=1$--3. We found
that the SMGs for which the mid-IR emission is dominated by star formation or
AGN have extended millimeter-sizes, with respective median $R_{\rm c,e} =
1.6^{+0.34}_{-0.21}$ and 1.5$^{+0.93}_{-0.24}$ kpc. Instead, the SMGs for which
the mid-IR emission corresponds to star-forming/AGN composites have more
compact millimeter-wave sizes, with median $R_{\rm c,e}=1.0^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$
kpc. The relation between millimeter-wave size and AGN fraction suggests that
this size may be related to the evolutionary stage of the SMG. The very compact

thermodynamic limit) on the single-particle scattering coefficients through the
chain connected to two normal leads. Specifically, we show that, when the leads
are biased at a voltage V with respect to the superconducting chain, the Fano
factor is either zero (in the short-range correlated phase) or 2e (in the
long-range correlated phase). As a result, we find that the Fano factor works
as a directly measurable quantity to probe the quantum phase transition between
the two phases. In addition, we note a remarkable ""critical fractionalization

critical line. Finally, we note that a dual implementation of our proposed

antennas per square kilometer is fixed, what is the optimal network deployment?
A denser network with a less number of antennas per base station (BS) or the
opposite case. To evaluate network performance, we consider a practical network
scenario with a fixed antennas density and multiuser
multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) operations for single-antenna users.
The number of antennas in each BS is calculated by dividing the antenna density
by the BS density. With the consideration of several practical network models,
i.e., pilot contamination, a limited user equipment (UE) density and
probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path loss model, we
evaluate the area spectral efficiency (ASE) performance. From our simulation
results, we conclude that there exists an optimal BS density for a certain UE
density to maximize the ASE performance when the antenna density is fixed. The
intuition is that (i) by densifying the network with more BSs, we can achieve a
receive power gain due to the smaller distance between the typical UE and its
serving BS; (ii) by installing more antennas in each BS, we can achieve a
beamforming gain for UEs using MU-MIMO, although such beamforming gain is
degraded by pilot contamination; (iii) thus, a trade-off exists between the
receive power gain and the beamforming gain, if we fix the antenna density in
the network.

a common gait parameter, stride length, can be difficult to calculate directly
because relevant reference points continually move backwards. Although there is
no direct calculation of stride length itself, we can use positional
heel-marker data to directly determine a similar parameter, step length, and we
can sum two step lengths to result in one stride length. This proposed method
of calculation is simple but seems to be unexplored in other literature, so
this paper displays the details of the calculation. Our experimental results
differed from the expected values by 2.2% and had a very low standard
deviation, suggesting that this method is viable for practical use. The ability
to calculate stride length for treadmill walking using heel-marker data may
allow for quick and accurate gait calculations that further contribute to the
versatility of heel data as a tool for gait analysis.

beamforming and multiplexing, in the Terahertz (THz) band. The main problem
with the THz band is its huge propagation loss, which is caused by the
tremendous signal attenuation due to molecule absorption of the
electro-magnetic wave. To overcome the path loss issue, massive MIMO has been
suggested to be employed in the network and is expected to provide Tbps for a
distance within a few meters. In this context, beamforming is studied recently
as the main technique to take advantage of MIMO in THz and overcome the very
high path loss with the assumption that the THz communication channel is
Line-of-Sight (LoS) and there are not significant multipath rays. On the other
hand, recent studies also showed that the well-known absorbed energy by
molecules can be re-radiated immediately in the same frequency. Such
re-radiated signal is correlated with the main signal and can provide rich
scattering paths for the communication channel. This means that a significant
MIMO multiplexing gain can be achieved even in a LoS scenario for the THz band.
Our simulation results reveal a surprising observation that the MIMO
multiplexing could be a better choice than the MIMO beamforming under certain
conditions in THz communications.

and multiple-output (MIMO) capacity can be influenced by atmosphere molecules.
In more detail, some common atmosphere molecules, such as Oxygen and water, can
absorb and re-radiate energy in their natural resonance frequencies, such as
60GHz, 120GHz, and 180GHz, which belong to the millimeter wave (mmWave)
spectrum. Such phenomenon can provide equivalent non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths
in an environment that lacks scatterers, and thus greatly improve the spatial
multiplexing and diversity of a MIMO system. This kind of performance
improvement is particularly useful for most mmWave communications that heavily
rely on line-of-sight (LoS) transmissions. To sum up, our study concludes that
since the molecular re-radiation happens at certain mmWave frequency bands, the
MIMO capacity becomes highly frequency selective and enjoys a considerable
boosting at those mmWave frequency bands. The impact of our new discovery is
significant, which fundamentally changes our understanding on the relationship
between the MIMO capacity and the frequency spectrum. In particular, our
results predict that several mmWave bands can serve as valuable spectrum
windows for high-efficiency MIMO communications, which in turn may shift the
paradigm of research, standardization, and implementation in the field of
mmWave communications.

correction mechanism for the error control. The random nature of available

the length of the transmitted packet to be sampled depends on the available

samples of the packet are available. The selective sampling information bits
are piggybacked on the automatic repeat request messages for the transmitter
use. This way, the receiver node manages more efficiently its energy use.
Besides, we present the partially observable Markov decision process
formulation, which minimizes the long-term average pairwise error probability
and optimizes the transmit power. Optimal and suboptimal power assignment
strategies are introduced for retransmissions, which are adapted to the
selective sampling and channel state information. With finite battery size and
fixed power assignment policy, an analytical expression for the average packet
drop probability is derived. Numerical simulations show the performance gain of
the proposed scheme with power assignment strategy over the conventional

mean of their initial states. In real-world scenarios, these messages are
subject to bandwidth and power constraints, which motivates the design of a
lossy compression strategy. Few prior works consider the rate allocation
problem from the perspective of constrained optimization, which provides a
principled method for the design of lossy compression schemes, allows for the
relaxation of certain assumptions, and offers performance guarantees. We show
for Gaussian-distributed initial states with entropy-coded scalar quantization

optimized through generalized geometric programming. In the absence of side

  We find that hero projects are very common. In fact, as projects grow in

look more closely at the effects of heroes on software development. Analysis
shows that the frequency to close issues and bugs are not significantly
affected by the presence of project type (Public or Enterprise). Similarly, the
time needed to resolve an issue/bug/enhancement is not affected by heroes or
project type. This is a surprising result since, before looking at the data, we
expected that increasing heroes on a project will slow down howfast that
project reacts to change. However, we do find a statistically significant
association between heroes, project types, and enhancement resolution rates.
Heroes do not affect enhancement resolution rates in Public projects. However,
in Enterprise projects, the more heroes increase the rate at which project
complete enhancements.

sets of electronic, optical, and spin-orbit coupling properties, enables the
realization of unique physical phenomena in these few-atom thick building
blocks and in proximity to other materials. Herein, using NaSn2As2 as a model

ATt2Pn2 (A = Group 1 or 2 element, Tt = Group 14 tetrel element and Pn = Group
15 pnictogen element) and feature networks separated by van der Waals gaps can
be readily exfoliated with both mechanical and liquid-phase methods. We
identified the symmetries of the Raman active modes of the bulk crystals via
polarized Raman spectroscopy. The bulk and mechanically exfoliated NaSn2As2
samples are resistant towards oxidation, with only the top surface oxidizing in
ambient conditions over a couple of days, while the liquid-exfoliated samples
oxidize much more quickly in ambient conditions. Employing angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), density functional theory (DFT), and
transport on bulk and exfoliated samples, we show that NaSn2As2 is a highly
conducting 2D semimetal, with resistivities on the order of 10-6 {\Omega} m.
Due to peculiarities in the band structure, the dominating p-type carriers at
low temperature are nearly compensated by the opening of n-type conduction
channels as temperature increases. This work further expands the family of
exfoliatable 2D materials to layered van der Waals Zintl phases, opening up
opportunities in electronics and spintronics.

serves as an element of the PGL infrared photodetector (PGLIP) sensitive to the
incoming FIR/MIR due to the interband absorption. The spatially non-uniform
photocurrent generated in the PGLIP repeats (mimics) the non-uniform
distribution (image) created by the incident FIR/MIR. The injection of the
nonuniform photocurrent into the LED active layer results in the nonuniform
NIR/VIR image reproducing the FIR/MIR image. The PGL and the entire layer
structure are not deliberately partitioned into pixels. We analyze the
characteristics of such pixelless PGLIP-LED up-converters and show that their
image contrast transfer function and the up-conversion efficiency depend on the
PGL lateral resistivity. The up-converter exhibits high photoconductive gain
and conversion efficiency when the lateral resistivity is sufficiently high.
Several teams have successfully demonstrated the large area PGLs with the
resistivities varying in a wide range. Such layers can be used in the pixelless

substantially surpass the image up-converters based on the quantum-well

the construction of discrete equilibrium distribution function through
inversely solving the kinetic moment relations that it satisfies. The crucial
physical requirement is that all the used kinetic moment relations must be
consistent with the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The necessity of
such a kinetic model is that, with increasing the complexity of flows, the
dynamical characterization of non-equilibrium state and the understanding of
the constitutive relations need higher order kinetic moments and their
evolution. The DB models at the Euler and Navier-Stokes levels proposed by this
scheme are validated by several well-known benchmarks, ranging from
one-dimension to three-dimension. Particularly, when the local Mach number,
temperature ratio, and pressure ratio are as large as $10^2$, $10^4$, and
$10^5$, respectively, the simulation results are still in excellent agreement
with the Riemann solutions. How to model deeper thermodynamic non-equilibrium
flows by DB is indicated. Via the DB method, it convenient to simulate
nonequilibrium flows without knowing exact form of the hydrodynamic equations.

with additional sextupole fields set so that the x and y chromaticities vanish
and the maximizing of the lifetime of in-plane polarization (IPP) for a
0.97-GeV/c deuteron beam. The IPP magnitude was measured by continuously
monitoring the down-up scattering asymmetry (sensitive to sideways
polarization) in an in-beam, carbon-target polarimeter and unfolding the
precession of the IPP due to the magnetic anomaly of the deuteron. The optimum
operating conditions for a long IPP lifetime were made by scanning the field of
the storage ring sextupole magnet families while observing the rate of IPP loss
during storage of the beam. The beam was bunched and electron cooled. The IPP
losses appear to arise from the change of the orbit circumference, and
consequently the particle speed and spin tune, due to the transverse betatron
oscillations of individual particles in the beam. The effects of these changes
are canceled by an appropriate sextupole field setting.

sufficiently strong constraint, $\log-$concavity being a common example, has
the effect of restoring consistency without requiring additional parameters.
Since many results in economics require densities to satisfy a regularity
condition, these estimators are also attractive for the structural estimation
of economic models. In all of the examples of regularity conditions provided by
Bagnoli and Bergstrom (2005) and Ewerhart (2013), $\log-$concavity is
sufficient to ensure that the density satisfies the required conditions.
However, in many cases $\log-$concavity is far from necessary, and it has the
unfortunate side effect of ruling out sub-exponential tail behavior.
  In this paper, we use optimal transport to formulate a shape constrained
density estimator. We initially describe the estimator using a $\rho-$concavity
constraint. In this setting we provide results on consistency, asymptotic
distribution, convexity of the optimization problem defining the estimator, and
formulate a test for the null hypothesis that the population density satisfies
a shape constraint. Afterward, we provide sufficient conditions for these
results to hold using an arbitrary shape constraint. This generalization is
used to explore whether the California Department of Transportation's decision
to award construction contracts with the use of a first price auction is cost
minimizing. We estimate the marginal costs of construction firms subject to
Myerson's (1981) regularity condition, which is a requirement for the first
price reverse auction to be cost minimizing. The proposed test fails to reject
that the regularity condition is satisfied.

It took researchers nearly two decades for conceiving the structure of

approaches to the centre of intense study in fiber optics. The reason behind
this slow-pace development is, undoubtfully, its inexplicit guidance mechanism.
This paper aims at gaining a clear physical insight into the optical guidance
mechanism in NCF. To clarify the origins of light confinement, we boldly
disassemble the NCF structure into several layers and develop a multi-layered
model. Four physical origins, namely single-path Fresnel transmission through
cascaded interfaces, near-grazing incidence, multi-path interference caused by
Fresnel reflection, and glass wall shape are revealed and their individual
contributions are quantified for the first time. Such an elegant model could
not only elucidate the optical guidance in existing types of hollow-core fibers
but also assist in design of novel structure for new functions.

modeling, simulation, and data analytics for a broad class of computational

floating-point arithmetic calculations per second by aggregating the power of
millions of compute, memory, networking and storage components. With the
rapidly growing scale and complexity of HPC systems for achieving even greater
performance, ensuring their reliable operation in the face of system
degradations and failures is a critical challenge. System fault events often
lead the scientific applications to produce incorrect results, or may even

extreme-scale HPC systems and the complex interactions and dependencies among
the hardware and software components, the applications, and the physical

methodology for designing HPC resilience solutions using design patterns. We
codified the well-known techniques for handling faults, errors and failures
that have been devised, applied and improved upon over the past three decades
in the form of design patterns. In this paper, we present a pattern language to
enable a structured approach to the development of HPC resilience solutions.
The pattern language reveals the relations among the resilience patterns and
provides the means to explore alternative techniques for handling a specific
fault model that may have different efficiency and complexity characteristics.
Using the pattern language enables the design and implementation of
comprehensive resilience solutions as a set of interconnected resilience
patterns that can be instantiated across layers of the system stack.

strong interaction regime, where, inter-atomic interaction can no longer be
ignored. The analytical formalism developed for the two regimes, namely, deep
optical lattice and shallow optical lattice. Parametric dependencies of energy
spectrum and classical period, revival time and super revival are explained for
the two regimes.
  The dynamics of condensate in driven optical lattice crystal are analyzed by
studying dynamical stability of the condensate. The stability is determined by
the dispersion behavior of the condensate excited in driven optical lattice.
The recurrence behavior of the condensate close to the nonlinear resonances is
analyzed as a function of time for delicate recurrences which take place for
instance when lattice is weakly perturbed and robust recurrences which may
manifest themselves for sufficiently strong external driving force.
  The analysis is not only valid for dilute condensate but also applicable for
strongly interacting homogeneous condensate provided, the external modulation
causes no significant change in density profile of the condensate. We explain
parametric dependence of the dynamical recurrence times which can easily be
realized in laboratory experiments. In addition, we find a good agreement
between the obtained analytical results and numerical calculations. The
stability of condensate is also explored in driven optical lattice numerically.

the mapping between the bluff-body shape and the fluid forces. The deep neural

drive the computational time step size down, which makes long transient
problems prohibitively expensive. In the research presented, the feasibility of
a Coarse Grid CFD (CG-CFD) approach is investigated by utilizing Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms. Relying on coarse grids increases the discretization
error. Hence, a method is suggested to produce a surrogate model that predicts
the CG-CFD local errors to correct the variables of interest. Given
high-fidelity data, a surrogate model is trained to predict the CG-CFD local
errors as a function of the coarse grid local features. ML regression
algorithms are utilized to construct a surrogate model that relates the local
error and the coarse grid features. This method is applied to a
three-dimensional flow in a lid driven cubic cavity domain. The performance of
the method was assessed by training the surrogate model on the flow full field
spatial data and tested on new data (from flows of different Reynolds number
and/or computed by different grid sizes). The proposed method maximizes the
benefit of the available data and shows potential for a good predictive
capability.

of shape and form in living organisms--- is almost exclusively associated with
monolayers of tightly bound epithelial cells. To understand how such tissues
change their shape, we construct a fully covariant active-hydrodynamic theory.
At the cellular scale, stresses arise from apical contractility, mechanical
response and the constraint of constant cell volume. Tissue-scale deformations
emerge due to the balance between such cell-autonomous stresses and the
displacement and shear of a low Reynolds number embedding fluid. Tissues with
arbitrary curvature or shape can be described, providing a general framework
for epithelial monolayer morphology. Analysis of the stability of flat
monolayers reveals two generic shape instabilities: passive
constrained-buckling, and actively-driven tissue deformation. The active
instability can be further categorised into two types, corresponding to cell
shape changes that are either ""squamous to columnar"" or ""regular-prism to
truncated-pyramid"". The deformations resulting from the latter qualitatively
reproduce in vivo observations of the onset of both mesoderm and posterior

suggested in recent literature on this subject often require that the randomly
selected units are well distributed across the study region by using complex
algorithms that have the feature, essential in a design-based framework, to
respect the fixed first-order inclusion probabilities for every unit of the
population. The size of the frame, $N$, often causes some problems to these
algorithms since, being based on the distance matrix between the units of the
population, have at least a computational cost of order $N^2$. In this paper we
propose a draw-by-draw algorithm that randomly selects a sample of size $n$ in
exactly $n$ steps, updating at each step the selection probability of
not-selected units depending on their distance from the units already selected
in the previous steps. The performance of this solution is compared with those
of other methods derived from the {\it spatially balanced sampling} literature
in terms of their root mean squared error (RMSE) using the simple random
sampling (SRS) without replacement as benchmark. The fundamental interest is
not only to evaluate the efficiency of a such different procedure, but also to
understand if similar results can be obtained even with a notable reduction in
the computational burden needed to obtain more efficient sampling designs.
Repeated sample selections on real and simulated populations support this
perspective. An application to the Land Use and Land Cover Survey (LUCAS) 2012

(propagating as sound waves in the absence of a magnetic field), are amplified
adiabatically during the contraction, approximately conserving the wave action
density, until they either become nonlinear and steepen into shocks at a time
$t_{\rm nl}$, or become gravitationally unstable when the Jeans length
decreases below the scale of the perturbations at a time $t_{\rm gr}$. We
evaluate analytically the time $t_{\rm nl}$ at which the perturbations enter
the non-linear stage using a Burgers' equation approach, and we verify
numerically that this time marks the beginning of the phase of rapid
dissipation of the kinetic energy of the perturbations. We then show that for
typical values of the rms Mach number in molecular cloud cores, $t_{\rm nl}$ is
smaller than $t_{\rm gr}$, and therefore density perturbations likely dissipate
before becoming gravitational unstable. Solenoidal modes grow at a faster rate

However, the linear fittings of {\Delta}{\nu} versus {\nu}s relations of group
(I) and (II) are unsatisfactory to ensure any certain correlations. We suggest
that this phenomenon may arise from the fact that most measured kHz QPOs and
spins satisfy the conditions of 1.1 {\nu}s < {\nu}2 < 1300Hz and {\Delta}{\nu}
decreasing with {\nu}2. Apparently, the diversified distribution of
{\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}s refutes the simple beat-frequency model, and the
statistical correlations between the twin kHz QPOs and NS spins may arise from
the magnetosphere-disk boundary environments, e.g., co-rotation radius and NS
radius, that modulate the occurrences of X-ray signals. Furthermore, we also
find that the distribution of the ratio of {\nu}2 to {\nu}1 clusters around the
value of <{\nu}2/{\nu}1> ~ 3 : 2, which shows no obvious correlation with NS
spins.

realized in optically-pumped two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials (DMs), such
as graphene and topological insulator surface states. Here we discuss the
possibility of achieving a transient excitonic condensate in optically-pumped
three-dimensional (3D) DMs, such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals, described by
non-equilibrium chemical potentials for photoexcited electrons and holes.
Similar to the equilibrium case with long-range interactions, we find that for
pumped 3D DMs with screened Coulomb potential two possible excitonic phases
exist, an excitonic insulator phase and the charge density wave phase
originating from intranodal and internodal interactions, respectively. In the
pumped case, the critical coupling for excitonic instability vanishes;
therefore, the two phases coexist for arbitrarily weak coupling strengths. The
excitonic gap in the charge density wave phase is always the largest one. The
competition between screening effects and the increase of the density of states
with optical pumping results in a reach phase diagram for the transient
excitonic condensate. Based on the static theory of screening, we find that
under certain conditions for the value of the dimensionless coupling constant
screening in 3D DMs can be weaker than in 2D DMs. Furthermore, we identify the
signatures of the transient excitonic condensate that could be probed by
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, photoemission and optical conductivity
measurements. Finally, we provide estimates of critical temperatures and
excitonic gaps for existing and hypothetical 3D DMs.

physical appearance is very simple: an antenna consisting of a normal metal,
sometimes a normal metal-superconductor bilayer, connected to a thin film of a
narrow, short superconductor with a high resistivity in the normal state. The
device is brought into an optimal operating regime by applying a dc current and
a certain amount of local- oscillator power. Despite this technological
simplicity its operation has been found to be controlled by many different
aspects of superconductivity, all occurring simultaneously. A core ingredient
is the understanding that there are two sources of resistance in a
superconductor: a charge conversion resistance occurring at an
normal-metal-superconductor interface and a resistance due to time- dependent
changes of the superconducting phase. The latter is responsible for the actual
mixing process in a non-uniform superconducting environment set up by the
bias-conditions and the geometry. The present understanding indicates that
further improvement needs to be found in the use of other materials with a
faster energy-relaxation rate. Meanwhile several empirical parameters have

close-by planets may produce stellar flares as observed in active binary
systems. However, in spite of several claims, conclusive evidence is still
lacking. We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using
analytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We
investigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The
first two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\mu$, where
$B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\mu$ the
magnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose
coronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by
planets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in
weakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly
open field lines at the distance of their planets. The released energy is of
the order of $(0.002-0.1) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\mu$ and depends on the ratio of the
planetary to the stellar fields, thus allowing an indirect measurement of the
former when the latter is known. We compute the released energy for different
separations of the planet and different stellar parameters finding the
conditions for the operation of the proposed mechanisms. An application to
eight selected systems is presented. The computed energies and dissipation
timescales are in agreement with flare observations in the eccentric system HD

improve the performance of the traditional precoded Alamouti coding for

Fourier transform codebook (DFTC) performs satisfactorily with Alamouti coding
and offers numerous benefits for the Rayleigh fading channel, this scheme
inherently generates huge codeword distortion, which leads to a lower minimum
chordal distance (MCD). Furthermore, the uncertain format of all prior versions
of codebooks results in poorer minimum determinant (MD) values. Hence, the
proposed GHC scheme successfully deals with the issues of traditional DFTC to
achieve a better codebook format that completely overcome both MCD and MD

antennas is a consensus model which is considered as a standard for processing
high-precision VLBI observations. It was created as a compromise between a
variety of relativistic VLBI models proposed by different authors as documented
in the IERS Conventions 2010. The accuracy of the consensus model is in the
picosecond range for the group delay but this is not sufficient for current
geodetic pur- poses. This paper provides a fully documented derivation of a new
relativistic model having an accuracy substantially higher than one picosecond
and based upon a well accepted formalism of relativistic celestial mechanics,
astrometry and geodesy. Our new model fully confirms the consensus model at the
picosecond level and in several respects goes to a great extent beyond it. More
specifically, terms related to the acceleration of the geocenter are considered
and kept in the model, the gravitational time-delay due to a massive body
(planet, Sun, etc.) with arbitrary mass and spin-multipole moments is derived
taking into account the motion of the body, and a new formalism for the
time-delay problem of radio sources located at finite distance from VLBI
stations is presented. Thus, the paper presents a substantially elaborated
theoretical justification of the consensus model and its significant extension
that allows researchers to make concrete estimates of the magnitude of residual
terms of this model for any conceivable configuration of the source of light,
massive bodies, and VLBI stations. The largest terms in the relativistic time
delay which can affect the current VLBI observations are from the quadrupole
and the angular momentum of the gravitating bodies that are known from the
literature. These terms should be included in the new geodetic VLBI model for
improving its consistency.

of diffuse priors (having one's cake) while achieving theoretically justified
inferences (eating it too). We demonstrate this methodology for Bayesian
hypotheses tests for scenarios under which the one and two sample t-tests, and
linear models are typically derived. The resulting Bayesian test statistic
takes the form of a penalized likelihood ratio test statistic. By considering
the sampling distribution under the null and alternative hypotheses we show for
independent identically distributed regular parametric models that Bayesian
hypothesis tests using cake priors are Chernoff-consistent, i.e., achieve zero
type I and II errors asymptotically. Lindley's paradox is also discussed. We
argue that a true Lindley's paradox will only occur with small probability for
large sample sizes.

of bottom squark pair production, the bottom squark masses are excluded up to

light curves harbouring ""trends"" with a typical timescale longer than the
exposure length. The origin of these changes was proposed to be linked to
large-scale structures in the wind, but further characterization of the
variability at high energies was needed. Since then, a number of new X-ray
observations have become available. Furthermore, a cyclic behaviour with a
1.78d period was identified in long optical photometric runs, which is thought
to be associated with the launching mechanism of large-scale wind structures.
We analysed these new X-ray data, revisited the old data, and compared X-ray
with optical data, including when simultaneous. We found that the behaviour in
X-rays cannot be explained in terms of a perfect clock because the amplitude
and shape of its variations change with time. For example, zeta Puppis was much
more strongly variable between 2007 and 2011 than before and after this
interval. Comparing the X-ray spectra of the star at maximum and minimum
brightness yields no compelling difference beyond the overall flux change: the
temperatures, absorptions, and line shapes seem to remain constant, well within
errors. The only common feature between X-ray datasets is that the variation
amplitudes appear maximum in the medium (0.6-1.2keV) energy band. Finally, no
clear and coherent correlation can be found between simultaneous X-ray and
optical data. Only a subgroup of observations may be combined coherently with
the optical period of 1.78d, although the simultaneous optical behaviour is
unknown. The currently available data do not reveal any obvious, permanent, and
direct correlation between X-ray and optical variations. The origin of the
X-ray variability therefore still needs to be ascertained, highlighting the
need for long-term monitoring in multiwavelengths, i.e. X-ray, UV, and optical.

undergo a reversible first order semiconductor to metal transition (SMT)
accompanied by a structural phase transition to rutile tetragonal, R phase.
Around the phase transition, VO2 also experiences noticeable change in its
optical and electrical properties. A change in color of the VO2 micro crystals
from white to cyan around the transition temperature is observed, which is
further understood by absorption of red light using temperature dependent
ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis and photoluminescence studies. The
absorption of light in the red region is explained by the optical transition
between Hubbard states, confirming the electronic correlation as the driving
force for SMT in VO2. The thermochromism in VO2 has been studied for smart
window applications so far in the IR region, which supports the opening of the
band gap in semiconducting phase; whereas there is hardly any report in the
management of visible light. The filtering of blue light along with reflection
of infrared above the semiconductor to metal transition temperature make VO2
applicable as advanced smart windows for overall heat management of a closure.

to the open gaps induced by the quantum confinement effect. We show that the
Seebeck coefficient of BL-AGNRs is also classified into three groups 3p, 3p +

increases up to 857 uV/K under the impact of the vertical electric field. While
in the semimetallic structure of width of 14 dimer lines, the Seebeck
coefficient remarkably enhances 14 times from 40 uV/K to 555 uV/K. Moreover, it
unveils an appealing result as the Seebeck coefficient always increases with
the increase of the applied potential. Such BL-AGNRs appear to be very
promising for the applications of the next generation of both electronic and

Msun. The FeII* and MgII emitters follow the galaxy main sequence, but with a
clear dichotomy. Galaxies with masses below 10^9 Msun and star formation rates
(SFRs) of <1 Msun/year have MgII emission without accompanying FeII* emission,
whereas galaxies with masses above 10^10 Msun and SFRs >10 Msun/year have FeII*
emission without accompanying MgII emission. Between these two regimes,
galaxies have both MgII and FeII* emission, typically with MgII P-Cygni
profiles. Indeed, the MgII profile shows a progression along the main sequence
from pure emission to P-Cygni profiles to strong absorption, due to resonant
trapping. Combining the deep MUSE data with HST ancillary information, we find
that galaxies with pure MgII emission profiles have lower star formation rate
surface densities than those with either MgII P-Cygni profiles or FeII*
emission. These spectral signatures produced through continuum scattering and
fluorescence, MgII P-Cygni profiles and FeII* emission, are better candidates
for tracing galactic outflows than pure MgII emission, which may originate from
HII regions. We compare the absorption and emission rest-frame equivalent
widths for pairs of FeII transitions to predictions from outflow models and
find that the observations consistently have less total re-emission than
absorption, suggesting either dust extinction or non-isotropic outflow
geometries.

For inversion purposes, it has the attractive feature that random draws from an
uncorrelated standard normal distribution yield model realizations with spatial
characteristics that are in agreement with the training set. In comparison with
the most commonly used parametric representations in probabilistic inversion,
we find that our dimensionality reduction (DR) approach outperforms principle
component analysis (PCA), optimization-PCA (OPCA) and discrete cosine transform
(DCT) DR techniques for unconditional geostatistical simulation of a
channelized prior model. For the considered examples, important compression
ratios (200 - 500) are achieved. Given that the construction of our
parameterization requires a training set of several tens of thousands of prior
model realizations, our DR approach is more suited for probabilistic (or
deterministic) inversion than for unconditional (or point-conditioned)
geostatistical simulation. Probabilistic inversions of 2D steady-state and 3D
transient hydraulic tomography data are used to demonstrate the DR-based
inversion. For the 2D case study, the performance is superior compared to
current state-of-the-art multiple-point statistics inversion by sequential

also encouraging.

up a study (initiated by Boston) of this type of question under the assumption
that L is Galois over some subfield k of K such that [K : k] is a prime = p.
Letting $\sigma$ be a generator of Gal(K/k), we study the constraints posed on
the arithmetic of L/K by the cyclic action of $\sigma$ on $\Gamma$, focusing on
the critical role played by the fixed points of this action, and their relation
to the ramification in L/K. The method of Boston works only when there are no
non-trivial fixed points for this action. We show that even in the presence of
arbitrarily many fixed points, the action of $\sigma$ places severe arithmetic
conditions on the existence of finitely and tamely ramified uniform p-adic

deduce the non-existence of such extensions over K from their non-existence

the operation of traffic networks modeled by the Cell Transmission Model via
ramp metering and partial mainline demand control. Optimal control problems
using the Cell Transmission Model are usually non-convex, due to the nonlinear
fundamental diagram, but a convex relaxation in which demand and supply
constraints are relaxed is often used. Previous works have established
conditions under which solutions of the relaxation can be made feasible with
respect to the original constraints. In this work, we generalize these
conditions and show that the control of flows into merging junctions is
sufficient to do so if the objective is to minimize the total time spent in
traffic. We derive this result by introducing an alternative system
representation. In the new representation, the system dynamics are concave and
state-monotone. We show that exactness of the convex relaxation of finite
horizon optimal control problems follows from these properties. Deriving the
main result via a characterization of the system dynamics allows one to treat
arbitrary monotone, concave fundamental diagrams and several types of control
for merging junctions in a uniform manner. The derivation also suggests a
straightforward method to verify if the results continue to hold for extensions

We identified 26 group members within r200=0.9 Mpc. The LF of the group shows a
flat faint-end slope ( -1.08 +/- 0.33). This low density of dwarf galaxies is
confirmed by the low value of the dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR = 0.99 +/- 0.49)
for this system. Both the lack of dwarf galaxies and the low luminosity of the
BGG suggests that RXJ075243.6+455653 still has to accrete mass from its nearby
environment. This mass accretion will be achieved because it is the dominant
structure of a rich environment formed by several groups of galaxies (15)
within 7 Mpc from the group center and with +/- 1000$ km/s. RXJ075243.6+455653
is a group of galaxies that has not yet completed the process of its mass

always the same Killing spinor. The existence of such Killing spinors is
related to the representation theory of finite groups, i.e. of the point group
that underlies the orbifold. However, by going through all inequivalent

show that this is never possible: For any non-supersymmetric orbifold there is
always (at least) one sector, that does not admit any Killing spinor. The

conjecture, which we have tested by going through an even larger number of
finite groups. This conjecture could be applied to situations beyond symmetric

generic question is whether random or directionally biased motions or a
combination of both provide an optimal search efficiency and how that depends
on the motility and density of targets and obstacles. To address this question,
we develop a simple model that involves a random walker searching for its
targets in a heterogeneous medium of bond percolation square lattice and used
mean first passage time (MFPT, $\langle T \rangle$) as an indication of average
search time. Our analysis reveals a dual effect of directional bias on the
minimum value of $\langle T \rangle$. For a homogeneous medium, directionality
always decreases $\langle T \rangle$ and a pure directional migration (a
ballistic motion) serves as the optimized strategy; while for a heterogeneous
environment, we find that the optimized strategy involves a combination of
directed and random migrations. The relative contribution of these modes is
determined by the density of obstacles and motility of targets. Existence of
randomness and motility of targets add to the efficiency of search. Our study
reveals generic and simple rules that govern search efficiency. Our findings
might find application in a number of areas including immunology, cell biology,

inevitable in dealing with the challenging non-linear dynamics that come into
play as a result of the increasing laser intensities and the shorter

approximation for convenience reasons, in the strong-field regime the validity
of this approximation is questionable. We have made a detailed comparison of

Dirac semimetal in two dimensions by using the perturbative
renormalization-group method. Depending on the magnitude of the tilting
parameter, the undoped system can have either Fermi points (type-I) or Fermi
lines (type-II). Previous studies usually performed the renormalization-group
transformations by integrating out the modes with large momenta. This is
problematic when the Fermi surface is open, like type-II Dirac fermions. In
this work, we study the effects of Coulomb interactions, following the spirit
of Shankar\cite{Shankar}, by introducing a cutoff in the energy scale around
the Fermi surface and integrating out the high-energy modes. For type-I Dirac
fermions, our result is consistent with that of the previous work. On the other
hand, we find that for type-II Dirac fermions, the magnitude of the tilting
parameter increases monotonically with lowering energies. This implies the
stability of type-II Dirac fermions in the presence of Coulomb interactions, in
contrast with previous results. Furthermore, for type-II Dirac fermions, the
velocities in different directions acquire different renormalization even if
they have the same bare values. By taking into account the renormalization of
the tilting parameter and the velocities due to the Coulomb interactions, we
show that while the presence of a charged impurity leads only to charge
redistribution around the impurity for type-I Dirac fermions, for type-II Dirac
fermions, the impurity charge is completely screened, albeit with a very long
screening length. The latter indicates that the temperature dependence of
physical observables are essentially determined by the RG equations we derived.
We illustrate this by calculating the temperature dependence of the
compressibility and specific heat of the interacting tilted Dirac fermions.

non-quadratic data fidelity or penalty terms such source conditions are often
formulated in the form of variational inequalities. Such variational source
conditions (VSCs) as well as other formulations of such conditions in Banach

first step towards higher order VSCs has been taken by Grasmair (2013) who
obtained convergence rates up to the saturation of Tikhonov regularization. For
even higher order convergence rates, iterated versions of variational
regularization have to be considered. In this paper we introduce VSCs of
arbitrarily high order which lead to optimal convergence rates in Hilbert

general data fidelity and penalty terms, we derive convergence rates under

and ligand composition on the efficacy of binding of a ligand-coated-particle
to a substrate functionalized with the target receptors. First, we show how
molecular dynamics (MD) along with Steered MD calculations can be used to
accurately parameterize the molecular binding free energy and the effective
spring constant for a receptor-ligand pair. We demonstrate this for two ligands
that bind to the $\alpha_5\beta_1$-domain of integrin. Next, we show how these
effective potentials can be used to build computational models at the meso- and
continuum- scales. These models incorporate the molecular nature of the
receptor-ligand interactions and yet provide an inexpensive route to study the
multivalent interaction of receptors and ligands through the construction of
Bell potentials customized to the molecular identities. We quantify the binding
efficacy of the ligand-coated-particle in terms of its multivalency, binding
free energy landscape and the losses in the configurational entropies. We show
that (i) the binding avidity for particle sizes less than $350$ nm is set by
the competition between the enthalpic and entropic contributions while that for
sizes above $350$ nm is dominated by the enthalpy of binding, (ii) anisotropic
particles display higher multivalent binding compared to spherical particles
and (iii) variations in ligand composition can alter binding avidity without
altering the average multivalency. The methods and results presented here have
wide applications in the rational design of functionalized carriers and also in
understanding cell adhesion.

large, coherent structures, forming a mean flow. The purpose of this paper is
to elucidate how these structures are sustained, and what determines them and
the fluctuations around them. A recent theory for the mean flow will be
reviewed. The theory assumes turbulence is excited by a forcing supported on
small scales, and uses a linear shear model to relate the turbulent momentum
flux to the mean shear rate. Extending the theory, it will be shown here that
the relation between the momentum flux and mean shear is valid, and the
momentum flux is non-zero, for both an isotropic and an anisotropic forcing,
independent of the dissipation mechanism at small scales. This conclusion
requires taking into account that the linear shear model is an approximation to
the real system. The proportionality between the momentum flux and the inverse
of the shear can then be inferred most simply on dimensional grounds. Moreover,
for a homogeneous pumping, the proportionality constant can be determined by
symmetry considerations, recovering the result of the original theory. The
regime of applicability of the theory, its compatibility with observations from
simulations, a formula for the momentum flux for an inhomogeneous pumping, and
results for the statistics of fluctuations, will also be discussed.

proposed a new practical method for computing expected values of functionals of
solutions for certain classes of elliptic partial differential equations with
random coefficients. This method was based on combining quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)
methods for computing the expected values with circulant embedding methods for
sampling the random field on a regular grid. It was found capable of handling
fluid flow problems in random heterogeneous media with high stochastic
dimension, but a convergence theory was missing. This paper provides a
convergence analysis for the method in the case when the QMC method is a
specially designed randomly shifted lattice rule. The convergence result
depends on the eigenvalues of the underlying nested block circulant matrix and
can be independent of the number of stochastic variables under certain
assumptions. In fact the QMC analysis applies to general factorisations of the
covariance matrix to sample the random field. The error analysis for the
underlying fully discrete finite element method allows for locally refined
meshes (via interpolation from a regular sampling grid of the random field).
Numerical results on a non-regular domain with corner singularities in two
spatial dimensions and on a regular domain in three spatial dimensions are
included.

understand how-and-why the characteristics of NPLs are influenced, particularly
at elevated temperature, where both reversible and irreversible quenching
processes come into picture. Here we present a study on the effect of elevated
temperature on the characteristics of colloidal CdSe NPLs. We used an
effective-mass envelope function theory based 8-band k$\cdot$p model and
density-matrix theory considering exciton-phonon interaction. We observed the
photoluminescence (PL) spectra at various temperatures for their photon
emission energy, PL linewidth and intensity by considering the exciton-phonon
interaction with both acoustic and optical phonons using Bose-Einstein
statistical factors. With rise in temperature we observed a fall in the
transition energy (emission redshift), matrix element, Fermi factor and quasi
Fermi separation, with reduction in intraband state gaps and increased
interband coupling. Also, there was a fall in the PL intensity, along with
spectral broadening due to an intraband scattering effect. The predicted
transition energy values and simulated PL spectra at varying temperatures
exhibit appreciable consistency with experimental results. Our findings have
important implications for application of NPLs in optoelectronic devices, such
as NPL lasers and LEDs, operating much above room temperature.

when the nodes are mobile and spread so widely that in most cases multiple hops
are needed to route a message from one node to another. In fact, it is known
that any online routing protocol has a poor performance in the worst case, in a
sense that there is a distribution of nodes resulting in bad routing paths for
that protocol, even if the nodes know their geographic positions and the
geographic position of the destination of a message is known. The reason for
that is that radio holes in the ad hoc network may require messages to take
long detours in order to get to a destination, which are hard to find in an
online fashion.
  In this paper, we assume that the wireless ad hoc network can make limited
use of long-range links provided by a global communication infrastructure like
a cellular infrastructure or a satellite in order to compute an abstraction of
the wireless ad hoc network that allows the messages to be sent along
near-shortest paths in the ad hoc network. We present distributed algorithms

paths between any two nodes of the ad hoc network for some constant $c$ if the

  Resonance",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a standard imaging
modality for assessing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of
death globally. CMR enables accurate quantification of the cardiac chamber
volume, ejection fraction and myocardial mass, providing information for
diagnosis and monitoring of CVDs. However, for years, clinicians have been
relying on manual approaches for CMR image analysis, which is time consuming
and prone to subjective errors. It is a major clinical challenge to
automatically derive quantitative and clinically relevant information from CMR
images. Deep neural networks have shown a great potential in image pattern
recognition and segmentation for a variety of tasks. Here we demonstrate an
automated analysis method for CMR images, which is based on a fully
convolutional network (FCN). The network is trained and evaluated on a
large-scale dataset from the UK Biobank, consisting of 4,875 subjects with
93,500 pixelwise annotated images. The performance of the method has been
evaluated using a number of technical metrics, including the Dice metric, mean
contour distance and Hausdorff distance, as well as clinically relevant
measures, including left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and
end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV mass (LVM); right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic
volume (RVEDV) and end-systolic volume (RVESV). By combining FCN with a
large-scale annotated dataset, the proposed automated method achieves a high
performance on par with human experts in segmenting the LV and RV on short-axis
CMR images and the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) on long-axis CMR
images.

information-leakage with respect to sensitive data and distortion with respect

privacy-utility tradeoff that has strong connections to generalized
rate-distortion problems. In this work, we study how the optimal
privacy-utility tradeoff region is affected by constraints on the data that is
directly available as input to the release mechanism. In particular, we
consider the availability of only sensitive data, only useful data, and both
(full data). We show that a general hierarchy holds: the tradeoff region given
only the sensitive data is no larger than the region given only the useful
data, which in turn is clearly no larger than the region given both sensitive
and useful data. In addition, we determine conditions under which the tradeoff
region given only the useful data coincides with that given full data. These
are based on the common information between the sensitive and useful data. We
establish these results for general families of privacy and utility measures
that satisfy certain natural properties required of any reasonable measure of
privacy or utility. We also uncover a new, subtler aspect of the data
processing inequality for general non-symmetric privacy measures and discuss
its operational relevance and implications. Finally, we derive exact
closed-analytic-form expressions for the privacy-utility tradeoffs for
symmetrically dependent sensitive and useful data under mutual information and
Hamming distortion as the respective privacy and utility measures.

preexisting features. Effectively, the process projects the input data into a

performance of machine learning methods. The advantages and disadvantages of
each optimization strategy are discussed.

hybrid (TiC+TiB) networks reinforced Ti-6Al-4V composites were investigated
after fabricated with reaction hot pressing technique. The inhomogeneous
distribution of hybrid reinforcers resulted in a sort of stress-induced grain
refinement for {\alpha}-Ti matrix phase, which was further facilitated by
heterogeneous nucleation upon additive interfaces. HRTEM analyses revealed the
crystallographic orientation relation between TiB and alpha-Ti phases as
(201)TiB//(-1100)alpha-Ti plus [11-2]//[0001] alpha-Ti, while TiC and
{\alpha}-Ti phases maintained the interrelation of (-200)TiC//(-2110)
{\alpha}-Ti and [001]TiC//[01-10] alpha-Ti. The hybridly reinforced
Ti-6Al-4V/(TiC+TiB) composites displayed superior oxidation resistance to both
the sintered matrix alloy and the two composites reinforced solely with TiC or
TiB addition during the cyclic oxidation at 873, 973 and 1073 K respectively
for 100 h. The hybrid reinforcers volume fraction was a more influential factor
to improve oxidation resistance than the matrix alloy powder size. As
temperature rose from 873 to 1073 K, the oxidation kinetics transferred from
the nearly parabolic type through qusilinear tendency into the finally linear
mode. This corresponded to the morphological transition of oxide scales from a
continuous protective film to a partially damaged layer and ended up with the
complete spallation of alternating alumina and rutile multilayers. A
phenomenological model was proposed to elucidate the growth process of oxides
scales. The release of thermal stress, the suppression of oxygen diffusion and
the fastening of oxide adherence were found as the three major mechanisms to
enhance the oxidation resistance of hybrid reinforced composites.

quantitative relation between the critical threshold and initial distribution.
Further, our numerical simulations illustrate the consensus behaviour of the
agents in network topologies including lattices and, small-world and scale-free
networks, as well as for structure-dependent convergence parameters
accommodating node heterogeneity. We find that the critical thresholds for
consensus tend to agree with the predicted upper bounds in Theorems 4 and 5 in

formation when the initial opinion configuration is within a bounded range and,
provide insight into information diffusion and social dynamics in multiplex

Influenza surveillance data of these seven countries from 2009 to 2017 were
downloaded from the FluNet of the World Health Organization. Secondary data
were collected for the countries' population, and the dates of Hajj and
Hanukkah. We aggregated the weekly influenza A and B laboratory confirmations
for each country over the study period. Weekly influenza A patterns and
religious festival dates were further explored across the study period. Results
We found that influenza A peaks closely followed Hanukkah in Israel in six out
of seven years from 2010 to 2017. Aggregated influenza A peaks of the other six
Middle East countries also occurred right after Hajj every year during the
study period. Conclusions We predict that unless there is an emergence of new

promote base classifiers which are the most susceptible to the correction based

terms of six different quality criteria. The conducted experiments reveals that
the proposed approach eliminates one of main drawbacks of the original

introduced method achieves satisfying classification quality under all

satisfies some critical conditions, the relative velocity between them can be
arbitrarily large, thus the energy of the center-of-mass will reach infinity.
Such a process is called BSW mechanism which can accelerate a particle to
arbitrarily high energy. There are also some studies showing that a Kerr naked
singularity can be more qualified as a particle accelerator for arbitrarily
high energy. Previous researchers mainly concentrate on geodesic motion of
particles. In this paper, we will take spinning particles which won't move
along a timelike geodesic and carry more parameters into our consideration. By
employing the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation, we will prove that for a
spinning particle in hyper-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom or Kerr spacetime where
exists a naked singularity at $r=0$, its Effective Potential
$V_{eff}=-\dot{r}^2$ must be able to reach zero within the interval $0 < r <
M$, thus an ingoing particle will be able to turn back and then collide with
another ingoing particle at $r=M$. If the spacetime is ${\bf slightly}$

recently detected through gravitational-wave (GW) emission, with the latter
followed by post-merger electromagnetic counterparts, appearing seconds up to
weeks after the merger. While post-merger electromagnetic counterparts had been
anticipated theoretically, very little electromagnetic precursors to GW-sources
had been proposed, and non observed yet. Here we show that a fraction of ${\rm
a}\,{\rm few\times}10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ of LIGO GW-sources and short-GRBs, could be
preceded by supernovae-explosions years up to decades before the merger. Each
of the BH/NS-progenitors in GW-sources are thought to form following a
supernova, likely accompanied by a natal velocity-kick to the newly born
compact object. The evolution and natal-kicks determine the orbits of surviving
binaries, and hence the delay-time between the birth of the compact-binary and
its final merger through GW-emission. We use data from binary evolution
population-synthesis models to show that the delay-time distribution has a
non-negligible tail of ultra-short delay-times between 1-100 yrs, thereby
giving rise to potentially observable supernovae precursors to GW-sources.
Moreover, future LISA/DECIGO GW space-detectors will enable the detection of
GW-inspirals in the pre-mergers stage weeks to decades before the final merger.
These ultra-short delay-time sources could therefore produce a unique type of
promptly appearing LISA/DECIGO-GW-sources accompanied by \emph{coincident}
supernovae. The archival (and/or direct) detection of precursor (coincident)
SNe with GW and/or short-GRBs will provide unprecedented characterizations of
the merging-binaries, and their prior evolution through supernovae and natal

UE's mobility state, using 3GPP network signal strength patterns. We have
implemented various discovery schemes in Android framework, to evaluate the
performance of our proposed scheme against other solutions in the literature.
Since, Android does not support selective scanning mode, we have implemented
modules in Android to enable selective scanning. Further, we have also used
simulation studies and justified the results using power consumption modeling.
The results from the field experiments and simulations have shown high power

Superconducting MMs have the advantage of ultra low losses, a highly desirable
feature. The additional use of the Josephson effect and SQUID configurations
produce further specificity and functionality. SQUID-based MMs are both
theoretically investigated but also fabricated and analyzed experimentally in
many labs and exciting new phenomena have been found both in the classical and
quantum realms. The SQUID is a unique nonlinear oscillator that can be
manipulated through multiple external means. This flexibility is inherited to
SQUID-based MMs, i.e. extended units that contain a large arrangement of
SQUIDs. Such an assembly of weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators presents a
nonlinear dynamics laboratory where numerous complex spatio-temporal phenomena
may be explored. We focus primarily on SQUID-based MMs and present basic
properties related to their individual and collective responses to external

demonstrate that the Josephson nonlinearity leads to wide-band tunability,
intrinsic nonlinear as well as flat band localization. We explore further
properties such as multistability and self-organization and the emergence of
chimera states. We then dwell into the truly quantum regime and explore the
interaction of electromagnetic pulses with superconducting qubits where the
coupling between the two yields self-induced transparency and superradiance. We
