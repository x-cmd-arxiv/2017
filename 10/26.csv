pattern) that encodes rotation invariance into the main formulation itself.
This makes any post processing stage for rotation invariance redundant and
improves on both accuracy and time complexity. We consider fine-grained
lepidoptera (moth/butterfly) species recognition as the representative problem
since it involves repetition of localized patterns and textures that may be
exploited for discrimination. We evaluate the performance of LOOP against its
predecessors as well as few other popular descriptors. Besides experiments on
standard benchmarks, we also introduce a new small image dataset on NZ
Lepidoptera. Loop performs as well or better on all datasets evaluated compared
to previous binary descriptors. The new dataset and demo code of the proposed
method are to be made available through the lead author's academic webpage and
GitHub.

  networks","Shorter version accepted at ICASSP 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a learning algorithm for cell-load approximation in wireless
networks. The proposed algorithm is robust in the sense that it is designed to
cope with the uncertainty arising from a small number of training samples. This
scenario is highly relevant in wireless networks where training has to be
performed on short time scales because of a fast time-varying communication
environment. The first part of this work studies the set of feasible rates and
shows that this set is compact. We then prove that the mapping relating a
feasible rate vector to the unique fixed point of the non-linear cell-load
mapping is monotone and uniformly continuous. Utilizing these properties, we
apply an approximation framework that achieves the best worst-case performance.
Furthermore, the approximation preserves the monotonicity and continuity
properties. Simulations show that the proposed method exhibits better
robustness and accuracy for small training sets in comparison with standard
approximation techniques for multivariate data.

merger, a compact remnant is left over whose nature depends primarily on the
masses of the inspiralling objects and on the equation of state of nuclear
matter. This could be either a black hole or a neutron star (NS), with the
latter being either long-lived or too massive for stability implying delayed
collapse to a black hole. Here, we present a search for gravitational waves
from the remnant of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 using data from
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We search for short ($\lesssim1$ s) and
intermediate-duration ($\lesssim 500$ s) signals, which includes
gravitational-wave emission from a hypermassive NS or supramassive NS,
respectively. We find no signal from the post-merger remnant. Our derived
strain upper limits are more than an order of magnitude larger than those
predicted by most models. For short signals, our best upper limit on the
root-sum-square of the gravitational-wave strain emitted from 1--4 kHz is
$h_{\rm rss}^{50\%}=2.1\times 10^{-22}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 50% detection
efficiency. For intermediate-duration signals, our best upper limit at 50%
detection efficiency is $h_{\rm rss}^{50\%}=8.4\times 10^{-22}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for
a millisecond magnetar model, and $h_{\rm rss}^{50\%}=5.9\times 10^{-22}$
Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a bar-mode model. These results indicate that post-merger
emission from a similar event may be detectable when advanced detectors reach
design sensitivity or with next-generation detectors.

  Studies using Generalized Estimating Equations",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of a complex disease is an intricate interplay of genetic and
environmental factors. ""Heritability"" is defined as the proportion of total
trait variance due to genetic factors within a given population. Studies with
monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins allow us to estimate heritability by
fitting an ""ACE"" model which estimates the proportion of trait variance
explained by additive genetic (A), common shared environment (C), and unique
non-shared environmental (E) latent effects, thus helping us better understand
disease risk and etiology. In this paper, we develop a flexible generalized
estimating equations framework (""GEE2"") for fitting twin ACE models that
requires minimal distributional assumptions, rather only the first two moments
need to be correctly specified. We prove that two commonly used methods for
estimating heritability, the normal ACE model (""NACE"") and Falconer's method,
can both be fit within this unified GEE2 framework, which additionally provides
robust standard errors. Although the traditional Falconer's method cannot
directly adjust for covariates, we show that the corresponding GEE2 version
(""GEE2-Falconer"") can incorporate covariate effects for both mean and
variance-level parameters (e.g. let heritability vary by sex or age). Given
non-normal data, we show that the GEE2 models attain significantly better
coverage of the true heritability compared to the traditional NACE and
Falconer's methods. Finally, we demonstrate an important scenario where the
NACE model produces biased estimates of heritability while Falconer's method
remains unbiased. Overall, we recommend using the robust and flexible
GEE2-Falconer model for estimating heritability in twin studies.

magnification is essential for estimating the intrinsic properties of
high-redshift galaxy candidates, and properly accounting for the survey volume.
We report on new spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged lensed galaxies
behind these clusters, which are used as constraints, and detail our strategy
to reduce systematic uncertainties due to lack of spectroscopic information. In
addition, we quantify the uncertainty on the lensing magnification due to
statistical and systematic errors related to the lens modeling process, and
find that in all but one cluster, the magnification is constrained to better
than 20% in at least 80% of the field of view, including statistical and
systematic uncertainties. The five clusters presented in this paper span the
range of masses and redshifts of the clusters in the RELICS program. We find
that they exhibit similar strong lensing efficiencies to the clusters targeted

independently segments sections of the fetal brain in 2D fetal MRI slices in

through their decay products, the polarization states interfere among
themselves. Moreover, already at tree level, there are diagrams which cannot be
interpreted as production times decay of EW bosons but are necessary for gauge
invariance.
  We discuss a possible way to define a cross section for polarized $W$'s,
dropping all non resonant diagrams, and projecting on shell the resonant ones,
thus, preserving gauge invariance. In most cases, the sum of polarized
distributions reproduces the full results. In the absence of cuts, the ratios
of the polarized cross sections to the full one agree with the results of a
standard projection on Legendre polynomials. While the latter cannot be

  nucleation site competition and neutralization","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interfacial nucleation is the dominant process of dislocation generation
during the plastic deformation of nano-crystalline materials. Solute additions
intended to stabilize nano-crystalline metals against grain growth, may
segregate to the grain boundaries and triple junctions where they can affect
the process of the dislocation emission. In this Letter we demonstrate that the
effect of solute addition in a nano-crystalline material containing competing
solute segregation sites and dislocation sources can be very complex due to
different rates of segregation at different interfaces. Moreover, at large
concentrations, when the solutes form clusters near the grain boundaries or
triple junctions, the interfaces between these clusters and the matrix can
introduce new dislocation emission sources, which can be activated under lower
applied stress. Thus, the strength maximum can occur at a certain solute
concentration: adding solutes beyond this optimal solute concentration can
reduce the strength of the material.

the sampling strategies employed in actual survey-based datasets. Pairing each
house with a corresponding set of satellite images, we use image-based features
to predict housing prices within each of these degraded samples. To generalize
beyond any given featurization methodology, our system contains an independent
featurization module, which can be interchanged with any preferred image

  Our initial findings demonstrate that while satellite imagery can be used to
predict housing prices with considerable accuracy, the size and nature of the
ground truth sample is a fundamental determinant of the usefulness of imagery
for this category of socioeconomic prediction. We quantify the returns to
improving the distribution and size of observed data, and show that the image
classification method is a second-order concern. Our results provide clear
guidance for the development of adaptive sampling strategies in data-sparse

of performing the optimal projective measurement directly on the system, it is
first entangled to an ancillary system and the measurement is performed on the
ancilla. We show that, by an appropriate choice of the entanglement
transformation, the Helstrom bound can be attained. The advantage of this
approach is twofold. First, it provides a novel implementation when the optimal
projective measurement cannot be directly performed. For example, in the case
of continuous variable states (binary and N phase-shifted coherent signals),
the available detection methods, photon counting and homodyning, are
insufficient to perform the required cat-state projection. In the case of
symmetric states, the square-root measurement is optimal, but it is not easy to
perform directly for more than two states. Our approach provides a feasible
alternative in both cases. Second, the measurement is non-destructive from the
point of view of the original system and one has a certain amount of freedom in
designing the post-measurement state, which can then be processed further.

Hamiltonian dynamical system with a complex projective Hilbert space as its

structure. This paper extends the geometric quantum theory to include aspects
of the symplectic topology of the state space by identifying the
Robertson-Schr\""{o}dinger uncertainty relation for pure quantum states as the
differential version of the energy identity in the theory of $J$-holomorphic
curves. We consider a family of maps from a Riemann surface into a
finite-dimensional quantum state space by using the vector fields generated by
two quantum observables,and show that the Fubini-Study metric tensor pulls back
by such a map to the covariance tensor for the two observables. By calculating
the map energy density in the pull-back metric, the uncertainty relation is
represented as an equality that compares the map energy differential to the sum
of the pull-back of the symplectic form and a positive definite term that
vanishes when the map is holomorphic. Saturation of the
Robertson-Schr\""{o}dinger inequality occurs when the map is conformal and the
off-diagonal covariance terms vanish. For compact Riemann surfaces where such a
map can be globally defined, if the map is holomorphic, it is harmonic and its
image is a minimal surface. In this case, the uncertainty product integral is a
topological invariant that depends only on the homology class of the curve

contrary, the scattering zeros of lossless objects strictly occur at complex
frequencies. While usually considered non-physical due to their divergent

dispersion. Here, we introduce the concept of coherent virtual absorption,
accessing these modes by temporally shaping the incident waveform. We show that
engaging these complex zeros enables storing and releasing the electromagnetic
energy at will within a lossless structure for arbitrary amounts of time, under
the control of the impinging field. The effect is robust with respect to
inevitable material dissipation and can be realized in systems with any number

representative of S0s with high stellar masses ($M_{star}/M_{sun} > 10^{10}$).
They lay mainly on the red sequence and live in relatively isolated
environments similar to that of the field and loose groups. We use our 2D
photometric decomposition to define the size and photometric properties of the
bulges, as well as their location within the galaxies. We perform mock
spectroscopic simulations mimicking our observed galaxies to quantify the
impact of the underlying disc on our bulge kinematic measurements ($\lambda$
and $v/\sigma$). We compare our bulge corrected kinematic measurements with the
results from Schwarzschild dynamical modelling. The good agreement confirms the
robustness of our results and allows us to use bulge reprojected values of
$\lambda$ and $v/\sigma$. We find that the photometric ($n$ and $B/T$) and
kinematic ($v/\sigma$ and $\lambda$) properties of our field S0 bulges are not
correlated. We demonstrate that this morpho-kinematic decoupling is intrinsic
to the bulges and it is not due to projection effects. We conclude that
photometric diagnostics to separate different types of bulges (disc-like vs
classical) might not be useful for S0 galaxies. The morpho-kinematics
properties of S0 bulges derived in this paper suggest that they are mainly
formed by dissipation processes happening at high redshift, but dedicated
high-resolution simulations are necessary to better identify their origin.

many-body gap as the bands are tuned to the effective continuum limit
$n_\phi\to 1/|C|$. Near these points, the Hofstadter model realises large
magnetic unit cells that yield bands with perfectly flat dispersion and Berry
curvature. We exploit the known scaling of energies in the effective continuum
limit in order to maintain a fixed square aspect ratio in finite-size
calculations. Based on exact diagonalization calculations of the band-projected
Hamiltonian, we show that almost all finite-size spectra yield the ground-state
degeneracy predicted by composite fermion theory. We confirm that states at low
ranks in the composite fermion hierarchy are the most robust and yield a clear
gap in the thermodynamic limit. For bosons in $|C|=2$ and $|C|=3$ bands, our
data for the composite fermion states are compatible with a finite gap in the
thermodynamic limit. We also report new evidence for gapped incompressible
states of fermions in $|C|>1$ bands, which have large entanglement gaps. For
cases with a clear spectral gap, we confirm that the thermodynamic limit
commutes with the effective continuum limit. We analyze the nature of the
correlation functions for the Abelian composite fermion states and find that
they feature $|C|^2$ smooth sheets. We examine two cases associated with a
bosonic integer quantum Hall effect (BIQHE): For $\nu=2$ in $|C|=1$ bands, we
find a strong competing state with a higher ground-state degeneracy, so no
clear BIQHE is found in the band-projected Hofstadter model; for $\nu=1$ in
$|C|=2$ bands, we present additional data confirming the existence of a BIQHE
state.

  Minor changes, references added, matches the published version in 'Frontiers

unprecedented accuracy. The upcoming generation of experiments will be
sensitive to subdominant effects that can give information on the unknown
neutrino parameters: the Dirac CP-violating phase, the mass ordering and the
$\theta_{23}$ octant. Determining the exact values of neutrino mass and mixing
parameters is crucial to test neutrino models and flavor symmetries. In the
first part of this review, we summarize the current status of neutrino
oscillation parameters. We consider the most recent data from solar experiments
and the atmospheric data from Super-Kamiokande, IceCube and ANTARES. We
implement the data from the reactor experiments KamLAND, Daya Bay, RENO and
Double Chooz as well as the long baseline data from MINOS, T2K and NOvA. If in
addition to the standard interactions, neutrinos have subdominant Non-Standard
Interactions (NSI) with matter, extracting the values of these parameters will
suffer from new degeneracies. We review such effects and formulate the
conditions on the NSI parameters under which the precision measurement of
neutrino oscillation parameters can be distorted. Like standard weak
interactions, NSI can be categorized into Charged and Neutral Current NSI. Our
focus will be on NC NSI since it is possible to build a class of models giving
rise to sizeable NC NSI with effects on neutrino oscillations. These models are
based on new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry with a boson of mass $\lesssim 10$ MeV. The
UV complete model should be electroweak invariant which implies that along with
neutrinos, charged fermions acquire new interactions on which there are strong
bounds. We enumerate the bounds that exist on such models and show that it is
possible to build viable models avoiding all the bounds. We review methods to
test these models and suggest approaches to break the degeneracies caused by
NSI.

(FBMC/OQAM) is considered by recent research projects as one of the key
enablers for the future 5G air interface. It exhibits better spectral shape and
improves mobility support compared to Orthogonal Frequency-Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) thanks to the use of a time and frequency localized
prototype filter. The choice of this filter is crucial for FBMC/OQAM, due to
its substantial impact on achieved performance and complexity levels. In the
context of 5G, short frame sizes are foreseen in several communication
scenarios to reduce system latency, and therefore short filters are preferred.
In this context, a novel short filter allowing for near perfect reconstruction
and having the same size as one OFDM symbol is proposed. Using Frequency-Spread
(FS) implementation for the FBMC/OQAM receiver, analytical analysis and
simulation results show that the proposed filter exhibits better robustness to
several types of channel impairments when compared to State-of-The-Art (SoTA)

architecture of the filtering stage is proposed, showing lower complexity than
the classical PolyPhase Network (PPN)-based implementation.

As of now, the 50 qubit threshold for quantum supremacy has been determined
largely by the state vector simulation method's exponential space demands
placing an upper bound on simulation memory capabilities. To investigate this
claim, we present and test an implementation of a known path integral
simulation algorithm running in linear space; the method is based on
recursively traversing the underlying computation tree for quantum algorithms

to simulate the hidden subgroup method (HSP) standard method---a notable class
of circuits including Shor's algorithm amongst others---in a reasonable amount
of time using extremely low memory, as well as other circuits with similar

as a feasible alternative to state vector simulation and that with respect to

strongly, but no significant reheating was observed during outburst II. Cooling
from $\sim$333 eV to $\sim$146 eV was observed during the first $\sim$1200 d.
Outburst III reheated the crust up to $\sim$167 eV, after which the crust
cooled again to $\sim$131 eV in $\sim$350 d. We model the thermal evolution of
the crust and find that this source required a different strength and depth of
shallow heating during each of the three outbursts. The shallow heating
released during outburst I was $\sim$17 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$ and outburst III
required $\sim$0.3 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. These cooling observations could not be

well constrained and could vary from $\sim$0--2.2 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$, i.e.,

ensure the vanishing of the cosmological constant, as well as the existence of

self-interactions are consistent with those of Einstein's general relativity,
up to higher-derivative corrections. We also demonstrate in a theory with more

frequency from the power spectral density of the centre of mass signal of the

diameter and the number of layers in the system. We thus find that (i) the LFO
frequency is inversely proportional to the fast inertial time scale and (ii)
decorrelates with a typical decay time proportional to the slow dissipative
time scale in the system. The latter is consistent with the view that the LFO
is driven by the inherent noise that is present in the granular Leidenfrost
state with a low number of particles.

explore the physical conditions that would lead to optimal growth wherein

that a large population of high-$z$ lower-mass black holes that formed in the

recently reverted back to its type 1.9 state. Our ongoing monitoring now
reveals that the AGN has halted its dramatic dimming, reaching a minimum around
October 2016. The minimum was followed by an outburst rising with $\sim$0.25
U-band mag/month. The rebrightening lasted at least until February 2017, as
confirmed by joint Chandra and Hubble observations. Monitoring was resumed in
July 2017 after the source emerged from sunblock, at which point the AGN was
found only $\sim$0.4 mag brighter than its minimum. The intermittent outburst
was accompanied by the appearance of a red wing asymmetry in broad-line shape,
indicative of an inhomogeneous broad-line region. The current flickering
brightness of Mrk 1018 following its rapid fading either suggests that the

over the next few years. Distinguishing between these possibilities requires
continuous multiwavelength monitoring.

the prompt spectrum of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) extends down to the soft X-ray
band. This energy band is particularly important for prompt emission studies,
since it is towards low energies that the observed spectral shape is in
disagreement with the synchrotron predictions. Unfortunately, the number of
cases where XRT started observing the GRB location during the prompt phase is
very limited. In this work we collect a sample of 34 GRBs and perform joint
XRT+BAT spectral analysis of prompt radiation, extending a previous study
focused on the 14 brightest cases. Fermi-GBM observations are included in the
analysis when available (13 cases), allowing the characterization of prompt
spectra from soft X-rays to MeV energies. In $62\%$ of the spectra, the XRT
data reveal a hardening of the spectrum, well described by introducing an
additional, low-energy power-law segment (with index $\alpha_1$) into the
empirical fitting function. The break energy below which the spectrum hardens
takes values between $\rm 3\,keV$ and $\rm 30\,keV$. A second power-law
($\alpha_2$) describes the spectrum between the break energy and the peak
energy. The mean values of the photon indices are
$\langle\alpha_1\rangle=-0.51$ ($\sigma=0.29$) and
$\langle\alpha_2\rangle=-1.54$ ($\sigma=0.26$). These are consistent, within
one $\sigma$, with the synchrotron values in fast cooling regime. As a test, if
we exclude XRT data from the fits we find typical results: the spectrum below
the peak energy is described by a power law with $\langle\alpha\rangle=-1.15$.
This shows the relevance of soft X-ray data in revealing prompt emission
spectra consistent with synchrotron spectra. Finally, we do not find any
correlation between the presence of the X-ray break energy and the flux,
fluence or duration of the prompt emission.

the past years. One very extreme event was the superflare from the young
M-dwarf DG CVn binary star system, which triggered Swift/BAT as if it was a
$\gamma$-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we estimate the expected $\gamma$-ray
emission from DG CVn and the most extreme stellar flares by extrapolating from
solar flares based on measured solar energetic particles (SEPs), as well as
thermal and non-thermal emission properties. We find that ions are plausibly
accelerated in stellar superflares to 100 GeV energies, and possibly up to TeV
energies in the associated coronal mass ejections. The corresponding
$\pi^0$-decay $\gamma$-ray emission could be detectable from stellar
superflares with ground-based $\gamma$-ray telescopes. On the other hand, the
detection of $\gamma$-ray emission implies particle densities high enough that
ions suffer significant losses due to inelastic proton-proton scattering. The
next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to probe
superflares from M-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood and constrain the energy

falling onto a stellar mass black hole based on the three-dimensional general
relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (3D-GRRMHD) simulation data.
Assuming that the gas clouds radiate due mainly to the free-free emission
and/or optically thick, inverse Compton scattering, we calculate how the
emissivity distributions develop with time. We find that (1) gas clouds, each
of which has a ring-like or arc shape, are intermittently formed, and that (2)
they slowly fall to the black hole, keeping nearly the Keplerian orbital
velocity. These features support the dynamical properties of the gas clouds
assumed in the spin measurement method proposed by Moriyama & Mineshige 2015,
but the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk is larger than that of
the marginally stable orbit (ISCO). Next, we examine how each gas cloud is
observed by a distant observer by calculating the photon trajectories in the
black hole space-time. The luminosity of the accretion flow exhibits
significant time variations on different timescales, reflecting the time
evolution of the gas density distributions. The relatively slow variations on
the time durations of 0.08-0.10 sec is due to the formation and fall of gas
clouds, while quasi-periodic flux peaks with short time intervals (0.01 sec)
are due to the quasi-periodic enhancement of light from the non-axisymmetric
arc-shaped clouds through the beaming effect. This may account for the
high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in black hole
binaries. The observational implications and future issues are briefly

nonlocal mirror symmetry to an onsite $\mathbb{Z}_2$ layer-exchange symmetry
after folding the SET along the mirror axis, so that we can gauge the symmetry;
(ii) it maps all mirror SET information into the boundary properties of the

conjecture that these constraints may be complete, in the sense that all

justify this. Previously known general results on the classification and

photoevaporating disc. We aim to analyse the DZ Cha star + disc system to
identify the mechanism driving the evolution of this object. We have analysed
three epochs of high resolution optical spectroscopy, photometry from the UV up
to the sub-mm regime, infrared spectroscopy, and J-band imaging polarimetry
observations of DZ Cha. Combining our analysis with previous studies we find no
signatures of accretion in the $\Ha$ line profile in nine epochs covering a
time baseline of $\sim20$ years. The optical spectra are dominated by
chromospheric emission lines, but they also show emission from the forbidden
lines [SII] 4068 and [OI] 6300$\,\AA$ that indicate a disc outflow. The
polarized images reveal a dust depleted cavity of $\sim7$ au in radius and two
spiral-like features, and we derive a disc dust mass limit of
$M_\mathrm{dust}<3\MEarth$ from the sub-mm photometry. No stellar ($M_\star >
80 \MJup$) companions are detected down to $0\farcs07$ ($\sim 8$ au,
projected). The negligible accretion rate, small cavity, and forbidden line
emission strongly suggests that DZ Cha is currently at the initial stages of
disc clearing by photoevaporation. At this point the inner disc has drained and
the inner wall of the truncated outer disc is directly exposed to the stellar
radiation. We argue that other mechanisms like planet formation or binarity
cannot explain the observed properties of DZ Cha. The scarcity of objects like
this one is in line with the dispersal timescale ($\lesssim 10^5$ yr) predicted
by this theory. DZ Cha is therefore an ideal target to study the initial stages
of photoevaporation.

inequalities for quantum Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels model the
propagation of electromagnetic waves through optical fibers and free space in

rates achievable by quantum communication devices for communication and quantum
key distribution. The first inequality proven in this thesis is the quantum
Entropy Power Inequality, which provides a lower bound to the output entropy of
the beam-splitter or of the squeezing in terms of the entropies of the two
inputs. The second inequality states that Gaussian states minimize the output
entropy of the one-mode quantum Gaussian attenuator among all the input states
with a given entropy, and was a longstanding conjecture in quantum
communication theory. The generalization of this inequality to the multimode
attenuator would determine its triple trade-off region and its capacity region
for broadcast communication to two receivers. The thesis contains further
results in Gaussian quantum information, quantum statistical mechanics and
relativistic quantum information. The most important of these results concerns
the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The ETH is an assumption in
quantum statistical mechanics stating that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian

may be fundamentally related to host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$). To
investigate this SMBH growth-$M_\star$ relation in detail, we calculate
long-term SMBH accretion rate as a function of $M_\star$ and redshift
[$\overline{\rm BHAR}(M_\star, z)$] over ranges of
$\log(M_\star/M_\odot)=\text{9.5--12}$ and $z=\text{0.4--4}$. Our
$\overline{\rm BHAR}(M_\star, z)$ is constrained by high-quality survey data
(GOODS-South, GOODS-North, and COSMOS), and by the stellar mass function and
the X-ray luminosity function. At a given $M_\star$, $\overline{\rm BHAR}$ is
higher at high redshift. This redshift dependence is stronger in more massive
systems (for $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\approx 11.5$, $\overline{\rm BHAR}$ is
three decades higher at $z=4$ than at $z=0.5$), possibly due to AGN feedback.
Our results indicate that the ratio between $\overline{\rm BHAR}$ and average
star formation rate ($\overline{\rm SFR}$) rises toward high $M_\star$ at a
given redshift. This $\overline{\rm BHAR}/\overline{\rm SFR}$ dependence on
$M_\star$ does not support the scenario that SMBH and galaxy growth are in
lockstep. We calculate SMBH mass history [$M_{\rm BH}(z)$] based on our
$\overline{\rm BHAR}(M_\star, z)$ and the $M_\star(z)$ from the literature, and
find that the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_\star$ relation has weak redshift evolution since
$z\approx 2$. The $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio is higher toward massive galaxies:
it rises from $\approx 1/5000$ at $\log M_\star\lesssim 10.5$ to $\approx
1/500$ at $\log M_\star \gtrsim 11.2$. Our predicted $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio
at high $M_\star$ is similar to that observed in local giant ellipticals,
suggesting that SMBH growth from mergers is unlikely to dominate over growth
from accretion.

In practice, free probability theory can give a good approximation of the

  We develop a technique based on eigenvector localization/delocalization that
works very well for important problems of interest where free probability is
not sufficient, but certain uniformity properties apply. The

recover, for M51a, a peak star formation rate (SFR) between 0.1 and 5 Gyr ago,
with much lower star formation activity over the last 100 Myr. For M51b, we
find a declining SFR toward the present day. In the outskirt regions of M51a,

vary across M51, and (2) provide first-order estimates for how the IR
luminosity per unit stellar mass varies as a function of the stellar age. From

the absolute value and phase) eventually becomes disordered, which involves
fluctuations of both its phase and (at higher T) its absolute value. In order

efficiency is nonlinear in time. We find that jets have only a small effect (of
order 25\%) on the accretion rate onto the protostellar disk (the ""raw""
accretion rate). We show that the small scale structure -- the radial density,
velocity, and mass accretion profiles are very similar in the jet and no-jet
cases. Finally, we show that the inclusion of jets does drive turbulence but
only on small (parsec) scales.

galaxy mergers; they shrink via dynamical friction and stellar scatterings,
until gravitational waves (GWs) bring them to the final coalescence. It has
been argued that BHBs may stall at a parsec scale and never enter the GW stage
if stars are not continuously supplied to the BHB loss cone. Here we perform
several N-body experiments to study the effect of an 80,000 solar masses
stellar cluster (SC) infalling on a parsec-scale BHB. We explore different
orbital elements for the SC and we perform runs both with and without
accounting for the influence of a rigid stellar cusp (modelled as a rigid
Dehnen potential). We find that the semi-major axis of the BHB shrinks by more
than 10 per cent if the SC is on a nearly radial orbit; the shrinking is more
efficient when a Dehnen potential is included and the orbital plane of the SC
coincides with that of the BHB. In contrast, if the SC orbit has non-zero
angular momentum, only a few stars enter the BHB loss cone and the resulting
BHB shrinking is negligible. Our results indicate that SC disruption might
significantly contribute to the shrinking of a parsec-scale BHB only if the SC
approaches the BHB on a nearly radial orbit.

such algorithms complement existing signature-based methods but promise

of heterogeneous log data; hence, AD in such operations involves multiple
(e.g., per IP, per data type) ensembles of detectors modeling heterogeneous
characteristics (e.g., rate, size, type) often with adaptive online models
producing alerts in near real time. Because of high data volume, setting the
threshold for each detector in such a system is an essential yet underdeveloped
configuration issue that, if slightly mistuned, can leave the system useless,
either producing a myriad of alerts and flooding downstream systems, or giving
none. In this work, we build on the foundations of Ferragut et al. to provide a
set of rigorous results for understanding the relationship between threshold
values and alert quantities, and we propose an algorithm for setting the
threshold in practice. Specifically, we give an algorithm for setting the
threshold of multiple, heterogeneous, possibly dynamic detectors completely a
priori, in principle. Indeed, if the underlying distribution of the incoming
data is known (closely estimated), the algorithm provides provably manageable
thresholds. If the distribution is unknown (e.g., has changed over time) our
analysis reveals how the model distribution differs from the actual
distribution, indicating a period of model refitting is necessary. We provide
empirical experiments showing the efficacy of the capability by regulating the
alert rate of a system with $\approx$2,500 adaptive detectors scoring over 1.5M
events in 5 hours. Further, we demonstrate on the real network data and

dependence of dust opacity allows for an intermediate case in which starlight

non-negligible force in this intermediate regime. We address all three regimes

their ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, a
well established measure of RNNs long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus
formal understanding of the effect of depth on their ability to correlate data
throughout time is limited. Specifically, existing depth efficiency results on
convolutional networks do not suffice in order to account for the success of
deep RNNs on data of varying lengths. In order to address this, we introduce a
measure of the network's ability to support information flow across time,
referred to as the Start-End separation rank, which reflects the distance of
the function realized by the recurrent network from modeling no dependency
between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep
recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are combinatorially
higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Thus, we establish
that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent
networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of
quantifying this key attribute which may be readily extended to other RNN
architectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our
results by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent
Arithmetic Circuits, which merge the hidden state with the input via the
Multiplicative Integration operation, and empirically demonstrate the discussed
phenomena on common RNNs. Finally, we employ the tool of quantum Tensor
Networks to gain additional graphic insight regarding the complexity brought

outflows observed in luminous quasars can be explained by molecule formation

space, due to their computational cost. We have therefore developed an analytic
model to follow cooling in the shocked ISM layer of an AGN wind. We explore
different ambient densities ($1-10^{4} \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$), density profile
slopes ($0-1.5$), AGN luminosities ($10^{44}-10^{47} \, \rm{erg} \,
\rm{s}^{-1}$), and metallicities ($0.1-3 \rm{Z}_{\odot}$). The swept up gas
mostly cools within ~1 Myr. Based on our previous simulations, we predict that
this gas would produce observable molecular outflows. The instantaneous
momentum boost initially increases as the outflow decelerates. However, it
reaches a maximum of $\approx$20, due to work done against the gravitational
potential. The predicted time-averaged observational estimate of the molecular
outflow momentum boost reaches a maximum of $\approx1-2$, partly due to our
assumed molecular fraction, 0.2, but also because the instantaneous and
observational, time-averaged definitions are not equivalent. Thus recent
observational estimates of order unity momentum boosts do not necessarily rule
out energy-driven outflows. Finally, we find that dust grains are likely to
re-form by accretion of metals after the shocked ISM layer has cooled, assuming
that a small fraction of dust grains swept up after this layer has cooled are
able to mix into the cool phase, and assuming that grain growth remains
efficient in the presence of the strong AGN radiation field. This would enable
rapid molecule formation, as assumed in our models.

power-law background-model for the field stars. This modeling results in
estimates of the mean stream distance precise to ${\sim}1\%$ and it resolves
the stream's line-of-sight depth. These improved geometric constraints can
serve as new constraints for dynamical stream models.

across interfaces is traditionally assumed to add resistance to heat transfer,
decreasing the thermal boundary conductance (TBC).$^1$ However, recent
computational works have suggested that interfacial defects can enhance this
thermal boundary conductance through emergence of unique vibrations that are
intrinsic to the material interface and defect atoms,$^{2-6}$ a finding that
contradicts traditional theory and conventional understanding. By manipulating
the local heat flux of atomic vibrations that comprise these interfacial modes,
in principle, the TBC can be increased. In this work, we provide evidence that
interfacial defects can enhance the TBC across interfaces through the emergence
of unique high frequency vibrational modes that arise from atomic mass defects
at the interface with relatively small masses. We demonstrate ultrahigh TBC at
amorphous SiOC:H/SiC:H interfaces, approaching 1 GW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, that is
further increased through the introduction of nitrogen defects. The fact that
disordered interfaces can exhibit such high conductances, which can be further
increased with additional defects offers a unique direction in controlling
interfacial thermal transport that becomes important in manipulating heat
transfer across materials with high densities of interfaces.

captured by sensors are noisy. This paper illustrates that noisy gestures
degrade training and classification accuracy for gesture recognition in
state-of-the-art deterministic Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We introduce a new
statistical quantization approach that mitigates these problems by (1) during
training, producing gesture-specific codebooks, HMMs, and error models for
gesture sequences; and (2) during classification, exploiting the error model to
explore multiple feasible HMM state sequences. We implement classification in
Uncertain<t>, a probabilistic programming system that encapsulates HMMs and
error models and then automates sampling and inference in the runtime.
Uncertain<T> developers directly express a choice of application-specific
trade-off between recall and precision at gesture recognition time, rather than
at training time. We demonstrate benefits in configurability, precision,
recall, and recognition on two data sets with 25 gestures from 28 people and
4200 total gestures. Incorporating gesture error more accurately in modeling
improves the average recognition rate of 20 gestures from 34\% in prior work to
62\%. Incorporating the error model during classification further improves the
average gesture recognition rate to 71\%. As far as we are aware, no prior work
shows how to generate an HMM error model during training and use it to improve

significant structure in 6 out of 7 galaxies. The most common distance between
the peaks in velocity dispersion and emission line peaks is $\sim0.5$~kpc, we
note this is very similar to the average size of a clump measured with HST
H$\alpha$ maps. This could suggest that the peaks in velocity dispersion in
clumpy galaxies likely arise due to some interaction between the clump and the

between outflows, inflows or velocity shear. Observations covering a wider area

mutant cells can invade by increasing their chirality or switching their

between the mutant and the ancestor depending on their relative chirality. For
large chiralities, the coexistence is accompanied by strong intermixing between
the cells, while spatial segregation occurs otherwise. We show that the
competition within the aggregate is mediated by bulges in regions where the
cells with different chiralities meet. The two-way coupling between aggregate
shape and natural selection is described by the chiral Kardar-Parisi-Zhang

supported by steady helium burning, adding mass to the WD core until it reaches
$M_{\rm core}\approx 1.12-1.20 M_\odot$. At that point, the base of the surface
convection zone extends into the burning layer, mixing the helium burning
products (primarily carbon and magnesium) throughout the convective envelope.
Further evolution depletes the convective envelope of helium, and dramatically
slows the mass increase of the underlying WD core. The WD core mass growth
re-initiates after helium depletion, as then an uncoupled carbon burning shell
is ignited and proceeds to burn the fuel from the remaining metal-rich extended
envelope. For large enough initial total merger masses, O/Ne WD cores would
experience electron-capture triggered collapse to neutron stars (NSs) after
growing to near Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$). Massive C/O WD cores could
suffer the same fate after a carbon-burning flame converts them to O/Ne. The NS
formation would release ${\approx}10^{50}$ ergs into the remaining extended low

cancellation techniques to determine cosmological parameters, and use of
cross-correlation measurements to break parameter degeneracies. Assuming large
sky overlap between CMB-S4 and LSST, we show that a joint analysis of CMB-S4
lensing and LSST clustering can yield very tight constraints on the matter
amplitude $\sigma_8(z)$, halo bias, and $f_\mathrm{NL}$, competitive with the
best stage IV experiment predictions, but using complementary methods, which
may carry different and possibly lower systematics. Having no sky overlap
between experiments degrades the precision of $\sigma_8(z)$ by a factor of 20,

precision always degrades by an order of magnitude or more, showing that a
joint analysis is critical. Our results also suggest that CMB lensing in

that is not well tested observationally. We explore predictions against other

consuming a good from its flexibility set are its private information. We adopt
the flexibility model of [1] and focus on the case of nested flexibility sets

settings with this inherent nested structure are provided. On the supply side,
we assume that the seller has an initial stock of free supply but it can
purchase more goods for each of the nested sets at fixed exogenous prices. We
characterize the allocation and purchase rules for a profit-maximizing,
Bayesian incentive compatible and individually rational mechanism as the
solution to an integer program. The optimal payment function is pinned down by
the optimal allocation rule in the form of an integral equation. We show that
the nestedness of flexibility sets can be exploited to obtain a simple
description of the optimal allocations, purchases and payments in terms of
thresholds that can be computed through a straightforward iterative procedure.

the dependencies (edges) between them. Learning a useful feature representation
from graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks
such as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others.
Many existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or
estimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task.
Examples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as
well as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk
used by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This
has three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently
transductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second,
they are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which
is impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support
for attributed graphs.
  To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework for
inductive network representation learning based on the notion of attributed
random walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning
a function $\Phi : \mathrm{\rm \bf x} \rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute
vector $\mathrm{\rm \bf x}$ to a type $w$. This framework serves as a basis for
generalizing existing methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and many other

some discrete lattices in one, two and three dimensions associated to weight

between the fluid and radiation, specifically, free-free, bound-free,
bound-bound and electron scattering. We explore various initial conditions,
with different radiation energy densities of the beam in hydrodynamical and
radiation pressure dominated scenarios, considering only ultra-relativistic
jets. In order to investigate the impact of the radiation field on the
evolution of the jets, we compare our results with purely hydrodynamical jets.
Comparing among jets driven by RRH, we find that radiation pressure dominated
jets propagate slightly faster than gas pressure dominated ones. Finally, we
construct the luminosity Light Curves (LCs) associated with all these cases.
The construction of LCs uses the fluxes of the radiation field which is fully
coupled to the hydrodynamics equations during the evolution. The main
properties of the jets propagating on the stratified surrounding medium are
that the LCs show the same order of magnitude as the gamma-ray luminosity of
typical Long Gamma-Ray Bursts $10^{50}-10^{54}$erg/s and the difference between
the radiation and gas temperatures is of nearly one order of magnitude. The
properties of jets breaking out from the progenitor star model are that the LCs
are of the order of magnitude of low-luminosity GRBs $10^{46}-10^{49}$ erg/s,

matrix convolutions were identified which were called P\'olya ensembles (or
polynomial ensembles of derivative type). Those ensembles are closed under the
respective convolutions and, thus, build a semi-group when adding by hand a
unit element. They even have a semi-group action on the polynomial ensembles.
Moreover in several works transformations of the bi-orthogonal functions and
kernels of a given polynomial ensemble were derived when performing an additive
or multiplicative matrix convolution with particular P\'olya ensembles. For the
multiplicative matrix convolution on the complex square matrices the
transformations were even done for general P\'olya ensembles. In the present
work we generalize these results to the additive convolution on Hermitian
matrices, on Hermitian anti-symmetric matrices, on Hermitian anti-self-dual
matrices and on rectangular complex matrices. For this purpose we derive the
bi-orthogonal functions and the corresponding kernel for a general P\'olya
ensemble which was not done before. With the help of these results we find
transformation formulas for the convolution with a fixed matrix or a random
matrix drawn from a general polynomial ensemble. As an example we consider
P\'olya ensembles with an associated weight which is a P\'olya frequency
function of infinite order. But we also explicitly evaluate the Gaussian
unitary ensemble as well as the complex Laguerre (aka Wishart, Ginibre or
chiral Gaussian unitary) ensemble. All results hold for finite matrix
dimension. Furthermore we derive a recursive relation between Toeplitz
determinants which appears as a by-product of our results.

motivated in this work by the example of traffic weaving, e.g., at highway
on-ramps/off-ramps, where entering and exiting cars must swap lanes in a short
distance---a challenging negotiation even for experienced drivers due to the
inherent multimodal uncertainty of who will pass whom. Our approach is to learn
multimodal probability distributions over future human actions from a dataset
of human-human exemplars and perform real-time robot policy construction in the
resulting environment model through massively parallel sampling of human
responses to candidate robot action sequences. Direct learning of these
distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional
variational autoencoders (CVAEs), whereby we learn action distributions
simultaneously conditioned on the present interaction history, as well as
candidate future robot actions in order to take into account response dynamics.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a human-in-the-loop

provide a plethora of information about the underlying network structures, as
well as many other benefits behind their construction. Recently there has been
a considerable increase in interest for the better understanding and modeling
of networks, but the vast majority of this work has been for unsigned networks.
However, many networks can have positive and negative links(or signed
networks), especially in online social media, and they inherently have
properties not found in unsigned networks due to the added complexity.
Specifically, the positive to negative link ratio and the distribution of
signed triangles in the networks are properties that are unique to signed
networks and would need to be explicitly modeled. This is because their
underlying dynamics are not random, but controlled by social theories, such as
Structural Balance Theory, which loosely states that users in social networks
will prefer triadic relations that involve less tension. Therefore, we propose
a model based on Structural Balance Theory and the unsigned Transitive Chung-Lu
model for the modeling of signed networks. Our model introduces two parameters
that are able to help maintain the positive link ratio and proportion of
balanced triangles. Empirical experiments on three real-world signed networks
demonstrate the importance of designing models specific to signed networks
based on social theories to obtain better performance in maintaining signed
network properties while generating synthetic networks.

paradigms has been increased in the last ten years. Usually, the Bayesian
techniques can be implemented to incorporate the uncertainties associated with

into the FEM updating procedure. In this case, the posterior distribution
function describes the uncertainty in the FE model prediction and the
experimental data. Due to the complexity of the modeled systems, the analytical
solution for the posterior distribution function may not exist. This leads to
the use of numerical methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, to
obtain approximate solutions for the posterior distribution function. In this
paper, a Differential Evaluation Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DE-MC) method is
used to approximate the posterior function and update FEMs. The main idea of
the DE-MC approach is to combine the Differential Evolution, which is an
effective global optimization algorithm over real parameter space, with Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to generate samples from the posterior
distribution function. In this paper, the DE-MC method is discussed in detail
while the performance and the accuracy of this algorithm are investigated by

we focus on the most direct approach to study these heterogeneities: we
identify clusters of slow particles and determine their size, $N_c$, and their
radius of gyration, $R_G$. We show that $N_c\propto R_G^{d_f}$, providing
direct evidence that the most immobile particles arrange in fractal objects
with a fractal dimension, $d_f$, that is observed to increase with packing
fraction $\phi$. The cluster size distribution obeys scaling, approaching an
algebraic decay in the limit of structural arrest, i.e., $\phi\to\phi_c$.
Alternatively, dynamical heterogeneities are analyzed via the four-point
structure factor $S_4(q,t)$ and the dynamical susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$.
$S_4(q,t)$ is shown to obey scaling in the full range of packing fractions,
$0.6\leq\phi\leq 0.805$, and to become increasingly long-ranged as
$\phi\to\phi_c$. Finite size scaling of $\chi_4(t)$ provides a consistency
check for the previously analyzed divergences of $\chi_4(t)\propto
(\phi-\phi_c)^{-\gamma_{\chi}}$ and the correlation length $\xi\propto
(\phi-\phi_c)^{-\gamma_{\xi}}$. We check the robustness of our results with
respect to our definition of mobility. The divergences and the scaling for
$\phi\to\phi_c$ suggest a non-equilibrium glass transition which seems
qualitatively independent of the coefficient of restitution.

the surface code. However, these approaches are not scalable as the training

this work the existence of local decoders for higher dimensional codes leads us
to use a low-depth convolutional neural network to locally assign a likelihood
of error on each qubit. For noiseless syndrome measurements, numerical
simulations show that the decoder has a threshold of around $7.1\%$ when
applied to the 4D toric code. When the syndrome measurements are noisy, the
decoder performs better for larger code sizes when the error probability is

Generalised Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM). In order to evaluate its
performance and features, system-level studies should be undertaken in a range
of scenarios. These studies, however, require highly complex computations if
they are performed using bit-level simulators. In this paper, the Mutual
Information (MI) based link quality model (PHY abstraction), which has been
regularly used to implement system-level studies for Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM), is applied to GFDM. The performance of the GFDM
waveform using this model and the bit-level simulation performance is measured
using different channel types. Moreover, a system-level study for a GFDM based
LTE-A system in a realistic scenario, using both a bit-level simulator and this
abstraction model, has been studied and compared. The results reveal the
accuracy of this model using realistic channel data. Based on these results,
the PHY abstraction technique can be applied to evaluate the performance of
GFDM based systems in an effective manner with low complexity. The maximum
difference in the Packet Error Rate (PER) and throughput results in the
abstraction case compared to bit-level simulation does not exceed 4% whilst
offering a simulation time saving reduction of around 62,000 times.

topologies of signed directed social appraisal networks. In this paper, we
propose two discrete-time dynamical systems that explain how an appraisal
network \textcolor{blue}{converges to} social balance from an initially
unbalanced configuration. These two models are based on two different
socio-psychological mechanisms respectively: the homophily mechanism and the
influence mechanism. Our main theoretical contribution is a comprehensive
analysis for both models in three steps. First, we establish the well-posedness
and bounded evolution of the interpersonal appraisals. Second, we fully
characterize the set of equilibrium points; for both models, each equilibrium
network is composed by an arbitrary number of complete subgraphs satisfying
structural balance. Third, we establish the equivalence among three distinct
properties: non-vanishing appraisals, convergence to all-to-all appraisal
networks, and finite-time achievement of social balance. In addition to
theoretical analysis, Monte Carlo validations illustrates how the non-vanishing
appraisal condition holds for generic initial conditions in both models.
Moreover, numerical comparison between the two models indicate that the
homophily-based model might be a more universal explanation for the formation
of social balance. Finally, adopting the homophily-based model, we present
numerical results on the mediation and globalization of local conflicts, the
competition for allies, and the asymptotic formation of a single versus two
factions.

framework for training deep neural networks on datasets with limited labeled
samples using cross-network knowledge projection which is able to improve the
network performance while reducing the overall computational complexity
significantly. Specifically, a large pre-trained teacher network is used to
observe samples from the training data. A projection matrix is learned to
project this teacher-level knowledge and its visual representations from an
intermediate layer of the teacher network to an intermediate layer of a thinner

intermediate layers from the teacher network and the injection layers from the
student network are adaptively selected during training by evaluating a joint
loss function in an iterative manner. This knowledge projection framework
allows us to use crucial knowledge learned by large networks to guide the

experimental results on benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our proposed

storage using a queueing system model, which we refer to as leakage queue. When
the average net charge is positive, we discover that the leakage queue operates
in one of two regimes: a leakage-dominated regime and a capacity-dominated
regime. We find that in the leakage-dominated regime, the stored energy
stabilizes at a point that is below the storage capacity. Under suitable
independence assumptions for energy supply and demand, the stored energy in
this regime closely follows a normal distribution. We present two methods for
computing probabilities of underflow and overflow at a leakage queue. The
methods are validated in a numerical example where the energy supply resembles
a wind energy source.

an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps

establish the relations between velocity dispersion, ages, metallicities [M/H]

dispersion and [alpha/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations are steep and tight.
The age-velocity dispersion relation is flat, with zero point changes
reflecting passive evolution. The scatter in all three parameters are within
0.08-0.15 dex at fixed velocity dispersions, indicating a large degree of
synchronization in the evolution of the galaxies. We find indication of

effective technique for improving performance and energy efficiency of
data-intensive workloads. However, leveraging NDP in realistic systems with
multiple memory modules introduces a new challenge. In today's systems, where
no computation occurs in memory modules, the physical address space is
interleaved at a fine granularity among all memory modules to help improve the
utilization of processor-memory interfaces by distributing the memory traffic.
However, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful
placement of data in memory modules such that near-data computations and their
exclusively used data can be localized in individual memory modules, while
distributing shared data among memory modules to reduce hotspots. In order to
address this new challenge, we propose a set of techniques that (1) enable
collections of OS pages to either be fine-grain interleaved among memory
modules (as is done today) or to be placed contiguously on individual memory
modules (as is desirable for NDP private data), and (2) decide whether to
localize or distribute each memory object based on its anticipated access
pattern and steer computations to the memory where the data they access is
located. Our evaluations across a wide range of workloads show that the
proposed mechanism improves performance by 31% and reduces 38% remote data
accesses over a baseline system that cannot exploit computate-data affinity
characteristics.

manifolds that are constructed from finite dimensional Hopf algebras, namely,
the Kuperberg invariant and the Hennings-Kauffman-Radford invariant. The two
invariants can be viewed as a non-semisimple generalization of the
Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury $(\text{TVBW})$ invariant and the
Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev $(\text{WRT})$ invariant, respectively. By a
classical result relating $\text{TVBW}$ and $\text{WRT}$, it follows that the
Kuperberg invariant for a semisimple Hopf algebra is equal to the
Hennings-Kauffman-Radford invariant for the Drinfeld double of the Hopf
algebra. However, whether the relation holds for non-semisimple Hopf algebras
has remained open, partly because the introduction of framings in this case
makes the Kuperberg invariant significantly more complicated to handle. We give
an affirmative answer to this question. An important ingredient in the proof
involves using a special Heegaard diagram in which one family of circles gives
the surgery link of the three manifold represented by the Heegaard diagram.

the phonon gas model-based diffuse mismatch models (DMM) and atomistic Green's

to previous experimental data, suggest that the TBC can be influenced by long
wavelength, zone center modes in a material on one side of the interface as
opposed to the ""vibrational mismatch"" concept assumed in the DMM; this
disagreement is pronounced at high temperatures. At room temperature, we
measure the ZnO/GaN TBC as $490\lbrack +150, -110\rbrack$ MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$.
The disagreement among the DMM and AGF and the experimental data these elevated

contributing to TBC that not accounted for in the fundamental assumptions of
these harmonic formalisms, such as inelastic scattering. Given the high quality
of these ZnO/GaN interface, these results provide an invaluable critical and

is called an isomorphism between $G$ and $H$ if $(\phi v_i)(\phi v_j)\in E(H)$
$\Leftrightarrow$ $v_i v_j\in E(G)$, $\forall v_i,v_j \in V(G)$. In the case
that $G = H$, we say $\phi$ an automorphism of $G$ and denote the group
consisting of all automorphisms of $G$ by $\mathrm{Aut}~G$. As well-known, the
problem of determining whether or not two given graphs are isomorphic is called
Graph Isomorphism Problem (GI). One of key steps in resolving GI is to work out
the partition $\Pi^*_G$ of $V(G)$ composed of orbits of $\mathrm{Aut}~G$. By
means of geometric features of $\Pi^*_G$ and combinatorial constructions such
as the multipartite graph $[\Pi^*_{t_1},\cdots,\Pi^*_{t_s}]$, we can reduce the
problem of determining $\Pi_G^*$ to that of working out a series of partitions
of $V(G)$ each of which consists of orbits of a stabilizer that fixes a
sequence of vertices of $G$, and thus the determination of the partition
$\Pi^*_v$ is a critical transition.
  On the other hand, we have for a given subspace $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ a
permutation group $\mathrm{Aut}~U := \{ \sigma \in S_n : \sigma ~ U = U \}$. As
a matter of fact, $\mathrm{Aut}~G = \cap_{\lambda \in \mathrm{spec}
\mathbf{A}(G) } \mathrm{Aut}~V_{\lambda}$, and moreover we can obtain a good
approximation $\Pi[ \oplus V_{\lambda} ; v ]$ to $\Pi_v^*$ by analyzing a
decomposition of $V_{\lambda}$ resulted from the division of $V_{\lambda}$ by
subspaces $\{ \mathrm{proj}[ V_{\lambda} ]( \pmb{e}_v )^{\perp} : v \in V(G)
\}$. In fact, there is a close relation among subspaces spanned by cells of
$\Pi[ \oplus V_{\lambda} ; v ]$ of $G$, which enables us to determine $\Pi_v^*$
more efficiently. In virtue of that, we devise a deterministic algorithm
solving GI in time $n^{ O( \log n ) }$.

February 2016. Of these events, approximately half are classified as
white-light flares (WLFs), whereas the remaining events do not show any
enhancements of the visible continuum (non-WLF; NWL). In order to determine the
existence of WL emission, running difference images of not only the Hinode/SOT
WL (G-band, blue, green, and red filter) data but also the Solar Dynamics
Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager continuum data are used. A
comparison between these two groups of WL data in terms of duration,
temperature, emission measure of GOES soft X-rays, distance between EUV flare
ribbons, strength of hard X-rays, and photospheric magnetic field strength was
undertaken. In this statistical study, WLF events are characterized by a
shorter time-scale and shorter ribbon distance compared with NWL events. From
the scatter plots of the duration of soft X-rays and the energy of non-thermal
electrons, a clear distinction between WLF and NWL events can be made. It is
found that the precipitation of large amounts of accelerated electrons within a
short time period plays a key role in generating WL enhancements. Finally, it
was demonstrated that the coronal magnetic field strength in the flare region
is one of the most important factors that allow the individual identification
of WLF events from NWL events.

avoiding interference to IU receivers. But since receivers are passive when in
the receive mode and cannot be detected, the network topology can be used to
predict the potential receivers of a currently active transmitter. For this
purpose, this paper proposes a method to detect the directed links between IUs
of time multiplexing communication networks from their transmission start and
end times. It models the response mechanism of commonly used communication
protocols using Granger causality: the probability of an IU starting a
transmission after another IU's transmission ends increases if the former is a
receiver of the latter. This paper proposes a non-parametric test statistic for
detecting such behavior. To help differentiate between a response and the
opportunistic access of available spectrum, the same test statistic is used to
estimate the response time of each link. The causal structure of the response
is studied through a discrete time Markov chain that abstracts the IUs' medium
access protocol and focuses on the response time and response probability of 2
IUs. Through NS-3 simulations, it is shown that the proposed algorithm
outperforms existing methods in accurately learning the topologies of
infrastructure-based networks and that it can infer the directed data flow in
ad hoc networks with finer time resolution than an existing method.

statistical ensemble in phase space. The purpose of our work is to show that it
is possible to establish an alternative autonomous formalism of quantum
mechanics in phase space using statistical methodology. The adopted perspective
leads to obtaining within the framework of its theory the master
quantum-mechanical equation without recourse to the other formalisms of quantum
mechanics, and gives the idea of operators pertaining to dynamical quantities.
The derivation of this equation starts with the ensemble in phase space. We
have explained with the help of this equation the structure of quantum
mechanics in phase space and the approximation to the Schrodinger equation.
Furthermore, we have shown that this formalism provides reasonable results of
quantization by dealing with some simple cases, which confirm the validity of
this formalism. In particular, we have demonstrated that this formalism can
easily give the relativistic wave equation without treating the problem of
linearizing the Hamiltonian operator by making the most of the point that the
master equation is a first-order partial differential equation with respect to
time, position and momentum variables, and makes use of the phase velocity. The
ultimate outcome this formalism produces is that primary and general matters of
quantum mechanics can be studied reasonably within the framework of statistical
mechanics.

RUM's performance in the bAbI Question Answering task is comparable to that of

cycles changed from 40 ka to ~100 ka. It is broadly accepted that the 40 ka
glacial cycles were driven by cyclical changes in obliquity. However, this
forcing does not explain the ~100 ka glacial cycles. Mechanisms have been
proposed for ~100 ka cycles, but none are universally accepted. Any proposed
mechanism for ~100 ka glacial cycles must give the Earth's climate system a
memory of tens-of-thousands-of-years. This timescale is difficult to achieve
for surface processes, however it is possible for the solid Earth. Recent work
suggests volcanic CO2 emissions change in response to glacial cycles and that
there could be a ~50 ka delay in that response. Such a lagged response could
drive glacial cycles from 40 ka cycles to an integer multiple of the forcing
period. Under what conditions could the climate system admit such a response?
We investigate this using a reduced-complexity model to establish the threshold
volcanic variations required to induce 100 ka glacial cycles. This threshold is
compared to the probable range of volcanic activity over glacial cycles. Our
model is composed of three component models for energy balance, ice sheet
growth and atmospheric CO2. The model is driven by insolation alone, with other
components varying according to a system of coupled, differential equations.
The model replicates modern climate conditions and seasonality, CO2-doubling
experiments, and - when forced with ice core CO2 - the late-Pleistocene sea
level record. We obtain a switch from 40 ka to ~100 ka cycles as the mid-ocean
ridge CO2 response to glacial cycles is increased. These ~100 ka cycles are
phase-locked to obliquity, lasting 80 or 120 ka. The mid-ocean ridge response
required is, at best, just within a 95% confidence interval of MOR CO2
emissions.

measured drifting behavior from different profile components in PSR J1840-0840
for the first time with the leading component showing drifting with 13.5(0.7)
periods while the weak trailing component showed drifting of around 18(1)
periods. Large nulling do hamper accuracy of these quantities derived using
standard Fourier techniques. A more accurate comparison was drawn from
driftband slopes, measured after sub-pulse modeling. These measurements
revealed interesting sporadic and irregular drifting behavior in both pulsars.
We conclude that the previously reported different drifting periodicities in
the trailing component of PSR J1741-0840 is likely due to the spread in these
driftband slopes. We also find that both components of PSR J1840-0840 show
similar driftband slopes within the uncertainties. Unique nulling-drifting
interaction is identified in PSR J1840-0840 where, in most occasions, the
pulsar tends to start nulling after what appears to be an end of a driftband.
Similarly, when the pulsar switches back to an emission phase, in most
occasions it starts at the beginning of a new driftband in both components.
Such behaviors have not been detected in any other pulsars to our knowledge. We
also found that PSR J1741-0840 seems to have no memory of its previous burst

after longer nulls for both components. We discuss possible explanations for
these intriguing nulling-drifting interactions seen in both pulsars based on

introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative
adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative
adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization
schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is
formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that
sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the
individuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the
private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we
investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the
binary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models,
we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that
the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion)
match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can
be easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics.

tens of thousands of genetic variants among a variety of traits/diseases,
shedding a light on the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Polygenicity
of complex diseases, which refers to the phenomenon that a vast number of risk
variants collectively contribute to the heritability of complex diseases with
modest individual effects, have been widely accepted. This imposes a major
challenge towards fully characterizing the genetic bases of complex diseases.
An immediate implication of polygenicity is that a much larger sample size is
required to detect risk variants with weak/moderate effects. Meanwhile,
accumulating evidence suggests that different complex diseases can share
genetic risk variants, a phenomenon known as pleiotropy. In this study, we
propose a statistical framework for Leveraging Pleiotropic effects in
large-scale GWAS data (LPG). LPG utilizes a variational Bayesian
expectation-maximization (VBEM) algorithm, making it computationally efficient

LPG over existing methods that do not leverage pleiotropy, we conducted
extensive simulation studies and also applied LPG to analyze three au- toimmune

results indicate that LPG can improve the power of prioritization of risk

Electron. Imaging, 25(2), 2016] that one can
perform fast non-local means (NLM) denoising of one-dimensional signals using a
method called lifting. The cost of lifting is independent of the patch length,
which dramatically reduces the run-time for large patches. Unfortunately, it is
difficult to directly extend lifting for non-local means denoising of images.
To bypass this, the authors proposed a separable approximation in which the
image rows and columns are filtered using lifting. The overall algorithm is
significantly faster than NLM, and the results are comparable in terms of PSNR.
However, the separable processing often produces vertical and horizontal
stripes in the image. This problem was previously addressed by using a
bilateral filter-based post-smoothing, which was effective in removing some of
the stripes. In this letter, we demonstrate that stripes can be mitigated in
the first place simply by involving the neighboring rows (or columns) in the
filtering. In other words, we use a two-dimensional search (similar to NLM),
while still using one-dimensional patches (as in the previous proposal). The
novelty is in the observation that one can use lifting for performing
two-dimensional searches. The proposed approach produces artifact-free images,
whose quality and PSNR are comparable to NLM, while being significantly faster.

complex systems, and in particular for cities where it describes how various
properties change with population. The empirical study of scaling on a wide
range of urban datasets displays apparent nonlinear behaviors whose statistical
validity and meaning were recently the focus of many debates. We discuss here
another aspect which is the implication of such scaling forms on individual
cities and how they can be used for predicting the behavior of a city when its
population changes. We illustrate this discussion on the case of delay due to
traffic congestion with a dataset for 101 US cities in the range 1982-2014. We
show that the scaling form obtained by agglomerating all the available data for
different cities and for different years displays indeed a nonlinear behavior,
but which appears to be unrelated to the dynamics of individual cities when
their population grow. In other words, the congestion induced delay in a given
city does not depend on its population only, but also on its previous history.
This strong path-dependency prohibits the existence of a simple scaling form
valid for all cities and shows that we cannot always agglomerate the data for
many different systems. More generally, these results also challenge the use of
transversal data for understanding longitudinal series for cities.

The measurement uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of
8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of up to 20.2 fb$^{-1}$. The differential cross sections
are measured for each jet flavour with respect to the transverse energy of the
leading photon in two photon pseudorapidity regions: $|\eta^\gamma|<1.37$ and
$1.56<|\eta^\gamma|<2.37$. The measurement covers photon transverse energies
$25 < E_\textrm{T}^\gamma<400$ GeV and $25 < E_\textrm{T}^\gamma<350$ GeV
respectively for the two $|\eta^\gamma|$ regions. For each jet flavour, the
ratio of the cross sections in the two $|\eta^\gamma|$ regions is also
measured. The measurement is corrected for detector effects and compared to
leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, based on
various treatments and assumptions about the heavy-flavour content of the
proton. Overall, the predictions agree well with the measurement, but some
deviations are observed at high photon transverse energies. The total
uncertainty in the measurement ranges between 13% and 66%, while the central

of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)
with periodic grating barrier. Through the Patterson function approach, the
theory can handle easily the influence of the lattice distortion of the barrier
on the tunneling process of the electrons. The lattice distortion of the
barrier is sensible to the temperature and can be quite easily weakened by the
thermal relaxation of the strain, and thus the tunneling process of the
electrons gets changed highly with the variation of the temperature of the
system. That is just the physical mechanism for the temperature dependence of
the TMR. From it, we find that the decrease of TMR with rising temperature is
mostly carried by a change in the antiparallel resistance ($R_{AP}$), and the
parallel resistance ($R_{P}$) changes so little that it seems roughly constant,
if compared to the $R_{AP}$, and that, for the annealed MTJ, the $R_{AP}$ is
significantly more sensitive to the strain than the $R_{P}$, and for
non-annealed MTJ, both the $R_{P}$ and $R_{AP}$ are not sensitive to the
strain. They are both in agreement with the experiments of the MgO-based MTJs.
Other relevant properties are also discussed.

for their significant interfacial properties in electrochemical and electronic
devices. To ascertain the interface effects, we investigate dynamical and
structural properties of two ILs in nanoscale confinement at various
temperatures. Specifically, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
for ILs composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations and hexafluorophosphate
([Bmim][PF6]) or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between
amorphous silica slabs. Density profiles of the ionic species across the slit
reveal that [PF6] and [BF4] anions tend to stay closer to the slab wall than
[Bmim] cations resulting in a bi-layered arrangement in the interfacial region.
For the cations, we observe a preferred orientation at the surface with the
methyl groups pointing towards the wall and the butyl tails projected inwards.
Mean square displacements and incoherent scattering function reveal slowed and
heterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore. In particular,
spatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase
by about two orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces, an
effect to be considered when designing applications. The altered structural and
dynamical features of the confined ILs can be related to an existence of
preferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces. Detailed
analyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and surface
properties show that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular
arrangements of silanol groups enable multiple hydrogen bonds with the various
fluorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important trapping mechanism at
the silica surface.

technique against adversaries. This paper studies the schedule strategies of

spectra itself reflects the degree of local disorder via the width of the

the fluctuations at the $Sb$ - site. The fluctuations originate either from
conduction electrons or from magnetic moments. In contrast to the semi metal
$FeSb_2$ with a clear signature of the charge and spin gap formation in
$1/T_1(T)T ( \sim exp/ (\Delta k_BT) ) $, the 1\% $Te$ doped system exhibits
almost metallic conductivity and a almost filled gap. A weak divergence of the
SLRR coefficient $1/T_1(T)T \sim T^{-n} \sim T^{-0.2}$ points towards the
presence of electronic correlations towards low temperatures wheras the
\textit{5\%} $Te$ doped sample exhibits a much larger divergence in the SLRR
coefficient showing $1/T_1(T)T \sim T^{-0.72} $. According to the specific heat
divergence a power law with $n\ =\ 2\ m\ =\ 0.56$ is expected for the SLRR.

  the Massive MIMO Rate Limit",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal BeamFormers (BFs) that maximize the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) for a
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) interference broadcast channel (IBC)
remains an important research area. Under practical scenarios, the problem is
compounded by the fact that only partial channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) is available. Hence, a typical choice of the optimization
metric is the Expected Weighted Sum Rate (EWSR). However, the presence of the
expectation operator makes the optimization a daunting task. On the other hand,
for the particular, but significant, special case of massive MIMO (MaMIMO), the
EWSR converges to Expected Signal covariance Expected Interference covariance
based WSR (ESEI-WSR) and this metric is more amenable to optimization.
Recently, [1] considered a multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO)
scenario and proposed approximating the EWSR by ESEI-WSR. They then derived a
constant bound for this approximation. This paper performs a refined analysis
of the gap between EWSR and ESEI-WSR criteria for finite antenna dimensions.

investigate the possibility of detecting SLSNe-I using ESA's Euclid satellite,
scheduled for launch in 2020. In particular, we study the Euclid Deep Survey
(EDS) which will provide a unique combination of area, depth and cadence over
the mission. We estimated the redshift distribution of Euclid SLSNe-I using the
latest information on their rates and spectral energy distribution, as well as
known Euclid instrument and survey parameters, including the cadence and depth
of the EDS. We also applied a standardization method to the peak magnitudes to
create a simulated Hubble diagram to explore possible cosmological constraints.
We show that Euclid should detect approximately 140 high-quality SLSNe-I to z ~
3.5 over the first five years of the mission (with an additional 70 if we lower
our photometric classification criteria). This sample could revolutionize the
study of SLSNe-I at z>1 and open up their use as probes of star-formation
rates, galaxy populations, the interstellar and intergalactic medium. In
addition, a sample of such SLSNe-I could improve constraints on a
time-dependent dark energy equation-of-state, namely w(a), when combined with
local SLSNe-I and the expected SN Ia sample from the Dark Energy Survey. We
show that Euclid will observe hundreds of SLSNe-I for free. These luminous
transients will be in the Euclid data-stream and we should prepare now to
identify them as they offer a new probe of the high-redshift Universe for both

in the study of causal inference. However, this assumption may be violated in
many settings, and in recent years has been relaxed considerably. Often this
has been achieved with either the aid of a known underlying network, or the
assumption that the population can be partitioned into separate groups, between
which there is no interference, and within which each subject's outcome may be
affected by all the other subjects in the group via the proportion exposed (the
stratified interference assumption). In this paper, we instead consider a
complete interference setting, in which each subject affects every other
subject's outcome. In particular, we make the stratified interference
assumption for a single group consisting of the entire sample. This can occur
when the exposure is a shared resource whose efficacy is modified by the number
of subjects among whom it is shared. We show that a targeted maximum likelihood

gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star merger, was observed by
many powerful telescopes from radio to $\gamma$-ray waveband. The weak nuclear
activities of NGC 4993 suggest that it is a low-luminosity active galactic
nuclear (LLAGN). We build the multi-waveband spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of NGC 4993 from literatures. We find that the radio spectrum at $\sim
100-300$ GHz is much steeper than that of low-frequency waveband (e.g., 6-100
GHz), where this break was also found in the supermassive black holes in our
galaxy center (Sgr A*), and in some other nearby AGNs. The radio emission above
and below this break may has different physical origins, which provide an
opportunity to probe the accretion and jet properties. We model the
multi-waveband SEDs of NGC 4993 with an advection-dominated accretion flow
(ADAF)-jet model. We find that the high-frequency steep radio emission at
millimeter waveband is consistent with the prediction of the ADAF, while the
low-frequency flat radio spectrum is better fitted by the jet. Further more,
the X-ray emission can be also explained by the ADAF model simultaneously. From
the model fits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine (e.g.,
accretion rate near the horizon of the black hole and mass-loss rate in jet)
for NGC 4993. This result strengthen that the millimiter, submillimer and deep
X-ray observations are crucial to understand the weak or quiescent activities
in supermassive black-hole systems. Further simultaneous millimeter and X-ray
monitoring of this kind of LLAGNs will help us to better understand the
physical origin of multiwaveband emission.

sampling over 40 h. Short-term stability measurements show an out-of-loop
timing jitter of only 1.3 fs RMS integrated from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. To validate the
network performance, we present a comprehensive noise analysis based on the
feedback flow between the setup elements. Our analysis identifies nine
uncorrelated noise sources, out of which the slave laser's inherent jitter
dominates with 1.26 fs RMS. This suggests that the timing precision of the
network is not limited by the synchronization technique, and so could be much
further improved by developing lasers with lower inherent noise.

This new approach works well on distributed datasets and deals with data

first phase executes a clustering algorithm on local data, assuming that the
datasets was already distributed among the system processing nodes. The second
phase deals with the local clusters aggregation to generate global clusters.
This approach not only generates local clusters on each processing node in
parallel, but also facilitates the formation of global clusters without prior
knowledge of the number of the clusters, which many partitioning clustering
algorithm require. In this study, this approach was applied on spatial
datasets. The proposed aggregation phase is very efficient and does not involve
the exchange of large amounts of data between the processing nodes. The
experimental results show that the approach has super linear speed up, scales
up very well, and can take advantage of the recent programming models, such as
MapReduce model, as its results are not affected by the types of

complex media has been desired for long yet considered challenging. One
feasible strategy is through optical wavefront engineering, where the optical
scattering-induced phase distortions are time reversed or pre-compensated so
that photons travel along different optical paths interfere constructively at
the targeted position within a scattering medium. To define the targeted
position, an internal guidestar is needed to guide or provide a feedback for
wavefront engineering. It could be injected or embedded probes such as
fluorescence or nonlinear microspheres, ultrasonic modulation, as well as
absorption perturbation. Here we propose to use a magnetically controlled
optical absorbing microsphere as the internal guidestar. Using a digital
optical phase conjugation system, we obtained sharp optical focusing within
scattering media through time-reversing the scattered light perturbed by the
magnetic microshpere. Since the object is magnetically controlled, dynamic
optical focusing is allowed with a relatively large field-of-view by scanning
the magnetic field externally. Moreover, the magnetic microsphere can be
packaged with an organic membrane, using biological or chemical means to serve
as a carrier. Therefore the technique may find particular applications for
enhanced targeted drug delivery, and imaging and photoablation of angiogenic
vessels in tumours.

technologically, this process is unattainable in ambient environment, because
graphene quickly oxidises at high temperatures. Here, we take the performance
of graphene-based incandescent devices to the next level by encapsulating
graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Remarkably, we found that the hBN
encapsulation provides an excellent protection for hot graphene filaments even
at temperatures well above 2000 K. Unrivalled oxidation resistance of hBN
combined with atomically clean graphene/hBN interface allows for a stable light
emission from our devices in atmosphere for many hours of continuous operation.
Furthermore, when confined in a simple photonic cavity, the thermal emission
spectrum is modified by a cavity mode, shifting the emission to the visible
range spectrum. We believe our results demonstrate that hBN/graphene

important high-temperature regime and to pave the way for future optoelectronic

presently known improved positivity bounds provided they are weakly coupled. We
discuss the form of the EFT Lagrangian for a weakly coupled UV completion of
massive gravity which closely parallels the massive Galileon, and perform the
power counting of corrections to the scattering amplitude and the positivity
bounds. The Vainshtein mechanism which is central to the phenomenological
viability of massive gravity is entirely consistent with weak coupling since it
is classical in nature. We highlight that the only implication of the improved

establish the main processes prevalent in the gas at the foot points of the
giant molecular loops (GMLs) in the Galactic center region
  Methods: Using the 22-m Mopra telescope, we mapped the M$-3.8+0.9$ molecular
cloud, placed at the foot points of a giant molecular loop, in 3-mm range
molecular lines. To derive the molecular hydrogen column density, we also
observed the $^{13}$CO $(2-1)$ line at 1 mm using the 12-m APEX telescope. From
the 3 mm observations 12 molecular species were detected, namely HCO$^+$, HCN,
H$^{13}$CN, HNC, SiO, CS, CH$_3$OH, N$_2$H$^+$, SO, HNCO, OCS, and HC$_3$N.
  Results: Maps revealing the morphology and kinematics of the M$-3.8+0.9$
molecular cloud in different molecules are presented. We identified six main
molecular complexes. We derive fractional abundances in 11 selected positions
of the different molecules assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium.
  Conclusions: Most of the fractional abundances derived for the M$-3.8+0.9$
molecular cloud are very similar over the whole cloud. However, the fractional
abundances of some molecules show significant difference with respect to those
measured in the central molecular zone (CMZ). The abundances of the shock
tracer SiO are very similar between the GMLs and the CMZ. The methanol emission
is the most abundant specie in the GMLs. This indicates that the gas is likely
affected by moderate $\sim $ 30 km s$^{-1}$ or even high velocity (50 km
s$^{-1}$) shocks, consistent with the line profile observed toward one of the
studied position. The origin of the shocks is likely related to the flow of the
gas throughout the GMLs towards the foot points.

Furthermore, under a suitable mapping between the parameters describing the

that the dynamical transport properties strongly depend on magnetic

However, similar as for CH 3 CN, current photochemical models fail to reproduce
this CN reservoir. We also found that the abundance peak of NaCN appears at a
radius of 3 x 10 15 cm, approximately where the abundance of NaCl, suggested to
be the parent species, starts to decay. However, the abundance ratio shows that
the NaCl abundance is lower than that obtained for NaCN. We expect that the LTE
assumption might result in NaCN abundances higher than the real ones. Updated
photochemical models, collisional rates, and reaction rates are essential to
determine the possible paths of the NaCN formation.

and advocated for verifying the memory-safety property of computer programs. At
present, one of its biggest challenges is to effectively prove entailments
containing inductive heap predicates. These entailments are usually proof
obligations generated when verifying programs that manipulate complex data
structures like linked lists, trees, or graphs.
  To assist in proving such entailments, this paper introduces a lemma
synthesis framework, which automatically discovers lemmas to serve as eureka
steps in the proofs. Mathematical induction and template-based constraint
solving are two pillars of our framework. To derive the supporting lemmas for a
given entailment, the framework firstly identifies possible lemma templates
from the entailment's heap structure. It then sets up unknown relations among
each template's variables and conducts structural induction proof to generate
constraints about these relations. Finally, it solves the constraints to find
out actual definitions of the unknown relations, thus discovers the lemmas. We
have integrated this framework into a prototype prover and have experimented it
on various entailment benchmarks. The experimental results show that our
lemma-synthesis-assisted prover can prove many entailments that could not be
handled by existing techniques. This new proposal opens up more opportunities
to automatically reason with complex inductive heap predicates.

designed for application in distributed and cloud storage systems. Similar to
classical block codes, there is an important bound called the Singleton-type
bound for locally repairable codes. In this paper, an optimal locally
repairable code refers to a block code achieving this Singleton-type bound.
Like classical MDS codes, optimal locally repairable codes carry some very nice
combinatorial structures. Since introduction of the Singleton-type bound for
locally repairable codes, people have put tremendous effort on constructions of
optimal locally repairable codes. Due to hardness of this problem, there are
few constructions of optimal locally repairable codes in literature. Most of
these constructions are realized via either combinatorial or algebraic
structures.
  In this paper, we employ automorphism groups of rational function fields to
construct optimal locally repairable codes by considering the group action on
the projective lines over finite fields. It turns out that we are able to
construct optimal locally repairable codes with reflexibility of locality as
well as smaller alphabet size comparable to the code length. In particular, we
produce new families of $q$-ary locally repairable codes, including codes of
length $q+1$ via cyclic groups and codes via dihedral groups.

strong shear. We provide numerical results in support of a conjecture that
irrespective of the linear stability of the origin, there is a critical
strength of the shear at which the system dynamics loses synchronisation and
enters phase (III).

In our approach, an embedding PDE is formulated in the embedding space using

enables the use of standard Cartesian numerics for general manifolds that are
open or closed, with or without orientation, and of any codimension. An
algorithm is presented for the important example of harmonic maps and
generalized to a broader class of PDEs, which includes $p$-harmonic maps.
Improved efficiency and robustness are observed in convergence studies relative

learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to
fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of
complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. The basic idea
of the proposed PDE-Net is to learn differential operators by learning
convolution kernels (filters), and apply neural networks or other machine
learning methods to approximate the unknown nonlinear responses. Comparing with
existing approaches, which either assume the form of the nonlinear response is
known or fix certain finite difference approximations of differential
operators, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential
operators and the nonlinear responses. A special feature of the proposed
PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to
easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive
and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by
fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and
the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from
wavelet theory). We also discuss relations of the PDE-Net with some existing
networks in computer vision such as Network-In-Network (NIN) and Residual
Neural Network (ResNet). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the
potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the
dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.

pixels through a segmentation process. However, imaging artifacts such as the
partial volume effect and sensor noise complicate the classification process.
These effects increase the pixel intensity variance of each constituent class,
causing intensities from one class to overlap with another. This increased
variance makes threshold based segmentation methods insufficient due to
ambiguous overlap regions in the pixel intensity distributions. The class
ambiguity becomes even more complex for systems with more than two
constituents, such as unsaturated moist granular media. In this paper, we
propose an image processing workflow that improves segmentation accuracy for
multiphase systems. First, the ambiguous transition regions between classes are
identified and removed, which allows for global thresholding of single-class
regions. Then the transition regions are classified using a distance function,
and finally both segmentations are combined into one classified image. This
workflow includes three methodologies for identifying transition pixels and we
demonstrate on a variety of synthetic images that these approaches are able to
accurately separate the ambiguous transition pixels from the single-class
regions. For situations with typical amounts of image noise, misclassification
errors and area differences calculated between each class of the synthetic
images and the resultant segmented images range from 0.69-1.48% and 0.01-0.74%,
respectively, showing the segmentation accuracy of this approach. We
demonstrate that we are able to accurately segment x-ray microtomography images

NP-complete.
  We consider the polytopes of these problems and their 1-skeletons. We prove
that in both cases it is a NP-complete problem to determine whether the
vertices of 1-skeleton are adjacent. Although it is possible to obtain a
superpolynomial lower bounds on the clique numbers of these graphs. These
values characterize the time complexity in a broad class of algorithms based on
linear comparisons. The results indicate a fundamental difference in
combinatorial and geometric properties between the considered problems and the

Nevertheless, driven systems occur in a much wider context than this, leaving

unbounded from above. We couple these energy levels resonantly through a
periodic drive, and discuss the heating dynamics of this system as a function

action in the partition function via discretized Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary
terms. We define several ways to represent a causal set using overlapping
subsets, which then allows us to distinguish between null and non-null bounding
hypersurfaces in an embedding space. We discuss algorithms to differentiate
between different types of regions, consider when these distinctions are
possible, and then apply the algorithms to several spacetime regions. Numerical
results indicate the volumes of timelike boundaries can be measured to within
$0.5\%$ accuracy for flat boundaries and within $10\%$ accuracy for highly
curved boundaries for medium-sized causal sets with $N=2^{14}$ spacetime

the hardcore interaction in pure-1D real space becomes a confinement quark-like

spectroscopic, photometric and polarimetric variability for several decades. In
this paper, we set out to verify if a simplified analytical model in which
Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) threading an otherwise spherical wind is
able to reproduce the many broadband continuum light curves from the literature
with a reasonable set of parameters.
  We modified the optically thin model we developed in Ignace, St-Louis &
Proulx-Giraldeau (2015) to approximately account for multiple scattering and
used it to fit 13 separate datasets of this star. By including two CIRs in the
wind, we obtained reasonable fits for all datasets with coherent values for the
inclination of the rotation axis ($i_0=166^{\circ}$) and for its orientation in
the plane of the sky, although in the latter case we obtained two equally
acceptable values ($\psi=63^{\circ}$ and $\psi=152^{\circ}$) from the
polarimetry.
  Additional line profile variation simulations using the Sobolev approximation
for the line transfer allowed us to eliminate the $\psi=152^{\circ}$ solution.
With the adopted configuration ($i_0=166^{\circ}$ and $\psi=63^{\circ}$), we
were able to reproduce all datasets relatively well with two CIRs located near
the stellar equator and always separated by $\sim 90^{\circ}$ in longitude. The
epoch-dependency comes from the fact that these CIRs migrate along the surface
of the star. Density contrasts smaller than a factor of two and large opening
angles for the CIR ($\beta \geq 35^{\circ}$) were found to best reproduce the
type of spectroscopic variability reported in the literature.

emerging quantum technologies. The valley pseudospin in transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers is a promising degree of freedom for such
control, with the optical Stark effect allowing for valley-selective
manipulation of energy levels in WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ using ultrafast optical
pulses. Despite these advances, understanding of valley-sensitive optical Stark
shifts in TMDCs has been limited by reflectance-based detection methods where
the signal is small and prone to background effects. More sensitive
polarization-based spectroscopy is required to better probe ultrafast Stark
shifts for all-optical manipulation of valley energy levels. Here, we show
time-resolved Kerr rotation to be a more sensitive probe of the
valley-selective optical Stark effect in monolayer TMDCs. Compared to the
established time-resolved reflectance methods, Kerr rotation is less sensitive
to background effects. Kerr rotation provides a five-fold improvement in the
signal-to-noise ratio of the Stark effect optical signal and a more precise
estimate of the energy shift. This increased sensitivity allows for observation
of an optical Stark shift in monolayer MoS$_2$ that exhibits both valley- and
energy-selectivity, demonstrating the promise of this method for investigating
this effect in other layered materials and heterostructures.

transition frequency changes in response to the quantum vacuum fluctuations of

replacing the TLS by a harmonic oscillator, normal mode splitting leads to a
quantitatively similar shift, without taking quantum fluctuations into account.
In a weakly-anharmonic system, lying in between the harmonic oscillator and a
TLS, the origins of such shifts can be unclear. An example of this is the
dispersive shift of a transmon qubit in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED).
Although often referred to as a Lamb shift, the dispersive shift observed in
spectroscopy in circuit QED could contain a significant contribution from
normal-mode splitting that is not driven by quantum fluctuations, raising the
question: how much of this shift is quantum in origin? Here, we treat
normal-mode splitting separately from shifts induced by quantum vacuum
fluctuations in the Hamiltonian of a weakly-anharmonic system, providing a
framework for understanding the extent to which observed frequency shifts can
be attributed to quantum fluctuations.

continuum intensities with advective cosmic-ray transport, evolving the
cosmic-ray electron population and magnetic field strength in the tails as
functions of distance to the nucleus. We find that if there is no in-situ
particle acceleration in the tails, then decelerating flows are required that
depend on radius $r$ as $v\propto r^{\beta}$ ($\beta\approx -1$). This then
compensates for the strong adiabatic losses due to the lateral expansion of the
tails. We are able to find self-consistent solutions in agreement with the
entrainment model of Croston & Hardcastle, where the magnetic field provides
$\approx$$1/3$ of the pressure needed for equilibrium with the surrounding
intra-cluster medium (ICM). We obtain an advective time-scale of $\approx$$190$
Myr, which, if equated to the source age, would require an average expansion
Mach number ${\cal M} \approx 5$ over the source lifetime. Dynamical arguments
suggest that instead, either the outer tail material does not represent the
oldest jet plasma or else the particle ages are underestimated due to the
effects of particle acceleration on large scales.

is not at disposal in this context, the proposed extension is compatible with
perturbation theory. In the second part of the paper we analyze the adiabatic
limits of these states showing that also the density of relative entropy

communicate simultaneously to two legitimate receivers while ensuring that the
communication is not detected by an adversary, the warden. The legitimate
receivers and the adversary observe the transmission from the transmitter via a
three-user discrete or Gaussian memoryless broadcast channel. We focus on the
case where the ""no-input"" symbol is not redundant, i.e., the output
distribution at the warden induced by the no-input symbol is not a mixture of
the output distributions induced by other input symbols, so that the covert
communication is governed by the square root law, i.e., at most
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ bits can be transmitted over $n$ channel uses. We show that
for such a setting, a simple time-division strategy achieves the optimal
throughputs for a non-trivial class of broadcast channels; this is not true for
communicating over broadcast channels without the covert communication
constraint. Our result implies that a code that uses two separate optimal
point-to-point codes each designed for the constituent channels and each used
for a fraction of the time is optimal in the sense that it achieves the best
constants of the $\sqrt{n}$-scaling for the throughputs. Our proof strategy
combines several elements in the network information theory literature,
including concave envelope representations of the capacity regions of broadcast

device for measuring the three spatial coordinates of the particles passing

the Huygens-Fresnel principle occurs from several neighboring wavefronts

An angular factor plausibly accounts for the decrease in intensity at large
diffraction angles, unlike the obliquity factors of the wave optics theories.
The position measurement modifies the polarization states and for an incident
photon in an elliptically polarized pure state, the ellipse axes can undergo a
rotation which depends on the diffraction angles.

highly discriminative imaging features is an open problem. In this paper, our

present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order to evaluate the
quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons are performed in
discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules. This experimental
set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated nodules,
which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining highly
discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational
purposes, and (3) generate realistic samples to train deep networks with big

variety of applications in science and engineering. In many applications,
stable equilibrium or periodic behavior is critical to a well functioning
system. Sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibrium points or
periodic orbits of certain deterministic dynamical systems with delayed
dynamics are known and it is of interest to understand the sample path behavior
of such systems under the addition of small noise. We consider a small noise
stochastic delay differential equation (SDDE) with coefficients that depend on
the history of the process over a finite delay interval. We obtain asymptotic
estimates, as the noise vanishes, on the time it takes a solution of the
stochastic equation to exit a bounded domain that is attracted to a stable
equilibrium point or periodic orbit of the corresponding deterministic
equation. To obtain these asymptotics, we prove a sample path large deviation
principle (LDP) for the SDDE that is uniform over initial conditions in bounded

construction in a particular case (Abel integral equation). After that, we
propose our method in a general case, showing that it does work when dealing

successfully explained by approaches based on initial state momentum space

if such a scaling is also an inherent feature of the approaches that employ
strong final state interaction in p+p collisions. We find that hydrodynamical

the existence of degeneracies on their compositions. Here we present a model of

that the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star
allows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely
constrain the planet's composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of
the mass-radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet's

of two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently

new frequency bands to support new services that require higher data rates,
which in turn needs broader bandwidths. To meet this requirement, extremely
high frequency (EHF), particularly Q (36 to 46 GHz) and V (46 to 56 GHz) bands,
is the best viable solution because of its complete availability. The most
serious challenge the EHF band poses is the attenuation caused by rain. This
paper investigates the effect of the rain on Q and V bands' performances in
Bangladeshi climatic conditions. The rain attenuations of the two bands are
predicted for the four main regions of Bangladesh using ITU rain attenuation
model. The measured rain statistics is used for this prediction. It is observed
that the attenuation due to rain in the Q/V band reaches up to 150 dB which is
much higher than that of the currently used Ka band. The variability of the
rain attenuation is also investigated over different sessions of Bangladesh.
The attenuation varies from 40 dB to 170 dB depending on the months. Finally,
the amount of rain fade required to compensate the high rain attenuation is
also predicted for different elevation angles.

widely studied over the last decade and consist of three equidistant low
frequencies with a central frequency several times more intense than its two

corresponding small Fermi-surface pockets. Furthermore the ARPES data indicate
only four Fermi-arcs with bilayer splitting, and show no sign of such small
areas in the Fermi surface. Here we argue that the magnetic oscillations
measured in under-doped bilayer high temperature superconductors, in particular
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta }$, provide a measure of the interplanar
electronic coupling rather than the areas of fine-grain reconstruction of the
Fermi surfaces coming from induced charge density waves. This identification is
based on the relative intensities of the different peaks, as well as their
angular dependence, which points to an effective Fermi surface that is larger
than the oscillation frequencies, and is compatible with several indications
from ARPES. The dominance of such frequencies with respect to the fundamental
frequencies from the Fermi surface is natural for a strongly correlated
quasi-two dimensional electronic systems where non-linear mixings of
frequencies are more resistant to sample inhomogeneity.

recognition, machine learning, and cloud computation such as the Bing search
engine used by Microsoft. This is due to FPGAs great parallel computation
capacity as well as low power consumption compared to general purpose
processors. However, these applications mainly focus on large scale FPGA
clusters which have an extreme processing power for executing massive matrix or
convolution operations but are unsuitable for portable or mobile applications.
This paper describes research on single-FPGA platform to explore the
applications of FPGAs in these fields. In this project, we design a Deep
Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) Language Model (LM) and implement a hardware
accelerator with AXI Stream interface on a PYNQ board which is equipped with a
XILINX ZYNQ SOC XC7Z020 1CLG400C. The PYNQ has not only abundant programmable
logic resources but also a flexible embedded operation system, which makes it
suitable to be applied in the natural language processing field. We design the
DRNN language model with Python and Theano, train the model on a CPU platform,
and deploy the model on a PYNQ board to validate the model with Jupyter
notebook. Meanwhile, we design the hardware accelerator with Overlay, which is
a kind of hardware library on PYNQ, and verify the acceleration effect on the
PYNQ board. Finally, we have found that the DRNN language model can be deployed
on the embedded system smoothly and the Overlay accelerator with AXI Stream
interface performs at 20 GOPS processing throughput, which constitutes a 70.5X
and 2.75X speed up compared to the work in Ref.30 and Ref.31 respectively.

  This papers deals with partial differential equations of second order,
linear, with constant and not constant coefficients, in two variables, which
admit real characteristics. I face the study of PDEs with the mentality of the
applied physicist, but with a weakness for formalization: look inside the black
box of the formulas, try to compact them (for example, proceeding from an
inverse transformation of coordinates) and make them smart (in the context,
reformulating the theory by means of differential operators and related
invariants), applying them with awareness and then connecting them to geometry
or to spatial categories, which are in mathematics what is closest to the
sensible reality. Finally, proposing examples that are exercise and
corroborating for theory.

quantum) produce the accelerated de Sitter expansion at the start and at the
end of the cosmological evolution of the Universe. In these periods, the
Universe contains no matter fields but contains classical and quantum metric
fluctuations, i.e., it is filled with classical and quantum gravitational
waves. In such evolution of the Universe, dominated by gravitational waves, the
de Sitter state is the exact solution to the self-consistent equations for
classical and quantum gravitational waves and background geometry for the empty
space-time with FLRW metric. In both classical and quantum cases, this solution
is of the instanton origin since it is obtained in the Euclidean space of
imaginary time with the subsequent analytic continuation to real time. The
cosmological acceleration from gravitational waves provides a transparent
physical explanation to the coincidence, threshold and 'old cosmological
constant' paradoxes of dark energy avoiding recourse to the anthropic
principle. The cosmological acceleration from virtual gravitons at the start of
the Universe evolution produces inflation, which is consistent with the
observational data on CMB anisotropy. Section 1 is devoted to cosmological
acceleration from classical gravitational waves. Section 2 is devoted to the
theory of virtual gravitons in the Universe. Section 3 is devoted to
cosmological acceleration from virtual gravitons. Section 4 discusses the
consistency of the theory with observational data on dark energy and inflation.
The discussion of mechanism of acceleration and cosmological scenario are
contained in Sections 5 and 6. Appendix contains the theory of stochastic
nonlinear gravitational waves of arbitrary wavelength and amplitude in an
isotropic Universe.

arithmetic cir- cuits, i.e., perform additions and multiplications on encrypted
data, without having the decryp- tion key. One of the most efficient class of
FHE schemes include BGV and FV schemes, which are based on the hardness of the
RLWE problem. They share some common features: ciphertext sizes grow after each
homomorphic multiplication; multiplication is much more costly than addition,
and the cost of homomorphic multiplication scales linearly with the input
ciphertext sizes. Furthermore, there is a special relinearization operation
that reduce the size of a ciphertext, and the cost of relinearization is on the
same order of magnitude as homomorpic multiplication. This motivates us to
define a discrete optimization problem, which is to decide where (and how much)
in a given circuit to relinearize, in order to minimize the total computational
cost. In this paper, we formally define the relinearize problem. We prove that
the problem is NP-hard. In addition, in the special case where each vertex has
at most one outgoing edge, we give a polynomial-time algorithm.

Sometimes unbelievable confusion in the literature is summarized by von
Neumann's sentence: ""No one knows what entropy really is."" Four major questions
stand before thermodynamics. (1) How many kinds of entropy are there? (2) What
is the physical meaning of entropy? (3) Is entropy a subjective or an objective
property? (4) Is entropy in any way related to information? This paper attempts
to describe the roots, the conceptual history of this important concept and to
describe the path of its development and application in different scientific
disciplines. Through this we attempt to give some possible answers to the

the Extended COST-231 Hata model could be applied for effective planning of the

Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet, of Bangladesh are selected for prediction of

badly affected region by the scintillation fade depth (SFD), which is followed
by Chittagong and the SFD is minimum in Dhaka and Sylhet. The difference in
SFDs among the considered cities does not vary heavily. It is also found that
the SFD varies from 3 dB to 13 dB depending on the frequency in used. Moreover,
higher scintillation is found in rainy season of Bangladesh. During this
period, the scintillation becomes double of the average figure.

roughness. By the use of the Kirchhoff approximation a closed form mathematical
expression for the angular dependence of the mean differential reflection
coefficient is derived under the assumption that the surface is illuminated by
a plane incident wave. It is shown that this quantity can be expressed in terms
of the isotropic, bivariate ($\alpha$-stable) L\'evy distribution of a
stability parameter that is two times the Hurst exponent of the underlying
surface. Features of the expression for the mean differential reflection
coefficient are discussed, and its predictions compare favorably over large
regions of parameter space to results obtained from rigorous computer
simulations based on equations of scattering theory. It is demonstrated how the
Hurst exponent and the topothesy of the self-affine surface can be inferred
from scattering data it produces. Finally several possible scattering
configurations are discussed that allow for an efficient extraction of these
