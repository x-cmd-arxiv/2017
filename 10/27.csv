liquids due to liquid-surface interactions. Some examples are significant
changes in diffusion properties and the temperature at which the liquid-solid
phase transition takes place. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations suggest
that thin layers of water on a diamond surface may remain solid even well above
room temperature. However, because of the small volumes that are involved, it
is exceedingly difficult to examine these phenomena experimentally with current
technologies. In this context, shallow NV centers promise a highly sensitive
tool for the investigation of magnetic signals emanating from liquids and
solids that are deposited on the surface of a diamond. Moreover, NV centers are
non-invasive sensors with extraordinary performance even at room-temperature.
To that end, we present here a theoretical work, complemented with numerical
evidence based on bosonization techniques, that predicts the measurable signal
from a single NV center when interacting with large spin baths in different
configurations. We therefore propose single NV centers as sensors capable to
resolve structural water features at the nanoscale and even sensitive to phase
transitions.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system

our proposed approach, we use minimum and maximum intensity projections to ease
the annotation variations among different slices and type of MRIs. Then, we
present a CNN to obtain deep feature representation corresponding to each MRI
modality (T1-weighted and T2-weighted). At the final step, we employ canonical
correlation analysis (CCA) to perform a fusion operation at the feature level,
leading to discriminative canonical correlation features. Extracted features
are used for classification. Our results indicate significant improvements over
other potential approaches to solve this important problem. The proposed
approach doesn't require explicit sample balancing in cases of imbalance
between positive and negative examples. To the best of our knowledge, our study
is the first to automatically diagnose IPMN using multi-modal MRI.

single-output (MISO) downlink that provides the receivers with prespecified
levels of quality-of-service (QoS) can be quite challenging when the channel
state information is not perfectly known at the base station. The constraint of
having the SINR meet or exceed a given threshold with high probability is
intractable in general, which results in problems that are fundamentally hard
to solve. In this paper, we will develop a high quality approximation of the
SINR outage constraint that, along with a semidefinite relaxation, enables us
to formulate the beamformer design problem as a convex optimization problem
that can be efficiently solved. For systems in which the uncertainty size is
small, a further approximation yields algorithms based on iterative evaluations
of closed-form expressions that have substantially lower computational cost.
Since finding the beamforming directions incurs most of the computational load
of these algorithms, analogous power loading algorithms for predefined
beamforming directions are developed and their performance is shown to be close
to optimal. When the system contains a large number of antennas, the proposed
power loading can be obtained at a computational cost that grows only linearly
in the number of antennas. The proposed power loading algorithm provides an
explicit relationship between the outage probability required and the power
consumed, which allows us to precisely control the power consumption, and
automatically identifies users who are consuming most of the power resources.
The flexibility of the proposed approach is illustrated by developing a power
loading technique that minimizes an average notion of outage.

Independently of this work, a deterministic $O(n\log^2\log n)$ time
construction was just put on arXiv by Cheng, Li, and Wu. We also give a

long-distance synchronization strings that allow for local and very fast
decoding. In particular, only $O(\log^3 n)$ time and access to logarithmically
many symbols is required to decode any index.
  We give several applications for these results:
  $\bullet$ For any $\delta<1$ and $\epsilon>0$ we provide an insdel correcting
code with rate $1-\delta-\epsilon$ which can correct any $O(\delta)$ fraction
of insdel errors in $O(n\log^3n)$ time. This near linear computational
efficiency is surprising given that we do not even know how to compute the

show that such codes can not only efficiently recover from $\delta$ fraction of
insdel errors but, similar to [Schulman, Zuckerman; TransInf'99], also from any
$O(\delta/\log n)$ fraction of block transpositions and replications.

infinite channel simulations with exponentially smaller memory and decoding

vanishing issue in the skipgram model without a proper negative sampler. By
performing an insightful analysis from the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
learning perspective, we demonstrate that, both theoretically and intuitively,
negative samples with larger inner product scores are more informative than
those with lower scores for the SGD learner in terms of both convergence rate
and accuracy. Understanding this, we propose an alternative sampling algorithm
that dynamically selects informative negative samples during each SGD update.
More importantly, the proposed sampler accounts for multi-dimensional
self-embedded features during the sampling process, which essentially makes it
more effective than the original popularity-based (one-dimensional) sampler.
Empirical experiments further verify our observations, and show that our
fine-grained samplers gain significant improvement over the existing ones

rapidly and becomes comparable to system size as $V$ increases towards a

metamaterial system containing defects to an incident acoustic plane wave at
normal or oblique incidence. The transmission response is composed of
pass-bands with oscillatory behaviour, separated by band gaps and covers a wide
frequency range. The presence of gain and loss in the layers leads to the
emergence of symmetry breaking and re-entrant phases. In the general case, a
system containing defects will display a more general property,
pseudo-Hermiticity (PH), of which $\mathcal{PT}$ systems are a subset. In the
PH-symmetric phase, unidirectional responses of the reflection, accomplished by
reversing the parity $\mathcal{P}$, can be found but the response sometimes
deviates from the predictions of simple scattering theory which call for a
pseudo-unitarity relation relating the transmission and the two directions of
reflections to hold. The converse of reversing the parity, reversing the time
operator $\mathcal{T}$ in a spatially-asymmetric system within the PH-symmetric
regime can lead to different transmissions: a pass-band versus a stop-band. As
regions of stable PH-symmetric pass-band transmission oscillations occur over a
wide spectral range, there is a large flexibility in system parameters such as
layer thicknesses, for leading to the desired unidirectional traits. In
addition, we find that while defects in general lead to a near or complete loss
of PH symmetry at all frequencies, they can be exploited to produce
highly-sensitive responses, making such systems good candidates for sensor
applications.

could be easily constrained. For the case of massive gravity, we show
analytically how the B modes are sourced in a manner differing from the
massless case leading to a plateau at low $l$ in the CMB spectrum. We also
study the case when there are more than one graviton, and when pressure
instabilities are present. The latter would occur in doubly coupled bigravity
in the radiation era. We focus on the case where a massless graviton becomes
tachyonic in the radiation era whilst a massive one remains stable. As the
unstable mode decouples from matter in the radiation era, we find that the
effects of the instability is largely reduced on the spectrum of B-modes as
long as the unstable graviton does not grow into the non-linear regime. In all
cases when both massless and massive gravitons are present, we find that the
B-mode CMB spectrum is characterised by a low $l$ plateau together with a
shifted position for the first few peaks compared to a purely massive graviton

Connected Discrete Closed Manifolds (II)}, we discussed two algorithms for
deforming and contracting a simply connected discrete closed manifold into a
discrete sphere. The first algorithm was a continuation of work that began in
{\it Algorithms for Deforming and Contracting Simply Connected Discrete Closed
Manifolds (I)}, the second algorithm contained a more direct treatment of
contraction for discrete manifolds. In this paper, we clarify that we can use
this same method on standard piecewise linear (PL) complexes on the
triangulation of general smooth manifolds. Our discussion is based on
triangulation techniques invented by Cairns, Whitehead, and Whitney more than
half of a century ago. In this paper, we use PL or simplicial complexes to
replace certain concepts of discrete manifolds in previous papers. Note that
some details in the original papers related to discrete manifolds may also need
to be slightly modified for this purpose. In this paper, we use the algorithmic
procedure (a contraction process) to prove the following theorem: For a finite
triangulation of a simply-connected closed and orientable 3-manifold $M$ in
Euclidean space, if a (simply-connected closed) 2-cycle which was made by
2-cells of this triangulation separates $M$ into two connected components, then
each of the components will also be simply-connected. In addition, we can
algorithmically make $M$ to be homeomorphic to a 3-sphere. The relationship of
the theorem to a generalized Jordan separation problem, the general
Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, and other important problems are also discussed.
This revision adds more figures and explanations as well as two more special
cases. We will post the detailed algorithm/procedure for practical
triangulations in the following papers.

of the method which combines the Asynchronous Time-based Image Sensor with

These spike are processed by a spiking neural network running on TrueNorth with
a 1 millisecond resolution to accurately determine the order and time
difference of spikes from neighboring pixels, and therefore infer the velocity.
The spiking neural network is a variant of the Barlow Levick method for optical
flow estimation. The system is evaluated on two recordings for which ground

estimated power budget of under 80mW for the sensor and computation.

measured by out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs), has lately
received considerable attention. Recently, a hydrodynamical description of
OTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are
conjectured to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without
randomness. Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved
quantities (e.g., energy). We do this by considering local random unitary
circuits with a conserved U$(1)$ charge and argue, with numerical and
analytical evidence, that the presence of a conservation law slows relaxation
in both time ordered {\textit{and}} out-of-time-ordered correlation functions,
both can have a diffusively relaxing component or ""hydrodynamic tail"" at late
times. We verify the presence of such tails also in a deterministic,
peridocially driven system. We show that for OTOCs, the combination of
diffusive and ballistic components leads to a wave front with a specific,
asymmetric shape, decaying as a power law behind the front. These results also
explain existing numerical investigations in non-noisy ergodic systems with
energy conservation. Moreover, we consider OTOCs in Gibbs states, parametrized
by a chemical potential $\mu$, and apply perturbative arguments to show that
for $\mu\gg 1$ the ballistic front of information-spreading can only develop at
times exponentially large in $\mu$ -- with the information traveling
diffusively at earlier times. We also develop a new formalism for describing
OTOCs and operator spreading, which allows us to interpret the saturation of
OTOCs as a form of thermalization on the Hilbert space of operators.

smoothness and exponential decay was imposed along the hypersurfaces of the
multidimensional impulse responses, allowing lower variance estimates than

also be expressed in a frequency domain context, however there are several
competing representations which all possess some unique advantages. Perhaps the
most natural representation is the generalized frequency response function

meaningful in a geometric sense, but also they are extremely useful as many
problems can be attacked by first reducing to the local case and taking
advantage of their nice properties. Any localization of a ring $R$, for
instance, is flat over $R$. Similarly, when studying finitely generated modules
over local rings, projectivity, flatness, and freeness are all equivalent.
  We introduce the packages PruneComplex, Localization and LocalRings for
Macaulay2. The first package consists of methods for pruning chain complexes
over polynomial rings and their localization at prime ideals. The second
package contains the implementation of such local rings. Lastly, the third
package implements various computations for local rings, including syzygies,
minimal free resolutions, length, minimal generators and presentation, and the
Hilbert--Samuel function.
  The main tools and procedures in this paper involve homological methods. In
particular, many results depend on computing the minimal free resolution of

modeling of incompressible two-phase flows with high density ratio and using
meshes of arbitrary topology. The variational finite element technique relies
on the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation for capturing the phase interface on a
fixed mesh with a mass conservative and energy-stable discretization. Mass is
conserved by enforcing a Lagrange multiplier which has both temporal and
spatial dependence on the solution of the phase-field equation. The spatial
part of the Lagrange multiplier is written as a mid-point approximation to make
the scheme energy-stable. This enables us to form a conservative, energy-stable
and positivity preserving scheme. The proposed variational technique reduces
spurious and unphysical oscillations in the solution while maintaining
second-order spatial accuracy. To model a generic two-phase free-surface flow,
we couple the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation with the Navier-Stokes equations.
Comparison of results between standard linear stabilized finite element method
and the present variational formulation shows a remarkable reduction of
oscillations in the solution while retaining the boundedness of the
phase-indicator field. We perform a standalone test to verify the accuracy and
stability of the Allen-Cahn two-phase solver. Standard two-phase flow
benchmarks such as Laplace-Young law and sloshing tank problem are carried out
to assess the convergence and accuracy of the coupled Navier-Stokes and
Allen-Cahn solver. Two- and three-dimensional dam break problem are then solved
to assess the scheme for the problem with topological changes of the air-water
interface on unstructured meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the phase-field
solver for a practical problem of wave-structure interaction in offshore
engineering using general three-dimensional unstructured meshes.

systems in the presence of a locally conserved quantity like charge or energy
that moves diffusively. The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling
sheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is
reversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative
process. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is
constrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading
operator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight
of the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is
described by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a
source that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This
emission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the
dissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local
conserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion
current. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a
butterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially
non-observable, thereby acting as the ""reservoir"" that facilitates the
dissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a
power law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of
the conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator
(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival
of the ballistic front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws,
it develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only
as a power of time instead of exponentially. We also derive these results
within an effective hydrodynamic description which contains multiple coupled
diffusion equations.

According to theory, coiled magnetic fields close to the black hole accelerate

understanding jet formation physics. But this is challenging because emission

a brightening radio jet. The origin of these sub-second optical variations has
hitherto been controversial. Not only does our work strongly support a jet
origin for the optical variations, it also sets a characteristic elevation of
<~10$^3$ Schwarzschild radii for the main inner optical emission zone above the
black hole, constraining both internal shock and magnetohydrodynamic models.
Similarities with blazars suggest that jet structure and launching physics
could potentially be unified under mass-invariant models. Two of the
best-studied jetted black hole binaries show very similar optical lags, so this
size scale may be a defining feature of such systems.

preparation of ground states of gapless models with Lorentz invariance.
Assuming the system initially resides in the ground state of a corresponding
massive model, we show that a superluminally-moving `front' that
$\textit{locally}$ quenches the mass, leaves behind it (in space) a state
$\textit{arbitrarily close}$ to the ground state of the gapless model.
Importantly, our protocol takes time $\mathcal{O} \left( L \right)$ to produce
the ground state of a system of size $\sim L^d$ ($d$ spatial dimensions), while
a fully adiabatic protocol requires time $\sim \mathcal{O} \left( L^2 \right)$
to produce a state with exponential accuracy in $L$. The physics of the
dynamical problem can be understood in terms of relativistic rarefaction of
excitations generated by the mass front. We provide proof-of-concept by solving
the proposed quench exactly for a system of free bosons in arbitrary
dimensions, and for free fermions in $d = 1$. We discuss the role of
interactions and UV effects on the free-theory idealization, before numerically
illustrating the usefulness of the approach via simulations on the quantum
Heisenberg spin-chain.

Testing predictions for individual satellite galaxies at large distances

predictions, in particular for a statistical sample of satellites since proper
motion predictions exist for almost all of them. This will clarify how
rotationally supported the VPOS is. In addition, Gaia will discover Galactic

further show a single-layer network does not correctly classify the phases of

reasoning about the behavior of concurrent transactions by ensuring they are
isolated from each other while they execute. However, enforcing serializable
isolation comes at a steep cost in performance and hence database systems in
practice support, and often encourage, developers to implement transactions
using weaker alternatives. Unfortunately, the semantics of weak isolation is
poorly understood, and usually explained only informally in terms of low-level
implementation artifacts. Consequently, verifying high-level correctness
properties in such environments remains a challenging problem.
  To address this issue, we present a novel program logic that enables
compositional reasoning about the behavior of concurrently executing
weakly-isolated transactions. Recognizing that the proof burden necessary to
use this logic may dissuade application developers, we also describe an
inference procedure based on this foundation that ascertains the weakest
isolation level that still guarantees the safety of high-level consistency
invariants associated with such transactions. The key to effective inference is
the observation that weakly-isolated transactions can be viewed as functional
(monadic) computations over an abstract database state, allowing us to treat
their operations as state transformers over the database. This interpretation
enables automated verification using off-the-shelf SMT solvers. Case studies
and experiments of real-world applications (written in an embedded DSL in

age of the Galaxy. We chemically dissect the Milky Way disk population using a
sample of red giant stars spanning out to 2~kpc in the solar annulus observed

Our results reveal a clear difference in age between the low- and high-$\alpha$

[$\alpha$/Fe] for the high-$\alpha$ disk stars. Our results indicate that this

properties of young $\alpha$-rich stars are consistent with the rest of the
high-$\alpha$ population and different from the low-$\alpha$ stars of similar

positive feedback (jet-induced star formation). APEX revealed strong CO
emission in star-forming regions but also in regions with no detected tracers
of star formation. When observed, star formation appears to be inefficient
compared to the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.
  We used ALMA to map the 12CO(1-0) emission all along the filaments at 1.3""~
23.8 pc resolution. The CO emission is clumpy and distributed in two main
structures: (i) the Horseshoe complex, outside the HI cloud, where gas is
mostly excited by shocks and no star formation is observed; (ii) the Vertical
filament, at the edge of the HI shell, which is a region of moderate star
formation.
  We identified 140 molecular clouds. A statistical study reveals that they
have very similar physical properties that in the inner Milky Way. However, the
range of radius available with the present observations does not enable to
investigate whether the clouds follow the Larson relation or not. The large
virial parameter of the clouds suggests that gravity is not dominant.
  Finally, the total energy injection in the filaments is of the same order as
in the inner part of the Milky Way. The strong CO emission detected in the
filaments is an indication that the energy injected by the jet acts positively
in the formation of dense molecular gas. The relatively high virial parameter
of the molecular clouds suggests that the injected kinetic energy is too strong
for star formation to be efficient. This is particularly the case in the
Horseshoe complex where the virial parameter is the largest and where strong CO
is detected with no associated star formation. This is the first evidence of

it is a zeta-regularized version of the `trace' of the Laplacian. An analogous
hide-and-seek game may be played on Markov chains, where the spectral invariant
that emerges is a classical quantity known as Kemeny's constant. We develop the
analogies between the two settings in order to highlight the connections
between the regularized trace and Kemeny's constant. Our proof relies on the
connections between Green's functions and expected hitting times, and the fact
that the regularized trace may be approached via the Green's function.

generalized to metric spaces of negative type. In this paper, we consider a

propose kernel k-groups, which is an extension of Hartigan's method to kernel

computational cost as kernel k-means (which is based on Lloyd's heuristic) but
our numerical results show an improved performance, especially in higher

so far requires big demonstration datasets in the real world or big sets
consisting of a large variety of realistic and closely related 3D CAD models.
These real or virtual data should, moreover, have very similar characteristics
to the conditions expected at test time. These stringent requirements and the
time consuming data collection processes that they entail, are currently the
most important impediment that keeps deep reinforcement learning from being
deployed in real-world applications. Therefore, in this work we advocate an
alternative approach, where instead of avoiding any domain shift by carefully
selecting the training data, the goal is to learn a policy that can cope with
it. To this end, we propose the DoShiCo challenge: to train a model in very
basic synthetic environments, far from realistic, in a way that it can be
applied in more realistic environments as well as take the control decisions on
real-world data. In particular, we focus on the task of collision avoidance for
drones. We created a set of simulated environments that can be used as
benchmark and implemented a baseline method, exploiting depth prediction as an
auxiliary task to help overcome the domain shift. Even though the policy is
trained in very basic environments, it can learn to fly without collisions in a
very different realistic simulated environment. Of course several benchmarks
for reinforcement learning already exist - but they never include a large
domain shift. On the other hand, several benchmarks in computer vision focus on
the domain shift, but they take the form of a static datasets instead of
simulated environments. In this work we claim that it is crucial to take the
two challenges together in one benchmark.

just below the 100-mb tropopause and a lower clouds at ~1.9 bars. Latitudinal
variations in aerosols are interpreted in context of notional circulation

significant reduction in aerosol scattering optical thickness in southern

control approaches, which support compliant interactions between human and

provisions for the human to modify the robot's current trajectory---the human
cannot affect the robot's future desired trajectory through pHRI. In this
paper, we present an algorithm for physically interactive trajectory
deformations which, when combined with impedance control, allows the human to
modulate both the actual and desired trajectories of the robot. Unlike related
works, our method explicitly deforms the future desired trajectory based on
forces applied during pHRI, but does not require constant human guidance. We
present our approach and verify that this method is compatible with traditional
impedance control. Next, we use constrained optimization to derive the
deformation shape. Finally, we describe an algorithm for real time

Experimental results demonstrate reduction in the human's effort and
improvement in the movement quality when compared to pHRI with impedance

we identify ""Pop III-bright"" galaxies as those with at least 75% of their flux
coming from Pop III stars. While less than 1% of galaxies brighter than $m_{\rm
UV, AB} = 31.4$ mag are Pop III--bright in the range $7\leq z \leq8$, roughly
17% of such galaxies are Pop III--bright at $z=9$, immediately before
reionization occurs in our simulation. Moving to $z=10$, $m_{\rm UV, AB} =
31.4$ mag corresponds to larger, more luminous galaxies and the Pop III-bright
fraction falls off to 5%. Finally, at the highest redshifts, a large fraction
(29% at $z=14$ and 41% at $z=15)$ of all galaxies are Pop III-bright regardless
of magnitude. While $m_{\rm UV, AB} = 31.4$ mag galaxies are extremely rare
during this epoch, we find that 13% of galaxies at $z = 14$ are Pop III-bright
with $m_{\rm UV, AB} \le 33$ mag, an intrisic magnitude within reach of the
James Webb Space Telescope using lensing. Thus, we predict that the best
redshift to search for luminous Pop III--bright galaxies is just before
reionization, while lensing surveys for fainter galaxies should push to the
highest redshifts possible.

Algorithms (SSA) allow us to simulate the dynamic behavior of complex kinetic

realistic size problems. We present a pilot service, named WebStoch, developed
in the context of our StochSoCs research project, allowing life scientists with
no high-performance computing expertise to perform over the internet stochastic
simulations of large-scale biological network models described in the SBML
standard format. Biomodels submitted to the service are parsed automatically
and then placed for parallel execution on distributed worker nodes. The workers
are implemented using multi-core and many-core processors, or FPGA accelerators
that can handle the simulation of thousands of stochastic repetitions of
complex biomodels, with possibly thousands of reactions and interacting
species. Using benchmark LCSE biomodels, whose workload can be scaled on
demand, we demonstrate linear speedup and more than two orders of magnitude
higher throughput than existing serial simulators.

measured to an accuracy of a few percent within the standard $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm, its median density is not known even to order of magnitude. Typical
points lie in low-density regions and are not part of a collapsed structure of
any scale. Locally, the dark matter distribution is then simply a stretched
version of that in the early universe. In this single-stream regime, the
distribution of unsmoothed density is sensitive to the initial power spectrum
on all scales, in particular on very small scales, and hence to the nature of
the dark matter. It cannot be estimated reliably using conventional
cosmological simulations because of the enormous dynamic range involved, but a
suitable excursion set procedure can be used instead. For the Planck
cosmological parameters, a 100 GeV WIMP, corresponding to a free-streaming mass
$\sim 10^{-6}M_\odot$, results in a median density of $\sim 4\times 10^{-3}$ in
units of the mean density, whereas a 10 $\mu$eV axion with free-streaming mass
$\sim 10^{-12}M_\odot$ gives $\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$, and Warm Dark Matter with
a (thermal relic) mass of 1 keV gives $\sim 8\times 10^{-2}$. In CDM (but not
in WDM) universes, single-stream regions are predicted to be topologically
isolated by the excursion set formalism. A test by direct N-Body simulations
seems to confirm this prediction, although it is still subject to finite size
and resolution effects. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any of these
properties is observable and so suitable for constraining the properties of
dark matter.

inference for missing data. First, we present a Bayesian feature allocation
model for tumor subclone reconstruction using mutation pairs. The key
innovation lies in the use of short reads mapped to pairs of proximal single
nucleotide variants (SNVs). In contrast, most existing methods use only
marginal reads for unpaired SNVs. In the same context of using mutation pairs,
in order to recover the phylogenetic relationship of subclones, we then develop
a Bayesian treed feature allocation model. In contrast to commonly used feature
allocation models, we allow the latent features to be dependent, using a tree
structure to introduce dependence. Finally, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian
approach to monotone missing data in longitudinal studies with non-ignorable
missingness. In contrast to most existing methods, our method allows for
incorporating information from auxiliary covariates and is able to capture
complex structures among the response, missingness and auxiliary covariates.
Our models are validated through simulation studies and are applied to
real-world biomedical datasets.

the edges of the multigraph burn at speed 1. If the fire reaches a vertex of
degree 2, the fire gets directly passed on to the neighbouring edge; a vertex
of degree at least 3, however, passes the fire either to all of its neighbours
or none, each with probability $1/2$. If the fire goes out before the whole
network is burnt, we again set fire to a uniform point. We are interested in
the number of fires which must be set in order to burn the whole network, and
the number of points which are burnt from two different directions. We analyse
these quantities for a random multigraph having $n$ vertices of degree 3 and

Hubble parameter ($H_0$). One remaining systematic is a bias from the
additional mass due to a galaxy group at the lens redshift or along the
sightline. We quantify this bias for more than 20 strong lenses that have
well-sampled sightline mass distributions, focusing on the convergence $\kappa$
and shear $\gamma$. In 23% of these fields, a lens group contributes a $\ge$1%
convergence bias; in 57%, there is a similarly significant line-of-sight group.
For the nine time delay lens systems, $H_0$ is overestimated by 11$^{+3}_{-2}$%
on average when groups are ignored. In 67% of fields with total $\kappa \ge$
0.01, line-of-sight groups contribute $\gtrsim 2\times$ more convergence than
do lens groups, indicating that the lens group is not the only important mass.
Lens environment affects the ratio of four (quad) to two (double) image
systems; all seven quads have lens groups while only three of 10 doubles do,
and the highest convergences due to lens groups are in quads. We calibrate the
$\gamma$-$\kappa$ relation: $\log(\kappa_{\rm{tot}}) = (1.94 \pm 0.34)
\log(\gamma_{\rm{tot}}) + (1.31 \pm 0.49)$ with a rms scatter of 0.34 dex.
Shear, which, unlike convergence, can be measured directly from lensed images,
can be a poor predictor of $\kappa$; for 19% of our fields, $\kappa$ is
$\gtrsim 2\gamma$. Thus, accurate cosmology using strong gravitational lenses

so-called excess mass maps to predictions provided by a recent semi-analytic
model, which is implanted within the dark-matter Millennium Simulation. We
analyse galaxies with stellar masses between $10^9-10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ in
two photometric redshift bins, for lens redshifts $z\lesssim0.6$, focusing on
pairs inside groups and clusters. To allow us a better interpretation of the
maps, we discuss the impact of chance pairs, i.e., galaxy pairs that appear
close to each other in projection only. Our tests with synthetic data
demonstrate that the patterns observed in the maps are essentially produced by
correlated pairs that are close in redshift ($\Delta z\lesssim5\times10^{-3}$).
We also verify the excellent accuracy of the map estimators. In an application
to the galaxy samples in the CFHTLenS, we obtain a $3\sigma-6\sigma$
significant detection of the excess mass and an overall good agreement with the
galaxy model predictions. There are, however, a few localised spots in the maps
where the observational data disagrees with the model predictions on a
$\approx3.5\sigma$ confidence level. Although we have no strong indications for
systematic errors in the maps, this disagreement may be related to the residual
B-mode pattern observed in the average of all maps. Alternatively, misaligned
galaxy pairs inside dark matter halos or lensing by a misaligned distribution
of the intra-cluster gas might also cause the unanticipated bulge in the
distribution of the excess mass between lens pairs.

the London penetration length. We show that, by contrast, the magnetic
properties of anisotropic multi-band London models are not this simple, and the
anisotropy leads to the inter-band phase differences becoming coupled to the
magnetic field. This results in the magnetic field in such systems having N+1
penetration lengths, where N is the number of field components or bands. That
is, in a given direction, the magnetic field decay is described by N+1 modes
with different amplitudes and different decay length scales. For certain
anisotropies we obtain magnetic modes with complex masses. That means that
magnetic field decay is not described by a monotonic exponential increment set
by a real penetration length but instead is oscillating. Some of the
penetration lengths are shown to diverge away from the superconducting phase
transition when the mass of the phase-difference mode vanishes. Finally the
anisotropy-driven hybridization of the London mode with the Leggett modes can
provide an effectively non-local magnetic response in the nominally local
London model. Focusing on the two-component model, we discuss the magnetic
field inversion that results from the effective non-locality, both near the

innermost blazar regions, not accessible to our current instruments. Aims. The
primary objective of the work is to associate the observed hard X-ray
variability properties in the blazars to their flux and spectral states,
thereby, based on the correlation among them, extract the details about the
emission regions and the processes occurring near the central engine. Methods.
We carried out timing, spectral and cross-correlation analysis of 31 NuSTAR
observations of 13 blazars. We investigated the spectral shapes of the sources
using single power-law, broken power-law and log-parabola models. We also
studies the co-relation between the soft and the hard emission using
z-transformed discrete correlation function. Results. We found that for most of
the sources the hard X-ray emission can be well represented by log-parabola
model; and that the spectral slopes for different blazar sub-classes are
consistent with so called blazar sequence. We noted a close connection between
the flux and spectral slope within the source sub-class in the sense that high
flux and/or flux states tend to be harder in spectra. In BL Lacertae objects,
assuming particle acceleration by diffusive shocks and synchrotron cooling as
the dominant processes governing the observed flux variability, we constrain
the magnetic field of the emission region to be a few gauss; whereas in
flat-spectrum radio quasars, using external Compton models, we estimate the

developed approach is a combination of the method of De Giorgi iteration and
the technique of Lyapunov functionals by adequately splitting the original
problem into two subsystems. The ISS in $L^\infty$-norm for a 1-$D$ transport
equation and the ISS in $L^2$-norm for Burgers' equation have been established
using this method. As an application of the main result for the 1-D transport
equation, a study on ISS properties in $L^\infty$-norm of a 1-D transport
equation with anti-stable term under boundary feedback control is carried out.
This is the first time that the method of De Giorgi iteration is introduced in
the ISS theory for infinite dimensional systems, and the developed method can
be generalized for tackling some problems on multidimensional spatial domains
and be applied to a wider class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs.

where transactions and data are not under the control of any third party

a verifiable and permanent way. Based on blockchain technology, we propose a
global higher education credit platform, named EduCTX. This platform is based
on the concept of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).
It constitutes a globally trusted, decentralized higher education credit and
grading system that can offer a globally unified viewpoint for students and
higher education institutions (HEIs), as well as for other potential
stakeholders such as companies, institutions, and organizations. As a proof of
concept, we present a prototype implementation of the environment, based on the
open-source Ark Blockchain Platform. Based on a globally distributed
peer-to-peer network, EduCTX will process, manage and control ECTX tokens,
which represent credits that students gain for completed courses such as ECTS.
HEIs are the peers of the blockchain network. The platform is a first step
towards a more transparent and technologically advanced form of higher
education systems. The EduCTX platform represents the basis of the EduCTX
initiative which anticipates that various HEIs would join forces in order to
create a globally efficient, simplified and ubiquitous environment in order to
avoid language and administrative barriers. Therefore we invite and encourage
HEIs to join the EduCTX initiative and the EduCTX blockchain network.

spectrum or a realistic post-shock accretion column (PSAC) source irradiates a
cool and spherical WD. The PSAC source emits thermal spectra of various
temperatures stratified along the column according to the PSAC model. In the
point source simulation, we confirm (1) a source harder and nearer to the WD
enhances the reflection, (2) higher iron abundance enhances the equivalent
widths (EWs) of fluorescent iron K${\alpha}_{1,2}$ lines and their Compton
shoulder, and increases cut-off energy of a Compton hump, and (3) significant
reflection appears from an area that is more than 90 deg apart from the
position right under the point X-ray source because of the WD curvature. The
PSAC simulation reveals that (1) a more massive WD basically enhances the
intensities of the fluorescent iron K${\alpha}_{1,2}$ lines and the Compton
hump, except for some specific accretion rate, because the more massive WD
makes the hotter PSAC from which higher energy X-rays are preferentially
emitted, (2) a larger specific accretion rate monotonically enhances the
reflection because it makes the hotter and shorter PSAC, and (3) the intrinsic
thermal component hardens by occultation of the cool base of the PSAC by the
WD. We quantitatively evaluate influences of the parameters on the EWs and the
Compton hump with both types of sources. We also calculate X-ray modulation
profiles brought about by the WD spin. They depend on angles of the spin axis
from the line of sight and from the PSAC, and whether the two PSACs can be
seen. The reflection spectral model and the modulation model involve the
fluorescent lines and the Compton hump and can directly be compared to the data

potassium-doped two-dimensional anisotropic black phosphorus (BP) with
semi-Dirac dispersion. The prototype device is a BP channel clamped between two
contacts maintained at unequal temperatures. The choice of BP lies in the
predicted efficient thermolectric behaviour. A temperature-induced difference
in the Fermi levels of the two contacts drives the current (typified by the
electro-thermal conductance) which we calculate using the Landauer transport
equation. The current shows an initial rise when the device is operated at
lower temperatures. The rise stalls at progressively higher temperatures and
$I_{th}$ acquires a plateau-like flat profile indicating a competing effect
between a larger number of transmission modes and a corresponding drop in the
Fermi level difference between the contacts. The current is computed for both
\textit{n}- and \textit{p}-type BP and the difference thereof is attributed to
the particle-hole asymmetry. The utility of such calculations lie in conversion
of the heat production and an attendant temperature gradient in miniaturized
devices to useful electric power and a possible realization of solid-state
Peltier cooling. Unlike the flow of $I_{th}$ that removes heat, the ability of
a material to maintain a steady temperature is reflected in its heat capacity
which is formulated in this work for BP via a Sommerfeld expansion. In the
concluding part, we draw a microscopic connection between the two seemingly

to the underlying density of states. Finally, a qualitative analysis of a

local connectivity and its evolution in terms of cage-breaking, and
interparticle interactions mediated by the particle chemistry and colloidal

non-trivial fitting parameters: the relaxation time of the cage and the viscous
relaxation time. The interparticle spring constant contains information about
the strength of interparticle bonding which is tuned by the amount of
surfactant that renders the particles hydrophobic and mutually attractive. This

designing the mechanical response of colloidal assemblies at the air-water

together, and on this basis, we loosely constrain the magnetic field strength

the Balmer and He I emission lines transition into absorption features, with He
II developing an absorption core. We use our observations of this phenomenon to
test theoretical models of the accretion curtain and conclude that the H and He
I lines are produced throughout the curtain, in contravention of theoretical
predictions of separate H and He I line-forming regions. Moreover, a
significant amount of He II emission originates within the accretion curtain,

order to interpret the Mueller matrix of a luminescent medium at the emission

polarization transformations at the emission frequency. A general framework for
this kind of analysis is presented herein. The fluorescence Mueller matrix is
expressed as a product of Mueller matrices of the medium at the excitation and
emission frequencies and a scattering matrix, integrated over path length. The
Stokes vector for the incident light, evolving according to the Mueller matrix
of the medium at the excitation frequency, is multiplied by the scattering
matrix to give a Stokes vector of the emitted light along the propagation
direction. The scattering matrix is derived from an incoherent orientation
ensemble average over a phenomenological scattering tensor that embodies
intrinsic molecular scattering proprieties, and dynamical processes that occur
during the excited state. The general framework is evaluated for three
anisotropic materials carrying luminescent dye molecules including the
following: a chiral fluid, a stretched polymer film, and a chiral, biaxial
crystal. In the latter case, the most complex, the Mueller matrix was collected
in conoscopic illumination and the fluorescence Mueller matrix, mapped in

interest for many signal processing applications since the resulting
performance strongly relies on the quality of the matrix estimation. In this
context, $M$-estimators appear as very interesting candidates, mainly due to
their flexibility to the statistical model and their robustness to outliers
and/or missing data. However, the behavior of such estimators still remains
unclear and not well understood since they are described by fixed-point
equations that make their statistical analysis very difficult. To fill this
gap, the main contribution of this work is to prove that these estimators
distribution is more accurately described by a Wishart distribution than by the
classical asymptotical Gaussian approximation. To that end, we propose a new
`Gaussian-core' representation for Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES)
distributions and we analyze the proximity between $M$-estimators and a
Gaussian-based Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM), unobservable in practice and
playing only a theoretical role. To confirm our claims we also provide results
for a widely used function of $M$-estimators, the Mahalanobis distance.

Endothermic singlet fission is desired for maximum energy conversion
efficiency, and such systems have been shown to form an excimer-like state with
multi-excitonic character prior to the appearance of triplets. However, the
role of the excimer as an intermediate has, until now, been unclear. Here we
show, using 5,12-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)tetracene in solution as a
prototypical example, that, rather than acting as an intermediate, the excimer
serves to trap excited states, to the detriment of singlet fission yield. We
clearly demonstrate that singlet fission and its conjugate process,
triplet-triplet annihilation, occur at a longer intermolecular distance than an
excimer intermediate would impute. These results establish that an endothermic
singlet fission material must be designed that avoids excimer formation, thus
allowing singlet fission to reach its full potential in enhancing photovoltaic
energy conversion.

predict a transition from weak to strong coupling regime , with a Rabi
splitting energy exceeding 200 meV for a Si nanoparticle covered by monolayer
WS 2 at the magnetic optical Mie resonance. This large transition is achieved
due to the symmetry of magnetic dipole Mie mode and by changing the surrounding
dielectric material from air to water. The prediction is based on the
experimental estimation of TMDC dipole moment variation obtained from measured
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of WS2 monolayers in different solvents. An
ability of such a system to tune the resonance coupling is realized
experimentally for optically resonant spherical Si nanoparticles placed on a

apRHL with novel proof rules for constructing new approximate couplings. We
give an approximate coupling proof of privacy for the Sparse Vector mechanism,
a well-known algorithm from the privacy literature whose privacy proof is
notoriously subtle, and produce the first formalized proof of privacy for
Sparse Vector in apRHL. Finally, we propose several more sophisticated

board $B$ and with target $H$ is played as follows. Two players alternately
claim edges of $B$. The first player to build a copy of $H$ wins. If none of
the players win, the game is declared a draw. A notorious open question of Beck
asks whether the first player has a winning strategy in $\mathcal{R}(K_n,K_k)$
in bounded time as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Surprisingly, in a recent paper Hefetz
et al. constructed a $5$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ for which they proved
that the first player does not have a winning strategy in
$\mathcal{R}(K_n^{(5)},\mathcal{H})$ in bounded time. They naturally ask
whether the same result holds for graphs. In this paper we make further
progress in decreasing the rank.
  In our first result, we construct a graph $G$ (in fact $G=K_6\setminus K_4$)
and prove that the first player does not have a winning strategy in
$\mathcal{R}(K_n \sqcup K_n,G)$ in bounded time. As an application of this
result we deduce our second result in which we construct a $4$-uniform
hypergraph $G'$ and prove that the first player does not have a winning
strategy in $\mathcal{R}(K_n^{(4)},G')$ in bounded time. This improves the
result in the paper above.
  An equivalent formulation of our first result is that the game
$\mathcal{R}(K_\omega\sqcup K_\omega,G)$ is a draw. Another reason for interest
on the board $K_\omega\sqcup K_\omega$ is a folklore result that the disjoint
union of two finite positional games both of which are first player wins is
also a first player win. An amusing corollary of our first result is that at

  Graphs","ICDM 2017, 10 pages",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The number of triangles in a graph is useful to deduce a plethora of
important features of the network that the graph is modeling. However, finding
the exact value of this number is computationally expensive. Hence, a number of
approximation algorithms based on random sampling of edges, or wedges (adjacent
edge pairs) have been proposed for estimating this value. We argue that for
large sparse graphs with power-law degree distribution, random edge sampling
requires sampling large number of edges before providing enough information for
accurate estimation, and existing wedge sampling methods lead to biased
samplings, which in turn lead to less accurate estimations. In this paper, we
propose a hybrid algorithm between edge and wedge sampling that addresses the
deficiencies of both approaches. We start with uniform edge sampling and then
extend each selected edge to form a wedge that is more informative for
estimating the overall triangle count. The core estimate we make is the number
of triangles each sampled edge in the first phase participates in. This
approach provides accurate approximations with very small sampling ratios,
outperforming the state-of-the-art up to 8 times in sample size while providing
estimations with 95% confidence.

maximize the negative effect of the false information on Kalman filter's

is mathematically characterized. For the adversary, many closed-form results
for the optimal attack strategies that maximize Kalman filter's estimation
error are theoretically derived. It is shown that by choosing the optimal
correlation coefficients among the bias noises and allocating power optimally
among sensors, the adversary could significantly increase Kalman filter's

less understood how NVM can be combined with managed runtime like Java virtual

holistic extension to Java and its runtime, to enable Java programmers to
exploit NVM for persistence management with high performance. Espresso first
provides a general persistent heap design called Persistent Java Heap (PJH) to
manage persistent data as normal Java objects. The heap is then strengthened
with a recoverable mechanism to provide crash consistency for heap metadata. It
then provides a new abstraction called Persistent Java Object (PJO) to provide
an easy-to-use but safe persistent programming model for programmers to persist
application data. The evaluation confirms that Espresso significantly
outperforms state-of-art NVM support for Java (i.e., JPA and PCJ) while being
compatible to existing data structures in Java programs.

models, using flexible Galactic stellar-population priors. The code (called
{\tt StarHorse}) can acommodate different observational datasets, prior
options, partially missing data, and the inclusion of parallax information into
the estimated probabilities. We validate the code using a variety of simulated
stars as well as real stars with parameters determined from asteroseismology,
eclipsing binaries, and isochrone fits to star clusters. Our main goal in this
validation process is to test the applicability of the code to field stars with
known {\it Gaia}-like parallaxes. The typical internal precision (obtained from
realistic simulations of an APOGEE+Gaia-like sample) are $\simeq 8\%$ in
distance, $\simeq 20\%$ in age,$\simeq 6\ %$ in mass, and $\simeq 0.04$ mag in

$\simeq [0,2]\%$ for distances, $\simeq [12,31]\%$ for ages, $\simeq [4,12]\%$
for masses, and $\simeq 0.07$ mag for $A_V$. We provide StarHorse distances and

analysis, with the realization that vectors can be recovered from relatively
very few linear measurements as long as the vectors lie in a low-dimensional
structure, typically the vectors that are zero in most coordinates with respect
to a basis. However, there are many applications where we instead want to
recover vectors that are sparse with respect to a dictionary rather than a
basis. That is, we assume the vectors are linear combinations of at most $s$
columns of a $d \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{D}$, where $s$ is very small relative
to $n$ and the columns of $\mathbf{D}$ form a (typically overcomplete) spanning
set. In this direction, we show that as a matrix $\mathbf{D}$ stays bounded
away from zero in norm on a set $S$ and a provided map ${\boldsymbol \Phi}$
comprised of i.i.d. subgaussian rows has number of measurements at least
proportional to the square of $w(\mathbf{D}S)$, the Gaussian width of the
related set $\mathbf{D}S$, then with high probability the composition
${\boldsymbol \Phi} \mathbf{D}$ also stays bounded away from zero. As a
specific application, we obtain that the null space property of order $s$ is
preserved under such subgaussian maps with high probability. Consequently, we
obtain stable recovery guarantees for dictionary-sparse signals via the
$\ell_1$-synthesis method with only $O(s\log(n/s))$ random measurements and a
minimal condition on $\mathbf{D}$, which complements the compressed sensing
literature.

currently introduces certain systematic errors in the calibrated strain data,
motivating the second stage of the low-latency procedure, known as the

errors. The gstlal calibration pipeline is also used in high latency to

first Spitzer microlensing planet in the Galactic bulge/bar, an assignation
that can be confirmed by two epochs of high-resolution imaging of the combined
source-lens baseline object. The planet's mass M_p= 13.4+-0.9 M_J places it
right at the deuterium burning limit, i.e., the conventional boundary between
""planets"" and ""brown dwarfs"". Its existence raises the question of whether such
objects are really ""planets"" (formed within the disks of their hosts) or
""failed stars"" (low mass objects formed by gas fragmentation). This question
may ultimately be addressed by comparing disk and bulge/bar planets, which is a
goal of the Spitzer microlens program. The host is a G dwarf M_host =
0.89+-0.07 M_sun and the planet has a semi-major axis a~2.0 AU. We use Kepler
K2 Campaign 9 microlensing data to break the lens-mass degeneracy that
generically impacts parallax solutions from Earth-Spitzer observations alone,
which is the first successful application of this approach. The microlensing
data, derived primarily from near-continuous, ultra-dense survey observations
from OGLE, MOA, and three KMTNet telescopes, contain more orbital information
than for any previous microlensing planet, but not quite enough to accurately
specify the full orbit. However, these data do permit the first rigorous test
of microlensing orbital-motion measurements, which are typically derived from
data taken over <1% of an orbital period.

improved fast algorithm for AI based 1-D DCT computation is proposed along with
a single channel 2-D DCT architecture. The design improves on the 4-channel AI

Prototype circuits corresponding to FRS blocks based on two expansion factors
are realized, tested, and verified on FPGA-chip, using a Xilinx Virtex-6
XC6VLX240T device. Post place-and-route results show a 20% reduction in terms
of area compared to the 2-D DCT architecture requiring five 1-D AI cores. The

their numerous applications, such as plastic manufacture and extrusion of
polymer fluids. They are more complex than Newtonian fluids because the
relationship between shear stress and shear rate is nonlinear. One particular
subclass of non-Newtonian fluids is the generalized Oldroyd-B fluid, which is
modelled using terms involving multi-term time fractional diffusion and
reaction. In this paper, we consider the application of the finite difference
method for this class of novel multi-term time fractional viscoelastic
non-Newtonian fluid models. An important contribution of the work is that the
new model not only has a multi-term time derivative, of which the fractional
order indices range from 0 to 2, but also possesses a special time fractional
operator on the spatial derivative that is challenging to approximate. There
appears to be no literature reported on the numerical solution of this type of
equation. We derive two new different finite difference schemes to approximate
the model. Then we establish the stability and convergence analysis of these
schemes based on the discrete $H^1$ norm and prove that their accuracy is of
$O(\tau+h^2)$ and $O(\tau^{\min\{3-\gamma_s,2-\alpha_q,2-\beta\}}+h^2)$,
respectively. Finally, we verify our methods using two numerical examples and
apply the schemes to simulate an unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Couette
flow of a generalized Oldroyd-B fluid model. Our methods are effective and can
be extended to solve other non-Newtonian fluid models such as the generalized
Maxwell fluid model, the generalized second grade fluid model and the
generalized Burgers fluid model.

send the results to a master node where all the computations are aggregated

performance bottleneck that arises is that some of the worker nodes may run

dynamical systems that are often related to a change in the number or stability
of equilibria, bifurcations of boundary value problems are global in nature and
may not be related to any obvious change in dynamical behaviour. Catastrophe
theory is a well-developed framework which studies the bifurcations of critical
points of functions. In this paper we study the bifurcations of solutions of
boundary-value problems for symplectic maps, using the language of
(finite-dimensional) singularity theory. We associate certain such problems
with a geometric picture involving the intersection of Lagrangian submanifolds,
and hence with the critical points of a suitable generating function. Within
this framework, we then study the effect of three special cases: (i) some
common boundary conditions, such as Dirichlet boundary conditions for
second-order systems, restrict the possible types of bifurcations (for example,
in generic planar systems only the A-series beginning with folds and cusps can
occur); (ii) integrable systems, such as planar Hamiltonian systems, can
exhibit a novel periodic pitchfork bifurcation; and (iii) systems with
Hamiltonian symmetries or reversing symmetries can exhibit restricted
bifurcations associated with the symmetry. This approach offers an alternative
to the analysis of critical points in function spaces, typically used in the
study of bifurcation of variational problems, and opens the way to the
detection of more exotic bifurcations than the simple folds and cusps that are

better performance in intra-machine node with hundreds of CPU/MIC cores, and
optimizing the communication among inter-nodes, inter-cores, and between CPUs

  Some benchmark cases from model and/or industrial CFD applications are tested
on the Tianhe-1A and Tianhe-2 supercomputer to evaluate the performance. Among
these CFD cases, the maximum number of grid cells reached 780 billion. The

studied properties of the supported trilayers can be predicted from the lattice
mismatch between the overlayer and the support. Namely, if the strain
dependence of the corresponding quantities for pure strained surfaces is known,
the properties of strained supported trilayers can be reliably estimated. The
obtained results can be used in the design of novel catalysts and predictions

frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) are two commonly adopted modulation
schemes for frequency-selective channels. Compared to SC-FDE, OFDM generally
achieves higher data rate, but at the cost of higher transmit signal
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) that leads to lower power amplifier
efficiency. This paper proposes a new modulation scheme, called flexible
multi-group single-carrier (FMG-SC), which encapsulates both OFDM and SC-FDE as
special cases, thus achieving more flexible rate-PAPR trade-offs between them.
Specifically, a set of frequency subcarriers are flexibly divided into
orthogonal groups based on their channel gains, and SC-FDE is applied over each
of the groups to send different data streams in parallel. We aim to maximize
the achievable sum-rate of all groups by optimizing the subcarrier-group
mapping. We propose two low-complexity subcarrier grouping methods and show via
simulation that they perform very close to the optimal grouping by exhaustive

modulation scheme with optimized subcarrier grouping in improving the rate-PAPR

matrices X_t and L_t, respectively, and then the algorithm suffers a loss given
by the Frobenius inner product of X_t and L_t. The goal of the algorithm is to
minimize the cumulative loss. We can employ a standard framework called Follow
the Regularized Leader (FTRL) for designing algorithms, where we need to choose
an appropriate regularization function to obtain a good performance guarantee.
We show that the log-determinant regularization works better than other popular
regularization functions in the case where the loss matrices L_t are all
sparse. Using this property, we show that our algorithm achieves an optimal
performance guarantee for the online collaborative filtering. The technical
contribution of the paper is to develop a new technique of deriving performance
bounds by exploiting the property of strong convexity of the log-determinant
with respect to the loss matrices, while in the previous analysis the strong
convexity is defined with respect to a norm. Intuitively, skipping the norm
analysis results in the improved bound. Moreover, we apply our method to online
linear optimization over vectors and show that the FTRL with the Burg entropy

rough approximate solutions. On the other extreme, there are exact algorithms
which are exhaustive search in nature and can be costly for practical-sized

complementarity constraints. Then, we develop two novel algorithms: one based
on non-smooth penalty method with a Frank-Wolfe style optimization scheme, the
other based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Both
algorithms solve convex subproblems to efficiently perform the optimization. We
demonstrate the capability of our algorithms to greatly improve a rough initial

realistic input sizes. Further, our approach is naturally applicable to

binary mixture of the hydrogen and the helium ions, along with free electrons.
When, owing to the helium sedimentation, the gradient of the mean molecular
weight (or equivalently, composition or helium ions' concentration) of the
plasma is not negligible, it can have appreciable influence on the stability
criteria of the thermal convective instabilities, e.g., the heat-flux-buoyancy
instability and the magnetothermal instability (MTI). These instabilities are
consequences of the anisotropic heat conduction occurring preferentially along
the magnetic field lines. In this paper, without ignoring the magnetic tension,
we first present the mathematical criterion for the onset of composition
gradient modified MTI. Subsequently, we relax the commonly adopted equilibrium
state in which the plasma is at rest, and assume that the plasma is in a
sheared state which may be due to differential rotation. We discuss how the
concentration gradient affects the coupling between the Kelvin--Helmholtz
instability and the MTI in rendering the plasma unstable or stable. We derive
exact stability criterion by working with the sharp boundary case in which the
physical variables---temperature, mean molecular weight, density, and magnetic
field---change discontinuously from one constant value to another on crossing
the boundary. Finally, we perform the linear stability analysis for the case of
the differentially rotating plasma that is thermally and compositionally
stratified as well. By assuming axisymmetric perturbations, we find the
corresponding dispersion relation and the explicit mathematical expression
determining the onset of the modified MTI.

transition, consistent with the observed spin-1 for the next (even) occupancy.
Our experimental results are interpreted through the use of a Hubbard model
involving two orbitals of the multielectron quantum dot. Allowing for the spin
correlation energy (i.e. including a term favoring Hund's rules) and different
tunnel coupling to different orbitals, we qualitatively reproduce the measured
exchange profiles for all occupancies.

flocking model, raises the question of whether more declarative flocking models
are possible. This question is motivated by the observation that declarative
models are generally simpler and easier to design, understand, and analyze than
operational models. We introduce a very simple control law for flocking based
on a cost function capturing cohesion (agents want to stay together) and
separation (agents do not want to get too close). We refer to it as {\textit
declarative flocking} (DF). We use model-predictive control (MPC) to define
controllers for DF in centralized and distributed settings. A thorough
performance comparison of our declarative flocking with Reynolds' model, and
with more recent flocking models that use MPC with a cost function based on
lattice structures, demonstrate that DF-MPC yields the best cohesion and least
fragmentation, and maintains a surprisingly good level of geometric regularity
while still producing natural flock shapes similar to those produced by
Reynolds' model. We also show that DF-MPC has high resilience to sensor noise.

clearly distinguishable experimental signatures for all superconducting phases.
Both of the time-reversal symmetric phases display a transition to a

include a symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling kinetic energy and show that it

to minimize the empirical risk, that is, the expectation of some loss function

this paper we introduce new regularization techniques using ideas from

the worst-case expected loss, where the worst case is taken over the ball of
all (continuous or discrete) distributions that have a bounded transportation

this ball judiciously, we can guarantee that the worst-case expected loss
provides an upper confidence bound on the loss on test data, thus offering new

to soils for many decades. The Freundlich parameters are often estimated using
unweighted least squares (ULS) analysis after log-log transformation.
Estimating the accuracy of these parameters (characterized by their coefficient
of variation, CV) is an essential element of the use of these parameters.
Accurate CVs can be derived with weighted least squares (WLS), but only if
proper weights are assigned to the residuals in the fitting procedure. This
work presents the derivation of an analytical approximation of these weights
which were found to decrease with increasing concentration, increasing
Freundlich exponent, and increasing CVs of the initial and equilibrium
concentrations. Monte-Carlo simulations for a wide range of Freundlich systems
based on known values of the CVs of the initial and equilibrium concentrations
confirmed the accuracy of this analytical approximation. Unfortunately, in
practice, the CVs of the initial and equilibrium concentrations are unknown a
priori. Simulations showed that the accuracy of the estimated CVs of the
Freundlich parameters was distinctly lower if the CVs of the initial and
equilibrium concentrations were estimated from the isotherm data. However, this
accuracy was still considerably better than when using ULS. It is recommended
to use this analytical approximation whenever these CVs are relevant for the
further use and interpretation of the estimated Freundlich parameters.

distribution system state estimation (DSSE) to monitor the operating conditions
more accurately. Sufficient number of measurements is imperative for a reliable
and accurate state estimation. The limitation on the measurement devices is
generally tackled with using the so-called pseudo measured data. However, the
errors in pseudo data by cur-rent techniques are quite high leading to a poor
DSSE. As customer loads in distribution networks show high cross-correlation in
various locations and over successive time steps, it is plausible that
deploying the spatial-temporal dependencies can improve the pseudo data
accuracy and estimation. Although, the role of spatial dependency in DSSE has
been addressed in the literature, one can hardly find an efficient DSSE
framework capable of incorporating temporal dependencies present in customer
loads. Consequently, to obtain a more efficient and accurate state estimation,
we propose a new non-iterative DSSE framework to involve spatial-temporal
dependencies together. The spatial-temporal dependencies are modeled by
conditional multivariate complex Gaussian distributions and are studied for
both static and real-time state estimations, where information at preceding
time steps are employed to increase the accuracy of DSSE. The efficiency of the
proposed approach is verified based on quality and accuracy indices, standard
deviation and computational time. Two balanced medium voltage (MV) and one
unbalanced low voltage (LV) distribution case studies are used for evaluations.

However, not all of what are considered couplings in literature, even Markovian
couplings, can be turned into sticky couplings, as proved by Rosenthal through
a counter example. Rosenthal then proposed a strengthening of the Markovian
coupling notion, termed as faithful coupling, from which a sticky coupling can
indeed be obtained. We identify the reason why a sticky coupling could not be

type of coupling which can obviously be turned into a sticky coupling. We show

beyond the enumeration problem per se tied to the permutation group, forcing us

802.15.4e TSCH (WSN) where designed with different goals in mind and both play
important roles for respective applications. However, they cause mutual
interference and degraded performance while operating in the same space. To
improve this situation we propose an approach to enable a cooperative control
which type of network is transmitting at given time, frequency and place.
  We recognize that TSCH based sensor network is expected to occupy only small
share of time, and that the nodes are by design tightly synchronized. We
develop mechanism enabling over-the-air synchronization of the Wi-Fi network to
the TSCH based sensor network. Finally, we show that Wi-Fi network can avoid
transmitting in the ""collision periods"". We provide full design and show
prototype implementation based on the Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices.
Our solution does not require changes in any of the standards.

designed by translating a convolutional kernel over all pixels, thus enforcing
translation equivariance. In the case of general graphs however, translation is
not a well-defined operation, which makes shifting a convolutional kernel not
straightforward. In this article, we introduce a methodology to allow the
design of convolutional layers that are adapted to signals evolving on
irregular topologies, even in the absence of a natural translation. Using the
designed layers, we build a CNN that we train using the initial set of signals.
Contrary to other approaches that aim at extending CNNs to irregular domains,
we incorporate the classical settings of CNNs for 2D signals as a particular
case of our approach. Designing convolutional layers in the vertex domain
directly implies weight sharing, which in other approaches is generally
estimated a posteriori using heuristics.

learning representations for multi-task RL (MT-RL), as multiple tasks can refer

which can achieve MT-RL within a single learned model. Specifically, the
architecture of GTN is composed of both horizontal and vertical streams. In our
GTN architecture, horizontal streams are used to learn representation shared in
similar tasks. In contrast, the vertical streams are introduced to be more
suitable for handling diverse tasks, which encodes hierarchical shared
knowledge of these tasks. The effectiveness of the introduced vertical stream
is validated by experimental results. Experimental results further verify that
our GTN architecture is able to advance the state-of-the-art MT-RL, via being
tested on 51 Atari games.

spectroscopic galaxy surveys in QSO fields at $z\sim2-3$. This enables us to
quantify the impact of the CGM/IGM on Ly$\alpha$ emission in an observationally
constrained, realistic cosmological environment. Our model predicts that the
CGM and IGM at these redshifts transmit $\approx80~\%$ of Ly$\alpha$ photons
after having escaped from galaxies. This implies that while the inter-stellar
medium primarily regulates Ly$\alpha$ escape, the CGM has a non-negligible
impact on the observed Ly$\alpha$ line properties and the inferred Ly$\alpha$
escape fraction, even at $z\sim 2-3$. Ly$\alpha$ scattering in the CGM and IGM
further introduces an environmental dependence in the (apparent) Ly$\alpha$
escape fraction, and the observed population of Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies:
the CGM/IGM more strongly suppresses direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies
in overdense regions in the Universe, and redistributes this emission into
brighter Ly$\alpha$ haloes. The resulting mean surface brightness profile of
the Ly$\alpha$ haloes is generally found to be a power-law $\propto r^{-2.4}$.
Although our model still contains arbitrariness, our results demonstrate how
(integral field) spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in QSO fields constrain
circumgalactic Ly$\alpha$ RT, and we discuss the potential of these models for
studying CGM physics and cosmology.

(SNIe), as one kind of distance indicator, has led their use in extragalactic
astronomy as secondary standard candles. In general, the empirical relationship
of SNIa on the absolute peak magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ is calibrated by Cepheid
variables in the near distance scale and directly extrapolated to much farther
distances. Two main problems arise. First, their calibration, in particular the
determination of $M_{\rm B}$, depends on the empirical relationship of Cepheid
variables, which suffers from various uncertainties. The second is related to
the homogeneity of SNIa in their true $M_{\rm B}$, which is known to be poor in
different environments. The observed GW signal of the coalescence of compact
binary systems and their electromagnetic counterparts provide the novel and
model-independent way to address these two problems. In the era of
second-generation GW detectors, the low-redshift GW sources provide a novel
method to calibrate the empirical relationship of SNIa, using their
self-calibrated distances. Here, we use the event GW170817 to calibrate the
empirical relationship in different low redshift ranges, and find that the
calibration results are consistent with the ones derived from the Cepheid
variables. Moreover, the uncertainties of $M_{\rm B}$ in both methods are also
comparable. By the observations of third-generation GW detectors, GW sources
can also be used to measure the values of $M_{\rm B}$ for the high-redshift
SNIe, which provides a unique opportunity to study the dependence of $M_{\rm
B}$ on the local environment, strength of gravity, and the intrinsic properties
of the explosion, in addition to test the homogeneity of standard candles. We
find that the uncertainties of $M_{\rm B}$ in both high and low redshifts are
more than one order of magnitude smaller than the current accuracy.

explaining the constraints on the heavy elements distribution in Jupiter

luminosity excess or the abnormally large radius of some hot Jupiters. This is
a state consisting of density staircases, in which convective layers are
separated by thin stably stratified interfaces. The efficiency of tidal
dissipation in a planet depends strongly on its internal structure. It is
crucial to improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving this
dissipation, since it has important consequences to predict the long-term
evolution of any planetary system. In this work, our goal is to study the
resulting tidal dissipation when internal waves are excited by other bodies
(such as the moons of giant planets) in a region of layered semi-convection. We
find that the rates of tidal dissipation can be significantly enhanced in a
layered semi-convective medium compared to a uniformly convective medium,
especially in the astrophysically relevant sub-inertial frequency range. Thus,
layered semi-convection is a possible candidate to explain high tidal
dissipation rates recently observed in Jupiter and Saturn.

star for- mation processes over cosmological timescales. Since nitrogen can be
produced both in massive and intermediate-mass stars with metallicity-dependent
yields, its evolution is challenging to model, as evidenced by the differences
between theoretical predictions and observations. In this work we attempt to
identify the sources of these discrepancies using a cosmic evolution model. To
further complicate matters, there is considerable dispersion in the abundances
from observations of DLAs at redshift 2 - 3. We study the evolution of nitrogen
with a detailed chemical evolution model and find good agreement with
observations, including the relative abundances of N/O and N/Si ratios. We find
that the principal contribution of nitrogen comes from intermediate mass stars,
with the exception of systems with the lowest N/H, where nitrogen production
might possibly be dominated by massive stars. This last result could be
strengthened if stellar rotation which is important at low metallicity can
produce significant amounts of nitrogen. Moreover, these systems likely reside
in host galaxies with stellar masses below 10**8.5 solar mass. We also study
the origin of the observed dispersion in nitrogen abundances using the
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations Horizon-AGN. We conclude that this
dispersion can originate from two effects: differ- ence in the masses of the
DLA host galaxies, and difference in the their position inside the galaxy.

the vacancy, except for the elements of groups 11 and 12, and noble gases, for
which the contribution of dispersion interaction to bonding is most
significant. The strength of the interaction with the vacancy correlates with
the cohesive energy of the elements in their stable phases: the higher the
cohesive energy is the stronger bonding to the vacancy can be expected. As most
atoms can be trapped at the SV site we have calculated the potentials of
dissolution and found that in most cases the metals adsorbed at the vacancy are
more ""noble"" than they are in their corresponding stable phases.

movement of data between main memory and external memory (disk), rather than
actual (CPU) computation time, is often the bottleneck in the computation.
Since data is moved between disk and main memory in large contiguous blocks,
this has led to the development of a large number of I/O-efficient algorithms
that minimize the number of such block movements.
  TPIE is one of two major libraries that have been developed to support
I/O-efficient algorithm implementations. TPIE provides an interface where list
stream processing and sorting can be implemented in a simple and modular way
without having to worry about memory management or block movement. However, if
care is not taken, such streaming-based implementations can lead to practically
inefficient algorithms since lists of data items are typically written to (and
read from) disk between components.
  In this paper we present a major extension of the TPIE library that includes
a pipelining framework that allows for practically efficient streaming-based
implementations while minimizing I/O-overhead between streaming components. The
framework pipelines streaming components to avoid I/Os between components, that
is, it processes several components simultaneously while passing output from
one component directly to the input of the next component in main memory. TPIE
automatically determines which components to pipeline and performs the required
main memory management, and the extension also includes support for
parallelization of internal memory computation and progress tracking across an
entire application. The extended library has already been used to evaluate
I/O-efficient algorithms in the research literature and is heavily used in
I/O-efficient commercial terrain processing applications by the Danish startup
SCALGO.

  figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vagueness and uncertainty management is counted among one of the challenges
that remain unresolved in systems that generate texts from non-linguistic data,
known as data-to-text systems. In the last decade, work in fuzzy linguistic
summarization and description of data has raised the interest of using fuzzy
sets to model and manage the imprecision of human language in data-to-text
systems. However, despite some research in this direction, there has not been
an actual clear discussion and justification on how fuzzy sets can contribute
to data-to-text for modeling vagueness and uncertainty in words and
expressions. This paper intends to bridge this gap by answering the following
questions: What does vagueness mean in fuzzy sets theory? What does vagueness
mean in data-to-text contexts? In what ways can fuzzy sets theory contribute to
improve data-to-text systems? What are the challenges that researchers from
both disciplines need to address for a successful integration of fuzzy sets
into data-to-text systems? In what cases should the use of fuzzy sets be
avoided in D2T? For this, we review and discuss the state of the art of
vagueness modeling in natural language generation and data-to-text, describe
potential and actual usages of fuzzy sets in data-to-text contexts, and provide
some additional insights about the engineering of data-to-text systems that
make use of fuzzy set-based techniques.

of disorder on the electronic structure of InAs/GaSb bilayers was studied by
the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resistance of a dual-gated
heterostructures gate-tuned through the inverted to normal gap regimes.
Conduction in the inverted (predicted topological) regime was qualitatively
similar to behavior in a disordered two-dimensional system. The impact of
charged impurities and interface roughness on the formation of topologically
protected edge states and an insulating bulk was estimated. The experimental
evidence and estimates of disorder in the potential landscape indicated the
potential fluctuations in state-of-the-art films are sufficiently strong such
that conduction in the predicted topological insulator (TI) regime was
dominated by a symplectic metal phase rather than a TI phase. The implications
are that future efforts must address disorder in this system and focus must be
placed on the reduction of defects and disorder in these heterostructures if a
TI regime is to be achieved.

Model inference performed on the resulting observed sample will be biased for

unbiased inference employs marginal inclusion probabilities to form sampling
weights used to exponentiate each likelihood contribution of a pseudo
likelihood used to form a pseudo posterior distribution. Conditions for
posterior consistency restrict applicable sampling designs to those under which
pairwise inclusion dependencies asymptotically limit to 0. There are many
sampling designs excluded by this restriction; for example, a multi-stage
design that samples individuals within households. Viewing each household as a
population, the dependence among individuals does not attenuate. We propose a
more targeted approach in this paper for inference focused on pairs of
individuals or sampled units; for example, the substance use of one spouse in a
shared household, conditioned on the substance use of the other spouse. We
formulate the pseudo likelihood with weights based on pairwise or second order
probabilities and demonstrate consistency, removing the requirement for
asymptotic independence and replacing it with restrictions on higher order

programme that aims to detect Earth-like planets orbiting low-mass stars.
  Aims: We develop least-squares fitting algorithms to derive the RVs and
additional spectral diagnostics implemented in the SpEctrum Radial Velocity
Analyser (SERVAL), a publicly available python code.
  Methods: We measured the RVs using high signal-to-noise templates created by
coadding all available spectra of each star.We define the chromatic index as
the RV gradient as a function of wavelength with the RVs measured in the
echelle orders. Additionally, we computed the differential line width by
correlating the fit residuals with the second derivative of the template to
track variations in the stellar line width.
  Results: Using HARPS data, our SERVAL code achieves a RV precision at the
level of 1m/s. Applying the chromatic index to CARMENES data of the active star
YZ CMi, we identify apparent RV variations induced by stellar activity. The
differential line width is found to be an alternative indicator to the commonly
used full width half maximum.
  Conclusions: We find that at the red optical wavelengths (700--900 nm)
obtained by the visual channel of CARMENES, the chromatic index is an excellent
tool to investigate stellar active regions and to identify and perhaps even
correct for activity-induced RV variations.

This problem exhibits wide-ranging applications and the specific application we

which it cannot observe the patroller's complete trajectory. Instead, we allow
the learner to listen to the expert's movement sound, which it can also use to
estimate the expert's state and action using an observation model. We treat the
expert's state and action as hidden data and present an algorithm based on
expectation maximization and maximum entropy principle to solve the non-linear,
non-convex problem. Related work considers discrete-time observations and an
observation model that does not include actions. In contrast, our technique
takes expectations over both state and action of the expert, enabling learning

supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking non-holomorphic (NH) terms can be soft breaking
in nature so that they may be considered along with the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) and beyond. There have been studies related to these
terms in minimal supergravity based models. Consideration of an F-type SUSY
breaking scenario in the hidden sector with two chiral superfields however
showed Planck scale suppression of such terms. In an unbiased point of view for
the sources of SUSY breaking, the NH terms in a phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM)
type of analysis showed a possibility of a large SUSY contribution to muon
$g-2$, a reasonable amount of corrections to the Higgs boson mass and a drastic
reduction of the electroweak fine-tuning for a higgsino dominated
$\widetilde{\chi}^0_1$ in some regions of parameter space. We first investigate
here the effects of the NH terms in a low scale SUSY breaking scenario. In our
analysis with minimal gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (mGMSB) we probe
how far the results can be compared with the previous pMSSM plus NH terms based
study. We particularly analyze the Higgs, stop and the electroweakino sectors
focusing on a higgsino dominated $\widetilde{\chi}^0_1$ and
$\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1$, a feature typically different from what appears in
mGMSB. The effect of a limited degree of RG evolutions and vanishing of the
trilinear coupling terms at the messenger scale can be overcome by choosing a
non-minimal GMSB scenario, such as one with a matter-messenger interaction.

discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new
perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take
advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing
new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a
linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the
linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The
LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like
networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the
networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt
respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on
both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In
particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly
compress ($>50$\%) the original networks while maintaining a similar
performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified
equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a
connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training
process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by
relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can
easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture. As
an example, we introduced stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant
improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.

(RRTs), pose two fundamental challenges: computing a reliable (pseudo-)metric
for the distance between two randomly sampled nodes, and computing a steering
input to connect the nodes. The core of these challenges is a Two Point
Boundary Value Problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Recently, the distance
metric has been approximated using supervised learning, reducing computation
time drastically. The previous work on such learning RRTs use direct optimal
control to generate the data for supervised learning. This paper proposes to
use indirect optimal control instead, because it provides two benefits: it
reduces the computational effort to generate the data, and it provides a low
dimensional parametrization of the action space. The latter allows us to learn
both the distance metric and the steering input to connect two nodes. This
eliminates the need for a local planner in learning RRTs. Experimental results
on a pendulum swing up show 10-fold speed-up in both the offline data
generation and the online planning time, leading to at least a 10-fold speed-up
in the overall planning time.

the unusual finding that molecular orientation heavily influences heat flow

thermal conductivity of vapour-deposited thin-film semiconductor glasses is
anisotropic and controlled by the deposition temperature. We compare our data
with extensive molecular dynamics simulations to disentangle the role of
density and molecular orientation on heat propagation. Simulations do support
the view that thermal transport along the backbone of the organic molecule is
strongly preferred with respect to the perpendicular direction. This is due to
the anisotropy of the molecular interaction strength that limit the transport

variational spiral orders of the magnetic moments, the phase diagram in the

bosons. Electron--positron collision experiments at the B-factories provide the
most straightforward way to probe bosons of this kind. In the present article
we study production of the bosons at $e^+e^-$ colliders operating at GeV
center-of-mass energies. We have studied two channels: $e^+e^-\rightarrow
\gamma Z'$ and $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-Z'$. Analytic expressions for the cross
sections and various observables such as the energy spectra of the produced
bosons and the final electrons from the $Z'$ decays are derived. We have also
studied the transverse momentum distribution of the bosons and the spatial
distribution of the $Z'\rightarrow e^+e^-$ decay vertices. It is shown that
these distributions provide distinct signatures of the bosons in
$e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma Z'$. The reaction $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-Z'$ becomes
important at small $Z'$ scattering angles where its contribution to the overall
yield may be larger by orders of magnitude compared to $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma
Z'$. The standard processes $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ and
$e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$ that lead to the same signal are considered.
We include numerical predictions for the production rates at the energy
$\sqrt{s}=10.5$ GeV. The case with a light scalar boson is also discussed. The
calculations are performed in detail and can be useful for additional studies.

approximate elliptic interface problems. The curved interface can cut through
the mesh cells in a very general fashion. As in classical HHO methods, the
present unfitted method introduces cell and face unknowns in uncut cells, but
doubles the unknowns in the cut cells and on the cut faces. The main difference
with classical HHO methods is that a Nitsche-type formulation is used to devise
the local reconstruction operator. As in classical HHO methods, cell unknowns
can be eliminated locally leading to a global problem coupling only the face
unknowns by means of a compact stencil. We prove stability estimates and
optimal error estimates in the $H^1$-norm. Robustness with respect to cuts is
achieved by a local cell-agglomeration procedure taking full advantage of the
fact that HHO methods support polyhedral meshes. Robustness with respect to the
contrast in the material properties from both sides of the interface is
achieved by using material-dependent weights in Nitsche's formulation.

serve as a link between electromagnetic modes of vastly different frequencies.
This approach has successfully been exploited for the frequency conversion of
classical signals and has the potential of performing quantum state transfer
between superconducting circuitry and a traveling optical signal. Such
transducers are often operated in a linear regime, where the hybrid system can
be described using linear response theory based on the Heisenberg-Langevin
equations. While mathematically straightforward to solve, this approach yields
little intuition about the dynamics of the hybrid system to aid the
optimization of the transducer. As an analysis and design tool for such
electro-optomechanical transducers, we introduce an equivalent circuit
formalism, where the entire transducer is represented by an electrical circuit.
Thereby we integrate the transduction functionality of optomechanical systems
into the toolbox of electrical engineering allowing the use of its
well-established design techniques. This unifying impedance description can be
applied both for static (DC) and harmonically varying (AC) drive fields,
accommodates arbitrary linear circuits, and is not restricted to the
resolved-sideband regime. Furthermore, by establishing the quantized
input-output formalism for the equivalent circuit, we obtain the scattering
matrix for linear transducers using circuit analysis, and thereby have a
complete quantum mechanical characterization of the transducer. Hence, this
mapping of the entire transducer to the language of electrical engineering both
sheds light on how the transducer performs and can at the same time be used to
optimize its performance by aiding the design of a suitable electrical circuit.

provide us with details about separated background components. From the
strongest background lines, we first determine how the spectral response
changes with time. We then determine how the instrumental background components
change in intensities and other characteristics, most-importantly their
relative distribution among detectors. Spectral resolution of Ge detectors in
space degrades with time, up to 15% within half a year, consistently for all
detectors, and across the SPI energy range. Semi-annual annealing operations
recover these losses, yet there is a small long-term degradation. The intensity
of instrumental background varies anti-correlated to solar activity, in
general. There are significant differences among different lines and with
respect to continuum. Background lines are found to have a characteristic,
well-defined and long-term consistent intensity ratio among detectors. We use
this to categorise lines in groups of similar behaviour. The dataset of

the ubiquitous presence of properties which seem to characterize many -

plants-pollinator as well as in country-product trade networks. This has raised
questions about the significance of these patterns, which are often believed to
constitute a genuine signature of self-organization. Here, we review several
methods that have been developed for the analysis of such evidence. Due to the
interdisciplinary character of complex networks, tools developed in one field,
for example ecology, can greatly enrich other areas of research, such as
economy and finance, and vice versa. With this in mind, we briefly review
several entropy-based bipartite null models that have been recently proposed
and discuss their application to several real-world systems. The focus on these
models is motivated by the fact that they show three very desirable features:
analytical character, general applicability and versatility. In this respect,
entropy-based methods have been proven to perform satisfactorily both in
providing benchmarks for testing evidence-based null hypotheses and in
reconstructing unknown network configurations from partial information. On top
of that, entropy-based models have been successfully employed to analyze
ecological as well as economic systems, thus representing an ideal,
interdisciplinary tool to approach the study of bipartite complex systems.

impossible to identify this state at present. It is found that the channel
$\Lambda D$ vanishes in the strong decay of $P$-wave, $D$-wave and $2S$-wave
excited $\Xi_c$ without $\rho$- mode excitation between the two light quarks
($n_\rho=L_\rho=0$). Some branching fraction ratios have been computed and can
be employed to distinguish different configurations in forthcoming experiments.

over-parameterized regime, where the number of network parameters exceeds the

networks fail to explain this phenomenon. In an attempt to bridge this gap, we
study the problem of learning a two-layer over-parameterized neural network,
when the data is generated by a linearly separable function. In the case where
the network has Leaky ReLU activations, we provide both optimization and
generalization guarantees for over-parameterized networks. Specifically, we
prove convergence rates of SGD to a global minimum and provide generalization
guarantees for this global minimum that are independent of the network size.
Therefore, our result clearly shows that the use of SGD for optimization both
finds a global minimum, and avoids overfitting despite the high capacity of the
model. This is the first theoretical demonstration that SGD can avoid
overfitting, when learning over-specified neural network classifiers.

through optical to X-ray band, with numerous emission and absorption features.
However, Boroson & Green (1992) used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
with this analysis they were able to show significant correlations between the
measured parameters. The leading component, related to Eigenvector 1 (EV1) was
dominated by the anticorrelation between the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ optical emission
and [OIII] line and EV1 alone contained 30% of the total variance. It opened a
way in defining a quasar main sequence, in close analogy to the stellar main
sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram (Sulentic et al. 2001). The
question still remains which of the basic theoretically motivated parameters of
an active nucleus (Eddington ratio, black hole mass, accretion rate, spin, and
viewing angle) is the main driver behind the EV1. Here we limit ourselves to
the optical waveband, and concentrate on theoretical modelling the
Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to H$\mathrm{\beta}$ ratio, and we test the hypothesis that
the physical driver of EV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk temperature,
reflected in the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We performed
computations of the H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and optical Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ for a broad
range of SED peak position using CLOUDY photoionisation code. We assumed that
both H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ emission come from the Broad Line
Region represented as a constant density cloud in a plane-parallel geometry. We
expected that a hotter disk continuum will lead to more efficient production of
Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ but our computations show that the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to
H$\mathrm{\beta}$ ratio actually drops with the rise of the disk temperature.
Thus either hypothesis is incorrect, or approximations used in our paper for
the description of the line emissivity is inadequate.

interferometer. The broad (FWHM$\sim750\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) and tentative
double-peaked profiles of both $^{12}$CO lines are consistent with an extended
molecular gas reservoir, which is distributed in a rotating disk as previously
revealed from [CII] 158$\mu$m line observations. Based on the
$^{12}$CO(2$\to$1) emission line we derived
$L'_{\rm{CO}}=(3.4\pm0.6)\times10^{10}{\rm \,K\,km\,s}^{-1}{\rm \,pc}^{2}$,
that yields a molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm H_2 }(\alpha_{\rm

with $\mu_{\rm gas}(\alpha_{\rm CO}/4.3)\equiv M_{\rm H_2}/M_\star=3.3\pm0.7$.

ratio $L_{\rm{IR}}/L'_{\rm{CO}}=(216\pm80)\, {\rm L}_{\odot}{\rm

starbursts such as local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and SMGs.
Likewise, the $^{12}$CO(5$\to$4)/CO(2$\to$1) line brightness temperature ratio
of $r_{52}= 0.55\pm 0.15$ is consistent with high excitation conditions,
similar to that observed in SMGs. We constrained the value for the
$L'_{\text{CO}}-{\rm H}_2$ mass conversion factor in AzTEC/C159, i.e.
$\alpha_{\text{CO}}=3.9^{+2.7}_{-1.3}{\rm \,M}_{\odot}{\rm \,K}^{-1}{\rm
\,km}^{-1}{\rm \,s\,pc}^{-2}$, that is consistent with a self-gravitating
molecular gas distribution as observed in local star-forming disk galaxies.
Cold gas streams from cosmological filaments might be fueling a gravitationally
unstable gas-rich disk in AzTEC/C159, which breaks into giant clumps forming
stars as efficiently as in merger-driven systems and generate high gas
excitation.

applications. However, photo/sketch synthesis remains a challenging problem due
to the fact that photo and sketch have different characteristics. In this work,
we consider this task as an image-to-image translation problem and explore the
recently popular generative models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic
photos from sketches and sketches from photos. Recent GAN-based methods have
shown promising results on image-to-image translation problems and
photo-to-sketch synthesis in particular, however, they are known to have
limited abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images. To this end,
we propose a novel synthesis framework called Photo-Sketch Synthesis using
Multi-Adversarial Networks, (PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution
to high resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of the
generator are supervised to first generate lower resolution images followed by
implicit refinement in the network to generate higher resolution images.
Furthermore, since photo-sketch synthesis is a coupled/paired translation
problem, we leverage the pair information using CycleGAN framework. Both Image
Quality Assessment (IQA) and Photo-Sketch Matching experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in comparison to existing
state-of-the-art solutions. Code available at:

must rely on the investigation of the Lyman Continuum (LyC) properties of z<5
star-forming galaxies, where we can still directly observe their ionizing
radiation. We selected a sample of 201 star-forming galaxies from the Vimos
Ultra Deep Survey at 3.5<z<4.3 to explore the validity of some of the proposed
indirect indicators of LyC radiation. We created subsamples of galaxies with
EWLya>70{\AA}, Lya(ext)<5.7kpc, rUV<0.3kpc and |Dv Lya|<200km/s, stacked all
the galaxies in each subsample and measured the flux density ratio
fnu(895)/fnu(1470), that we consider to be a proxy for LyC emission. We
compared these ratios to those obtained for the complementary samples. We find
that the stacks of galaxies which are UV compact (rUV<0.3kpc) and have bright
Lya emission (EWLya>70{\AA}), have much higher LyC fluxes compared to the rest
of the galaxy population in agreement with theoretical studies and previous
observational works. We also find that galaxies with low Lya(ext) have the
highest LyC flux: this new correlation seems even stronger than the
correlations with high EWLya and small rUV. These results assume that the
stacks from all the subsamples present the same statistical contamination from
lower redshift interlopers. If we subtract a statistical contamination from low
redshift interlopers obtained with dedicated Monte Carlo simulations, from the
flux density ratios (fnu(895)/fnu(1470)) of the significant subsamples we find
that these samples contain real LyC leaking flux with a very high probability,
but the true average escape fractions remain uncertain. Our work indicates that
galaxies with very high EWLya, small Lya(ext) and small rUV are very likely the
best candidates to show LyC radiation at z=4 and could therefore be the
galaxies that contributed more to reionization.

nitride (hBN) promises exciting opportunities for electron-optics devices. A
narrow electron beam is desired, with both the mean free path and coherence
length exceeding the device size. One can form a collimating contact in
graphene by adding zigzag contacts on either side of the electron emitter that
absorb stray electrons to form a collimated electron beam [23]. Here we provide
images of electron flow from a collimating contact that directly show the width
and shape of the electron beam, obtained using a Scanning Gate Microscope (SGM)
cooled to 4.2 K. The device is a hBN-encapsulated graphene hall bar with narrow
side contacts on either side of the channel that have an electron emitter at
the end and absorbing zig-zag contacts at both side. To form an image of
electron flow, the SGM tip is raster scanned at a constant height above the
sample surface while the transmission to a receiving contact on opposite sides
of the channel is measured. By displaying the change {\Delta}T vs. tip
position, an image of ballistic flow is obtained. The angular width of the
electron beam leaving the collimating contact is found by applying a
perpendicular magnetic field B that bends electron paths into cyclotron orbits.
SGM images reveal that electron flow from a collimating contact disappears
quickly at B = 0.05T while the flow from a non-collimating contact persists up
to B = 0.19 T. Ray tracing simulations agree well with the experimental images
over a range of B and electron density n. By fitting the half-width at half-max
(HWHM) of the magnitude of electron flow in the experimental SGM images, we
find a narrow half angular width {\Delta}{\theta} = 9.2{\deg} for the electron
flow from the collimating contact, compared with a wide flow {\Delta}{\theta} =
54{\deg} from the non-collimating contact.

  Novel Patch Selection Method with Moment",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Biologically inspired model (BIM) for image recognition is a robust
computational architecture, which has attracted widespread attention. BIM can
be described as a four-layer structure based on the mechanisms of the visual
cortex. Although the performance of BIM for image recognition is robust, it
takes the randomly selected ways for the patch selection, which is sightless,
and results in heavy computing burden. To address this issue, we propose a
novel patch selection method with oriented Gaussian-Hermite moment (PSGHM), and
we enhanced the BIM based on the proposed PSGHM, named as PBIM. In contrast to
the conventional BIM which adopts the random method to select patches within
the feature representation layers processed by multi-scale Gabor filter banks,
the proposed PBIM takes the PSGHM way to extract a small number of
representation features while offering promising distinctiveness. To show the
effectiveness of the proposed PBIM, experimental studies on object
categorization are conducted on the CalTech05, TU Darmstadt (TUD), and GRAZ01
databases. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of PBIM is a
significant improvement on that of the conventional BIM.

Heisenberg J interactions as in the case of d^5 ions. However, we find that the
presence of additional, spin-active e_g electrons radically changes the balance
between Kitaev and Heisenberg couplings. Most remarkably, we show that the
exchange processes involving e_g spins are highly sensitive to whether the

In the latter case, to which many cobalt compounds do actually belong, the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg coupling J is strongly suppressed and spin-liquid

promising candidates for the realization of the Kitaev model.

the matter domination, entering into a late-time accelerated expansion, and

necessary requirement of many critical infrastructure systems. In pursuit of
this goal, this paper builds a systematic design framework of feedback
controllers for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems that continuously track the
optimal solution of some predefined optimization problem. The proposed solution
can be logically divided into three components. The first component estimates
the system state from the output measurements. The second component uses the
estimated state and computes a drift direction based on an optimization
algorithm. The third component computes an input to the LTI system that aims to
drive the system toward the optimal steady-state.
  We analyze the equilibrium characteristics of the closed-loop system and
provide conditions for optimality and stability. Our analysis shows that the
proposed solution guarantees optimal steady-state performance, even in the
presence of constant disturbances. Furthermore, by leveraging recent results on
the analysis of optimization algorithms using integral quadratic constraints
(IQCs), the proposed framework is able to translate input-output properties of
our optimization component into sufficient conditions, based on linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs), for global exponential asymptotic stability of the closed
loop system. We illustrate the versatility of our framework using several

bosons are derived directly from physical constraints such as locality,
symmetry and unitarity, bypassing path integral constructions. Amplitudes can
be projected onto a minimal basis of kinematic factors through linear algebra,
by employing four dimensional spinor helicity methods or at its most general
using projection techniques. The linear algebra analysis is closely related to
amplitude relations, especially the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations for gluon
amplitudes and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations between gluons and graviton
amplitudes. Projection techniques are known to reduce the computation of loop
amplitudes with spinning particles to scalar integrals. Unitarity, locality and
integration-by-parts identities can then be used to fix complete tree and loop
amplitudes efficiently. The loop amplitudes follow algorithmically from the
trees. A range of proof-of-concept examples is presented. These include the
planar four point two-loop amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory as well as a
range of one loop amplitudes with internal and external scalars, gluons and
gravitons. Several interesting features of the results are highlighted, such as
the vanishing of certain basis coefficients for gluon and graviton amplitudes.
Effective field theories are naturally and efficiently included into the
framework. The presented methods appear most powerful in non-supersymmetric
theories in cases with relatively few legs, but with potentially many loops.
For instance, iterated unitarity cuts of four point amplitudes for
non-supersymmetric gauge and gravity theories can be computed by matrix
multiplication, generalising the so-called rung-rule of maximally
supersymmetric theories. The philosophy of the approach to kinematics also
leads to a technique to control color quantum numbers of scattering amplitudes
with matter.

the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the localization of sources

  In this note, the authors investigate the conditions for which this spectral
sequence degenerates on the first page when the underlying complex manifolds
are nilmanifolds with an abelian complex structure. For a particular class of

  The compression of the target pellet can be moderate and rapid volume
ignition is achieved by a laser pulse, which is as short as the penetration
time of the light across the pellet. The reflectivity of the target can be made
negligible, and the absorptivity can be increased by one or two orders of
magnitude by plasmonic nano-shells embedded in the target fuel. Thus, higher
ignition temperature can be achieved with modest compression. The short light
pulse can heat the target so that most of the interior will reach the ignition
temperature simultaneously. This makes the development of any kind of
instability impossible, which would prevent complete ignition of the target.

B1913+16, B1953+29 and J1022+1001, seem to exhibit core/single-cone profiles.
These configurations are remarkable and important because it has not been clear
whether MSPs and slow pulsars exhibit similar emission-beam configurations,
given that they have considerably smaller magnetospheric sizes and magnetic
field strengths. MSPs thus provide an extreme context for studying pulsar radio
emission. Particle currents along the magnetic polar flux tube connect
processes just above the polar cap through the radio-emission region to the
light-cylinder and the external environment. In slow pulsars radio-emission
heights are typically about 500 km around where the magnetic field is nearly
dipolar, and estimates of the physical conditions there point to radiation
below the plasma frequency and emission from charged solitons by the curvature
process. We are able to estimate emission heights for the four MSPs and carry
out a similar estimation of physical conditions in their much lower emission
regions. We find strong evidence that MSPs also radiate by curvature emission
from charged solitons.

transition of neutral hydrogen from the early universe. These telescopes have
the potential to directly probe star and galaxy formation at redshifts $20
\gtrsim z \gtrsim 7$, but are limited by the dynamic range they can achieve
against foreground sources of low-frequency radio emission. Consequently, there
is a growing demand for modern, high-fidelity maps of the sky at frequencies
below 200 MHz for use in foreground modeling and removal. We describe a new
widefield imaging technique for drift-scanning interferometers,
Tikhonov-regularized $m$-mode analysis imaging. This technique constructs
images of the entire sky in a single synthesis imaging step with exact
treatment of widefield effects. We describe how the CLEAN algorithm can be
adapted to deconvolve maps generated by $m$-mode analysis imaging. We
demonstrate Tikhonov-regularized $m$-mode analysis imaging using the Owens
Valley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) by generating 8 new maps of the sky
north of $\delta=-30^\circ$ with 15 arcmin angular resolution, at frequencies
evenly spaced between 36.528 MHz and 73.152 MHz, and $\sim$800 mJy/beam thermal
noise. These maps are a 10-fold improvement in angular resolution over existing
full-sky maps at comparable frequencies, which have angular resolutions $\ge
2^\circ$. Each map is constructed exclusively from interferometric observations
and does not represent the globally averaged sky brightness. Future
improvements will incorporate total power radiometry, improved thermal noise,
and improved angular resolution -- due to the planned expansion of the OVRO-LWA
to 2.6 km baselines. These maps serve as a first step on the path to the use of
more sophisticated foreground filters in 21-cm cosmology incorporating the
measured angular and frequency structure of all foreground contaminants.

dispersion relation derived for electrostatic waves demonstrates a weak
dependence of the phase speed on physical conditions of positrons in
appropriate ranges of parameters. The Sagdeev's pseudopotential approach is
used to obtain the existence of electrostatic solitary wave structures,
focusing on how their characteristics depend on the physical conditions of
positrons and suprathermal electrons. Both negative and positive polarity
electrostatic solitary waves are found to exist in different ranges of Mach
numbers. As the positrons constitute a small fraction of the total number
density, they slightly affect the existence domains. However, the positrons can
significantly change the wave potential at a fixed soliton speed. The results
indicate that the positive potential can greatly be grown by increasing the
electron suprathermality (lower $\kappa$) at a fixed true Mach number. It is
found that a fraction of positrons maintain the generation of positive polarity
electrostatic solitary waves in the presence of suprathermal electrons in pair
plasmas.

These systems are usually distributed, heterogeneous, decentralised and

environments. Finding ways to understand and design these systems and, most of
all, to model the interactions of their components, is a difficult but
important endeavour. In this article we propose a language-based approach for

attribute-based communication; a paradigm that permits a group of partners to
communicate by considering their run-time properties and capabilities. We
introduce AbC, a foundational calculus for attribute-based communication and
show how its linguistic primitives can be used to program a complex and
sophisticated variant of the well-known problem of Stable Allocation in Content

collective-adaptive systems, are considered. We also illustrate the expressive
power of attribute-based communication by showing the natural encoding of other

introduced in Sakov et al. (2012) to extend the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)

  However, the IEnKF assumes that the model is perfect. This assumption
simplified the update of the system at a time different from the observation
time, which made it natural to apply the IEnKF for smoothing. In this study, we
generalise the IEnKF to the case of imperfect model with additive model error.
  The new method called IEnKF-Q conducts a Gauss-Newton minimisation in
ensemble space. It combines the propagated analysed ensemble anomalies from the
previous cycle and model noise ensemble anomalies into a single ensemble of
anomalies, and by doing so takes an algebraic form similar to that of the

sometimes even pin-pointed as a natural cause of concentrations, including
accumulation of resources in human society. Although coherent with theory and
empirical data, there are at least three aspects of scale-free networks that
are egalitarian. Using the social network metaphor (which is easier to grasp):
1) the presence of each agent (vertex or component) in diverse networks, while
each agent has the same amount of resources (e.g. time) for engaging
(establishing links or edges) with other individual agents, ideas or objects;
2) the constant change in the concentration of resources (in this case, links)
of each agent; 3) the uniform distribution of resources with respect to the
amount of resources per agent (the more resources per agent, the fewer the
agents). We also consider the importance of vertices that are not hubs and
overstatements on the importance of the hubs. The conclusions suggest the urge
of research to better examine and model the relevance of the vertices that are
not hubs (i.e. peripheral and intermediary) and verify the need to better
weight the emphasis current literature places in the association of inequality
to the scale-free networks (and other phenomena in which power laws are found).

challenging since the implementation of the sophisticated optimization
algorithms must be done with reasonable computational resources. In the real
implementation of MIMO precoding systems, the processing time for each set of
symbols is a crucial parameter, especially in the high-throughput mode. In this
work, a symbol-level optimization algorithm with reduced complexity is devised.
Performance of a symbol-level precoder is shown to improve in terms of the
processing times per set of symbols.

  Formalism","23 pages",,"10.1063/1.4994243",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The seek for a new universal formulation for describing various
non-equilibrium processes is a central task of modern non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. In this paper, a novel steady-state thermodynamic formalism was
established for general Markov processes described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov
equation. Furthermore, corresponding formalisms of steady-state thermodynamics
for master equation and Fokker-Planck equation could be rigorously derived in
mathematics. To be concrete, we proved that: 1) in the limit of continuous
time, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the Chapman-Kolmogorov
equation fully agrees with that for the master equation; 2) a similar
one-to-one correspondence could be established rigorously between the master
equation and Fokker-Planck equation in the limit of large system size; 3) when
a Markov process is restrained to one-step jump, the steady-state thermodynamic
formalism for the Fokker-Planck equation with discrete state variables also
goes to that for master equations, as the discretization step gets smaller and
smaller. Our analysis indicated that, with respect to the steady state, general
Markov processes admit a unified and self-consistent non-equilibrium
thermodynamic formulation, regardless of underlying detailed models.

embedded GaN/AlN superlattice. The heterostructure dimensions and doping
profile were designed in such a way that the application of positive or
negative bias leads to an enhancement of the collection of photogenerated
carriers from the GaN/AlN superlattice or from the GaN base, respectively, as
confirmed by electron beam-induced current measurements. The devices display
enhanced response in the ultraviolet A ($\approx$ 330-360 nm) / B ($\approx$
280-330 nm) spectral windows under positive/negative bias. The result is
explained by correlation of the photocurrent measurements with scanning
transmission electron microscopy observations of the same single nanowire, and
semi-classical simulations of the strain and band structure in one and three
dimensions.

  Fields and Bayesian Networks",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a method for generalizing the Ising model in magnetic fields and
calculating the partition function (exact solution) for the Ising model of an
arbitrary shape. Specifically, the partition function is calculated using
matrices that are created automatically based on the structure of the system.
By generalizing this method, it becomes possible to calculate the partition
function of various crystal systems (network shapes) in magnetic fields when N
(scale) is infinite. Furthermore, we also connect this method for finding the
solution to the Ising model in magnetic fields to a method for finding the
solution to Bayesian networks in information statistical mechanics (applied to
data mining, machine learning, and combinatorial optimization).
