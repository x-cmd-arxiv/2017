this pioneering study we use naive fermions and work in the quenched

optimize radio access networks via a control-data plane separation.
Nevertheless, reaping the benefits of wireless SDN hinges on making optimal use
of the limited wireless fronthaul capacity. In this work, the problem of
fronthaul-aware resource allocation and user scheduling is studied. To this
end, a two-timescale fronthaul-aware SDN control mechanism is proposed in which
the controller maximizes the time-averaged network throughput by enforcing a
coarse correlated equilibrium in the long timescale. Subsequently, leveraging
the controller's recommendations, each base station schedules its users using
Lyapunov stochastic optimization in the short timescale, i.e., at each time
slot. Simulation results show that significant network throughput enhancements
and up to 40% latency reduction are achieved with the aid of the SDN
controller. Moreover, the gains are more pronounced for denser network
deployments.

superconducting contributions from complex normal state behaviour. Here we
avoid this problem by measuring the nonlinear conductivity, an observable that
is zero in the normal state. We uncover for several representative cuprates
that the nonlinear conductivity vanishes exponentially above $T_c$, both with
temperature and magnetic field, and exhibits temperature-scaling characterized
by a nearly universal scale $T_0$. Attempts to model the response with the
frequently evoked Ginzburg-Landau theory are unsuccessful. Instead, our

properties of the cuprates. We thus resolve a long-standing conundrum by
showing that the emergence of superconductivity in the cuprates is dominated by
their inherent inhomogeneity.

nonaxisymmetric solutions at around 1.8 times the solar rotation rate. This
transition coincides with a change in the rotation profile from antisolar- to
solar-like differential rotation with a faster equator and slow poles. In the
solar-like rotation regime, the field configuration consists of an axisymmetric
oscillatory field accompanied by an m=1 azimuthal mode (two active longitudes),
which also shows temporal variability. At slow (rapid) rotation, the
axisymmetric (nonaxisymmetric) mode dominates. The axisymmetric mode produces
latitudinal dynamo waves with polarity reversals, while the nonaxisymmetric
mode often exhibits a drift in the rotating reference frame and the strength of
the active longitudes changes cyclically over time between the different
hemispheres. Most of the obtained dynamo solutions exhibit cyclic variability
either caused by latitudinal or azimuthal dynamo waves. In an activity-period
diagram, the cycle lengths normalized by the rotation period form two different
populations as a function of rotation rate or magnetic activity level. The
slowly rotating axisymmetric population lies close to what is called the
inactive branch in observations, while the rapidly rotating models are close to
the superactive branch with a declining cycle to rotation frequency ratio with
increasing rotation rate. We can successfully reproduce the transition from
axi- to nonaxisymmetric dynamo solutions for high rotation rates, but
high-resolution simulations are required to limit the effect of rotational
quenching of convection at rotation rates above 20 times the solar value.

be successfully used to detect Flash malware by leveraging static analysis to
extract information from the structure of the file or its bytecode. However,
the robustness of Flash malware detectors against well-crafted evasion attempts

paper, we propose a security evaluation of a novel, representative Flash

by state-of-the-art tools. In particular, we discuss how to craft adversarial
Flash malware examples, showing that it suffices to manipulate the
corresponding source malware samples slightly to evade detection. We then
empirically demonstrate that popular defense techniques proposed to mitigate
evasion attempts, including re-training on adversarial examples, may not always
be sufficient to ensure robustness. We argue that this occurs when the feature
vectors extracted from adversarial examples become indistinguishable from those
of benign data, meaning that the given feature representation is intrinsically
vulnerable. In this respect, we are the first to formally define and
quantitatively characterize this vulnerability, highlighting when an attack can
be countered by solely improving the security of the learning algorithm, or
when it requires also considering additional features. We conclude the paper by
suggesting alternative research directions to improve the security of

They also include adsorption from and desorption into the neighboring fluids

illuminated by spots of light. Switching on a single light spot, the density of
the switched surfactant spreads in time and assumes an exponentially decaying

reverses its flow direction from inward to outward. We use this feature to set
up specific feedback rules, which couple the advection velocities sensed at the

vertices of regular polygons, we observe periodic switching patterns for
even-sided polygons, where two sets of next-nearest neighbors alternate with

properties of the ejected dust and the surface change at the site of the
outburst. The activity coincided with the local sunrise and continued over a
time interval of 14 - 68 minutes. It left a 10m-sized icy patch on the surface.
The ejected material comprised refractory grains of several hundred microns in
size, and sub-micron-sized water ice grains. The high dust mass production rate
is incompatible with the free sublimation of crystalline water ice under solar
illumination as the only acceleration process. Additional energy stored near
the surface must have increased the gas density. We suggest a pressurized
sub-surface gas reservoir, or the crystallization of amorphous water ice as
possible causes.

distribution in the Universe. The standard quadratic estimator, which is
typically used to measure the lensing signal, is known to be suboptimal for
low-noise polarization data from next-generation experiments. In this paper we
explain why the quadratic estimator will also be suboptimal for measuring
lensing on very small scales, even for measurements in temperature where this
estimator typically performs well. Though maximum likelihood methods could be
implemented to improve performance, we explore a much simpler solution,
revisiting a previously proposed method to measure lensing which involves a
direct inversion of the background gradient. An important application of this
simple formalism is the measurement of cluster masses with CMB lensing. We find
that directly applying a gradient inversion matched filter to simulated lensed
images of the CMB can tighten constraints on cluster masses compared to the
quadratic estimator. While the difference is not relevant for existing surveys,
for future surveys it can translate to significant improvements in mass
calibration for distant clusters, where galaxy lensing calibration is
ineffective due to the lack of enough resolved background galaxies.
Improvements can be as large as $\sim 50\%$ for a cluster at $z = 2$ and a
next-generation CMB experiment with 1$\mu$K-arcmin noise, and over an order of
magnitude for lower noise levels. For future surveys, this simple
matched-filter or gradient inversion method approaches the performance of
maximum likelihood methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.

calculations. We find that Al, Fe, Mo, and Ru impurities are energetically most
favorable when incorporated into Li$_2$MnO$_3$ at the Mn site, whereas Mg is
most favorable when doped at the Li sites. Ni, on the other hand, can be
incorporated at the Li site and/or the Mn site, and the distribution of Ni over
the lattice sites can be tuned by tuning the materials preparation conditions.
There is a strong interplay between the lattice site preference and charge and
spin states of the dopant, the electronic structure of the doped material, and
the delithiation mechanism. The calculated electronic structure and voltage
profile indicate that, in Ni-, Mo-, or Ru-doped Li$_2$MnO$_3$, oxidation occurs
on the electrochemically active transition-metal ion(s) before it does on
oxygen during the delithiation process. The role of the dopants is to provide
charge-compensation and bulk electronic conduction mechanisms in the initial
stages of delithiation, hence enabling the oxidation of the lattice oxygen in
the later stages. This work thus illustrates how the oxygen-oxidation mechanism
can be used in combination with the conventional mechanism involving
transition-metal cations in design of high-capacity battery cathode materials.

observation capabilities of the low frequency range (a few kHz to 100 MHz)
requires to go to space and to set up a space based network of antenna that can
be used as an interferometer.

Interferometer Observatory in Space) study which assessed, with help of CNES
PASO (Architecture Platform for Orbital Systems is CNES' cross-disciplinary
team in charge of early mission and concept studies), the feasibility of a
swarm of nanosatellites dedicated to a low frequency radio observatory. With
such a platform, space system engineering and instrument development must be
studied as a whole: each node is a sensor and all sensors must be used together
to obtain a measurement. The study was conducted on the following topics:
system principle and concept (swarm, node homogeneity); Space and time
management (ranging, clock synchronization); Orbitography (Moon orbit, Lagrange
point options); Telecommunication (between nodes and with ground) and
networking; Measurements and processing; Propulsion; Power; Electromagnetic
compatibility.
  No strong show-stopper was identified during the preliminary study, although
the concept is not yet ready. Several further studies and milestones are
identified. The NOIRE team will collaborate with international teams to try and
build this next generation of space systems.

many information measures such as entropy, conditional entropy, mutual

has been broad interest in generalizing the notion to further understand its
most basic properties, one of which is the data processing inequality. The
quantum f-divergence of Petz is one generalization of the quantum relative
entropy, and it also leads to other relative entropies, such as the Petz-Renyi

that it satisfies the data processing inequality, and the method of proof
relies upon the operator Jensen inequality, similar to Petz's original

examples of the optimized f-divergence. Thus, one benefit of this paper is that
there is now a single, unified approach for establishing the data processing

be viewed as two-dimensional generalizations of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, or
more precisely of its tensorial counterpart introduced by Klebanov and

case $G=U(N)$, we introduce an intermediate field representation and perform a
stability analysis of the vacua. It turns out that the only apparently viable
combination of couplings that avoids mass generation corresponds to an unstable
vacuum. The stable vacuum breaks $U(N)^3$ invariance, in contradiction with the

process of nucleation, a thermally activated phase transition that typically
occurs at atomistic scales. The numerical modeling of this process is
problematic for traditional numerical techniques: commonly used phase-field
methods' resolution does not extend to the atomic scales at which nucleation
takes places, while atomistic methods such as molecular dynamics are incapable
of scaling to the mesoscale regime where late-stage growth and structure
formation takes place following earlier nucleation. Consequently, it is of
interest to examine nucleation in the more recently proposed phase-field
crystal (PFC) model, which attempts to bridge the atomic and mesoscale regimes
in microstructure simulations. In this work, we numerically calculate
homogeneous liquid-to-solid nucleation rates and incubation times in the
simplest version of the PFC model, for various parameter choices. We show that
the model naturally exhibits qualitative agreement with the predictions of
classical nucleation theory (CNT) despite a lack of some explicit atomistic
features presumed in CNT. We also examine the early appearance of lattice
structure in nucleating grains, finding disagreement with some basic
assumptions of CNT. We then argue that a quantitatively correct nucleation
theory for the PFC model would require extending CNT to a multi-variable
theory.

the dynamics of system observables; Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD)
is a data-driven method for approximating the Koopman operator using functions
(features) of the system state snapshots. This paper investigates an approach
to EDMD in which the features used provide random approximations to a
particular kernel function. The objective of this is computational economy for
large data sets: EDMD is generally ill-suited for problems with large state
dimension, and its dual kernel formulation (KDMD) is well-suited for such
problems only if the number of data snapshots is relatively small. We discuss
two specific methods for generating features: random Fourier features, and the
Nystrom method. The first method is a data-independent method for
translation-invariant kernels only and involves random sampling in feature
space; the second method is a data-dependent empirical method that may be used
for any kernel and involves random sampling of data. We first discuss how these
ideas may be applied in an EDMD context, as well as a means for adaptively
adding random Fourier features. We demonstrate these methods on two example
problems and conclude with an analysis of the relative benefits and drawbacks
of each method.

measuring overall metallicity and rely on astrophysical abundance correlations

equivalent widths of multiple Fe I and Ti I lines and a temperature-sensitive
index based on the FeH bandhead. We used abundances measured from
widely-separated solar-type companions to empirically calibrate transformations
to the observed indices and equivalent widths that force agreement with the

results refute the claim of strong evidence for a centrally concentrated pulsar

properties of their progenitors are largely unknown in spite of many attempts
to determine them using the event rate, duration and energetics. Understanding
the radiation mechanism for FRBs should provide the missing insights regarding
their progenitors, which is investigated in this paper. The high brightness
temperatures (>10^{35} K) of FRBs mean that the emission process must be
coherent. Two general classes of coherent radiation mechanisms are considered
--- maser and the antenna mechanism. We use the observed properties of the
repeater FRB 121102 to constrain the plasma conditions needed for these two
mechanisms. We have looked into a wide variety of maser mechanisms operating in
either vacuum or plasma and find that none of them can explain the high
luminosity of FRBs without invoking unrealistic or fine-tuned plasma
conditions. The most favorable mechanism is antenna curvature emission by
coherent charge bunches where the burst is powered by magnetic reconnection
near the surface of a magnetar (B > 10^{14} G). We show that the plasma in the
twisted magnetosphere of a magnetar may be clumpy due to two-stream
instability. When magnetic reconnection occurs, the pre-existing density clumps
may provide charge bunches for the antenna mechanism to operate. This model
should be applicable to all FRBs that have multiple outbursts like FRB 121102.

Using a 2D, two-component decomposition of Lya emission assuming circular
exponential distributions, we measure scale lengths and luminosities of Lya
haloes. We find that 80% of our objects having reliable Lya halo measurements
show Lya emission that is significantly more extended than the UV continuum
detected by HST (by a factor ~4 to >20). The median exponential scale length of
the Lya haloes in our sample is ~4.5 kpc. By comparing the maximal detected
extent of the Lya emission with the predicted dark matter halo virial radii of
simulated galaxies, we show that the detected Lya emission of our selected
sample of LAEs probes a significant portion of the cold circum-galactic medium
(CGM) of these galaxies (>50% in average). This result shows that there must be
significant HI reservoirs in the CGM and reinforces the idea that Lya haloes
are ubiquitous around high-redshift Lya emitting galaxies. Our characterization
of the Lya haloes indicates that the majority of the Lya flux comes from the
halo (~65%) and that their scale lengths seem to be linked to the UV properties
of the galaxies. We do not observe a significant Lya halo size evolution with
redshift. We also find that the Lya lines cover a large range of full width at
half maximum (FWHM) from 118 to 512 km/s. While the FWHM does not seem to be
correlated to the Lya scale length, most compact Lya haloes and those that are
not detected with high significance tend to have narrower Lya profiles.
Finally, we investigate the origin of the extended Lya emission but we conclude
that our data do not allow us to disentangle the possible processes.

electron-phonon and electron-impurity interactions within the Random Phase
Approximation, we demonstrate that monolayer and bilayer graphene both host two
different hydrodynamic regimes. We predict that the hydrodynamic window in
bilayer graphene is stronger than in monolayer graphene, and has a
characteristic `v-shape' as opposed to a `lung-shape'. Finally, we collapse
experimental data onto a universal disorder-limited theory, thereby proving
that the observed violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in monolayers occurs in a
regime dominated by impurity-induced electron-hole puddles.

recover accurate pulsation frequencies for K2 signals that reflected 4-5 times
off the Nyquist with the full precision of over 70 days of monitoring (~0.01
muHz). In turn, the K2 observations enable us to select the correct peaks from
the alias structure of the ground-based signals caused by gaps in the
observations. We identify at least seven independent pulsation modes in the
light curves of each of these stars. For EPIC 220274129, we detect three
complete sets of rotationally split ell=1 (dipole mode) triplets, which we use

the observing setup we simulated, the Bayesian Information Criterion, without
model averaging, is the best way for identifying the correct model and for
estimating its parameters. Sources can only be identified correctly if their
parameters lie inside a 'Goldilocks region': strong depolarization makes it
impossible to detect sources that emit over a wide range in RM, whereas sources
that emit over a narrow range in RM cannot be told apart from simpler sources
or sources that emit at only one RM. We identify when emission at similar RMs
is 'resolved', and quantify this in a way similar to the Rayleigh criterion in
optics. Also, we identify pitfalls in RM synthesis that are avoided by QU
fitting. Finally, we show how channel weights can be tweaked to produce
apodized RM spectra, that observing time requirements in RM synthesis and QU
fitting are the same, and we analyse when to stop RMClean.

the dust mass (Mdust), the dust temperature (Tdust), and the mid-to-total
infrared color (IR8=LIR/L8). The latter measures the relative contribution of
PAH molecules to the LIR. We used this library to model star-forming galaxies
at 0.5<z<4 in the CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks
of Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z=0 using the
Herschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust SED of a galaxy was found
independent of stellar mass, but evolving with redshift. We found trends of
increasing Tdust and IR8 with redshift and distance from the SFR--Mstar main
sequence (MS), and quantified for the first time their intrinsic scatter. Half
of the observed variation of these parameters was captured by these empirical
relations, with residual scatters of 12% and 0.18 dex, respectively. Second
order variations with stellar mass are discussed. Building on these results, we
constructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the accuracy of LIR
and Mdust determined from a single flux measurement. Using a single JWST MIRI
band, we found that LIR is typically uncertain by 0.15 dex, with a maximum of
0.25 dex when probing the rest-frame 8 um, and this is not significantly
impacted by typical redshift uncertainties. On the other hand, we found that
ALMA bands 8-to-7 and 6-to-3 measure Mdust at better than 0.2 and 0.15 dex,
respectively, and independently of redshift, while bands 9-to-6 only measure
LIR at better than 0.2 dex at z>1, 3.2, 3.8, and 5.7, respectively. Starburst
galaxies above the MS have LIR significantly underestimated and Mdust
overestimated. These results can be used immediately to interpret more
accurately the large amount of archival data from Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA.

energy scales plays crucial role for its low temperature phase, and the route
of chemical substitution has often been used to tune these different energy
scales. Here, we report an evolution of structural, magnetic and electronic
properties in doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$O$_4$ ($x$ $\leq$ 0.2). The
substitution of Cu$^{2+}$ (3$d^9$) for Ir$^{4+}$ (5$d^5$) acts for electron
doping, though it tunes the related parameters such as, spin-orbit coupling,
electron correlation and Ir charge state. Moreover, both Ir$^{4+}$ and
Cu$^{2+}$ has single unpaired spin though it occupies different $d$-orbitals.
With Cu substitution, system retains its original structural symmetry but the
structural parameters show systematic changes. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
measurements show Ir$^{4+}$ equivalently converts to Ir$^{5+}$ and a
significant enhancement in the density of states has been observed at the Fermi
level due to the contribution from the Cu 3$d$ orbitals, which supports the
observed decrease in the resistivity with Cu substitution. While the long-range
magnetic ordering is much weakened and the highest doped sample shows almost
paramagnetic-like behavior the overall system remains insulator. Analysis of
resistivity data shows mode of charge conduction in whole series follows
2-dimensional variable-range-hopping model but the range of validity varies
with temperature. Whole series of samples exhibit negative magnetoresistance at
low temperature which is considered to be a signature of weak localization
effect in spin-orbit coupled system, and its evolution with Cu appears to
follow the variation of resistivity with $x$.

Henon-Heiles system. By reducing the stiffness of one low-frequency vibrational
mode, a faster relaxation is enabeled. This is due to a reduction of the energy
barrier heights along the softened normal mode as well as for a widening of the
opening channels of the energy landscape in configurational space. The
relaxation is for the most part exponential, and can be explained by a simple
flux equation. Yet, for some initial conditions the relaxation follows as a
power law and, and in many cases, there is a regime change from exponential to
power law decay. We pin point the initial conditions for the power law decay,
finding two regions of sticky states. For such states, quasiperiodic orbits are
found since almost for all components of the initial momentum orientation, the
system is trapped inside two pockets of configurational space. The softened

rays. With its observations over 2/3 of the sky every day, the HAWC observatory
is sensitive to a wide variety of astrophysical sources, including possible
gamma rays from dark matter. Dark matter annihilation and decay in the Milky
Way Galaxy should produce gamma-ray signals across many degrees on the sky. The
HAWC instantaneous field-of-view of 2 sr enables observations of extended
regions on the sky, such as those from dark matter in the Galactic halo. Here
we show limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section and decay lifetime
from HAWC observations of the Galactic halo with 15 months of data. These are
some of the most robust limits on TeV and PeV dark matter, largely insensitive
to the dark matter morphology. These limits begin to constrain models in which
PeV IceCube neutrinos are explained by dark matter which primarily decays into
hadrons.

Interestingly, we find that describing a complete NoC comprising router
submodules faces fundamental difficulties not present in describing the routers

router and NoC modules that are exact cycle- and bit-accurate replacements of
our reference RTL-based router and NoC modules. Furthermore, the routers and

and droplets, are known to self-organize into ordered structures at fluid-solid
boundaries. The entrainment of particles in the attractive parts of their
spontaneous flows has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying this
phenomenon. Here, combining experiments, theory and numerical simulations, we
demonstrate the validity of this flow-induced ordering mechanism in a
suspension of active emulsion droplets. We show that the mechanism can be
controlled, with a variety of resultant ordered structures, by simply altering
hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Thus, for flow in Hele-Shaw cells, metastable
lines or stable traveling bands can be obtained by varying the cell height.
Similarly, for flow bounded by a plane, dynamic crystallites are formed. At a
no-slip wall the crystallites are characterised by a continuous out-of-plane
flux of particles that circulate and re-enter at the crystallite edges, thereby
stabilising them. At an interface where the tangential stress vanishes the
crystallites are strictly two-dimensional, with no out-of-plane flux. We
rationalize these experimental results by calculating, in each case, the slow
viscous flow produced by the droplets and the dissipative, long-ranged,
many-body active forces and torques between them. The results of numerical
simulations of motion under the action of the active forces and torques are in
excellent agreement with experiments. Our work elucidates the mechanism of
flow-induced phase separation (FIPS) in active fluids, particularly active
colloidal suspensions, and demonstrates its control by boundaries, suggesting
new routes to geometric and topological phenomena in active matter.

consistent perturbative framework for describing the statistical distribution
of cosmological large-scale structure. In a previous EFTofLSS calculation that
involved the one-loop power spectra and tree-level bispectra, it was shown that
the $k$-reach of the prediction for biased tracers is comparable for all
investigated masses if suitable higher-derivative biases, which are less
suppressed for more massive tracers, are added. However, it is possible that
the non-linear biases grow faster with tracer mass than the linear bias,
implying that loop contributions could be the leading correction to the
bispectra. To check this, we include the one-loop contributions in a fit to
numerical data in the limit of strongly enhanced higher-order biases. We show
that the resulting one-loop power spectra and higher-derivative plus leading
one-loop bispectra fit the two- and three-point functions respectively up to
$k\simeq 0.19\ h\ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k\simeq 0.14\ h\ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at the
percent level. We find that the higher-order bias coefficients are not strongly
enhanced, and we argue that the gain in perturbative reach due to the leading
one-loop contributions to the bispectra is relatively small. Thus, we conclude
that higher-derivative biases provide the leading correction to the bispectra
for tracers of a very wide range of masses.

to both the <100> and <110> basal plane directions. Measurements at high field
were made possible by the use of both spin polarization and analysis to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. Rotating the field towards the basal plane causes a
distortion of the square vortex lattice observed for H // <001>, and also a
symmetry change to a distorted triangular symmetry for fields close to <100>.
The vortex lattice distortion allows us to determine the intrinsic
superconducting anisotropy between the c-axis and the Ru-O basal plane,
yielding a value of ~60 at low temperature and low to intermediate fields. This
greatly exceeds the upper critical field anisotropy of ~20 at low temperature,
reminiscent of Pauli limiting. Indirect evidence for Pauli paramagnetic effects
on the unpaired quasiparticles in the vortex cores are observed, but a direct
detection lies below the measurement sensitivity. The superconducting
anisotropy is found to be independent of temperature but increases for fields >
1 T, indicating multiband superconductvity in Sr2RuO4. Finally, the temperature

exploiting their infinite data generation potential. Results show that using
even the simplest form of self-training yields an improvement. We also show
results for a more complex self-training scheme that performs at least as well
as the basic self-training scheme but with significantly less data
augmentation.

distributed storage systems transitioning to erasure coding based schemes.
Local Reconstruction Codes (LRCs) have emerged as the codes of choice for these
applications. These codes can correct a small number of erasures by accessing
only a small number of remaining coordinates. An $(n,r,h,a,q)$-LRC is a linear
code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of length $n$, whose codeword symbols are partitioned
into $g=n/r$ local groups each of size $r$. It has $h$ global parity checks and
each local group has $a$ local parity checks. Such an LRC is Maximally
Recoverable (MR), if it corrects all erasure patterns which are
information-theoretically correctable under the stipulated structure of local
and global parity checks.
  We show the first non-trivial lower bounds on the field size required for MR
LRCs. When $a,h$ are constant and the number of local groups $g \ge h$, while
$r$ may grow with $n$, our lower bound simplifies to $q\ge
\Omega_{a,h}\left(n\cdot r^{\min\{a,h-2\}}\right).$ No superlinear (in $n$)
lower bounds were known prior to this work for any setting of parameters.
  MR LRCs deployed in practice have a small number of global parities,
typically $h=2,3$. We complement our lower bounds by giving constructions with
small field size for $h\le 3$. For $h=2$, we give a linear field size
construction. We also show a surprising application of elliptic curves and
arithmetic progression free sets in the construction of MR LRCs.

parameters, we have simulated PSP encounters with a fully three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a CH jet. We find that three internal jet
regions, featuring different wave modes and levels of compressibility, have
distinct identifying signatures detectable by PSP. The leading Alfv\'{e}n wave
front and its immediate wake are characterized by trans-Alfv\'{e}nic plasma
flows with mild density enhancements. This front exhibits characteristics of a
fast switch-on MHD shock, whose arrival is signaled by the sudden onset of
large-amplitude transverse velocity and magnetic-field oscillations highly
correlated in space and time. The trailing portion is characterized by
supersonic but sub-Alfv\'{e}nic outflows of dense plasma with uncorrelated
velocity and magnetic-field oscillations. This compressible region contains
most of the jet's mass. The volume between the immediate wake and dense jet,
the remote wake, mixes and transitions the characteristics of the two other
regions. In addition to probing each region separately, we also simulate a
co-rotational PSP-jet encounter. In this scenario, the simulated spacecraft
hovers over the jet-producing CH, as may occur during the mission's
co-rotational phases, sampling each jet region in turn. We estimate that PSP
will encounter numerous CH jets over the lifetime of the mission.

In particular, we conjecture and empirically illustrate that, the celebrated
batch normalization (BN) technique actually adapts the normalized bias such
that it approximates the rightful bias induced by the generalized hamming
distance. Once the due bias is enforced analytically, neither the optimization
of bias terms nor the sophisticated batch normalization is needed. Also in the
light of generalized hamming distance, the popular rectified linear units
(ReLU) can be treated as setting a minimal hamming distance threshold between
network inputs and weights. This thresholding scheme, on the one hand, can be
improved by introducing double thresholding on both extremes of neuron outputs.
On the other hand, ReLUs turn out to be non-essential and can be removed from
networks trained for simple tasks like MNIST classification. The proposed
generalized hamming network (GHN) as such not only lends itself to rigorous
analysis and interpretation within the fuzzy logic theory but also demonstrates
fast learning speed, well-controlled behaviour and state-of-the-art

strings that behave like infinitely thin solenoids. Despite decades of
searches, free magnetic monopoles and their Dirac strings have eluded
experimental detection, although there is substantial evidence for deconfined
magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials. Here we report the
detection of a hierarchy of unequally-spaced magnetic excitations \emph{via}
high resolution inelastic neutron spectroscopic measurements on the quantum
spin ice candidate Pr$_{2}$Sn$_{2}$O$_{7}$. These excitations are
well-described by a simple model of monopole pairs bound by a linear potential
with an effective tension of 0.642(8) K~$\cdot$\AA$^{-1}$ at 1.65~K. The
success of the linear potential model suggests that these low energy magnetic

the object stability. However, realizing finger gaits planning in dexterous
manipulation is challenging due to the complicated grasp quality metrics,
uncertainties on object shapes and dynamics (mass and moment of inertia), and
unexpected slippage under uncertain contact dynamics. In this paper, a
dual-stage optimization based planner is proposed to handle these challenges.
In the first stage, a velocity-level finger gaits planner is introduced by
combining object grasp quality with hand manipulability. The proposed finger
gaits planner is computationally efficient and realizes finger gaiting without
3D model of the object. In the second stage, a robust manipulation controller
using robust control and force optimization is proposed to address object
dynamics uncertainties and external disturbances. The dual-stage planner is
able to guarantee stability under unexpected slippage caused by uncertain
contact dynamics. Moreover, it does not require velocity measurement or
expensive 3D/6D tactile sensors. The proposed dual-stage optimization based

cognitive decline relative to normal aging. It is of critical scientific
importance to gain a better understanding of early disease mechanisms in the
brain to facilitate effective, targeted therapies. The volume of the
hippocampus is often used in diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Measuring
this volume via neuroimaging is difficult since each hippocampus must either be
manually identified or automatically delineated, a task referred to as
segmentation. Automatic hippocampal segmentation often involves mapping a
previously manually segmented image to a new brain image and propagating the
labels to obtain an estimate of where each hippocampus is located in the new
image. A more recent approach to this problem is to propagate labels from
multiple manually segmented atlases and combine the results using a process
known as label fusion. To date, most label fusion algorithms employ voting
procedures with voting weights assigned directly or estimated via optimization.
We propose using a fully Bayesian spatial regression model for label fusion
that facilitates direct incorporation of covariate information while making
accessible the entire posterior distribution. Our results suggest that
incorporating tissue classification (e.g, gray matter) into the label fusion
procedure can greatly improve segmentation when relatively homogeneous, healthy
brains are used as atlases for diseased brains. The fully Bayesian approach
also produces meaningful uncertainty measures about hippocampal volumes,
information which can be leveraged to detect significant, scientifically
meaningful differences between healthy and diseased populations, improving the
potential for early detection and tracking of the disease.

phenomenon, which is the delocalization of $p$-polarized waves at a special
incident angle, in randomly-stratified anisotropic media are studied
theoretically for two different random models. In the first model, the random
parts of the transverse and longitudinal components of the dielectric tensor,
between which the longitudinal component is the one in the stratification
direction, are assumed to be uncorrelated, while, in the second model, they are
proportional to each other. We calculate the localization length in a precise
way using the invariant imbedding method. From analytical considerations, we
provide an interpretation of the Brewster anomaly as a phenomenon arising when
the wave impedance is effectively uniform. Similarly, the ordinary Brewster
effect is interpreted as an impedance matching phenomenon. We derive the
existence condition for the Brewster anomaly and concise analytical expressions
for the localization length, which are accurate in the weak disorder regime. We
find that the Brewster anomaly can arise only when disorder is sufficiently
weak and only in the second model with a positive ratio of the random parts.
The incident angle at which the anomaly occurs depends sensitively on the ratio
of the random parts and the average values of the tensor components. In the
cases where the critical angle of total reflection exists, the angle at which
the anomaly occurs can be either bigger or smaller than the critical angle.
When the transverse and longitudinal components are uncorrelated, localization
is dominated by the the transverse component at small incident angles. When
only the longitudinal component is random, the localization length diverges as
$\theta^{-4}$ as the incident angle $\theta$ goes to zero and is also argued to
diverge for all $\theta$ in the strong disorder limit.

number of problems and fields due to their superior performance in

implement are convolution and pooling, this type of networks is implicitly
designed to act on data described by regular structures such as images.
Motivated by the recent interest in processing signals defined in irregular
domains, we advocate a CNN architecture that operates on signals supported on
graphs. The proposed design replaces the classical convolution not with a
node-invariant graph filter (GF), which is the natural generalization of
convolution to graph domains, but with a node-varying GF. This filter extracts
different local features without increasing the output dimension of each layer
and, as a result, bypasses the need for a pooling stage while involving only
local operations. A second contribution is to replace the node-varying GF with
a hybrid node-varying GF, which is a new type of GF introduced in this paper.
While the alternative architecture can still be run locally without requiring a
pooling stage, the number of trainable parameters is smaller and can be
rendered independent of the data dimension. Tests are run on a synthetic source
localization problem and on the 20NEWS dataset.

communicate their value-policy parameters to their neighbors, diffusing the

that on a random geometric graph with self-tuning weights, Lipschitz learning
is in fact highly sensitive to the distribution of the unlabeled data, and we
show how the degree of sensitivity can be adjusted by tuning the weights. In

that for the Gaussian, $\Omega\left( \gamma^{-2} \log(p)\right)$ samples are
required from each dataset to detect change, where $\gamma$ is the smallest
ratio of off-diagonal to diagonal terms in the precision matrices of the

approach prone to sampling errors, it also leads to a covariance matrix of the
estimators that is typically bounded from below by a term that is of the order
of the inverse of the subdata size. We propose a novel approach, termed
information-based optimal subdata selection (IBOSS). Compared to leading
existing subdata methods, the IBOSS approach has the following advantages: (i)
it is significantly faster; (ii) it is suitable for distributed parallel
computing; (iii) the variances of the slope parameter estimators converge to 0
as the full data size increases even if the subdata size is fixed, i.e., the
convergence rate depends on the full data size; (iv) data analysis for IBOSS
subdata is straightforward and the sampling distribution of an IBOSS estimator

genetic association studies. Principal component analysis, as a popular
dimension reduction method, especially when the number of phenotypes is
high-dimensional, has been proposed to analyze multiple correlated phenotypes.
It has been empirically observed that the first PC, which summarizes the
largest amount of variance, can be less powerful than higher order PCs and
other commonly used methods in detecting genetic association signals. In this
paper, we investigate the properties of PCA-based multiple phenotype analysis
from a geometric perspective by introducing a novel concept called principal
angle. A particular PC is powerful if its principal angle is $0^o$ and is
powerless if its principal angle is $90^o$. Without prior knowledge about the
true principal angle, each PC can be powerless. We propose linear, non-linear
and data-adaptive omnibus tests by combining PCs. We show that the omnibus PC
test is robust and powerful in a wide range of scenarios. We study the
properties of the proposed methods using power analysis and eigen-analysis. The
subtle differences and close connections between these combined PC methods are
illustrated graphically in terms of their rejection boundaries. Our proposed
tests have convex acceptance regions and hence are admissible. The $p$-values
for the proposed tests can be efficiently calculated analytically and the
proposed tests have been implemented in a publicly available R package {\it
MPAT}. We conduct simulation studies in both low and high dimensional settings
with various signal vectors and correlation structures. We apply the proposed
tests to the joint analysis of metabolic syndrome related phenotypes with data
sets collected from four international consortia to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed combined PC testing procedures.

high-performance communication between UAVs and their ground clients,
especially when they are densely deployed. To achieve this goal, cellular base
stations (BSs) can be leveraged to provide a new and promising solution to
support massive UAV communications simultaneously in a cost-effective way.
However, different from terrestrial communication channels, UAV-to-BS channels
are usually dominated by the light-of-sight (LoS) link, which aggravates the
co-channel interference and renders the spatial frequency reuse in existing
cellular networks ineffective. In this paper, we consider the use of a
directional antenna at each UAV to confine the interference to/from other UAV
users within a limited region and hence improve the spatial reuse of the
spectrum. Under this model, a UAV user may be temporarily blocked from
communication if it cannot find any BS in its antenna main-lobe, or it finds
that all BSs under its main-lobe are simultaneously covered by those of some
other UAVs and hence suffer from strong co-channel interference. Assuming
independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs) for the UAVs' and
ground BSs' locations respectively, we first analytically derive a closed-form
upper bound for the UAV blocking probability and then characterize the
achievable average spatial throughput of the cellular-enabled UAV communication
network, in terms of various key parameters including the BS/UAV densities as
well as the UAV's flying altitude and antenna beamwidth. Simulation results
verify that the derived bound is practically tight, and further show that
adaptively adjusting the UAV altitude and/or beamwidth with different BS/UAV
densities can significantly reduce the UAV blocking probability and hence
improve the network spatial throughput.

Schwarzschild radius for a density not much higher than the Planck scale, and
the proper distance from its surface to the origin can be very short even for

framework of the dyadic wavelet is extended to more generic rational wavelet
design, where dyadic is a special case and 2) the proposed work allows to learn
rational wavelet transform from a given signal and does not require large

spherical harmonic analysis. The spring model explained the vertical
deformation of the drop, however, could not completely explain the energy loss,
the timings of the energy loss did not match. From a viewpoint of the spherical
harmonic deformation of a drop, the deformation of the drop after the impact
was found to be a combination of two vibrational motions. One of the two
vibrational motions is an inertial motion derived from the free-fall and the
another is a pressure-induced motion derived from a pressure surge due to the
sudden stop of the bottom part of the drop at the impact. The existence of the
pressure surge at the impact was confirmed in the simulated results. The
pressure-induced motion resists the inertial motion and consequently dumps the
kinetic energy of the drop.

sensitivity and the QBA. Here we consider the measurement of motion of a free
mass performed in a quantum reference frame with an effective negative mass
which is not limited by QBA. As a result, the disturbance on the motion of a
free mass can be measured beyond SQL. QBA-limited detection of motion for a
free mass is extremely challenging, but there are devices where this effect is
expected to play an essential role, namely, gravitational wave detectors (GWD)
such as LIGO and VIRGO. Recent reports on observation of gravitational waves
have opened new horizons in cosmology and astrophysics. Here we present a
general idea and a detailed numerical analysis for QBA-evading measurement of
the gravitational wave effect on the GWD mirrors which can be considered free
masses under relevant conditions. The measurement is performed by two entangled
beams of light probing the GWD and an auxiliary atomic spin ensemble,
respectively. The latter plays a role of a free negative mass. We show that
under realistic conditions the sensitivity of the GWD can be significantly

capture fluid-fluid interfaces in two-phase flows. The two phases are modeled
by the phase-field finite element formulation, which involves the conservative
Allen-Cahn equation coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The positivity preserving variational formulation is designed to maintain the
bounded and stable solution of the Allen-Cahn equation. For the adaptivity
procedure, we consider the residual-based error estimates for the underlying
differential equations of the two-phase system. In particular, the adaptive
refinement/coarsening is carried out by the newest vertex bisection algorithm
by evaluating the residual error indicators based on the error estimates of the
Allen-Cahn equation. The coarsening algorithm avoids the storage of the tree
data structures for the hierarchical mesh, thus providing the ease of numerical
implementation. The proposed nonlinear adaptive partitioned procedure aims at
reducing the amount of coarsening while maintaining the convergence properties
of the underlying nonlinear coupled differential equations. We investigate the
adaptive phase-field finite element scheme through the spinodal decomposition
in a complex curved geometry and the volume-conserved interface motion driven
by the mean curvature flow for two circles in a square domain. We then assess
the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed procedure by modeling the
free-surface motion in a sloshing tank. The mesh adaptivity remarkably reduces
the degrees of freedom and the computational cost by nearly half for similar
accuracy and improves the mass conservation. Finally, we apply the adaptive
numerical framework to solve the application of a dam-breaking problem with
topological changes.

physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this work we discuss how the
behaviour of the model at high energy scales causes it to have a scalar with
properties very similar to those of the SM -- which means the 2HDM can be seen
to naturally favor a decoupling or alignment limit. For a type II 2HDM, we show
that requiring the model to be theoretically valid up to a scale of 1 TeV, by
studying the renormalization group equations (RGE) of the parameters of the
model, causes a significant reduction in the allowed magnitude of the quartic
couplings. This, combined with $B$-physics bounds, forces the model to be
naturally decoupled. As a consequence, any non-decoupling limits in type II,
like the wrong-sign scenario, are excluded. On the contrary, even with the very
constraining limits for the Higgs couplings from the LHC, the type I model can
deviate substantially from alignment. An RGE analysis similar to that made for
type II shows, however, that requiring a single scalar to be heavier than about
500 GeV would be sufficient for the model to be decoupled. Finally, we show
that not only a 2HDM where the lightest of the CP-even scalars is the 125 GeV
one does not require new physics to be stable up to the Planck scale but this
is also true when the heavy CP-even Higgs is the 125 GeV and the theory has no
decoupling limit for the type I model.

research, direct application of Sobel edge detection algorithm or applying

a universal eye which drastically increases the probability of tracing a

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the uplink pilot overhead in a time division duplexing
(TDD) massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) mobile systems. A common
scenario of conventional massive MIMO systems is a Base Station (BS) serving
all user terminals (UTs) in the cell with the same TDD frame format that fits
the coherence interval of the worst-case scenario of user mobility (e.g. a
moving train with velocity 300 Km/s). Furthermore, the BS has to estimate all
the channels each time-slot for all users even for those with long coherence
intervals. In fact, within the same cell, sensors or pedestrian with low
mobility UTs (e.g. moving 1.38 m/s) share the same short TDD frame and thus are
obliged to upload their pilots each time-slot. The channel coherence interval
of the pedestrian UTs with a carrier frequency of 1.9 GHz can be as long as 60
times that of the train passenger users. In other words, conventional
techniques waste 59-uploaded pilot sequences for channel estimation. In this
paper, we are aware of the resources waste due to various coherence intervals
among different user mobility. We classify users based on their coherence
interval length, and we propose to skip uploading pilots of UTs with large
coherence intervals. Then, we shift frames with the same pilot reused sequence
toward an empty pilot time-slot. Simulation results had proved that the
proposed technique overcome the performance of conventional massive MIMO
systems in both energy and spectral efficiency.

was particularly pronounced in field cooling (FC) experiments, i.e. after
abrupt cooling of the sample in the external magnetic field at the temperature
T less Tc with subsequent slow warming up to room temperature with invariance
of applied field. The attenuation peak height depended on the preliminary
orientation (before cooling) of the samples in the measured permanent magnetic
field H. On the one hand, it is well khow that, after the FC procedure and
subsequent slow warming up, at the temperatures close to the critical
temperature Tc, the attenuation peak associated with ""melting"" of the Abrikosov
frozen vortex structure and its disappearance at T more Tc is detected in
monophase samples. At the same time, in most multiphase bismuth HTSC samples,
synthesized using solar energy and superfast quenching of the melt, the
attenuation peak with the maximum at T=200K was observed. Depending on the
conditions of synthesis, the attenuation peak could be two-humped and could be
located in the temperature range much wider than Tc of the major
superconducting phase. We assume that this is due to the existence of frozen
magnetic fluxes (after FC) in superconducting ""dropping"" regions, which
gradually (with increasing temperature) transfer into the normal state and
release pinned vortex threads. This fact could be a sause of observed
dissipative processes, so as also the evidence of the existence of

point-like particles. Moreover, they serve as the simple sources of the
gravitational fields both in General Relativity and much more complex quadratic
gravity theories. We are interested in the special and physically important
case when all the quadratic in curvature tensor (Riemann tensor) and its
contractions (Ricci tensor and scalar curvature) terms are present in the form
of the square of Weyl tensor. By definition, the energy-momentum tensor of the
thin shell is proportional to Dirac delta-function. We constructed the theory
of the spherically symmetric thin shells for three types of gravitational
theories with the shell: (1) General Relativity; (2) Pure conformal (Weyl)
gravity where the gravitational part of the total Lagrangian is just the square
of the Weyl tensor; (3) Weyl+Einstein gravity. The results are compared with
these in General Relativity (Israel equations). We considered in details the
shells immersed in the vacuum. Some peculiar properties of such shells are
found. In particular, for the traceless (= massless) shells it is shown that
their dynamics can not be derived from the matching conditions and, thus, is
completely arbitrary. On the contrary, in the case of the Weyl+Einstein gravity
the trajectory of the same type of shell is completely restored even without
knowledge of the outside solution.

earthquake signals for comparison so that the convexity of the misfit function

the attractive interactions between two layers leads to the BCS-BEC crossover.
Here, using the BCS mean field theory, we study such a crossover in symmetric
bilayers of ultracold dipolar fermions with their dipole moments being
perpendicular to layers. In particular, we investigate how the pairing between
two layers and the many-body screening of interlayer interaction affect each
other. We compare results for pairings obtained with three different
approximations for the interlayer interactions namely, bare dipole-dipole
interaction, the random-phase approximation for screening obtained in the
normal phase, and the self-consistent superfluid phase screening within the
random-phase approximation. We find that at weak couplings the screening
further suppresses the pairing while at strong couplings, the screening would
be suppressed due to the pairing gap in the quasi-particle spectrum. Therefore
a self-consistent treatment of both screening and pairing on equal footings is
necessary for obtaining a correct picture of the phase diagram and order
parameter at both small and large layer spacings and densities. We also notice
that the highly speculated density-wave instability in bilayers with the
parallel polarization of dipoles in two layers is simply an artifact of the
incorrect screening scheme.

polynomial expansion of a shift operation,that is, the Z-transform
representation. When extended to graph signal processing (GSP), this would mean
that a shift-invariant graph filter can be represented as a polynomial of the
adjacency (shift) matrix of the graph. However, the characteristic and minimum
polynomials of the adjacency matrix must be identical for the property to hold.
While it has been suggested that this condition might be ignored as it is
always possible to find a polynomial transform to represent the original
adjacency matrix by another adjacency matrix that satisfies the condition, this
letter shows that a filter that is shift invariant in terms of the original
graph may not be shift invariant anymore under the modified graph and vice
versa. We introduce the notion of ""shift-enabled graph"" for graphs that satisfy
the aforementioned condition, and present a concrete example of a graph that is
not ""shift-enabled"" and a shift-invariant filter that is not a polynomial of
the shift operation matrix. The result provides a deeper understanding of
shift-invariant filters when applied in GSP and shows that further
investigation of shift-enabled graphs is needed to make it applicable to
practical scenarios.

amplitude under the implementation architecture constraint, and the average
transmission power over the total K time slots taking for synchronization
should be constant for any spatial direction. Then, we derive the optimal
synchronization detector based on generalized likelihood ratio test. By
utilizing this detector, we analyze the effect of the precoding and combining

should guarantee the perfect omnidirectional coverage at each time slot, i.e.,
the average transmission power at each time slot is constant for any spatial

omnidirectional combining matrices exist only when both of the number of
transmit streams and the number of receive streams are equal to or greater than

design of a chip from reverse engineering. However, recent work has shown that
even camouflaged ICs can be reverse engineered from the observed input/output
behaviour of a chip using SAT solvers. However, these so-called SAT attacks
have so far targeted only camouflaged combinational circuits. For camouflaged
sequential circuits, the SAT attack requires that the internal state of the
circuit is controllable and observable via the scan chain. It has been
implicitly assumed that restricting scan chain access increases the security of
camouflaged ICs from reverse engineering attacks. In this paper, we develop a
new attack methodology to decamouflage sequential circuits without scan access.
Our attack uses a model checker (a more powerful reasoning tool than a SAT
solver) to find a discriminating set of input sequences, i.e., one that is
sufficient to determine the functionality of camouflaged gates. We propose
several refinements, including the use of a bounded model checker, and
sufficient conditions for determining when a set of input sequences is
discriminating to improve the run-time and scalabilty of our attack. Our attack
is able to decamouflage a large sequential benchmark circuit that implements a

sine-Gordon equation in nonpotential form and its nonlocal forms. A reduction
technique for solutions is employed, by which exact solutions in double
Wronskian form are obtained for these reduced equations from those double
Wronskian solutions of the AKNS hierarchy. As examples of dynamics we
illustrate new interaction of two-soliton solutions of the reverse-$t$
nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation. Although as a single soliton it is always
stationary, two solitons travel along completely symmetric trajectories in
$\{x,t\}$ plane and their amplitudes are affected by phase parameters.
Asymptotic analysis is given as demonstration. The approach and relation
described in this paper are systematic and general and can be used to other
nonlocal equations.

the original Newton duality to more general potentials, including general
polynomial potentials and transcendental-function potentials, 2) constructing a
quantum version of the Newton duality, including power potentials, general
polynomial potentials, transcendental-function potentials, and power potentials
in different spatial dimensions, and 3) suggesting a method for solving
eigenproblems in quantum mechanics based on the quantum Newton duality provided
in the paper. The classical Newton duality is a duality among orbits of
classical dynamical systems. Our result shows that the Newton duality is not
only limited to power potentials, but a more universal duality relation among
dynamical systems with various potentials. The key task of this paper is to
construct a quantum Newton duality, the quantum version of the classical Newton
duality. The quantum Newton duality provides a duality relations among wave
functions and eigenvalues. As applications, we suggest a method for solving
potentials from their Newtonianly dual potential: once the solution of a
potential is known, the solution of all its dual potentials can be obtained by
the duality transformation directly. Using this method, we obtain a series of
exact solutions of various potentials. In appendices, as preparations, we solve
the potentials which is solved by the Newton duality method in this paper by

a distribution that can be observed experimentally, containing spatial
information projected from the total wave function. These density distributions
can be though as probability distributions subject to the scrutiny of the
analytical methods of information theory, namely, entropy measures, quantifiers
for the complexity, or entanglement measures. Although the classification of
resonant doubly excited states of He-like atoms in terms of labels of
approximate quantum numbers have not been exempt from controversies, a well
known proposal follows after the works by Herrick and Sinanoglu and Lin, with a
labeling based on K, T, and A numbers for the Rydberg series of increasing n2
and for a given ionization He+ (N = n1). In this work we intend to justify this
kind of classification from the topological analysis of the one-particle \rho
(r) and two-particle \r{ho}(r1,r2) density distributions of the localized part
of the resonances (computed with a Feshbach projection formalism and
configuration interaction wave functions in terms of B-splines bases), using
global quantifiers (Shannon) as well as local ones (Fisher information). We
also studied measures for the entanglement using the von Neumann and linear
entropies computed from the reduced one-particle density matrix within our
correlated configuration interaction approach. We find in this study that
global measures like the Shannon entropy hardly distinguishes among resonances
in the whole Rydberg series. On the contrary, measures like the Fisher
information, von Neumann and linear entropies are able to qualitatively
discriminate the resonances, grouping them according to their (K, T)A labels.

instability. Numerous previous experiments and numerical simulations have shown
a significant increase in the pull-in time under DC voltages close to the
pull-in voltage. Here the transient dynamics slow down as the device passes
through a meta-stable or bottleneck phase, but this slowing down is not well
understood quantitatively. Using a lumped parallel-plate model, we perform a
detailed analysis of the pull-in dynamics in this regime. We show that the
bottleneck phenomenon is a type of critical slowing down arising from the
pull-in transition. This allows us to show that the pull-in time obeys an
inverse square-root scaling law as the transition is approached; moreover we
determine an analytical expression for this pull-in time. We then compare our
prediction to a wide range of pull-in time data reported in the literature,
showing that the observed slowing down is well captured by our scaling law,
which appears to be generic for overdamped pull-in under DC loads. This
realization provides a useful design rule with which to tune dynamic response
in applications, including state-of-the-art accelerometers and pressure sensors
that use pull-in time as a sensing mechanism. We also propose a method to
estimate the pull-in voltage based only on data of the pull-in times.

scalar field with a quartic self-interaction in an infinite homogeneous static
background. This quantum relativistic Jeans problem provides a simplified
framework to study the formation of the large-scale structures of the Universe
in the case where dark matter is made of a scalar field. The scalar field may
represent the wave function of a relativistic self-gravitating Bose-Einstein
condensate. Exact analytical expressions for the dispersion relation and Jeans
length $\lambda_J$ are obtained from a hydrodynamical representation of the
Klein-Gordon-Einstein equations. When relativistic effects are fully accounted
for, we find that the perturbations are stabilized at very large scales of the
order of the Hubble length $\lambda_H$. Numerical applications are made for
ultralight bosons without self-interaction (fuzzy dark matter), for bosons with
a repulsive self-interaction, and for bosons with an attractive
self-interaction (QCD axions and ultralight axions). We show that the Jeans
instability is inhibited in the ultrarelativistic regime (early Universe and
radiationlike era) because the Jeans length is of the order of the Hubble
length ($\lambda_J\sim\lambda_H$), except when the self-interaction of the
bosons is attractive. By contrast, structure formation can take place in the
nonrelativistic regime (matterlike era) for $\lambda_J\le \lambda\le
\lambda_H$. Since the scalar field has a nonzero Jeans length due to its
quantum nature (Heisenberg uncertainty principle or quantum pressure due to the
self-interaction of the bosons), it appears that the wave properties of the
scalar field can stabilize gravitational collapse at small scales, providing
halo cores and suppressing small-scale linear power. This may solve the CDM
crisis such as the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem.

subject of intense interest, with profound implications for both the normal and
the SC states. Different experimental probes have led to vastly disparate
conclusions on the temperature range of superconducting fluctuations. The main
challenges have been to separate the SC response from complex normal-state
behavior, and to distinguish the underlying behavior of the quintessential
CuO$_{2}$ layers from compound-specific properties. Here we reveal remarkably
simple and universal behavior of the SC precursor using torque magnetometry, a
unique thermodynamic probe with extremely high sensitivity to SC diamagnetism.
We comprehensively study four distinct cuprate compounds:
single-CuO$_{2}$-layer La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO),
Bi$_{2}$(Sr,La)$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Bi2201) and HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Hg1201), and double-layer
Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{0.95}$Y$_{0.05}$CuO$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212). Our approach,
which focuses on the nonlinear diamagnetic response, completely removes
normal-state contributions and thus allows us to trace the diamagnetic signal
above Tc with great precision. We find that SC diamagnetism vanishes in an
unusual, yet surprisingly simple exponential manner, marked by a universal
temperature scale that is independent of compound and Tc. We discuss the
distinct possibility that this unusual behavior signifies the proliferation of
SC clusters as a result of the intrinsic inhomogeneity known to be an inherent
property of the cuprates.

separation using a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) and deep learning

is demonstrated with a series of patient studies and accuracy of predicted
quantitative values is analyzed.
  Methods: Water-fat separation of 1200 gradient-echo acquisitions from 90
imaging sessions (normal, acute and chronic myocardial infarction) was
performed using a conventional model based method with modeling of R2* and
off-resonance and a multi-peak fat spectrum. A U-Net convolutional neural
network for calculation of water-only, fat-only, R2* and off-resonance images
was trained with 900 gradient-echo Multiple and single-echo complex and

extended echo modeling.
  Results: The U-Net ConvNet was easily trained and provided water-fat
separation results visually comparable to conventional methods. Myocardial fat
deposition in chronic myocardial infarction and intramyocardial hemorrhage in
acute myocardial infarction were well visualized in the DL results. Predicted
values for R2*, off-resonance, water and fat signal intensities were well
correlated with conventional model based water fat separation (R2>=0.97,
p<0.001). DL images had a 14% higher signal-to-noise ratio (p<0.001) when
compared to the conventional method.
  Conclusion: Deep learning utilizing ConvNets is a feasible method for MR
water-fat separationimaging with complex, magnitude and single echo image data.
A trained U-Net can be efficiently used for MR water-fat separation, providing
results comparable to conventional model based methods.
