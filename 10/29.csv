bounds on the value function for utility maximization under the Heston
stochastic volatility model with general utility functions. It is well known
there is a closed form solution of the HJB equation for power utility due to
its homothetic property. It is not possible to get closed form solution for
general utilities and there is little literature on the numerical scheme to
solve the HJB equation for the Heston model. In this paper we propose an
efficient dual control Monte Carlo method for computing tight lower and upper
bounds of the value function. We identify a particular form of the dual control
which leads to the closed form upper bound for a class of utility functions,
including power, non-HARA and Yarri utilities. Finally, we perform some
numerical tests to see the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the method.
The numerical results support strongly our proposed scheme.

learn the value range of outliers incrementally during the process of particle
filtering. The learned range of outliers is then used to improve subsequent
filtering of the future state. Convergence of the outlier range estimation
procedure is indicated by extensive empirical simulations using a set of
differing outlier distribution models. The validity of the ILAPF algorithm is
evaluated by illustrative simulations, and the result shows that ILAPF is more
accurate and faster than a recently published state-ofthe-art robust particle

anterior chamber cannulation with eight lectin-fluorophore conjugates, followed
by optical clearance with benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate (BABB). RSCM and an
advanced analysis software (Imaris) were used to reconstruct a
three-dimensional, whole-specimen rendering of the perilimbal outflow
structures. We performed morphometric analyses of the outflow tract from the
level of the trabecular meshwork (TM) to the scleral vascular plexus (SVP).
Results: Except for pigmented structures, BABB cleared the entire eye.
Rhodamine-conjugated Glycine max agglutinin (soybean, SBA) labeled the outflow
tract evenly and retained fluorescence for months. RSCM produced terabyte-sized
files allowing for in silico dissection of outflow tract vessel at a high
resolution and in 3D. Networks of interconnected lumina were traced from the TM
to downstream drainage structures. The collector channel (CC) volumes were ten
times smaller than the receiving SVP vessels, the largest of which were in the
inferior limbus. Proximal CC diameters were up to four times the size of distal
diameters and more elliptical at their proximal ends. The largest CCs were
found in the superonasal and inferonasal quadrants where the highest outflow

""move code close to the data"", what implies that data mining functionalities
are becoming a must to allow the science exploitation. To enable these
capabilities, a TAP+ interface, crossmatch capabilities, full catalogue
histograms, serialisation of intermediate results in cloud resources like
VOSpace, etc have been implemented for the Gaia DR1, to enable the exploitation
of these science resources by the community without the bottlenecks on the
connection bandwidth. We present the architecture, infrastructure and tools

A key contributing factor to this problem is that many small farmers lack

leftover crops that spoil, these farmers often sell their crops at unfavorable
low prices. Inevitably, not all crops are sold before spoilage. Even if the
farmers have access to cold storage, the farmers may not know how long to hold
different crops in cold storage for, which hinges on strategizing over when and

to tackle this problem by introducing previous conversational context in terms

and the neutron electric form factor $G_{En}$, suggesting that those form
factors are dominated by the same physical processes. Those relations are
improved in order to satisfy a fundamental constraint between the electric and
Coulomb quadrupole form factors in the long wavelength limit, when the photon
three-momentum vanishes (Siegert's theorem). Inspired by those relations, we
study alternative parametrizations for the neutron electric form factor. The
parameters of the new form are then determined by a combined fit to the
$G_{En}$ and the $\gamma^\ast N \to \Delta(1232)$ quadrupole form factor data.
We obtain a very good description of the $G_E$ and $G_C$ data when we combine
the pion cloud contributions with small valence quark contributions to the

of the data is obtained when the second momentum of $G_{En}$ is $r_n^4 \simeq

extension of the pion cloud. We conclude also that those square radii are
related by $r_E^2 - r_C^2 = 0.6 \pm 0.2$ fm$^2$. The last result is mainly the
consequence of the pion cloud effects and Siegert's theorem.

we construct a highest weight module $M^X(\lambda)$ with character
$\epsilon^\lambda {p}_X$. Here $p_X$ is a function that counts partitions not
involving roots in $X$. Examples of such modules can be constructed via
parabolic induction provided $X$ is contained in the set of simple roots of
some Borel subalgebra. However our construction works without this condition

moving object with its measurable violation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation
Theorem (FDT). Although proven for Langevin processes, its validity remains
unclear for discrete Markov systems whose forward and backward transition rates
respond asymmetrically to external perturbation. A typical example is a motor
protein called kinesin. Here we show generally that the FDT violation persists
surprisingly in the high-frequency limit due to the asymmetry, resulting in a
divergent FDT violation integral and thus a complete breakdown of the
Harada-Sasa equality. A renormalized FDT violation integral still well predicts
the dissipation rate when each discrete transition produces a small entropy in
the environment. Our study also suggests a new way to infer this perturbation
asymmetry based on the measurable high-frequency-limit FDT violation.

How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of

itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions
is extremely fragile in the following sense: two perceptively indistinguishable
inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different
interpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of several
widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, relevance
propagation, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that
even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new
systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations
without changing the label. We extend these results to show that
interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly
fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on
why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation
approaches.

some properties of cortical responses (e.g. average firing rates or pairwise

changes and how they might affect downstream stimulus decoding. Here we show
that changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios
(Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking
model nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on
stimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle
temporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid
anesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing
trial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia,
within-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time
scales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In
contrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely
sub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by
firing rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability
tuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability
between states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the
distribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain
fluctuations in the alert state. A population model with stimulus-induced
variability tuning and behaviorally constrained information-limiting
correlations explores the potential enhancement in stimulus discriminability by
the cortical population in the alert state.

visualization of textual data is still in its infancy, especially for the
artistic text. Due to the fact that visualization of artistic text is valuable
and attractive in both art and information science, we attempt to realize this
tentative idea in this article. We propose the Generative Adversarial Network
based Artistic Textual Visualization (GAN-ATV) which can create paintings after
analyzing the semantic content of existing poems. Our GAN-ATV consists of two
main sections: natural language analysis section and visual information
synthesis section. In natural language analysis section, we use Bag-of-Word
(BoW) feature descriptors and a two-layer network to mine and analyze the
high-level semantic information from poems. In visual information synthesis
section, we design a cross-modal semantic understanding module and integrate it
with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create paintings, whose content
are corresponding to the original poems. Moreover, in order to train our
GAN-ATV and verify its performance, we establish a cross-modal artistic dataset
named ""Cross-Art"". In the Cross-Art dataset, there are six topics and each
topic has their corresponding paintings and poems. The experimental results on
Cross-Art dataset are shown in this article.

their ventilating capabilities, limiting their potentials in the control of

experimentally implement an omnidirectional acoustic barrier with planar
profile, subwavelength thickness (0.18lambda) yet high ventilation. The
proposed mechanism is based on the interference between the resonant scattering
of discrete states and the background scattering of continuous states that
induces Fano-like asymmetric transmission profile. Benefitting from the
binarystructured design of coiled unit and hollow pipe, it maximally simplifies
the design and fabrication while ensuring the ventilation for all the non
resonant units with open tubes. The simulated and measured results agree well,
showing the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism to block low frequency
sound coming from various directions while allowing 63% of the air flow to
pass. We anticipate our design to open routes to design sound insulators and to
enable applications in traditionally unattainable cases such as those calling
for noise reduction and cooling simultaneously.

performance indicator; (2) score each type of product complexity by developing
a Hellinger distance-based distribution similarity measurement; and (3) cluster
products into homogeneous complexity groups by using the agglomerative

demonstrate the proposed approach, and a case study of an industrial company in
Edmonton, Canada, is conducted to validate the feasibility and applicability of
the proposed model. This research inventively defines and investigates product

result, we verify an anisotropic effective mass density stemming from the

model scheme, the quantum dot is considered as a InAs three- level system in
Lambda-type configuration with two transition channels. One of channels is
driven by a polarized classical field while the two channels are coupled to the
plasmon modes. Plasmon resonance modes of a nanoshell, in contrast of a
nanosphere, are tunable at demand frequency by controlling the thickness and
the materials of the core and the embedding media. The results reveal that the

Moreover, the anti- bunching behavior of the emitted photons can be controlled
by the geometrical parameters of the system, namely, the quantum dot-metal nano
particle separation distance, as well as the system's physical parameters
including the detuning frequency of the quantum dot transitions with respect to

descendents. The prototypical example is the monster CFT, whose famous genus
zero property is intimately tied to the Rademacher summability of its twined
partition functions, a property which also distinguishes the functions of
Mathieu and umbral moonshine. However, there are now several additional known
examples of extremal CFTs, all of which have at least $\mathcal N=1$
supersymmetry and global symmetry groups connected to sporadic simple groups.
We investigate the extent to which such a property, which distinguishes the
monster moonshine module from other $c=24$ chiral CFTs, holds for the other
known extremal theories. We find that in most cases, the special Rademacher
summability property present for monstrous and umbral moonshine does not hold
for the other extremal CFTs, with the exception of the Conway module and two

the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the macroscopic governing equations for

implementation for CLB method is simplified by using the shift matrix with a
simplified central-moment set, and the consistent forcing scheme is adopted to
incorporate forcing effects. Compared with several D2Q5

equation, the proposed method is shown to be better Galilean invariant through
measuring the thermal diffusivities on a moving reference frame. Thus a higher
Mach number can be used for convection flows, which decreases the computational
load significantly. Numerical simulations for several typical problems confirm
the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the present method. The grid

parameter updates with worst-case perturbations of training data. For smooth
losses, our procedure provably achieves moderate levels of robustness with
little computational or statistical cost relative to empirical risk
minimization. Furthermore, our statistical guarantees allow us to efficiently
certify robustness for the population loss. For imperceptible perturbations,
our method matches or outperforms heuristic approaches.

""Cappuccino"" may imply ""Leisure"", ""Joy"", ""Excellent"" for a user enjoying
coffee, by only a kind of drink for someone else. Such personalized semantics
of course cannot be carried by the standard universal word vectors trained with
huge corpora produced by many people. In this paper, we propose a framework to
train different personalized word vectors for different users based on the very
successful continuous skip-gram model using the social network data posted by

first learned from the background corpora, and then adapted by the personalized
corpus for each individual user to learn the personalized word vectors. We use
two application tasks to evaluate the quality of the personalized word vectors
obtained in this way, the user prediction task and the sentence completion

formation and detachment has also been extensively investigated. For example,
it has been observed that the bubble on a hydrophobic surface is larger than
the one on a hydrophilic surface. However, this phenomenon is not sufficiently
explained in existing literature. To explain it, we redefine the capillary
force at the orifice edge and the adhesive force between bubble and solid.
Subsequently, we are able to establish an approach that quantitatively explains
the relation between bubble volume and surface wettability. In addition, we
also suggest an alternative mechanism of bubble pinch-off. In our opinion, the
formation of bubble neck during pinch-off may be due to three-phase equilibrium
at the orifice edge, and the breakup of bubble neck may result from the
stretching action of the upward buoyancy force and the downward capillary
force.

and trajectory of a microswimmer next to a curved spherical obstacle. The
microswimmer is actuated by a slip velocity on its surface and a uniformly
valid solution is provided by utilizing the Reynolds reciprocal theorem in
conjunction with the exact hydrodynamic solution of translation/rotation of a
sphere in an arbitrary direction next to a stationary obstacle. This approach
permits the hydrodynamic interaction of the microswimmer and the obstacle to be
consistently and accurately calculated in both far and near fields. Based on
the analysis, it was shown that while the ""point-singularity solution"" is valid
when the microswimmer is far from the obstacle, it fails to predict the correct
dynamics when the swimmer is close to the obstacle (i.e. gap size is
approximately twice the characteristic length of the microswimmer). Two
different paradigms for propulsion, so-called ""squirmer"" and ""phoretic"" models,
were examined and for each type of microswimmer, various types of trajectories
are highlighted and discussed under which circumstances the swimmer can be
hydrodynamically trapped or guided by the obstacle. The analysis indicates that
it is always easier to capture a microswimmer in a closed circular orbit with a
large sized obstacle ($\sim 20$-$40$ times larger than the microswimmer size)
as in this case the magnitude of rotational velocity can be sufficiently large
that the swimmer can adjust its distance and orientation vector with the
obstacle.

through their shared spectrum in the face of a common eavesdropper. We consider
two spectrum sharing mechanisms, namely the overlay spectrum sharing (OSS) and
underlay spectrum sharing (USS). In the OSS, MBS and SBS take turns to access
their shared spectrum. By contrast, the USS allows MBS and SBS to
simultaneously transmit over the shared spectrum with the aid of power control
for limiting their mutual interference, thus called interference-limited USS
(IL-USS). In order to take advantage of mutual interference in confusing the
eavesdropper without causing adverse effect on the MU, we propose an
interference-canceled USS (IC-USS) scheme. Closed-form expressions of overall
outage probability and intercept probability are derived for OSS, IL-USS and
IC-USS schemes by taking into account both MBS-MU and SBS-SU transmissions. The
secrecy diversity analysis is also carried out by characterizing an asymptotic
behavior of the overall outage probability with a given intercept probability
in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. It is shown that the secrecy
diversity gains of conventional OSS and IL-USS are zero, whereas the proposed
IC-USS achieves a higher secrecy diversity gain of one. This implies that with
an arbitrarily low overall intercept probability, the conventional OSS and
IL-USS methods converge to their respective outage probability floors, however
the proposed IC-USS scheme can make the overall outage probability
asymptotically decrease to zero by simply increasing the transmit power.
Additionally, numerical results demonstrate an obvious advantage of the
proposed IC-USS over OSS and IL-USS against eavesdropping.

The model is based on the Two Measures Theories (T.M.T.) which introduces a

of dark energy and dark matter. A generalization of the T.M.T. gives a
diffusive non-conservative stress energy momentum tensor in addition to the
conserved stress energy tensor which appear in Einstein equations. These leads
to a formulation of interacting DE-DM dust models in the form of a diffusive
type interacting Unified Dark Energy and Dark Matter scenario. The deviation
from $\Lambda$CDM is determined by the diffusion constant $C_2$. For $C_2=0$
the model is indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM. Numerical solutions of the
theories show that in some $C_2 \neq 0$ the evolution of the early universe is

(i.e., not necessarily bipartite) graph $G(V, E)$ is given in the input, where
each edge in $E$ is {\em realized} independently with probability $p$; the
realization is initially unknown, however, we are able to {\em query} the edges
to determine whether they are realized. The goal is to query only a small
number of edges to find a {\em realized matching} that is sufficiently close to
the maximum matching among all realized edges. This problem has received a
considerable attention during the past decade due to its numerous real-world
applications in kidney-exchange, matchmaking services, online labor markets,
and advertisements.
  Our main result is an {\em adaptive} algorithm that for any arbitrarily small
$\epsilon > 0$, finds a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation in expectation, by
querying only $O(1)$ edges per vertex. We further show that our approach leads
to a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximate {\em non-adaptive} algorithm that also
queries only $O(1)$ edges per vertex. Prior to our work, no nontrivial
approximation was known for weighted graphs using a constant per-vertex budget.
The state-of-the-art adaptive (resp. non-adaptive) algorithm of Maehara and
Yamaguchi [SODA 2018] achieves a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation (resp.
$(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation) by querying up to $O(w\log{n})$ edges per
vertex where $w$ denotes the maximum integer edge-weight. Our result is a
substantial improvement over this bound and has an appealing message: No matter
what the structure of the input graph is, one can get arbitrarily close to the
optimum solution by querying only a constant number of edges per vertex.
  To obtain our results, we introduce novel properties of a generalization of

examined for several stellar models, where we assume the existence of the

find that the pulse profile from the scalarized neutron star in scalar-tensor

scalar field, if the stellar compactness of the both stars is very similar.
That is, the existence of the scalar field does not directly change the pulse

determining the pulse shape even in the scalar-tensor gravity. Additionally, we
find that the pulse shape from the scalarized neutron star is more or less
similar to that from the neutron star with the same mass in general relativity,
while the ratio of the minimum amplitude to the maximum amplitude in the pulse
profile depend strongly on the coupling constant in scalar-tensor gravity,

predictions about a (rest-mass independent) linear Regge trajectory behavior of

($\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}})$ is reported

to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. Jet multiplicity and flavor are
used to enhance signal sensitivity, and dedicated control regions are used to
constrain the dominant backgrounds. The observed and expected signal
significances are, respectively, 1.6 and 1.0 standard deviations, and the
$\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$ cross section
is measured to be 16.9 $^{+13.8}_{-11.4}$ fb, in agreement with
next-to-leading-order standard model predictions. These results are also used
to constrain the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson to
be less than 2.1 times its expected standard model value at 95% confidence
level.

background fields that break spacetime symmetry. The behavior of the background
fields and the types of excitations that can occur depend on whether the
symmetry breaking is explicit or spontaneous. For example, when the breaking is
spontaneous, the background field is dynamical and massless Nambu--Goldstone
and massive Higgs excitations can appear. However, if the breaking is explicit,
the background is nondynamical, and in this case additional metric or vierbein
excitations occur due to the loss of local symmetry, or these excitations can
be replaced by dynamical scalar fields using a Stuckelberg approach. The
interpretation of Noether identities that must hold in each case differs,
depending on the type of symmetry breaking, and this affects the nature of the
consistency conditions that must hold. The Noether identities also shed light
on why the Stuckelberg approach works, and how it is able to restore the broken
spacetime symmetry in a theory with explicit breaking.

model-driven approaches. This work studies a linearized PF model through a
data-driven approach. Both a forward regression model ((P, Q) as a function of
(theta, V)) and an inverse regression model ((theta, V) as a function of (P,
Q)) are proposed. Partial least square (PLS)- and Bayesian linear regression
(BLR)-based algorithms are designed to address data collinearity and avoid
overfitting. The proposed approach is tested on a series of IEEE standard
cases, which include both meshed transmission grids and radial distribution
grids, with both Monte Carlo simulated data and public testing data. The
results show that the proposed approach can realize a higher calculation
accuracy than model-based approaches can. The results also demonstrate that the

We show that if $M$ is of order $10^3$, we can monitor the swarm's relaxation

$\bar\tau$ is the equilibrium relaxation time. As soon as a swarm of this size
attains equilibrium, the ensemble of $M$ final microstates from each run is
sufficient for the evaluation of most equilibrium properties without further
sampling. This approach dramatically reduces the wall-clock time required,
compared to a single long simulation, by a factor of several hundred, at the
cost of an increase in the total computational effort by a small factor. It is
also well-suited to modern computing systems having thousands of processors,

high-precision results in a minimum of wall-clock time. We present results

methods for analyzing segmented trends in individual growth trajectory over
time, where the individuals come from a mixture of two or more latent classes.
These models allow each segment of the overall developmental process within
each class to have a different functional form; examples include two linear
phases of growth, or a quadratic phase followed by a linear phase. The
changepoint (knot) is the time of transition from one developmental phase
(segment) to another. Inferring the location of the changepoint(s) is often of
practical interest, along with inference for other model parameters. A random
changepoint allows for individual differences in the transition time within
each class. The primary objectives of our study are: (1) to develop a PGMM
using a Bayesian inference approach that allows the estimation of multiple
random changepoints within each class; (2) to develop a procedure to
empirically detect the number of random changepoints within each class; and (3)
to empirically investigate the bias and precision of the estimation of the
model parameters, including the random changepoints, via a simulation study. We

Bloch-Kato conjecture in Galois cohomology, proved by Voevodsky. Our concern
here is to lay the foundation for a theory that, we believe, will lead to such
a proof- and to further applications. Let p be a prime number. Let k be a
perfect field of characteristic p. Let m be a positive integer. Our first goal
is to provide a canonical process for ""lifting"" a module M, over the ring of
Witt vectors $W_m(k)$ (of length m), to a $W_{m+1}(k)$-module, in a way that
deeply respects Pontryagin duality. These are our big, medium and small Omega
powers, each of which naturally occurs as a direct factor of the previous one.
In the case where M is a k-vector space, they come equipped with Verschiebung
and Frobenius operations. If moreover the field k is finite, Omega powers are
endowed with a striking extra operation: the Transfer, to shifted Omega powers
of finite-codimensional linear subspaces. To show how this formalism fits into
Galois theory, we first offer an axiomatized approach to Hilbert's Theorem 90
(or more precisely, to its consequence for cohomology with finite coefficients:
Kummer theory). In the context of profinite group cohomology, we thus define
the notions a cyclotomic G-module, and of a smooth profinite group. We bear in
mind that the fundamental example is that of an absolute Galois group, together
with the Tate module of roots of unity. We then define the notion of exact
sequences of G-modules of Kummer type. To finish, we give applications of this
formalism. The first ones are the Stable Lifting Theorems, enabling the lifting
to higher torsion in the cohomology of smooth profinite groups, with p-primary
coefficients. We finish by an application to p-adic deformations. We state and
prove a general descent statement, for the quotient map
$\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.

systems have seen an explosion of papers in the communication community.
However, the interaction of CR and control has remained vastly unexplored. In
fact, when combined with control theory CR may pave the way for new and
exciting control and communication applications. In this paper, the control and
estimation problem via the well known two switch model which represents a CR
link is considered. In particular, The optimal linear estimator subject to a CR
link between the sensor and the estimator is derived. Furthermore, it is shown
that in the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Control law for a closed-loop
system over double CR links is not linear in the state estimate. Consequently,
the separation principle is shown to be violated. Several conditions of
stochastic stability are also discussed. Illustrative numerical examples are
provided to show the effectiveness of the results.

detection of various pathologies. Magnetic Resonance (MR) is more preferred
than Computed Tomography (CT) due to the high resolution in MR images which
help in better detection of neurological conditions. Graphical user interface
(GUI) aided disease detection has become increasingly useful due to the
increasing workload of doctors. In this proposed work, a novel two steps GUI
technique for brain tumor segmentation as well as Brodmann area detec-tion of
the segmented tumor is proposed. A data set of T2 weighted images of 15
patients is used for validating the proposed method. The patient data
incor-porates variations in ethnicities, gender (male and female) and age
(25-50), thus enhancing the authenticity of the proposed method. The tumors
were segmented using Fuzzy C Means Clustering and Brodmann area detection was
done using a known template, mapping each area to the segmented tumor image.
The proposed method was found to be fairly accurate and robust in detecting
tumor.

smartphone to measure the change in barometric pressure from the entrance of
the building to the victim's indoor location. Unlike impractical previous
approaches, our system is the first that does not require the use of beacons,
prior knowledge of the building infrastructure, or knowledge of user behavior.
We demonstrate real-world feasibility through 63 experiments across five

this, this paper promotes image/visual captioning based CAPTCHAs, which is

structured neural-symbolic framework developed in cognitive science over the
past 20 years, with the aim of integrating DL with explicit language structures

ideas of TPGN are: 1) unsupervised learning of role-unbinding vectors of words
via a TPR-based deep neural network, and 2) integration of TPR with typical DL
architectures including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The novelty of
our approach lies in its ability to generate a sentence and extract partial
grammatical structure of the sentence by using role-unbinding vectors, which
are obtained in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate the

where a van der Waals fluid interacting with matter plays the role of dark
energy. The transition towards this phase in the cosmic evolution history is
discussed in detail and, moreover, a complete classification of the future
finite-time singularities is obtained for six different possible forms of the
non-gravitational interaction between dark energy (the van der Waals fluid) and
dark matter. This study shows, in particular, that a universe with a
non-interacting three-parameter van der Waals fluid can evolve into a universe
characterized by a Type IV~(Generalized Sudden) Singularity. On the other hand,
for certain values of the parameters, exit from the accelerated expanding phase
is possible in the near future, what means that the expansion of the universe
in the future could become decelerated. On the other hand, our study shows that
space can be divided into different regions. For some of them, in particular,
the non-gravitational interactions $Q = 3 H b \rho_{de}$, $Q = 3 H b \rho_{dm}$
and $Q = 3 H b (\rho_{de} + \rho_{de})$ may completely suppress future
finite-time singularity formation, for sufficiently high values of $b$. On the
other hand, for some other regions of the parameter space, the mentioned
interactions would not affect the singularity type, namely the Type IV
singularity generated in the case of the non-interacting model would be
preserved. A similar conclusion has been archived for the cases of $Q = 3 b H
\rho_{de}\rho_{dm}/(\rho_{de}+\rho_{dm})$, $Q = 3 b H
\rho_{dm}^{2}/(\rho_{de}+\rho_{dm})$ and $Q = 3 b H

one difference: the $Q = 3 b H \rho_{dm}^{2}/(\rho_{de}+\rho_{dm})$ interaction
will change the Type IV singularity of the non-interacting model into a Type
II~(The Sudden) singularity.

leads to the existence of the so called precursor operators. These are boundary
operators that carry non-local information regarding events occurring deep
inside the bulk and which cannot be causally connected to the boundary. Such
non-local operators can distinguish non-vacuum-like excitations within the bulk
that cannot be observed by any local gauge invariant operators in the boundary.
The boundary precursors are expected to become increasingly non-local the
further the bulk process is from the boundary. Such phenomena are expected to
be related to the extended nature of the strings. Standard gauge invariance in
the boundary theory equates to quantum error correction which furthermore
establishes localisation of bulk information. I show that when double field
theory quantum error correction prescriptions are considered in the bulk, gauge
invariance in the boundary manifests residual effects associated to stringy
winding modes. Also, an effect of double field theory quantum error correction
is the appearance of positive cosmological constant. The emergence of spacetime
from the entanglement structure of a dual quantum field theory appears in this
context to generalise for de-Sitter spacetimes as well.
