recombination process. The model has one electronic and one nuclear degree of
freedom and it can be solved to high precision, without making any physically
motivated approximations, by employing the exterior complex scaling method
together with the finite-elements method and discrete variable representation.
The approach is applied to solve a model for dissociative recombination of
H$_2^+$ and the results serve as a benchmark to test validity of several
physical approximations commonly used in the computational modeling of
dissociative recombination for real molecular targets. The second, approximate,
set of calculations employs a combination of multi-channel quantum defect
theory and frame transformation into a basis of Siegert pseudostates. The cross
sections computed with the two methods are compared in detail for collision
energies from 0 to 2 eV.

data were obtained from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager

data were obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory / Atmospheric Imaging

allowed to determine at first the photon spectra based on the KORONAS-F/IRIS
observations and then to reconstruct the energy spectra of the emitting
electrons using the random search method and the Tikhonov regularization
method. In the second chapter the developed technique of simultaneously fitting
the model differential emission measure functions (DEM) to RHESSI and SDO/AIA
data is introduced, which allowed to infer the electron distribution from X-ray
and EUV observations. The proposed method allows to reconstruct of both the
spectra of accelerated/heated electrons and the basic parameters of the flare
plasma, such as temperature, emission measure, total electron number density,
and flare energy. In addition, the analytical function suitable for both DEM
analysis and mean electron flux spectra in flares has been developed and
applied, as well as kappa-distribution in the form of differential emission
measure. The thermal balance and hard X-ray emission of coronal loops from

half-light radius where dynamical models (\eg lowered Maxwellian distributions)
make robust predictions for the stellar proper motions. The observed proper
motions in this outer field show evidence for anisotropy in the velocity
distribution as well as skewness; the latter is evidence of rotation. The
measured velocity dispersions and surface brightness distributions agree in
detail with a rotating, anisotropic model of the stellar distribution function
with mild dependence of the proper-motion dispersion on mass. However, the best
fitting models under-predict the rotation and skewness of the stellar
velocities. In the second field, centered on the core of the cluster, the mass
segregation in proper motion is much stronger. Nevertheless the model developed
in the outer field can be extended inward by taking this mass segregation into
account in a heuristic fashion. The proper motions of the main-sequence stars
yield a mass estimate of the cluster of $1.31 \pm 0.02 \times 10^6

can be heavily influenced by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Due to
these perturbative effects, the stellar binaries in dense environments are
likely to experience mergers, collisions or ejections through secular and/or
non-secular interactions. More direct interactions with the central SMBH are
thought to produce hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events
(TDEs). In this paper, we use N-body simulations to study the dynamics of
stellar binaries orbiting a central SMBH primary with an outer SMBH secondary
orbiting this inner triple. The effects of the secondary SMBH on the event
rates of HVSs, TDEs and stellar mergers are investigated, as a function of the
SMBH-SMBH binary mass ratio. Our numerical experiments reveal that, relative to
the isolated SMBH case, the TDE and HVS rates are enhanced for, respectively,
the smallest and largest mass ratio SMBH-SMBH binaries. This suggests that the
observed event rates of TDEs and HVSs have the potential to serve as a
diagnostic of the mass ratio of a central SMBH-SMBH binary. The presence of a
secondary SMBH also allows for the creation of hypervelocity binaries.
Observations of these systems could thus constrain the presence of a secondary

propagation vectors are observed to rotate when magnetic fields applied
perpendicular to the rhombohedral (polar) axis exceed a pinning threshold value

show that inertial contribution to mean speed comes from dynamic coupling
between translation and rotation, which occurs only for strokes that break
axial symmetry. Remarkably, this effect enables overcoming the scallop theorem
on impossibility of propulsion by time-reversible stroke. We study examples of
tangential strokes of axisymmetric travelling wave, and of asymmetric
time-reversible flapping. In the latter case, we find that inertia-driven mean
speed is optimized for flapping frequency and swimmer's size which fall well
within the range of realistic physical values for Volvox colonies. We
conjecture that similarly to Paramecium, large Volvox could use time-reversible
strokes for inertia-driven swimming coupled with their rotations.

a generic probe system (represented by a mass $M$), bilinearly coupled to a
bath of harmonic oscillators, has been a standard paradigm for a microscopic
theory of stochastic processes for several decades. The question that we probe
in this paper is, how far the structure of the classical FDR is robust, when
one replaces the harmonic bath by an anharmonic one in the limit of strong
system-bath coupling? Such a picture carries the signature of the probe system
in the zeroth order through a nonlocal time kernel. We observe that the
two-time noise correlations hold out a rich structure from which the usual FDR
emerges only in the leading order of perturbation. Beyond this order, multiple
time scales and nontrivial dependence on the temperature starts manifesting.
These new aspects conspire to break the time-translational invariance of the
noise-correlations. Several other interesting features show up and we discuss
them methodically through rigorous calculations order-by-order in perturbation.
This formalistic derivation along with a specific example of non-linearity can
be easily applied to a huge range of processes and statistical observables that
fall under the purview of system-reservoir theory.

Tunnelling spectroscopy in electrical transport is the primary tool to identify
the presence of Majorana zero-modes, for instance as a zero-bias peak (ZBP) in
differential-conductance. The Majorana ZBP-height is predicted to be quantized
at the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature. Interestingly,
this quantization is a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry,
'particle equals antiparticle'. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization
against disorder, interactions, and variations in the tunnel coupling. Previous
experiments, however, have shown ZBPs much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent
observation of a peak-height close to 2e2/h. Here, we report a quantized
conductance plateau at 2e2/h in the zero-bias conductance measured in InSb
semiconductor nanowires covered with an Al superconducting shell. Our
ZBP-height remains constant despite changing parameters such as the magnetic
field and tunnel coupling, i.e. a quantized conductance plateau. We distinguish
this quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins, by
investigating its robustness on electric and magnetic fields as well as its
temperature dependence. The observation of a quantized conductance plateau
strongly supports the existence of non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes in the
system, consequently paving the way for future braiding experiments.

SiIV absorption at $|v_{\rm LSR}|\leq100$ km/s in the Galactic halo. The gas in
the north predominantly falls in at $-50\lesssim v_{\rm LSR}\lesssim 0$ km/s,
whereas in the south, no such pattern is observed. The SiIV column density has
an average and a standard deviation of $\langle N_{\rm

$N_{\rm SiIV}$ does not significantly correlate with $b$, which cannot be
explained by a commonly adopted flat-slab geometry. We propose a two-component
model to reconstruct the $N_{\rm SiIV}$-$b$ distribution: a plane-parallel
component $N_{\rm DH}^{\perp}$ to account for the MW's disk-halo interface and
a global component $N_{\rm G}$ to reproduce the weak dependence on $b$. We find
$N_{\rm DH}^{\perp}=1.3^{+4.7}_{-0.7}\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $N_{\rm
G}=(3.4\pm0.3)\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the basis of Bayesian analyses and
block bootstrapping. The global component is most likely to have a Galactic
origin, although its exact location is uncertain. If it were associated with

considerable amount of gas at $|v_{\rm LSR}|\leq100$ km s$^{-1}$ hidden in the

normal forms in modal logic based on coalgebra. Disjunctive bases were defined
in previous work on completeness for modal fixpoint logics, where they played a
central role in the proof of a generic completeness theorem for coalgebraic
mu-calculi. Believing the concept has a much wider significance, here we
investigate it more thoroughly in its own right. We show that the presence of a
disjunctive basis at the ""one-step"" level entails a number of good properties
for a coalgebraic mu-calculus, in particular, a simulation theorem showing that
every alternating automaton can be transformed into an equivalent
nondeterministic one. Based on this, we prove a Lyndon theorem for the full
fixpoint logic, its fixpoint-free fragment and its one-step fragment, and a
Uniform Interpolation result, for both the full mu-calculus and its
fixpoint-free fragment.
  We also raise the questions, when a disjunctive basis exists, and how
disjunctive bases are related to Moss' coalgebraic ""nabla"" modalities. Nabla
formulas provide disjunctive bases for many coalgebraic modal logics, but there
are cases where disjunctive bases give useful normal forms even when nabla
formulas fail to do so, our prime example being graded modal logic. We also
show that disjunctive bases are preserved by forming sums, products and
compositions of coalgebraic modal logics, providing tools for modular
construction of modal logics admitting disjunctive bases. Finally, we consider
the problem of giving a category-theoretic formulation of disjunctive bases,
and provide a partial solution.

strong CIII] emission 20<EW(CIII])<40\AA. This makes CIII] the second
most-frequent emission line in the UV-rest spectra of SFGs after

hard radiation field. We present a broad range of observational evidence
supporting the presence of AGN in the strong CIII] emitting population. As
EW(CIII]) is rising, we identify powerful outflows with velocities up to 1014
km/s. The strongest CIII] emitters are preferentially located below the SFGs
main sequence, with the SFR reduced by x2. In addition, the median stellar age
of the strongest emitters is ~0.8 Gyr, three times that of galaxies with
EW(CIII])<10\AA. Spectral line analysis presented in a joint paper by Nakajima
et al. (2017) confirms that the strongest emitters require an AGN. We conclude
that these properties are indicative of AGN feedback in SFGs at 2<z<3.8,
contributing to star-formation quenching. We find that quenching timescales of
0.25-0.5x10^9 years are necessary for such AGN feedback to turn part of the
star-forming galaxy population with Mstar>10^10 MSun at z~3 into the population
of quiescent galaxies observed at redshift z~1-2.

gap corrections to the conventional DFT electronic spectrum. Because there have
been suggestions that this class harbors topological insulating phases, we have
given this possibility attention and found that energy gap corrections indicate
the cubic structures will provide at most a few topological insulators.
Structural instability is addressed by calculating phonon dispersion curves for

requirement for satisfying users' demands by utilizing the multicasting gain
among multiple users. Most existing works assume that the users follow the
prescriptions for content placement made by the system. However, users may
prefer to decide what files to cache. To address this issue, we consider a
network consisting of a file server connected through a shared link to $K$
users, each equipped with a cache which has been already filled arbitrarily.
Given an arbitrary content placement, the goal is to find a delivery strategy
for the server that minimizes the load of the shared link. In this paper, we
focus on a specific class of coded multicasting delivery schemes known as the
""clique cover delivery scheme"". We first formulate the optimal clique cover
delivery problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Using a connection
with the weighted set cover problem, we propose an approximation algorithm and
show that it provides an approximation ratio of $(1 + \log K)$, while the
approximation ratio for the existing coded delivery schemes is linear in $K$.
Numerical simulations show that our proposed algorithm provides a considerable
bandwidth reduction over the existing coded delivery schemes for almost all
content placement schemes.

contradicts standard textbooks, which assume the amplitude remains unchanged in
the process and should be considered as a fundamental $\mathrm{RAM}$

propagation of an infrared laser with frequency $\omega_{0}$ in a wedge-shaped
crystal and an EOM with an RF modulating signal of frequency $\Omega$. Since
${\Omega}\ll \omega_{0}$, we solve Maxwell's equations in a time-varying media

quasi-plane waves. From the emerging fields of the setup, we compute the

Mesoscopic physics based optical partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) was recently

strength ( Ld) which represents the degree of nanoscale structural disorder
inside the cells. It was shown that cancerous cells have higher disorder
strength than the normal cells. In this work, using the PWS technique, we
analyzed the hierarchy of different types of prostate cancer cells by
quantifying their average disorder strengths. The results showed that increase

fields such as quantum mechanics, fractional evolution problems, and
quaternionic Schur analysis, just to name a few. The main difference between
complex and quaternionic operator theory is based on the definition of
spectrum. In fact, in quaternionic operator theory the classical notion of
resolvent operator and the one of spectrum need to be replaced by the two
$S$-resolvent operators and the $S$-spectrum. This is a consequence of the
non-commutativity of the quaternionic setting. Indeed, the $S$-spectrum of a
quaternionic linear operator $T$ is given by the non invertibility of a second
order operator. This presents new challenges which makes our approach to
perturbation theory of quaternionic operators different from the classical
case. In this paper we study the problem of perturbation of a quaternionic
normal operator in a Hilbert space by making use of the concepts of
$S$-spectrum and of slice hyperholomorphicity of the $S$-resolvent operators.
For this new setting we prove results on the perturbation of quaternionic
normal operators by operators belonging to a Schatten class and give conditions
which guarantee the existence of a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace of a
quaternionic linear operator.

that for the Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) random network, the CNS distribution of
node sets of any particular size obeys the Poisson law. We also connect the
node-similarity distribution to the link prediction problem. We found that the
performance of link prediction depends solely on the CNS distributions of the
connected and unconnected node pairs in the network. Furthermore, we derive
theoretical solutions of two key evaluation metrics in link prediction: i)
precision and ii) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
We show that for any link prediction method, if the similarity distributions of
the connected and unconnected node pairs are identical, the AUC will be $0.5$.
The theoretical solutions are elegant alternatives of the traditional

modeled as a collection of random fields, have shown close performance with
LSTM LMs in speech recognition and are computationally more efficient in
inference. However, the training efficiency of neural TRF LMs is not
satisfactory, which limits the scalability of TRF LMs on large training corpus.
In this paper, several techniques on both model formulation and parameter
estimation are proposed to improve the training efficiency and the performance
of neural TRF LMs. First, TRFs are reformulated in the form of exponential
tilting of a reference distribution. Second, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE)
is introduced to jointly estimate the model parameters and normalization
constants. Third, we extend the neural TRF LMs by marrying the deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) and the bidirectional LSTM into the
potential function to extract the deep hierarchical features and
bidirectionally sequential features. Utilizing all the above techniques enables
the successful and efficient training of neural TRF LMs on a 40x larger

genetic algorithms for evolving the architectures and connection weight

initializing connection weights of deep convolutional neural networks, which is
expected to avoid networks getting stuck into local minima which is typically a
major issue in the backward gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, a novel
fitness evaluation method is proposed to speed up the heuristic search with
substantially less computational resource. The proposed algorithm is examined
and compared with 22 existing algorithms on nine widely used image
classification tasks, including the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental

richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable

progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how
individual genetic factors cause major human diseases. In this work, we focus
on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which
can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple
causes? How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables
influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal
relationships? To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality
and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first, we describe implicit causal
models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an
implicit density. For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that
adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. In experiments, we
scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements. We achieve
state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly
outperform existing genetics methods by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%.

RMT-based data-mining framework with conventional techniques, some heuristics
are derived as the solution to the invisible units detection and estimation

the hypothesis testing is formulated to conduct change point detection in the
high-dimensional space. The proposed method is promising for anomaly detection

invisible power usage and fraudulent behavior while even being able to locate
the suspect's location. Case studies, using both simulated data and actual

weakly consistent shared memory multi-core processor. The execution cost of
these instructions is significant and adds a non-trivial overhead to parallel
programs. In a naive architecture implementation, we track the ordering
constraints imposed by a fence by its entry in the reorder buffer and its
execution overhead entails stalling the processor's pipeline until the store
buffer is drained and also conservatively invalidating speculative loads. These
actions create a cascading effect of increased overhead on the execution of the
following instructions in the program. We find these actions to be overly
restrictive and that they can be further relaxed thereby allowing aggressive
optimizations.
  The current work proposes a lightweight mechanism in which we assign ordering
tags, called versions, to load and store instructions when they reside in the
load/store queues and the write buffer. The version assigned to a memory access
allows us to fully exploit the relaxation allowed by the weak consistency model
and restricts its execution in such a way that the ordering constraints by the
model are satisfied. We utilize the information captured through the assigned
versions to reduce stalls caused by waiting for the store buffer to drain and
to avoid unnecessary squashing of speculative loads, thereby minimizing the
re-execution penalty. This method is particularly effective for the release
consistency model that employs uni-directional fence instructions. We show that
this mechanism reduces the ordering instruction latency by 39.6% and improves
program performance by 11% on average over the baseline implementation.

known that crack always leads the failure by crossing the critical domain in

Firstly, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) assisted particle swarm
optimization (PSO) is suggested. In this method, to improve the efficiency of
CCP, the BPNN is used to build the metamodel instead of the forward evaluation.
Secondly, the popular PSO is used. Considering the optimization iteration is a
time consuming process, an efficient reanalysis based extended finite element
methods (X-FEM) is used to substitute the complete X-FEM solver to calculate
the crack propagation path. Moreover, an adaptive subdomain partition strategy
is suggested to improve the fitting accuracy between real crack and specified

methods can carry out the CCP. The selection of them should be determined by
the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.

anticorrelation with metallicity. AGB progenitor masses are estimated for the
WD companions of RE~J0702+129 (1.47 $M_{\odot}$) and BD+80$^\circ$670 (3.59

support that the origin of s-process overabundances in Ba dwarfs is similar to
Ba giants via McClure hypothesis in which Ba stars accumulate s-process
elements through mass transfer from their host companions during AGB phase.

humans to control the field of view (FoV) through head movement (HM). Thus, HM
plays a key role in modeling human attention on panoramic video. This paper
establishes a database collecting subjects' HM in panoramic video sequences.
From this database, we find that the HM data are highly consistent across
subjects. Furthermore, we find that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be
applied to predict HM positions, via maximizing the reward of imitating human
HM scanpaths through the agent's actions. Based on our findings, we propose a
DRL-based HM prediction (DHP) approach with offline and online versions, called
offline-DHP and online-DHP. In offline-DHP, multiple DRL workflows are run to
determine potential HM positions at each panoramic frame. Then, a heat map of
the potential HM positions, named the HM map, is generated as the output of
offline-DHP. In online-DHP, the next HM position of one subject is estimated
given the currently observed HM position, which is achieved by developing a DRL
algorithm upon the learned offline-DHP model. Finally, the experiments validate
that our approach is effective in both offline and online prediction of HM
positions for panoramic video, and that the learned offline-DHP model can
improve the performance of online-DHP.

  (Technical Report)","A technical report of a TACAS'17 paper",,,,"cs.LO cs.DC cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of automatically verifying that a parameterized
family of probabilistic concurrent systems terminates with probability one for
all instances against adversarial schedulers. A parameterized family defines an
infinite-state system: for each number n, the family consists of an instance
with n finite-state processes. In contrast to safety, the parameterized
verification of liveness is currently still considered extremely challenging
especially in the presence of probabilities in the model. One major challenge
is to provide a sufficiently powerful symbolic framework. One well-known
symbolic framework for the parameterized verification of non-probabilistic
concurrent systems is regular model checking. Although the framework was
recently extended to probabilistic systems, incorporating fairness in the
framework - often crucial for verifying termination - has been especially
difficult due to the presence of an infinite number of fairness constraints
(one for each process). Our main contribution is a systematic,
regularity-preserving, encoding of finitary fairness (a realistic notion of
fairness proposed by Alur & Henzinger) in the framework of regular model
checking for probabilistic parameterized systems. Our encoding reduces
termination with finitary fairness to verifying parameterized termination
without fairness over probabilistic systems in regular model checking (for
which a verification framework already exists). We show that our algorithm
could verify termination for many interesting examples from distributed
algorithms (Herman's protocol) and evolutionary biology (Moran process, cell
cycle switch), which do not hold under the standard notion of fairness. To the
best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first fully-automatic method that
can prove termination for these examples.

consider the X-ray emission from a remnant disk and the non-thermal nebular
emission from disk-driven outflows or pulsar winds. We demonstrate that
late-time X-ray and high-frequency radio emission can provide useful
constraints on properties of the hidden compact remnants and their connections

external inverse-Compton radiation due to up-scattering of X-ray photons by
relativistic electrons in the jet. We also search for high-energy gamma-rays

significant, persists from WMAP to Planck data. We first present a simple toy
model corresponding to a network of frustrated topological defects of domain
walls or cosmic strings that exist previous to the standard slow-roll
inflationary era of the universe. Those features are phenomenologically modeled
by a Chaplygin gas that can interpolate between a network of frustrated
topological defects and a de Sitter-like or a power-law inflationary era. We
show that these scenarios can alleviate the quadrupole anomaly of the CMB
spectrum, based on the approximate initial conditions for the long-wavelength
perturbations. We then go further to show that the large-scale spectrum at the
end of inflation reflects the super-horizon spectrum of the initial state of
the inflaton field. By studying the curvature perturbations of a scalar field
in the FLRW universe parameterized by the equation of state parameter w, we
find that the large-scale spectrum is suppressed if the universe begins with
the adiabatic vacuum in a superinflation (w < -1) or positive-pressure (w > 0)
era. In the latter case, there is however no causal mechanism to establish the
initial adiabatic vacuum. To search for a more realistic initial condition of
the inflationary universe, we consider the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wave
function, which is a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, as the initial
condition of the universe. We find that the power suppression can be the
consequence of a massive inflaton, whose initial vacuum is the Euclidean
instanton in a compact manifold. We calculate the primordial power spectrum of
the perturbations and show that, as long as the scalar field is moderately
massive, the power spectrum is suppressed at the long-wavelength scales.

new generative adversarial framework by representing each layer as a tensor
structure connected by multilinear operations, aiming to reduce the number of
model parameters by a large factor while preserving the generative performance
and sample quality. To learn the model, we employ an efficient algorithm which
alternatively optimizes both discriminator and generator. Experimental outcomes
demonstrate that our model can achieve high compression rate for model

recognition (ASR) systems, the models still suffer from several problems,
mainly due to the mismatch between the training and inference conditions. In
the sequence-to-sequence architecture, the model is trained to predict the
grapheme of the current time-step given the input of speech signal and the
ground-truth grapheme history of the previous time-steps. However, it remains
unclear how well the model approximates real-world speech during inference.
Thus, generating the whole transcription from scratch based on previous
predictions is complicated and errors can propagate over time. Furthermore, the
model is optimized to maximize the likelihood of training data instead of error
rate evaluation metrics that actually quantify recognition quality. This paper
presents an alternative strategy for training sequence-to-sequence ASR models
by adopting the idea of reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike the standard
training scheme with maximum likelihood estimation, our proposed approach
utilizes the policy gradient algorithm. We can (1) sample the whole
transcription based on the model's prediction in the training process and (2)
directly optimize the model with negative Levenshtein distance as the reward.
Experimental results demonstrate that we significantly improved the performance

that has been proposed to automate architecture design. NAS has been
successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best
human-designed architectures. However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and
training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing

transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks. In this paper, we present the
Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller. Our goal is to learn a
generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful

well-performing, specialized models for each task. We then show that
pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks. By leveraging
knowledge from previous searches, we find that pre-trained MNMS models start
from a better location in the search space and reduce search time on unseen
tasks, while still discovering models that outperform published human-designed

  Under the assumption that the density $\rho(t,x)$ verifies $\rho(0,x)\ge c>0$
and $\sup_{t\ge0}\|\rho(t)\|_{C^\alpha}\le M$ with $\alpha$ sufficiently small,
we establish a new mechanism for the convergence of the solution to its
associated equilibrium with an explicit decay rate which is as the same as that
for the heat equation. The main idea of the proof relies on the basic energy
identity, techniques from blow-up criterion and a new estimate for the low
frequency part of the solution.
  We prove the global-in-time stability for the equations, i.e, any perturbed
solution will remain close to the reference solution if initially they are
close to each other. Our result implies that the set of the smooth and bounded
solutions is an open set.
  Going beyond the close-to-equilibrium setting, we construct the global large
solutions to the equations with a class of initial data in $L^p$ type critical

creates the mass term in the Dirac Hamiltonian that acts as the effective model

$n=\pm 1$ Landau level. Without the mass term, the ground state in the Laughlin
state featuring valley degeneracy and the lowest excitation is characterized by
the valley unpolarized state (known as the valley skyrmion state). Conversely,
we find that the mass-term lifts the valley degeneracy due to the breaking of
the inversion symmetry. We also demonstrate that the valley unpolarized
excitation is suppressed and that the fully or partially polarized state
appears in the lowest excitation by increasing the mass term. Finally, we
discuss the stability of FQH states in the massive Dirac Hamiltonian in
experimental situations. We find that our numerical results are in agreement

to allow the binary system to lead to a more or less spherical explosion and to
prevent a pre-explosion ionizing radiation. Considering these recent results

more favorable over the other scenarios, followed by the double degenerate

a probability model from data. In this paper, we aim to provide an
understanding of some of the basic issues surrounding GANs including their
formulation, generalization and stability on a simple benchmark where the data
has a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Even in this simple benchmark,
the GAN problem has not been well-understood as we observe that existing
state-of-the-art GAN architectures may fail to learn a proper generative
distribution owing to (1) stability issues (i.e., convergence to bad local
solutions or not converging at all), (2) approximation issues (i.e., having
improper global GAN optimizers caused by inappropriate GAN's loss functions),
and (3) generalizability issues (i.e., requiring large number of samples for
training). In this setup, we propose a GAN architecture which recovers the
maximum-likelihood solution and demonstrates fast generalization. Moreover, we
analyze global stability of different computational approaches for the proposed
GAN optimization and highlight their pros and cons. Finally, we outline an
extension of our model-based approach to design GANs in more complex setups
than the considered Gaussian benchmark.

provide strong evidence that the replica bands observed in the single-layer

loss processes of the escaping photoelectron, resulted from the well-known
strong coupling of external propagating electrons to Fuchs-Kliewer (F-K)

ARPES on single-layer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ is calculated using the demonstrated
successful semi-classical dielectric theory in describing low energy electron
energy loss spectroscopy of ionic insulators. Our result shows that the
observed replica bands are mostly a result of extrinsic photoelectron energy
loss and not a result of the electron phonon interaction of the Fe d electrons
with the substrate phonons. The strong enhancement of the superconducting
transition temperature in these monolayers remains an open question.

cloud radio access networks (CRAN), various approaches have been proposed based
on the channel sparsification assumption, namely, only a small subset of the
deployed remote radio heads (RRHs) are of significance to any user in the
system. Motivated by the potential of compressive sensing (CS) techniques in
this setting, this paper provides a rigorous description of the performance
limits of many practical CS algorithms by considering the performance of the,
so called, oracle estimator, which knows a priori which RRHs are of
significance but not their corresponding channel values. By using tools from
stochastic geometry, a closed form analytical expression of the oracle
estimator performance is obtained, averaged over distribution of RRH positions
and channel statistics. Apart from a bound on practical CS algorithms, the
analysis provides important design insights, e.g., on how the training sequence
length affects performance, and identifies the operational conditions where the
channel sparsification assumption is valid. It is shown that the latter is true
only in operational conditions with sufficiently large path loss exponents.

problems, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature
matching: (1) The DART features are directly employed as local descriptors in a
bag-of-features classification framework and testing is carried out on four
standard event-based object datasets (N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, CIFAR10-DVS,
NCaltech-101). (2) Extending the classification system, tracking is
demonstrated using two key novelties: (i) For overcoming the low-sample problem
for the one-shot learning of a binary classifier, statistical bootstrapping is
leveraged with online learning; (ii) To achieve tracker robustness, the scale
and rotation equivariance property of the DART descriptors is exploited for the
one-shot learning. (3) To solve the long-term object tracking problem, an
object detector is designed using the principle of cluster majority voting. The
detection scheme is then combined with the tracker to result in a high
intersection-over-union score with augmented ground truth annotations on the
publicly available event camera dataset. (4) Finally, the event context encoded

spatio-temporal slices far apart in time, which has not been explicitly tackled

at a unique position where the largest waves appear, phase singularities are

dislocations and lead to a discrimination between successive `extreme' waves

have a simple phase plane representation, and will be described by a symmetry
breaking unfolding of the steady state solutions of NLS. The results are used

reasoning about programs that manipulate resources such as memory locations.
These logics are ""abstract"" because they are independent of any particular
concrete resource model. Their assertion languages, called propositional
abstract separation logics (PASLs), extend the logic of (Boolean) Bunched
Implications (BBI) in various ways. In particular, these logics contain the
connectives $*$ and $-\!*$, denoting the composition and extension of resources
respectively.
  This added expressive power comes at a price since the resulting logics are
all undecidable. Given their wide applicability, even a semi-decision procedure
for these logics is desirable. Although several PASLs and their relationships
with BBI are discussed in the literature, the proof theory and automated
reasoning for these logics were open problems solved by the conference version
of this paper, which developed a modular proof theory for various PASLs using
cut-free labelled sequent calculi. This paper non-trivially improves upon this
previous work by giving a general framework of calculi on which any new axiom
in the logic satisfying a certain form corresponds to an inference rule in our
framework, and the completeness proof is generalised to consider such axioms.
  Our base calculus handles Calcagno et al.'s original logic of separation
algebras by adding sound rules for partial-determinism and cancellativity,
while preserving cut-elimination. We then show that many important properties
in separation logic, such as indivisible unit, disjointness, splittability, and
cross-split, can be expressed in our general axiom form. Thus our framework
offers inference rules and completeness for these properties for free. Finally,
we show how our calculi reduce to calculi with global label substitutions,
enabling more efficient implementation.

discussed. In most state-of-the-art approaches, there is no central entity
controlling channel access, so there may be arbitrary interference from other
parties. Thus, a suitable channel model for Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication is
the Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC). Employing multiple antennas on a vehicle
or sending over multiple frequencies to make use of diversity are promising
approaches to combat interference. In this setup, an important question about
diversity is how many antennas or orthogonal carrier frequencies are necessary
in order to avoid system breakdown due to unknown interference in AVCs. For
Binary Symmetric AVCs (AVBSC) and a physically meaningful identical
state-constrained jammer, the deployment of a third, uncorrelated receiving
antenna or the parallel transmission over three different orthogonal
frequencies avoids symmetrizability and thus ensures positivity of the capacity
of the overall communication channel. Furthermore, the capacity of the
identical state-constrained composite AVBSC is continuous and shows
super-activation, a phenomenon which was hitherto deemed impossible for
classical communication without secrecy constraints. Subsuming, spatial and
frequency diversity are enablers for reliable communication over communication
channels with arbitrarily varying interference.

devise a number of pair sampling methods according to some empirical

However, this assumption lacks experimental support. Here, we show
dephasing-free two-photon entanglement from an Indium rich single quantum dot
comprising of nuclear spin 9/2 when excited quasi-resonantly. This remarkable
finding is based on a perfect match between our entanglement measurements with
our model that assumes no dephasing and takes into account the detection

hybrid precoding is a promising technique for the future 5G wireless
communications. Due to a large number of antennas but a much smaller number of
radio frequency (RF) chains, estimating the high-dimensional mmWave massive
MIMO channel will bring the large pilot overhead. To overcome this challenge,
this paper proposes a super-resolution channel estimation scheme based on
two-dimensional (2D) u- nitary ESPRIT algorithm. By exploiting the angular
sparsity of mmWave channels, the continuously distributed angle of
arrivals/departures (AoAs/AoDs) can be jointly estimated with high accuracy.
Specifically, by designing the uplink training signals at both base station
(BS) and mobile station (MS), we first use low pilot overhead to estimate a
low-dimensional effective channel, which has the same shift-invariance of array
response as the high-dimensional mmWave MIMO channel to be estimated. From the
low-dimensional effective channel, the super- resolution estimates of AoAs and
AoDs can be jointly obtained by exploiting the 2D unitary ESPRIT channel
estimation algorithm. Furthermore, the associated path gains can be acquired
based on the least squares (LS) criterion. Finally, we can reconstruct the
high-dimensional mmWave MIMO channel according to the obtained AoAs, AoDs, and
path gains. Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed scheme is
superior to conventional schemes with a much lower pilot overhead.

is required to compensate the RF hardware asymmetry.

modulated by various effects before they can be detected at Earth. This process
can be described by the Parker equation, which calculates the phase space
distribution of GCRs depending on the main modulation processes: convection,
drifts, diffusion and adiabatic energy changes. A first order approximation of
this equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter
dependency, the solar modulation potential $\phi$. Utilizing this approach, it
is possible to reconstruct $\phi$ from ground based and spacecraft
measurements. However, it has been shown previously that $\phi$ depends not
only on the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of
interest. We have investigated this energy dependence further, using published
proton intensity spectra obtained by PAMELA as well as heavier nuclei
measurements from IMP-8 and ACE/CRIS. Our results show severe limitations at
lower energies including a strong dependence on the solar magnetic epoch. Based
on these findings, we will outline a new tool to describe GCR proton spectra in
the energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV over the last solar
cycles. In order to show the importance of our modification, we calculate the
global production rates of the cosmogenic radionuclide $^{10}$Be which is a
proxy for the solar activity ranging back thousands of years.

($\textrm{M}_{\star} < 1 \times 10^{10} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$) passive spiral
galaxies are located in the rich Virgo cluster. This is in contrast to low mass
spiral galaxies with star formation, which inhabit a range of environments. We
postulate that cluster-scale gas stripping and heating mechanisms operating
only in rich clusters are required to quench low mass passive spirals, and
ram-pressure stripping and strangulation are obvious candidates. For higher
mass passive spirals, while trends are present, the story is less clear. The
passive spiral bar fraction is high: 74$\pm$15%, compared with 36$\pm$5% for a
mass, redshift, and T-type matched comparison sample of star forming spiral
galaxies. The high mass passive spirals occur mostly, but not exclusively, in
groups, and can be central or satellite galaxies. The passive spiral group
fraction of 74$\pm$15% is similar to that of the comparison sample of star
forming galaxies at 61$\pm$7%. We find evidence for both quenching via internal
structure and environment in our passive spiral sample, though some galaxies
have evidence of neither. From this, we conclude no one mechanism is
responsible for quenching star formation in passive spiral galaxies - rather, a
mixture of mechanisms are required to produce the passive spiral distribution

$Q\in\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_m]$ in $m$ variables of degree $\mathrm{deg}(Q)\leq

nonlinear, potential flow (NLPF) model of water waves over arbitrary
bathymetry, Papoutsellis and Athanassoulis (2017) (arXiv:1704.03276).
Applications considered herein concern the interaction of solitary waves with
bottom topographies and vertical walls both in two- and three-dimensional
environments. The essential novelty is a new representation of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, needed to close the Hamiltonian evolution
equations. This representation emerges from the treatment of the substrate
kinematical problem by means of exact semi-separation of variables in the
irregular fluid domain, established recently by Athanassoulis & Papoutsellis
(2017) (https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2017.0017). The HCMT ensures an efficient
dimensional reduction of the exact NLFP, being able to treat an arbitrary
bathymetry as simply as the flat-bottom case. A key point for the efficient
implementation of HCMT is the fast and accurate evaluation of the space-time
varying coefficients appearing in some of its equations. All varying
coefficients are calculated analytically, resulting in a refined version of the
theory, characterized by improved accuracy at significantly reduced
computational time. This improved version of HCMT is first validated against
existing experimental results and other computations, and subsequently applied
to new solitary wave-bottom interaction problems. The latter include: i) the
investigation of a new type of Bragg scattering effect, appearing when a
solitary wave propagates over a seabed with a sinusoidal patch, and ii) the
disintegration, focusing and reflection of a solitary wave moving over a
three-dimensional bathymetry consisting of parallel banks and troughs, and
impinging on a vertical wall.

  This research was supervised by Prof Ruth E. Baker and Dr Christian A. Yates",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete-state, continuous-time Markov models are becoming commonplace in the
modelling of biochemical processes. The mathematical formulations that such
models lead to are opaque, and, due to their complexity, are often considered
analytically intractable. As such, a variety of Monte Carlo simulation
algorithms have been developed to explore model dynamics empirically. Whilst
well-known methods, such as the Gillespie Algorithm, can be implemented to
investigate a given model, the computational demands of traditional simulation
techniques remain a significant barrier to modern research.
  In order to further develop and explore biologically relevant stochastic
models, new and efficient computational methods are required. In this thesis,
high-performance simulation algorithms are developed to estimate summary
statistics that characterise a chosen reaction network. The algorithms make use
of variance reduction techniques, which exploit statistical properties of the
model dynamics, to improve performance.
  The multi-level method is an example of a variance reduction technique. The
method estimates summary statistics of well-mixed, spatially homogeneous models
by using estimates from multiple ensembles of sample paths of different
accuracies. In this thesis, the multi-level method is developed in three
directions: firstly, a nuanced implementation framework is described; secondly,
a reformulated method is applied to stiff reaction systems; and, finally,
different approaches to variance reduction are implemented and compared.
  The variance reduction methods that underpin the multi-level method are then
re-purposed to understand how the dynamics of a spatially-extended Markov model
are affected by changes in its input parameters. By exploiting the inherent
dynamics of spatially-extended models, an efficient finite difference scheme is
used to estimate parametric sensitivities robustly.

conditions. Yet, in human autoimmune disease IgG anti-MDA responses have not
been well characterized and their potential contribution to disease
pathogenesis is not known. Here, we investigate MDA-modifications and
anti-MDA-modified protein autoreactivity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While RA
is primarily associated with autoreactivity to citrullinated antigens, we also
observed increases in serum IgG anti-MDA in RA patients compared to controls.
IgG anti-MDA levels significantly correlated with disease activity by DAS28-ESR
and serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, and CRP. Mass spectrometry analysis of RA synovial
tissue identified MDA-modified proteins and revealed shared peptides between
MDA-modified and citrullinated actin and vimentin. Furthermore, anti-MDA
autoreactivity among synovial B cells was discovered when investigating
recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from single B cells. Several
clones were highly specific for MDA-modification with no cross-reactivity to
other antigen modifications. The mAbs recognized MDA-adducts in a variety of
proteins. Interestingly, the most reactive clone, originated from an
IgG1-bearing memory B cell, was encoded by germline variable genes, and showed
similarity to previously reported natural IgM. Other anti-MDA clones display
somatic hypermutations and lower reactivity. These anti-MDA antibodies had
significant in vitro functional properties and induced enhanced
osteoclastogenesis, while the natural antibody related high-reactivity clone
did not. We postulate that these may represent distinctly different facets of

chiral behavior has recently raised large attention. This important scientific
endeavor features spin-based integrated quantum technologies. Herein, we
discuss a novel phenomenon based on a resonantly-enhanced quantum spin-Hall
transport of light observed in a dielectric resonator operating near the
bound-state-in-continuum (BIC) regime. The BIC mode is characterized by a
transverse photonic spin angular momentum density extended on a macroscopic
area. As such, the experimental excited mode in near-BIC regime generates
resonant surface waves characterized by spin-momentum locking and that
propagate along the symmetry axes of the structure. In addition, the generated
side waves are interpreted as an abrupt nonparaxial redirection of the exciting
far field light, which is responsible for the spin-to-orbital angular momentum
conversion evidenced in the spin-orbit asymmetry measured in the intensity of
the side waves. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with a
model that combines geometric parallel transport of light polarization and
spin-momentum locking. In addition, breaking the excitation symmetry leads to a
total spin-directive coupling. Our results reveal the possibility of a
BIC-enhanced macroscopic spin-directive coupling, a novel fundamental mechanism
of light-spin manipulation that will have strong impact on emerging quantum
technologies.

the age and the stellar density in which they are embedded. Stellar clusters of
young age and high stellar surface density destroy protoplanetary discs by
external photoevaporation and stellar encounters. Here we consider the effect
of background heating from newly formed stellar clusters on the structure of
protoplanetary discs and how it affects the formation of planets in these
discs. Our planet formation model is build on the core accretion scenario
including pebble accretion. We synthesize planet populations that we compare to
observations. The giant planets in our simulations migrate over large distances
due to the fast type-II migration regime induced by a high disc viscosity
($\alpha=5.4 \times 10^{-3}$). Cold Jupiters (r>1 AU) originate preferably from
the outer disc, while hot Jupiters (r<0.1 AU) preferably form in the inner
disc. We find that the formation of gas giants via pebble accretion is in
agreement with the metallicity correlation, meaning that more gas giants are
formed at larger metallicity. However, our synthetic population of isolated
stars host a significant amount of giant planets even at low metallicity, in
contradiction to observations where giant planets are preferably found around
high metallicity stars, indicating that pebble accretion is very efficient in
the standard pebble accretion framework. On the other hand, discs around stars
embedded in cluster environments hardly form any giant planets at low
metallicity in agreement with observations, where these changes originate from
the increased temperature in the outer parts of the disc, which prolongs the
core accretion time-scale of the planet. We therefore conclude that the outer
disc structure and the planet's formation location determines the giant planet
occurrence rate and the formation efficiency of cold and hot Jupiters.

to some particular aspects of random matrix theory, or as a self-contained
exposition of Wishart matrix moments. Random matrix theory plays a central role
in statistical physics, computational mathematics and engineering sciences,
including data assimilation, signal processing, combinatorial optimization,
compressed sensing, econometrics and mathematical finance, among numerous
others. The mathematical foundations of the theory of random matrices lies at
the intersection of combinatorics, non-commutative algebra, geometry,
multivariate functional and spectral analysis, and of course statistics and
probability theory. As a result, most of the classical topics in random matrix
theory are technical, and mathematically difficult to penetrate for non-experts
and regular users and practitioners. The technical aim of these notes is to
review and extend some important results in random matrix theory in the
specific context of real random Wishart matrices. This special class of
Gaussian-type sample covariance matrix plays an important role in multivariate
analysis and in statistical theory. We derive non-asymptotic formulae for the
full matrix moments of real valued Wishart random matrices. As a corollary, we
derive and extend a number of spectral and trace-type results for the case of
non-isotropic Wishart random matrices. We also derive the full matrix moment
analogues of some classic spectral and trace-type moment results. For example,
we derive semi-circle and Marchencko-Pastur-type laws in the non-isotropic and
full matrix cases. Laplace matrix transforms and matrix moment estimates are
also studied, along with new spectral and trace concentration-type
inequalities.

pairwise kSZ temperature associated with BOSS galaxies. We construct a `Central
Galaxies Catalogue' (CGC) which consists of isolated galaxies from the original

primary CMB contribution. By constructing a halo model to fit the pairwise kSZ

$\bar{\tau}=(0.53\pm0.32)\times10^{-4}(1.65\,\sigma)$ for `LowZ North CGC',
$\bar{\tau}=(0.30\pm0.57)\times10^{-4}(0.53\,\sigma)$ for `LowZ South CGC', and
$\bar{\tau}=(0.43\pm0.28)\times10^{-4}(1.53\,\sigma)$ for `DR13 Group'. In
addition, we vary the radius of the AP filter and find that the AP size of
$7\,{\rm arcmin}$ gives the maximum detection for $\bar{\tau}$. We also
investigate the dependence of the signal with halo mass and find
$\bar{\tau}=(0.32\pm0.36)\times10^{-4}(0.8\,\sigma)$ and
$\bar{\tau}=(0.67\pm0.46)\times10^{-4}(1.4\,\sigma)$ for `DR13 Group' with halo
mass restricted to, respectively, less and greater than its median halo mass,
$10^{12}\, h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. For the `LowZ North CGC' sample restricted
to $M_{\rm h} \gtrsim 10^{14}\, h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ there is no detection of
the kSZ signal because these high mass halos are associated with the
high-redshift galaxies of the LowZ North catalogue, which have limited

reconstruction, $\ell_1$-minimization plays a fundamental role in the
development of sparse optimization theory. The stability of this method has
been addressed in the literature under various assumptions such as restricted
isometry property (RIP), null space property (NSP), and mutual coherence. In
this paper, we propose a unified means to develop the so-called weak stability
theory for $\ell_1$-minimization methods under the condition called weak range
space property of a transposed design matrix, which turns out to be a necessary
and sufficient condition for the standard $\ell_1$-minimization method to be
weakly stable in sparse data reconstruction. The reconstruction error bounds
established in this paper are measured by the so-called Robinson's constant.
  We also provide a unified weak stability result for standard
$\ell_1$-minimization under several existing compressed-sensing matrix
properties. In particular, the weak stability of $\ell_1$-minimization under
the constant-free range space property of order $k$ of the transposed design
matrix is established for the first time in this paper. Different from the
existing analysis, we utilize the classic Hoffman's Lemma concerning the error
bound of linear systems as well as the Dudley's theorem concerning the polytope
approximation of the unit $\ell_2$-ball to show that $\ell_1$-minimization is
robustly and weakly stable in recovering sparse data from inaccurate
measurements.

the learning. This is motivated by miss-alignments in training data, which when
using standard mean squared error loss could severely degrade reconstruction
quality. We prove that training with the Wasserstein loss gives a
reconstruction operator that correctly compensates for miss-alignments in

idea of Approximate Computing, allowing imprecision in the final result in
order to be able to utilize the sparsity of the input matrix and to allow

allows to distribute the calculations over n nodes with only little

sparsity pattern as the input matrix, allowing for efficient reuse of allocated
data structures.
  We evaluate the algorithm with respect to the error that it introduces into
calculated results, as well as its performance and scalability. We demonstrate
that the error is relatively limited for well-conditioned matrices and that
results are still valuable for error-resilient applications like
preconditioning even for ill-conditioned matrices. We discuss the execution
time and scaling of the algorithm on a theoretical level and present a
distributed implementation of the algorithm using MPI and OpenMP. We
demonstrate the scalability of this implementation by running it on a

X-ray binary systems containing neutron stars (NSs). Timing analysis of X-ray
fluxes of more than dozen of such systems reveals remarkable correlations
between the frequencies of two characteristic peaks present in the power
density spectra. The individual correlations clearly differ, but they roughly
follow a common individual pattern. High values of measured QPO frequencies and
strong modulation of the X-ray flux both suggest that the observed correlations
are connected to orbital motion in the innermost part of an accretion disc.
Several attempts to model these correlations with simple geodesic orbital
models or phenomenological relations have failed in the past. We find and
explore a surprisingly simple analytic relation that reproduces individual
correlations for a group of several sources through a single parameter. When an
additional free parameter is considered within our relation, it well reproduces
the data of a large group of 14 sources. The very existence and form of this
simple relation supports the hypothesis of the orbital origin of QPOs and
provides the key for further development of QPO models. We discuss a possible
physical interpretation of our relation's parameters and their links to
concrete QPO models.

states are well known to form at the band inversion points where the degeneracy

to consider this feature, the occurrence of gapless states, a result of the
band inversion process under protection of the symmetries. Similarly, the band
inversion process might even be perceived as necessary to induce 2D topological
phase transitions. To clarify these misleading perspectives, we propose a
simple model with a flexible Chern number to demonstrate that the bulk gapless
states emerge at the phase boundary of topological phase transitions, despite
the absence of band inversion process. Furthermore, the bulk gapless states do
not need to occur at the special $k$-points protected by symmetries. Given the
significance of these fundamental \textit{conceptual} issues and their
wide-spread influence, our clarification should generate strong general

a certain critical Berry phase despite the concentration of Coulomb impurities,

equation relating the angular diameter ($D_A$) and luminosity ($D_L$) distances
at a redshift $z$, $D_LD_A^{-1}(1+z)^{-2}=\eta=1$. However, only very recently
this relation has been observationally tested at high redshifts ($z \approx
3.6$) by using luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and gamma
ray bursts (GRBs) plus angular diameter distances from strong gravitational
lensing (SGL) observations. The results show that no significant deviation from
the CDDR validity has been verified. In this work, we test the potentialities
of future luminosity distances from gravitational waves (GWs) sources to impose
limit on possible departures of CDDR jointly with current SGL observations. The
basic advantage of $D_L$ from GWs is being insensitive to non-conservation of
the number of photons. By simulating 600, 900 and 1200 data of GWs using the

Variations (TTVs) are intrinsically common. The usual procedure for detecting

transiting planets have short periods and shallow transits. Here we introduce
the Spectral Approach to TTVs technique that allows expanding the TTVs catalog
towards lower TTV amplitude, shorter orbital period, and shallower transit
depth. In the Spectral Approach we assume that a sinusoidal TTV exists in the
data and then calculate the improvement to $\chi^2$ this model allows over that
of linear ephemeris model. This enables detection of TTVs even in cases where
the transits are too shallow so individual transits cannot be timed. The
Spectral Approach is more sensitive due to the reduced number of free
parameters in its model. Using the Spectral Approach, we: (a) detect 131 new
periodic TTVs in Kepler data (an increase of ~2/3 over a previous TTV catalog);
(b) Constrain the TTV periods of 34 long-period TTVs and reduce amplitude
errors of known TTVs; (c) Identify cases of multi-periodic TTVs, for which
absolute planetary mass determination may be possible. We further extend our
analysis by using perturbation theory assuming small TTV amplitude at the
detection stage, which greatly speeds up our detection (to a level of few
seconds per star). Our extended TTVs sample shows no deficit of short period or
low amplitude transits, in contrast to previous surveys in which the detection
schemes were significantly biased against such systems.

rotation is studied by direct numerical simulations. The Reynolds number $Re =

is varied from 0 to 1.2, where $U_b$ is the bulk mean velocity, $h$ the half
channel gap width and $\Omega$ the rotation rate. The scalar value is constant
but different at the two walls, leading to steady scalar transport across the
channel. The rotation causes an unstable channel side with relatively strong
turbulence and turbulent scalar transport, and a stable channel side with
relatively weak turbulence or laminar-like flow, weak turbulent scalar
transport but large scalar fluctuations and steep mean scalar gradients. The
distinct turbulent-laminar patterns observed at certain $Ro$ on the stable
channel side induce similar patterns in the scalar gradient field. The main
conclusions of the study are that rotation reduces the similarity between the
scalar and velocity field and that the Reynolds analogy for scalar-momentum
transport does not hold for rotating turbulent channel flow. This is shown by a
reduced correlation between velocity and scalar fluctuations, and a strongly
reduced turbulent Prandtl number of less than 0.2 on the unstable channel side
away from the wall at higher $Ro$. On the unstable channel side, scalar scales
become larger than turbulence scales according to spectra and the turbulent
scalar flux vector becomes more aligned with the mean scalar gradient owing to
rotation. Budgets in the governing equations of the scalar energy and scalar
fluxes are presented and discussed as well as other statistics relevant for

Camera (DECam) across its 520~Mpix science array during 4 years of operation.
These variations are measured using high signal-to-noise aperture photometry of

the telescope dithered to move the sources around the array. A calibration
procedure based on these results brings the RMS variation in aperture
magnitudes of bright stars on cloudless nights down to 2--3 mmag, with <1 mmag
of correlated photometric errors for stars separated by $\ge20$"". On cloudless
nights, any departures of the exposure zeropoints from a secant airmass law
exceeding >1 mmag are plausibly attributable to spatial/temporal variations in
aperture corrections. These variations can be inferred and corrected by
measuring the fraction of stellar light in an annulus between 6"" and 8""
diameter. Key elements of this calibration include: correction of amplifier
nonlinearities; distinguishing pixel-area variations and stray light from
quantum-efficiency variations in the flat fields; field-dependent color
corrections; and the use of an aperture-correction proxy. The DECam response
pattern across the 2-degree field drifts over months by up to $\pm7$ mmag, in a
nearly-wavelength-independent low-order pattern. We find no fundamental
barriers to pushing global photometric calibrations toward mmag accuracy.

parity and time-reversal violating (P,T-odd) interactions can probe new physics
beyond the standard model and also provide insights into the matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the Universe. The EDMs of open-shell atomic systems are sensitive
to the electron EDM and the P,T-odd scalar-pseudoscalar (S-PS) semi-leptonic
interaction, but the dominant contributions to the EDMs of diamagnetic atoms
come from the hadronic and tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) semi-leptonic
interactions. Several diamagnetic atoms like $^{129}$Xe, $^{171}$Yb,
$^{199}$Hg, $^{223}$Rn, and $^{225}$Ra are candidates for the experimental
search for the possible existence of EDMs, and among these $^{199}$Hg has
yielded the lowest limit till date. The T or CP violating coupling constants of
the aforementioned interactions can be extracted from these measurements by
combining with atomic and nuclear calculations. In this work, we report the
calculations of the EDMs of the above atoms by including both the
electromagnetic and P,T-odd violating interactions simultaneously. These
calculations are performed by employing relativistic many-body methods based on
the random phase approximation (RPA) and the singles and doubles
coupled-cluster (CCSD) method starting with the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) wave
function in both cases. The differences in the results from both the methods
shed light on the importance of the non-core-polarization electron correlation
effects that are accounted for by the CCSD method. We also determine electric
dipole polarizabilities of these atoms, which have computational similarities
with EDMs and compare them with the available experimental and other
theoretical results to assess the accuracy of our calculations.

Shockley-Read-Hall theory, and is made to mimic the physical properties in the
CCD as closely as possible. The code runs on a single electrode level and takes
three dimensional trap position, potential structure of the pixel, and
multi-level clocking into account. A key element of the model is that it also
takes device specific simulations of electron density as a direct input,
thereby avoiding to make any analytical assumptions about the size and density
of the charge cloud. This paper illustrates how test data and simulated data
can be compared in order to further our understanding of the positions and

high-order entropy is a weak model when the input contains long repetitions.
Motivated by this, decades of research have generated myriads of so-called
dictionary compressors: algorithms able to reduce the text's size by exploiting
its repetitiveness. Lempel-Ziv 77 is one of the most successful and well-known
tools of this kind, followed by straight-line programs, run-length
Burrows-Wheeler transform, macro schemes, collage systems, and the compact
directed acyclic word graph. In this paper, we show that these techniques are
different solutions to the same, elegant, combinatorial problem: to find a
small set of positions capturing all text's substrings. We call such a set a
string attractor. We first show reductions between dictionary compressors and
string attractors. This gives the approximation ratios of dictionary
compressors with respect to the smallest string attractor and uncovers new
relations between the output sizes of different compressors. We show that the
$k$-attractor problem: deciding whether a text has a size-$t$ set of positions
capturing substrings of length at most $k$, is NP-complete for $k\geq 3$. We
provide several approximation techniques for the smallest $k$-attractor, show
that the problem is APX-complete for constant $k$, and give strong
inapproximability results. To conclude, we provide matching lower and upper
bounds for the random access problem on string attractors. The upper bound is
proved by showing a data structure supporting queries in optimal time. Our data
structure is universal: by our reductions to string attractors, it supports
random access on any dictionary-compression scheme. In particular, it matches
the lower bound also on LZ77, straight-line programs, collage systems, and
macro schemes, and therefore closes (at once) the random access problem for all
these compressors.

from above by the area and the topology of the surface. Combining these results
with work of Fraser-Li, we conclude that the area index of a free-boundary

suitable to perform X-ray spectroscopy measurements. The aim is to implement
MKIDs sensors working in thermal quasi-equilibrium mode to detect X-ray photons
as pure calorimeters. The thermal mode is a variation on the MKID classical way
of operation that has generated interest in recent years. TKIDs can offer the
MKIDs inherent multiplexibility in the frequency domain, a high spatial
resolution comparable with CCDs, and an energy resolution theoretically limited
only by thermodynamic fluctuations across the thermal weak links.
Microresonators are built in Ti/TiN multilayer technology with the inductive
part thermally coupled with a metal absorber on a suspended SiN membrane, to
avoid escape of phonons from the film to the substrate. The mid-term goal is to
optimize the single pixel design in term of superconducting critical
temperatures, internal quality factors, kinetic inductance and spectral energy
resolution. The final goal is to realize a demonstrator array for a next
generation thousand pixels X-ray spectrometer. In this contribution, the status
of the project after one year of developments is reported, with detailed
reference to the microresonators design and simulations and to the fabrication

The data are interpreted in terms of a double peripheral process, involving
pion exchange at the proton vertex followed by elastic photoproduction of a
$\rho^0$ meson on the virtual pion. In the framework of one-pion-exchange
dominance the elastic cross section of photon-pion scattering, $\sigma^{\rm
el}(\gamma\pi^+ \to \rho^0\pi^+)$, is extracted. The value of this cross

networks have enabled potentially sensitive data to be exchanged or shared on
the web. As a result, users' privacy could be exposed to malicious third
parties since they are extremely vulnerable to de-anonymization attacks, i.e.,
the attacker links the anonymous nodes in the social network to their real
identities with the help of background knowledge. Previous work in social
network de-anonymization mostly focuses on designing accurate and efficient
de-anonymization methods. We study this topic from a different perspective and
attempt to investigate the intrinsic relation between the attacker's knowledge
and the expected de-anonymization gain. One common intuition is that the more
auxiliary information the attacker has, the more accurate de-anonymization
becomes. However, their relation is much more sophisticated than that. To
simplify the problem, we attempt to quantify background knowledge and
de-anonymization gain under several assumptions. Our theoretical analysis and
simulations on synthetic and real network data show that more background
knowledge may not necessarily lead to more de-anonymization gain in certain
cases. Though our analysis is based on a few assumptions, the findings still
leave intriguing implications for the attacker to make better use of the
background knowledge when performing de-anonymization, and for the data owners
to better measure the privacy risk when releasing their data to third parties.

Fog computing is a novel paradigm to address such issues. It enables

Fog computing is not a substitute for cloud computing but a powerful
complement. It enables processing at the edge while still offering the
possibility to interact with the cloud. This article presents a comprehensive
survey on fog computing. It critically reviews the state of the art in the
light of a concise set of evaluation criteria. We cover both the architectures

distribution follows an isotropic 3-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) law.
This assumption classically implies the assumption of a ""cos theta"" law for the
flux of atoms leaving the surface, although such a law has no grounds in
surface physics. In a variety of recently developed sub-Doppler laser
spectroscopy techniques for gases one-dimensionally confined in a thin cell,
the specific contribution of atoms moving nearly parallel to the boundary of
the vapor container becomes essential. We report here on the implementation of
an experiment to probe effectively the distribution of atomic velocities
parallel to the windows for a thin (60 microns) Cs vapor cell. The principle of
the set-up relies on a spatially separated pump-probe experiment, where the
variations of the signal amplitude with the pump-probe separation provide the
information on the velocity distribution. The experiment is performed in a
sapphire cell on the Cs resonance line, which benefits of a long-lived
hyperfine optical pumping. Presently, we can analyze specifically the density
of atoms with slow normal velocities ~ 5-20 m/s, already corresponding to
unusual grazing flight theta at ~85{\deg}-88.5{\deg} from the normal to the
surface and no deviation from the M-B law is found within the limits of our
elementary set-up. Finally we suggest tracks to explore more parallel
velocities, when surface details -roughness or structure- and the atom-surface
interaction should play a key role to restrict the applicability of a M-B-type
distribution.

proposed method effectively employs this vector by introducing denoising
autoencoders into random forests. A denoising autoencoder can be trained with
indicator vectors produced from clean and noisy input samples, and non-leaf
nodes where incorrect decisions are made can be identified by comparing the

challenges in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Knowing the properties of the

provide us with details of the early Universe. In fact, the detection of such a
relic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
period, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at
inflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the
Universe after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field
$\phi$, in the so-called ""kination"" model. We assume that the $\phi$ field
decays into both radiation and DM particles, which we take to be Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The present abundance of WIMPs is then
fixed during the kination period through either a thermal ""freeze-out"" or
""freeze-in"" mechanism, or through a non-thermal process governed by the decay
of $\phi$. We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement
that the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM relic budget. Requiring
that BBN occurs during the standard cosmological scenario sets a limit on the
temperature at which the kination period ends. Using this limit and assuming
the WIMP has a mass $m_\chi = 100\,$GeV, we obtain that the thermally-averaged
WIMP annihilation cross section has to satisfy the constraints $4 \times
10^{-16}{\rm \,GeV^{-2}} \lesssim \langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 2\times
10^{-5} {\rm \,GeV^{-2}}$ in order for having at least one of the production
mechanism to yield the observed amount of DM. This result shows how the

particle system where the control law is designed to solve the nonlinear
filtering problem. For the linear Gaussian case, certain simplifications arise
whereby the linear FPF reduces to one form of the ensemble Kalman filter. For
this and for the more general nonlinear non-Gaussian case, it has been an open
problem to relate the convergence and error properties of the finite-N
algorithm to the mean-field limit (where the exactness results have been
obtained). In this paper, the equations for empirical mean and covariance are
derived for the finite-N linear FPF. Remarkably, for a certain deterministic
form of FPF, the equations for mean and variance are identical to the Kalman
filter. This allows strong conclusions on convergence and error properties
based on the classical filter stability theory for the Kalman filter. It is
shown that the error converges to zero even with finite number of particles.
The paper also presents propagation of chaos estimates for the finite-N linear

placed on a substrate: the Fakir configuration of a Cassie-Baxter (CB) state
with a droplet residing on top of roughness grooves and the Wenzel (W) state
characterized by the homogeneous wetting of the surface. We extend a
theoretical model based on the global interfacial energies for both states to
study the wetting behavior of simple and double reentrant surfaces. Due to the
minimization of the energies associated to each wetting state, we predict the
thermodynamic wetting state of the droplet for a given surface and obtain its
contact angle ${\theta}_C$. We first use this model to find the geometries for
pillared, simple and double reentrant surfaces that most enhances ${\theta}_C$
and conclude that the repellent behavior of these surfaces is governed by the
relation between the height and width of the reentrances. We compare our
results with recent experiments and discuss the limitations of this
thermodynamic approach. To address one of these limitations, we implement Monte
Carlo simulations of the cellular Potts Model in three dimensions, allowing us
to investigate the dependency of the wetting state on the initial state of the
droplet. We find that when the droplet is initialized in a CB state, it gets
trapped in a local minimum and stays in the repellent behavior irrespective of
the theoretical prediction. When the initial state is W, simulations show a
good agreement with theory for pillared surfaces, but for reentrant surfaces
the agreement only happens in few cases: for most simulated geometries the
contact angle reached by the droplet in simulations is higher than ${\theta}_C$
predicted by the model. Moreover, we find that the contact angle of the
simulated droplet is higher when placed on the reentrant surfaces than for a
pillared surfaces with the same height, width and pillar distance.

framework to solve Poisson's equation in the presence of discontinuities to

concept behind the CFM is enforcing the jump conditions in a least squares
sense. This concept requires computing integrals over sections of the
interface, which is a challenge in 3-D when only an implicit representation of
the interface is available (e.g., the zero contour of a level set function).
The technique introduced here is based on a new formulation of the least

to simple quadrature after local coordinate transformations. We incorporate
this technique into a fourth order accurate implementation of the CFM, and show
examples of solutions to Poisson's equation computed in 2-D and 3-D.

multi-user interference as noise. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) uses
linearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference
cancellation (SIC) and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some
users to fully decode and cancel interference created by other users. In this
paper, we argue that to efficiently cope with the high throughput,
heterogeneity of Quality-of-Service (QoS), and massive connectivity
requirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design
needs to depart from SDMA and NOMA. We develop a novel multiple access
framework, called Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general
and powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains
SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting
with SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the
interference as noise. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference
and partially treat interference as noise enables to softly bridge the two
extremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference as noise, and
provide room for rate and QoS enhancements, and complexity reduction. The three
multiple access schemes are compared and extensive numerical results show that
RSMA provides a smooth transition between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them
both in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and
user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths and
qualities of Channel State Information at the Transmitter). Moreover, RSMA
provides rate and QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational
complexity for the transmit scheduler and the receivers (number of SIC layers).

direct carbon emissions in the buildings sector should decrease to almost zero
by 2050, but leave unanswered the question how this could be achieved by
real-world policies. We take a modelling-based approach for simulating which
policy measures could induce an almost-complete decarbonisation of residential
heating, the by far largest source of direct emissions in residential
buildings. Under which assumptions is it possible, and how long would it take?
Policy effectiveness highly depends on behavioural decision- making by
households, especially in a context of deep decarbonisation and rapid
transformation. We therefore use the non-equilibrium bottom-up model FTT:Heat
to simulate policies for a transition towards low-carbon heating in a context
of inertia and bounded rationality, focusing on the uptake of heating
technologies. Results indicate that the near-zero decarbonisation is achievable
by 2050, but requires substantial policy efforts. Policy mixes are projected to
be more effective and robust for driving the market of efficient low-carbon
technologies, compared to the reliance on a carbon tax as the only policy
instrument. In combination with subsidies for renewables, near-complete
decarbonisation could be achieved with a residential carbon tax of
50-200Euro/tCO2. The policy-induced technology transition would increase
average heating costs faced by households initially, but could also lead to
cost reductions in most world regions in the medium term. Model projections
illustrate the uncertainty that is attached to household behaviour for
prematurely replacing heating systems.

the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a

superposition of states and entanglement, could furnish an exponential gain in
computing time. A simulation using such resources is called a quantum
simulation. The advantage of quantum simulations over classical ones is well
established at the theoretical, i.e. software level. Their practical benefit
requires their implementation on a quantum hardware. The quantum computer, i.e.
the universal one (see below), has not seen the light of day yet, but the
efforts in this direction are both growing and diverse. Also, quantum
simulation has already been illustrated by numerous experimental proofs of
principle, thanks too small-size and specific-task quantum computers or
simulators. Quantum walks are particularly-studied quantum-simulation schemes,
being elementary bricks to conceive any quantum algorithm, i.e. to achieve
so-called universal quantum computation.
  The present thesis is a step more towards a simulation of quantum field
theories based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs). Indeed, it is shown, in
certain cases, how DTQWs can simulate, in the continuum, the action of
Yang-Mills gauge fields on fermionic matter, and the retroaction of the latter
on the gauge-field dynamics. The suggested schemes preserve gauge invariance on
the spacetime lattice, i.e. not only in the continuum. In the (1+2)-dimensional
Abelian case, consistent lattice equivalents to both Maxwell's equations and
the current conservation are suggested. In the (1+1)-dimensional non-Abelian
case, a lattice version of the non-Abelian field strength is suggested.
Moreover, it is shown how this fermionic matter based on DTQWs can be coupled
to relativistic gravitational fields of the continuum, i.e. to curved
spacetimes, in 1+2 dimensions.

that are approximately sparse with respect to $D$. It is shown that if the

$0<t<4/3$, then signals which are approximately sparse with respect to $D$ can
be stably recovered by the $l_1$-analysis method. In the case of $D=I$, the
bound is sharp, see Cai and Zhang's work \cite{Cai and Zhang 2014}. When $t=1$,
the present bound improves the condition $\delta_s<0.307$ from Lin et al.'s

a tool often used to obtain the vortex parameters, such as the vortex
viscosity, the pinning constant and the depinning frequency. In anisotropic
superconductors, the extraction of these quantities from the measurements faces
new difficulties due to the tensor nature of the electromagnetic problem. The
problem is specifically intricate when the magnetic field is tilted with
respect to the crystallographic axes. Partial solutions exist in the
free-flux-flow (no pinning) and Campbell (pinning dominated) regimes. In this
paper we develop a full tensor model for the vortex motion complex resistivity,
including flux-flow, pinning, and creep. We give explicit expressions for the
tensors involved. We obtain that, despite the complexity of the physics, some
parameters remain scalar in nature. We show that under specific circumstances
the directly measured quantities do not reflect the true vortex parameters, and
we give procedures to derive the true vortex parameters from measurements taken
with arbitrary field orientations. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the
angular scaling properties to the measured and transformed vortex parameters
and we exploit these properties as a tool to unveil the existence of
directional pinning.

data set. It is well known that each persistence module admits the structure of
a representation of a finite totally ordered set. In previous work, the authors
proved an analogue of the isometry theorem of Bauer and Lesnick for
representations of a certain class of finite posets. The isometry was between
the interleaving metric of Bubenik, de Silva and Scott and a bottleneck metric
which incorporated algebraic information. The key step in both isometry
theorems was proving a matching theorem, that an interleaving gives rise to a
matching of the same height. In this paper we continue this work, restricting
to those posets which arise from data while making more general the choice of
metrics. We first show that while an interleaving always produces a matching,
for an arbitrary choice of weights it will not produce one of the same height.
We then show that although the matching theorem fails in this sense, one
obtains a ""shifted"" matching (of the correct height) from an interleaving by
enlarging the category. We then prove an isometry theorem on this extended
category. As an application, we make precise the way in which representations
of finite partially ordered sets approximate persistence modules. Specifically,
given two finite point clouds of data, we associate a generalized sequence
(net) of algebras over which the persistence modules for both data sets can be
compared. We recover the classical interleaving distance uniformly by taking
limits.

unimodular $f(T)$ gravity, which is a modification of teleparallel gravity. We
develop the general reconstruction procedure of the $f(T)$ form that can yield
the holographic feature of the dark energy. We fit the reconstructed model with
the $H(z)$ data and our results show a perfect agreement with the WMAP9
cosmological observational data, at least for the range $-1.10\leq \omega_V
\leq -1.05$. We investigate the consistency of the reconstructed model by
studying its stability against linear gravitational and matter perturbations,
fixing $\omega_V$ to $-1.05$. The model presents stability for both de Sitter
and power-law solutions and we conclude that it is a good candidate as
alternative viable model for characterizing holographic dark energy.

  Breakthrough Starshot?","10 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx2834",,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Upon entering a star system, light sails are subject to both gravitational
forces and radiation pressure, and can use both in concert to modify their
trajectory. Moreover, stars possess significant magnetic fields, and if the
sail is in any way charged, it will feel the Lorentz force also.
  We investigate the dynamics of so-called ""photogravimagnetic assists"" of
sailcraft around $\alpha$ Centauri A, a potential first destination en route to
Proxima Centauri (the goal of the Breakthrough Starshot program). We find that
a 10m$^2$ sail with a charge-to-mass-ratio of around 10 $\mu$C/g or higher will
need to take account of magnetic field effects during orbital maneouvres. The
magnetic field can provide an extra source of deceleration and deflection, and
allow capture onto closer orbits around a target star.
  However, flipping the sign of the sailcraft's charge can radically change
resulting trajectories, resulting in complex loop-de-loops around magnetic
field lines and essentially random ejection from the star system. Even on
well-behaved trajectories, the field can generate off-axis deflections at
$\alpha$ Centauri that, while minor, can result in very poor targetting of the
final destination (Proxima) post-assist.
  Fortunately for Breakthrough Starshot, nanosails are less prone to charging
en route than their heavier counterparts, but can still accrue relatively high
charge at both the origin and destination, when travelling at low speeds.
Photogravimagnetic assists are highly non-trivial, and require careful course
correction to mitigate against unwanted changes in trajectory.

tennis supporters, the ATP ranking is exposed to constant complaints from
players and at the same time exposes new players to be benefited with a good
tournament to be able to start progressing in their careers. Moreover, the ATP
ranking is not powerful enough to predict with certainty who will be the winner
of a match if we are based solely on the positions. In order to combat these
problems, the idea of creating a new ranking that can indicate what are the
real chances of victory of a player before the start of a new tournament
arises. Based on the PageRank method, generated by Larry Page and Sergey Brin,
we created a new ranking that specifically uses the characteristics of the
tournament to generate data. Based on a history of 40,000 matches, we intend to
evaluate how the new method is performed as compared to other existing rankings
in order to analyze if we really achieved an improved and real reflection. Once
we have obtained the ranking, we intend to evaluate, taking a sample game, the
ranking of the players that dispute it and the characteristics of such game to
be able to indicate the precise probability for the player with better ranking
to win the game.

that are tightly bound to each other by the gravitational and electromagnetic
fields, acceleration field and pressure field. The kinetic energy of the
particles of this system is estimated by three methods, and the ratio of the
kinetic energy to the absolute value of the energy of forces, binding the
particles, is determined, which is approximately equal to 0.6 . For simple
systems in classical mechanics, this ratio equals 0.5 . The difference between
these ratios arises by the consideration of the pressure field and acceleration
field inside the bodies, which make additional contribution to the acceleration
of the particles. It is found that the total time derivative of the system's
virial is not equal to zero, as is assumed in classical mechanics for systems
with potential fields. This is due to the fact that although the partial time
derivative of the virial for stationary systems tends to zero, but in real
bodies the virial also depends on the coordinates and the convective derivative
of the virial, as part of the total time derivative inside the body, is not
equal to zero. It is shown that the convective derivative is also necessary for
correct description of the equations of motion of particles.
