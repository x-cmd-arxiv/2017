synthesis (BPS) offers a substantial improvement in efficiency over brute
force, grid-based studies. Even so, BPS models typically require a large number
of simulation realizations, a computationally expensive endeavor, to generate
statistically robust results. Recent advances in statistical methods have led
us to revisit the traditional approach to BPS. In this work we describe our
publicly available code dart_board which combines rapid binary evolution codes,
typically used in traditional BPS, with modern Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods. dart_board takes a novel approach that treats the initial binary
parameters and the supernova kick vector as model parameters. This formulation
has several advantages, including the ability to model either populations of
systems or individual binaries, the natural inclusion of observational
uncertainties, and the flexible addition of new constraints which are
problematic to include using traditional BPS. After testing our code with mock
systems, we demonstrate the flexibility of dart_board by applying it to three
examples: (i) a generic population of high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), (ii)
the population of HMXBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in which the
spatially resolved star formation history is used as a prior, and (iii) one
particular HMXB in the LMC, Swift J0513.4-6547, in which we include
observations of the system's component masses and orbital period. Although this
work focuses on HMXBs, dart_board can be applied to a variety of stellar
binaries including the recent detections by gravitational wave observatories of
merging compact object binaries.

particular, the gravitational interactions of CMB photons with large-scale

the most futuristic case. Ongoing or recently completed CMB experiments
(CMB-S2) will particularly benefit from large-scale structure tracers that,
once properly combined, will have a better performance than a CMB internal
reconstruction. With the decrease of instrumental noise, the lensing B-modes
power removed using CMB internal reconstruction alone will rapidly increase.
Nevertheless, optical galaxy surveys will still play an important role even for
CMB S4. In particular, an LSST-like survey can a achieve a delensing
performance comparable to a 3G CMB experiment but with entirely different
systematics. This redundancy will be essential to demonstrate the robustness
against systematics of an eventual detection of primordial B-modes.

decisions is widely considered a key step toward ensuring safety for robots
operating under uncertainty. But, how should a robot quantify risk? A natural
and common approach is to consider the framework whereby costs are assigned to
stochastic outcomes - an assignment captured by a cost random variable.
Quantifying risk then corresponds to evaluating a risk metric, i.e., a mapping
from the cost random variable to a real number. Yet, the question of what
constitutes a ""good"" risk metric has received little attention within the
robotics community. The goal of this paper is to explore and partially address
this question by advocating axioms that risk metrics in robotics applications
should satisfy in order to be employed as rational assessments of risk. We
discuss general representation theorems that precisely characterize the class
of metrics that satisfy these axioms (referred to as distortion risk metrics),
and provide instantiations that can be used in applications. We further discuss
pitfalls of commonly used risk metrics in robotics, and discuss additional
properties that one must consider in sequential decision making tasks. Our hope
is that the ideas presented here will lead to a foundational framework for
quantifying risk (and hence safety) in robotics applications.

energy dissipation rate obtained from both torque measurements

projections of sets and measures in Euclidean spaces.
  To introduce the first one, assume that $E,K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ are
non-empty Borel sets with $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K > 0$. Does the radial projection
of $K$ to some point in $E$ have positive dimension? Not necessarily: $E$ can
be zero-dimensional, or $E$ and $K$ can lie on a common line. I prove that
these are the only obstructions: if $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} E > 0$, and $E$ does not
lie on a line, then there exists a point in $x \in E$ such that the radial
projection $\pi_{x}(K)$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $(\dim_{\mathrm{H}}
K)/2$. Applying the result with $E = K$ gives the following corollary: if $K
\subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is Borel set, which does not lie on a line, then the
set of directions spanned by $K$ has Hausdorff dimension at least
$(\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K)/2$.
  For the second result, let $d \geq 2$ and $d - 1 < s < d$. Let $\mu$ be a
compactly supported Radon measure in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with finite $s$-energy. I
prove that the radial projections of $\mu$ are absolutely continuous with
respect to $\mathcal{H}^{d - 1}$ for every centre in $\mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus
\operatorname{spt} \mu$, outside an exceptional set of dimension at most $2(d -
1) - s$. In fact, for $x$ outside an exceptional set as above, the proof shows
that $\pi_{x\sharp}\mu \in L^{p}(S^{d - 1})$ for some $p > 1$. The dimension
bound on the exceptional set is sharp.

automatically fixing non-syntactic bugs in source code. The majority of past
work in semantic code repair assumed access to unit tests against which
candidate repairs could be validated. In contrast, the goal here is to develop
a strong statistical model to accurately predict both bug locations and exact
fixes without access to information about the intended correct behavior of the
program. Achieving such a goal requires a robust contextual repair model, which
we train on a large corpus of real-world source code that has been augmented
with synthetically injected bugs. Our framework adopts a two-stage approach
where first a large set of repair candidates are generated by rule-based
processors, and then these candidates are scored by a statistical model using a
novel neural network architecture which we refer to as Share, Specialize, and
Compete. Specifically, the architecture (1) generates a shared encoding of the
source code using an RNN over the abstract syntax tree, (2) scores each
candidate repair using specialized network modules, and (3) then normalizes
these scores together so they can compete against one another in comparable
probability space. We evaluate our model on a real-world test set gathered from
GitHub containing four common categories of bugs. Our model is able to predict

which can succeed in the presence of environmental noise even without error
correction. However, despite great effort, no conclusive proof of a quantum
speedup (relative to state of the art classical algorithms) has been shown for
these systems, and rigorous theoretical proofs of a quantum advantage generally
rely on exponential precision in at least some aspects of the system, an
unphysical resource guaranteed to be scrambled by random noise. In this work,
we propose a new variant of quantum annealing, called RFQA, which can maintain
a scalable quantum speedup in the face of noise and modest control precision.
Specifically, we consider a modification of flux qubit-based quantum annealing
which includes random, but coherent, low-frequency oscillations in the
directions of the transverse field terms as the system evolves. We show that
this method produces a quantum speedup for finding ground states in the Grover
problem and quantum random energy model, and thus should be widely applicable
to other hard optimization problems which can be formulated as quantum spin
glasses. Further, we show that this speedup should be resilient to two
realistic noise channels ($1/f$-like local potential fluctuations and local
heating from interaction with a finite temperature bath), and that another
noise channel, bath-assisted quantum phase transitions, actually accelerates
the algorithm and may outweigh the negative effects of the others. The
modifications we consider have a straightforward experimental implementation
and could be explored with current technology.

be distinguished from the (empirical) degree distribution of the graph that
records the fractions of nodes with given degree. We introduce a general
framework to explore when these two degree distributions coincide
asymptotically in large homogeneous random networks. The discussion is carried
under three basic statistical assumptions on the degree sequences: (i) a weak
form of distributional homogeneity; (ii) the existence of an asymptotic (nodal)
degree distribution; and (iii) a weak form of asymptotic uncorrelatedness. We
show that this asymptotic equality may fail in homogeneous random networks for
which (i) and (ii) hold but (iii) does not. The counterexample is found in the
class of random threshold graphs. An implication of this finding is that random
threshold graphs cannot be used as a substitute to the Barab\'asi-Albert model
for scale-free network modeling, as has been proposed by some authors. The
results can also be formulated for non-homogeneous models by making use of a
random sampling procedure over the nodes.

ruin times caused by jumps larger than a chosen retention level. Otherwise
capital must be raised from the shareholders for small deficits. The problem
here is to determine adequate reinsurance premiums. It seems fair to base the
net reinsurance premium on the discounted expected value of any future capital
injections. Inspired by the results of Huzak et al. (2004) and Ben Salah (2014)
on successive ruin events, we show that an explicit formula for these
reinsurance premiums exists in a setting where aggregate claims are modeled by
a subordinator and a Brownian perturbation. Here ruin events are due either to
Brownian oscillations or jumps and reinsurance capital injections only apply in
the latter case. The results are illustrated explicitly for two specific risk

age, following standard chemical evolution models for the Galaxy, as seen by
different observational results. In this work we show that the Open Cluster
NGC6705/M11 has a significant $\alpha$-enhancement [$\alpha$/Fe]$>0.1$ dex,
despite its young age ($\sim$300 Myr), challenging the current paradigm. We use
high resolution (R$>65,000$) high signal-to-noise ($\sim$70) spectra of 8 Red
Clump stars, acquired within the OCCASO survey. We determine very accurate
chemical abundances of several $\alpha$ elements, using an equivalent width
methodology (Si, Ca and Ti), and spectral synthesis fits (Mg and O). We obtain
[Si/Fe]=$0.13\pm0.05$, [Mg/Fe]=$0.14\pm0.07$, [O/Fe]=$0.17\pm0.07$,
[Ca/Fe]=$0.06\pm0.05$ and [Ti/Fe]=$0.03\pm0.03$. Our results place these
cluster within the group of young [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced field stars recently
found by several authors in the literature. The ages of our stars have an
uncertainty of around 50 Myr, much more precise than for field stars. By
integrating the cluster's orbit in several non-axisymmetric Galactic
potentials, we establish the M11's most likely birth radius to lie between
6.8-7.5 kpc from the Galactic center, not far from its current position. With
the robust Open Cluster age scale, our results prove that a moderate
[$\alpha$/Fe]-enhancement is no guarantee for a star to be old, and that not
all $\alpha$-enhanced stars can be explained with an evolved blue straggler
scenario. Based on our orbit calculations, we further argue against a Galactic
bar origin of M11.

potential thermodynamic potential in the bag-model approximation to quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) that includes a finite $s$-quark mass in the Feynman
diagram contributions for both zero-order and two-loop corrections to the quark
interaction. The thermodynamic potential for quarks in QCD is a desired
ingredient for computations of the equation of state in the early universe,
supernovae, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. The 2-loop contributions
are normally divergent and become even more difficult in the limit of finite
quark masses and finite chemical potential. We introduce various means to
interpolate between the low and high chemical potential limits. Although
physically well motivated, we show that the infinite series Pad\'e rational
polynomial interpolation scheme introduces spurious poles. Nevertheless, we
show that lower order interpolation schemes such as polynomial interpolation
reproduce the Pad\'e result without the presence of spurious poles. We propose
that in this way one can determine the equation of state for the two-loop
corrections for arbitrary chemical potential, temperature and quark mass. This
provides a new realistic bag-model treatment of the QCD equation of state. We
compute the QCD phase diagram with up to the two-loop corrections. We show that
the two-loop corrections decrease the pressure of the quark-gluon plasma and
therefore increase the critical temperature and chemical potential of the phase
transition. We also show, however, that the correction for finite $s$-quark
mass in the two-loop correction serves to decrease the critical temperature for
the quark-hadron phase transition in the early universe.

  Euclidean disks",,,,,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $K$ be a convex body in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb R^2$. We say that a
point set $X \subseteq \mathbb R^2$ satsfies the property $T(K)$ if the family
of translates $\{ K + x : x \in X \}$ has a line transversal. A weaker
property, $T(K, s)$, of the set $X$ is that every subset $Y \subseteq X$
consisting of at most $s$ elements satisfies the property $T(K)$.
  The following question goes back to Gr\""unbaum: given $K$ and $s$, what is
the minimal positive number $\lambda = \lambda(K, s)$ such that every finite
point set in $\mathbb R^2$ with the property $T(K, s)$ also satisfies the
property $T(\lambda K)$? The constant $\lambda_{disj}(K, s)$ is defined
similarly, with the only additional assumption that the translates $x + K$ and
$y + K$ are disjoint for every $x, y \in X$, $x \neq y$.
  One case of particular interest is $s = 3$ and $K = B$, where $B$ is a unit
Euclidean ball. Namely, it was conjectured by Eckhoff and, independently,
Dolnikov that $\lambda (B, 3) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
  In this paper we propose a stronger conjecture, which, on the other hand,
admits an algebraic formulation in a finite alphabet. We verify our conjecture
numerically on a sufficiently dense grid in the space of parameters and thereby
obtain an estimate $\lambda_{disj}(B, 3) \leq \lambda(B, 3) \leq 1.645$. This
is an improvement on the previously known upper bounds $\lambda(B, 3) \leq
\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2} \approx 1.79$ (Jer\'onimo Castro and
Rold\'an-Pensado, 2011) and $\lambda_{disj}(B, 3) \leq 1.65$ (Heppes, 2005).

chains in dilute solution. The effective random walk severely overrates the
occurrence of knots and their complexity, particularly when compared to melts
of flexible chains, indicating that non-trivial effects due to remnants of
self-avoidance still play a significant role for the chain lengths considered
in this numerical study. For melts of semiflexible chains, the effect is less
pronounced. In addition, we find that chains in a melt are very similar in
structure and topology to dilute single chains close to the collapse
transition, which indicates that the latter are also not well-represented by
random walks. We finally show that typical equilibration procedures are
well-suited to relax the topology in melts.

infinite power to preserve its shape. However, the fundamental barrier of
finite power in free space has made the problem of diffraction insurmountable
over the past few decades. Here, to overcome this limitation, we report an
approach that employs the multiple energy oscillation mechanism, thereby
permitting the creation of a light beam with an ultralong anti-diffracting
distance in free space. The anti-diffracting distance is no longer restricted
by finite power in free space but instead depends on the number of energy
oscillations. This unprecedented propagation behavior is attributed to a new
understanding of non-diffractive light beam: when an anti-diffracting light
beam completely discharges its energy, it cannot recharge again. A versatile
optical pen is therefore developed to manipulate the number, amplitude,
position and phase of energy oscillations for an arbitrary numerical aperture
of a focusing lens so that energy recharge can occur in free space and multiple
energy oscillations can be realized. A light beam with a tunable number of
energy oscillations is eventually generated in free space and propagates along
a wavy trajectory. This work will enable extending non-diffractive light beams
to an expanded realm and facilitate extensive developments in optics and other

  Control Design and Experiments",,,,,"cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents two novel control methodologies for the cooperative
manipulation of an object by N robotic agents. Firstly, we design an adaptive
control protocol which employs quaternion feedback for the object orientation
to avoid potential representation singularities. Secondly, we propose a control
protocol that guarantees predefined transient and steady-state performance for
the object trajectory. Both methodologies are decentralized, since the agents
calculate their own signals without communicating with each other, as well as
robust to external disturbances and model uncertainties. Moreover, we consider
that the grasping points are rigid, and avoid the need for force/torque
measurements. Load distribution is also included via a grasp matrix
pseudo-inverse to account for potential differences in the agents' power
capabilities. Finally, simulation and experimental results with two robotic
arms verify the theoretical findings.

Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations
that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the
existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic
transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available. We propose an
algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state

complementarity formulation. Experimental observations for the generated plans
show that the object precisely moves in the grasp as expected by the planner.

and non-colluding servers, $K$ independent datasets, and a user who wants to
compute a function of the datasets privately, i.e., without revealing which
function he wants to compute, to any individual server. This private
computation problem is a strict generalization of the private information
retrieval (PIR) problem, obtained by expanding the PIR message set (which
consists of only independent messages) to also include functions of those
messages. The capacity of private computation, $C$, is defined as the maximum
number of bits of the desired function that can be retrieved per bit of total
download from all servers. We characterize the capacity of private computation,
for $N$ servers and $K$ independent datasets that are replicated at each
server, when the functions to be computed are arbitrary linear combinations of
the datasets. Surprisingly, the capacity,
$C=\left(1+1/N+\cdots+1/N^{K-1}\right)^{-1}$, matches the capacity of PIR with
$N$ servers and $K$ messages. Thus, allowing arbitrary linear computations does
not reduce the communication rate compared to pure dataset retrieval. The same
insight is shown to hold even for arbitrary non-linear computations when the

NGTS builds on the legacy of previous surveys, most notably WASP, and is

than have previously been detected from the ground. It also operates in red
light, maximising sensitivity to late K and early M dwarf stars. The survey
specifications call for photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in red light over
an instantaneous field of view of 100 square degrees, enabling the detection of
Neptune-sized exoplanets around Sun-like stars and super-Earths around M
dwarfs. The survey is carried out with a purpose-built facility at Cerro
Paranal, Chile, which is the premier site of the European Southern Observatory

deep-depletion CCD cameras are used to survey fields intensively at
intermediate Galactic latitudes. The instrument is also ideally suited to
ground-based photometric follow-up of exoplanet candidates from space
telescopes such as TESS, Gaia and PLATO. We present observations that combine
precise autoguiding and the superb observing conditions at Paranal to provide
routine photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in 1 hour for stars with I-band
magnitudes brighter than 13. We describe the instrument and data analysis
methods as well as the status of the survey, which achieved first light in 2015

argued that the mirror fermions do not decouple: in the 345 model with Dirac-
and Majorana-Yukawa couplings to XY-spin field, the two-point vertex function
of the (external) gauge field in the mirror sector shows a singular non-local
behavior in the PMS phase. We re-examine why the attempt seems a ""Mission:
Impossible"" in the 345 model. We point out that the effective operators to
break the fermion number symmetries ('t Hooft operators plus others) in the
mirror sector do not have sufficiently strong couplings even in the limit of
large Majorana-Yukawa couplings. We observe also that the type of Majorana mass
term considered there is singular in the large limit due to the nature of the
chiral projection of the Ginsparg-Wilson fermions, but a slight modification
without such singularity is allowed by virtue of the very nature. We then
consider a simpler four-flavor axial gauge model, the 1$^4$(-1)$^4$ model, in
which the U(1)$_A$ gauge and Spin(6)(SU(4)) global symmetries prohibit the
bilinear terms, but allow the quartic terms to break all the other continuous
mirror-fermion symmetries. In the strong-coupling limit of the quartic
operators, the model is well-behaved and simplified. Through Monte-Carlo
simulations in the weak gauge coupling limit, we show a numerical evidence that
the two-point vertex function of the gauge field in the mirror sector shows a
regular local behavior, and we still argue that all you need is killing the
continuous mirror-fermion symmetries with would-be gauge anomalies non-matched.
Finally, by gauging a U(1) subgroup of the U(1)$_A$$\times$ Spin(6)(SU(4)) of
the previous model, we formulate the $2 1 (-1)^3$ chiral gauge model and argue
that the induced fermion measure term satisfies the required locality property
and provides a solution to the reconstruction theorem.

manifest some tensions with the standard model (SM). Assuming that these
anomalies have a new physics origin, we consider the possibility that a $Z'$
boson is responsible for them. We further assume that its interactions with
quarks also affect rare nonleptonic decays of the $\bar B_s^0$ meson which are
purely isospin-violating and tend to be dominated by electroweak-penguin
contributions, namely $\bar B_s^0\to(\eta,\eta',\phi)(\pi^0,\rho^0)$. Most of
these decays are not yet observed, and their rates are expected to be
relatively small in the SM. Taking into account constraints from various
measurements, including the evidence for $\bar B_s^0\to\phi\rho^0$ recently
seen by LHCb, we find that the $Z'$ effects on $\bar B_s^0\to(\eta,\phi)\pi^0$
can make their rates bigger than the SM predictions by up to an order of
magnitude. For $\bar B_s^0\to\eta'\pi^0,(\eta,\eta')\rho^0$, the enhancement
factors are at most a few. Since the $Z'$ contributions to the different
channels depend on different combinations of its couplings, observations of
more of these decays in future experiments, along with improved $b\to
s\mu^+\mu^-$ data, will probe this $Z'$ scenario more thoroughly.

weak morphisms. The definition is based on the construction of a partial
resolution over $\mathbb{Z}$ of the Koszul dual cooperad of the $\textrm{Lie}$
operad, with free symmetric group action. Weak Lie 3-algebras and their
morphisms are then defined via the usual operadic approach---as solutions to
Maurer--Cartan equations. As 2-term truncations we recover Roytenberg's
category of weak Lie 2-algebras. We prove a version of the homotopy transfer
theorem for weak Lie 3-algebras. A right homotopy inverse to the resolution is
constructed and leads to a skew-symmetrization construction from weak Lie
3-algebras to 3-term $\textrm{L}_\infty$-algebras. Finally, we give two
applications: the first is an extension of a result of Rogers comparing
algebraic structures related to $n$-plectic manifolds; the second is the
construction of a weak Lie 3-algebra associated to an CLWX 2-algebroid leading
to a new proof of a result of Liu--Sheng.

recombination reactions to study the spin-dependent charge recombination along
PTZ$^{\bullet+}$--Ph$_n$--PDI$^{\bullet-}$ molecular wires. By comparing our
results to the experimental data of E. Weiss {\em et al.} [J. Am. Chem. Soc.
{\bf 126}, 5577 (2004)], we are able to extract the spin-dependent (singlet and
triplet) charge recombination rate constants for wires with $n=2-5$. These
spin-dependent rate constants have not been extracted previously from the
experimental data because they require fitting its magnetic field-dependence to
the results of quantum spin dynamics simulations. We find that the triplet
recombination rate constant decreases exponentially with the length of the
wire, consistent with the superexchange mechanism of charge recombination.
However, the singlet recombination rate constant is nearly independent of the
length of the wire, suggesting that the singlet pathway is dominated by an
incoherent hopping mechanism. A simple qualitative explanation for the
different behaviours of the two spin-selective charge recombination pathways is
provided in terms of Marcus theory. We also find evidence for a magnetic
field-independent background contribution to the triplet yield of the charge
recombination reaction, and suggest several possible explanations for it. Since
none of these explanations is especially compelling given the available
experimental evidence, and since the result appears to apply more generally to
other molecular wires, we hope that this aspect of our study will stimulate
further experimental work.

Wolynes, J. Chem. Phys. 87, 6559 (1987)] is based on a saddle point
approximation to the time integral of a reactive flux autocorrelation function
in the nonadiabatic (golden rule) limit. The dominant saddle point is on the
imaginary time axis at $t_{\rm sp}=i\lambda_{\rm sp}\hbar$, and provided
$\lambda_{\rm sp}$ lies in the range $-\beta/2\le\lambda_{\rm sp}\le\beta/2$,
it is straightforward to evaluate the rate constant using information obtained
from an imaginary time path integral calculation. However, if $\lambda_{\rm
sp}$ lies outside this range, as it does in the Marcus inverted regime, the
path integral diverges. This has led to claims in the literature that Wolynes
theory cannot describe the correct behaviour in the inverted regime. Here we
show how the imaginary time correlation function obtained from a path integral
calculation can be analytically continued to $\lambda_{\rm sp}<-\beta/2$, and
the continuation used to evaluate the rate in the inverted regime. Comparisons
with exact golden rule results for a spin-boson model and a more demanding
(asymmetric and anharmonic) model of electronic predissociation show that the
theory it is just as accurate in the inverted regime as it is in the normal

to the expansion of the SN photosphere with time. We show that, owing to the
steep spectral index of the ISM density power spectrum, sizable density
fluctuation amplitudes at the length scale of typical ISM structures ($\gtrsim

non-uniform ISM, of absorption equivalent widths and of extinction, would be
small. As a result, we conclude that non-uniform ISM density should not impact

Additionally, sensitive upper limits were derived on the complex molecules
acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and formamide (NH2CHO) based on the average of the
strongest lines in the targeted spectral range to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio. Gas production rates are derived using a non-LTE molecular excitation

by far the deepest IFS observation with the highest spatial resolution ($\sim$
400 pc) on a spiral galaxy at a cosmic time when the Hubble sequence is about
to emerge. After correcting for a lensing magnification of 7.2 $\pm$ 0.8, this
primitive spiral disk has an intrinsic star formation rate of 22 $\pm$ 2
$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, a stellar mass of 10$^{9.8 \pm 0.3}$$M_{\odot}$ and a
half-light radius of $r_{1/2}=2.6 \pm 0.7$ kpc, typical of a main-sequence
star-forming (SF) galaxy at $z\sim2$. However, the H\alpha\ kinematics show a
surprisingly tranquil velocity field with an ordered rotation ($V_{\rm c}$ =
200 $\pm$ 12 km/s) and uniformly small velocity dispersions ($V_{\rm \sigma,
mean}$ = 23 $\pm$ 4 km/s and $V_{\rm \sigma, outer-disk}$ = 15 $\pm$ 2 km/s).
The low gas velocity dispersion is similar to local spiral galaxies and is
consistent with the classic density wave theory where spiral arms form in
dynamically cold and thin disks. We speculate that A1689B11 belongs to a
population of rare spiral galaxies at $z\gtrsim2$ that mark the formation epoch
of thin disks. Future observations with JWST will greatly increase the sample
of these rare galaxies and unveil the earliest onset of spiral arms.

identified in all prime HST datasets that include the HUDF09/12, the HUDF/XDF,
all the CANDELS fields, and now the HFF survey. Based on this comprehensive

magnitude from z~8 to z~10 at all luminosities over a four magnitude range.
This also implies a decrease of the cosmic star-formation rate density by an
order of magnitude within 170 Myr from z~8 to z~10. We show that this
accelerated evolution compared to lower redshift can entirely be explained by
the fast build-up of the dark matter halo mass function at z>8. Consequently,
the predicted UV LFs from several models of galaxy formation are in good
agreement with this observed trend, even though the measured UV LF lies at the
low end of model predictions. In particular, the number of only 9 observed
candidate galaxies is lower, by ~50%, than predicted by galaxy evolution
models. The difference is generally still consistent within the Poisson and
cosmic variance uncertainties. However, essentially all models predict larger
numbers than observed. We discuss the implications of these results in light of
the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope mission, which is poised to find much
larger samples of z~10 galaxies as well as their progenitors at less than 400

stellar components (MZRstar) of local star-forming galaxies based on a
representative sample from SDSS DR12. The mass-weighted average stellar
metallicities are systematically lower than the gas metallicities. This
difference in metallicity increases toward galaxies with lower masses and
reaches 0.4-0.8 dex at 10^9 Msun (depending on the gas metallicity
calibration). As a result, the MZRstar is much steeper than the MZRgas. The
much lower metallicities in stars compared to the gas in low mass galaxies
implies dramatic metallicity evolution with suppressed metal enrichment at
early times. The aim of this paper is to explain the observed large difference
in gas and stellar metallicity and to infer the origin of the mass-metallicity
relations. To this end we develop a galactic chemical evolution model
accounting for star formation, gas inflow and outflow. By combining the
observed mass-metallicity relation for both gas and stellar components to
constrain the models, we find that only two scenarios are able to reproduce the
observations. Either strong metal outflow or a steep IMF slope at early epochs
of galaxy evolution is needed. Based on these two scenarios, for the first time
we successfully reproduce the observed MZRgas and MZRstar simultaneously,
together with other independent observational constraints in the local

the high mass end leaving the MZRstar intact, as seen in observational data.

signals living in a sea of uninteresting (but usually dominant) noise. In many
contexts (i.e., stellar time-series, or high-contrast imaging, or stellar
spectroscopy), there are structured components in this noise caused by
systematic effects in the astronomical source, the atmosphere, the telescope,
or the detector. More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for
these nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many
(unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference. Sometimes,
housekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can be used as
predictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple functions of
these predictors are often used as computationally tractable models that can
capture the nuisances. These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics
prior to investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a
simultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that
if a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the
weights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which
can (often) be made fast. We illustrate this model by demonstrating the

two-dimensional toric code using the logarithmic entanglement negativity. We
are able to obtain exact results that give us insight into how thermal
excitations affect quantum entanglement. The toric code has two types of
elementary excitations (defects) costing different energies. We show that an
$O(1)$ density of the lower energy defect is required to degrade the
zero-temperature entanglement between two subsystems in contact with one
another. However, one type of excitation alone is not sufficient to kill all
quantum correlations, and an $O(1)$ density of the higher energy defect is
required to cause the so-called sudden death of the negativity. Interestingly,
if the energy cost of one of the excitations is taken to infinity, quantum
correlations survive up to arbitrarily high temperatures, a feature that is
likely shared with other quantum spin liquids and frustrated systems in
general, when projected down to their low-energy states. We demonstrate this
behaviour both for small subsystems, where we can prove that the negativity is
a necessary and sufficient condition for separability, as well as for extended
subsystems, where it is only a necessary condition. We further observe that the
negativity per boundary degree of freedom at a given temperature increases
(parametrically) with the size of the boundary, and that quantum correlations
between subsystems with extended boundaries are more robust to thermal
fluctuations.

are thought to form the transition between white dwarfs progenitors and core
collapse progenitors. The mass range for ECSN from close binary systems is
thought to be wider than the range for single stars, because of the effects of
mass transfer on the helium core. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we
explored the parameter space of initial primary masses between 8 $M_\odot$ and
17 $M_\odot$, using a large grid of models. We find that the initial primary
mass and the mass transfer evolution are important factors in the final fate of
stars in this mass range. Mass transfer due to Roche Lobe overflow during and
after carbon burning causes the core to cool down so that it avoids neon
ignition, even in helium-free cores with masses up to 1.52 $M_\odot$, which in
single stars would ignite neon. If the core is able to contract to high enough
densities for electron captures to commence, we find that, for the adopted
Ledoux convection criterion, the initial mass range for the primary to evolve
into an ECSN is between 13.5 $M_\odot$ and 17.6 $M_\odot$. The mass ratio,
initial period, and mass loss efficiency only marginally affect the predicted

galaxy M32. We compare our results to massive ETGs and available dynamical
measurements. We find that the GCs have stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L) that
are either consistent with a Kroupa IMF or are slightly bottom-light while the
UCD and cE have mildly elevated M/L. The separation in derived IMFs for systems
with similar metallicities and abundance patterns indicates that our SPS models
can distinguish abundance and IMF effects. Variation among the sample in this
paper is only $\sim 50\%$ in normalized M/L compared to the $\sim 4\times$
among the ETG sample. This suggests that metallicity is not the sole driver of
IMF variability and additional parameters need to be considered.

current lensing detections derived from HST, Keck, and ALMA. The addition of
full hydrodynamics reduces the overall subhalo mass function by about a factor
of two. Even for the dark matter only runs, most (~ 85%) lines of sight through
projected cylinders of size close to an Einstein radius contain no
substructures larger than 10^9 M_sun. The fraction of empty sight lines rises
to ~ 95% in full physics simulations. This suggests we will likely need
hundreds of strong lensing systems suitable for substructure studies, as well
as predictions that include the effects of baryon physics on substructure, to
properly constrain cosmological models. Fortunately, the field is poised to
fulfill these requirements.

more similar than if the system were assembled randomly from planets in the

intrinsic compositional scatter in the planet mass-radius relation is dominated
by system-to-system variance rather than intra-system variance. Second, if

the task environment allows quantum access. In addition, we impose certain

achieve exponential improvements in learning efficiency, surpassing previous
results that showed only quadratic improvements. A key step in the proof is to
construct task environments that encode well-known oracle problems, such as
Simon's problem and Recursive Fourier Sampling, while satisfying the above

quantum agents may perform well in certain game-playing scenarios, where the

used in a quantum optics formalism of the molecule-nanostructure interaction to
model the SERS spectrum. An intuitive methodology is presented for calculating
the single molecule enhancement factor (SMEF), which is also able to predict
known experimental SERS enhancement factors of an example gold nano-dimer. We
elucidate the important figures-of-merit of the enhancement and explore these
for different designs. We find that the use of hyperbolic stratified materials
can enhance the photonic local density of states (LDOS) by close to 2 times in
comparison to pure metal nanostructures, when both designed to work at the same
operating wavelengths. However, the increased LDOS is accompanied by higher
electric field concentration within the lossy hyperbolic material, which leads
to increased quenching that serves to reduce the overall detected SERS
enhancement in the far field. For nanoresonators with resonant localized
surface plasmon wavelengths in the near-infrared, the SMEF for the hyperbolic
stratified nanostructure is approximately an order of magnitude lower than the
pure metal counterpart. Conversely, we show that by detecting the Raman signal
using a near-field probe, hyperbolic materials can provide an improvement in
SERS enhancement compared to using pure metal nanostructures when the probe is
sufficiently close (<50 nm) to the Raman active molecule at the plasmonic

Boxiness in the equatorial plane is associated either with quasi-periodic

alternatively, can we use the entanglement entropy to detect the structure of

orders? We are mainly interested in (3+1)D topological orders that can be
realized in Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories, which are labeled by a finite
group $G$ and its group 4-cocycle $\omega\in\mathcal{H}^4[G;U(1)]$ up to group
automorphisms. We find that each topological excitation contributes a universal
constant $\ln d_i$ to the entanglement entropy, where $d_i$ is the quantum
dimension that depends on both the structure of the excitation and the data

Accepted to WSDM 2018",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic relation extraction (RE) for types of interest is of great
importance for interpreting massive text corpora in an efficient manner.
Traditional RE models have heavily relied on human-annotated corpus for
training, which can be costly in generating labeled data and become obstacles
when dealing with more relation types. Thus, more RE extraction systems have
shifted to be built upon training data automatically acquired by linking to
knowledge bases (distant supervision). However, due to the incompleteness of
knowledge bases and the context-agnostic labeling, the training data collected
via distant supervision (DS) can be very noisy. In recent years, as increasing
attention has been brought to tackling question-answering (QA) tasks, user
feedback or datasets of such tasks become more accessible. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, ReQuest, to leverage question-answer pairs as an
indirect source of supervision for relation extraction, and study how to use
such supervision to reduce noise induced from DS. Our model jointly embeds
relation mentions, types, QA entity mention pairs and text features in two
low-dimensional spaces (RE and QA), where objects with same relation types or
semantically similar question-answer pairs have similar representations. Shared
features connect these two spaces, carrying clearer semantic knowledge from
both sources. ReQuest, then use these learned embeddings to estimate the types
of test relation mentions. We formulate a global objective function and adopt a
novel margin-based QA loss to reduce noise in DS by exploiting semantic
evidence from the QA dataset. Our experimental results achieve an average of
11% improvement in F1 score on two public RE datasets combined with TREC QA
dataset.

other classes of regression models, it is desirable to perform diagnostic
analysis in generalized linear models using residuals that are approximately
standard normally distributed. Diagnostic analysis in this class of models are
usually performed using the standardized Pearson residual or the standardized
deviance residual. The former has skewed distribution and the latter has
negative mean, specially when the variance of the response variable is high. In
this work, we introduce the adjusted quantile residual for generalized linear

compare this residual with the standardized Pearson residual, the standardized

the adjusted quantile residual is a better tool for diagnostic analysis in

the Fano factor of periodic and quasi-periodic graphene superlattices. We
consider the continuum model and use the transfer matrix method to solve the
Dirac-like equation for graphene where the electrostatic potential, energy gap
and Fermi velocity are piecewise constant functions of the position x. We found
that in the presence of an energy gap, it is possible to tune the energy of the
Fano factor peak and consequently the location of the Dirac point, by a
modulations in the Fermi velocity. Hence, the peak of the Fano factor can be
used experimentally to identify the Dirac point. We show that for higher values
of the Fermi velocity the Fano factor goes below 1/3 in the Dirac point.
Furthermore, we show that in periodic superlattices the location of Fano factor
peaks is symmetric when the Fermi velocity $v_A$ and $v_B$ is exchanged,
however by introducing quasi-periodicity the symmetry is lost. The Fano factor
usually holds a universal value for a specific transport regime, which reveals
that the possibility of controlling it in graphene is a notable result.

Here we argue that under certain conditions cheating behaviour can be

the cost of the public goods, yet they receive the benefit. Although this
free-riding harms the entire population in the long run, the success of
cheaters may aid the population when there is a common enemy that antagonizes
both cooperators and cheaters. Here we study models in which an immune system
antagonizes a cooperating pathogen. We investigate three population dynamics
models, and determine under what conditions the presence of cheaters help
defeat the immune system. The mechanism of action is that a polymorphism of
cheaters and altruists optimizes the average growth rate. Our results give
support for a possible synergy between cooperators and cheaters in ecological

keep an object stable under changing external forces. We particularly focus on
the case where a human may be applying forceful operations, e.g. cutting or
drilling, on an object that the robot is holding. The planner produces an
efficient plan by intelligently deciding when the robot should change its grasp
on the object as the human applies the forces. The planner also tries to choose
subsequent grasps such that they will minimize the number of regrasps that will
be required in the long-term. Furthermore, as it switches from one grasp to the
other, the planner solves the problem of bimanual regrasp planning, where the
object is not placed on a support surface, but instead it is held by a single
gripper until the second gripper moves to a new position on the object. This
requires the planner to also reason about the stability of the object under
gravity.We provide an implementation on a bimanual robot and present
experiments to show the performance of our planner.

are now common at observatories. One of the main limitations to image quality
after wavefront correction comes from atmospheric refraction. An Atmospheric
dispersion compensator (ADC) is employed to correct for atmospheric refraction.
The correction is applied based on a look-up table consisting of dispersion
values as a function of telescope elevation angle. The look-up table based
correction of atmospheric dispersion results in imperfect compensation leading
to the presence of residual dispersion in the point-spread function (PSF) and
is insufficient when sub-milliarcsecond precision is required. The presence of
residual dispersion can limit the achievable contrast while employing
high-performance coronagraphs or can compromise high-precision astrometric
measurements. In this paper, we present the first on-sky closed-loop correction
of atmospheric dispersion by directly using science path images. The concept
behind the measurement of dispersion utilizes the chromatic scaling of focal
plane speckles. An adaptive speckle grid generated with a deformable mirror
(DM) that has a sufficiently large number of actuators is used to accurately
measure the residual dispersion and subsequently correct it by driving the ADC.
We have demonstrated with the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme AO (SCExAO) system
on-sky closed-loop correction of residual dispersion to < 1 mas across H-band.
This work will aid in the direct detection of habitable exoplanets with
upcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs) and also provide a diagnostic tool

such a random arrival model, we improve upon the $1/2$-approximation and obtain

the second leading cause in the United States. The risk of colorectal cancer
can be mitigated by the identification and removal of premalignant lesions
through optical colonoscopy. Unfortunately, conventional colonoscopy misses
more than 20% of the polyps that should be removed, due in part to poor
contrast of lesion topography. Imaging tissue topography during a colonoscopy
is difficult because of the size constraints of the endoscope and the deforming
mucosa. Most existing methods make geometric assumptions or incorporate a
priori information, which limits accuracy and sensitivity. In this paper, we
present a method that avoids these restrictions, using a joint deep
convolutional neural network-conditional random field (CNN-CRF) framework.
Estimated depth is used to reconstruct the topography of the surface of the
colon from a single image. We train the unary and pairwise potential functions
of a CRF in a CNN on synthetic data, generated by developing an endoscope
camera model and rendering over 100,000 images of an anatomically-realistic
colon. We validate our approach with real endoscopy images from a porcine
colon, transferred to a synthetic-like domain, with ground truth from
registered computed tomography measurements. The CNN-CRF approach estimates
depths with a relative error of 0.152 for synthetic endoscopy images and 0.242
for real endoscopy images. We show that the estimated depth maps can be used
for reconstructing the topography of the mucosa from conventional colonoscopy
images. This approach can easily be integrated into existing endoscopy systems
and provides a foundation for improving computer-aided detection algorithms for
detection, segmentation and classification of lesions.

that has attracted immense research in statistics. The Wald statistic is a
prime candidate for the task, on the grounds of the asymptotic validity of the
standard normal approximation to its finite-sample distribution, simplicity and
low computational cost. It is well known, though, that this normal
approximation can be inadequate, especially when the sample size is small or
moderate relative to the number of parameters. A novel, algebraic adjustment to
the Wald statistic is proposed, delivering significant improvements in
inferential performance with only small implementation and computational
overhead, predominantly due to additional matrix multiplications. The Wald
statistic is viewed as an estimate of a transformation of the model parameters
and is appropriately adjusted, using either maximum likelihood or reduced-bias
estimators, bringing its expectation asymptotically closer to zero. The
location adjustment depends on the expected information, an approximation to
the bias of the estimator, and the derivatives of the transformation, which are
all either readily available or easily obtainable in standard software for a
wealth of models. An algorithm for the implementation of the location-adjusted
Wald statistics in general models is provided, as well as a bootstrap scheme
for the further scale correction of the location-adjusted statistic. Ample
analytical and numerical evidence is presented for the adoption of the
location-adjusted statistic in prominent modelling settings, including
inference about log-odds and binomial proportions, logistic regression in the
presence of nuisance parameters, beta regression, and gamma regression. The
location-adjusted Wald statistics are used for the construction of significance
maps for the analysis of multiple sclerosis lesions from MRI data.

properties to understand its origin and the source(s) of the ionisation. The
MUSE data allow the identification of a dozen of group members embedded in this
structure from emission and absorption lines. We extracted spectra from small
apertures defined for both the diffuse ionised gas and the galaxies. We
investigated the kinematics and ionisation properties of the various galaxies
and extended gas regions thanks to line diagnostics (R23, O32 and
[OIII]/H\beta) available within the MUSE wavelength range. We compared these
diagnostics to photo-ionisation models and shock models. The structure is
divided in two kinematically distinct sub-structures. The most extended
sub-structure of ionised gas is likely rotating around a massive galaxy and
displays filamentary patterns linking some galaxies. The second sub-structure
links another massive galaxy hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus to a low mass
galaxy but also extends orthogonally to the AGN host disk over ~35 kpc. This
extent is likely ionised by the AGN itself. The location of small diffuse
regions in the R23 vs. O32 diagram is compatible with photo-ionisation.
However, the location of three of these regions in this diagram (low O32, high
R23) can also be explained by shocks, which is supported by their large
velocity dispersions. One edge-on galaxy shares the same properties and may be
a source of shocks. Whatever the hypothesis, the extended gas seems to be non
primordial. We favour a scenario where the gas has been extracted from galaxies
by tidal forces and AGN triggered by interactions between at least the two
sub-structures.

detecting the mass of quasiparticles with effective magnetic charge in solids.
Effective magnetic charges may be appear as defects in particular magnetic
textures. A magnetic monopole is a defect in this texture and as such these are
not monopoles in the actual magnetic field B, but instead in the auxiliary
field H. They may have particular properties expected for such quasiparticles
such as magnetic charge and mass. This effective mass may -- in principle -- be
detected in the same fashion that the mass is detected of other particles
classically e.g. through their inertial response to time-dependent
electromagnetic fields. I discuss this physics in the context of the ""simple""
case of the quantum spin ices, but aspects are broadly applicable. Based on
extensions to Ryzkhin's model for classical spin ice, a hydrodynamic
formulation can be given that takes into account inertial and entropic forces.
Ultimately, a form for the susceptibility is obtained that is equivalent to the
Rocard equation, which is a classic form used to account for inertial effects

The functional mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain largely unknown.
Experimental evidence suggests that some of the memory functions are performed
by stratified brain structures such as, e.g., the hippocampus. In this
particular case, single neurons in the CA1 region receive a highly
multidimensional input from the CA3 area, which is a hub for information
processing. We thus assess the implication of the abundance of neuronal
signalling routes converging onto single cells on the information processing.
We show that single neurons can selectively detect and learn arbitrary
information items, given that they operate in high dimensions. The argument is
based on Stochastic Separation Theorems and the concentration of measure
phenomena. We demonstrate that a simple enough functional neuronal model is
capable of explaining: i) the extreme selectivity of single neurons to the
information content, ii) simultaneous separation of several uncorrelated
stimuli or informational items from a large set, and iii) dynamic learning of
new items by associating them with already ""known"" ones. These results
constitute a basis for organization of complex memories in ensembles of single
neurons. Moreover, they show that no a priori assumptions on the structural

results in a single large network setting for the potentially nonparametric
homophily effect function, the realizations of unobserved individual fixed
effects and the unknown distribution of idiosyncratic pairwise shocks, up to
normalization, for each possible true value of the unknown parameters. We
propose a novel form of scale normalization on an arbitrary interquantile
range, which is not only theoretically robust but also proves particularly
convenient for the identification analysis, as quantiles provide direct
linkages between the observable conditional probabilities and the unknown index
values. We then use an inductive ""in-fill and out-expansion"" algorithm to
establish our main results, and consider extensions to more general settings
that allow nonseparable dependence between homophily and degree heterogeneity,
as well as certain extents of network sparsity and weaker assumptions on the
support of unobserved heterogeneity. As a byproduct, we also propose a concept
called ""modeling equivalence"" as a refinement of ""observational equivalence"",

TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with
$2.1$ $million$ genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and
validates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first
deep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers
TF-TF interactions for large-scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposed
architecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.

general theory of Chebyshev sets guarantees the existence of rules with a
Gaussian property, in the sense that $2l$ basis functions can be integrated
exactly with just $l$ points and weights. Moreover, all weights are positive
and the points lie inside the interval $[a,b]$. However, the points are not the
roots of an orthogonal polynomial or any other known special function as in the
case of regular Gaussian quadrature. The rules are characterized by a nonlinear
system of equations, and earlier numerical methods have mostly focused on
finding suitable starting values for a Newton iteration to solve this system.
In this paper we describe an alternative scheme that is robust and generally
applicable for so-called complete Chebyshev sets. These are ordered Chebyshev
sets where the first $k$ elements also form a Chebyshev set for each $k$. The
points of the quadrature rule are computed one by one, increasing exactness of
the rule in each step. Each step reduces to finding the unique root of a
univariate and monotonic function. As such, the scheme of this paper is
guaranteed to succeed. The quadrature rules are of interest for integrals with

observations such as images, is exceptionally challenging. Real-world events
can be stochastic and unpredictable, and the high dimensionality and complexity
of natural images requires the predictive model to build an intricate
understanding of the natural world. Many existing methods tackle this problem
by making simplifying assumptions about the environment. One common assumption
is that the outcome is deterministic and there is only one plausible future.
This can lead to low-quality predictions in real-world settings with stochastic
dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic variational video prediction
(SV2P) method that predicts a different possible future for each sample of its
latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to
provide effective stochastic multi-frame prediction for real-world video. We
demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in predicting detailed future
frames of videos on multiple real-world datasets, both action-free and
action-conditioned. We find that our proposed method produces substantially
improved video predictions when compared to the same model without
stochasticity, and to other stochastic video prediction methods. Our SV2P
implementation will be open sourced upon publication.

Unlike other variance reduction techniques that either require additional

increase the sample size is governed by an inner product test that ensures that
search directions are descent directions with high probability. We show that
the inner product test improves upon the well known norm test, and can be used

and a significant fraction of users exercise this right to be forgotten.
However, ironically, users' attempt to reduce attention to sensitive posts via
deletion, in practice, attracts unwanted attention from stalkers specifically
to those posts. Thus, deletions may leave users more vulnerable to attacks on
their privacy in general. Users hoping to make their posts forgotten face a
""damned if I do, damned if I don't"" dilemma. Many are shifting towards
ephemeral social platform like Snapchat, which will deprive us of important
user-data archival. In the form of intermittent withdrawals, we present, Lethe,
a novel solution to this problem of forgetting the forgotten. If the
next-generation social platforms are willing to give up the uninterrupted
availability of non-deleted posts by a very small fraction, Lethe provides
privacy to the deleted posts over long durations. In presence of Lethe, an
adversarial observer becomes unsure if some posts are permanently deleted or
just temporarily withdrawn by Lethe; at the same time, the adversarial observer
is overwhelmed by a large number of falsely flagged undeleted posts. To
demonstrate the feasibility and performance of Lethe, we analyze large-scale
real data about users' deletion over Twitter and thoroughly investigate how to
choose time duration distributions for alternating between temporary
withdrawals and resurrections of non-deleted posts. We find a favorable
trade-off between privacy, availability and adversarial overhead in different
settings for users exercising their right to delete. We show that, even against
an ultimate adversary with an uninterrupted access to the entire platform,
Lethe offers deletion privacy for up to 3 months from the time of deletion,
while maintaining content availability as high as 95% and keeping the
adversarial precision to 20%.

which functions produce the best results overall. Based on this first set of
results, we examine the effects of building deeper architectures with an
increasing number of hidden layers. We also survey the impact of using, on the

optimal neural network architecture that yields impressive results in accuracy

dwarfs. HD 203030B offered the first clear indication that the effective
temperature at the L-to-T spectral type transition depends on surface gravity:
now a well-known characteristic of low-gravity ultra-cool dwarfs. An initial
age analysis of the G8V primary star indicated that the system was 130--400 Myr
old, and so the companion between 12--31 $M_{\rm Jup}$. Using moderate
resolution near-infrared spectra of HD 203030B, we now find features of very
low gravity comparable to those of 10--150 Myr-old L7--L8 dwarfs. We also
obtained more accurate near infrared and {\sl Spitzer}/IRAC photometry, and
find a $(J-K)_{\rm MKO}$ color of $2.56\pm0.13$ mag---comparable to those
observed in other young planetary-mass objects---and a luminosity of
log($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot}$)$\,=\,-4.75\pm0.04$ dex. We further reassess the
evidence for the young age of the host star, HD 203030, with a more
comprehensive analysis of the photometry and updated stellar activity
measurements and age calibrations. Summarizing the age diagnostics for both
components of the binary, we adopt an age of 100 Myr for HD 203030B and an age
range of 30--150 Myr. Using cloudy evolutionary models, the new companion age
range and luminosity result in a mass of 11 $M_{\rm Jup}$ with a range of 8--15
$M_{\rm Jup}$, and an effective temperature of $1040\pm50$ K.

neural nets with ReLU activations. Specifically, we answer the following
question: for a fixed $d_{in}\geq 1,$ what is the minimal width $w$ so that
neural nets with ReLU activations, input dimension $d_{in}$, hidden layer
widths at most $w,$ and arbitrary depth can approximate any continuous,
real-valued function of $d_{in}$ variables arbitrarily well? It turns out that
this minimal width is exactly equal to $d_{in}+1.$ That is, if all the hidden
layer widths are bounded by $d_{in}$, then even in the infinite depth limit,
ReLU nets can only express a very limited class of functions, and, on the other
hand, any continuous function on the $d_{in}$-dimensional unit cube can be
approximated to arbitrary precision by ReLU nets in which all hidden layers
have width exactly $d_{in}+1.$ Our construction in fact shows that any
continuous function $f:[0,1]^{d_{in}}\to\mathbb R^{d_{out}}$ can be
approximated by a net of width $d_{in}+d_{out}$. We obtain quantitative depth
estimates for such an approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity of
$f$.

the persistence (beyond a certain regime) of the cell groups. This suggests
that synaptic transience, or forgetting, is a mechanism by which the brain
counteracts the effects of spurious place cell activity.

opportunity for enabling users to better monitor transportation network
conditions and make better operating decisions to improve safety and reduce
pollution, energy consumption, and travel delays. This paper investigates the
implications of optimally coordinating vehicles that are wirelessly connected
to each other in roundabouts to achieve a smooth traffic flow. We apply an
optimization framework and an analytical solution that allows optimal
coordination of vehicles for merging in such traffic scenario. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation and it
is shown that fully coordinated vehicles reduce total travel time by 51% and
fuel consumption by 35%. Furthermore, we study the influence of vehicle
coordination in a mixed-traffic environment and compare the network performance
under different market penetration rates of connected and automated vehicles
(CAVs). For this particular study with near-capacity demand, due to extremely
unstable traffic, the results show that even with high penetration of CAVs
(e.g., 80%), travel time and fuel savings are much less than a network of CAVs.

for high dimensional multilinear arrays or tensors. More specifically, we
propose a novel tensor sparsification algorithm that retains a subset of the
entries of a tensor in a judicious way, and prove that it can attain a given
level of approximation accuracy in terms of tensor spectral norm with a much
smaller sample complexity when compared with existing approaches. In
particular, we show that for a $k$th order $d\times\cdots\times d$ cubic tensor
of {\it stable rank} $r_s$, the sample size requirement for achieving a
relative error $\varepsilon$ is, up to a logarithmic factor, of the order
$r_s^{1/2} d^{k/2} /\varepsilon$ when $\varepsilon$ is relatively large, and
$r_s d /\varepsilon^2$ and essentially optimal when $\varepsilon$ is
sufficiently small. It is especially noteworthy that the sample size
requirement for achieving a high accuracy is of an order independent of $k$. To
further demonstrate the utility of our techniques, we also study how higher
order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of large tensors can be efficiently
approximated via sparsification.

  Dots with High Stability","5 pages, 4 figure",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphene is a nonmagnetic semimetal and cannot be directly used as electronic
or spintronic devices. We demonstrate that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can
exhibit strong edge magnetism and tunable energy gaps due to the presence of
localized edge states. By using large-scale first principle density functional
theory (DFT) calculations and detailed analysis based on model Hamiltonians, we
can show that the zigzag edge states in GQDs become much stronger and more
localized as the system size increases. The enhanced edge states induce strong
electron-electron interactions along the edges of GQDs, ultimately resulting in
a magnetic phase transition from nonmagnetic to intra-edge ferromagnetic and
inter-edge antiferromagnetic, when the diameter is larger than 4.5 nm. Our
analysis shows that the inter-edge superexchange interaction of
antiferromagnetic states between two nearest-neighbor zigzag edges in GQDs is
much stronger than that exists between two parallel zigzag edges in GQDs and
graphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, such strong and localized edge states also
induce GQDs semiconducting with tunable energy gaps, mainly controlled by
adjusting the system size. Our results show that the quantum confinement
effect, inter-edge superexchange (antiferromagnetic), and intra-edge direct
exchange (ferromagnetic) interactions are crucial for the electronic and
magnetic properties of zigzag GQDs at the nanoscale.

engineering disciplines over the decades. A number of studies in the field have
been focused on finding the common properties among different kinds of networks
such as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and modular structure
and they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complex
networks. However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure across
a diverse set of domains in order to explain the structural diversity we
observe in the real-world networks. In this paper, we study 986 real-world
networks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online social
networks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models.
Our study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random
forest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among network
domains in terms of network structure. Our results indicate that there are some
partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish
based purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of
network categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints
and/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same
partition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of
engineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network,
whether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be a
decisive factor of the formation of similar network structure. Our findings
shed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hidden
principles for the structural diversity of complex networks.

codes. First we define a kind of innovation corresponding to the received data,
i.e., the input to a Viterbi decoder. Then the structure of a
Scarce-State-Transition (SST) Viterbi decoder is derived in a natural manner.
It is shown that the newly defined innovation is just the input to the main
decoder in an SST Viterbi decoder and generates the same syndrome as the
original received data does. A similar result holds for Quick-Look-In (QLI)
codes as well. In this case, however, the precise innovation is not defined. We
see that this innovation-like quantity is related to the linear smoothed
estimate of the information. The essence of innovations approach to a linear
filtering problem is first to whiten the observed data, and then to treat the
resulting simpler white-noise observations problem. In our case, this
corresponds to the reduction of decoding complexity in the main decoder in an
SST Viterbi decoder. We show the distributions related to the main decoder
(i.e., the input distribution and the state distribution in the code trellis
for the main decoder) are much biased under moderately noisy conditions. We see
that these biased distributions actually lead to the complexity reduction in
the main decoder. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed innovations
approach can be extended to maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of block codes as
well.

BCG+ICL become bluer with increasing radius out to 53-100 kpc for all but one
system, suggesting that violent relaxation after major mergers with the BCG
cannot be the dominant source of ICL. For clusters the BCG+ICL luminosity at
r$<$100 kpc (0.08-0.13 r$_{500,c}$) is 1.2-3.5$\times 10^{12}$L$_\odot$; for
the groups, BCG+ICL luminosities within 100 kpc (0.17-0.23 r$_{500,c}$) range
between 0.7-1.3$\times 10^{12}$ L$_\odot$. The BCG+ICL stellar mass in the
inner 100 kpc increases with total cluster mass as
M$_\bigstar\propto$M$_{500,c}$$^{0.37\pm0.05}$. This steep slope implies that
the BCG+ICL is a higher fraction of the total mass in groups than in clusters.
The BCG+ICL luminosities and stellar masses are too large for the ICL stars to
come from the dissolution of dwarf galaxies alone, implying instead that the
ICL grows from the stripping of more massive galaxies. Using the colors of
cluster members from the CLASH sample, we place conservative lower limits on
the luminosities of galaxies from which the ICL could originate. We find that
at 10 kpc the ICL has a color similar to massive, passive cluster galaxies
($>10^{11.6}$ M$_\odot$), while by 100 kpc this colour is equivalent to that of
a 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ galaxy. Additionally, we find 75% of the total BCG+ICL
luminosity is consistent in color of galaxies with L$>$0.2 L$_*$
(log(M$_\bigstar$[M$_\odot$])$>$10.4), assuming conservatively that these
galaxies are completely disrupted. We conclude that tidal stripping of massive
galaxies is the likely source of the intracluster light from 10-100 kpc
(0.008-0.23 r$_{500,c}$) for galaxy groups and clusters.

at the fastest possible rate of $O(1/M+1/N)$ where $M,N$ are the sample sizes
of the respective populations. We illustrate the proposed WNN meta estimator
for several simulated and real data sets.

the joint distribution of extracted features and target F0 can be characterized
by training a bank of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) on artificial data

generate a set of conditional distributions on the predicted F0, which are then

paradigm. For two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 98922 (B9e) and V1295 Aql (A2e), we
have gathered multi-epoch (~years) and high-cadence (~minutes) high-resolution
optical spectra to probe a wide range of kinematic processes. Employing a line
equivalent width evolution correlation metric introduced here, we identify
species co-evolving (indicative of common line origin) via novel visualization.
We interferometrically constrain often problematically degenerate parameters,
inclination and inner disk radius, allowing us to focus on the structure of the
wind, magnetosphere, and inner gaseous disk in radiative transfer models. Over
all timescales sampled, the strongest variability occurs within the blueshifted
absorption components of the Balmer series lines; the strength of variability
increases with the cadence of the observations. Finally, high-resolution
spectra allow us to probe substructure within the Balmer series' blueshifted
absorption components: we observe static, low-velocity features and
time-evolving features at higher velocities. Overall, we find the observed line
morphologies and variability are inconsistent with a scaled-up T Tauri MA
scenario. We suggest that as magnetic field structure and strength change
dramatically with increasing stellar mass from T Tauri to Herbig Ae/Be stars,
so too may accretion and outflow processes.

underlying mechanism remains unclear. Neural networks associate similar inputs
in the visible layer to the same state of hidden variables in deep layers. The
fraction of inputs that are associated to the same state is a natural measure
of similarity and is simply related to the cost in bits required to represent
these inputs. The degeneracy of states with the same information cost provides
instead a natural measure of noise and is simply related the entropy of the
frequency of states, that we call relevance. Representations with minimal
noise, at a given level of similarity (resolution), are those that maximise the
relevance. A signature of such efficient representations is that frequency
distributions follow power laws. We show, in extensive numerical experiments,
that deep neural networks extract a hierarchy of efficient representations from
data, because they i) achieve low levels of noise (i.e. high relevance) and ii)
exhibit power law distributions. We also find that the layer that is most
efficient to reliably generate patterns of training data is the one for which
relevance and resolution are traded at the same price, which implies that
frequency distribution follows Zipf's law.

flares: $\tau \propto E^{0.2-0.33}$. This indicates a universal mechanism of
energy release on solar and stellar flares, i.e., magnetic reconnection. We
here carried out a statistical research on 50 solar WLFs observed with
\textit{SDO}/HMI and examined the correlation between the energies and
durations. As a result, the $E$--$\tau$ relation on solar WLFs ($\tau \propto
E^{0.38}$) is quite similar to that on stellar superflares ($\tau \propto
E^{0.39}$). However, the durations of stellar superflares are one order of
magnitude shorter than those expected from solar WLFs. We present the following
two interpretations for the discrepancy. (1) In solar flares, the cooling
timescale of WLFs may be longer than the reconnection one, and the decay time
of solar WLFs can be elongated by the cooling effect. (2) The distribution can
be understood by applying a scaling law ($\tau \propto E^{1/3}B^{-5/3}$)
derived from the magnetic reconnection theory. In this case, the observed
superflares are expected to have 2-4 times stronger magnetic field strength
than solar flares.

star formation history to two processes -- firstly, chaotic clump accretion and
major mergers, resulting in the early-time formation of bulges and secondly,
cold gas accretion, resulting in late-time disc formation. Under the assumption
of a Universal Chabrier initial mass function, we combine the Bruzual & Charlot
(2003) stellar libraries, the Charlot & Fall (2000) dust attenuation
prescription and template spectra for emission by dust and active galactic
nuclei to predict the CSED -- pre- and post-dust attenuation -- and the IGL
throughout cosmic time. The phenomological model, as constructed, adopts a
number of basic axioms and empirical results and has minimal free parameters.
We compare the model output, as well as predictions from the semi-analytic
model GALFORM to recent estimates of the CSED out to $z=1$. By construction,
our empirical model reproduces the full energy output of the Universe from the
ultraviolet to the far-infrared extremely well. We use the model to derive
predictions of the stellar and dust mass densities, again finding good
agreement. We find that GALFORM predicts the CSED for $z < 0.3$ in good
agreement with the observations. This agreement becomes increasingly poor
towards $z = 1$, when the model CSED is $\sim$50 per cent fainter. The latter
is consistent with the model underpredicting the cosmic star formation history.
As a consequence, GALFORM predicts a $\sim$30 per cent fainter IGL.

have designed and fabricated a dual-purpose superconducting circuit to
facilitate the next generation of astronomical observations in this regime by
providing proof-of-concept for both a millimeter-wave low-loss phase shifter,
which can operate as an on-chip Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and a
traveling wave kinetic inductance parametric amplifier (TKIP). Superconducting
transmission lines have a propagation speed that depends on the inductance in
the line which is a combination of geometric inductance and kinetic inductance
in the superconductor. The kinetic inductance has a non-linear component with a
characteristic current, $I_*$, and can be modulated by applying a DC current,
changing the propagation speed and effective path length. Our test circuit is
designed to measure the path length difference or phase shift, $\Delta \phi$,
between two symmetric transmission lines when one line is biased with a DC
current. To provide a measurement of $\Delta\phi$, a key parameter for
optimizing a high gain W-Band TKIP, and modulate signal path length in FTS
operation, our $3.6 \times 2.5\; \mathrm{cm}$ chip employs a pair of $503\;
\mathrm{mm}$ long NbTiN inverted microstrip lines coupled to circular waveguide
ports through radial probes. For a line of width $3\; \mathrm{\mu m}$ and film
thickness $20\; \mathrm{nm}$, we predict $\Delta\phi\approx1767\; \mathrm{rad}$
at $90\; \mathrm{GHz}$ when biased at close to $I_*$. We have fabricated a
prototype with $200\; \mathrm{nm}$ thick Nb film and the same line length and
width. The predicted phase shift for our prototype is $\Delta\phi\approx30\;

The information contained in a calibration model about the spatial and spectral
structure of an extended source is incomplete because a radio telescope cannot
sample all Fourier components. Application of an incomplete sky model to
calibration of EoR data will imprint residual error in the data, which
propagates forward to the EoR power spectrum. This limited information is
studied in the context of current and future planned instruments and surveys at
EoR frequencies, such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave

non-equilibrium steady state follows a symmetry relation called the fluctuation
theorem. When a certain part of the system is masked or hidden, it is difficult
to infer the exact estimate of the total entropy production. Entropy produced
from the observed part of the system shows a significant deviation from the
steady state fluctuation theorem. This deviation occurs due to the interaction
between the observed and the masked part of the system. A naive guess would be
that the deviation from the steady state fluctuation theorem may disappear in
the limit of small interaction between both parts of the system. In contrast,
we investigate the entropy production of a particle in a harmonically coupled
Brownian particle system (say, particle A and B) in a heat reservoir at a
constant temperature. The system is maintained in the non-equilibrium steady
state using stochastic driving. When the coupling between particle A and B is
infinitesimally weak, the deviation from the steady state fluctuation theorem
for the entropy production of a partial system of a coupled system is studied.
Furthermore, we consider a harmonically confined system (i.e., a harmonically
coupled system of particle A and B in harmonic confinement). In the weak
coupling limit, the entropy produced by the partial system (e.g., particle A)
of the coupled system in a harmonic trap satisfies the steady state fluctuation
theorem. Numerical simulations are performed to support the analytical results.

functions are constant for orbits within a range of eccentricities (e) and zero
outside this range. The linear normal modes of waterbags are composed of
sinusoidal disturbances of the edges of distribution function in phase space.
Waterbags which include circular orbits (polarcaps) have one stable linear
normal mode for each azimuthal wavenumber m. The m = 1 mode always has positive
pattern speed and, for polarcaps consisting of orbits with e < 0.9428, only the
m = 1 mode has positive pattern speed. Waterbags excluding circular orbits

unstable to modes with a wide range in m. Numerical simulations confirm linear

coarse-graining to open Markov processes. An ""open"" Markov process is one where
probability can flow in or out of certain states called ""inputs"" and ""outputs"".
One can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two
basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov
process with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov
processes side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author
showed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms
of a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a
symmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms are ways of
coarse-graining open Markov processes. We also extend the already known
""black-boxing"" functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double
category. Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation
between input and output data that holds in steady states, including
nonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability
through the process. To extend black-boxing to a functor between double
categories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with
coarse-graining.

a conversation context, whose challenges include how to recognize important
parts of the context, and how to model the relationships among utterances in
the context. Existing matching methods may lose important information in
contexts as we can interpret them with a unified framework in which contexts
are transformed to fixed-length vectors without any interaction with responses
before matching. The analysis motivates us to propose a new matching framework
that can sufficiently carry the important information in contexts to matching
and model the relationships among utterances at the same time. The new
framework, which we call a sequential matching framework (SMF), lets each
utterance in a context interacts with a response candidate at the first step
and transforms the pair to a matching vector. The matching vectors are then
accumulated following the order of the utterances in the context with a
recurrent neural network (RNN) which models the relationships among the
utterances. The context-response matching is finally calculated with the hidden
states of the RNN. Under SMF, we propose a sequential convolutional network and
sequential attention network and conduct experiments on two public data sets to
test their performance. Experimental results show that both models can
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art matching methods. We also show
that the models are interpretable with visualizations that provide us insights
on how they capture and leverage the important information in contexts for

recognize individual activity. Finally, we discover the overall crowd behavior
by classifying a crowd video in one of the eight categories. Since the crowd

Although steering has been demonstrated in a number of experiments involving

strong that QED effects already play a significant role for the $\gamma-$ray

far, insulating magnets in the low-spin $d^5$ electron configuration under the
strong spin-orbit coupling have been studied for realizing the Kitaev-type
bond-dependent anisotropic interactions between the spin-orbital entangled
Kramers doublets. To extend the candidates, here we investigate the systems in

the spin-orbital entangled Kramers doublet. By the second- order perturbation
in terms of the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ and $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hoppings, we show that the
effective spin model possesses the anisotropic Kitaev interactions as well as
the isotropic Heisenberg ones. While the Kitaev interaction is always
ferromagnetic, the Heisenberg interaction can become either ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic depending on the Coulomb interactions and the crystalline
electric fields. We also derive the effective model for the low-spin $d^5$
electron configuration within the same perturbation scheme, in which the Kitaev
interaction becomes both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, while the
Heisenberg one always ferromagnetic. Referring to the previous study for the
Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that the quantum spin liquid phase exists in
the reasonable parameter region in both $d^7$ and $d^5$ cases, while the former
has a richer structure of the phase diagram. We discuss the advantages of the

be trapped by corotation or a Lindblad resonance than thin-disc orbits.
Perturbation theory is used to create non-axisymmetric orbital tori from
standard axisymmetric tori, and both trapped and untrapped orbits are recovered
to surprising accuracy. Code is added to the TorusModeller library that makes
it as easy to manipulate non-axisymmetric tori as axisymmetric ones. The
augmented TorusModeller is used to compute the velocity structure of the solar

out as co-moving with any of the dozen nearest systems, i.e. it does not appear
to be associated with any local exo-Oort clouds (most notably that of the Alpha
Centauri triple system). 'Oumuamua's velocity is within 5 km/s of the median
Galactic velocity of the stars in the solar neighborhood (<25 pc), and within 2
km/s of the mean velocity of the local M dwarfs. Its velocity appears to be

Galactic velocity distribution of the local stars (i.e. less than 1 in 500

motion), 'Oumuamua is remarkable for showing both negligible radial (U) and

(V; by ~11 km/s). These calculations strengthen the interpretation that A/2017
U1 has a distant extrasolar origin, but not among the very nearest stars. Any

high carrier mobility (up to ~3,700 cm^2V^-1s^-1) even at room temperature,

generalization of dilation theory for a single contraction to a pair of
commuting contractions acting on a Hilbert space. While there are two explicit
constructions (Sch\""affer \cite{sfr} and Douglas \cite{Doug-Dilation}) of the
minimal isometric dilation of a single contraction, there was no such explicit
construction of an And\^o dilation for a commuting pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of
contractions, except in some special cases \cite{A-M-Dist-Var, D-S, D-S-S}. In
this paper, we give two new proofs of And\^o's dilation theorem by giving both
Sch\""affer-type and Douglas-type explicit constructions of an And\^o dilation
with function-theoretic interpretation, for the general case. The results, in
particular, give a complete description of all possible factorizations of a
given contraction $T$ into the product of two commuting contractions. Unlike
the one-variable case, two minimal And\^o dilations need not be unitarily
equivalent. However, we show that the compressions of the two And\^o dilations
constructed in this paper to the minimal dilation spaces of the contraction
$T_1T_2$, are unitarily equivalent.
  In the special case when the product $T=T_1T_2$ is pure, i.e., if $T^{* n}\to
0$ strongly, an And\^o dilation was constructed recently in \cite{D-S-S},
which, as this paper will show, is a corollary to the Douglas-type
construction.
  We define a notion of characteristic triple for a pair of commuting
contractions and a notion of coincidence for such triples. We prove that two
pairs of commuting contractions with their products being pure contractions are
unitarily equivalent if and only if their characteristic triples coincide. We
also characterize triples which qualify as the characteristic triple for some
pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of commuting contractions such that $T_1T_2$ is a pure
contraction.

A scheme designed for this purpose is called a private information retrieval

both desired for PIR schemes, because the former implies the highest download
rate and the latter usually means simple realization.
  For general values of $N,T,M$, the only known capacity-achieving PIR scheme

These are a class of non-stationary systems that model situations where the
dynamics change very slowly over time due to external influence. We focus on
the case where the time-evolution is described by intermittent interval maps
(Pomeau-Manneville maps) with time-dependent parameters. In a suitable range of
parameters, we obtain a description of the statistical properties as a
stochastic diffusion, by solving a well-posed martingale problem. The results
extend those of a related recent study due to Dobbs and Stenlund, which
concerned the case of quasistatic (uniformly) expanding systems.

Here we describe a laboratory experiment dedicated to probe the statistical

interacting gravity waves in the Coriolis facility (13~m diameter circular wave
tank) by exciting waves at 1~Hz by wedge wavemakers. We implement a
stereoscopic technique to obtain a measurement of the surface elevation that is
resolved both in space and time. Fourier analysis shows that the laboratory
spectra are systematically steeper than the theoretical predictions and than
the field observations in the Black Sea by Leckler {\it et al. JPO} 2015. We
identify a strong impact of surface dissipation on the scaling of the Fourier
spectrum at the scales that are accessible in the experiments. We use
bicoherence and tricoherence statistical tools in frequency and/or wavevector
space to identify the active nonlinear coupling. These analyses are also
performed on the field data by Leckler {\it et al.} for comparison with the
laboratory data. 3-wave coupling are characterized and shown to involve mostly
quasi resonances of waves with second or higher order harmonics. 4-wave
coupling are not observed in the laboratory but are evidenced in the field
data. We finally discuss temporal scale separation to explain our observations.

that nonadiabatic charge transfer effects can be accurately and seamlessly
described within a density functional framework. In alkali halides like LiF,
there is an abrupt change in the ground state electronic distribution due to an
electron transfer at a critical bond length $R=R_c$, where a barely avoided
crossing of the lowest adiabatic potential energy surfaces calls the validity
of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation into doubt. Modeling the $R$-dependent
electronic structure of LiF within a two-site Hubbard model, we find that
nonadiabatic electron-nuclear coupling produces a sizable elongation of the
critical $R_c$ by 0.5 Bohr. This effect is very accurately captured by a simple
and rigorously-derived correction, with an $M^{-1}$ prefactor, to the
exchange-correlation potential in density functional theory; $M=$ reduced
nuclear mass. Since this nonadiabatic term depends on gradients of the nuclear
wavefunction and conditional electronic density, $\nabla_R \chi(R)$ and
$\nabla_R n(\mathbf{r},R)$, it couples the Kohn-Sham equations at neighboring
$R$ points. Motivated by an observed localization of nonadiabatic effects in
nuclear configuration space, we propose a local conditional density
approximation -- an approximation that reduces the search for nonadiabatic

framework for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of open classical
mechanical systems. The morphisms of $\mathsf{LagSy}$ and $\mathsf{HamSy}$
correspond to such open systems, and composition of morphisms models the
construction of systems from subsystems. The Legendre transformation gives rise
to a functor from $\mathsf{LagSy}$ to $\mathsf{HamSy}$ that translates from the
Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian perspective.

coronagraph installed in the near-infrared camera and spectrograph NIRC2 at the
Keck II telescope, with the aim of unveiling the nature of the spiral structure
by constraining the presence of planetary companions in the system. Our
high-contrast imaging observations show a bright (delta L=7.0+/-0.3 mag)
point-like emission, south of MWC 758 at a deprojected separation of about 20
au (r=0.111+/- 0. 004 arcsec) from the central star. We also recover the two
spiral arms (south-east and north-west), already imaged by previous studies in
polarized light, and discover a third one to the south-west of the star. No
additional companions were detected in the system down to 5 Jupiter masses
beyond 0.6 arcsec from the star. We propose that the bright L band emission
could be caused by the presence of an embedded and accreting protoplanet,
although the possibility of it being an asymmetric disk feature cannot be
excluded. The spiral structure is probably not related to the protoplanet
candidate, unless on an inclined and eccentric orbit, and it could be due to
one (or more) yet undetected planetary companions at the edge of or outside the
spiral pattern. Future observations and additional simulations will be needed
to shed light on the true nature of the point-like source and its link with the
spiral arms.

The main purpose of the present paper is to establish that for both gauges this
also holds true for data $\Phi(0)$ in Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with less

consists in demonstrating that any solution in the natural solution space for

uncoordinated, which often leads to inefficient use of resources and poor

decentralized mechanisms to enable Spatial Reuse (SR). In particular, we focus
on dynamic channel selection and Transmission Power Control (TPC). We rely on
Reinforcement Learning (RL), and more specifically on Multi-Armed Bandits
(MABs), to allow networks to learn their best configuration. In this work, we
study the exploration-exploitation trade-off by means of the
$\varepsilon$-greedy, EXP3, UCB and Thompson sampling action-selection, and
compare their performance. In addition, we study the implications of selecting
actions simultaneously in an adversarial setting (i.e., concurrently), and
compare it with a sequential approach. Our results show that optimal
proportional fairness can be achieved, even when no information about
neighboring networks is available to the learners and Wireless Networks (WNs)
operate selfishly. However, there is high temporal variability in the
throughput experienced by the individual networks, specially for
$\varepsilon$-greedy and EXP3. These strategies, contrary to UCB and Thompson
sampling, base their operation on the absolute experienced reward, rather than
on its distribution. We identify the cause of this variability to be the
adversarial setting of our setup in which the set of most played actions
provide intermittent good/poor performance depending on the neighboring
decisions. We also show that learning sequentially, even if using a selfish
strategy, contributes to minimize this variability. The sequential approach is
therefore shown to effectively deal with the challenges posed by the
adversarial settings that are typically found in decentralized WNs.

laser induced periodic surface structures. We have shown that for high loss
metals the switching mechanism between normal and anomalous modes relays on an
interplay between two different feedbacks inherent into the structure formation
process: long range, low intensity dipole-like scattering of light along the
surface, which governs anomalous ripples parallel to the laser polarization,
and short range, high intensity plasmon-polariton wave, which is initiated by
near field dipole radiation and responsible for creation of ripples
perpendicular to the polarization, i. e. normal structure. By managing these
two feedbacks, we demonstrated creation of both normal and anomalous laser
induced periodic surface structures on the same surface. In contrast to the
previous studies, we have shown that the thermal oxidation mechanism can form
both normal and anomalous types of the structure, while the ablation mechanism
is involved only during the normal structure formation. Unlike the formation of
oxidation type anomalous structure, the formation of ablation type normal
structure does not have inherent negative feedback, which is self-regulating
nano-ripples formation. This feedback needs to be applied artificially, by
regulating scanning speed and pulse energy at a given repetition rate of the
laser. With implementation of nonlinear laser lithography technique for
ablation type of normal laser induced periodic surface structures we
demonstrated large area high regular nano-grating formation on different
surfaces with extremely high industrially acceptable speed.

AGB stars. However, the main gas-phase precursors leading to the formation of
SiC dust have not yet been identified. The most obvious candidates among the
molecules containing an Si--C bond detected in C-rich AGB stars are SiC2, SiC,
and Si2C. We aim to study how widespread and abundant SiC2, SiC, and Si2C are
in envelopes around C-rich AGB stars and whether or not these species play an
active role as gas-phase precursors of silicon carbide dust in the ejecta of
carbon stars. We carried out sensitive observations with the IRAM 30m telescope
of a sample of 25 C-rich AGB stars to search for emission lines of SiC2, SiC,
and Si2C in the 2 mm band. We performed non-LTE excitation and radiative
transfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of
SiC2 and to derive SiC2 fractional abundances in the observed envelopes. We
detect SiC2 in most of the sources, SiC in about half of them, and do not
detect Si2C in any source, at the exception of IRC +10216. Most of these
detections are reported for the first time in this work. We find a positive
correlation between the SiC and SiC2 line emission, which suggests that both
species are chemically linked, the SiC radical probably being the
photodissociation product of SiC2 in the external layer of the envelope. We
find a clear trend in which the denser the envelope, the less abundant SiC2 is.
The observed trend is interpreted as an evidence of efficient incorporation of
SiC2 onto dust grains, a process which is favored at high densities owing to
the higher rate at which collisions between particles take place. The observed
behavior of a decline in the SiC2 abundance with increasing density strongly
suggests that SiC2 is an important gas-phase precursor of SiC dust in envelopes
around carbon stars.

different regions and links stand for statistical interactions between their
activities as recorded by different neuroimaging techniques. Empirical studies
have lead to the hypothesis that brain functions rely on the coordination of a
scattered mosaic of functionally specialized brain regions (modules or
sub-networks), forming a web-like structure of coordinated assemblies (a
network of networks). The study of brain dynamics would therefore benefit from
an inspection of how functional sub-networks interact between them. In this
paper, we model the brain as an interconnected system composed of two specific
sub-networks, the left (L) and right (R) hemispheres, which compete with each
other for centrality, a topological measure of importance in a networked
system. Specifically, we consideredfunctional brain networks derived from
high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and investigated how node
centrality is shaped by interhemispheric connections. Our results show that the
distribution of centrality strongly depends on the number of functional
connections between hemispheres and the way these connections are distributed.
Additionally, we investigated the consequences of node failure on hemispherical
centrality, and showed how the abundance of inter-hemispheric links favors the
functional balance of centrality distribution between the hemispheres.

dominating set problem, which is one of the most important NP-hard problems on
graphs. This problem is defined as follows: Given an undirected graph $G = (V,
E)$, in which $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges. We say that a
set $D \subseteq V$ of vertices is a {\em dominating set} of $G$ if for each $v
\in V \setminus D$, there exists a vertex $u \in D$ such that $\{ u, v \} \in
E$. The vertices are revealed to an online algorithm one by one over time. When
a vertex is revealed, edges between the vertex and vertices revealed in the
past are also revealed. A revelaed subtree is connected at any time.
Immediately after the revelation of each vertex, an online algorithm can choose
vertices which were already revealed irrevocably and must maintain a dominating
set of a graph revealed so far. The cost of an algorithm on a given tree is the
number of vertices chosen by it, and its objective is to minimize the cost.
Eidenbenz (Technical report, Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, ETH
Z\""{u}rich, 2002) and Boyar et al.\ (SWAT 2016) studied the case in which given

competitive ratio is at most three, and proved that a lower bound on the
competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is two. In this paper, we also
focus on trees. We establish a matching lower bound for any deterministic

promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL. On-line planning
with look-ahead trees has proven successful in environments where transition
models are known a priori. However, in complex environments where transition
models need to be learned from data, the deficiencies of learned models have
limited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose
TreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a
drop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete
actions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a
transition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating
predicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values. We
also propose ATreeC, an actor-critic variant that augments TreeQN with a
softmax layer to form a stochastic policy network. Both approaches are trained
end-to-end, such that the learned model is optimised for its actual use in the

configurations of a system subject to hard constraints (microcanonical

constraints are softened (canonical ensemble). However, the mapping is exact
only when the size of the system is infinite and if the property of ensemble
equivalence (EE), i.e. the asymptotic identity of canonical and microcanonical
large deviations, holds. For finite systems, or when EE breaks down,
statistical physics is currently believed to provide no answer to the
combinatorial problem. In contrast with this expectation, here we establish
exact relationships connecting conjugate ensembles in full generality, even for
finite system size and when EE does not hold. We also show that in the
thermodynamic limit the ensembles are directly related through the matrix of
canonical (co)variances of the constraints, plus a correction term that
survives only if this matrix has an infinite number of finite eigenvalues.
These new relationships restore the possibility of enumerating microcanonical
configurations via canonical probabilities, thus reconnecting statistical
physics and combinatorics in realms where they were believed to be no longer in
mutual correspondence.

intervenes through the cosmological constant, has led to new cosmological
models. They show an accelerated cosmic expansion and satisfy several major
cosmological tests. No unknown particles are needed. Developing the weak field
approximation, we find that the here derived equation of motion corresponding
to Newton's equation also contains a small outwards acceleration term. The new
term is particularly significant for very low density systems.
  A modified virial theorem is derived and applied to clusters of galaxies. For
the Coma and Abell 2029 clusters, the dynamical masses are about a factor of 5
to 10 smaller than in the standard case. This tends to let no room for dark
matter in these clusters. Then, the two-body problem is studied and an equation
corresponding to the Binet equation is obtained. The results are applied to the
rotation curve of the outer layers of the Milky Way. Starting backwards from
the present rotation curve, we calculate the past evolution of the galactic
rotation and find that, in the early stages, it was steep and Keplerian. Thus,
the flat rotation curves of galaxies appears as an age effect, a result
consistent with recent observations of distant galaxies by Genzel et al. (2017)
and Lang et al. (2017). Finally, in an Appendix we also study the long-standing
problem of the increase with age of the vertical velocity dispersion in the
Galaxy. The observed increase appears to result from the new small acceleration
term in the equation of the harmonic oscillator describing stellar motions
around the galactic plane. Thus, we tend to conclude that neither the dark
energy, nor the dark matter seem to be needed in the proposed theoretical
context.

analysis, biomarker discovery and so on are all based on the matching of mass
spectra with peptide sequences, which is significantly influenced by the
quality of the spectra, such as the peak numbers, noisy peaks, signal-to-noise
ratios, etc. Hence, it is crucial to assess the quality of the spectra in order
for filtering and/or post-processing after identification. The handcrafted
features representing spectra quality, however, need human expertise to design
and are difficult to optimize, and thus the existing assessing algorithms are
still lacking in accuracy. Thus, there is a critical need for the robust and

eigenvectors, was recently proposed to provide detailed information about phase
synchronization in networks of nonlinear oscillators without any a priori need
for phase estimation. The discriminatory power of M-SSA is often enhanced by
using only the time series of the variable that provides the best observability
of the node dynamics. In practice, however, diverse factors could prevent one
to have access to this variable in some nodes and other variables should be
used, resulting in a mixed set of variables. In the present work, the impact of
this mixed measurement approach on the M-SSA is numerically investigated in
networks of R\""ossler systems and cord oscillators. The results are threefold.
First, a node measured by a poor variable, in terms of observability, becomes
virtually invisible to the technique. Second, a side effect of using a poor
variable is that the characterization of phase synchronization clustering of
the {\it other}\, nodes is hindered by a small amount. This suggests that,
given a network, synchronization analysis with M-SSA could be more reliable by
not measuring those nodes that are accessible only through poor variables.
Third, global phase synchronization could be detected even using only poor
variables, given enough of them are measured. These insights could be useful in
defining measurement strategies for both experimental design and real world
applications for use with M-SSA.

that uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) as a prior distribution on clean
speech. A standard approach to speech enhancement is to train a deep neural
network (DNN) to take noisy speech as input and output clean speech. Although
this supervised approach requires a very large amount of pair data for
training, it is not robust against unknown environments. Another approach is to
use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based on basis spectra trained on
clean speech in advance and those adapted to noise on the fly. This
semi-supervised approach, however, causes considerable signal distortion in
enhanced speech due to the unrealistic assumption that speech spectrograms are
linear combinations of the basis spectra. Replacing the poor linear generative
model of clean speech in NMF with a VAE---a powerful nonlinear deep generative
model---trained on clean speech, we formulate a unified probabilistic
generative model of noisy speech. Given noisy speech as observed data, we can
sample clean speech from its posterior distribution. The proposed method
outperformed the conventional DNN-based method in unseen noisy environments.

compact binary descriptors for images, has become critical for fast image
retrieval. Many existing deep hashing methods leverage quantization loss,
defined as distance between the features before and after quantization, to
reduce the error from binarizing features. While minimizing the quantization
loss guarantees that quantization has minimal effect on retrieval accuracy, it
unfortunately significantly reduces the expressiveness of features even before
the quantization. In this paper, we show that the above definition of
quantization loss is too restricted and in fact not necessary for maintaining
high retrieval accuracy. We therefore propose a new form of quantization loss
measured in triplets. The core idea of the triplet quantization loss is to
learn discriminative real-valued descriptors which lead to minimal loss on
retrieval accuracy after quantization. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmark data sets of different scales, CIFAR-10 and In-shop, demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.
Moreover, we show that the compact binary descriptors obtained with triplet
quantization loss lead to very small performance drop after quantization.

importance for both fundamental researches and future photonic and

large exciton binding energy, two-dimensional atomic semiconducting transition
metal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as an excellent platform for the
strong photon-exciton interaction by integrating with optically resonant
cavities. Here, we propose an all-semiconductor system composed of individual
silicon nanospheres and monolayer WS2 and investigate the resonance coupling
between these two constituents. By coating the silicon nanospheres with
monolayer WS2, we demonstrate the strong resonance coupling between the
magnetic dipole mode and A-exciton, evidenced by an anticrossing behavior in
the scattering energy diagram with a Rabi splitting of 77 meV. Compared with
the plasmonic analogues, the resonance coupling in all-semiconductor
heterostructure is much stronger and less sensitive to the spacing between the
silicon nanosphere core and WS2 shell. When the silicon nanospheres are placed
onto the WS2 monolayer with a point contact, resonance coupling manifested by
the quenching dips in the scattering spectra can also be observed at ambient
conditions, which involves only a few excitons. Finally, resonance coupling in
the all-semiconductor heterostructure can be active controlled by temperature
scanning. Our findings suggest that this all-semiconductor heterostructure can
be exploited for future on-chip nanophotonics associated with strong

automated construction of one-loop amplitudes and their reduction to scalar
integrals. The key idea is that the factorisation of one-loop integrands in a
product of loop segments makes it possible to perform various operations
on-the-fly while constructing the integrand. Reducing the integrand on-the-fly,
after each segment multiplication, the construction of loop diagrams and their
reduction are unified in a single numerical recursion. In this way we entirely
avoid objects with high tensor rank, thereby reducing the complexity of the
calculations in a drastic way. Thanks to the on-the-fly approach, which is
applied also to helicity summation and for the merging of different diagrams,
the speed of the original open-loop algorithm can be further augmented in a
very significant way. Moreover, addressing spurious singularities of the
employed reduction identities by means of simple expansions in rank-two Gram
determinants, we achieve a remarkably high level of numerical stability. These
features of the new algorithm, which will be made publicly available in a
forthcoming release of the OpenLoops program, are particularly attractive for
NLO multi-leg and NNLO real-virtual calculations.

Maxwell-Schr\""odinger-Plasma (MASP) model. This model was proposed to describe
the high order optical nonlinearities, and the low density free electron plasma
generated by a laser pulse propagating in a gas. The MASP model is based on
nonasymptotic, ab-initio equations, and accurately uses self-consistent
description of micro (quantum)- and macro (field)- variables. However, its
major drawback is a high computational cost, which in practice means that only
short propagation lengths can be calculated. In order to reduce this cost, we
study the MASP models enriched by a macroscopic evolution equation for
polarization, from its simplest version in a form of transport equation, to
more complex nonlinear variants. We show that homogeneous transport equation is
a more universal tool to simulate the high harmonic spectra at shorter times
and/or at a lower computational cost, while the nonlinear equation could be
useful for modeling the pulse profiles when the ionization level is moderate.
The gain associated with the considered modifications of the MASP model, being
expressed in reduction of computational time and the number of processors
involved, is of 2-3 orders of magnitude.

co-channel interference. Interference alignment (IA) was recently proposed as
an effective way to combat interference in wireless networks. The concept of
IA, though, is originated by the capacity study of interference channels and as
such, its performance is mainly gauged under ideal assumptions, such as
instantaneous and perfect channel state information (CSI) at all nodes, and
homogeneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) users, i.e., each user has the same
average SNR. Consequently, the performance of IA under realistic conditions has
not been completely investigated yet. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap
by providing a performance assessment of spatial IA in practical systems.
Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for the IA average sum-rate
when CSI is acquired through training and users have heterogeneous SNR. A main
insight from our analysis is that IA can indeed provide significant spectral
efficiency gains over traditional approaches in a wide range of dense network
scenarios. To demonstrate this, we consider the examples of linear, grid and
random network topologies.

reasonably robust, albeit slightly conservative, when these assumptions are
violated. Despite being conservative, we show that our method often offers more

the practical utility of the method is demonstrated on gene expression data

The model manages the dynamics of simulated group members with an adaptive
mechanism, balancing the probability of movement according to the dispersion of
the group; the cohesion mechanism is calibrated through the parameters
$\kappa_c$ and $\delta$. All scenarios are simulated with two procedures:
(Proc. 1) population composed of individual pedestrians, in order to validate
the simulation model and to provide baseline data; (Proc. 2) population
including dyads (50% of the simulated pedestrians), in order to verify their
impact. In the corridor scenario, the presence of dyads causes a reduction of
the velocities and specific flow at medium-high densities. Egress from a square
room with a unique central exit produces results in line with recent studies in
the literature, but also shows that the dyads negatively affect the dynamics,
leading generally to a slower walking speed and a lower pedestrian flow.
Ignoring the presence of dyads would lead to an overestimation of egress flows.

the rank-maximal matching problem we are given a bipartite graph $G = (A \cup

applicant $a \in A$ has a preference list over the set of his neighbours in
$G$, possibly involving ties. Preference lists are represented by ranks on the
edges - an edge $(a,p)$ has rank $i$, denoted as $rank(a,p)=i$, if post $p$
belongs to one of $a$'s $i$-th choices. A rank-maximal matching is one in which
the maximum number of applicants is matched to their rank one posts and subject
to this condition, the maximum number of applicants is matched to their rank
two posts, and so on. A rank-maximal matching can be computed in $O(\min(c
\sqrt{n},n) m)$ time, where $n$ denotes the number of applicants, $m$ the
number of edges and $c$ the maximum rank of an edge in an optimal solution.
  A central authority matches applicants to posts. It does so using one of the
rank-maximal matchings. Since there may be more than one rank- maximal matching
of $G$, we assume that the central authority chooses any one of them randomly.
Let $a_1$ be a manipulative applicant, who knows the preference lists of all
the other applicants and wants to falsify his preference list so that he has a
chance of getting better posts than if he were truthful. In the first problem
addressed in this paper the manipulative applicant $a_1$ wants to ensure that
he is never matched to any post worse than the most preferred among those of
rank greater than one and obtainable when he is truthful. In the second problem
the manipulator wants to construct such a preference list that the worst post
he can become matched to by the central authority is best possible or in other
words, $a_1$ wants to minimize the maximal rank of a post he can become matched
to.

distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the
classification. We can divide latent features into (i) ""core"" or ""conditionally
invariant"" features $X^\text{core}$ whose distribution $X^\text{core}\vert Y$,
conditional on the class $Y$, does not change substantially across domains and
(ii) ""style"" features $X^{\text{style}}$ whose distribution $X^{\text{style}}
\vert Y$ can change substantially across domains. Examples for style features
include position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex
ones like hair color, image quality or posture for images of persons. Our goal
is to minimize a loss that is robust under changes in the distribution of these
style features. In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself
is not observed and hence a latent variable.
  We do assume that we can sometimes observe a typically discrete identifier or
""$\mathrm{ID}$ variable"". In some applications we know, for example, that two
images show the same person, and $\mathrm{ID}$ then refers to the identity of
the person. The proposed method requires only a small fraction of images to
have $\mathrm{ID}$ information. We group observations if they share the same
class and identifier $(Y,\mathrm{ID})=(y,\mathrm{id})$ and penalize the
conditional variance of the prediction or the loss if we condition on
$(Y,\mathrm{ID})$. Using a causal framework, this conditional variance
regularization (CoRe) is shown to protect asymptotically against shifts in the
distribution of the style variables. Empirically, we show that the CoRe penalty
improves predictive accuracy substantially in settings where domain changes
occur in terms of image quality, brightness and color while we also look at
more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture.

ejections can develop and accelerate particles within several solar radii in
large solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Motivated by this, we present an
SEP acceleration study including the process that a fast shock propagates
through a streamer-like magnetic field with both closed and open field lines in
the low corona region. The acceleration of protons is modeled by numerically
solving the Parker transport equation with spatial diffusion both along and
across the magnetic field. We show that particles can be sufficiently
accelerated to up to several hundred MeV within 2-3 solar radii. When the shock
propagates through a streamer-like magnetic field, particles are more
efficiently accelerated compared to the case with a simple radial magnetic
field, mainly due to perpendicular shock geometry and the natural trapping
effect of closed magnetic fields. Our results suggest that the coronal magnetic
field configuration is an important factor for producing large SEP events. We
further show that the coronal magnetic field configuration strongly influences
the distribution of energetic particles, leading to different locations of
source regions along the shock front where most of high energy particles are
concentrated. This work may have strong implications to SEP observations. The
upcoming Parker Solar Probe will provide in situ observations for the
distribution of energetic particles in the coronal shock region, and test the
results of the study.

interacting with a fixed, flat surface. We find that details of the swimmer and

characteristics of the scattering event fall into two regimes, depending on the
relative magnitudes of the impact parameter, $\rho$, and the collision radius,
$R^\mathrm{coll}=R^\mathrm{P} + R^\mathrm{S}$. The range of particle motion,
defined as the maximum distance between two points on the trajectory, has only
a weak dependence on the impact parameter when $\rho < R^\mathrm{coll}$ and
decreases with the radius of the particle. In contrast, when
$\rho>R^\mathrm{coll}$ the range decreases as a power law in $\rho$ and is
insensitive to the size of the particle. We also demonstrate that large
particles can cause swimmers to be deflected through large angles. In some
instances, this swimmer deflection can lead to larger net displacements of the
particle. Based on these results, we estimate the effective diffusivity of a
particle in a dilute bath of swimmers and show that there is a non-monotonic

applications in future fifth generation (5G) networks. To meet the requirements
of lower latency and massive data transmission in AR/VR applications, a
solution with software-defined networking (SDN) architecture is proposed for 5G
small cell networks. On this basis, a multi-path cooperative route (MCR) scheme
is proposed to facilitate the AR/VR wireless transmissions in 5G small cell
networks, in which the delay of MCR scheme is analytically studied.
Furthermore, a service effective energy optimal (SEEO) algorithm is developed
for AR/VR wireless transmission in 5G small cell networks. Simulation results
indicate that both the delay and service effective energy (SEE) of the proposed
MCR scheme outperform the delay and SEE of the conventional single path route
scheme in 5G small cell networks.

charges due to collisions and generate long-range interactions. We perform
molecular dynamic simulations in three dimensions for a dilute, freely-cooling

As compared to the case of clustering of viscoelastic particles solely due to
dissipation, we find that the electrostatic interactions due to collisional
charging alter the characteristic size, morphology and growth rate of the
clusters. The average cluster size grows with time as a power law, whose
exponent is relatively larger in the charged gas than the neutral case. The
growth of the average cluster size is found to be independent of the ratio of
characteristic Coulomb to thermal energy, or equivalently, of the typical
Bjerrum length. However, this ratio alters the crossover time of the growth.
Both simulations and mean-field calculations based on the Smoluchowski's
equation suggest that a suppression of particle diffusion due to the
electrostatic interactions helps in the aggregation process.

a breakdown of this network. This can happen when the existing financial links

called bases. RNA sequences fold into secondary structures where some bases
match one another while others remain unpaired. Pseudoknot-free secondary
structures can be represented as well-parenthesized expressions with additional
dots, where pairs of matching parentheses symbolize paired bases and dots,
unpaired bases. The two fundamental problems in RNA algorithmic are to predict
how sequences fold within some model of energy and to design sequences of bases
which will fold into targeted secondary structures. Predicting how a given RNA
sequence folds into a pseudoknot-free secondary structure is known to be
solvable in cubic time since the eighties and in truly subcubic time by a
recent result of Bringmann et al. (FOCS 2016). As a stark contrast, it is
unknown whether or not designing a given RNA secondary structure is a tractable
task; this has been raised as a challenging open question by Anne Condon (ICALP
2003). Because of its crucial importance in a number of fields such as
pharmaceutical research and biochemistry, there are dozens of heuristics and
software libraries dedicated to RNA secondary structure design. It is therefore
rather surprising that the computational complexity of this central problem in
bioinformatics has been unsettled for decades.
  In this paper we show that, in the simplest model of energy which is the
Watson-Crick model the design of secondary structures is NP-complete if one
adds natural constraints of the form: index $i$ of the sequence has to be
labeled by base $b$. This negative result suggests that the same lower bound
holds for more realistic models of energy. It is noteworthy that the additional
constraints are by no means artificial: they are provided by all the RNA design
pieces of software and they do correspond to the actual practice.

method forms the basis of most currently operational weather forecasting
systems. In practice the optimization becomes infeasible if the time window is
too long due to the non-convexity of the cost function, the effect of model
errors, and the limited precision of the ODE solvers. Hence the window has to
be kept sufficiently short, and the observations in the previous windows can be
taken into account via a Gaussian background (prior) distribution. The choice
of the background covariance matrix is an important question that has received
much attention in the literature. In this paper, we define the background
covariances in a principled manner, based on observations in the previous $b$
assimilation windows, for a parameter $b\ge 1$. The method is at most $b$ times
more computationally expensive than using fixed background covariances,
requires little tuning, and greatly improves the accuracy of 4D-Var. As a

variants to explore a suite of observables: the M-sigma relation, mass
functions of both the overall and broad-line quasar population, and luminosity
functions as a function of redshift. We find that ""downsizing"" is a natural
consequence of our improved velocity dispersion mappings, and that high-mass
SMBHs assemble earlier than low-mass SMBHs. The burst mode of fuelling is
sufficient to explain the assembly of SMBHs to z=2, but an additional steady
mode is required to both assemble low-mass SMBHs and reproduce the low-redshift
luminosity function. We discuss in detail the trade-offs in matching various
observables and the interconnected modelling components that govern them. As a
result, we demonstrate the utility as well as the limitations of these
semi-analytic techniques.

supersymmetric (SUSY) model involves extra exotic matter beyond the MSSM. In
the simplest phenomenologically viable scenarios the lightest exotic fermions
are neutral and stable. These states should be substantially lighter than 1 eV
forming hot dark matter in the Universe. The low-energy effective Lagrangian of
the SUSY model under consideration possesses an approximate global U(1)_E
symmetry associated with the exotic states. The U(1)_E symmetry is explicitly
broken because of the interactions between the right-handed neutrino
superfields and exotic matter supermultiplets. As a consequence the decays of
the lightest right-handed neutrino/sneutrino give rise to both U(1)_E and
U(1)_{B-L} asymmetries. When all right-handed neutrino/sneutrino are relatively
light \sim 10^6-10^7 GeV the appropriate amount of the baryon asymmetry can be
induced via these decays if the Yukawa couplings of the lightest right-handed
neutrino superfields to the exotic matter supermultiplets vary between

polydispersity on the dynamics of suspensions of soft PNIPAM colloidal

scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The zero shear
viscosity ($\eta_{0}$) data of these colloidal suspensions, estimated from
rheometric experiments as a function of the effective volume fraction
$\phi_{eff}$ of the suspensions, increases with increase in $\phi_{eff}$ and
shows a dramatic increase at $\phi_{eff}=\phi_{0}$. The data for $\eta_{0}$ as
a function of $\phi_{eff}$ fits well to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT)
equation. It is observed that increasing PDIs results in increasingly fragile
supercooled liquid-like behavior, with the parameter $\phi_{0}$, extracted from
the fits to the VFT equation, shifting towards higher $\phi_{eff}$. The
observed increase in fragility is attributed to the prevalence of dynamical
heterogeneities (DHs) in these polydisperse suspensions, while the simultaneous
shift in $\phi_{0}$ is ascribed to the decoupling of the dynamics of the
smallest and largest particles. Finally, it is observed that the intrinsic
nonlinearity of these suspensions, estimated at the third harmonic near
$\phi_{0}$ in Fourier transform oscillatory rheological experiments, increases
with increase in PDIs. Our results are in agreement with theoretical

DenseNet's extreme connectivity pattern may hinder its scalability to high

connections are prohibitively expensive. This work first experimentally shows
that one key advantage of skip connections is to have short distances among
feature layers during backpropagation. Specifically, using a fixed number of
skip connections, the connection patterns with shorter backpropagation distance
among layers have more accurate predictions. Following this insight, we propose
a connection template, Log-DenseNet, which, in comparison to DenseNet, only
slightly increases the backpropagation distances among layers from 1 to ($1 +

Hence, Log-DenseNets are easier than DenseNets to implement and to scale. We

also confirm that models with the highest accuracies are, unsurprisingly, the

principals who have different utility functions should adopt a {\em
Pareto-optimal} policy, i.e., a policy that cannot be improved upon for one
agent without making sacrifices for another. A famous theorem of Harsanyi shows
that, when the principals have a common prior on the outcome distributions of
all policies, a Pareto-optimal policy for the agent is one that maximizes a
fixed, weighted linear combination of the principals' utilities.
  In this paper, we show that Harsanyi's theorem does not hold for principals
with different priors, and derive a more precise generalization which does
hold, which constitutes our main result. In this more general case, the
relative weight given to each principal's utility should evolve over time
according to how well the agent's observations conform with that principal's
prior. The result has implications for the design of contracts, treaties, joint
ventures, and robots.

Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).
This powerful technique allows us to identify and measure sub-arcsecond compact
components in low-frequency radio sources across large areas of sky without the
need for long-baseline interferometry or ionospheric calibration. We present
the results of a five-minute observation of a 30x30 sq. deg MWA field at 162
MHz with 0.5 second time resolution. Of the 2550 continuum sources detected in
this field, 302 (12 per cent) show rapid fluctuations caused by IPS. We find
that at least 32% of bright low-frequency radio sources contain a sub-arcsec
compact component that contributes over 40% of the total flux density. Perhaps
surprisingly, peaked-spectrum radio sources are the dominant population among
the strongly-scintillating, low-frequency sources in our sample. While
gamma-ray AGN are generally compact, flat-spectrum radio sources at higher
frequencies, the 162 MHz properties of many of the Fermi blazars in our field
are consistent with a compact component embedded within more extended
low-frequency emission. The detection of a known pulsar in our field shows that
the wide-field IPS technique is at the threshold of sensitivity needed to
detect new pulsars using image plane analysis, and scaling the current MWA
sensitivity to that expected for SKA-low implies that large IPS-based pulsar
searches will be feasible with SKA. Calibration strategies for the SKA require
a better knowledge of the space density of compact sources at low radio
frequencies, which IPS observations can now provide.

Dyads walk slower than single pedestrians in all phases. The crossing behaviour
of dyads is characterized by the emergence of a leader who takes the decision

Born-Infeld (BI) black holes in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, where the charge
of the system can vary and the cosmological constant (pressure) is fixed. We
find that the BI parameter crucially affects the temperature of the black hole
when the horizon radius, $r_{+}$, is small. We observe that depending on the
value of the nonlinear parameter, $\beta $, BI-AdS black hole may be identified
as RN black hole for $Q\geq Q_{m}$, and Schwarzschild-like black hole for
$Q<Q_{m}$, where $Q_{m}=1/\left(8\pi \beta \right) $ is the \textit{marginal}
charge. We analytically calculate the critical point ($% Q_c,T_c, r_{+c}$) by
solving the cubic equation and study the critical behaviour of the system. We
also explore the behavior of Gibbs free energy for BI-AdS black hole. We find
out that the phase behaviour of BI-AdS black hole depends on the charge $Q$.
For $Q>Q_{c}$, the Gibbs free energy is single valued and the system is locally
stable ($C_{Q}>0$), while for $% Q<Q_{c}$, it becomes multivalued and
$C_{Q}<0$. In the range of $% Q_{z}<Q<Q_{c}$, a first order phase transition
occurs between small black hole (SBH) and large black hole (LBH). Interestingly
enough, in the range of $Q_{t}\leq Q\leq Q_{z}$, a reentrant phase transition
occurs between intermediate (large) black hole, SBH and LBH in
Schwarzschild-type region. This means that in addition to the first order phase
transition which separates SBH and LBH, a finite jump in Gibbs free energy
leads to a \textit{% zeroth order} phase transition between SBH and
intermediate black hole (LBH) where initiates from $Q=Q_{z}$ and terminates at
$Q=Q_{t}$.

  problem""","Bachelor's thesis, Beijing Univ (2014)",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After every U.S. national census, a state legislature is required to redraw
the boundaries of congressional districts in order to account for changes in
population. At the moment this is done in a highly partisan way, with
districting done in order to maximize the benefits to the party in power. This
is a threat to U.S's democracy. There have been proposals to take the
re-districting out of the hands of political parties and give to an
""independent"" commission. Independence is hard to come by and in this thesis we
want to explore the possibility of computer generated districts that as far as
possible to avoid partisan ""gerrymandering"". The idea we have is to treat every
possible redistricting as a state in a Markov Chain: every state is obtained by
its former state in random way. With some technical conditions, we will get a
near uniform member of the states after running sufficiently long time (the
mixing time). Then we can say the uniform member is an impartial distribution.
Based on the geographical and statistical data of Pennsylvania, I have achieved
the Markov Chain algorithm with several constraints, done optimization
experiments and a web interface is going to be made to show the results.

production in arid and semi-arid regions. It causes reduction of cultivable
area and combined with other factors, presents a serious threat to food
stability in these areas. Context: In front of this problem, the selection of
salt tolerant species and varieties remains the best economic approach for
exploitation and rehabilitation of salt-affected regions. Objective: The
purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed germination response
of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations in order to explore
opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant genotypes. Methods: The
salinity effect was examined by measuring some agro-morphological parameters in
controlled growth environment using five treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and
400 mM of NaCl. Results: The analyzed data revealed significant variability in
salt response within and between species. All growth parameters were
progressively reduced by increased NaCl concentrations. Growth in height, leaf
number and total plant dry weight were considered as the most sensitive
parameters. However, the growth reduction varied among species in accordance
with their tolerance level. It is important to note that all species survived
at the highest salinity (400 mM). Whereas A. horrida and A. raddiana were
proved to be often the best tolerant, they recorded the lowest reduction
percentage at this stage. Conclusion: The genetic variability found in the
studied species at seedling stage may be used to select genotypes particularly
suitable for rehabilitation and exploitation of lands affected by salinity.

human-centered research activities. In recent years, motion recognition based

artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have gained remarkable

have achieved great success for image-based tasks, and recurrent neural
networks (RNN) are renowned for sequence-based problems. Specifically, deep
learning methods based on the CNN and RNN architectures have been adopted for
motion recognition using RGB-D data. In this paper, a detailed overview of
recent advances in RGB-D-based motion recognition is presented. The reviewed
methods are broadly categorized into four groups, depending on the modality
adopted for recognition: RGB-based, depth-based, skeleton-based and
RGB+D-based. As a survey focused on the application of deep learning to
RGB-D-based motion recognition, we explicitly discuss the advantages and
limitations of existing techniques. Particularly, we highlighted the methods of
encoding spatial-temporal-structural information inherent in video sequence,
and discuss potential directions for future research.

  Spectral Graph Theory","12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Merit based promotion & tenure decision have always been controversial. This
paper suggests an agent based model of the decision making processs using
spectral graph theory, where the voting agents are the vertices of the graph,
and edge weights are determined based on the extent of collaborative research
between the agents, as well as their estimated levels of social interactions.
The model assumes that agents with lower research productivities tend to
interact more often with one another. Using the graph theoretic spectrum, the
paper proposes a 2-dimensional influence diagram that maps the voting agents
into points on a 2-dimensional grid, where agents that are likely to influence
each other more are closely spaced. Next, a dynamic model is addressed, where
votes are determined based on very small randomly assigned initial values, and
the mutual interaction during the decision making process. The model is able to
accurately reproduce a known promotion decision making from a department of a
research oriented university which involved a sizeable number of voting agents
with low research outputs.

effect of Majorana-Kramers pair on Kondo fixed point and conversely the effect
of Kondo interaction on Majorana-Kramers pair. This way we can capture the
signatures of Majorana fermions on Kondo effect in quantum dots which can be
probed feasibly in experiments. Employing the renormalization group method, we
report the first study of the signatures of Majorana-Kramers pair in the
dynamical spin susceptibility of the quantum dot electrons. We not only
calculate the flow equations for coupling constants but also study the
renormalization of observables and especially calculate dynamical spin
susceptibility. We propose that since these dynamical quantities have
signatures of Majorana-Kramers pair, so they provide an unambiguous
experimental probe for detection of Majorana fermions in TRITOPS.

electric field can result in significant modulation of the ground state.
However, in many oxide multilayers with strong application potentials, e.g.
ferroelectric tunnel junctions and solid-oxide fuel cells, understanding V_O
behaviour in various layers under an applied electric field remains a
challenge, owing to complex V_O transport between different layers. By sweeping
the external voltage, a reversible manipulation of V_O and a corresponding
fixed magnetic phase transition sequence in cobaltite/manganite
(SrCoO3-x/La0.45Sr0.55MnO3-y) heterostructures are reported. The magnetic phase
transition sequence confirms that the priority of electric-field-induced V_O
formation/annihilation in the complex bilayer system is mainly determined by
the V_O formation energies and Gibbs free energy differences, which is
supported by theoretical analysis. We not only realize a reversible
manipulation of the magnetic phase transition in an oxide bilayer, but also
provide insight into the electric field control of V_O engineering in
heterostructures.

of 0.1-0.5 Ohm/Oe. These characteristics can be controlled by varying the
sensor dimension and current density in the Pt layer. The latter is in the
range of 1 x 10^5 - 10^7 A/cm^2. Experimental results of fabricated sensors
with selected sizes agree well with the simulation results. For a Wheatstone
