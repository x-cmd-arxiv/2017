  cross-like cavities",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quest for large and low frequency band gaps is one of the principal
objectives pursued in a number of engineering applications, ranging from noise
absorption to vibration control, to seismic wave abatement. For this purpose, a
plethora of complex architectures (including multi-phase materials) and
multi-physics approaches have been proposed in the past, often involving
difficulties in their practical realization.
  To address this issue, in this work we propose an easy-to-manufacture design
able to open large, low frequency complete Lamb band gaps exploiting a suitable
arrangement of masses and stiffnesses produced by cavities in a monolithic
material. The performance of the designed structure is evaluated by numerical
simulations and confirmed by Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV)
measurements on an isotropic polyvinyl chloride plate in which a square ring
region of cross-like cavities is fabricated. The full wave field reconstruction
clearly confirms the ability of even a limited number of unit cell rows of the
proposed design to efficiently attenuate Lamb waves. In addition, numerical
simulations show that the structure allows to shift of the central frequency of
the BG through geometrical modifications. The design may be of interest for
applications in which large BGs at low frequencies are required.

part because of their ability to give good accuracy with small models. We
describe two extensions to the standard tree boosting algorithm designed to
increase this advantage. The first improvement extends the boosting formalism
from scalar-valued trees to vector-valued trees. This allows individual trees
to be used as multiclass classifiers, rather than requiring one tree per class,
and drastically reduces the model size required for multiclass problems. We
also show that some other popular vector-valued gradient boosted trees
modifications fit into this formulation and can be easily obtained in our
implementation. The second extension, layer-by-layer boosting, takes smaller
steps in function space, which is empirically shown to lead to a faster
convergence and to a more compact ensemble. We have added both improvements to
the open-source TensorFlow Boosted trees (TFBT) package, and we demonstrate
their efficacy on a variety of multiclass datasets. We expect these extensions
will be of particular interest to boosted tree applications that require small
models, such as embedded devices, applications requiring fast inference, or
applications desiring more interpretable models.

both AI researchers and musicians. However, learning to generate euphonious
melody has turned out to be highly challenging due to a number of factors.
Representation of multivariate property of notes has been one of the primary
challenges. It is also difficult to remain in the permissible spectrum of
musical variety, outside of which would be perceived as a plain random play
without auditory pleasantness. Observing the conventional structure of pop
music poses further challenges. In this paper, we propose to represent each
note and its properties as a unique `word,' thus lessening the prospect of
misalignments between the properties, as well as reducing the complexity of
learning. We also enforce regularization policies on the range of notes, thus
encouraging the generated melody to stay close to what humans would find easy
to follow. Furthermore, we generate melody conditioned on song part
information, thus replicating the overall structure of a full song.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate auditorily
pleasant songs that are more indistinguishable from human-written ones than
previous models.

umbrae with three-minute oscillations. Our technique allows us to estimate both
the vertical distance between atmospheric layers and the wave-propagation speed
without specifying any extra parameters, in particular, the phase speed of the
wave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected wave
paths of slow MHD waves propagating through the atmospheric layers of different
heights and guided by the magnetic field. The length of the projected wave path
depends upon the distance between the layers and the inclination angle of the
magnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing us to estimate the
distance between the layers from measured projected wave paths and the local
magnetic-field vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at
different heights allows for the calculation of the phase speed. We estimated
the vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature minimum
(1600 {\AA}) and transition region (304 {\AA}), as well as the average phase
speed above the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions. We found that the
distance between the 1600 {\AA} emission layer and the transition region above
the sunspot umbrae lies in the range of 500 -- 800 km. The average phase speed
between these layers was found to be about 30 km/s giving the sound speed of 6
km/s. The temperature between the layers has been roughly estimated as 3000 K
and corresponds to the region of the temperature minimum. The results obtained
are consistent with the semiempirical model of the sunspot umbrae atmosphere by

parametrically driven system (which we also consider to be a single oscillator
in the simplest case) which is coupled to a reservoir where the energy is
dumped. We show that the cooling of the oscillator (that can be achieved due to
the resonant transport of its phonon excitations into the environment) is
always stopped by a fundamental heating process that is always dominant at
sufficiently low temperatures. This process can be described as the non
resonant production of excitation pairs. This result is in close analogy with
the recent study that showed that pair production is responsible for enforcing
the validity of the dynamical version of the third law of thermodynamics (Phys.
Rev. E 95, 012146). Interestingly, we relate our model to the usual ones used
to describe laser cooling of a single trapped ion and reobtaining the correct
limiting temperatures for the limits of resolved and non-resolved sidebands.
Our findings (that also serve to estimate the lowest temperatures that can be
achieved in a variety of other situations) indicate that the limit for laser
cooling can also be associated with non resonant pair production. In fact, as
we show, this is the case: The limiting temperature for laser cooling is
achieved when the cooling transitions induced by the resonant transport of
excitations from the motion into the electromagnetic environment is compensated
by the heating transitions induced by the creation of phonon-photon pairs.

hard-threshold activations is becoming increasingly important, both for network
quantization, which can drastically reduce time and energy requirements, and
for creating large integrated systems of deep networks, which may have
non-differentiable components and must avoid vanishing and exploding gradients
for effective learning. However, since gradient descent is not applicable to
hard-threshold functions, it is not clear how to learn networks of them in a
principled way. We address this problem by observing that setting targets for
hard-threshold hidden units in order to minimize loss is a discrete
optimization problem, and can be solved as such. The discrete optimization goal
is to find a set of targets such that each unit, including the output, has a
linearly separable problem to solve. Given these targets, the network
decomposes into individual perceptrons, which can then be learned with standard
convex approaches. Based on this, we develop a recursive mini-batch algorithm
for learning deep hard-threshold networks that includes the popular but poorly
justified straight-through estimator as a special case. Empirically, we show
that our algorithm improves classification accuracy in a number of settings,
including for AlexNet and ResNet-18 on ImageNet, when compared to the
straight-through estimator.

transcription of a segment of DNA, concomitant with the progress of two DNA
replication forks on the same DNA segment. One of the species of particles
($P$) represents RNAP motors while the other ($R$) represents replication
forks. Motivated by the biological phenomena that this model is intended to
capture, a maximum of only two $R$ particles are allowed to enter the lattice
from two opposite ends whereas the unrestricted number of $P$ particles
constitute a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a segment
in the middle of the lattice. Consequently, the lattice consists of three
segments; the encounters of the $P$ particles with the $R$ particles are
confined within the middle segment (segment $2$) whereas only the $R$ particles
can occupy the sites in the segments $1$ and $3$. The model captures three
distinct pathways for resolving the co-directional as well as head-collision
between the $P$ and $R$ particles. Using Monte Carlo simulations and heuristic
analytical arguments that combine exact results for the TASEP with mean-field
approximations, we predict the possible outcomes of the conflict between the
traffic of RNAP motors ($P$ particles engaged in transcription) and the
replication forks ($R$ particles). The outcomes, of course, depend on the
dynamical phase of the TASEP of $P$ particles. In principle, the model can be
adapted to the experimental conditions to account for the data quantitatively.

problems be solved in real time, across a complex web of interacting protocols

the network has grown so complex that it is seemingly unmanageable. In this new
era, network management requires a fundamentally new approach. Instead of
optimizations based on closed-form analysis of individual protocols, network
operators need data-driven, machine-learning-based models of end-to-end and
application performance based on high-level policy goals and a holistic view of
the underlying components. Instead of anomaly detection algorithms that operate
on offline analysis of network traces, operators need classification and
detection algorithms that can make real-time, closed-loop decisions. Networks
should learn to drive themselves. This paper explores this concept, discussing
how we might attain this ambitious goal by more closely coupling measurement
with real-time control and by relying on learning for inference and prediction

spherical Gaussians, when the components of the mixture are well separated. In
the most basic form of this problem, we are given samples from a uniform
mixture of $k$ standard spherical Gaussians, and the goal is to estimate the
means up to accuracy $\delta$ using $poly(k,d, 1/\delta)$ samples.
  In this work, we study the following question: what is the minimum separation
needed between the means for solving this task? The best known algorithm due to
Vempala and Wang [JCSS 2004] requires a separation of roughly
$\min\{k,d\}^{1/4}$. On the other hand, Moitra and Valiant [FOCS 2010] showed
that with separation $o(1)$, exponentially many samples are required. We
address the significant gap between these two bounds, by showing the following
results.
  1. We show that with separation $o(\sqrt{\log k})$, super-polynomially many
samples are required. In fact, this holds even when the $k$ means of the
Gaussians are picked at random in $d=O(\log k)$ dimensions.
  2. We show that with separation $\Omega(\sqrt{\log k})$, $poly(k,d,1/\delta)$
samples suffice. Note that the bound on the separation is independent of
$\delta$. This result is based on a new and efficient ""accuracy boosting""
algorithm that takes as input coarse estimates of the true means and in time
$poly(k,d, 1/\delta)$ outputs estimates of the means up to arbitrary accuracy
$\delta$ assuming the separation between the means is $\Omega(\min\{\sqrt{\log
k},\sqrt{d}\})$ (independently of $\delta$).
  We also present a computationally efficient algorithm in $d=O(1)$ dimensions
with only $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ separation. These results together essentially
characterize the optimal order of separation between components that is needed
to learn a mixture of $k$ spherical Gaussians with polynomial samples.

from discretization of ordinary and partial differential equations with Caputo
fractional derivative w.r.t time variable. First, we consider a finite
difference scheme to solve a two-sided fractional ordinary equation.
Furthermore, we present a fast solution technique to accelerate Toeplitz
matrix-vector multiplications arising from finite difference discretization.
This fast solution technique is based on a fast Fourier transform and depends
on the special structure of coefficient matrices, and it helps to reduce the
computational work from $O(N^{3})$ required by traditional methods to
$O(Nlog^{2}N)$ and the memory requirement from $O(N^{2})$ to $O(N)$ without
using any lossy compression, where $N$ is the number of unknowns. Two finite
difference schemes to solve time fractional hyperbolic equations with different
fractional order $\gamma$ are considered. We present a fast solution technique
depending on the special structure of coefficient matrices by rearranging the
order of unknowns. It helps to reduce the computational work from $O(N^2M)$
required by traditional methods to $O(N$log$^{2}N)$ and the memory requirement
from $O(NM)$ to $O(N)$ without using any lossy compression, where $N=\tau^{-1}$
and $\tau$ is the size of time step, $M=h^{-1}$ and $h$ is the size of space
step. Importantly, a fast method is employed to solve the classical time
fractional diffusion equation with a lower coast at $O(MN$log$^2N)$, where the
direct method requires an overall computational complexity of $O(N^2M)$.
Moreover, the applicability and accuracy of the scheme are demonstrated by
numerical experiments to support our theoretical analysis.

  sub-Gaussian martingale difference noise",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear Least Squares is a very well known technique for parameter estimation,
which is used even when sub-optimal, because of its very low computational
requirements and the fact that exact knowledge of the noise statistics is not
required. Surprisingly, bounding the probability of large errors with finitely
many samples has been left open, especially when dealing with correlated noise
with unknown covariance. In this paper we analyze the finite sample performance
of the linear least squares estimator under sub-Gaussian martingale difference
noise. In order to analyze this important question we used concentration of
measure bounds. When applying these bounds we obtained tight bounds on the tail
of the estimator's distribution. We show the fast exponential convergence of
the number of samples required to ensure a given accuracy with high
probability. We provide probability tail bounds on the estimation error's norm.
Our analysis method is simple and uses simple $L_{\infty}$ type bounds on the
estimation error. The tightness of the bounds is tested through simulation. The
proposed bounds make it possible to predict the number of samples required for
least squares estimation even when least squares is sub-optimal and used for
computational simplicity. The finite sample analysis of least squares models
with this general noise model is novel.

characterization from imprecisely labeled hyperspectral data is presented. In
many hyperspectral target detection problems, acquiring accurately labeled
training data is difficult. Furthermore, each pixel containing target is likely
to be a mixture of both target and non-target signatures (i.e., sub-pixel
targets), making extracting a pure prototype signature for the target class
from the data extremely difficult. The proposed approach addresses these
problems by introducing a data mixing model and optimizing the response of the
hybrid sub-pixel detector within a multiple instance learning framework. The
proposed approach iterates between estimating a set of discriminative target
and non-target signatures and solving a sparse unmixing problem. After learning
target signatures, a signature based detector can then be applied on test data.
Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection experiments show the
proposed algorithm is effective at learning discriminative target signatures

presently planned for Scorpius to accelerate four 2-kA electron pulses to 20
MeV from an injected energy of 2 MeV. The goal of Scorpius is to deliver a
multi-pulse electron beam with quality sufficient for use in flash radiography
of large-scale explosively-driven experiments. Beam physics has a profound
effect on the quality of multi-pulse radiographs. Beam halo or asymmetry causes
emittance growth, which enlarges spot size, thereby degrading resolution. Beam
centroid motion due to instabilities is especially problematic. High-frequency
motion blurs the radiographic spot size, thereby degrading resolution.
Low-frequency motion causes pulse-to-pulse wandering of the source spot,
thereby degrading registration of successive radiographs. We use a wide range
of tools to investigate potential beam physics problems associated with
Scorpius. In addition to analytic theory and experimental data from our
operational LIAs, we use a number of reliable beam dynamics computer codes.
These include both beam envelope and particle in cell (PIC) codes.

Classic
conceptions of WM capacity assume the system possesses a finite number of

models typically assume there is no hard upper bound on the number of items
that can be stored, but WM fidelity decreases with the number of items. We
analyze a neural field model of multi-item WM that associates each item with
the location of a bump in a finite spatial domain, considering items that span
a one-dimensional continuous feature space. Our analysis relates the neural
architecture of the network to accumulated errors and capacity limitations
arising during the delay period of a multi-item WM task. Networks with stronger
synapses support wider bumps that interact more, whereas networks with weaker
synapses support narrower bumps that are more susceptible to noise
perturbations. There is an optimal synaptic strength that both limits bump
interaction events and the effects of noise perturbations. This optimum shifts
to weaker synapses as the number of items stored in the network is increased.
Our model not only provides a neural circuit explanation for WM capacity, but
also speaks to how capacity relates to the arrangement of stored items in a
feature space.

field, but the right-handed part of which is just saturated completely by
inserting a suitable product of the SO(10)-invariant 't Hooft vertices in terms
of the right-handed field. The definition of the measure applies to all
possible topological sectors. The measure possesses all required transformation
properties under lattice symmetries and the induced effective action is CP
invariant. The global U(1) symmetry of the left-handed field is anomalous due
to the non-trivial transformation of the measure, while that of the
right-handed field is explicitly broken by the 't Hooft vertices. There remains
the issue of locality in the gauge-field dependence of the Weyl fermion
measure, but the question can be addressed in the weak gauge-coupling expansion
at least using Monte Carlo methods without encountering the sign problem. We
also discuss the relations of our formulation to other approaches/proposals to

formation contributes non-negligibly to the UVLF at luminosities that are

are not direct observables, these affect measurements of clustering statistics
of small-scale (sub-survey) perturbations in the large-scale structure,

we show that the large-scale tides induced by scalar perturbations cause
apparent anisotropic distortions in the redshift-space power spectrum of
galaxies in a way depending on an alignment between the tides, the wavevector
of small-scale modes and the line-of-sight direction. Using the perturbation
theory of structure formation, we derive the $\textit{response}$ function of
the redshift-space power spectrum to the large-scale tides. We then investigate
the impact of the large-scale tides on estimation of cosmological distances and
the redshift-space distortion parameter via the measured redshift-space power
spectrum for a hypothetical large-volume survey, based on the Fisher matrix
formalism. To do this, we treat the large-scale tides as a signal, rather than
an additional source of the statistical errors, and show that a degradation in
the parameter is restored if we can employ the prior on the rms amplitude
expected for the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. We also discuss whether
the large-scale tides can be constrained at an accuracy better than the CDM
prediction, if the effects up to a larger wavenumber in the nonlinear regime

log(xi_ion/[Hz erg$^{-1}$])=25.06 (25.34), assuming the Calzetti (SMC) curve
for the UV dust correction and a scatter of 0.28 dex in xi_ion distribution.
After accounting for observational uncertainties and variations in dust
attenuation, we conclude that the remaining scatter in xi_ion is likely
dominated by galaxy-to-galaxy variations in stellar populations, including the
slope and upper-mass cutoff of the initial mass function, stellar metallicity,
star-formation burstiness, and stellar evolution (e.g., single/binary star
evolution). Moreover, xi_ion is elevated in galaxies with high ionization
states (high [OIII]/[OII]) and low oxygen abundances (low [NII]/H$\alpha$ and
high [OIII]/H$\beta$) in the ionized ISM. However, xi_ion does not correlate
with the offset from the z~0 star-forming locus in the BPT diagram, suggesting
no change in the hardness of ionizing radiation accompanying the offset from
the z~0 sequence. We also find that galaxies with blue UV spectral slopes
($\langle\beta\rangle$=-2.1) have elevated xi_ion by a factor of ~2 relative to
the average xi_ion of the sample ($\langle\beta\rangle$=-1.4). If these blue
galaxies are similar to those at z > 6, our results suggest that a lower Lyman
continuum escape fraction is required for galaxies to maintain reionization,
compared to the canonical xi_ion predictions from stellar population models.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that even with robustly dust-corrected H$\alpha$,
the UV dust attenuation can cause on average a ~0.3dex systematic uncertainty
in xi_ion calculations.

susceptible to long-wavelength density and tidal fluctuations. These long modes
modulate the growth and expansion rate of local structures, shifting them in
both amplitude and scale. These effects are often named the growth and dilation
effects, respectively. In particular the dilation shifts the baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) peak and breaks the assumption of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP)
test. This cannot be removed with reconstruction techniques because the effect
originates from long modes outside the survey. In redshift space, the long
modes generate a large-scale radial peculiar velocity that affects the
redshift-space distortion (RSD) signal. We compute the redshift-space response
functions of the galaxy power spectrum to long density and tidal modes at
leading order in perturbation theory, including both the growth and dilation
terms. We validate these response functions against measurements from simulated
galaxy mock catalogs. As one application, long density and tidal modes beyond
the scale of a survey correlate various observables leading to an excess error
known as the super-sample covariance, and thus weaken their constraining power.

planetary system in its disk. We analyze new VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric
images of HD 100546 with filters in H$\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum. We
have probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a
region < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of
~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk
are more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a
preferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous
polarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\pm$ 2 to 45 $\pm$ 9 au,
with a position angle and inclination of 137 $\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\pm$ 8$^o$.
The comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could
increase with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements
are still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of
the innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming
recent results based on intensity imagery. We set an upper limit to its mass
accretion rate < 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr for a sub-stellar mass of
15M$_{Jup}$. Finally, we report the first detection (> 3$\sigma$) of a ~ 20 au
bar-like structure that crosses the gap through the central region of HD
100546. It is tentatively suggested that the bar could be dust dragged by
infalling gas that radially flows from the outer disk. This could represent an
exceptional case in which a small-scale radial inflow is observed in a single
system. If this scenario is confirmed, it could explain the presence of atomic
gas in the inner disk that would otherwise accrete on to the central star on a
timescale of a few months/years, as previously indicated from
spectro-interferometric data, and could be related with additional (undetected)
planets.

cm$^{-3}$) on sub-pc scale, which absorbs about 30 per cent of the ionising
continuum. The outer size of the BLR is likely set by dust sublimation, and its
density by the incident radiation pressure compression (RPC). But, what is the
origin of this gas, and what sets its covering factor (CF)? Czerny & Hryniewicz
(2011) suggested that the BLR is a failed dusty wind from the outer accretion
disc. We explore the expected dust properties, and the implied BLR structure.
We find that graphite grains sublimate only at $T\simeq 2000$ K at the
predicted density of $\sim 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, and therefore large graphite
grains ($\ge 0.3$ $\mu$m) survive down to the observed size of the BLR, $R_{\rm
BLR}$. The dust opacity in the accretion disc atmosphere is $\sim 50$ times
larger than previously assumed, and leads to an inflated torus-like structure,
with a predicted peak height at $R_{\rm BLR}$. The illuminated surface of this
torus-like structure is a natural place for the BLR. The BLR CF is mostly set
by the gas metallicity, the radiative accretion efficiency, a dynamic
configuration, and ablation by the incident optical-UV continuum. This model
predicts that the BLR should extend inwards of $R_{\rm BLR}$ to the disc radius
where the surface temperature is $\simeq 2000$ K, which occurs at $R_{\rm
in}\simeq 0.18 R_{\rm BLR}$. The value of $R_{\rm in}$ can be tested by
reverberation mapping of the higher ionisation lines, predicted by RPC to peak
well inside $R_{\rm BLR}$. The dust inflated disc scenario can also be tested
based on the predicted response of $R_{\rm BLR}$ and the CF to changes in the
AGN luminosity and accretion rate.

of small particles produced in a collisional cascade inside the Roche limit of
a 0.6 Msun white dwarf. Adding solids with radius \r0\ at a constant rate
$\dot{M}_0$ into a narrow annulus leads to two distinct types of evolution.
When $\dot{M}_0 > \dot{M}_{0,crit}$ = $3 \times 10^4 ~ (r_0 / {\rm

where the mass transfer rate of gas onto the white dwarf is roughly $\dot{M}_0$
and the mass in gas is $M_g \approx 2.3 \times 10^{22} ~ (\dot{M}_0 /
10^{10}~g~s^{-1}) ~ ({\rm 1500~K} / T_0) ~ (10^{-3} / \alpha)$~g, where $T_0$
is the temperature of the gas near the Roche limit and $\alpha$ is the
dimensionless viscosity parameter. If $ \dot{M}_0 < \dot{M}_{0,crit}$, the
system alternates between high states with large mass transfer rates and low
states with negligible accretion. Although either mode of evolution adds
significant amounts of metals to the white dwarf photosphere, none of our
calculations yield a vertically thin ensemble of solids inside the Roche limit.
X-ray observations can place limits on the mass transfer rate and test this
model for metallic line white dwarfs.

The universal applicability of data science tools to a broad range of problems
has generated new opportunities to foster exchange of ideas and computational
workflows across disciplines. In recent years, hack weeks have emerged as an
effective tool for fostering these exchanges by providing training in modern
data analysis workflows. While there are variations in hack week

tutorials in state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning and project work in a
collaborative environment. In this paper, we present the concept of a hack week

successful at cultivating collaboration and the exchange of knowledge.

of the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological
simulation. By separating each galaxy into disk and spheroidal stellar
components and tracing their evolution along the merger tree, we find that the
morphology of galaxies follows a common evolutionary trend. We distinguish
three phases of galaxy formation. These phases are determined primarily by
mass, rather than redshift. For M_star < 10^{9.5} M_sun galaxies grow in a
disorganised way, resulting in a morphology that is dominated by random stellar
motions. This phase is dominated by in-situ star formation, partly triggered by
mergers. In the mass range 10^{9.5} M_sun < M_star < 10^{10.5} M_sun galaxies
evolve towards a disk-dominated morphology, driven by in-situ star formation.
The central spheroid (i.e. the bulge) at z = 0 consists mostly of stars that
formed in-situ, yet the formation of the bulge is to a large degree associated
with mergers. Finally, at M_star > 10^{10.5} M_sun growth through in-situ star
formation slows down considerably and galaxies transform towards a more
spheroidal morphology. This transformation is driven more by the buildup of
spheroids than by the destruction of disks. Spheroid formation in these
galaxies happens mostly by accretion at large radii of stars formed ex-situ
(i.e. the halo rather than the bulge).

that models the distribution of a set of common repeated observations from a
subject through the quantile function, which is regressed on a set of
covariates to determine how these factors affect various aspects of the
underlying subject-specific distribution. To account for smoothness in the
quantile functions, we introduce custom basis functions we call
\textit{quantlets} that are sparse, regularized, near-lossless, and empirically
defined, adapting to the features of a given data set and containing a Gaussian
subspace so {non-Gaussianness} can be assessed. While these quantlets could be
used within various functional regression frameworks, we build a Bayesian
framework that uses nonlinear shrinkage of quantlet coefficients to regularize
the functional regression coefficients and allows fully Bayesian inferences
after fitting a Markov chain Monte Carlo. Specifically, we apply global tests
to assess which covariates have any effect on the distribution at all, followed
by local tests to identify at which specific quantiles the differences lie
while adjusting for multiple testing, and to assess whether the covariate
affects certain major aspects of the distribution, including location, scale,
skewness, Gaussianness, or tails. If the difference lies in these commonly-used
summaries, our approach can still detect them, but our systematic modeling
strategy can also detect effects on other aspects of the distribution that
might be missed if one restricted attention to pre-chosen summaries. We
demonstrate the benefit of the basis space modeling through simulation studies,
and illustrate the method using a biomedical imaging data set in which we
relate the distribution of pixel intensities from a tumor image to various
demographic, clinical, and genetic characteristics.

2011, following its 2004 major bursting episode and GF. SGR 1806-20 has not

the NuSTAR data. The pulse profile is complex with a pulsed fraction of
$\sim8\%$ with no indication of energy dependence. The NuSTAR spectra are well
fit with an absorbed blackbody, $kT=0.62\pm0.06$ keV, plus a power-law,
$\Gamma=1.33\pm0.03$. We find no evidence for variability among the 5

range is a factor of $\sim2$ weaker than the long-term average measured between

boson $Z'$ and an additional SM singlet Higgs with mass $\simeq M_{Z'}$,
together with their superpartners. In the UMSSM the right sneutrino is charged
under the extra $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry; it can therefore annihilate via gauge
interactions. In particular, for $M_{\tilde \nu_R} \simeq M_{Z'}/2$ the
sneutrinos can annihilate by the exchange of (nearly) on--shell gauge or Higgs

GLSM realizations of maps including Veronese and Segre embeddings, which can be
applied to give GLSMs explicitly describing constructions such as the
intersection of one hypersurface with the image under some map of another. We
also discuss GLSMs for intersections of Grassmannians and Pfaffians with one
another, and with their images under various maps, which sometimes form exotic

examples of GLSMs for intersections of Grassmannians G(2,N) with themselves
after a linear rotation, including the Calabi-Yau case N=5. One phase of the
GLSM realizes an intersection of two Grassmannians, the other phase realizes an
intersection of two Pfaffians. The GLSM has two nonabelian factors in its gauge
group, and we consider dualities in those factors. In both the original GLSM
and a double-dual, one geometric phase is realized perturbatively (as the
critical locus of a superpotential), and the other via quantum effects.
Dualizing on a single gauge group factor yields a model in which each geometry
is realized through a simultaneous combination of perturbative and quantum
effects.

can even reduce separation performance as instruments in real music are
strongly correlated. The key concept in our approach is that source estimates

Based on this idea, we drive the separator towards outputs deemed as realistic

widely applicable as it does not assume a specific network architecture or

increasingly applied in the field of biomedical imaging. One of the challenges
in performing the multimodal analysis is that there exist multiple schemes for
fusing the information from different modalities, where such schemes are
application-dependent and lack a unified framework to guide their designs. In
this work we firstly propose a conceptual architecture for the image fusion
schemes in supervised biomedical image analysis: fusing at the feature level,
fusing at the classifier level, and fusing at the decision-making level.
Further, motivated by the recent success in applying deep learning for natural
image analysis, we implement the three image fusion schemes above based on the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with varied structures, and combined into a
single framework. The proposed image segmentation framework is capable of
analyzing the multi-modality images using different fusing schemes
simultaneously. The framework is applied to detect the presence of soft tissue

the results that while all the fusion schemes outperform the single-modality
schemes, fusing at the feature level can generally achieve the best performance
in terms of both accuracy and computational cost, but also suffers from the
decreased robustness in the presence of large errors in any image modalities.

quantitate anomaly score to rank the wait times patterns across the three
bridges for each vehicle type and each direction. By analyzing the top three
most abnormal patterns, we find that there are at least two factors
contributing the anomaly of the patterns. The weekends and holidays may cause
unusual heave congestions at the three bridges at the same time, and the
freight transportation demand may be uneven from Canada to the USA at Peace
Bridge and Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, which may lead to a high anomaly score.
By calculating the frequency of the top 5% abnormal patterns by hour of the
day, the results show that for cars from the USA to Canada, the frequency of
abnormal waiting time patterns is the highest during noon while for trucks in
the same direction, it is the highest during the afternoon peak hours. For
Canada to US direction, the frequency of abnormal border wait time patterns for
both cars and trucks reaches to the peak during the afternoon. The analysis of
abnormal spatial-temporal wait times patterns is promising to improve the

hydrogen-rich progenitors are too large to fit. The physical processes
responsible for the stripping process and the fate of the companion are still
very poorly understood.
  Aiming to find new clues, we investigate Cas~A, which is a very young
($\sim$340 \,yr) and near ($\sim$3.4\,kpc) remnant of a core collapse
supernova. Cas~A has been subject to several searches for possible companions,
all unsuccessfully. We present new measurements of the proper motions and
photometry of stars in the vicinity based on deep HST ACS/WFC and WFC3-IR data.
We identify stellar sources that are close enough in projection, but using
their proper motions we show that none are compatible with being at the
location of center at the time of explosion, in agreement with earlier
findings.
  Our photometric measurements allow us to place much deeper (order of
magnitude) upper limits on the brightness of possible undetected companions. We
systematically compare them with model predictions for a wide variety of
scenarios. We can confidently rule out the presence of any stellar companion of
any reasonable mass and age (main sequence, pre main sequence or stripped).
Although this finding is not in direct conflict with model predictions, it does
rule out what many considered to be the most likely evolutionary scenario for
type IIb supernova. (abstract abbreviated)

trispectrum of the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
anisotropies. The patchy reionization leads to anisotropies in the CMB optical
depth, and the statistics of the observed CMB anisotropies is altered. We
estimate the trispectrum of the CMB temperature anisotropies to constrain
spatial variation of the optical depth. We show that the measured trispectrum
is consistent with that from the standard lensed CMB simulation at $2\sigma$.
While no evidence of the patchy reionization is found in the Planck 2015
temperature trispectrum, the CMB constraint on the patchy reionization is
significantly improved from previous works. Assuming the analytic bubble-halo
model of Wang and Hu (2006), the constraint obtained in this work rules out the
typical bubble size at the ionization fraction of $\sim0.5$ as $R\gtrsim 10$

distinct properties proposed to ensure radial localization of collisionless

The particles move in an intrinsically three dimensional equilibrium whose
representation is given by earlier work of Weitzner and its extension here. For
deeply trapped particles a local equilibrium expansion around a minimum of the
magnetic field strength along a magnetic line suffices. This analytical
non-symmetric equilibrium solution, enables explicit representation of the
constraints. The results show that it is far easier to satisfy the omnigeneity
condition than the quasisymmetry requirement. Correspondingly, there exists a
large class of equilibrium close to quasisymmetry that remain omnigeneous while
allowing inclusion of error fields, which may destroy quasisymmetry.

that bind quarks and gluons into nucleons and that bind nucleons into nuclei.
Predictive control of QCD would allow nuclear structure and reactions as well
as properties of supernovae and neutron stars to be theoretically studied from
first principles. Lattice QCD can represent generic QCD predictions in terms of
well-defined path integrals, but the sign and signal-to-noise problems have
obstructed lattice QCD calculations of large nuclei and nuclear matter in
practice. This thesis presents a statistical study of lattice QCD correlation
functions, with a particular focus on characterizing the structure of the noise
associated with quantum fluctuations. The signal-to-noise problem in baryon
correlation functions is demonstrated to arise from a sign problem associated
with Monte Carlo sampling of complex correlation functions. The phases of
complex correlation functions are analyzed in the framework of circular
statistics, and the time evolution of the phase is shown to resemble a
heavy-tailed random walk on the unit circle. Building on these observations, a
new technique called phase reweighting is investigated that involves
calculations of phase differences over fixed-length time intervals. Phase
reweighting allows results for hadronic observables to be extracted from
large-time correlation functions with constant signal-to-noise ratios. The
signal-to-noise problem re-emerges as the length of the phase-difference
interval is increased. Applications of phase reweighting to meson, baryon, and
two-baryon systems are discussed.

of upper and lower bounds on the exact stretch factor have been obtained but

error is measured by the Kendall $\tau$ distance. In the probabilistic
formulation of the 'Learning to Order' problem we propose, which extends the
framework for statistical Kemeny ranking aggregation developped in
\citet{CKS17}, this boils down to recovering conditional Kemeny medians of
$\Sigma$ given $X$ from i.i.d. training examples $(X_1, \Sigma_1),\; \ldots,\;
(X_N, \Sigma_N)$. For this reason, this statistical learning problem is
referred to as \textit{ranking median regression} here. Our contribution is
twofold. We first propose a probabilistic theory of ranking median regression:
the set of optimal elements is characterized, the performance of empirical risk
minimizers is investigated in this context and situations where fast learning
rates can be achieved are also exhibited. Next we introduce the concept of
local consensus/median, in order to derive efficient methods for ranking median
regression. The major advantage of this local learning approach lies in its
close connection with the widely studied Kemeny aggregation problem. From an
algorithmic perspective, this permits to build predictive rules for ranking
median regression by implementing efficient techniques for (approximate) Kemeny
median computations at a local level in a tractable manner. In particular,
versions of $k$-nearest neighbor and tree-based methods, tailored to ranking
median regression, are investigated. Accuracy of piecewise constant ranking
median regression rules is studied under a specific smoothness assumption for

coupled to comprehensive semi-analytic models of the binary merger process.
Using mock pulsar timing arrays (PTA) with, for the first time, varying
red-noise models, we calculate plausible detection prospects for GW single
sources and the stochastic GW background (GWB). Contrary to previous results,
we find that single sources are at least as detectable as the GW background.
Using mock PTA, we find that these 'foreground' sources (also
'deterministic'/'continuous') are likely to be detected with $\sim 20 \,
\textrm{yr}$ total observing baselines. Detection prospects, and indeed the
overall properties of single sources, are only moderately sensitive to binary
evolution parameters---namely eccentricity & environmental coupling, which can
lead to differences of $\sim 5 \,\textrm{yr}$ in times to detection. Red noise
has a stronger effect, roughly doubling the time to detection of the foreground
between a white-noise only model ($\sim 10$ - $15 \, \textrm{yr}$) and severe
red noise ($\sim 20$ - $30 \, \textrm{yr}$). The effect of red noise on the GWB
is even stronger, suggesting that single source detections may be more robust.
We find that typical signal-to-noise ratios for the foreground peak near $f =
0.1 \, \textrm{yr}^{-1}$, and are much less sensitive to the continued addition

of the well-known finite element code ABAQUS. Quasi-static crack initiation and
growth in planar FGMs is evaluated. Computational results of fracture
parameters are compared to experimental results and good agreement is obtained.
The importance of the numerical fit of the elastic properties in the FE model
is analyzed in depth by means of a sensitivity study and a novel method is
presented. Several key computational issues derived from the continuous change
of the material properties are also addressed and the source code of a user
subroutine USDFLD is provided in the Appendix for an effective implementation
of the property variation. The crack propagation path is calculated through the
extended finite element method and subsequently compared to available
experimental data. Suitability of local fracture criteria to simulate crack
trajectories in FGMs is discussed and a new crack propagation criterion is
suggested.

without the support of rigorous evidence due to the cost and complexity of

other ways that affect outcomes. Many causal inference methods have been
developed to mitigate these biases. However, there is no way to know which
method might produce the best estimate of a treatment effect in a given study.
In analogy to cross-validation, which estimates the prediction error of
predictive models applied to a given dataset, we propose synth-validation, a
procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods
applied to a given dataset. In synth-validation, we use the observed data to
estimate generative distributions with known treatment effects. We apply each
causal inference method to datasets sampled from these distributions and
compare the effect estimates with the known effects to estimate error. Using
simulations, we show that using synth-validation to select a causal inference

radio luminosities and the spread of their radio-loudness is very large at any

efficiencies which can result from the spread of the black hole spins and
magnetic fluxes. Magnetic fluxes can be developed stochastically in the
innermost zones of accretion discs, or can be advected to the central regions
prior to the AGN phase. In the latter case there could be systematic
differences between the properties of galaxies hosting radio-loud (RL) and
radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs. In the former case the differences should be negligible
for objects having the same Eddington ratio. To study the problem we decided to
conduct a comparison study of host galaxy properties of RL and RQ AGNs. In this
study we selected type II AGNs from SDSS spectroscopic catalogues. Our RL AGN
sample consists of the AGNs appearing in the Best & Heckman (2012) catalogue of
radio galaxies. To compare RL and RQ galaxies that have the same AGN parameters
we matched the galaxies in black hole mass, Eddington ratio and redshift. We
compared several properties of the host galaxies in these two groups of objects
like galaxy mass, colour, concentration index, line widths, morphological type
and interaction signatures. We found that in the studied group RL AGNs are
preferentially hosted by elliptical galaxies while RQ ones are hosted by
galaxies of later type. We also found that the fraction of interacting galaxies
is the same in both groups of AGNs. These results suggest that the magnetic
flux in RL AGNs is advected to the nucleus prior to the AGN phase.

theory and its elastically collective generalization (ECNLE theory) of
activated dynamics in bulk spherical particle liquids to address the influence
of random particle pinning on structural relaxation. The simplest neutral
confinement model is analyzed for hard spheres where there is no change of the
equilibrium pair structure upon particle pinning. As the pinned fraction grows,
cage scale dynamical constraints are intensified in a manner that increases
with density. This results in the mobile particles becoming more transiently
localized, with increases of the jump distance, cage scale barrier and NLE
theory mean hopping time; subtle changes of the dynamic shear modulus are
predicted. The results are contrasted with recent simulations. Similarities in
relaxation behavior are identified in the dynamic precursor regime, including a
roughly exponential, or weakly supra-exponential, growth of the alpha time with
pinning fraction and a reduction of dynamic fragility. However, the increase of
the alpha time with pinning predicted by the local NLE theory is too small, and
severely so at very high volume fractions. The strong deviations are argued to
be due to the longer range collective elasticity aspect of the problem which is
expected to be modified by random pinning in a complex manner. A qualitative
physical scenario is offered for how the three distinct aspects that quantify
the elastic barrier may change with pinning. ECNLE theory calculations of the
alpha time are then presented based on the simplest effective-medium-like
treatment for how random pinning modifies the elastic barrier. The results
appear to be consistent with most, but not all, trends seen in recent
simulations. Key open problems are discussed with regards to both theory and
simulation.

relativistic hydrodynamics. Here is discussed how this symmetry is properly
implemented using the prescription of minimal coupling: $\partial\to \partial
+\omega \mathcal{A}$. It is shown that this prescription has no problem to deal
with curvature since it gives the correct expressions for the commutator of
covariant derivatives.
  In the hydrodynamics the Weyl gauge connection emerges from the degrees of
freedom of the fluid: it is a combination of the expansion and entropy
gradient. The remaining degrees of the fluid and the metric tensor are see in
this context as charged fields under the Weyl gauge connection. The gauge
nature of conformal hydrodynamics is emphasized and a charge for the Weyl
connection is defined. A notion of local charge and current densities are
considered and a local charge conservation law is reached.

processors, and whose processing time depends on the number of processors
allotted to it. A moldable job is monotone if its work doesn't decrease for an
increasing number of allotted processors. We consider the problem of scheduling
monotone moldable jobs to minimize the makespan.
  We argue that for certain compact input encodings a polynomial algorithm has
a running time polynomial in n and log(m), where n is the number of jobs and m
is the number of machines. We describe how monotony of jobs can be used to
counteract the increased problem complexity that arises from compact encodings,
and give tight bounds on the approximability of the problem with compact
encoding: it is NP-hard to solve optimally, but admits a PTAS.
  The main focus of this work are efficient approximation algorithms. We
describe different techniques to exploit the monotony of the jobs for better
running times, and present a (3/2+{\epsilon})-approximate algorithm whose
running time is polynomial in log(m) and 1/{\epsilon}, and only linear in the

the superconducting state, has been subject to strong controversy in high-Tc
copper-oxides. Since the issue has been tackled almost exclusively by
macroscopic techniques so far, there is a clear need for local-probe
measurements. Here, we use 17O NMR to measure the spin susceptibility
$\chi_{spin}$ of the CuO2 planes at low temperature in charge ordered
YBa2Cu3Oy. We find that $\chi_{spin}$ increases (most likely linearly) with
magnetic field H and saturates above field values ranging from 20 to 40 T. This
result is consistent with Hc2 values claimed by G. Grissonnanche et al. [Nat.
Commun. 5, 3280 (2014)] and with the interpretation that the
charge-density-wave (CDW) reduces Hc2 in underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy. Furthermore, the
absence of marked deviation in $\chi_{spin}(H)$ at the onset of long-range CDW
order indicates that this Hc2 reduction and the Fermi-surface reconstruction
are primarily rooted in the short-range CDW order already present in zero
field, not in the field-induced long-range CDWorder. Above Hc2, the relatively
low values of $\chi_{spin}$ at T=2 K show that the pseudogap is a ground-state
property, independent of the superconducting gap.

$O(K(m+|AFF|))$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the old graph, and $|AFF|

(RFI) in radio interferometric imaging data. The first algorithm utilizes the
redundancy of visibilities inside a UV cell in the visibility plane to identify
corrupted data, while varying the detection threshold in accordance with the
observed reduction in noise with radial UV distance. In the second algorithm,
we propose a scheme to detect faint RFI in the visibility time-channel plane of
baselines. The efficacy of identifying RFI in the residual visibilities is
reduced by the presence of ripples due to inaccurate subtraction of the
strongest sources. This can be due to several reasons including primary beam
asymmetries and other direction dependent calibration errors. We eliminated
these ripples by clipping the corresponding peaks in the associated Fourier
plane. RFI was detected in the ripple-free time-channel plane but was flagged
in the original visibilities. Application of these two algorithms to 5
different 150 MHz datasets from the GMRT resulted in a reduction in image noise
of 20-50% throughout the field along with a reduction in systematics and a
corresponding increase in the number of detected sources. However, on comparing
the mean flux densities before and after flagging RFI we find a differential
change with the fainter sources ($25\sigma <$ S $< 100$ mJy) showing a change
of -6% to +1% relative to the stronger sources (S $>$ 100 mJy). We are unable
to explain this effect but it could be related to the CLEAN bias known for
interferometers.

the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads
to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and
avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of molecules
into the channel. This work first derives the maximum likelihood (ML) detector
for a binary MC system with reactive signaling molecules under the assumption
that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI. The performance of this
genie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any
practical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different
complexity are proposed. The proposed ML detector as well as one of the
suboptimal detectors require the channel response (CR) of the considered MC
system. Moreover, the CR is needed for the performance evaluation of all
proposed detectors. However, analyzing MC with reactive signaling is
challenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe
the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, an
algorithm is developed in this paper for efficient computation of the CR to any
arbitrary transmit symbol sequence. The accuracy of this algorithm is validated
via particle-based simulation. Simulation results using the developed CR
algorithm show that the performance of the proposed suboptimal detectors can
approach that of the genie- aided ML detector. Moreover, these results show
that MC systems with reactive signaling have superior performance relative to
those with non-reactive signaling due to the reduction of ISI enabled by the
chemical reactions.

d-dimensional cumulants directly through quasi-local manipulations of the wave
function, avoiding the complexity of 2d-dimensional phase space. We perform for
the first time a quantitive comparison of the ScM and a conventional Vlasov
solver in d=2 dimensions. Our numerical tests were carried out using two types
of cold cosmological initial conditions: the classic collapse of a sine wave

qualitative and quantitative agreement between these codes, demonstrating the
feasibility and advantages of the ScM as an alternative to N-body simulations.

integral role in drug repositioning: the discovery of new uses for existing
drugs. One popular method of drug repositioning is network-based DTI
prediction, which uses complex network theory to predict DTIs from a
drug-target network. Currently, most network-based DTI prediction is based on
machine learning methods such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) or Support
Vector Machines (SVM). These methods require additional information about the
characteristics of drugs, targets and DTIs, such as chemical structure, genome
sequence, binding types, causes of interactions, etc., and do not perform
satisfactorily when such information is unavailable. We propose a new,
alternative method for DTI prediction that makes use of only network topology
information attempting to solve this problem.
  Results: We compare our method for DTI prediction against the well-known RBM
approach. We show that when applied to the MATADOR database, our approach based
on node neighborhoods yield higher precision for high-ranking predictions than
RBM when no information regarding DTI types is available.
  Conclusion: This demonstrates that approaches purely based on network
topology provide a more suitable approach to DTI prediction in the many
real-life situations where little or no prior knowledge is available about the
characteristics of drugs, targets, or their interactions.

  Application to Microbiome Count Data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microorganisms play critical roles in human health and disease. It is well
known that microbes live in diverse communities in which they interact
synergistically or antagonistically. Thus for estimating microbial associations
with clinical covariates, multivariate statistical models are preferred.
Multivariate models allow one to estimate and exploit complex interdependencies
among multiple taxa, yielding more powerful tests of exposure or treatment
effects than application of taxon-specific univariate analyses. In addition,
the analysis of microbial count data requires special attention because data
commonly exhibit zero inflation. To meet these needs, we developed a Bayesian
variable selection model for multivariate count data with excess zeros that
incorporates information on the covariance structure of the outcomes (counts
for multiple taxa), while estimating associations with the mean levels of these
outcomes. Although there has been a great deal of effort in zero-inflated
models for longitudinal data, little attention has been given to
high-dimensional multivariate zero-inflated data modeled via a general
correlation structure. Through simulation, we compared performance of the
proposed method to that of existing univariate approaches, for both the binary
and count parts of the model. When outcomes were correlated the proposed
variable selection method maintained type I error while boosting the ability to
identify true associations in the binary component of the model. For the count
part of the model, in some scenarios the the univariate method had higher power
than the multivariate approach. This higher power was at a cost of a highly
inflated false discovery rate not observed with the proposed multivariate
method. We applied the approach to oral microbiome data from the Pediatric
HIV/AIDS Cohort Oral Health Study and identified five species (of 44)
associated with HIV infection.

The CFS signature scheme has certain drawbacks in terms of scaling of the
parameters and a lack of existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen
message attacks (EUF-CMA) security proof. Further, the proposed modified RM
code-based signature scheme can use complete decoding, which can be implemented
using a recursive decoding method, and thus syndromes for errors larger than
the error correctability can be decoded for signing, which improves the
probability of successful signing and reduces the signing time. Using the
puncturing and insertion methods, the proposed RM code-based signature scheme
can avoid some known attacks for RM code-based cryptosystems. The parameters of
the proposed signature scheme such as error weight parameter $w$ and the
maximum signing trial $N$, can be adjusted in terms of signing time and
security level, and it is also proved that the proposed signature scheme

means of evaluating the corresponding GP. Recently, kernel functions which
mimic multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside

prediction with a deep neural network.
  In this work, we derive the exact equivalence between infinitely wide deep

perform Bayesian inference for wide deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10.
We observe that trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the
corresponding GP with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is
strongly correlated with trained network prediction error. We further find that
test performance increases as finite-width trained networks are made wider and
more similar to a GP, and thus that GP predictions typically outperform those
of finite-width networks. Finally we connect the performance of these GPs to
the recent theory of signal propagation in random neural networks.

coronal mass ejections to small coronal-hole jets, is that the lowest-lying
magnetic flux in the Sun's corona undergoes the continual buildup of stress and
free energy. This magnetic stress has long been observed as the phenomenon of
""filament channels:"" strongly sheared magnetic field localized around
photospheric polarity inversion lines. However, the mechanism for the stress
buildup - the formation of filament channels - is still debated. We present
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal volume that is driven by
transient, cellular boundary flows designed to model the processes by which the
photosphere drives the corona. The key feature of our simulations is that they
accurately preserve magnetic helicity, the topological quantity that is
conserved even in the presence of ubiquitous magnetic reconnection. Although
small-scale random stress is injected everywhere at the photosphere, driving
stochastic reconnection throughout the corona, the net result of the magnetic
evolution is a coherent shearing of the lowest-lying field lines. This highly
counter-intuitive result - magnetic stress builds up locally rather than
spreading out to attain a minimum energy state - explains the formation of
filament channels and is the fundamental mechanism underlying SEEs.
Furthermore, this mechanism may be relevant to other astrophysical or
laboratory plasmas.

spread of an SI process on a known graph, where we have a limited budget to use
to transition infected nodes back to the susceptible state (i.e., to cure
nodes). Recent work has demonstrated that under perfect and instantaneous
information (which nodes are/are not infected), the budget required for curing
a graph precisely depends on a combinatorial property called the CutWidth. We
show that this assumption is in fact necessary: even a minor degradation of
perfect information, e.g., a diagnostic test that is 99% accurate, drastically
alters the landscape. Infections that could previously be cured in sublinear
time now may require exponential time, or orderwise larger budget to cure. The
crux of the issue comes down to a tension not present in the full information
case: if a node is suspected (but not certain) to be infected, do we risk
wasting our budget to try to cure an uninfected node, or increase our certainty
by longer observation, at the risk that the infection spreads further? Our
results present fundamental, algorithm-independent bounds that tradeoff budget
required vs. uncertainty.

gravitationally unstable and self-shielded against ionizing radiation, whereas
extended outer discs with little or no star formation tend to be stable and
unshielded on average. We explore what drives the transition between these two
regimes, specifically whether discs first meet the conditions for
self-shielding (parameterized by dust optical depth, $\tau$) or gravitational
instability (parameterized by a modified version of Toomre's instability
parameters, $Q_{\rm thermal}$, which quantifies the stability of a gas disc
that is thermally supported at $T=10^4$ K). We first introduce a new metric
formed by the product of these quantities, $Q_{\rm thermal}\tau$, which
indicates whether the conditions for disk instability or self-shielding are
easier to meet in a given region of a galaxy, and we discuss how $Q_{\rm
thermal}\tau$ can be constrained even in the absence of direct gas information.
We then analyse a sample of 13 galaxies with resolved gas measurements and find
that on average galaxies will reach the threshold for disk instabilities
($Q_{\rm thermal}<1$) before reaching the threshold for self-shielding
($\tau>1$). Using integral field spectroscopic observations of a sample of 236
galaxies from the MaNGA survey, we find that the value of $Q_{\rm thermal}\tau$
in star-forming discs is consistent with similar behavior. These results
support a scenario where disc fragmentation and collapse occurs before
self-shielding, suggesting that gravitational instabilities are the primary
condition for widespread star formation in galaxy discs. Our results support
similar conclusions based on recent galaxy simulations.

to answer the question according to the passage. However, in the situation of
interacting with machines by means of text, people are more likely to raise a
query in form of several keywords rather than a complete sentence. The
keyword-based query comprehension is a new challenge, because small variations
to a question may completely change its semantical information, thus yield
different answers. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network system that
consists a Demand Optimization Model based on a passage-attention neural
machine translation and a Reader Model that can find the answer given the
optimized question. The Demand Optimization Model optimizes the original query
and output multiple reconstructed questions, then the Reader Model takes the
new questions as input and locate the answers from the passage. To make
predictions robust, an evaluation mechanism will score the reconstructed
questions so the final answer strike a good balance between the quality of both
the Demand Optimization Model and the Reader Model. Experimental results on
several datasets show that our framework significantly improves multiple strong
baselines on this challenging task.

appear that preserve the initial spacing, and the spectra are suggestive of
harmonically phase-locked waveforms. We present a theory of the instability
that applies to all homogeneously broadened standing-wave lasers. The low
instability threshold and the large sideband spacing can be explained by the
combination of an unclamped, incoherent Lorentzian gain due to the population
grating, and a coherent parametric gain caused by temporal population
pulsations that changes the spectral gain line shape. The parametric term
suppresses the gain of sidebands whose separation is much smaller than the
reciprocal gain recovery time, while enhancing the gain of more distant
sidebands. The large gain recovery frequency of the QCL compared to the FSR is
essential to observe this parametric effect, which is responsible for the
multiple-FSR sideband separation. We predict that by tuning the strength of the
incoherent gain contribution, for example by engineering the modal overlap
factors and the carrier diffusion, both amplitude-modulated (AM) or
frequency-modulated emission can be achieved from QCLs. We provide initial
evidence of an AM waveform emitted by a QCL with highly asymmetric facet
reflectivities, thereby opening a promising route to ultrashort pulse
generation in the mid-infrared. Together, the experiments and theory clarify a
deep connection between parametric oscillation in optically pumped
microresonators and the single-mode instability of lasers, tying together
literature from the last 60 years.

employing dimension reduction to network response dynamics evoked by stimuli
applied to each neuron separately. The outcome model captures how stimuli
propagate through the network and thus represents functional dependencies
between neurons, i.e., functional connectome. The benefit of using a PGM as the
functional connectome is that posterior inference can be done efficiently and
circumvent the complexities in direct inference of response pathways in dynamic
neuronal networks. In particular, posterior inference reveals the relations
between known stimuli and downstream neurons or allows to query which stimuli
are associated with downstream neurons. For validation and as an example for
our approach we apply our methodology to a model of Caenorhabiditis elegans
nervous system which structure and dynamics are well-studied. From its
dynamical model we collect time series of the network response and use singular
value decomposition to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the time series
data. We then extract dominant patterns in each data matrix to get pairwise
dependency information and create a graphical model for the full somatic

pathways dominant for known behavioral scenarios and to detect possible

change the morphology of Large Area Field Emitters (LAFEs). This phenomenon
affects the electrostatic interactions between adjacent sites on a LAFE during
field emission and may lead to several consequences, such as: the emitter's
degradation, diffusion of absorbed particles on the emitter's surface,
deflection due to electrostatic forces and mechanical stress. These
consequences are undesirable for technological applications, since they may
significantly affect the macroscopic current density on the LAFE. Despite the
technological importance, these processes are not completely understood yet.
Moreover, the electrostatic effects due to the proximity between emitters on a
LAFE may compete with the morphological ones. The balance between these effects
may lead to a non trivial behavior in the apex-Field Enhancement Factor (FEF).
The present work intends to study the interplay between proximity and
morphological effects by studying a model amenable for an analytical treatment.
In order to do that, a conducting system under an external electrostatic field,
with a profile limited by two mirror-reflected triangular protrusions on an
infinite line, is considered. The FEF near the apex of each emitter is obtained
as a function of their shape and the distance between them via a
Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. Our results suggest that a tradeoff between
morphological and proximity effects on a LAFE may provide an explanation for
the observed reduction of the local FEF and its variation at small distances

Optimizing a low-precision network is very challenging since the training

substantial accuracy loss. To mitigate this problem, we propose three
simple-yet-effective approaches to improve the network training. First, we
propose to use a two-stage optimization strategy to progressively find good
local minima. Specifically, we propose to first optimize a net with quantized
weights and then quantized activations. This is in contrast to the traditional
methods which optimize them simultaneously. Second, following a similar spirit
of the first method, we propose another progressive optimization approach which
progressively decreases the bit-width from high-precision to low-precision
during the course of training. Third, we adopt a novel learning scheme to
jointly train a full-precision model alongside the low-precision one. By doing
so, the full-precision model provides hints to guide the low-precision model
training. Extensive experiments on various datasets ( i.e., CIFAR-100 and
ImageNet) show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. To highlight, using
our methods to train a 4-bit precision network leads to no performance decrease

the power grid (e.g., universities, hospitals and householdes) via solar
panels, wind turbines or local generators in the past decade. With local
energy, such electricity consumers can be considered as ""microgrids"" which can
simulataneously generate and consume energy. Some microgrids may have excessive
energy that can be shared to other power consumers on the grid. To this end,
all the entities have to share their local private information (e.g., their
local demand, local supply and power quality data) to each other or a
third-party to find and implement the optimal energy sharing solution. However,
such process is constrained by privacy concerns raised by the microgrids. In
this paper, we propose a privacy preserving scheme for all the microgrids which
can securely implement their energy sharing against both semi-honest and
colluding adversaries. The proposed approach includes two secure communication
protocols that can ensure quantified privacy leakage and handle collusions.

Their synthesis problem has important applications in the design of digital
hardware and commercial processes. Given a labeled transition system (TS) $A$,
feasibility is the NP-complete decision problem whether $A$ can be equivalently
synthesized into an ENS. It is well known that $A$ is feasible if and only if
it has the event state separation property (ESSP) and the state separation
property (SSP). Recently, these properties have also been studied individually
for their practical implications. A fast ESSP algorithm, for instance, would
allow applications to at least validate the language equivalence of $A$ and a
synthesized ENS. Being able to efficiently decide SSP, on the other hand, could
serve as a quick-fail preprocessing mechanism for synthesis. Although a few
tractable subclasses have been found, this paper destroys much of the hope that
many practically meaningful input restrictions make feasibility or at least one
of ESSP and SSP efficient. We show that all three problems remain NP-complete

three times or if the input is restricted to TSs where each event occurs at

explore its relations with the cycle strength. With the progress of the solar
cycle, the distributions in two hemispheres from mid-latitudes propagate toward
the equator and then (before the usual solar minimum) these two distributions
touch each other. By visualizing the evolution of the distributions in two
hemispheres, we separate the solar cycles by excluding this hemispheric
overlap. From these isolated solar cycles in two hemispheres, we generate
latitude distributions for each cycle, starting from cycle 8 to cycle 23. We
find that the parameters of these distributions, namely, the central latitude
($C$), width ($\delta$) and height ($H$) evolve with the cycle number and they
show some hemispheric asymmetries. Although the asymmetries in these parameters
persist for a few successive cycles, they get corrected within a few cycles and
the new asymmetries appear again. In agreement with the previous study, we find
that distribution parameters are correlated with the strengths of the cycles,
although these correlations are significantly different in two hemispheres. The
general trend that stronger cycles begin sunspot eruptions at relatively higher
latitudes and have wider bands of sunspot emergence latitudes are confirmed
when combining the data from two hemispheres. We explore these features using a
flux transport dynamo model with stochastic fluctuations. We find that these
features are correctly reproduced in this model. The solar cycle evolution of
the distribution center is also in good agreement with observations. Possible
explanations of the observed features based on this dynamo model are presented.

relation clearly exists at $z\sim2.3$. The strength of this relation is similar
to predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. By performing a
direct comparison of stacks of $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2.3$ galaxies, we find that
$z\sim2.3$ galaxies have $\sim0.1$ dex lower metallicity at fixed M$_*$ and
SFR. In the context of chemical evolution models, this evolution of the
M$_*$-SFR-Z relation suggests an increase with redshift of the mass-loading
factor at fixed M$_*$, as well as a decrease in the metallicity of infalling
gas that is likely due to a lower importance of gas recycling relative to
accretion from the intergalactic medium at high redshifts. Performing this
analysis simultaneously with multiple metallicity-sensitive line ratios allows
us to rule out the evolution in physical conditions (e.g., N/O ratio,
ionization parameter, and hardness of the ionizing spectrum) at fixed

The representation multiset of a vertex $v$ with respect to $W$ (which is a

of distances between $v$ and the vertices in $W$. If $r_m (u |W) \neq r_m(v|W)$

because of their effectiveness in various information retrieval tasks. The goal
is to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in an information
network and simultaneously capture and preserve the network structure. Critical
to the performance of a network embedding method is how the edges/vertexes of
the network is sampled for the learning process. Many existing methods adopt a
uniform sampling method to reduce learning complexity, but when the network is
non-uniform (i.e. a weighted network) such uniform sampling incurs information
loss. The goal of this paper is to present a generalized vertex sampling
framework that works seamlessly with most existing network embedding methods to
support weighted instead of uniform vertex/edge sampling. For efficiency, we
propose a delicate sequential vertex-to-context graph data structure, such that
sampling a training pair for learning takes only constant time. For scalability
and memory efficiency, we design the graph data structure in a way that keeps
space consumption low without requiring additional space. In addition to
implementing existing network embedding methods, the proposed framework can be
used to implement extensions that feature high-order proximity modeling and
weighted relation modeling. Experiments conducted on three datasets, including
a commercial large-scale one, verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed weighted network embedding methods on a variety of tasks, including
word similarity search, multi-label classification, and item recommendation.

are human-annotated with 527 sound category labels. Audio classification
experiments with the balanced training set and the evaluation set of AudioSet
are carried out by applying different types of neural network models. The
classification performance and the model complexity of these models are
compared and analyzed. While the CNN models show better performance than MLP
and RNN, its model complexity is relatively high and undesirable for practical
use. We propose two different strategies that aim at constructing
low-dimensional embedding feature extractors and hence reducing the number of
model parameters. It is shown that the simplified CNN model has only 1/22 model
parameters of the original model, with only a slight degradation of
performance.

the ubiquitous use of graph processing in various domains. The inherent
\textit{irregularity} in graph applications leads to several challenges for
parallelization. A key challenge, which we address in this paper, is that of
load-imbalance. If the work-assignment to threads uses node-based graph
partitioning, it can result in skewed task-distribution, leading to poor
load-balance. In contrast, if the work-assignment uses edge-based graph
partitioning, the load-balancing is better, but the memory requirement is
relatively higher. This makes it unsuitable for large graphs. In this work, we
propose three techniques for improved load-balancing of graph applications on
GPUs. Each technique brings in unique advantages, and a user may have to employ
a specific technique based on the requirement. Using Breadth First Search and
Single Source Shortest Paths as our processing kernels, we illustrate the
effectiveness of each of the proposed techniques in comparison to the existing
node-based and edge-based mechanisms.

0.1-300 GeV and an error circle of 5.4 arcminute in angular radius. The
gamma-ray spectrum cannot be reproduced by a pure leptonic emission or a pure

The CO-line observations reveal a molecular cloud (MC) at V_LSR~90 km/s, which
demonstrates morphological correspondence with the western boundary of the SNR
brightened in multiwavelength. The 12CO (J=2-1)/12CO (J=1-0) ratio in the left

capable of accounting for the hadronic gamma-ray emission component. The

determination of the effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$, surface gravity
$\log \,g$, microturbulent velocity $\xi_\mathrm{t}$, and a generic metal
abundance $\log\,A$ -- here taken as iron. We calculate a grid of 1D
hydrostatic plane-parallel models covering the ranges in effective temperature

biases of this kind it is favourable to restrict the spectroscopic analysis to
photometric phases $\phi_\mathrm{ph}\approx0.3\ldots 0.65$ using additional
information to fix effective temperature and surface gravity. Hydrostatic 1D
model atmospheres can provide unbiased estimates of stellar parameters and
abundances of Cepheid variables for particular phases of their pulsations. We
identified convective inhomogeneities as the main driver behind potential

novel neural network that takes a pair of RGB-D images as the input and
delivers oriented 3D bounding boxes as the output. The network, named 3D-SSD,
composed of two parts: hierarchical feature fusion and multi-layer prediction.
The hierarchical feature fusion combines appearance and geometric features from
RGB-D images while the multi-layer prediction utilizes multi-scale features for
object detection. As a result, the network can exploit 2.5D representations in
a synergetic way to improve the accuracy and efficiency. The issue of object
sizes is addressed by attaching a set of 3D anchor boxes with varying sizes to
every location of the prediction layers. At the end stage, the category scores
for 3D anchor boxes are generated with adjusted positions, sizes and
orientations respectively, leading to the final detections using non-maximum
suppression. In the training phase, the positive samples are identified with
the aid of 2D ground truth to avoid the noisy estimation of depth from raw
data, which guide to a better converged model. Experiments performed on the
challenging SUN RGB-D dataset show that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art Deep Sliding Shape by 10.2% mAP and 88x faster. Further,

proposing a secure classification approach, whose accuracy is never degenerated

augmented features, we learn various types of classifiers and adapt them by
employing a specially designed robust loss. It provides various candidate
classifiers to meet the following assumption of security operation. Secondly,
we integrate all candidate classifiers by approximately maximizing the
performance improvement. Under a mild assumption, the integrated classifier has
theoretical security guarantee. Several new optimization methods have been
developed to accommodate the problems with proved convergence. Besides
evaluating SEC on 16 data sets, we also apply SEC in the application of
diagnostic classification of schizophrenia since it has vast application
potentiality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEC in both
tackling security problem and discriminating schizophrenic patients from

using optically thin emission lines, we find that the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the hot gas is remarkably low and mostly uniform. The velocity
dispersion reaches maxima of approximately 200~km~s$^{-1}$ toward the central
active galactic nucleus (AGN) and toward the AGN inflated north-western `ghost'
bubble. Elsewhere within the observed region, the velocity dispersion appears
constant around 100~km~s$^{-1}$. We also detect a velocity gradient with a
100~km~s$^{-1}$ amplitude across the cluster core, consistent with large-scale
sloshing of the core gas. If the observed gas motions are isotropic, the
kinetic pressure support is less than 10\% of the thermal pressure support in
the cluster core. The well-resolved optically thin emission lines have Gaussian
shapes, indicating that the turbulent driving scale is likely below 100~kpc,
which is consistent with the size of the AGN jet inflated bubbles. We also

either sub-relativistic or mildly-relativistic velocities. We show that the
observed properties of sGRB 170817A, in particular the high peak energy, can be

scatter in F$_{\rm H\alpha}/$F$_{\rm FUV}$ in HII regions are invariant across
all of these environments. Also, using Starburst99 models, we are able to
qualitatively reproduce the distributions of F$_{\rm H\alpha}/$F$_{\rm FUV}$
throughout these different environments using a standard Kroupa IMF, hence we
find no need to invoke truncations in the upper mass end of the IMF to explain
the young star-forming regions in the M101 Group even at extremely low surface
density. This implies that star formation in low density environments differs
from star formation in high density environments only by intensity and not by
cloud-to-cloud physics.

target image resides only in the user's mind (called ""mental image retrieval""

solve this problem through relevance feedback. Specifically, a new Bayesian
formulation is proposed that simultaneously models the retrieval target and its
high-level representation in the mind of the user (called the ""user metric""

heterogeneous features extracted from multiple clothing attributes,

in computer vision due to its important applications. It remains a challenging
task when input images severe occlusions caused by, e.g., adverse camera views.
Under such circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be
produced. In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting
geometric constraints of landmark point inter-connectivity. To address the
problem, by incorporating priors about the structure of pose components, we
propose a novel structure-aware fully convolutional network to implicitly take
such priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning
of such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, inspired by how human
identifies implausible poses, we design discriminators to distinguish the real
poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible ones). If the pose
generator G generates results that the discriminator fails to distinguish from
real ones, the network successfully learns the priors. Training of the network
follows the strategy of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The
effectiveness of the proposed network is evaluated on three pose-related tasks:
2D single human pose estimation, 2D facial landmark estimation and 3D single
human pose estimation. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods and almost always generates plausible pose
predictions, demonstrating the usefulness of implicit learning of structures
using GANs.

in unrealistically short dense loops. Otherwise they are leaky, losing energy
to their surrounds as outgoing waves. This causes any oscillation to decay
exponentially in time. Simultaneous observations of both period and decay rate
therefore reveal the eigenfrequency of the observed mode, and potentially
insight into the tubes' nonuniform internal structure. In this article, a
global spectral description of the oscillations is presented that results in an
implicit matrix eigenvalue equation where the eigenvalues are associated
predominantly with the diagonal terms of the matrix. The off-diagonal terms
vanish identically if the tube is uniform. A linearized perturbation approach,
applied with respect to a uniform reference model, is developed that makes the
eigenvalues explicit. The implicit eigenvalue problem is easily solved
numerically though, and it is shown that knowledge of the real and imaginary
parts of the eigenfrequency is sufficient to determine the width and density
contrast of a boundary layer over which the tubes' enhanced internal densities
drop to ambient values. Linearized density kernels are developed that show
sensitivity only to the extreme outside of the loops for radial fundamental
modes, especially for small density enhancements, with no sensitivity to the
core. Higher radial harmonics do show some internal sensitivity, but these will
be more difficult to observe. Only kink modes are sensitive to the tube
centres. {Variation in internal and external Alfv\'en speed along the loop is
shown to have little effect on the fundamental dimensionless eigenfrequency,
though the associated eigenfunction becomes more compact at the loop apex as
stratification increases, or may even displace from the apex.

methods (r-adaptive methods) are an important procedure for increasing the
resolution in regions of interest, without modifying the connectivity of the
mesh. Key to the success of these methods is that the mesh should be
sufficiently refined (locally) and flexible in order to resolve evolving
solution features, but at the same time not introduce errors through skewness
and lack of regularity. Some state-of-the-art methods are bottom-up in that
they attempt to prescribe both the local cell size and the alignment to
features of the solution. However, the resulting problem is overdetermined,
necessitating a compromise between these conflicting requirements. An
alternative approach, described in this paper, is to prescribe only the local
cell size and augment this an optimal transport condition to provide global
regularity. This leads to a robust and flexible algorithm for generating meshes
fitted to an evolving solution, with minimal need for tuning parameters. Of
particular interest for geophysical modelling are meshes constructed on the
surface of the sphere. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that meshes
generated on the sphere using this optimal transport approach have good
a-priori regularity and that the meshes produced are naturally aligned to
various simple features. It is further shown that the sphere's intrinsic
curvature leads to more regular meshes than the plane. In addition to these
general results, we provide a wide range of examples relevant to practical
applications, to showcase the behaviour of optimally transported meshes on the
sphere. These range from axisymmetric cases that can be solved analytically to
more general examples that are tackled numerically. Evaluation of the singular

applications. An RFB is governed by electrical, chemical, and fluid dynamics.
The hybrid structure makes the analysis difficult. To analyze transient

change in a concentration of ions in the electrolyte, and simulate the change
with a model which is mainly based on chemical kinetics. The simulation results
introduces transient behaviors of an RFB in a response to a load variation.
There are found three kinds of typical transient behaviors including

continuous-time bipartite networks, the existence of a sufficient statistic
implies that an informational quantity called the sensory capacity takes the
maximum. Since the maximal sensory capacity imposes a constraint that the
energetic efficiency cannot exceed one-half, our result implies that the
existence of a sufficient statistic is inevitably accompanied by energetic
dissipation. We also show that, in a particular parameter region of linear
Langevin systems, there exists the optimal noise intensity, at which the
sensory capacity, the information-thermodynamic efficiency, and the total
entropy production are optimized at the same time. We apply our general result
to a model of sensory adaptation of E. Coli, and find that the sensory capacity
is nearly maximal with experimentally realistic parameters, suggesting that E.

minimizing the run time of the application in the presence of system failures.
Most of the existing efforts on checkpointing interval selection were developed
for sequential applications while few efforts deal with parallel applications
where the applications are executed on the same number of processors for the
entire duration of execution. Some checkpointing systems support parallel
applications where the number of processors on which the applications execute
can be changed during the execution. We refer to these kinds of parallel
applications as {\em malleable} applications. In this paper, we develop a
performance model for malleable parallel applications that estimates the amount
of useful work performed in unit time (UWT) by a malleable application in the
presence of failures as a function of checkpointing interval. We use this
performance model function with different intervals and select the interval
that maximizes the UWT value. By conducting a large number of simulations with
the traces obtained on real supercomputing systems, we show that the
checkpointing intervals determined by our model can lead to high efficiency of
applications in the presence of failures.

$p (= \max_K p_K)$ is the spectral order. This estimate is based on the local

by a simple calculus of the field equations, first we convert the Maxwell's

for the spatial discretization with a second order time scheme, we obtain
optimal convergence of ${\mathcal O}(h^2+k^2)$, where $h$ is the spatial mesh

to undesired oscillations. To understand the nonlinear aspects of this
phenomenon, a turbulent mixing layer over a deep cavity at Reynolds number 150
000 is considered and its response to harmonic forcing is analysed with
large-eddy simulations (LES) and linearised Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE). As
a model of incoming acoustic perturbations, spatially uniform time-harmonic
forcing is applied at the cavity end, with amplitudes in the wide range
0.045-8.9% of the bulk velocity. Compressible LES provide reference nonlinear
responses of the shear layer, and the associated mean flows. Linear responses
are calculated with the incompressible LNSE around the LES mean flows; they
predict well the amplification (both measured with kinetic energy and with a
proxy for vortex sound production) and capture the nonlinear saturation
observed as the forcing amplitude increases and the mixing layer thickens.
Perhaps surprisingly, LNSE calculations based on a monochromatic (single
frequency) assumption yield a good agreement even though higher harmonics and
their nonlinear interaction (Reynolds stresses) are not negligible. However,
the leading Reynolds stresses do not force the mixing layer efficiently, as
shown by a comparison with the optimal volume forcing obtained in a resolvent
analysis. Thus, they cannot fully benefit from the potential for amplification
available in the flow. Finally, the sensitivity of the optimal harmonic forcing
at the cavity end is computed with an adjoint method. The sensitivities to mean
flow modification and to a localised feedback (structural sensitivity) both
identify the upstream cavity corner as the region where a small-amplitude
modification has the strongest effect. This can guide in a systematic way the
design of strategies for the control of amplification and saturation
mechanisms.

a deep matching model, can judge whether two sentences are paraphrases of each

fine-tuned by reinforcement learning in which the reward is given by the
evaluator. For the learning of the evaluator, we propose two methods based on
supervised learning and inverse reinforcement learning respectively, depending
on the type of available training data. Empirical study shows that the learned
evaluator can guide the generator to produce more accurate paraphrases.
Experimental results demonstrate the proposed models (the generators)

$Z_G(\lambda)$ of a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ when the activity
$\lambda$ is a complex number.
  This problem is already well understood when $\lambda$ is real using
connections to the $\Delta$-regular tree $T$. The key concept in that case is
the ""occupation ratio"" of the tree $T$. This ratio is the contribution to
$Z_T(\lambda)$ from independent sets containing the root of the tree, divided
by $Z_T(\lambda)$ itself. If $\lambda$ is such that the occupation ratio
converges to a limit, as the height of $T$ grows, then there is an FPTAS for
approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$.
Otherwise, the approximation problem is NP-hard.
  Unsurprisingly, the case where $\lambda$ is complex is more challenging.
Peters and Regts identified the complex values of $\lambda$ for which the
occupation ratio of the $\Delta$-regular tree converges. These values carve a
cardioid-shaped region $\Lambda_\Delta$ in the complex plane. Motivated by the
picture in the real case, they asked whether $\Lambda_\Delta$ marks the true
approximability threshold for general complex values $\lambda$.
  Our main result shows that for every $\lambda$ outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$,
the problem of approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on graphs $G$ with maximum degree
at most $\Delta$ is indeed NP-hard. In fact, when $\lambda$ is outside of
$\Lambda_\Delta$ and is not a positive real number, we give the stronger result
that approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ is actually #P-hard. If $\lambda$ is a
negative real number outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, we show that it is #P-hard to
even decide whether $Z_G(\lambda)>0$, resolving in the affirmative a conjecture
of Harvey, Srivastava and Vondrak.
  Our proof techniques are based around tools from complex analysis -
specifically the study of iterative multivariate rational maps.

optimization problem on graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. In a graph
where each edge is assigned a cost and a delay, the goal is to find a min-cost
path which does not exceed a delay bound. In this paper, we present improved
approximation schemes for RSP on several graph classes. For planar graphs,
undirected graphs with positive integer resource (= delay) values, and graphs
with $m \in \Omega(n \log n)$, we obtain $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximations in
time $O(mn/\varepsilon)$. For general graphs and directed acyclic graphs, we
match the results by Xue et al. (2008, [10]) and Ergun et al. (2002, [1]),
respectively, but with arguably simpler algorithms.

for the probability of the atom to decay spontaneously from the first excited

the cavity size radius and vice versa. For sufficiently small cavities the atom
practically does not suffers spontaneous decay, whereas for large cavities the
spontaneous decay approaches the free-space $R\to\infty$ value. On the other

mediated by several mechanisms, including linear wave damping, magnetic
reconnection, formation and dissipation of thin current sheets, stochastic
heating. It is now understood that the presence of localized coherent
structures enhances the dissipation channels and the kinetic features of the
plasma. However, no formal way of quantifying the relationship between
scale-to-scale energy transfer and the presence of spatial structures has so
far been presented. In this letter we quantify such relationship analyzing the
results of a two-dimensional high-resolution Hall-MHD simulation. In
particular, we employ the technique of space-filtering to derive a spectral
energy flux term which defines, in any point of the computational domain, the
signed flux of spectral energy across a given wavenumber. The characterization
of coherent structures is performed by means of a traditional two-dimensional
wavelet transformation. By studying the correlation between the spectral energy
flux and the wavelet amplitude, we demonstrate the strong relationship between
scale-to-scale transfer and coherent structures. Furthermore, by conditioning
one quantity with respect to the other, we are able for the first time to
quantify the inhomogeneity of the turbulence cascade induced by topological
structures in the magnetic field. Taking into account the low filling-factor of
coherent structures (i.e. they cover a small portion of space), it emerges that
80% of the spectral energy transfer (both in the direct and inverse cascade
directions) is localized in about 50% of space, and 50% of the energy transfer
is localized in only 25% of space.

data and detecting malicious domains. The key idea of inference techniques is
to first define associations between domains based on features extracted from
DNS data. Then, an inference algorithm is deployed to infer potential malicious
domains based on their direct/indirect associations with known malicious ones.
The way associations are defined is key to the effectiveness of an inference
technique. It is desirable to be both accurate (i.e., avoid falsely associating
domains with no meaningful connections) and with good coverage (i.e., identify
all associations between domains with meaningful connections). Due to the
limited scope of information provided by DNS data, it becomes a challenge to
design an association scheme that achieves both high accuracy and good
coverage.
  In this paper, we propose a new association scheme to identify domains
controlled by the same entity. Our key idea is an in-depth analysis of active
DNS data to accurately separate public IPs from dedicated ones, which enables
us to build high-quality associations between domains. Our scheme identifies
many meaningful connections between domains that are discarded by existing
state-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental results show that the proposed
association scheme not only significantly improves the domain coverage compared
to existing approaches but also achieves better detection accuracy.
  Existing path-based inference algorithm is specifically designed for DNS data
analysis. It is effective but computationally expensive. As a solution, we
investigate the effectiveness of combining our association scheme with the
generic belief propagation algorithm. Through comprehensive experiments, we
show that this approach offers significant efficiency and scalability
improvement with only minor negative impact of detection accuracy.

great surge of interest with the introduction of variational auto-encoders and

where one aims at generating samples corresponding to a number of objects under
various views. We assume that the distribution of the data is driven by two
independent latent factors: the content, which represents the intrinsic

particular observation of that object. Therefore, we propose a generative model

petroleum crucial to the formation of highly-stable water- in-crude oil
emulsions. The latter occur during crude oil production as well as spills and
cause difficulties to efficient remediation practice. It is thought that in
nanoaggregate form, asphaltenes create elastic layers around water droplets
enhancing stability of the emulsion matrix. Ultrasonic characterisation is a
high-resolution non-invasive tool in colloidal analysis shown to successfully
identify asphaltene nanoaggregation in toluene. The high sensitivity of
acoustic velocity to molecular rearrangements and ease in implementation
renders it an attractive method to study asphaltene phase properties.
Currently, aggregation is thought to correspond to an intersection of two
concentration-ultrasonic velocity regressions. Our measurements indicate a
variation in the proximity of nanoaggregation which is not accounted for by
present models. We attribute this uncertainty to physico-chemical heterogeneity
of the asphaltene fraction driven by variation in molecular size and propose a
critical nanoaggregation region. We treated asphaltenes from North and South
American crude oils with ruthenium ion catalysed oxidation to characterise
their n-alkyl appendages attached to aromatic cores. Principal component
analysis was performed to investigate the coupling between asphaltene
structures and velocity measurements and their impact on aggregation.

check different options to be able to decide on their path into the data, which

our experiments show that the search functionality is essential to solve
exploratory search tasks that require finding documents related to a narrow

using a system without search functionality find creative ways to mimic

prescribes that at threshold, except for special circumstances, a quantum
particle scattering from any potential, even if attractive at long range, will
be reflected with unit probability. In the past, this property has been
associated with the so-called badlands region of the potential, where the
semiclassical description of the scattering fails due to a rapid spatial
variation of the deBroglie wavelength. This badlands region occurs far from the
strong interaction region of the potential and has therefore been used to
""explain"" the quantum reflection phenomenon. In this paper, we show that the
badlands region of the interaction potential is immaterial. The extremely long
wavelength of the scattered particle at threshold is much longer than the
spatial extension of the badlands region which therefore does not affect the
scattering. For this purpose, we review the general proof for the existence of
quantum threshold reflection to stress that it is only a consequence of
continuity and boundary conditions. The nonlocal character of the scattering
implies that the whole interaction potential is involved in the phenomenon. We
then provide a detailed numerical study of the threshold scattering of a
particle by a Morse potential especially in the time domain. We compare exact
quantum computations with incoherent results obtained from a classical Wigner
approximation. This study shows that close to threshold the time dependent
amplitude of the scattered particle is negligible in the badlands region and
that the mean flight time of the particle is not shortened due to a local
reflection from the badlands region. This study should serve to definitely rule
out the badlands region as a qualitative guide to the properties of quantum
threshold reflection.

density over four orders of magnitude and the turbulent velocity over a factor
ten. In a companion paper, we investigate the dependence of this distribution

simulations using adaptive mesh refinement, with special attention to numerical
convergence. We also adapted an existing analytical model to the case of
collapsing clouds by employing a density probability distribution function
(PDF) $\propto \rho^{-1.5}$ instead of a lognormal distribution. Simulations
and analytical model both show two support regimes, dominated by either thermal
energy or turbulence. For the first regime, we infer that $dN/d \log M \propto
M^0$, while for the second, we obtain $dN/d \log M \propto M^{-3/4}$. This is
valid up to about ten times the mass of the first Larson core, as explained in
the companion paper, leading to a peak of the mass spectrum at $\sim 0.2
M_\odot$. From this point, the mass spectrum decreases with decreasing mass.
Although the mass spectra we obtain for the most compact clouds qualitatively
resemble the observed initial mass function, the distribution exponent is
shallower than the expected Salpeter exponent of -1.35. Nonetheless, we observe
a possible transition toward a slightly steeper value that is broadly
compatible with the Salpeter exponent for masses above a few solar masses. This
change in behavior is associated with the change in density PDF, which switches
from a power-law to a lognormal distribution. Our results suggest that while
gravitationally induced fragmentation could play an important role for low
masses, it is likely the turbulently induced fragmentation that leads to the
Salpeter exponent.

conditions of these numerical experiments are varied in the companion paper. We
also develop analytical models that we confront to our numerical results. If an
isothermal eos is used, we show that the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses
with improved numerical resolution. When an adiabatic eos is employed,
numerical convergence is obtained. The peak position varies with the eos and we
find that the peak position is about ten times the mass of the first Larson
core. By analyzing the stability of non-linear density fluctuations in the
vicinity of a point mass and then summing over a reasonable density
distribution, we find that tidal forces exert a strong stabilizing effect and
likely lead to a preferential mass several times larger than that of the first
Larson core. We propose that in a sufficiently massive and cold cloud, the peak
of the IMF is determined by the thermodynamics of the high density adiabatic
gas as well as the stabilizing influence of tidal forces. The resulting
characteristic mass is about ten times the mass of the first Larson core, which
altogether leads to a few tenths of solar masses. Since these processes are not
related to the large scale physical conditions and to the environment, our

and dispersion 0.3dex. Synthesizing these results, we estimate that the average
rest-frame dispersion measure from the neutral medium of a single, intersecting
galaxy is DM$^{NM}_{DLA}=0.25$ pc/cm^3. Analysis of AlIII and CII* absorption
limits the putative warm ionized medium to contribute
DM$^{WIM}_{DLA}<20$pc/cm^3. Given the low incidence of DLAs, we find that a
population of FRBs at z=2 will incur DM(z=2)=0.01 pc/cm^3 on average, with a
99% c.l. upper bound of 0.22 pc/cm^3. Assuming that turbulence of the ISM in
external galaxies is qualitatively similar to our Galaxy, we estimate that the
angular broadening of an FRB by intersecting galaxies is negligible
($\theta<0.1$mas). The temporal broadening is also predicted to be small, $\tau
\approx 0.3$ms for a z=1 galaxy intersecting a z=2 FRB for an observing
frequency of $\nu=1$GHz. Even with $\nu=600$MHz, the fraction of sightlines
broadened beyond 25ms is only approximately 0.1%. We conclude that gas within
the ISM of intervening galaxies has a minor effect on the detection of FRBs and
their resultant DM distributions. Download the repository at

the spatial variation of $\bar{\bar{G}}(\bf{r},\bf{r}')$ over both $\bf{r}$ and

nanostructures, facilitating both analytic calculations and unified insight

We bypass all implementation and completeness issues associated with the
alternative quasinormal eigenmode methods, by defining modes with permittivity
rather than frequency as the eigenvalue. We obtain true stationary modes that
decay rather than diverge at infinity, and are trivially normalized.
Completeness is achieved both for sources located within the inclusion and the
background through use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Modes are defined by
a linear eigenvalue problem, readily implemented using any numerical method. We
demonstrate its simple implementation on COMSOL Multiphysics, using the default
inbuilt tools. Results were validated against direct scattering simulations,
including analytical Mie theory, attaining arbitrarily accurate agreement

lubrication forces to simulate the motion of individual submerged particles.
Drag, pressure and added mass forces determine the momentum transfer by
fluid-particle interactions. A stable coupling algorithm is presented and
discussed in detail. We demonstrate the validity of our approach for dilute as

broad range of solid volume fractions in good agreement with semi-empirical

viscous fluid is thoroughly tested and established. Our approach can thus be

session, and then took part in the Harvard Implicit Association Test for
association of gender with science. The participants self-reported their

a split resonance - a doublet - with a tunable frequency splitting that matches
the microwave resonance frequency of the superconducting qubit. This is in
contrast to conventional approaches where large optical resonators with
free-spectral range comparable to the qubit microwave frequency are used. In
our system, EO mixing between the optical pump coupled into the low frequency
doublet mode and a resonance microwave photon results in an up-converted
optical photon on resonance with high frequency doublet mode. Importantly, the
down-conversion process, which is the source of noise, is suppressed in our
scheme as the coupled-resonator system does not support modes at that
frequency. Our device has at least an order of magnitude smaller footprint than
the conventional devices, resulting in large overlap between optical and
microwave fields and large photon conversion rate ($g/2\pi$) in the range of
$\sim$5-15 kHz. Owing to large $g$ factor and doubly-resonant nature of our
device, microwave-to-optical frequency conversion can be achieved with optical
pump powers in the range of tens of microwatts, even with moderate values for
optical $\it{Q}$ ($\sim 10^6$) and microwave $Q$ ($ \sim10^4$). The performance
metrics of our device, with substantial improvement over the previous EO-based
approaches, promise a scalable quantum microwave-to-optical conversion and

This paper presents a method for automatic detection of coronary artery,
thoracic aorta and cardiac valve calcifications in low-dose chest CT using two
consecutive convolutional neural networks. The first network identifies and
labels potential calcifications according to their anatomical location and the
second network identifies true calcifications among the detected candidates.
This method was trained and evaluated on a set of 1744 CT scans from the
National Lung Screening Trial. To determine whether any reconstruction or only
images reconstructed with soft tissue filters can be used for calcification
detection, we evaluated the method on soft and medium/sharp filter
reconstructions separately. On soft filter reconstructions, the method achieved
F1 scores of 0.89, 0.89, 0.67, and 0.55 for coronary artery, thoracic aorta,
aortic valve and mitral valve calcifications, respectively. On sharp filter
reconstructions, the F1 scores were 0.84, 0.81, 0.64, and 0.66, respectively.
Linearly weighted kappa coefficients for risk category assignment based on per

assumes that the source of interest repeats in both time and frequency. In
practice, this assumption does not always hold. Therefore, we introduce a
shift-invariant kernel function capable of identifying similar spectral content
even under frequency shifts. This way, we can considerably increase the amount
of suitable sound material available to the robust statistics. While this leads
to an increase in separation performance, a basic formulation, however, is
computationally expensive. Therefore, we additionally present acceleration

dependent on the power per turbine, and so approaches that can increase this
power are crucial for the development of tidal energy. In this paper, we
combine a two-scale partial array model and a one-dimensional channel model to
investigate the effects of blockage, turbine arrangement, and channel dynamics
on tidal turbines. The power per turbine is obtained as the product of two
parameters: a power coefficient measuring the power acquired from the
instantaneous flow and an environment coefficient showing the response of the
channel to added drag. The results suggest that taking account of channel
dynamics will decrease the predicted power and the optimal induction factor.
The model also shows that when the number of turbines in a row is increased,
the power per turbine may monotonically increase or decrease or attain a
maximum value at a certain global blockage. These different results depend on
two characteristic parameters of the channel: $\alpha$ and $\lambda_D$.
Furthermore, we find that besides turbine density (blockage), the arrangement
of the turbines should also be considered if we want to obtain an efficient
array. Appropriate arrangements can enhance the performance of turbines in
tidal channels, although the beneficial effects will be partly offset by
reduced velocities. The turbine arrangement also has an effect on the optimal
global blockage at which the power attains its maximum value. As the rate of
increase of the power per turbine from an array spanning the whole channel
width to the optimal partial array diminishes with increasing blockage, the
optimal global blockage will also decrease.

signals are sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields in the lower
chromosphere with strengths between 5 and 125 G, approximately. On the other
hand, partial frequency redistribution (PRD) produces sizable signals in the
wings of the Q/I profile, which have always been thought to be insensitive to
the presence of magnetic fields. Interestingly, novel observations of this line
revealed a surprising behavior: fully unexpected signals in the wings of the
U/I profile and spatial variability in the wings of both Q/I and U/I. Here we
show that the magneto-optical (MO) terms of the Stokes-vector transfer equation
produce sizable signals in the wings of U/I and a clear sensitivity of the Q/I
and U/I wings to the presence of photospheric magnetic fields with strengths
similar to those that produce the Hanle effect in the line core. This radiative
transfer investigation on the joint action of scattering processes and the
Hanle and Zeeman effects should facilitate the development of more reliable
techniques for exploring the magnetism of stellar atmospheres. To this end, we
can now exploit the circular polarization produced by the Zeeman effect, the
magnetic sensitivity caused by the above-mentioned MO effects in the Q/I and
U/I wings, and the Hanle effect in the line core.

object of theoretical and experimental investigations in recent years. For
instance, it has been shown that carbon and boron nitride nanotubes can be
unzipped into nanoribbons at high velocity impacts. However, the response of
many nanostructures to high strain-rate conditions is still not completely
understood. In this work we have investigated through fully atomistic reactive
(ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the mechanical behavior of carbon
(CNS) and boron nitride nanoscrolls (BNS) colliding against solid targets at
high velocities,. CNS (BNS) nanoscrolls are graphene (boron nitride) membranes
rolled up into papyrus-like structures. Their open-ended topology leads to
unique properties not found in close-ended analogues, such as nanotubes. Our
results show that the collision products are mainly determined by impact
velocities and by two impact angles, which define the position of the scroll
(i) axis and (ii) open edge relative to the target. Our MD results showed that
for appropriate velocities and orientations large-scale deformations and
nanoscroll fracture can occur. We also observed unscrolling (scrolls going back
to quasi-planar membranes), scroll unzipping into nanoribbons, and significant
reconstruction due to breaking and/or formation of new chemical bonds. For
particular edge orientations and velocities, conversion from open to
close-ended topology is also possible, due to the fusion of nanoscroll walls.

traditional non-linear cancellation method that is based on polynomial basis

  Control and Autoresonance","30 pages, 19 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper demonstrates analytically and experimentally an acoustic
levitation motor which has the ability to levitate and rotate an object in the
air without mechanical contact. To realize such a device two core methods are
applied simultaneously; (i) resonance tracking with an Autoresonance feedback
loop, (ii) generation of controlled structural traveling waves. The purpose of
the first method is to achieve near-field acoustic levitation, which can
levitate an object of a few kilograms. In this research, this is accomplished
through high amplitude vibration of an aluminum annulus at ultrasonic
frequencies (~30kHz). For high efficiency, the annulus is designed to have a
very high Q value, and operating even slightly off resonance ceases levitation.
Compounding this is the fact that the natural frequency constantly drifts as
ambient conditions and loading change. To accommodate such a drift, and produce
stable levitation automatically, a resonance tracking feedback loop is employed
here. Simultaneously, the purpose of the second method is to achieve propulsion
forces on the levitated object by propagating and controlling traveling waves
in the aluminum annulus to create a thin layer of rotating air beneath the
levitated body. Even though a single vibration mode can produce only standing
waves, an axisymmetric structure possesses two modes per natural frequency, and
excitation of a doublet mode pair can generate effective travelling waves. The
present paper develops the theory behind the use of the Autoresonance feedback
method for achieving constant levitation and propagating travelling waves in
co- and counter rotating directions. It will be shown that all this can be
accomplished with only single sensor. The result is a stable, repeatable and a
highly controllable contactless acoustic levitation motor.

the asymptotic classification error approaches a deterministic quantity that

the star formation process obtained from recent theoretical and numerical
studies are described. Low-velocity outflows are driven by an outer region of
the circumstellar disk, while high-velocity jets are driven near an inner edge
of the disk. The disk angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic
effects in the outflow and jet driving regions where the magnetic field is well
coupled with neutral gas. On the other hand, in a high density gas region of
the disk (or intermediate region), the magnetic field dissipates and is
decoupled from neutral gas. Thus, in such a magnetically inactive region, no
outward flow appears and the disk angular momentum is not effectively
transferred by magnetic effects. Therefore, in the disk intermediate region,
the disk surface density continues to increase and gravitational instability
occurs and produce a non-axisymmetric (or spiral) structure. After spiral arms
sufficiently develop, the disk angular momentum is transferred by gravitational
torque and a large amount of the disk mass accretes onto the central protostar
from the circumstellar disk. The episodic accretion induces time-variable
high-velocity jets. The jets do not significantly contribute to a dynamical
evolution of the protostar and circumstellar disk, while the low-velocity
outflows can eject a large fraction of the infalling gas and determine the
final stellar mass.

phenomena, certain waveforms can attain propagation-invariance. A

the modification of the spatio-temporal field structure when observed in

predicted that the associated Lorentz boost can bring to a halt the axial
dynamics of a wave packet of arbitrary profile. This phenomenon is particularly
striking in the case of a self-accelerating beam -- such as an Airy beam --
whose peak normally undergoes a transverse displacement upon free-propagation.
Here we synthesize an acceleration-free Airy wave packet that travels in a

Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than
merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations
according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support. From the
perspective of individuals affected by automated decision-making, we propose
three aims for explanations: (1) to inform and help the individual understand
why a particular decision was reached, (2) to provide grounds to contest the
decision if the outcome is undesired, and (3) to understand what would need to
change in order to receive a desired result in the future, based on the current
decision-making model. We assess how each of these goals finds support in the
GDPR. We suggest data controllers should offer a particular type of
explanation, unconditional counterfactual explanations, to support these three
aims. These counterfactual explanations describe the smallest change to the
world that can be made to obtain a desirable outcome, or to arrive at the
closest possible world, without needing to explain the internal logic of the
system.

problems where the function mapping the arm to the corresponding reward
exhibits some known structural properties. Most existing structures (e.g.
linear, Lipschitz, unimodal, combinatorial, dueling, ...) are covered by our
framework. We derive an asymptotic instance-specific regret lower bound for
these problems, and develop OSSB, an algorithm whose regret matches this
fundamental limit. OSSB is not based on the classical principle of ""optimism in
the face of uncertainty"" or on Thompson sampling, and rather aims at matching
the minimal exploration rates of sub-optimal arms as characterized in the
derivation of the regret lower bound. We illustrate the efficiency of OSSB
using numerical experiments in the case of the linear bandit problem and show
that OSSB outperforms existing algorithms, including Thompson sampling.

technological systems. Nature features transport networks that are adaptive
over a vast range of parameters, thus providing an impressive level of
robustness in supply. Theoretical and experimental studies have found that
real-world transport networks exhibit both tree-like motifs and cycles. When
the network is subject to load fluctuations, the presence of cyclic motifs may
help to reduce flow fluctuations and, thus, render supply in the network more
robust. While previous studies considered network topology via optimization
principles, here, we take a dynamical systems approach and study a simple model
of a flow network with dynamically adapting weights (conductances). We assume a
spatially non-uniform distribution of rapidly fluctuating loads in the sinks
and investigate what network configurations are dynamically stable. The network
converges to a spatially non-uniform stable configuration composed of both
cyclic and tree-like structures. Cyclic structures emerge locally in a
transcritical bifurcation as the amplitude of the load fluctuations is
increased. The resulting adaptive dynamics thus partitions the network into two
distinct regions with cyclic and tree-like structures. The location of the
boundary between these two regions is determined by the amplitude of the
fluctuations. These findings may explain why natural transport networks display
cyclic structures in the micro-vascular regions near terminal nodes, but
tree-like features in the regions with larger veins.

maximizing the utility, which is the tree reward minus the prices that we pay.
  Situations such as the above two often arise in practice where we wish to
find a good solution to an optimization problem, but we start with only some
partial knowledge about the parameters of the problem. The missing information
can be found only after paying a probing price, which we call the price of

that part of the CO gas is both kinematically and spatially de-coupled from the

explain the wide CO profile as well as the low SFR. Support for this also comes
from the SED favouring an instantaneous burst of age ~0.5 Gyr. Our survey will

fields eventually become weak such that an equivalent description using the
gluonic particle degrees of freedom starts to become valid. We revisit the
spectrum of these gluonic particles by solving the classical Yang-Mills
equations semi-analytically with the solutions having the form of power series

the gluon spectrum than the chromo-magnetic fields do. Furthermore, the large
momentum modes take less time to reach the weak-field regime while smaller
momentum modes take more time. The resulting functional form of the gluon
spectrum is exponential in nature and the spectrum is close to a thermal

Avionics Software (DDDAS) approach which during flight updates a damaged
aircraft performance model, used in turn to generate plausible flight
trajectories to a safe landing site. Our damaged aircraft model is
parameterized on a baseline glide ratio for a clean aircraft configuration
assuming best gliding airspeed on straight flight. The model predicts purely
geometric criteria for flight trajectory generation, namely, glide ratio and
turn radius for different bank angles and drag configurations. Given actual
aircraft performance data, we dynamically infer the baseline glide ratio to
update the damaged aircraft model. Our new flight trajectory generation
algorithm thus can significantly improve upon prior Dubins based trajectory
generation work by considering these data-driven geometric criteria. We further
introduce a trajectory utility function to rank trajectories for safety. As a
use case, we consider the Hudson River ditching of US Airways 1549 in January
2009 using a flight simulator to evaluate our trajectories and to get sensor
data. In this case, a baseline glide ratio of 17.25:1 enabled us to generate
trajectories up to 28 seconds after the birds strike, whereas, a 19:1 baseline
glide ratio enabled us to generate trajectories up to 36 seconds after the
birds strike. DDDAS can significantly improve the accuracy of generated flight

The code we have developed provides a SUSY Les Houches Accord interface for
setting electroweak and supersymmetric input parameters. Decays of the
neutralinos and charginos and parton-shower effects can be simulated with
multi-purpose programs such as PYTHIA. The capabilities of the code are
illustrated by phenomenological results for a parameter point in the framework

scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate
our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the
name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns
to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given
program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program
representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests
that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task
in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a

itself incorporated (as a sub-program) into a somewhat larger algorithm

more efficient than classical O(sqrt(t)) methods, as exemplified by variants of

pairing arises naturally from the energy model of RNA secondary structures.
Fixing the sequence in the pairing produces the RNA energy landscape, whose

induces the energy landscape of sequences. The latter has been considered for
designing more efficient inverse folding algorithms. We present here the
Hamming distance filtered, dual partition function, together with a Boltzmann

Hamming distance and sequence length, respectively, reducing the time
complexity of samplers, reported in the literature by $O(n^2)$. We then present
two applications, the first being in the context of the evolution of natural
sequence-structure pairs of microRNAs and the second constructing neutral
paths. The former studies the inverse fold rate (IFR) of sequence-structure
pairs, filtered by Hamming distance, observing that such pairs evolve towards
higher levels of robustness, i.e.,~increasing IFR. The latter is an algorithm
that constructs neutral paths: given two sequences in a neutral network, we
employ the sampler in order to construct short paths connecting them,
consisting of sequences all contained in the neutral network.
