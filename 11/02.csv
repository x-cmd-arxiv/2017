  Reconstruction via Deep Reinforcement Learning","8 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of image-processing problems can be formulated as optimization
problems. The objective function typically contains several terms specifically
designed for different purposes. Parameters in front of these terms are used to
control the relative weights among them. It is of critical importance to tune
these parameters, as quality of the solution depends on their values. Tuning
parameter is a relatively straightforward task for a human, as one can
intelligently determine the direction of parameter adjustment based on the
solution quality. Yet manual parameter tuning is not only tedious in many
cases, but becomes impractical when a number of parameters exist in a problem.
Aiming at solving this problem, this paper proposes an approach that employs
deep reinforcement learning to train a system that can automatically adjust
parameters in a human-like manner. We demonstrate our idea in an example
problem of optimization-based iterative CT reconstruction with a pixel-wise
total-variation regularization term. We set up a parameter tuning policy
network (PTPN), which maps an CT image patch to an output that specifies the
direction and amplitude by which the parameter at the patch center is adjusted.
We train the PTPN via an end-to-end reinforcement learning procedure. We
demonstrate that under the guidance of the trained PTPN for parameter tuning at
each pixel, reconstructed CT images attain quality similar or better than in
those reconstructed with manually tuned parameters.

  Approximate Zero-Forcing Precoding","30 Pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-forcing (ZF) precoding plays an important role for massive MIMO downlink
due to its near optimal performance. However, the high computation cost of the
involved matrix inversion hinders its application. In this paper, we adopt the
first order Neumann series (NS) for a low-complexity approximation. By
introducing a relaxation parameter jointly with one selected user's
interference to others into the precondition matrix, we propose the
identity-plus-column NS (ICNS) method. By further exploiting the multi-user
diversity gain via choosing the user with the largest interference to others,
the ordered ICNS method is also proposed. Moreover, the sum-rate approximations
of the proposed ICNS method and the competitive existing identity matrix based
NS (INS) method are derived in closed-form, based on which the performance loss
of ICNS due to inversion approximation compared with ideal ZF and its
performance gain over INS are explicitly analyzed for three typical massive
MIMO scenarios. Finally, simulations verify our analytical results and also
show that the proposed two designs achieve better performance-complexity
tradeoff than ideal ZF and existing low-complexity ZF precodings for practical
large antenna number, correlated channels and not-so-small loading factor.

the noise-map can be described as the Fourier transform of the covariance

artefacts can be seen as one realisation of the pixel covariance distribution,
which can be estimated from the antenna gain statistics. Based on this
relationship, we propose a means of improving images made with calibrated
visibilities using weighting schemes. This improvement would occur after
calibration, but before imaging - it is thus ideally used between major
iterations of self-calibration loops. Applying the weighting scheme to
simulated data improves the noise level in the final image at negligible

solar flare emission. The timing and duration of the magnetic reconnection and
subsequent energy release which drives solar flares are unknown, though the
light curves are presumably related. It is therefore critical to understand the
physics which connects the two: how does the time scale of reconnection produce
an observed GOES light curve? In this work, we model the formation and
expansion of an arcade of loops with a hydrodynamic model, which we then use to
synthesize GOES light curves. We calculate the FWHM and the e-folding decay
time of the light curves and compare them to the separation of the centroids of
the two ribbons which the arcade spans, which is representative of the size
scale of the loops. We reproduce a linear relation between the two, as found
observationally in previous work. We show that this demonstrates a direct
connection between the duration of energy release and the evolution of these
light curves. We also show that the cooling processes of individual loops
comprising the flare arcade directly affect the measured time scales. From the
clear consistency between the observed and modeled linearity, we conclude that
the primary factors that control the flare time scales are the duration of
reconnection and the loop lengths.

identify 113 secure close pairs of galaxies among a parent sample of 1801
galaxies spread over a large redshift range ($0.2<z<6$) and stellar masses
($10^7-10^{11} M_\odot$), thus probing about 12 Gyr of galaxy evolution.
Stellar masses are estimated from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting
over the extensive UV-to-NIR HST photometry available in these deep Hubble
fields, adding Spitzer IRAC bands to better constrain masses for high-redshift
($z\geqslant 3$) galaxies. These stellar masses are used to isolate a sample of
54 major close pairs with a galaxy mass ratio limit of 1:6. Among this sample,
23 pairs are identified at high redshift ($z\geqslant 3$) through their
Ly$\alpha$ emission. The sample of major close pairs is divided into five
redshift intervals in order to probe the evolution of the merger fraction with
cosmic time. Our estimates are in very good agreement with previous close pair
counts with a constant increase of the merger fraction up to $z\approx 3$ where
it reaches a maximum of 20%. At higher redshift, we show that the fraction
slowly decreases down to about 10% at $z\approx6$. The sample is further
divided into two ranges of stellar masses using either a constant separation
limit of $10^{9.5} M_\odot$ or the median value of stellar mass computed in
each redshift bin. Overall, the major close pair fraction for low-mass and
massive galaxies follows the same trend.
  These new, homogeneous, and robust estimates of the major merger fraction
since $z\approx6$ are in good agreement with recent predictions of cosmological
numerical simulations.

galaxy clusters using the spherical collapse model. Assuming a fully clustered
DE component, the spherical overdense region is treated as an isolated system
which conserves the energy separately for both matter and DE inside the
spherical region. Then, by introducing a parameter $r$ to characterize the
degree of DE clustering, which is defined by the nonlinear density contrast
ratio of matter to DE at turnaround in the recollapsing process, i.e. $r\equiv
\nld_{\de,\ta}/\nld_{\m,\ta}$, we are able to uniquely determine the spherical
collapsing process and hence obtain the virialized overdensity $\Dvir$ through
a proper virialization scheme. Estimation of the virialized overdensities from
current observation on galaxy clusters suggests that $0.5 < r < 0.8$ at
$1\sigma$ level for the clustered DE with $w < -0.9$. Also, we compare our
method to the linear perturbation theory that deals with the growth of DE
perturbation at early times. While both results are consistent with each other,
our method is practically simple and it shows that the collapse process is
rather independent of initial DE perturbation and its evolution at early times.

nuclei in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions involving ${}^{7,9}$Be,
${}^{12}$C, and ${}^{16}$O. The clustering leads to specific spatial
correlations of the nucleon distributions in the ground state, which are
manifest in the earliest stage of the ultra-high energy reaction. The formed
initial state of the fireball is sensitive to these correlations, and the
effect influences, after the collective evolution of the system, the hadron
production in the final stage. Specifically, we study effects on the harmonic
flow in collisions of light clustered nuclei with a heavy target
(${}^{208}$Pb), showing that measures of the elliptic flow are sensitive to
clusterization in ${}^{7,9}$Be, whereas triangular flow is sensitive to
clusterization in ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{16}$O. Specific predictions are made for
model collisions at the CERN SPS energies. In another exploratory development
we also examine the proton-beryllium collisions, where the $3/2^-$ ground state
of ${}^{7,9}$Be nucleus is polarized by an external magnetic field.
Clusterization leads to multiplicity distributions of participant nucleons
which depend on the orientation of the polarization with respect to the
collision axis, as well as on the magnetic number of the state. The obtained
effects on multiplicities reach a factor of a few for collisions with a large

results are established that characterize the quality of the dimension

is employed. We consider a number of standard applications of this technique as
well as a few new ones. Among the standard applications we first consider the
problem of computing the partial SVD for which a combination of sampling and
coarsening yields significantly improved SVD results relative to sampling
alone. We also consider the Column subset selection problem, a popular low rank

evaluating deep learning models for skin lesion analysis. We explore 10 choices
faced by researchers: use of transfer learning, model architecture, train
dataset, image resolution, type of data augmentation, input normalization, use
of segmentation, duration of training, additional use of SVMs, and test data
augmentation. Methods: We perform two full factorial experiments, for five
different test datasets, resulting in 2560 exhaustive trials in our main
experiment, and 1280 trials in our assessment of transfer learning. We analyze
both with multi-way ANOVA. We use the exhaustive trials to simulate sequential
decisions and ensembles, with and without the use of privileged information
from the test set. Results -- main experiment: Amount of train data has
disproportionate influence, explaining almost half the variation in
performance. Of the other factors, test data augmentation and input resolution
are the most influential. Deeper models, when combined, with extra data, also
help. -- transfer experiment: Transfer learning is critical, its absence brings
huge performance penalties. -- simulations: Ensembles of models are the best
option to provide reliable results with limited resources, without using
privileged information and sacrificing methodological rigor. Conclusions and
Significance: Advancing research on automated skin lesion analysis requires
curating larger public datasets. Indirect use of privileged information from
the test set to design the models is a subtle, but frequent methodological
mistake that leads to overoptimistic results. Ensembles of models are a
cost-effective alternative to the expensive full-factorial and to the unstable
sequential designs.

the S-shaped utility introduced by Kahneman and Tversky. We argue that risk
measures such as value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are
ineffective in constraining such players. We show that, in many standard market
models, product design aimed at utility maximization is not constrained at all
by VaR or ES bounds: the maximized utility corresponding to the optimal payoff
is the same with or without ES constraints. By contrast we show that, in
reasonable markets, risk management constraints based on a second more
conventional concave utility function can reduce the maximum S-shaped utility
that can be achieved by the investor, even if the constraining utility function
is only rather modestly concave. It follows that product designs leading to
unbounded S-shaped utilities will lead to unbounded negative expected
constraining utilities when measured with such conventional utility functions.
To prove these latter results we solve a general problem of optimizing an
investor expected utility under risk management constraints where both investor
and risk manager have conventional concave utility functions, but the investor
has limited liability. We illustrate our results throughout with the example of
the Black--Scholes option market. These results are particularly important
given the historical role of VaR and that ES was endorsed by the Basel
committee in 2012--2013.

resolved. Here we report on an extensive experimental and theoretical study,
including scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), dynamical
low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis, and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, to elucidate the structure of this interface. We consider
six different structure models, three of which have been proposed before, and
conclude that only two of them can account for the majority of experimental

al., Phys. Rev. B 44, 13144 (1991)] with a total Sn coverage of 14/12

coverage of 13/12 ML, introduced in this work. These two models are very
difficult to discriminate on the basis of DFT or LEED alone, but STS data
clearly point toward the T\""ornevik model as the most viable candidate among

regarding the electron-injection-driven phase transformation as well as the
critical role of valence band holes in this process. Similar processes may

  using Bistability and Shape Memory Polymers","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous deployment and shape reconfiguration of structures is a crucial
field of research in space exploration with emerging applications in the
automotive, building and biomedical industries. Challenges in achieving
autonomy include: bulky energy sources, imprecise deployment, jamming of
components and lack of structural integrity. Leveraging advances in the fields
of shape memory polymers, bistability and 3D multi-material printing, we
present a 3D printed programmable actuator that enables the autonomous
deployment and shape reconfiguration of structures activated though surrounding
temperature change. Using a shape memory polymer as the temperature
controllable energy source and a bistable mechanism as the linear actuator and
force amplifier, the structures achieve precise geometric activation and
quantifiable load bearing capacity. The proposed unit actuator integrates these
two components and is designed to be assembled into larger deployable and shape
reconfigurable structures. First, we demonstrate that the activation of the
unit actuator can be sequenced by tailoring each shape memory polymer to a
different activation time. Next, by changing the configuration of the actuator,
we demonstrate an initially flat surface that transforms into a pyramid or a
hyperbolic paraboloid, thus demonstrating a multi-state structure. Load bearing
capability is demonstrated for both during activation and in the operating
state.

new methods that combine the strengths of multiple existing approaches,
accomplishing a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to the previous

disequilibrium chemical processes -- e.g. vertical mixing and photochemistry.
The derived N abundance, in turn, could also place important constraints on
planetary formation mechanisms. Here, we examine the detectability of nitrogen

(1.1-1.7$\mu$m), we find that observations in K-band at $\sim$2.2$\mu$m,

strong HCN features. In anticipation of such observations, we predict
absorption feature amplitudes due to nitrogen chemistry in the 1-5$\mu$m
spectral range possible for a typical hot Jupiter. Finally, we conduct
atmospheric retrievals of 9 hot Jupiter transmission spectra in search of
near-infrared absorption features suggestive of nitrogen chemistry. We report
weak detections of NH$_3$ in WASP-31b (2.2$\sigma$), HCN in WASP-63b

employed as an upper limit of the neutrino background from electromagnetically

far-IR photometry with state-of-the-art spectral energy distribution (SED)
techniques, we derive stellar masses, star formation rates, dust properties,
and AGN contributions in galaxies over the whole COSMOS field. We find that
obscured AGNs lie within or slightly above the star-forming sequence. We
confirm our previous finding about compact host galaxies of obscured AGNs at
z~1, and find that galaxies with 20-50% AGN contributions tend to have smaller
sizes, by ~25-50%, compared to galaxies without AGNs. Furthermore, we find that
a high merger fraction of up to 0.5 is appropriate for the most luminous (log
(LIR/Lsun) ~ 12.5) AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies, but not for the whole
obscured AGN sample. Moreover, merger fraction depends on the total and
star-forming infrared luminosity, rather than the decomposed AGN infrared
luminosity. Our results suggest that major mergers are not the main driver of
AGN activity, and therefore obscured AGNs might be triggered by internal
mechanisms, such as secular processes, disk instabilities, and compaction in a
particular evolutionary stage. We make the SED modeling results publicly
available.

converge to a pore or opening, and is an important concept in nanofluidic

and pore radius. These conditions are not valid in all-atom molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of transport, due to the computational cost of large
simulation cells, and can even break down in micro- and nano-scale systems due
to strong confinement. Here, we examine a scaling theory for the access
resistance that predicts a special simulation cell aspect ratio -- the golden
aspect ratio -- where finite size effects are eliminated. Using both continuum
and all-atom simulations, we demonstrate that this golden aspect ratio exists
and that it takes on a universal value in linear response and moderate
concentrations. Outside of linear response, it gains an apparent dependence on
characteristics of the transport scenario (concentration, voltages, etc.) for
small simulation cells, but this dependence vanishes at larger length scales.
These results will enable the use of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to
study contextual properties of access resistance -- its dependence on protein

groups -- and yield the opportunity to quantitatively compare computed and

correlated enhancements of merger-induced star formation and AGN triggering may
be hidden by the variable conditions and timescales during which they occur. In
Paper I, we presented evidence of merger-triggered AGN in a sample of six
late-stage galaxy mergers (2-8 kpc nuclear separations). In this follow-up
work, we use multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope imaging and additional
archival data to examine their star-forming properties to test for
merger-triggered star formation, and if it is correlated with SMBH growth. We
find that the morphological asymmetries are correlated with enhanced specific
star formation rates, indicating the presence of merger-triggered star
formation. Additionally, the stellar populations become younger with increasing
radius from the nucleus, indicating that the merger-induced star formation
primarily occurs on global scales. However, we also find that the star
formation rate enhancements are consistent with or lower than those of larger
separation galaxy pair samples. This result is consistent with simulations
predicting a decline of the global star formation rates in late-stage galaxy
mergers with <10 kpc nuclear separations. Finally, we find that enhancements in
specific star formation rate and AGN luminosity are positively correlated, but
that an average temporal delay of >10^8 yrs likely exists between the peak of
global star formation and the onset of AGN triggering in 80% of the systems.

This characterises halos in terms of the ratio of halo masses measured at two

of the sparsity using halo catalogs from a numerical N-body simulation of

parameter constraints using measurements of the sparsity of galaxy clusters. We
show this point by performing a likelihood analysis of synthetic datasets with
no systematics, from which we recover the input fiducial cosmology. We also
perform a preliminary analysis of potential systematic errors and provide an
estimate of the impact of baryonic effects on sparsity measurements. We
evaluate the sparsity for a sample of 104 clusters with hydrostatic masses from
X-ray observations and derive constraints on the cosmic matter density
$\Omega_m$ and the normalisation amplitude of density fluctuations at the $8$
Mpc h$^{-1}$ scale, $\sigma_8$. Assuming no systematics, we find
$\Omega_m=0.42\pm 0.17$ and $\sigma_8=0.80\pm 0.31$ at $1\sigma$, corresponding
to $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m}=0.48\pm 0.11$. Future cluster surveys may
provide opportunities for precise measurements of the sparsity. A sample of a

or recording conditions. Upon providing an intrinsic link between the
properties of the outer vector product and extracted features in tensor
decompositions (TDs), the proposed common and individual information extraction
from multi-block data is performed through imposing physical meaning to
otherwise unconstrained factorisation approaches. This is shown to dramatically
reduce the dimensionality of search spaces for subsequent classification
procedures and to yield greatly enhanced accuracy. Simulations on a multi-class
classification task of large-scale extraction of individual features from a
collection of partially related real-world images demonstrate the advantages of
the ""blessing of dimensionality"" associated with TDs.

We discuss how one can (try to) determine the set of rational points on such a

water vapor absorption at Apache Point Observatory (APO). We analyze
$\sim$400,000 high-resolution, near-infrared ($H$-band) spectra of hot stars
collected as calibration data for the APO Galactic Evolution Explorer (APOGEE)
survey. We fit for the optical depths of telluric water vapor absorption
features in APOGEE spectra and convert these optical depths to Precipitable
Water Vapor (PWV) using contemporaneous data from a GPS-based PWV monitoring
station at APO. Based on simultaneous measurements obtained over a 3$^{\circ}$
field of view, we estimate that our PWV measurement precision is $\pm0.11$ mm.
We explore the statistics of PWV variations over a range of timescales from
less than an hour to days. We find that the amplitude of PWV variations within
an hour is less than 1 mm for most (96.5%) APOGEE field visits. By considering
APOGEE observations that are close in time but separated by large distances on
the sky, we find that PWV is homogeneous across the sky at a given epoch, with
90% of measurements taken up to 70$^{\circ}$ apart within 1.5 hr having
$\Delta\,\rm{PWV}<1.0$ mm. Our results can be used to help simulate the impact
of water vapor absorption on upcoming surveys at continental observing sites
like APO, and also to help plan for simultaneous water vapor metrology that may
be carried out in support of upcoming photometric and spectroscopic surveys.

handling of discourse phenomena: 50% accuracy on our coreference test set and
53.5% for coherence/cohesion (compared to a non-contextual baseline of 50%). A
simple strategy of decoding the concatenation of the previous and current

understood in terms of the porous, two-component nature and consequent

measured by a torsional rheometer reflects only the tensile contribution of the

isotropic viscoelastic materials undergoing affine shear deformation,
biopolymer networks are often anisotropic and deform nonaffinely. Here, we
numerically study the normal stresses that arise under shear in subisostatic,

on great relevance in handling security issues for critical infrastructures as
Internet Service Providers. Basically, a SIEM has two main functions: i) the
collection and the aggregation of log data and security information from
disparate network devices (routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, ad
hoc probes and others) and ii) the analysis of the gathered data by
implementing a set of correlation rules aimed at detecting potential suspicious
events as the presence of encrypted real-time traffic. In the present work, the
authors propose an enhanced implementation of a SIEM where a particular focus
is given to the detection of encrypted Skype traffic by using an ad-hoc
developed enhanced probe (ESkyPRO) conveniently governed by the SIEM itself.
Such enhanced probe, able to interact with an agent counterpart deployed into
the SIEM platform, is designed by exploiting some machine learning concepts.
The main purpose of the proposed ad-hoc SIEM is to correlate the information
received by ESkyPRO and other types of data obtained by an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) probe in order to make the encrypted Skype traffic detection as
accurate as possible.

successful in modeling a number of perceptual experiences [Carandini&Heeger12].
However, the conventional literature is usually too focused on only describing
the input->output transform.
  Instead, here we present the maths of such cascades beyond the forward
transform, namely the Jacobians and the inverse. The fundamental reason for
this analytical treatment is that it offers useful insight into the
psychophysics, the physiology, and the function of the visual system. For
instance, we show how the trends of the sensitivity (discrimination regions)
and the adaptation of the receptive fields can be seen in the expression of the
Jacobian wrt the stimulus. This matrix also tells us which regions of the
stimulus space are encoded more efficiently in multi-information terms. The
Jacobian wrt the parameters shows which aspects of the model have bigger impact
in the response, and hence bigger relevance. The analytic inverse implies
conditions for the response and the model to ensure decoding. From an applied
perspective, (a) the Jacobian wrt the stimulus is necessary in new experimental
methods based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometry, (b)
the Jacobian matrices wrt the parameters are convenient to learn the model from
classical experiments or alternative optimization goals, and (c) the inverse is
a model-based alternative to blind machine-learning neural decoding that does
not include meaningful biological information.
  The theory is checked by building a derivable and invertible vision model
that actually follows the modular program suggested by Carandini&Heeger. To
stress the generality of this modular setting we show examples where some of
the canonical Divisive Normalization layers are substituted by equivalent
layers such as the Wilson-Cowan model at V1, or a tone-mapping model at the
retina.

forces is compensated by the inward motion of the accreting matter. However,
the vertical structure of real accretion discs leads to meridional circulation
with comparable amplitudes of poloidal velocities. Using thin-disc
approximation, we consider different regimes of disc accretion with different
vertical viscosity scalings. We show that, while gas-pressure-dominated discs
can easily have a midplane outflow, standard thin radiation-pressure-dominated
disc is normally moving inwards at all the heights. However, quasi-spherical
scaling for pressure ($p\propto \varpi^{-5/2}$) leads to a midplane outflow for
a very broad range of parameters. It particular, this may lead to a reversed,
outward heat advection in geometrically thick discs when the temperature
decreases rapidly enough with height. While the overall direction of heat
advection depends on the unknown details of vertical structure and viscosity
mechanisms, existence of the midplane counterflow in quasi-spherical flows is a
robust result weakly dependent on the parameters and the assumptions of the
model. Future models of thick radiatively inefficient flows should take
meridional circulation into account.

a new formulation for the multi-school homogeneous fleet routing problem that
maximizes trip compatibility while minimizing total travel time. This
incorporates the trip compatibility for the scheduling problem in the routing
problem. Since the problem is inherently just a routing problem, finding a good
solution is not cumbersome. To compare the performance of the model with
traditional routing problems, we generate eight mid-size data sets. Through
importing the generated trips of the routing problems into the bus scheduling

spotlight has been shed on solving the combined problem of the school bus

novel decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the integrated model. The
merit of this integrated model and the decomposition method is that with the
consideration of the trip compatibility, the interrelationship between the

decomposition. Results show the proposed decomposed problem could provide the

traditional inorganic and organic semiconductors. While materials such as
CH3NH3PbI3 are non-magnetic, the presence of heavy elements (Pb and I) in a
non-centrosymmetric crystal environment result in a significant spin-splitting
of the frontier electronic bands through the Rashba-Dresselhaus effect. We
show, from a combination of \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics,
density-functional theory, and relativistic quasi-particle \textit{GW} theory,
that the nature (magnitude and orientation) of the band splitting depends on
the local asymmetry around the Pb and I sites in the perovskite structure. The
potential fluctuations vary in time as a result of thermal disorder and a
dynamic lone pair instability of the Pb(II) 6s$^{2}$6p$^{0}$ ion. We show that
the same physics emerges both for the organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 and the
inorganic CsPbI3 compound. The results are relevant to the photophysics of
these compounds and are expected to be general to other lead iodide containing
perovskites.

molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are suggested by single-molecule studies of
protein-DNA interactions. We consider univalent salt concentrations spanning
roughly a thousandfold range, together with various concentrations of excess
ligands in solution. To reveal the ionic effects on unbinding kinetics of
spontaneous and facilitated dissociation mechanisms, we treat electrostatic
interactions both at a Debye-H\""{u}ckel (DH, or `implicit' ions, i.e., use of
an electrostatic potential with a prescribed decay length) level, as well as by
the more precise approach of considering all ionic species explicitly in the
simulations. We find that the DH approach systematically overestimates
unbinding rates, relative to the calculations where all ion pairs are present
explicitly in solution, although many aspects of the two types of calculation
are qualitatively similar. For facilitated dissociation (FD, acceleration of
unbinding by free ligands in solution) explicit ion simulations lead to
unbinding at lower free ligand concentrations. Our simulations predict a
variety of FD regimes as a function of free ligand and ion concentrations; a
particularly interesting regime is at intermediate concentrations of ligands
where non-electrostatic binding strength controls FD. We conclude that
explicit-ion electrostatic modeling is an essential component to quantitatively
tackle problems in molecular ligand dissociation, including
nucleic-acid-binding proteins.

double-edged: following people who produce high-quality content increases one's

speech separation. Recent deep learning systems have made significant progress
toward solving this problem, yet it remains challenging particularly in
real-time, short latency applications. Most methods attempt to construct a mask
for each source in time-frequency representation of the mixture signal which is
not necessarily an optimal representation for speech separation. In addition,
time-frequency decomposition results in inherent problems such as
phase/magnitude decoupling and long time window which is required to achieve
sufficient frequency resolution. We propose Time-domain Audio Separation
Network (TasNet) to overcome these limitations. We directly model the signal in
the time-domain using an encoder-decoder framework and perform the source
separation on nonnegative encoder outputs. This method removes the frequency
decomposition step and reduces the separation problem to estimation of source
masks on encoder outputs which is then synthesized by the decoder. Our system
outperforms the current state-of-the-art causal and noncausal speech separation
algorithms, reduces the computational cost of speech separation, and
significantly reduces the minimum required latency of the output. This makes
TasNet suitable for applications where low-power, real-time implementation is
desirable such as in hearable and telecommunication devices.

test the method is presently limited to mass ratio $q\leq3$, initially

used for the summation while still ensuring a summed SNR of $\sim$80% of the
maximal achievable SNR (i.e. for ideally synchronized signals).

of a gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ extension of the ""scotogenic"" model. In
the $U(1)_{L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ symmetric limit, two of the the RH neutrinos
are degenerate in mass, while the third is heavier. The $U(1)_{L_{\mu} -
L_{\tau}}$ symmetry is broken spontaneously. Firstly, this breaks the
$\mu-\tau$ symmetry in the light neutrino sector. Secondly, this results in
mild splitting of the two degenerate RH neutrinos, with their mass difference
given in terms of the $U(1)_{L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ breaking parameter. Finally,
we get a massive $Z_{\mu\tau}$ gauge boson. Due to the added $Z_2$ symmetry
under which the RH neutrinos and the inert doublet are odd, the canonical
Type-I seesaw is forbidden and the tiny neutrino masses are generated
radiatively at one loop. The same $Z_2$ symmetry also ensures that the lightest
RH neutrino is stable and the other two can only decay into the lightest one.
This makes the two nearly-degenerate lighter neutrinos a two-component dark
matter, which in our model are produced by the freeze-in mechanism via the
decay of the $Z_{\mu\tau}$ gauge boson in the early universe. We show that the
next-to-lightest RH neutrino has a very long lifetime and decays into the
lightest one at the present epoch explaining the observed 3.5 keV line.

vortices in the XY- model for tangent vector order on curved backgrounds.
Contrary to naive expectations, we show that the underlying geometry does not
affect the proliferation of vortices with temperature respect to what is
observed on a flat surface. Long-range order in these systems is analyzed by
using the classical two-point correlation functions. As expected, in the case
of slightly curved substrates these correlations behave similarly to the plane.
However, for high curvatures, the presence of geometry-induced unbounded
vortices at low temperatures produces the rapid decay of correlations and an
apparent lack of long-range order. Our results shed light on the
finite-temperature physics of soft-matter systems and anisotropic magnets
deposited on curved substrates.

discriminative power than those from 2DPCA, resulting in higher accuracy for
the RS-2DLDA method over RS-2DPCA. Various distance metrics are evaluated, and
a weighting scheme is developed to further boost accuracy. A series of

elusive in the lab. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum simulation of the

recognition tasks. However, the label noise among the datasets severely
degenerates the \mbox{performance of deep} learning approaches. Recently, one
mainstream is to introduce the latent label to handle label noise, which has
shown promising improvement in the network designs. Nevertheless, the mismatch
between latent labels and noisy labels still affects the predictions in such
methods. To address this issue, we propose a quality embedding model, which
explicitly introduces a quality variable to represent the trustworthiness of
noisy labels. Our key idea is to identify the mismatch between the latent and
noisy labels by embedding the quality variables into different subspaces, which
effectively minimizes the noise effect. At the same time, the high-quality
labels is still able to be applied for training. To instantiate the model, we
further propose a Contrastive-Additive Noise network (CAN), which consists of
two important layers: (1) the contrastive layer estimates the quality variable
in the embedding space to reduce noise effect; and (2) the additive layer
aggregates the prior predictions and noisy labels as the posterior to train the
classifier. Moreover, to tackle the optimization difficulty, we deduce an SGD
algorithm with the reparameterization tricks, which makes our method scalable
to big data. We conduct the experimental evaluation of the proposed method over
a range of noisy image datasets. Comprehensive results have demonstrated CAN
outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

strategy to decouple this system into triangular form, where the diagonal
blocks consist of spin-$s$ scalar Regge-Wheeler equations, with $s=0$ or $1$.
This strategy is then implemented to give an explicit transformation of the
radial mode equations (with nonzero frequency and angular momentum) into this
triangular form. Our decoupling goes a step further than previous results in
the literature by making the triangular form explicit and reducing it as much
as possible. Also, with the help of our abstractly formulated decoupling
strategy, we have significantly streamlined both the presentation of the final
results and the intermediate calculations. Finally, we note that the vector
wave equation is a simple model for more complicated equations, like harmonic

low-dimensional materials. Here, we identify graphite as a three-dimensional
material that supports phonon hydrodynamics at significantly higher

solving the Boltzmann equation for phonon transport in graphite ribbons, we
predict that phonon Poiseuille flow and Knudsen minimum can be experimentally
observed above liquid nitrogen temperature. Further, we reveal the microscopic
origin of these intriguing phenomena in terms of the dependence of the
effective boundary scattering rate on momentum-conserving phonon-phonon
scattering processes and the collective motion of phonons. The significant
hydrodynamic nature of phonon transport in graphite is attributed to its strong
intralayer sp2 hybrid bonding and weak van der Waals interlayer interactions.
As a boundary-sensitive transport regime, phonon hydrodynamics opens up new
possibilities for thermal management and energy conversion.

algorithms due to their low visibility. Although many image enhancement
techniques have been proposed to solve this problem, existing methods
inevitably introduce contrast under- and over-enhancement. Inspired by human
visual system, we design a multi-exposure fusion framework for low-light image
enhancement. Based on the framework, we propose a dual-exposure fusion
algorithm to provide an accurate contrast and lightness enhancement.
Specifically, we first design the weight matrix for image fusion using
illumination estimation techniques. Then we introduce our camera response model
to synthesize multi-exposure images. Next, we find the best exposure ratio so
that the synthetic image is well-exposed in the regions where the original
image is under-exposed. Finally, the enhanced result is obtained by fusing the
input image and the synthetic image according to the weight matrix. Experiments
show that our method can obtain results with less contrast and lightness
distortion compared to that of several state-of-the-art methods.

quasi-one-dimensional lattices with coexisting wide and narrow bands
originating from multiple sites within a unit cell, where each site corresponds
to a single orbital. The systems studied are the 2-leg and 3-leg ladders, the
diamond chain, and the criss-cross ladder. These one-dimensional lattices are
weakly coupled to form two-dimensional (quasi-one-dimensional) ones, and the
fluctuation exchange approximation is adopted to study
spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. When one of the bands is perfectly
flat, and the Fermi level, intersecting the wide band, is placed in the
vicinity of the flat band, superconductivity arising from the interband
scattering processes is found to be strongly enhanced owing to the combination
of the light electron mass of the wide band and the strong pairing interaction
due to the large density of states of the flat band. Even when the narrow band
has finite band width, the pairing mechanism still works since the edge of the
narrow band, due to its large density of states, plays the role of the flat
band. The results indicate the generality of the high $T_c$ pairing mechanism
due to coexisting wide and ""incipient"" narrow bands in quasi-one-dimensional

the uplink power control and mmWave interference are taken into account. Using
the tools from stochastic geometry, the performance metrics of
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio coverage probability, user-perceived

densification of different SCells on the network performance is also analyzed

neglected when the mmWave SCells are extremely dense and that different kinds

brings about a puzzle for the core-accretion scenario. Since observed
super-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas
efficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to
be rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we
propose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat
transport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is
investigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate
pseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the
radiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling
luminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given
lifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for
the turbulent diffusivity, $\nu_{\rm critical}$. If $\nu_{\rm turb}>\nu_{\rm
critical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet
would become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant. We find that even a small
value of turbulent diffusion has influential effects on evolutions of
super-Earths. $\nu_{\rm critical}$ increases with the core mass. We further
ascertain that, within the minimum mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN), $\nu_{\rm
critical}$ increases with the semi-major axis. This may explain the feature
that super-Earths are common in inner PPD regions, while gas giants are common
in the outer PPD regions. The predicted envelope mass fraction (EMF) is not
fully consistent with observations. We discuss physical processes, such as late
core assembly and mass loss mechanisms, that may be operating during

regions are rich in H$_2$ because the H$_2$ formation rate depends on the dust
abundance; and (ii) whether or not CO really traces H$_2$ is uncertain,
especially at low metallicity. To clarify these issues, we use a hydrodynamic
simulation of an isolated disc galaxy with a spatial resolution of a few tens
parsecs. The evolution of dust abundance and grain size distribution is treated
consistently with the metal enrichment and the physical state of the
interstellar medium. We compute the H$_2$ and CO abundances using a subgrid
post-processing model based on the dust abundance and the dissociating
radiation field calculated in the simulation. We find that when the metallicity
is $\lesssim 0.4$ Z$_\odot$ ($t<1$ Gyr), H$_2$ is not a good tracer of star
formation rate because H$_2$-rich regions are limited to dense compact regions.
At $Z\gtrsim 0.8$ Z$_\odot$, a tight star formation law is established for both
H$_2$ and CO. At old ($t \sim 10$ Gyr) ages, we also find that adopting the
so-called MRN grain size distribution with an appropriate dust-to-metal ratio
over the entire disc gives reasonable estimates for the H$_2$ and CO

of field emission related phenomena. In small simulation domains, the
electrostatic effect from the boundaries is known to influence the calculated
apex field enhancement factor (FEF) of the emitter, but no established
dependence has been reported at present. In this work, we report the dependence
of the lateral size, $L$, and the height, $H$, of the simulation domain on the
apex-FEF of a single conducting ellipsoidal emitter. Firstly, we analyze the
error, $\varepsilon$, in the calculation of the apex-FEF as a function of $H$
and $L$. Importantly, our results show that the effects of $H$ and $L$ on
$\varepsilon$ are scale invariant, allowing one to predict $\varepsilon$ for
ratios $L/h$ and $H/h$, where $h$ is the height of the emitter. Next, we
analyze the fractional change of the apex-FEF, $\delta$, from a single emitter,
$\gamma_1$, and a pair, $\gamma_2$. We show that small relative errors in
$\gamma_1$ (i.e., $\varepsilon\approx0.5\%$), due to the finite domain size,
are sufficient to alter the functional dependence $\delta(c)$, where $c$ is the
distance from the emitters in the pair. We show that $\delta(c)$ obeys a
recently proposed power law decay in the limit of infinite domain size
($\varepsilon=0$, say), in contrast to a long time established exponential
decay. Thus, power law functional dependence, $-\delta \sim c^{-n}$, with
$n=3$, is suggested to be a universal signature of the charge-blunting effect,
at sufficient large distances between similar emitters with any shape. These
results explain the origin of the discrepancies in the literature and improves
the scientific understanding of the field electron emission theory, for
accurate characterization of emitters in small clusters or arrays.

difference-of-areas law for the area law falloff recently claimed for $N=2$ is
excluded for $N \geq 3$, provided that the string tension obeys the Casimir
scaling for the higher representations. In the case where the two loops are
distinct, we argue that the area law follows a novel law $(N - 3)A_1/(N-1)+A_2$

states proved in Grillakis and Machedon, Comm. PDEs, (2017) for
$0<\beta<\frac{2}{3}$ to a global-in-time norm approximation for $0<\beta<1$.
Our work can also be viewed as a generalization of the results of Boccato,
Cenatiempo, and Schlein, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, (2017) to a more general set of
initial data that includes coherent states along with an improved error
estimate. The key ingredients in establishing the norm approximation are the
work of Grillakis and Machedon on the local wellposedness theory, Grillakis and
Machedon, Comm. PDEs, (2019), some recent established global estimates in
Chong, Grillakis, Machedon, and Zhao, arXiv:2008.01753 (2020), and our

extend the classical momentum actuator disc theory to include the free surface
effects and allow the vertical arrangement of turbines. Most existing
literatures concern one dimensional arrays with single turbine in the vertical
direction, while the arrays in this work are two dimensional (with turbines in
both the vertical and lateral directions) and also partially block the channel
which width is far larger than height. The vertical mixing of array scale flow
is assumed to take place much faster than lateral one. This assumption has been
verified by numerical simulations. Fixing the total turbine area and utilized
width, the comparison between two-dimensional and traditional one-dimensional
arrays is investigated. The results suggest that the two dimensional
arrangements of smaller turbines are preferred to one dimensional arrays from
both the power coefficient and efficiency perspectives. When channel dynamics
are considered, the power increase would be partly offset according to the
parameters of the channel but the optimal arrangement is unchangeable.
Furthermore, we consider how to arrange finite number of turbines in a channel.
It is shown that an optimal distribution of turbines in two directions is
found. Finally, the scenario of arranging turbines in infinite flow, which is
the limiting condition of small blockages, is analysed. A new maximum power
coefficient 0.869 occurs when $Fr=0.2$, greatly increasing the peak power
compared with existing results.

alone exists as a ""massive"" black hole in the region or not. The IRS13E complex
is a very intriguing IR object which contains a large dark mass comparable to
the mass of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) from the proper motions of
the main member stars. However, the existence of the IMBH remains
controversial. There are some objections to accepting the existence of the
IMBH. In this study, we detected ionized gas with a very large velocity width
(Delta v_{FWZI} ~ 650 km/s) and a very compact size (~400 AU) in the complex
using ALMA. We also found an extended component connecting with the compact
ionized gas. The properties suggest that this would be an ionized gas flow on
the Keplerian orbit with high eccentricity. The enclosed mass is estimated to
be 10^4 Msun by the analysis of the orbit. The mass does not conflict with the
upper limit mass of the IMBH around Sgr A* which is derived by the long-term
astrometry with VLBA. In addition, the object probably has an X-ray
counterpart. Consequently, a very fascinated possibility is that the detected
ionized gas is rotating around an IMBH embedded in the IRS13E complex.

approximation of self-adjoint operator $A$ by a sequence of operators $A_n$
with absolutely continuous spectrum on a given interval $[a,b\,]$ which
converges to $A$ in a strong sense on a dense set. The notion of equi-absolute

continuity of the operator $A$ spectrum on the finite interval $[a,b\,]$ and
the condition for that the corresponding spectral density belongs to the class
$L_p[a,b\,]$ ($p\ge 1$). The application of this method to Jacobi matrices is
considered. As a one of the results we obtain the following assertion: Under
some mild assumptions (see details in Theorem (2.4)), suppose that there exist
a constant $C>0$ and a positive function $g(x)\in L_p[a,b\,]$ ($p\ge1$) such

(in the sense of Akhiezer) and $b_n$ is a second diagonal sequence of Jacobi
matrix. Then the spectrum of Jacobi matrix operator is purely absolutely
continuous on $[a,b\,]$ and for the corresponding spectral density $f(x)$ we
have $f(x)\in L_p[a,b\,]$.

interesting properties such as 1) a quasi-circular shape and enclosing the
central active region; 2) the size as large as 500\arcsec\, by 650\arcsec\,, 3)
successive brightenings in the clockwise direction at a speed of \kms{160}
starting from the nearest position to the flaring sunspots, 4) radial
contraction and expansion in the northern and the southern part, respectively
at speeds of $\leq$ \kms{10}. Using multi-wavelength data from \textit{SDO},
\textit{RHESSI}, XRT, and Nobeyama, along with magnetic field extrapolations,
we found that: 1) the secondary ribbon location is consistent with the field
line footpoints of a fan-shaped magnetic structure that connects the flaring
region and the ambient decaying field; 2) the second M2.6 flare occurred when
the expanding coronal loops driven by the first M2.0 flare encountered the
background decayed field. 3) Immediately after the second flare, the secondary
ribbon developed along with dimming regions. Based on our findings, we suggest
that interaction between the expanding sigmoid field and the overlying
fan-shaped field triggered the secondary reconnection that resulted in the
field opening and formation of the quasi-circular secondary ribbon. We thus
conclude that interaction between the active region and the ambient large-scale
fields should be taken into account to fully understand the entire eruption

the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements between the target and

classification based on a multi-level feature learning framework and Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) classifier using heart rate and wrist actigraphy derived
from a wearable device. The feature learning framework is designed to extract
low- and mid-level features. Low-level features capture temporal and frequency
domain properties and mid-level features learn compositions and structural
information of signals. Since sleep staging is a sequential problem with
long-term dependencies, we take advantage of RNNs with Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) architectures for sequence data learning. To simulate
the actual situation of daily sleep, experiments are conducted with a resting
group in which sleep is recorded in resting state, and a comprehensive group in
which both resting sleep and non-resting sleep are included.We evaluate the
algorithm based on an eight-fold cross validation to classify five sleep stages
(W, N1, N2, N3, and REM). The proposed algorithm achieves weighted precision,
recall and F1 score of 58.0%, 60.3%, and 58.2% in the resting group and 58.5%,
61.1%, and 58.5% in the comprehensive group, respectively. Various comparison
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of feature learning and BLSTM. We
further explore the influence of depth and width of RNNs on performance. Our
method is specially proposed for wearable devices and is expected to be
applicable for long-term sleep monitoring at home. Without using too much prior
domain knowledge, our method has the potential to generalize sleep disorder
detection.

properties in the bulk and on the surface of crystalline materials, is
currently under intense investigations for both fundamental interest and its
technological promises. While band crossing of non-trivial topological nature
was first studied in three dimensions for electrons, the underlying physical
idea is not restricted to fermionic excitations. In fact, experiments have
confirmed the possibility to have topological band crossing of electromagnetic
waves in artificial structures. Fundamental bosonic excitations in real
crystals, however, have not been observed to exhibit the counterpart under
ambient pressure and magnetic field, where the difficulty is in part because
natural materials cannot be precisely engineered like artificial structures.
Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to reveal the presence of topological
spin excitations (magnons) in a three-dimensional antiferromagnet, Cu3TeO6,
which features a unique lattice of magnetic spin-1/2 Cu2+ ions. Beyond previous
understanding, we find that the material's spin lattice possesses a variety of
exchange interactions, with the interaction between the ninth-nearest
neighbours being as strong as that between the nearest neighbours. Although
theoretical analysis indicates that the presence of topological magnon band
crossing is independent of model details, Cu3TeO6 turns out to be highly
favourable for the experimental observation, as its optical magnons are
spectrally sharp and intense due to the highly interconnected spin network and
the large magnetic cell. The observed magnon band crossing generally has the
form of a special type of Z2-topological nodal lines that are yet to be found
in fermion systems, rendering magnon systems a fertile ground for exploring
novel band topology.

a similar manner in both classical and quantum physics. Leggett-Garg
inequalities are inspired by the two assumptions referred to as the macroscopic

incompatible with restrictions of the Leggett-Garg type. It turned out that

fluctuations. We develop this issue with the use of entropic functions of the
Tsallis type. Varying the entropic parameter, we are often able to reach more
robust detection of violations of the corresponding Leggett-Garg inequalities.
In reality, all measurement devices suffer from losses. Within the entropic

weak elastic interactions, the phase diagram is characterized by tricritical
points, at which antiferromagnetic (AF) -like and ferromagnetic (F) -like
spinodal lines and a critical line merge. On the other hand, for relatively
strong elastic interactions, unusual ""horn structures,"" which are surrounded by
the F-like spinodal lines, disorder (D) spinodal lines, and the critical line,
are realized at higher temperatures. These structures are similar to those
obtained in our previous study [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 93}, 064109 (2016)] of an
Ising antiferromagnet with infinite-range ferromagnetic interactions, and we
find universal features caused by the interplay between the competing

origin is irrelevant (inessential) for the critical line. In contrast, the
AF-like, F-like, and D spinodal lines result from the long-range interaction of
elastic origin. This difference causes qualitatively different features of
domain formation or nucleation of the new phase: clustering occurs in the
former case, while clustering is absent in the latter. Based on the phase
diagrams, we discuss the patterns and clustering features of two-step SC

likely scenario for the formation of UCAMMs occurs via physicochemical
mechanisms taking place in a cold nitrogen rich environment, like the surface
of icy parent bodies in the outer solar system. The composition of UCAMMs

only a small number of labeled examples, especially when the label (class)
distribution is imbalanced. Emotion classification is such an example of
imbalanced label distribution, because some classes of emotions like
\emph{disgusted} are relatively rare comparing to other labels like {\it happy
or sad}. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method using generative
adversarial networks (GAN). It can complement and complete the data manifold
and find better margins between neighboring classes. Specifically, we design a
framework with a CNN model as the classifier and a cycle-consistent adversarial
networks (CycleGAN) as the generator. In order to avoid gradient vanishing
problem, we employ the least-squared loss as adversarial loss. We also propose
several evaluation methods on three benchmark datasets to validate GAN's
performance. Empirical results show that we can obtain 5%~10% increase in the
classification accuracy after employing the GAN-based data augmentation
techniques.

redder W1-W2 colours. We introduce a procedure to pull out the red outlier
population based on a combination of three stellar population diagnostics. When
compared with optically-selected AGN, red outliers are more likely to be found
in massive galaxies, and they tend to have lower stellar mass densities,
younger stellar ages and higher dust content than optically-selected AGN hosts.
They are twice as likely to be detected at radio wavelengths. We examine W1-W2
colour profiles for a subset of the nearest, reddest outliers and find that
most are not centrally peaked, indicating that the hot dust emission is spread
throughout the galaxy. We find that radio luminosity is the quantity that is
most predictive of a redder central W1-W2 colour. Radio-loud galaxies with
centrally concentrated hot dust emission are almost always morphologically
disturbed, with compact, unresolved emission at 1.4 Ghz. Eighty percent of such

superconducting upper critical fields as a function of the magnetic field angle
at a pressure as high as 98.5 kbar, we provide the first detailed examination
of the dimensionality of the superconducting condensate in WTe$_2$. Despite the
layered crystal structure, the upper critical field exhibits a negligible field

satisfactorily described by the anisotropic mass model from 2.2 K

anisotropy factor $\gamma\sim1.7$. The temperature dependence of the upper

understood by a conventional orbital depairing mechanism. Comparison of the
upper critical fields along the two orthogonal field directions results in the
same value of $\gamma\sim1.7$, leading to a temperature independent anisotropy
factor from near $T_c$ to $<0.01T_c$. Our findings thus identify WTe$_2$ as a

transverse and longitudinal oscillations in a quiescent prominence on 2015 June
29. A C2.4 flare took place in active region 12373, which was associated with a
pair of short ribbons and a remote ribbon. During the impulsive phase of the
flare, a coronal jet spurted out of the primary flare site and propagated in
the northwest direction at an apparent speed of $\sim$224 km s$^{-1}$. Part of
the jet stopped near the remote ribbon. The remaining part continued moving
forward before stopping to the east of prominence. Once the jet encountered the
prominence, it pushed the prominence to oscillate periodically. The transverse
oscillation of the eastern part (EP) of prominence can be divided into two
phases. In phase I, the initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping
timescale are $\sim$4.5 Mm, $\sim$20 km s$^{-1}$, $\sim$25 minutes, and
$\sim$7.5 hr, respectively. In phase II, the initial amplitude increases to
$\sim$11.3 Mm while the initial velocity halves to $\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. The
period increases by a factor of $\sim$3.5. The western part (WP) of prominence
also experienced transverse oscillation. The initial amplitude is only $\sim$2
Mm and the velocity is less than 10 km s$^{-1}$. The period ($\sim$27 minutes)
is slightly longer than that of EP in phase I. To the east of prominence, a
handful of horizontal threads experienced longitudinal oscillation. The initial
amplitude, velocity, period, and damping timescale are $\sim$52 Mm, $\sim$50 km
s$^{-1}$, $\sim$99 minutes, and 2.5 hr, respectively. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of simultaneous transverse and longitudinal prominence
oscillations triggered by a coronal jet.

quantum many-body systems. However, this approach has limitations and requires,
e.g., that the initial state is (i) mixed and (ii) close to equilibrium. In
this paper, we discuss these limitations and study the nonequilibrium dynamics
for a certain class of properly prepared initial states. Specifically, we
consider thermal states of the quantum system in the presence of an additional
static force which, however, become nonequilibrium states when this static
force is eventually removed. While for weak forces the relaxation dynamics is
well captured by LRT, much less is known in the case of strong forces, i.e.,
initial states far away from equilibrium. Summarizing our main results, we
unveil that, for high temperatures, the nonequilibrium dynamics of so-called
binary operators is always generated by an equilibrium correlation function. In
particular, this statement holds true for states in the far-from-equilibrium
limit, i.e., outside the linear response regime. In addition, we confirm our
analytical results by numerically studying the dynamics of local fermionic
occupation numbers and local energy densities in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.
Remarkably, these simulations also provide evidence that our results
qualitatively apply in a more general setting, e.g., in the anisotropic XXZ
model where the local energy is a non-binary operator, as well as for a wider
range of temperature. Furthermore, exploiting the concept of quantum
typicality, all of our findings are not restricted to mixed states, but are
valid for pure initial states as well.

triggered using an external velocity driver located away from, and
perpendicular to, an equilibrium Harris current sheet. Previous studies have
typically utilised an internal trigger to initiate reconnection, e.g. initial
conditions centred on the current sheet. Numerical simulations solving the
compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations were performed to
investigate the reconnection onset within different atmospheric layers of the
Sun, namely the corona, chromosphere and photosphere. A reconnecting state is
reached for all atmospheric heights considered, with the dominant physics being
highly dependent on atmospheric conditions. The coronal case achieves a sharp
rise in electric field for a range of velocity drivers. For the chromosphere,
we find a larger velocity amplitude is required to trigger reconnection. For
the photospheric environment, the electric field is highly dependent on the
inflow speed; a sharp increase in electric field is obtained only as the
velocity entering the reconnection region approaches the Alfven speed.
Additionally, the role of ambipolar diffusion is investigated for the
chromospheric case and we find that the ambipolar diffusion alters the
structure of the current density in the inflow region. The rate at which flux
enters the reconnection region is controlled by the inflow velocity. This
determines all aspects of the reconnection start-up process, i.e. the early
onset of reconnection is dominated by the advection term in Ohms law in all
atmospheric layers. A lower plasma-$\beta$ enhances reconnection and creates a
large change in the electric field. A high plasma-$\beta$ hinders the
reconnection, yielding a sharp rise in the electric field only when the
velocity flowing into the reconnection region approaches the local Alfven
speed.

manifestation of geomagnetic storms. The great low-latitude auroral displays
seen throughout East Asia on 16-18 September 1770 are considered to manifest
one of the greatest storms. Recently found 111 historical documents in East
Asia attest that these low-latitude auroral displays were succeeding for almost
9 nights during 10-19 September 1770 in the lowest magnetic latitude areas (<
30{\deg}). This suggests that the duration of the great magnetic storm is much
longer than usual. Sunspot drawings from 1770 reveals the fact that sunspots
area was twice as large as those observed in another great storm of 1859, which
substantiates this unusual storm activities in 1770. These spots likely ejected
several huge, sequential magnetic structures in short duration into
interplanetary space, resulting in spectacular world-wide aurorae in
mid-September 1770. These findings provide new insights about the history,
duration, and effects of extreme magnetic storms that may be valuable for those
who need to mitigate against extreme events.

its side band peaks, which opens a new avenue to phase locked oscillators with
large frequency differences. We observe that for low driving fields, side band

the capacity to fit the overall cosmological observations better than the
concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, therefore supporting the possibility of
dynamical dark energy (DE). Apart from the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies, the most crucial datasets involved are: i) baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO), and ii) direct large scale structure (LSS) formation data.
Analyses mainly focusing on CMB and with insufficient BAO+LSS input generally
fail to capture the dynamical DE signature, whereas the few existing studies
accounting for the wealth of known CMB+BAO+LSS data (see in particular Sol\`a,
G\'omez-Valent \& de Cruz P\'erez 2015, 2017; and Zhao et al. 2017) do converge
to the remarkable conclusion that dynamical DE might well be encoded in the
current cosmological observations at a $3-4\sigma$ c.l. A decisive factor is
the persistent $\sigma_8$-tension between the $\Lambda$CDM and the data.
Because the issue is obviously pressing, we devote this work to explain how and
why running vacuum in the expanding universe successfully relaxes the existing
$\sigma_8$-tension and describes the LSS formation data significantly better
than the $\Lambda$CDM.

denoised images with a special emphasis on images with low contrast and
noise-like texture. Denoising of such images together with noise removal often
results in image details loss or smoothing. A new test image database, FLT,
containing 75 noise-free ""reference"" images and 300 filtered (""distorted"")
images is developed. Each reference image, corrupted by an additive white
Gaussian noise, is denoised by the BM3D filter with four different values of
threshold parameter (four levels of noise suppression). After carrying out a
perceptual quality assessment of distorted images, the mean opinion scores
(MOS) are obtained and compared with the values of known full reference quality
metrics. As a result, the Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC)
between PSNR values and MOS has a value close to zero, and SROCC between values
of known full-reference image visual quality metrics and MOS does not exceed
0.82 (which is reached by a new visual quality metric proposed in this paper).
The FLT dataset is more complex than earlier datasets used for assessment of
visual quality for image denoising. Thus, it can be effectively used to design
new image visual quality metrics for image denoising.

but also transient slowdowns in reaction times, indicative of WM use. We found
that the behavior of the five monkeys was better explained in terms of a
combination of RL and WM despite inter-individual differences. The same

behavior of some monkeys while the behavior of others showed the opposite
pattern, revealing a possible different dynamics of WM process. We further

dynamics between RL and WM. This points towards either inter-species
differences or protocol differences which could be further tested in humans.

merger, implies low ambient density. We also demonstrate that the additional
low-mass ($\sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$) component with a velocity of $0.5 c$--$0.8 c$
can reproduce the early X-ray/radio counterpart. This alternative model allows
a favorably high density to detect the nonthermal emission due to the kilonova

of general linear heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE-ODE systems with

and at the uncontrolled boundary, whereby the ODE is coupled with the latter
boundary. For the state feedback design a two-step backstepping approach is
developed, that yields the conventional kernel equations and additional
decoupling equations of simple form. The latter can be traced back to simple
Volterra integral equations of the second kind, which are directly solvable
with a successive approximation. In order to implement the state feedback
controller, the design of observers for the ODE-PDE systems in question is
considered, whereby anticollocated measurements are assumed. Simple conditions
for the existence of the resulting observer-based compensator are formulated,
that can be evaluated in terms of the plant transfer behaviour. The resulting
systematic compensator design is illustrated for a 4x4 heterodirectional
hyperbolic system coupled with a third order ODE modelling a dynamic boundary

the occupation of the dot, we apply conditional control operations by changing
the tunneling rates between the dots and its reservoirs, which can be
interpreted as the action of a Maxwell demon opening or closing a shutter. This
can generate a current at equilibrium or even against a potential bias,
producing electric power from information. While this interpretation is
well-explored in the weak-coupling limit, we can address the strong-coupling
regime with a fermionic reaction-coordinate mapping, which maps the system into
a serial triple quantum dot coupled to two leads. There, we find that a
continuous projective measurement of the central dot would lead to a complete
suppression of electronic transport due to the quantum Zeno effect. In
contrast, a microscopic model for the quantum point contact detector implements
a weak measurement, which allows for closure of the control loop without
inducing transport blockade. In the weak-coupling regime between the central
dot and its leads, the energy flows associated with the feedback loop are
negligible, and the information gained in the measurement induces a bound for
the generated electric power. In contrast, in the strong coupling limit, the
protocol may require more energy for opening and closing the shutter than
electric power produced, such that the device is no longer
information-dominated and can thus not be interpreted as a Maxwell demon.

must be recovered to prevent loss and mismatch risk, and to improve their
orbits, as they are likely to be too faint for detection in shallow surveys at
future apparitions. We aimed to recover more than half of the one-opposition
NEAs recommended for observations by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) using the
Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in soft-override mode and some fractions of
available D-nights. During about 130 hours in total between 2013 and 2016, we
targeted 368 NEAs, among which 56 potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs),
observing 437 INT Wide Field Camera (WFC) fields and recovering 280 NEAs (76%
of all targets). Engaging a core team of about ten students and amateurs, we
used the THELI, Astrometrica, and the Find_Orb software to identify all moving
objects using the blink and track-and-stack method for the faintest targets and
plotting the positional uncertainty ellipse from NEODyS. Most targets and
recovered objects had apparent magnitudes centered around V~22.8 mag, with some
becoming as faint as V~24 mag. One hundred and three objects (representing 28%
of all targets) were recovered by EURONEAR alone by Aug 2017. Orbital arcs were
prolonged typically from a few weeks to a few years; our oldest recoveries
reach 16 years. The O-C residuals for our 1,854 NEA astrometric positions show
that most measurements cluster closely around the origin. In addition to the
recovered NEAs, 22,000 positions of about 3,500 known minor planets and another
10,000 observations of about 1,500 unknown objects (mostly main-belt objects)
were promptly reported to the MPC by our team. Four new NEAs were discovered
serendipitously in the analyzed fields, increasing the counting to nine NEAs
discovered by the EURONEAR in 2014 and 2015.

planar maps which belong to the $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG)
universality class for $\gamma \in (0,2)$. The family of random planar maps we
consider are those which can be encoded by a two-dimensional random walk with
i.i.d.\ increments via a mating-of-trees bijection, and includes the uniform
infinite planar triangulation (UIPT; $\gamma=\sqrt{8/3}$); and planar maps
weighted by the number of different spanning trees ($\gamma=\sqrt 2$), bipolar
orientations ($\gamma=\sqrt{4/3}$), or Schnyder woods ($\gamma=1$) that can be
put on the map.
  Using our technique, we prove estimates for graph distances in the above
family of random planar maps. In particular, we obtain non-trivial upper and
lower bounds for the cardinality of a graph distance ball consistent with the
Watabiki (1993) prediction for the Hausdorff dimension of $\gamma$-LQG and we
establish the existence of an exponent for certain distances in the map.
  The basic idea of our approach is to compare a given random planar map $M$ to
a mated-CRT map---a random planar map constructed from a correlated
two-dimensional Brownian motion---using a strong coupling (Zaitsev, 1998) of
the encoding walk for $M$ and the Brownian motion used to construct the
mated-CRT map. This allows us to deduce estimates for graph distances in $M$
from the estimates for graph distances in the mated-CRT map which we proved
(using continuum theory) in a previous work. In the special case when
$\gamma=\sqrt{8/3}$, we instead deduce estimates for the $\sqrt{8/3}$-mated-CRT
map from known results for the UIPT.
  The arguments of this paper do not directly use SLE/LQG, and can be read
without any knowledge of these objects.

interactions are, in principle, knowledge-based potentials inspired by the
ESCORE function, a base-centered scoring function. However, a special treatment
is given to base-pairing interactions and certain geometrical conformations
which are lost in a raw knowledge-base model. This results in a representation
able to describe planar canonical and non-canonical base pairs and
base-phosphate interactions and to distinguish sugar puckers and glycosidic
torsion conformations. The model is applied to the folding of several
structures, including duplexes with internal loops of non-canonical base pairs,
tetraloops, junctions and a pseudoknot. For the majority of these systems,
experimental structures are correctly predicted at the level of individual
contacts. We also propose a method for efficiently reintroducing atomistic
detail from the coarse-grained representation.

azimuthal average of the radial density profiles in both galaxies reveals a
larger spatial extent for the total GCs population with respect to the galaxy
surface brightness profile. As for the specific frequency of GCs, Sn, we find
it is a factor of two higher in N1399 than for N3115. By inspecting the radial
behavior of the specific frequency, Sn(<r), for the total, blue, and red GCs,
we find notable similarities between the trends for red GCs in the two targets.
In spite of extremely different host environments, the red GCs in both cases
appear closely linked to the light distribution of field stars. Blue GCs extend
to larger galactocentric scales than red GCs, marking a significant difference
between the two galaxies: the blue/red GCs and field stellar components of

infinity, both in the algebro-geometric and in the DG categorical frameworks.
For a smooth algebraic variety $X$ over a field of characteristic zero, one can
take its smooth compactification $\bar{X}\supset X,$ and then take the DG
category of perfect complexes on the formal punctured neighborhood of the
infinity locus $\bar{X}-X.$ The result turns out to be independent of $\bar{X}$
(up to a quasi-equivalence) and we denote this DG category by
$\operatorname{Perf}(\hat{X}_{\infty}).$
  We show that this construction can be done purely DG categorically (hence of
course also $A_{\infty}$-categorically). For any smooth DG category
$\mathcal{B},$ we construct the DG category
$\operatorname{Perf}_{top}(\hat{\mathcal{B}}_{\infty}),$ which we call the
category of perfect complexes on the formal punctured neighborhood of infinity
of $\mathcal{B}.$
  The construction is closely related to the algebraic version of a Calkin
algebra: endomorphisms of an infinite-dimensional vector space modulo
endomorphisms of finite rank. We prove that the DG categorical construction is
compatible with the algebro-geometric one.
  We study numerous examples. In particular, for the algebra of rational
functions on a smooth complete connected curve $C$ we obtain the algebra of
adeles $\mathbb{A}_C,$ and for $\mathcal{B}=D^b_{coh}(Y)$ for a proper singular
scheme $Y$ we obtain the category $D_{sg}(Y)^{op}$ -- the opposite category of

previous studies on co-design of incentive mechanism and privacy preservation
assume a trustworthy fusion center (FC). Very recent work has taken steps to
relax the assumption on trustworthy FC and allows participatory users (PUs) to
add well calibrated noise to their raw sensing data before reporting them,
whereas the focus is on the equilibrium behavior of data subjects with binary
data. Making a paradigm shift, this paper aim to quantify the privacy
compensation for continuous data sensing while allowing FC to directly control
PUs. There are two conflicting objectives in such scenario: FC desires better
quality data in order to achieve higher aggregation accuracy whereas PUs prefer
adding larger noise for higher privacy-preserving levels (PPLs). To achieve a
good balance therein, we design an efficient incentive mechanism to REconcile
FC's Aggregation accuracy and individual PU's data Privacy (REAP).
Specifically, we adopt the celebrated notion of differential privacy to measure
PUs' PPLs and quantify their impacts on FC's aggregation accuracy. Then,
appealing to Contract Theory, we design an incentive mechanism to maximize FC's
aggregation accuracy under a given budget. The proposed incentive mechanism
offers different contracts to PUs with different privacy preferences, by which
FC can directly control PUs. It can further overcome the information asymmetry,
i.e., the FC typically does not know each PU's precise privacy preference. We
derive closed-form solutions for the optimal contracts in both complete
information and incomplete information scenarios. Further, the results are
generalized to the continuous case where PUs' privacy preferences take values
in a continuous domain. Extensive simulations are provided to validate the
feasibility and advantages of our proposed incentive mechanism.

polynomial. The entropy and the total influence are two ways to measure the
concentration of its Fourier coefficients, namely the monomial coefficients in
this representation: the entropy roughly measures their spread, while the total
influence measures their average level. The Fourier Entropy/Influence
conjecture of Friedgut and Kalai from 1996 states that the entropy to influence
ratio is bounded by a universal constant $C$.
  Using lexicographic Boolean functions, we present three explicit asymptotic
constructions that improve upon the previously best known lower bound
$C>6.278944$ by O'Donnell and Tan, obtained via recursive composition. The
first uses their construction with the lexicographic function $\ell\left\langle
2/3\right\rangle $ of measure $2/3$ to demonstrate that
$C\ge4+3\log_{4}3>6.377444$. The second generalizes their construction to
biased functions and obtains $C>6.413846$ using $\ell\left\langle
\Phi\right\rangle $, where $\Phi$ is the inverse golden ratio. The third,
independent, construction gives $C>6.454784$, even for monotone functions.
  Beyond modest improvements to the value of $C$, our constructions shed some
new light on the properties sought in potential counterexamples to the
conjecture.
  Additionally, we prove a Lipschitz-type condition on the total influence and
spectral entropy, which may be of independent interest.

$d$-dimensional manifold utilizing only noisy function values at locations
sampled from the manifold with noise. To produce the approximation we do not
require any knowledge regarding the manifold other than its dimension $d$. We
use the Manifold Moving Least-Squares approach of (Sober and Levin 2016) to
reconstruct the atlas of charts and the approximation is built on-top of those
charts. The resulting approximant is shown to be a function defined over a
neighborhood of a manifold, approximating the originally sampled manifold. In
other words, given a new point, located near the manifold, the approximation
can be evaluated directly on that point. We prove that our construction yields
a smooth function, and in case of noiseless samples the approximation order is
$\mathcal{O}(h^{m+1})$, where $h$ is a local density of sample parameter (i.e.,
the fill distance) and $m$ is the degree of a local polynomial approximation,
used in our algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm has linear time
complexity with respect to the ambient-space's dimension. Thus, we are able to
avoid the computational complexity, commonly encountered in high dimensional
approximations, without having to perform non-linear dimension reduction, which
inevitably introduces distortions to the geometry of the data. Additionaly, we
show numerical experiments that the proposed approach compares favorably to
statistical approaches for regression over manifolds and show its potential.

more feasible correlation-based entanglement criterion acts as an excellent
proxy for entropic entanglement and can determine the existence of entanglement
for a mixed state at finite temperature, making itself an excellent indicator
for DPT. Our work provides a deeper understanding about the connection between
DPTs and quantum entanglement, and may allow the detection of DPT via
entanglement become accessible as the examined criterion is suitable for
measuring entanglement.

least one scientific bibliographic unit in a given time period. As proposed by

generalized blockmodeling with the assumed
multi-core--semi-periphery--periphery blockmodel type. The term core denotes a
group of researchers who published together in a systematic way with each
other.
  The obtained blockmodels are comprehensively analyzed by visualizations and
through considering several statistics regarding the global network structure.
To measure the stability of the obtained blockmodels, different adjusted
modified Rand and Wallace indices are applied. Those enable to distinguish
between the splitting and merging of cores when operationalizing the stability
of cores. Also, the adjusted modified indices can be used when new researchers
occur in the second time period (newcomers) and when some researchers are no
longer present in the second time period (departures). The research disciplines
are described and clustered according to the values of these indices.
Considering the obtained clusters, the sources of instability of the research
disciplines are studied (e.g., merging or splitting of cores, newcomers or
departures). Furthermore, the differences in the stability of the obtained
cores on the level of scientific disciplines are studied by linear regression
analysis where some personal characteristics of the researchers (e.g., age,
gender), are also considered.

this minimal nonlinear system has been previously shown to exhibit a

full phase diagram and show that besides a parameter regime exhibiting
bistability, there is also a regime of self-oscillations characterized by a
frequency comb in its spectrum. We discuss the mechanism of comb generation
which appears to be different from those studied in microcavity frequency combs
and mode-locked lasers. We then address the fate of the comb-like spectrum in
the regime of strong quantum fluctuations, reached when nonlinearity becomes
the dominant scale with respect to dissipation. We find that the nonlinearity
responsible for the emergence of the frequency combs also leads to its
dephasing, leading to broadening and ultimate disappearance of sharp spectral
peaks. Our study explores the fundamental question of the impact of quantum
fluctuations for quantum systems which do not possess a stable fixed point in
the classical limit.

magnitude lower than predicted according to star formation relations that have
been calibrated in the disc of our own and nearby galaxies. Understanding how
and why star formation appears to be different in this region is crucial if we
are to understand the environmental dependence of the star formation process.
Here, we present the detection of a sample of high-mass cores in the CMZ's
""dust ridge"" that have been discovered with the Submillimeter Array as part of
the CMZoom survey. These cores range in mass from ~ 50 - 2150 Msun within radii
of 0.1 - 0.25 pc. All appear to be young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are
prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of high-mass stars and
sub-clusters. We report that at least two of these cores ('c1' and 'e1')
contain young, high-mass protostars. We compare all of the detected cores with
high-mass cores in the Galactic disc and find that they are broadly similar in
terms of their masses and sizes, despite being subjected to external pressures
that are several orders of magnitude greater - ~ 10^8 K/cm^3, as opposed to ~
10^5 K/cm^3. The fact that > 80% of these cores do not show any signs of
star-forming activity in such a high-pressure environment leads us to conclude
that this is further evidence for an increased critical density threshold for
star formation in the CMZ due to turbulence.

modeling nucleation and growth of clusters. The main feature of the equation is
the dependence of the driving vector field and boundary condition on a
non-local order parameter related to the excess mass of the system.
  The first main result concerns the well-posedness and regularity of the
Cauchy problem. The well-posedness is based on a fixed point argument, and the
regularity on Schauder estimates. The first a priori estimates yield H\""older
regularity of the non-local order parameter, which is improved by an iteration
argument.
  The asymptotic behavior of solutions depends on some order parameter $\rho$
depending on the initial data. The system shows different behavior depending on
a value $\rho_s>0$, determined from the potentials and diffusion coefficient.
For $\rho \leq \rho_s$, there exists an equilibrium solution
$c^{\text{eq}}_{(\rho)}$. If $\rho\le\rho_s$ the solution converges strongly to
$c^{\text{eq}}_{(\rho)}$, while if $\rho > \rho_s$ the solution converges
weakly to $c^{\text{eq}}_{(\rho_s)}$. The excess $\rho - \rho_s$ gets lost due
to the formation of larger and larger clusters. In this regard, the model
behaves similarly to the classical Becker-D\""oring equation.
  The system possesses a free energy, strictly decreasing along the evolution,
which establishes the long time behavior. In the subcritical case $\rho<\rho_s$
the entropy method, based on suitable weighted logarithmic Sobolev inequalities
and interpolation estimates, is used to obtain explicit convergence rates to
the equilibrium solution.
  The close connection of the presented model and the Becker-D\""oring model is
outlined by a family of discrete Fokker-Planck type equations interpolating
between both of them. This family of models possesses a gradient flow
structure, emphasizing their commonality.

research, a method for generating a timed knee trajectory close to able-bodied
individuals, which leads to sufficient clearance between the foot and the floor
and the knee extension, was proposed using the inertial motion. Limb motions
are known to correlate with each other during walking. This phenomenon is
called kinematic synergy. In the present study, we measure gaits in level
walking of able-bodied individuals with a wide range of walking velocities. We
show that this kinematic synergy also exists between the motions of the intact
limbs and those of the knee as determined by the inertial motion technique. We
then propose a new method for generating the motion of the knee joint using its
inertial motion close to the able-bodied individuals in mid-swing based on its
kinematic synergy, such that the method can adapt to the changes in the motion
velocity. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed method
achieves prosthetic walking similar to that of able-bodied individuals with a
wide range of constant walking velocities and termination of walking from
steady-state walking. Further investigations have found that a kinematic
synergy also exists at the start of walking. Overall, our method successfully
achieves knee motion generation from the initiation of walking through
steady-state walking with different velocities until termination of walking.

$\mathbb{R}^d$ driven by Gaussian noise. This allows us to derive exact
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for the amplitude and phase of the
solution, which are accurate over times over order
$\exp\big(Cb\epsilon^{-1}\big)$, where $\epsilon$ is the amplitude of the noise
and $b$ the magnitude of decay of transverse fluctuations. Within the
variational framework, different choices of the amplitude-phase decomposition
correspond to different choices of the inner product space $\mathbb{R}^d$. For
concreteness, we take a weighted Euclidean norm, so that the minimization
scheme determines the phase by projecting the full solution on to the limit
cycle using Floquet vectors. Since there is coupling between the amplitude and
phase equations, even in the weak noise limit, there is a small but non-zero
probability of a rare event in which the stochastic trajectory makes a large
excursion away from a neighborhood of the limit cycle. We use the amplitude and
phase equations to bound the probability of it doing this: finding that the
typical time the system takes to leave a neighborhood of the oscillator scales
as $\exp\big(Cb\epsilon^{-1}\big)$.

on a combinatorial (say, triangulated) surface, we investigate the problem of
computing a homotopy between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ where the length of the
longest intermediate curve is minimized. Such optimal homotopies are relevant

homotopy theory to more practical applications such as similarity measures on

  We prove that Homotopy Height is in the complexity class NP, and the
corresponding exponential algorithm is the best one known for this problem.
This result builds on a structural theorem on monotonicity of optimal
homotopies, which is proved in a companion paper. Then we show that this

to the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, a new topological phase with
two zero-energy Majorana modes at each end of an open chain appears in the
phase diagram. We show that the derivative of EE with respect to one of the
parameters of the Hamiltonian can detect the quantum phase transitions by
exhibiting cusp like structure at those points; impurity strength ($\la_d$) can
substantially modify the peak/dip height associated with the cusp. Importantly,
we find that the logarithmic scaling of the EE with block size remains
unaffected by the application of the impurity term, although, the coefficient
(i.e., central charge) varies logarithmically with the impurity strength for a
lower range of $\la_d$ and eventually saturates with an exponential damping
factor ($\sim \exp(-\la_d)$) for the phase boundaries shared with the phase
containing two Majorana edge modes. On the other hand, it receives a linear
correction in term of $\la_d$ for an another phase boundary. Finally, we focus
to study the effect of the impurity in the time evolution of the EE for the
critical quenching case where impurity term is applied only to the final
Hamiltonian. Interestingly, it has been shown that for all the phase boundaries
in contrary to the equilibrium case, the saturation value of the EE increases
logarithmically with the strength of impurity in a certain region of $\la_d$
and finally, for higher values of $\la_d$, it increases very slowly which is
dictated by an exponential damping factor.

  There is a large number of different types of vacua in these theories with
both unbroken and spontaneously broken global flavor symmetry,
$U(N_F)\rightarrow U({\rm n}_1)\times U({\rm n}_2)$. We consider in this paper
the large subset of these vacua with the unbroken non-trivial $Z_{2N_c-N_F\geq

in the main text for all these vacua.

that spatial (network) structure is a viable mechanism for cooperation to
evolve. A recently proposed numerical metric, average gradient of selection
(AGoS), a useful tool for interpreting and visualizing evolutionary dynamics on
networks, allows simulation results to be visualized on a one-dimensional phase
space. However, stochastic mutation of strategies was not considered in the
analysis of AGoS. Here we extend AGoS so that it can analyze the evolution of
cooperation where mutation may alter strategies of individuals on networks. We
show that our extended AGoS correctly visualizes the final states of
cooperation with mutation in the individual-based simulations. Our analyses
revealed that mutation always has a negative effect on the evolution of
cooperation regardless of the payoff functions, fraction of cooperators, and
network structures. Moreover, we found that scale-free networks are the most
vulnerable to mutation and thus the dynamics of cooperation are altered from
bistability to coexistence on those networks, undergoing an imperfect pitchfork
bifurcation.

access networks has attracted attention in recent years, as this technology
offers high receiver sensitivity, inherent frequency selectivity, and linear
field detection enabling the full compensation of linear channel impairments.
However, the complexity of conventional (dual-polarisation digital) coherent
receivers has so far prevented their introduction into access networks. Thus,
to exploit the benefits of coherent technology in the ONUs, low complexity
coherent receivers, suitable for implementation in ONUs, are needed. In this
paper, the recently proposed low complexity coherent (i.e.,
polarisation-independent Alamouti-coding heterodyne) receiver is, for the first
time, compared in terms of its minimum receiver sensitivity with five
previously reported receiver designs, including a detailed discussion on their
advantages and limitations. It is shown that the Alamouti-coding based receiver
approach allows the lowest number of photons per bit (PPB) transmitted (with a
lower bound of 15.5 PPB in an ideal system simulations) whilst requiring the
lowest optical receiver hardware complexity. It also exhibits comparable
complexity to the currently deployed direct-detection receivers, which
typically require >1000 PPB. Finally, a comparison of experimentally achieved
receiver sensitivities and transmission distances using these receivers is
presented. The highest spectral efficiency and longest transmission distance at

However, a recent study found that a significant amount of configuration errors
require fixing more than one setting together. To address this limitation,
Ocasta statistically clusters dependent configuration settings based on the
application's accesses to its configuration settings and utilizes the extracted
clustering of configuration settings to fix configuration errors involving more
than one configuration settings. Ocasta treats applications as black-boxes and
only relies on the ability to observe application accesses to their

  We collected traces of real application usage from 24 Linux and 5 Windows

it on 16 real-world configuration errors of 11 Linux and Windows applications.
Ocasta is able to successfully repair all evaluated configuration errors in 11

electronic devices embedded within networks that are exposed to the threat of
cyberattacks. Cyber vulnerabilities are magnified with EVs due to unique risks
associated with EV battery packs. Current batteries have well-known issues with
specific energy, cost and fire-related safety risks. In this study, we develop
a systematic framework to assess the impact of cyberattacks on EVs. While the
current focus of automotive cyberattacks is on short-term physical safety, it
is crucial to consider long-term cyberattacks that aim to cause financial
losses through accrued impact, especially in the context of EVs. Faulty
components of battery management systems such as a compromised voltage
regulator could lead to cyberattacks that can overdischarge or overcharge the
battery. Overdischarge could lead to failures such as internal shorts in the
timescale of minutes through cyberattacks that compromise energy-intensive EV
subsystems like auxiliary components. Attacks that overcharge the pack could
shorten the lifetime of a new battery pack to less than a year. Further, such
attacks also pose physical safety risks via the triggering of thermal (fire)
events. Attacks on auxiliary components lead to battery drain, which could be
up to 20% of the state-of-charge per hour. Lastly, we develop a heuristic for
the stealthiness of a cyberattack to augment traditional threat models. The
methodology presented here will help in building the foundational principles of
electric vehicle cybersecurity: a nascent but critical topic in the coming
years.

science and related fields, the global view of materials data is highly sparse.
This sparsity encourages training models on the union of multiple datasets, but
simple unions can prove problematic as (ostensibly) equivalent properties may
be measured or computed differently depending on the data source. These hidden
contextual differences introduce irreducible errors into analyses,
fundamentally limiting their accuracy. Transfer learning, where information
from one dataset is used to inform a model on another, can be an effective tool
for bridging sparse data while preserving the contextual differences in the
underlying measurements. Here, we describe and compare three techniques for
transfer learning: multi-task, difference, and explicit latent variable
architectures. We show that difference architectures are most accurate in the
multi-fidelity case of mixed DFT and experimental band gaps, while multi-task
most improves classification performance of color with band gaps. For
activation energies of steps in NO reduction, the explicit latent variable
method is not only the most accurate, but also enjoys cancellation of errors in
functions that depend on multiple tasks. These results motivate the publication
of high quality materials datasets that encode transferable information,
independent of industrial or academic interest in the particular labels, and
encourage further development and application of transfer learning methods to
materials informatics problems.

essential for the design of large assemblies of desired properties. Here, we
introduce a computational model for cooperative self-assembly with simultaneous
attachment of structured groups of particles, which can be described by
simplexes (connected pairs, triangles, tetrahedrons and higher order cliques)
to a growing network, starting from a small seed. The model incorporates
geometric rules that provide suitable nesting spaces for the new group and the
chemical affinity $\nu$ of the system to accepting an excess number of
particles. For varying chemical affinity, we grow different classes of
assemblies by binding the cliques of distributed sizes. Furthermore, to
characterise the emergent large-scale structures, we use the metrics of graph
theory and algebraic topology of graphs, and 4-point test for the intrinsic
hyperbolicity of the networks. Our results show that higher Q-connectedness of
the appearing simplicial complexes can arise due to only geometrical factors,
i.e., for $\nu = 0$, and that it can be effectively modulated by changing the
chemical potential and the polydispersity of the size of binding simplexes. For
certain parameters in the model we obtain networks of mono-dispersed clicks,

dimension-intonation, rhythm, loudness, tone quality and pronunciation? This is
done by (i) classifying the classroom singing practices, tutor's verbal

  Fourier Projection-slice Theorem",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a multi-dimensional (M-D) sparse Fourier transform inspired by the
idea of the Fourier projection-slice theorem, called FPS-SFT. FPS-SFT extracts
samples along lines (1-dimensional slices from an M-D data cube), which are
parameterized by random slopes and offsets. The discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) along those lines represents projections of M-D DFT of the M-D data onto
those lines. The M-D sinusoids that are contained in the signal can be
reconstructed from the DFT along lines with a low sample and computational
complexity provided that the signal is sparse in the frequency domain and the
lines are appropriately designed. The performance of FPS-SFT is demonstrated
both theoretically and numerically. A sparse image reconstruction application
is illustrated, which shows the capability of the FPS-SFT in solving practical
problems.

introduced to find the best possible solution in a reasonable amount of time.
Genetic Algorithm is used with a novel fitness function as the Metaheuristic.
The aim of N-Queens Problem is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard, in a
way so that no queen is in conflict with the others. Chromosome representation
and genetic operations like Mutation and Crossover are described in detail.
Results show that this approach yields promising and satisfactory results in
less time compared to that obtained from the previous approaches for several
large values of N.
