limited budget is a well-studied problem with applications in network security,
viral marketing, social networks, and public health. In real graphs, virus may
infect a node which in turn infects its neighbor nodes and this may trigger an
epidemic in the whole graph. The goal thus is to select the best k nodes
(budget constraint) that are immunized (vaccinated, screened, filtered) so as
the remaining graph is less prone to the epidemic. It is known that the problem
is, in all practical models, computationally intractable even for moderate
sized graphs. In this paper we employ ideas from spectral graph theory to
define relevance and importance of nodes. Using novel graph theoretic
techniques, we then design an efficient approximation algorithm to immunize the
graph. Theoretical guarantees on the running time of our algorithm show that it
is more efficient than any other known solution in the literature. We test the
performance of our algorithm on several real world graphs. Experiments show
that our algorithm scales well for large graphs and outperforms state of the
art algorithms both in quality (containment of epidemic) and efficiency
(runtime and space complexity).

the issue of a patch. One way to mitigate this window of vulnerability is to
use a configuration workaround, which prevents the vulnerable code from being
executed at the cost of some lost functionality -- but only if one is
available. Since program configurations are not specifically designed to
mitigate software vulnerabilities, we find that they only cover 25.2% of
vulnerabilities.
  To minimize patch delay vulnerabilities and address the limitations of
configuration workarounds, we propose Security Workarounds for Rapid Response
(SWRRs), which are designed to neutralize security vulnerabilities in a timely,
secure, and unobtrusive manner. Similar to configuration workarounds, SWRRs
neutralize vulnerabilities by preventing vulnerable code from being executed at
the cost of some lost functionality. However, the key difference is that SWRRs
use existing error-handling code within programs, which enables them to be
mechanically inserted with minimal knowledge of the program and minimal
developer effort. This allows SWRRs to achieve high coverage while still being
fast and easy to deploy.
  We have designed and implemented Talos, a system that mechanically
instruments SWRRs into a given program, and evaluate it on five popular Linux
server programs. We run exploits against 11 real-world software vulnerabilities
and show that SWRRs neutralize the vulnerabilities in all cases. Quantitative
measurements on 320 SWRRs indicate that SWRRs instrumented by Talos can
neutralize 75.1% of all potential vulnerabilities and incur a loss of
functionality similar to configuration workarounds in 71.3% of those cases. Our
overall conclusion is that automatically generated SWRRs can safely mitigate
2.1x more vulnerabilities, while only incurring a loss of functionality
comparable to that of traditional configuration workarounds.

line of cool interstellar gas, and is the brightest of emission lines from star
forming galaxies from FIR through meter wavelengths. With the advent of ALMA
and NOEMA, capable of detecting [CII]-line emission in high-redshift galaxies,
there has been a growing interest in using the [CII] line as a probe of the
physical conditions of the gas in galaxies, and as a SFR indicator at z>4. In
this paper, we use a semi-analytical model of galaxy evolution (G.A.S.)
combined with the code CLOUDY to predict the [CII] luminosity of a large number
of galaxies at 4< z<8. At such high redshift, the CMB represents a strong
background and we discuss its effects on the luminosity of the [CII] line. We
study the LCII-SFR and LCII-Zg relations and show that they do not strongly
evolve with redshift from z=4 and to z=8. Galaxies with higher [CII]
luminosities tend to have higher metallicities and higher star formation rates
but the correlations are very broad, with a scatter of about 0.5 dex for
LCII-SFR. Our model reproduces the LCII-SFR relations observed in high-redshift
star-forming galaxies, with [CII] luminosities lower than expected from local
LCII-SFR relations. Accordingly, the local observed LCII-SFR relation does not
apply at high-z. Our model naturally produces the [CII] deficit, which appears
to be strongly correlated with the intensity of the radiation field in our
simulated galaxies. We then predict the [CII] luminosity function, and show
that it has a power law form in the range of LCII probed by the model with a
slope alpha=1. The slope is not evolving from z=4 to z=8 but the number density
of [CII]-emitters decreases by a factor of 20x. We discuss our predictions in
the context of current observational estimates on both the differential and
cumulative luminosity functions.

producing yearly estimates for subnational areas in Kenya over the period 1980

likelihood with fixed effects for the urban/rural stratification to account for
the complex survey design. We carry out smoothing using Bayesian hierarchical
models with continuous spatial and temporally discrete components. A key
component of the model is an offset to adjust for bias due to the effects of
HIV epidemics. Substantively, there has been a sharp decline in U5MR in the

remains. A priority for future research is understanding this variability.

Using ugri photometry from VST and JKs from VISTA, GC candidates were selected
using the morpho-photometric and color properties of spectroscopically
confirmed GCs available in the literature. The strength of the results was
verified against available archival HST/ACS data from the GHOSTS survey.
Results. The adopted GC selection leads to the definition of a sample of ~350
GC candidates. At visual inspection, we find that 82 objects match all the
requirements for selecting GC candidates and 155 are flagged as uncertain GC
candidate; 110 are unlikely GCs, most likely background galaxies. Furthermore,
our analysis shows that four of the previously spectroscopically confirmed GCs,
i.e., ~20% of the total spectroscopic sample, are more likely either background
galaxies or high-velocity Milky Way stars. The radial density profile of the
selected best candidates shows the typically observed r1/4-law radial profile.
The analysis of the color distributions reveals only marginal evidence of the
presence of color bimodality, which is normally observed in galaxies of similar
luminosity. The GC luminosity function does not show the typical symmetry,
mainly because of the lack of bright GCs. Part of the bright GCs missing might
be at very large galactocentric distances or along the line of sight of the
galaxy dusty disk. Conclusions. Using ugriJKs photometry we purged the list of
GCs with spectroscopic membership and photometric GC candidates in NGC 253. Our
results show that the use of either spectroscopic or photometric data only does
not generally ensure a contaminant-free sample and a combination of both
spectroscopy and photometry is preferred.

range of 80 kms-1 in velocity and 50~mas (corresponding to 60~AU for a distance

disk edges. The mass estimate is constrained to be only in the range of 10--30
solar masses. The distribution of the wind emission among the transitions is
surprisingly different, which reflects its sensitivity to excitation
conditions. The wind probably extracts significant angular momentum from the

but the theory behind this phenomenon is only starting to catch up with the
practice. Numerous works show that depth is the key to this efficiency. A
certain class of deep convolutional networks -- namely those that correspond to
the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decomposition -- has been proven to have
exponentially higher expressive power than shallow networks. I.e. a shallow
network of exponential width is required to realize the same score function as
computed by the deep architecture. In this paper, we prove the expressive power
theorem (an exponential lower bound on the width of the equivalent shallow
network) for a class of recurrent neural networks -- ones that correspond to
the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. This means that even processing an image
patch by patch with an RNN can be exponentially more efficient than a (shallow)
convolutional network with one hidden layer. Using theoretical results on the
relation between the tensor decompositions we compare expressive powers of the
HT- and TT-Networks. We also implement the recurrent TT-Networks and provide
numerical evidence of their expressivity.

proposed a mechanism called shapelet learning which parameterizes the shapelets

$S_\alpha(\rho)$ of an unknown mixed quantum state $\rho$ in $d$ dimensions,

  We provide an algorithm with copy complexity $O(d^{2/\alpha})$ for estimating

at least quadratic in $d$, which is the order dependence on the number of
copies required for learning the entire state $\rho$. For integral $\alpha>1$,
on the other hand, we provide an algorithm for estimating $S_\alpha(\rho)$ with
a sub-quadratic copy complexity of $O(d^{2-2/\alpha})$. We characterize the
copy complexity for integral $\alpha>1$ up to constant factors by providing
matching lower bounds. For other values of $\alpha$, and the von Neumann

This shows that we either need new algorithms for better upper bounds, or
better lower bounds to tighten the results.

corollary, we strengthen a lower bound on the copy complexity of the EYD
algorithm for learning the maximally mixed state by showing that the lower

others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent
reinforcement learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement
learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its
(non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies
learned using InRL can overfit to the other agents' policies during training,
failing to sufficiently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric,
joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for
general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies
generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic
analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm
generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle,
and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces
the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate
the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings:
gridworld coordination games and poker.

Applying Hamilton-Jacobi formalism we solve inflationary dynamics and find that
inflation goes on along the ${\cal W}_{-1}$ branch of the Lambert function.
Depending on the model parameter mutated hilltop model renders two types of
inflationary solutions: one corresponds to small inflaton excursion during
observable inflation and the other describes large field inflation. The
inflationary observables from curvature perturbation are in tune with the
current data for a wide range of the model parameter. The small field branch
predicts negligible amount of tensor to scalar ratio $r\sim
\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, while the large field sector is capable of generating
high amplitude for tensor perturbations, $r\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. Also,
the spectral index is almost independent of the model parameter along with a
very small negative amount of scalar running. Finally we find that the mutated
hilltop inflation closely resembles the $\alpha$-attractor class of
inflationary models in the limit of $\alpha\phi\gg 1$.

spectrograph for high precision radial velocity measurements that will operate
in the YJH-bands. While using an AO system in such instrument is generally
considered to feed a single-mode fiber, NIRPS is following a different path by
using a small multi-mode fiber (more specifically called ""few-mode fiber"").
This choice offers an excellent trade-off by allowing to design a compact
cryogenic spectrograph, while maintaining a high coupling efficiency under bad
seeing conditions and for faint stars. The main drawback resides in a much more
important modal-noise, a problem that has to be tackled for allowing 1m/s
precision radial velocity measurements. We study the impact of using an AO
system to couple light into few-mode fibers. We focus on two aspects: the
coupling efficiency into few-mode fibers and the question of modal noise and
scrambling. We show first that NIRPS can reach coupling >= 50% up to magnitude
I=12, and offer a gain of 1-2 magnitudes over a single-mode solution. We
finally show that the best strategy to mitigate modal noise with the AO system
is among the simplest: a continuous tip-tilt scanning of the fiber core.

encoded by a two-dimensional random walk with i.i.d. increments or a
two-dimensional Brownian motion via a ""mating-of-trees"" type bijection. This
class includes the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT), the
infinite-volume limits of random planar maps weighted by the number of spanning
trees, bipolar orientations, or Schnyder woods they admit, and the
$\gamma$-mated-CRT map for $\gamma \in (0,2)$. For each of these maps, we
obtain an upper bound for the Green's function on the diagonal, an upper bound
for the effective resistance to the boundary of a metric ball, an upper bound
for the return probability of the random walk to its starting point after $n$
steps, and a lower bound for the graph-distance displacement of the random
walk, all of which are sharp up to polylogarithmic factors.
  When combined with work of Lee (2017), our bound for the return probability
shows that the spectral dimension of each of these random planar maps is a.s.
equal to 2, i.e., the (quenched) probability that the simple random walk
returns to its starting point after $2n$ steps is $n^{-1+o_n(1)}$. Our results
also show that the amount of time that it takes a random walk to exit a metric
ball is at least its volume (up to a polylogarithmic factor). In the special
case of the UIPT, this implies that random walk typically travels at least
$n^{1/4 - o_n(1)}$ units of graph distance in $n$ units of time. The matching
upper bound for the displacement is proven by Gwynne and Hutchcroft (2018).
These two works together resolve a conjecture of Benjamini and Curien (2013) in
the UIPT case.
  Our proofs are based on estimates for the mated-CRT map (which come from its
relationship to SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity) and a strong coupling
of the mated-CRT map with the other random planar map models.

aggregation-dispersion transition and the resulting bottleneck for replica

REST scales more moderately than T-REMD, we expect that REST will be useful for
studying the self-assembly of larger systems in solution with enhanced

The basic idea is to consider a convex outer approximation of the set of

robust optimization procedure that minimizes the worst case loss over this
outer region (via a linear program). Crucially, we show that the dual problem
to this linear program can be represented itself as a deep network similar to

we can learn a classifier that is provably robust to any norm-bounded
adversarial attack. We illustrate the approach on a number of tasks to train
classifiers with robust adversarial guarantees (e.g. for MNIST, we produce a

current understanding of cosmology, the Milky Way (MW) has continued to accrete
smaller-sized dwarf galaxies since its formation. Remnants of this process
surround the MW as debris streams and satellite galaxies, and provide
information that is complementary to studies of the Galaxy itself. The
satellite system thus has the potential to teach us about the formation and
evolution of the MW. Can the existence of a narrow, co-rotating plane of
satellite galaxies (the Vast Polar Structure, VPOS) put constraints on our
Galaxy's properties? Are such satellite galaxy planes more narrow around less
massive hosts, more abundant around more concentrated hosts, more kinematically
coherent around more early-forming halos? To address such questions, we have
looked for correlations between properties of satellite galaxy planes fitted to
cosmological simulations in the ELVIS suite and properties of their host dark
matter halos, while accounting for realistic observational biases such as the
obscuration by the disk of the MW. We find no evidence for strong correlations
that would allow conclusions on the host halo properties from the mere
existence of the VPOS around our Galaxy.

We show 2D experiments can measure most of the 3D fluctuation power at k<0.2

foregrounds pose two challenges: (1) simple geometric effects produce
percent-level correlations between radio and infrared fluxes, even if their
luminosities are uncorrelated; and (2) radio and infrared foreground residuals
contribute sample variance noise to the cross spectrum. The first challenge
demands better foreground masking and subtraction, while the second demands
large fields of view to average away uncorrelated radio and infrared power.

stellar-mass black hole typically form a massive accretion torus around the
remnant black hole or long-lived NS. Outflows from these neutrino-cooled
accretion disks represent an important site for $r$-process nucleosynthesis and
the generation of kilonovae. We present the first three-dimensional,
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations including weak
interactions and a realistic equation of state of such accretion disks over
viscous timescales ($380\,\mathrm{ms}$). We witness the emergence of
steady-state MHD turbulence, a magnetic dynamo with an $\sim\!20\,\mathrm{ms}$
cycle, and the generation of a `hot' disk corona that launches powerful thermal
outflows aided by the energy released as free nucleons recombine into
$\alpha$-particles. We identify a self-regulation mechanism that keeps the
midplane electron fraction low ($Y_e\sim0.1$) over viscous timescales. This
neutron-rich reservoir, in turn, feeds outflows that retain a sufficiently low
value of $Y_e\approx 0.2$ to robustly synthesize third-peak $r$-process
elements. The quasi-spherical outflows are projected to unbind $40\%$ of the
initial disk mass with typical asymptotic escape velocities of $0.1c$, and may
thus represent the dominant mass ejection mechanism in NS-NS mergers. Including
neutrino absorption, our findings agree with previous hydrodynamical
$\alpha-$disk simulations that the entire range of $r$-process nuclei from the
first to the third $r$-process peak can be synthesized in the outflows, in good
agreement with observed solar system abundances. The asymptotic escape
velocities and the quantity of ejecta, when extrapolated to moderately higher

may facilitate preferential pairing between DNA molecules, with identical or
similar base pair texts, without separation of base pairs. One solely relies on
base pair specific patterns of helix distortion being the same on the two
molecules, discussed extensively in the past. The other mechanism proposes that
there are preferential interactions between base pairs of the same composition.
We introduce a model, built on this second mechanism, where both thermal
stretching and twisting fluctuations are included, as well as the base pair
specific helix distortions. Firstly, we consider an approximation for weak
pairing interactions, or short molecules. This yields a dependence of the
energy on the square root of the molecular length, which could explain recent
experimental data. However, analysis suggests that this approximation is
no-longer valid at large DNA lengths. In a second approximation, for long
molecules, we define two adaptation lengths for twisting and stretching, over
which the pairing interaction can limit the accumulation of helix disorder.
When the pairing interaction is sufficiently strong, both adaptation lengths
are finite; however, as we reduce pairing strength, the stretching adaptation
length remains finite but the torsional one becomes infinite. This second state
persists to arbitrarily weak values of the pairing strength; suggesting that,
if the molecules are long enough, the pairing energy scales as length. To probe
differences between the two pairing mechanisms, we also construct a model of
similar form. However, now, pairing between identical sequences solely relies
on the intrinsic helix distortion patterns. Between the two models, we see
interesting qualitative differences. We discuss our findings, and suggest new
work to distinguish between the two mechanisms.

for the first time in an individual AGN. We show that while a reprocessing

apparently match the observed light curves and inter-band lags, it fails to
reproduce the observed timescale dependency in the color variation. Such
discrepancy raises a severe challenge to, and can hardly be reconciled under

timescale dependency of the color variation is uniquely powerful in probing the

simulator, demonstrating their relevance to obtain unbiased temperature
estimates from non-equilibrium measurements. Our findings will help guide
research on the interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in quantum
simulation, in studying the transition from integrability to chaos and in the
design of new quantum devices.

evaluate the full evolving phase-space distribution of particles. We simulate
oscillations due to the harmonic trap, the collision of clouds without
thermalization, and observe a small elongation of the actual oscillation period

of weak anharmonicity. In the experiment, measurements are made after release
from the one-dimensional trap. We evaluate the gas density curves after such a
release, characterizing the actual time necessary for reaching the asymptotic
state where the integrable quasi-particle momentum distribution function
emerges.

atmosphere with an effective temperature of \approx 24 kK and that its surface
helium and nitrogen abundances are enhanced, respectively, by factors of
\approx 2 and 20--30. This suggests that either Sk-69 279 was initially a
(single) fast-rotating (\ga 400 km/s) star, which only recently evolved off the

the shell is composed mostly of the CNO processed material lost by the star.

biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One
motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be
captured from images, from which similarities between different drug compounds
applied at different doses can be quantified. The general approach is to find a
function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality
whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important
known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from
nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more
correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than
for those from different weeks, despite having identical drug compounds applied
in both cases. In this case, the particular batch in which a set of experiments
were conducted constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image
embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug
effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in
order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant
biological information. To achieve this, we minimize a loss function based on
distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of
embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset we
present results with, the only replicated treatment happens to be the negative
control treatment, for which we do not expect any treatment-induced cell
morphology changes. We find that for our transformed embeddings (i) the
underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also
carry improved biological signal; and (ii) less domain-specific information is
present.

solving two adversarial games that have their equilibrium concentrating at the

the union of two nonempty polytopes whose relaxation gives the convex hull of

depolarisation in limiting the amplitude of coherent polarisation rotations is
demonstrated. The polarisation rotation amplitude is thus very sensitive to the

dose while maintaining high quality of reconstructed images. To reduce the
radiation dose, one can reduce the number of projection views (sparse-view CT);
however, it becomes difficult to achieve high-quality image reconstruction as
the number of projection views decreases. Researchers have applied the concept
of learning sparse representations from (high-quality) CT image dataset to the
sparse-view CT reconstruction. We propose a new statistical CT reconstruction
model that combines penalized weighted-least squares (PWLS) and $\ell_1$ prior
with learned sparsifying transform (PWLS-ST-$\ell_1$), and a corresponding
efficient algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). To moderate the difficulty of tuning ADMM parameters, we propose a new
ADMM parameter selection scheme based on approximated condition numbers. We
interpret the proposed model by analyzing the minimum mean square error of its
($\ell_2$-norm relaxed) image update estimator. Our results with the extended
cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom data and clinical chest data show that, for
sparse-view 2D fan-beam CT and 3D axial cone-beam CT, PWLS-ST-$\ell_1$ improves
the quality of reconstructed images compared to the CT reconstruction methods
using edge-preserving regularizer and $\ell_2$ prior with learned ST. These
results also show that, for sparse-view 2D fan-beam CT, PWLS-ST-$\ell_1$
achieves comparable or better image quality and requires much shorter runtime
than PWLS-DL using a learned overcomplete dictionary. Our results with clinical
chest data show that, methods using the unsupervised learned prior generalize
better than a state-of-the-art deep ""denoising"" neural network that does not

The arguments lead to a generalization of the classical formula found by Fisher
(1930). The restricted class includes cases with discrete distributions, the
case of the shape parameter in the Gamma distribution, and also the case of the
correlation coefficient in a bivariate Gaussian model. One of the examples can
also be used in a pedagogical context to demonstrate possible difficulties with

the SFR profiles of 864 galaxies as a function of their position relative to
the global star forming main sequence (Delta SFR). For galaxies above the
global main sequence (positive Delta SFR) Delta Sigma_SFR is elevated
throughout the galaxy, but the greatest enhancement in star formation occurs at
small radii (< 3 kpc, or 0.5 R_e). Moreover, galaxies that are at least a
factor of three above the main sequence show diluted gas phase metallicities

throughout the galaxy with the lowest values of Delta Sigma_SFR in the central

the correlation of the GW data with the DFT gap is more robust than the

ICM mass, the total baryonic mass and the cold baryonic fraction with cluster
mass and redshift. We find significant departures from self-similarity in the
mass scaling for all quantities, while the redshift trends are all
statistically consistent with zero, indicating that the baryon content of
clusters at fixed mass has changed remarkably little over the past $\approx9$
Gyr. We compare our results to the mean baryon fraction (and the stellar mass

cluster virial regions in all but the most massive clusters at low redshift.
Using a simple model of the matter assembly of clusters from infalling groups
with lower masses and from infalling material from the low density environment
or field surrounding the parent halos, we show that the measured mass trends
without strong redshift trends in the stellar mass scaling relation could be
explained by a mass and redshift dependent fractional contribution from field

evidence for the so-called ""missing baryons"" outside cluster virial regions.

system is described by a Kerr black hole with quasinormal mode perturbations.
It is far from straightforward to identify the time at which the ringdown
begins. Yet determining this time is important for precision tests of the
general theory of relativity that compare an observed signal with quasinormal
mode descriptions of the ringdown, such as tests of the no-hair theorem. We
present an algorithmic method to analyze the choice of ringdown start time in
the observed waveform. This method is based on determining how close the strong
field is to a Kerr black hole (Kerrness). Using numerical relativity
simulations, we characterize the Kerrness of the strong-field region close to
the black hole using a set of local, gauge-invariant geometric and algebraic
conditions that measure local isometry to Kerr. We produce a map that
associates each time in the gravitational waveform with a value of each of
these Kerrness measures; this map is produced by following outgoing null
characteristics from the strong and near-field regions to the wave zone. We
perform this analysis on a numerical relativity simulation with parameters
consistent with GW150914- the first gravitational wave detection. We find that
the choice of ringdown start time of $3\,\mathrm{ms}$ after merger used in the
GW150914 study to test general relativity corresponds to a high dimensionless
perturbation amplitude of $ \sim 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$ in the strong-field
region. This suggests that in higher signal-to-noise detections, one would need
to start analyzing the signal at a later time for studies that depend on the
validity of black hole perturbation theory.

from pathological) tremor are an unavoidable component of human motor control.
While the origins of the physiological tremor are known to depend on muscle
afferentation, it is possible that the mechanical properties of muscle-tendon
systems also affect its generation, amplification and maintenance. In this
paper, we investigated the dependence of physiological tremor during tonic,
isometric plantarflextion torque at 30% of maximum at three ankle angles. The
amplitude of physiological tremor increased as calf muscles shortened in
contrast to the stretch reflex whose amplitude decreases as muscle shortens. We
used a closed-loop simulation model of afferented muscle to explore the
mechanisms responsible for this behavior. We demonstrate that changing muscle
lengths does not suffice to explain our experimental findings. Rather, the
model consistently required the modulation of gamme-static fusimotor drive to
produce increases in physiological tremor with muscle shortening--while
successfully replicating the concomitant reduction in stretch reflex amplitude.
This need to control gamma-static fusimotor drive explicitly as a function of
muscle length has important implication. First, it permits the amplitudes of
physiological tremor and stretch reflex to be decoupled. Second, it postulates
neuromechanical interaction that require length-dependent gamma drive
modulation to be independent from alpha drive to the parent muscle. Lastly, it
suggests that physiological tremor can be used as a simple, non-invasive
measure of the afferent mechanisms underlying healthy motor function, and their
disruption in neurological conditions.

sample of 13 high-quality quasar spectra and high resolution numerical
simulations of the IGM. Our approach is based on fitting the neutral hydrogen
column density $N_{HI}$ and the Doppler parameter $b$ of the absorption lines
in the \mlya\ forest. The first measurement is obtained using a novel Bayesian
scheme which takes into account the statistical correlations between the
parameters characterising the lower cut-off of the $b-N_{HI}$ distribution and
the power-law parameters $T_0$ and $\gamma$ describing the TDR. This approach
yields $T_0/ 10^3\, {\rm K}=15.6 \pm 4.4 $ and $\gamma=1.45 \pm 0.17$
independent of the assumed pressure smoothing of the small scale density field.
In order to explore the information contained in the overall $b-N_{HI}$
distribution rather than only the lower cut-off, we obtain a second measurement
based on a similar Bayesian analysis of the median Doppler parameter for
separate column-density ranges of the absorbers. In this case we obtain $T_0/
10^3\, {\rm K}=14.6 \pm 3.7$ and $\gamma=1.37 \pm 0.17$ in good agreement with
the first measurement. Our Bayesian analysis reveals strong anti-correlations
between the inferred $T_0$ and $\gamma$ for both methods as well as an
anti-correlation of the inferred $T_0$ and the pressure smoothing length for
the second method, suggesting that the measurement accuracy can in the latter

tools for projection-based model reduction of time-invariant dynamic systems.
For hyperbolic wavefield problems, such techniques perform well in
configurations where only a few modes contribute to the field. RKS methods,
however, are fundamentally limited by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate, making
them unsuitable for the approximation of wavefields in configuration
characterized by large travel times and propagation distances, since wavefield
responses in such configurations are highly oscillatory in the
frequency-domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose to precondition the
RKSs by factoring out the rapidly varying frequency-domain field oscillations.
The remaining amplitude functions are generally slowly varying functions of
source position and spatial coordinate and allow for a significant compression
of the approximation subspace. Our one-dimensional analysis together with
numerical experiments for large scale 2D acoustic models show superior
approximation properties of preconditioned RKS compared with the standard RKS
model-order reduction. The preconditioned RKS results in a reduction of the
frequency sampling well below the Nyquist-Shannon rate, a weak dependence of
the RKS size on the number of inputs and outputs for
multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) problems, and, most importantly, in a
significant coarsening of the finite-difference grid used to generate the RKS.
A prototype implementation indicates that the preconditioned RKS algorithm is
competitive in the modern high performance computing environment.

solution"", by which we mean a special solution $V(|x|, t)$ of $V_t-\Delta
V=f(V)$ such that, as $t\to\infty$, $V(r,t)$ converges to the corresponding one
dimensional propagating terrace of [DGM]. We show that such radial terrace
solutions exist in our setting, and the general solution $u(x,t)$ can be well
approximated by a suitablly shifted radial terrace solution $V(|x|, t)$. These
will enable us to obtain better convergence result for $u(x,t)$.
  We stress that $u(x,t)$ is a high dimensional solution without any symmetry.
Our results indicate that the one dimensional propagating terrace is a rather
fundamental concept; it provides the basic structure and ingredients for the
long-time profile of solutions in all space dimensions.

undergoing an irreversible reaction upon first encounter with a stationary

allow for a competing reaction, i.e., instantaneous trapping of the diffusing
reactant with probability $s$ at any vacant site before interacting with a
(stationary) co-reactant at a target site. We determine the mean walklength of
the diffusing reactant until irreversible reaction occurs. We use generating
functions and the theory of finite Markov processes, as well as MC simulations.
To investigate the dependence of walklength on lattice size we compute the
first, finite size corrections to the Green function of the sc lattice, and
provide a Pad\'e approximation for this quantity. Finally, we consider the case
where both reactant and co-reactant undergo synchronous nearest-neighbor
displacements [""two-walker (2W) problem""]. In this case, reactant and
co-reactant can individually be trapped with probability $s$ at any vacant
lattice site, or can undergo an irreversible reaction on first encounter at any
site. When $s=0$ we find that, both for the 1W and the 2W problem, for lattices
with (approximately) the same number of sites, the mean walklength is smaller
(and hence the reaction efficiency greater) in $d=3$ than in $d=2$. Increasing
$s$ tends to reduce differences in system dimensionality, and distinctions
between the 1W problem and the 2W problem. Our model provides a good starting
point to develop studies on the efficiency of apparently diverse

is subject to noise, and we cannot obtain the exact objective value.
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a type of general-purpose randomized
optimization algorithm, have been shown to be able to solve noisy optimization
problems well. However, previous theoretical analyses of EAs mainly focused on
noise-free optimization, which makes the theoretical understanding largely
insufficient for the noisy case. Meanwhile, the few existing theoretical
studies under noise often considered the one-bit noise model, which flips a
randomly chosen bit of a solution before evaluation; while in many realistic
applications, several bits of a solution can be changed simultaneously. In this
paper, we study a natural extension of one-bit noise, the bit-wise noise model,
which independently flips each bit of a solution with some probability. We
analyze the running time of the (1+1)-EA solving OneMax and LeadingOnes under
bit-wise noise for the first time, and derive the ranges of the noise level for
polynomial and super-polynomial running time bounds. The analysis on
LeadingOnes under bit-wise noise can be easily transferred to one-bit noise,
and improves the previously known results. Since our analysis discloses that
the (1+1)-EA can be efficient only under low noise levels, we also study
whether the sampling strategy can bring robustness to noise. We prove that
using sampling can significantly increase the largest noise level allowing a
polynomial running time, that is, sampling is robust to noise.

organizations to scale agile practices across the enterprise. Problem: Early
adopters of SAFe tend to be large multi-national enterprises who report that
the adoption of SAFe has led to significant productivity and quality gains.
However, little is known about whether these benefits translate to small to
medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Method: As part of a longitudinal study of an
SME transitioning to SAFe we ask, to what extent are SAFe practices adopted at
the team level? We targeted all team members and administrated a mixed method
survey in February, 2017 and in July, 2017 to identify and evaluate the
adoption rate of SAFe practices. Results: Initially in Quarter 1, teams were
struggling with PI/Release health and Technical health throughout the
organization as most of the teams were transitioning from plan-driven to SAFe .
But, during the transition period in Quarter 3, we observed discernible
improvements in different areas of SAFe practice adoption. Conclusion: The
observed improvement might be due to teams merely becoming more familiar with
the practices over-time. However, management had also made some structural
changes to the teams that may account for the change.

  Using Image Classification Techniques",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In spite of the high accuracy of the existing optical mark reading (OMR)
systems and devices, a few restrictions remain existent. In this work, we aim
to reduce the restrictions of multiple choice questions (MCQ) within tests. We
use an image registration technique to extract the answer boxes from answer
sheets. Unlike other systems that rely on simple image processing steps to
recognize the extracted answer boxes, we address the problem from another
perspective by training a machine learning classifier to recognize the class of
each answer box (i.e., confirmed, crossed out, or blank answer). This gives us
the ability to deal with a variety of shading and mark patterns, and
distinguish between chosen (i.e., confirmed) and canceled answers (i.e.,
crossed out). All existing machine learning techniques require a large number
of examples in order to train a model for classification, therefore we present
a dataset including six real MCQ assessments with different answer sheet
templates. We evaluate two strategies of classification: a straight-forward
approach and a two-stage classifier approach. We test two handcrafted feature
methods and a convolutional neural network. In the end, we present an
easy-to-use graphical user interface of the proposed system. Compared with
existing OMR systems, the proposed system has the least constraints and
achieves a high accuracy. We believe that the presented work will further
direct the development of OMR systems towards reducing the restrictions of the
MCQ tests.

demand for data processing applications, consume tremendous energy. Powering
DCs with renewable energy can effectively reduce the brown energy consumption.
Owing to geographically distributed deployment of DCs, the renewable energy
generation and the data processing demands usually vary in different DCs.
Migrating virtual machines (VMs) among DCs according to the availability of
renewable energy helps match the energy demands and the renewable energy
generation in DCs, and thus maximizes the utilization of renewable energy. We
first elicit the renewable energy-aware inter-datacenter (inter-DC) VM
migration problem in an inter-DC network over the elastic optical
infrastructure, present it as a many-manycast communications problem, and then
formulate it as an integer linear programming problem. The objective is to
minimize the total cost of the brown energy consumption of DCs in such inter-DC
network via VM migration. We use CVX and Gurobi to solve this problem for small
network configurations, and we propose a few heuristic algorithms that
approximate the optimal solution for large network configurations. Through
extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms, by migrating VM
among DCs, can reduce up to 19.7% cost of the brown energy consumption.

from free electrons, emitted in magnet arrays such as undulators, forms the
basis of much of modern X-ray science. This approach has the drawback of
requiring very high energy, up to the multi-GeV-scale, electron beams, to
obtain the required photon energy. Due to the limit in accelerating gradients
in conventional particle accelerators, reaching high energy typically demands
use of instruments exceeding 100's of meters in length. Compact, less costly,
monochromatic X-ray sources based on very high field acceleration and very
short period undulators, however, may revolutionize diverse advanced X-ray
applications ranging from novel X-ray therapy techniques to active
interrogation of sensitive materials, by making them accessible in cost and
size. Such compactness may be obtained by an all-optical approach, which
employs a laser-driven high gradient accelerator based on inverse free electron
laser (IFEL), followed by a collision point for inverse Compton scattering
(ICS), a scheme where a laser is used to provide undulator fields. We present
an experimental proof-of-principle of this approach, where a TW-class CO2 laser
pulse is split in two, with half used to accelerate a high quality electron
beam up to 84 MeV through the IFEL interaction, and the other half acts as an
electromagnetic undulator to generate up to 13 keV X-rays via ICS. These
results demonstrate the feasibility of this scheme, which can be joined with
other techniques such as laser recirculation to yield very compact, high
brilliance photon sources, extending from the keV to MeV scale. Furthermore,
use of the IFEL acceleration with the ICS interaction produces a train of very
high intensity X-ray pulses, thus also permitting a unique tool that can be
phase-locked to a laser pulse in frontier pump-probe experimental scenarios.

traditional in-memory methods for these tasks do not scale to the datasets that
are forbiddingly large in modern simulations. Our prior paper proposes
memory-efficient streaming algorithms that can find the largest halos in a

this approach fails when directly scaling to larger datasets. This paper
presents a robust streaming tool that leverages state-of-the-art techniques on
GPU boosting, sampling, and parallel I/O, to significantly improve performance

previous results from finding the centers of the $10^3$ largest halos to $\sim

values of 1100 kg m$^{-3}$ at the surface, to 1800 kg m$^{-3}$ at 1-m depth. On
average, the scale height of these profiles is $\sim$7 cm, corresponding to a
thermal inertia of 55 $\pm$2 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$ at 273 K, relevant
to the diurnally active near-surface layer, $\sim$4-7 cm. The
temperature-dependence of thermal conductivity and heat capacity leads to a
$\sim$2$\times$ diurnal variation in thermal inertia at the equator. On global
scales, the regolith fines are remarkably uniform, implying rapid
homogenization by impact gardening of this layer on timescales $<$ 1 Gyr.
Regional and local scale variations show prominent impact features $<$ 1 Gyr

in the interiors and ejecta of Copernican-aged impact craters, and lower
thermal inertia ($<$ 50 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) within the lunar cold

form requires determining the crystalline form with the lowest relative Gibbs
free energy. Effective computational prediction of the most stable polymorph
could save significant time and effort in the design of novel molecular
crystalline solids or predict their behavior under new conditions.
  In this study, we introduce a new approach using multistate reweighting to
address the problem of determining solid-solid phase diagrams, and apply this
approach to the phase diagram of solid benzene. For this approach, we perform
sampling at a selection of temperature and pressure states in the region of
interest. We use multistate reweighting methods to determine the reduced free
energy differences between $T$ and $P$ states within a given polymorph. The
relative stability of the polymorphs at the sampled states can be successively
interpolated from these points to create the phase diagram by combining these
reduced free energy differences with a reference Gibbs free energy difference
between polymorphs. The method also allows for straightforward estimation of
uncertainties in the phase boundary. We also find that when properly
implemented, multistate reweighting for phase diagram determination scales
better with size of system than previously estimated.

structural equation modeling, with applications to learning undirected and
directed graphical models. We extend these ideas by defining and studying an
algebraic structure called the neighborhood lattice based on a generalized
notion of neighborhood regression. We show that this algebraic structure has
the potential to provide an economic encoding of all conditional independence
statements in a Gaussian distribution (or conditional uncorrelatedness in
general), even in the cases where no graphical model exists that could
""perfectly"" encode all such statements. We study the computational complexity
of computing these structures and show that under a sparsity assumption, they
can be computed in polynomial time, even in the absence of the assumption of
perfectness to a graph. On the other hand, assuming perfectness, we show how
these neighborhood lattices may be ""graphically"" computed using the separation
properties of the so-called partial correlation graph. We also draw connections
with directed acyclic graphical models and Bayesian networks. We derive these
results using an abstract generalization of partial uncorrelatedness, called
partial orthogonality, which allows us to use algebraic properties of
projection operators on Hilbert spaces to significantly simplify and extend
existing ideas and arguments. Consequently, our results apply to a wide range
of random objects and data structures, such as random vectors, data matrices,

of revealing the properties of dark matter particles. For the detection of muon
neutrinos, the main issue is the large atmospheric background, which is caused
by the interactions between the cosmic rays and atoms within the atmosphere.
Compared with muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos have a smaller atmospheric
background especially for the downward-going direction. Except for the
classical neutrino sources, dark matter particles can also annihilate into the
neutrinos and are the potential high energy astrophysical sources. The
annihilation rate of dark matter particles is proportional to the square of
number density; therefore, the annihilation rate is large near the center of
dark matter halos especially for the new kind of dark matter structures named
ultracompact dark matter minihalos (UCMHs). In previous works, we have
investigated the potential muon neutrino flux from UCMHs due to dark matter
annihilation. Moreover, since the formation of UCMHs is related to the
primordial density perturbations of small scales, we get the constraints on the
amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbations of small scales, $1
\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{7} ~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. In this work, we focus on the
downward-going tau neutrinos from UCMHs due to dark matter annihilation.
Compared with the background of tau neutrino flux we get the constraints on the
mass fraction of UCMHs. Then using the limits on the mass fraction of UCMHs we
got the constraints on the amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbations
which are extended to the scale $k \sim 10^{8} ~ \rm Mpc^{-1}$ compared with
previous results.

with a destination with the help of N full-duplex relay nodes. Most practical
systems today route information from the source to the destination using the
best path that connects them. In this paper, we show that routing can in the
worst case result in an unbounded gap from the network capacity - or reversely,
physical layer cooperation can offer unbounded gains over routing. More
specifically, we show that for $N$-relay Gaussian networks with an arbitrary
topology, routing can in the worst case guarantee an approximate fraction
$\frac{1}{\left\lfloor N/2 \right\rfloor + 1}$ of the capacity of the full
network, independently of the SNR regime. We prove that this guarantee is
fundamental, i.e., it is the highest worst-case guarantee that we can provide
for routing in relay networks. Next, we consider how these guarantees are
refined for Gaussian layered relay networks with $L$ layers and $N_L$ relays
per layer. We prove that for arbitrary $L$ and $N_L$, there always exists a
route in the network that approximately achieves at least $\frac{2}{(L-1)N_L +
4}$ $\left(\mbox{resp.}\frac{2}{LN_L+2}\right)$ of the network capacity for odd
$L$ (resp. even $L$), and there exist networks where the best routes exactly
achieve these fractions. These results are formulated within the network
simplification framework, that asks what fraction of the capacity we can
achieve by using a subnetwork (in our case, a single path). A fundamental step
in our proof is a simplification result for MIMO antenna selection that may
also be of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

viewers' access pattern to video streams follows a long tail distribution, for
the video streams with low access rate, we propose to transcode them in an
on-demand manner using cloud computing services. The challenge in utilizing
cloud services for on-demand video transcoding is to maintain a robust QoS for
viewers and cost-efficiency for streaming service providers. To address this
challenge, we present the Cloud-based Video Streaming Services (CVS2)
architecture. It includes a QoS-aware scheduling that maps transcoding tasks to
the VMs by considering the affinity of the transcoding tasks with the allocated
heterogeneous VMs. To maintain robustness in the presence of varying streaming
requests, the architecture includes a cost-efficient VM Provisioner. This
component provides a self- configurable cluster of heterogeneous VMs. The
cluster is reconfigured dynamically to maintain the maximum affinity with the
arriving workload. Results obtained under diverse workload conditions
demonstrate that CVS2 architecture can maintain a robust QoS for viewers while
reducing the incurred cost of the streaming service provider up to 85%

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hardware Trojan detection and protection is becoming more crucial as more
untrusted third parties manufacture many parts of critical systems nowadays.
The most common way to detect hardware Trojans is comparing the untrusted
design with a golden (trusted) one. However, third-party intellectual
properties (IPs) are black boxes with no golden IPs to trust. So, previous
attempts to detect hardware Trojans will not work with third-party IPs. In this
work, we present novel methods for Trojan protection and detection on field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) without the need for golden chips. Presented
methods work at runtime instead of test time. We provide a wide spectrum of
Trojan detection and protection methods. While the simplest methods have low
overhead and provide limited protection mechanisms, more sophisticated and
costly techniques are introduced that can detect hardware Trojans and even
clean up the system from infected IPs. Moreover, we study the cost of using the
FPGA partial reconfiguration feature to get rid of infected IPs. In addition,
we discuss the possibility to construct IP core certificate authority that
maintains a centralized database of unsafe vendors and IPs. We show the
practicality of the introduced schemes by implementing the different
methodologies on FPGAs. Results show that simple methods present negligible
overheads and as we try to increase security the delay and power overheads
increase.

quantum, coloured or nonlocal. All have been shown potential to offer an energy

  In this paper, we begin by pointing out the importance of storing the data in

periods of the oscillations are about one hour. In H$\alpha$ the period
decreases with time and exhibits strong damping. The analysis of 171~\AA\

and a subsequent oscillation with a shorter period. In this wavelength the
damping appears weaker than in H$\alpha$. The velocity is the largest ever
detected in a prominence oscillation, approximately 100 $\mathrm{\, km \,

seismological techniques we determine that the radii of curvature of the field

following a resource-centric approach that uses dynamic key partitioning across
the parallel instances, i.e. executors, to balance the workload and scale
operators. However, such operator-level key repartitioning needs global
synchronization and prohibits rapid elasticity. To address this problem, we
propose an executor-centric approach, whose core idea is to avoid
operator-level key repartitioning while implementing each executor as the
building block of elasticity. Following this new approach, we design the
Elasticutor framework with two level of optimizations: i) a novel
implementation of executors, i.e., elastic executors, that perform elastic
multi-core execution via efficient intra-executor load balancing and executor
scaling and ii) a global model-based scheduler that dynamically allocates CPU
cores to executors based on the instantaneous workloads. We implemented a
prototype of Elasticutor and conducted extensive experiments. Our results show
that Elasticutor doubles the throughput and achieves an average processing
latency up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than previous methods, for a dynamic

Further, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game are validated for
both pricing schemes. At last, the performance evaluation shows that the ESP
intends to set the maximum possible value as the optimal price for profit
maximization under uniform pricing. In addition, the discriminatory pricing
helps the ESP encourage higher total service demand from miners and achieve

fixes the product of the Hubble constant and the acoustic scale $H_0 r_d$.
Therefore, regardless of the dark energy dynamics, to accommodate a higher
value of $H_0$ one needs a lower $r_d$ and so necessarily a modification of
early time cosmology. One must either reduce the age of the Universe at the
drag epoch or else the speed of sound in the primordial plasma. The first can
be achieved, for example, with dark radiation or very early dark energy,
automatically preserving the angular size of the acoustic scale in the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) with no modifications to post-recombination dark
energy. However it is known that the simplest such modifications fall afoul of
CMB constraints at higher multipoles. As an example, we combine anisotropic BAO
with geometric measurements from strong lensing time delays from H0LiCOW and
megamasers from the Megamaser Cosmology Project to measure $r_d$, with and
without the local distance ladder measurement of $H_0$. We find that the best
fit value of $r_d$ is indeed quite insensitive to the dark energy model, and is
also hardly affected by the inclusion of the local distance ladder data.

two-stage Stackelberg game, where the service provider and content provider act
as the leaders determining the pricing and sponsoring strategies, respectively,

demand in the second stage. We investigate the mutual interaction of the
service provider and content provider in two cases: (i) competitive case, where
the content provider and service provider optimize their strategies separately

respectively; and (ii) cooperative case, where the two providers jointly
optimize their strategies, with the purpose of maximizing their aggregate

extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the network effects significantly
improve the payoff of three entities in this market, i.e., utilities of users,

clamped, also known as the inverted foil, exhibits a wide range of complex
self-induced flapping regimes such as large amplitude flapping (LAF), deformed
and flipped flapping. Here, we perform three-dimensional numerical experiments
to examine the role of vortex shedding and the vortex-vortex interaction on the
LAF response at Reynolds number Re=30,000. Here we investigate the dynamics of
the inverted foil for a novel configuration wherein we introduce a fixed
splitter plate at the trailing edge to suppress the vortex shedding from
trailing edge and inhibit the interaction between the counter-rotating
vortices. We find that the inhibition of the interaction has an insignificant
effect on the transverse flapping amplitudes, due to a relatively weaker
coupling between the counter-rotating vortices emanating from the leading edge
and trailing edge. However, the inhibition of the trailing edge vortex reduces
the streamwise flapping amplitude, the flapping frequency and the net strain
energy of foil. To further generalize our understanding of the LAF, we next
perform low-Reynolds number (Re$\in[0.1,50]$) simulations for the identical
foil properties to realize the impact of vortex shedding on the large amplitude
flapping. Due to the absence of vortex shedding process in the low-$Re$ regime,
the inverted foil no longer exhibits the periodic flapping. However, the
flexible foil still loses its stability through divergence instability to
undergo a large static deformation. Finally, we introduce an analogous
analytical model for the LAF based on the dynamics of an elastically mounted
flat plate undergoing flow-induced pitching oscillations in a uniform stream.

99% in machine translation tasks without performance loss. In both tasks, the

  Comparative Analysis","47 pages; 10 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Comparative analysis of three stabilization mechanisms of unstable states of
physical systems is presented in this review. These mechanisms are: the quantum
Zeno effect, the stabilization of unstable states in an external fast
oscillating field (i.e. the Kapitza pendulum), and the mechanism named as the
spinning top mechanism. The common features of these mechanisms, as well as the
differences between them, are analyzed in the paper. In particular, it is shown
that the stabilization of quantum systems is possible without involvement of
such concept as the collapse of wave function. For stabilization it is
sufficient to have a stabilizing radiation flow with the Rabi frequency of
transitions exceeding some frequency. This frequency is inversely proportional
to the lifetime of the state under stabilization. It is shown that the Top
principle allows stabilizing unstable systems using affecting only those states
to which these systems must go over.
  It is shown that stabilization of unstable states by impact of rapidly
oscillating forces occurs by non-self-consistent exposure, i.e. the dynamics of
stabilizing field is independent on the dynamics of the stabilized state.

continuum SGP modeling are highlighted and discussed. Local strain hardening
promoted by geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) in the vicinity of the
crack leads to much higher stresses, relative to classical plasticity
predictions. These differences increase significantly when large strains are
taken into account, as a consequence of the contribution of strain gradients to
the work hardening of the material. The magnitude of stress elevation at the
crack tip and the distance ahead of the crack where GNDs significantly alter
the stress distributions are quantified. The SGP dominated zone extends over
meaningful physical lengths that could embrace the critical distance of several
damage mechanisms, being particularly relevant for hydrogen assisted cracking
models. A major role of a certain length parameter is observed in the multiple
parameter version of the phenomenological SGP theory. Since this also dominates
the mechanics of indentation testing, results suggest that length parameters
characteristic of mode I fracture should be inferred from nanoindentation.

we consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common
signal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the
nonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power
transfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In
this paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the
optimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of
the ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In
particular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints
at the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite
polynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacity-achieving input
distribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with
a finite number of mass points. Furthermore, we show that the optimal input
distribution for the same problem without PP constraint is discrete whenever
the EH constraint is active and continuous zero-mean Gaussian, otherwise. Our
numerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP
constraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to
the AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.

Brunn-Minkowski inequality. Our main result confirms this conjecture locally
for all (smooth) origin-symmetric convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $p \in [1
- \frac{c}{n^{3/2}},1)$. In addition, we confirm the local log-Brunn--Minkowski
conjecture (the case $p=0$) for small-enough $C^2$-perturbations of the
unit-ball of $\ell_q^n$ for $q \geq 2$, when the dimension $n$ is sufficiently
large, as well as for the cube, which we show is the conjectural extremal case.
For unit-balls of $\ell_q^n$ with $q \in [1,2)$, we confirm an analogous result
for $p=c \in (0,1)$, a universal constant. It turns out that the local version
of these conjectures is equivalent to a minimization problem for a spectral-gap
parameter associated with a certain differential operator, introduced by
Hilbert (under different normalization) in his proof of the Brunn-Minkowski
inequality. As applications, we obtain local uniqueness results in the even
$L^p$-Minkowski problem, as well as improved stability estimates in the
Brunn-Minkowski and anisotropic isoperimetric inequalities.

volatility in the electricity generation. Previous studies have shown that
storage devices provide an opportunity to balance fluctuations in the power
grid. An economical operation of these devices is linked to solutions of
probabilistic optimization problems, due to the fact that future generation is
not deterministic in general. For this reason, reliable forecast methods as
well as appropriate robust optimization algorithms take an increasingly
important role in future power operation systems. Taking an uncertain
availability of electricity into account, we present a method to calculate
cost-optimal charging strategies for energy storage units. The proposed method
solves subproblems which result from a sliding window approach applied on a
linear program by utilizing statistical measures. The prerequisite of this
method is a recently developed fast algorithm for storage-related optimization
problems. To present the potential of the proposed method, a Power-To-Heat
storage system is investigated as an example using today's available forecast

is compared with a common robust optimization method for stochastic scenario
problems. In comparison, the proposed method provides lower acquisition costs,
especially for today's available forecasts, and is more robust under
perturbations in terms of deteriorating predictions, both based on empirical
analyses. Furthermore, the introduced approach is applicable to general
cost-optimal operation problems and also real-time optimization concerning

achieved by collisions of the particles with a combination of a moving atomic
mirror and a moving atom diode. An atom diode is a unidirectional barrier, i.e.
an optical device through which an atom can pass in one direction only. We show
that the efficiency of the scheme depends on the trajectory of the diode and
the mirror. We examine both the classical and quantum mechanical descriptions
of the scheme, along with the numerical simulations to show the efficiency in

an essential preprocessing step for a wide range of analyses. Variability in
contrast, appearance, orientation, and placement of the heart between patients,
clinical views, scanners, and protocols makes fully automatic semantic
segmentation a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we present ${\Omega}$-Net
(Omega-Net): a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for
simultaneous localization, transformation into a canonical orientation, and
semantic segmentation. First, an initial segmentation is performed on the input
image, second, the features learned during this initial segmentation are used
to predict the parameters needed to transform the input image into a canonical
orientation, and third, a final segmentation is performed on the transformed
image. In this work, ${\Omega}$-Nets of varying depths were trained to detect
five foreground classes in any of three clinical views (short axis, SA,
four-chamber, 4C, two-chamber, 2C), without prior knowledge of the view being
segmented. The architecture was trained on a cohort of patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and healthy control subjects. Network performance
as measured by weighted foreground intersection-over-union (IoU) was
substantially improved in the best-performing ${\Omega}$- Net compared with
U-Net segmentation without localization or orientation. In addition,
{\Omega}-Net was retrained from scratch on the 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset, and
achieves state-of-the-art results on the LV and RV bloodpools, and performed
slightly worse in segmentation of the LV myocardium. We conclude this
architecture represents a substantive advancement over prior approaches, with
implications for biomedical image segmentation more generally.

$\phi$-meson photoproduction from helium-4 have been measured for the first
time at forward angles with linearly polarized photons in the energy range
$E_{\gamma} = \text{1.685-2.385 GeV}$. Thanks to the target with spin-parity
$J^{P} = 0^{+}$, unnatural-parity exchanges are prohibited, and thus
natural-parity exchanges can be investigated clearly. The decay asymmetry with
respect to photon polarization is shown to be very close to the maximal value.
This ensures the dominance ($> 94\%$) of natural-parity exchanges in this
reaction. To evaluate the contribution from natural-parity exchanges to the
forward cross section ($\theta = 0^\circ$) for the $\gamma p \rightarrow \phi
p$ reaction near the threshold, the energy dependence of the forward cross
section ($\theta = 0^\circ$) for the $\gamma {^{4}\text{He}} \rightarrow \phi

additional attention to coordination and management. At this level, there is an
increasing need to standardize best practices to avoid reinvention and

enterprise software delivery can have significant impact on the adoption of
agile approaches. As a consequence, agile strategies will typically need to be
evaluated, tailored, and perhaps combined with traditional approaches to suit
the particular context. The characteristics of software products and software
development processes open up new possibilities that are different from those
offered in other domains to achieve leanness and flexibility. Whilst Lean

knowledge. For instance, if you are a skilled violinist, you will likely have
an easier time learning to play cello. Similarly, when learning a new language
you take advantage of the languages you already speak. For instance, if your
native language is Norwegian and you decide to learn Dutch, the lexical overlap
between these two languages will likely benefit your rate of language
acquisition. This thesis deals with the intersection of learning multiple tasks
and learning multiple languages in the context of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), which can be defined as the study of computational processing of human
language. Although these two types of learning may seem different on the
surface, we will see that they share many similarities.
  The traditional approach in NLP is to consider a single task for a single
language at a time. However, recent advances allow for broadening this
approach, by considering data for multiple tasks and languages simultaneously.
This is an important approach to explore further as the key to improving the
reliability of NLP, especially for low-resource languages, is to take advantage
of all relevant data whenever possible. In doing so, the hope is that in the
long term, low-resource languages can benefit from the advances made in NLP
which are currently to a large extent reserved for high-resource languages.
This, in turn, may then have positive consequences for, e.g., language
preservation, as speakers of minority languages will have a lower degree of
pressure to using high-resource languages. In the short term, answering the
specific research questions posed should be of use to NLP researchers working
towards the same goal.

This error measure is based on an approximation of the full variance $\langle

matrix-product states at different bond dimensions obtained from a single-site
density matrix renormalization group (1DMRG) calculation, it allows for the
extrapolation of observables towards the zero-error case representing the exact
ground state of the system. The calculation of the error measure is split into
a sequential part of cost equivalent to two calculations of $\langle \psi |
\hat H | \psi \rangle$ and a trivially parallelized part scaling like a single
operator application in 2DMRG. The reliability of the new error measure is
demonstrated at four examples: the $L=30, S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain, the
$L=50$ Hubbard chain, an electronic model with long-range Coulomb-like
interactions and the Hubbard model on a cylinder of size $10 \times 4$.

scattering. However certain particles are not scattered, but perforate the
wall. As a result, the wall gets excited in the form of the branon wave, while
the particle experiences an acceleration jump. This gives rise to generation of
gravitational waves which we call ""piercing gravitational radiation"" (PGR).
Though this effect is of higher order in the gravitational constant than the
quadrupole radiation from the collapsing DWs, its amplitude is enhanced in the
case of relativistic particles or photons because of absence of the velocity
factor which is present in the quadrupole formula. We derive the
spectral-angular distribution of PGR within the simplified model of the weakly
gravitating particle-wall system in Minkowski space-time of arbitrary
dimensions. Within this model the radiation amplitude is obtained analytically.
The spectral-angular distribution of PGR in such an approach suffers from
infrared and ultraviolet divergences as well as from collinear divergence in
the case of a massless perforating particle. Different cut-off schemes
appropriate in various dimensions are discussed. Our results are applicable
both to cosmological DWs and to the braneworld models.

Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) which overcomes limitations of current approaches.
Up to now, all major IACT experiments rely on the same Monte-Carlo simulation
strategy, using predefined observation and instrument settings. Simulations
with varying parameters are generated to provide better estimates of the
Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) of different observations. However, a
large fraction of the simulation configuration remains preserved, leading to
complete negligence of all related influences. Additionally, the simulation
scheme relies on interpolations between different array configurations, which
are never fully reproducing the actual configuration for a given observation.
Interpolations are usually performed on zenith angles, off-axis angles, array
multiplicity, and the optical response of the instrument. With the advent of
hybrid systems consisting of a large number of IACTs with different sizes,
types, and camera configurations, the complexity of the interpolation and the
size of the phase space becomes increasingly prohibitive. Going beyond the
existing approaches, we introduce a new simulation and analysis concept which
takes into account the actual observation conditions as well as individual
telescope configurations of each observation run of a given data set. These
run-wise simulations (RWS) thus exhibit considerably reduced systematic
uncertainties compared to the existing approach, and are also more
computationally efficient and simple. The RWS framework has been implemented in
the H.E.S.S. software and tested, and is already being exploited in science
analysis.

temperature behaviour of lattice gauge theories. They are much simpler to
simulate than the original (3+1) dimensional LGTs and are affected by a milder
sign problem. However it is not clear to which extent they really capture the
rich spectrum of the original theories, a feature which is instead of great
importance if one aims to address the sign problem. We propose here a simple
way to address this issue based on the so called second moment correlation
length $\xi_{2nd}$. The ratio $\xi/\xi_{2nd}$ between the exponential
correlation length and the second moment one is equal to 1 if only a single
mass is present in the spectrum, and becomes larger and larger as the
complexity of the spectrum increases. Since both $\xi_{exp}$ and $\xi_{2nd}$
are easy to measure on the lattice, this is an economic and effective way to
keep track of the spectrum of the theory. In this respect we show using both
numerical simulation and effective string calculations that this ratio
increases dramatically as the temperature decreases. This non-trivial behaviour
should be reproduced by the Polyakov loop effective action.

`pinch' radii. One `pinch' radius $r_1=2.2 R_{Einst}$ is defined such that the
Einstein (i.e. aperture) mass can be converted to the spherical mass almost
independently of the mass-model. Another `pinch' radius $r_2=R_{opt}$ is chosen
so that the dynamical mass, derived from the line-of-sight velocity dispersion,
is least sensitive to the anisotropy of stellar orbits. We verified the
performance of this approach on a sample of simulated elliptical galaxies and
on a sample of 15 SLACS lens galaxies at $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.35$, which have
already been analysed in Barnabe et al. (2011) by the self-consistent joint
lensing and kinematic code. For massive simulated galaxies the density slope
$\gamma$ is recovered with an accuracy of $\sim 13\%$, unless $r_1$ and $r_2$
happen to be close to each other. For SLACS galaxies, we found good overall
agreement with the results of Barnabe et al. (2011) with a sample-averaged

statistical uncertainties, it is much simpler and uses only few arithmetic

wave consists of a finite number of coherent plane-wave pairs $\psi_n^\pm$ with
wavevector: $\mathbf{k}_n=(\pm\sqrt{k^2-(n\alpha)^2},n\alpha)$, where
$n=0,1,2,\cdots<k/\alpha$. This generalizes to the scattering of wavepackets
and suggests means for generating quantum states with a quantized component of
momentum and pairs of states with an entangled momentum. We examine a
realization of these potentials in terms of certain optical slabs. If
$k=N\alpha$ for some positive integer $N$, $\psi_N^\pm$ coalesce and their
amplitude diverge. If $k$ exceeds $N\alpha$ slightly, $\psi_N^\pm$ have a much
larger amplitude than $\psi_n^\pm$ with $n<N$. This marks a resonance effect
that arises for the scattered waves whose wavevector makes a small angle with
the faces of the slab.

protostellar disc is self-gravitating. If these discs are prone to
fragmentation, then they are able to rapidly form objects that are initially of
several Jupiter masses and larger. The fate of these disc fragments (and the
fate of planetary bodies formed afterwards via core accretion) depends
sensitively not only on the fragment's interaction with the disc, but with its
neighbouring fragments.
  We return to and revise our population synthesis model of self-gravitating
disc fragmentation and tidal downsizing. Amongst other improvements, the model
now directly incorporates fragment-fragment interactions while the disc is
still present. We find that fragment-fragment scattering dominates the orbital
evolution, even when we enforce rapid migration and inefficient gap formation.
  Compared to our previous model, we see a small increase in the number of
terrestrial-type objects being formed, although their survival under tidal
evolution is at best unclear. We also see evidence for disrupted fragments with
evolved grain populations - this is circumstantial evidence for the formation
of planetesimal belts, a phenomenon not seen in runs where fragment-fragment
interactions are ignored.
  In spite of intense dynamical evolution, our population is dominated by
massive giant planets and brown dwarfs at large semimajor axis, which direct
imaging surveys should, but only rarely, detect. Finally, disc fragmentation is
shown to be an efficient manufacturer of free floating planetary mass objects,
and the typical multiplicity of systems formed via gravitational instability
will be low.

differential operator by the Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method. The HHO method is
formulated using cell and face unknowns which are polynomials of some degree
$k\geq0$. The key idea for the discrete eigenvalue problem is to introduce a
discrete operator where the face unknowns have been eliminated. Using the
abstract theory of spectral approximation of compact operators in Hilbert
spaces, we prove that the eigenvalues converge as $h^{2t}$ and the
eigenfunctions as $h^{t}$ in the $H^1$-seminorm, where $h$ is the mesh-size,
$t\in [s,k+1]$ depends on the smoothness of the eigenfunctions, and $s>\frac12$
results from the elliptic regularity theory. The convergence rates for smooth
eigenfunctions are thus $h^{2k+2}$ for the eigenvalues and $h^{k+1}$ for the
eigenfunctions. Our theoretical findings, which improve recent error estimates
for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, are verified on various
numerical examples including smooth and non-smooth eigenfunctions. Moreover, we
observe numerically in one dimension for smooth eigenfunctions that the
eigenvalues superconverge as $h^{2k+4}$ for a specific value of the
stabilization parameter.

incremental aggregated gradient (PLIAG) method, for minimizing the sum of a
convex function that consists of additive relatively smooth convex components
and a proper lower semi-continuous convex regularization function, over an
abstract feasible set whose geometry can be captured by using the domain of a
Legendre function. The PLIAG method includes many existing algorithms in the
literature as special cases such as the proximal gradient method, the Bregman
proximal gradient method (also called NoLips algorithm), the incremental
aggregated gradient method, the incremental aggregated proximal method, and the
proximal incremental aggregated gradient method. It also includes some novel
interesting iteration schemes. First we show the PLIAG method is globally
sublinearly convergent without requiring a growth condition, which extends the
sublinear convergence result for the proximal gradient algorithm to incremental
aggregated type first order methods. Then by embedding a so-called Bregman
distance growth condition into a descent-type lemma to construct a special
Lyapunov function, we show that the PLIAG method is globally linearly
convergent in terms of both function values and Bregman distances to the
optimal solution set, provided that the step size is not greater than some
positive constant. These convergence results derived in this paper are all
established beyond the standard assumptions in the literature (i.e., without
requiring the strong convexity and the Lipschitz gradient continuity of the
smooth part of the objective). When specialized to many existing algorithms,
our results recover or supplement their convergence results under strictly
weaker conditions.

Technology Madras, Chennai, India. The objective is to study the precipitation
of high energy electrons and protons from Van-Allen radiation belts to lower
altitude of 600-900 km due to resonance interaction with low frequency EM
waves. The unique communications system design of IITMSAT evolves from the
challenging downlink data requirement of 1 MB per day in the UHF band posed by
the mission and the satellite's payload, SPEED (Space based Proton and Electron
Energy Detector). To ensure continuous downlink data stream in the short Low
earth Orbit passes, a robust physical layer protocol was designed to counter
time-varying aspects of a Space-Earth telecom link. For the on-board
communications system, two types of design alternatives exist for each module.
The first option is a custom design wherein a module is developed from scratch
using discrete components.The other option is an integrated design wherein an
electronics COTS module can be directly plugged into the subsystem. This module
is evaluated by carrying out vibration and thermal tests. If an integrated
module is low-cost and meets the design requirements, it is preferred over a
custom design. In order to carry out performance tests under simulated link
conditions, an RF attenuation test setup was designed that can work at extreme
temperatures. Burn-In tests for 72 hours at ambient and extreme temperatures
were carried out. Integrated tests indicate all IITMSAT design requirements
have been met. Hence a robust communications system has been validated. The
time taken for development of on-board telecom and GS was less than a year and
was achieved at a low cost which agrees to a LeanSat approach.

Generally, the profiles strongly differ between particles leading and lagging

particle. At small axial distances, they are determined by viscous forces,
while inertial forces dominate at large separations. Depending on the initial
conditions, the two-particle lift forces in combination with the Poiseuille
flow give rise to three types of unbound particle trajectories, called
moving-apart, passing, and swapping, and one type of bound trajectories, where
the particles perform damped oscillations. The damping rate scales with
Reynolds number squared, since inertial forces are responsible for driving the
particles to their steady-state positions.

the circular velocity. This translates to average peculiar motions towards the
Galaxy centre and opposite to Galactic rotation. These results may be sensitive

running time for the classic k-median and k-means clustering objectives (where
n is the size of the input), even in low-dimensional Euclidean space of
dimension four, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We also
consider k-median (and k-means) with penalties where each point need not be
assigned to a center, in which case it must pay a penalty, and extend our lower
bound to at least three-dimensional Euclidean space.
  This stands in stark contrast to many other geometric problems such as the
traveling salesman problem, or computing an independent set of unit spheres.
While these problems benefit from the so-called (limited) blessing of
dimensionality, as they can be solved in time $n^{O(k^{1-1/d})}$ or
$2^{n^{1-1/d}}$ in d dimensions, our work shows that widely-used clustering
objectives have a lower bound of $n^{\Omega(k)}$, even in dimension four.
  We complete the picture by considering the two-dimensional case: we show that
there is no algorithm that solves the penalized version in time less than
$n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$, and provide a matching upper bound of $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$.
  The main tool we use to establish these lower bounds is the placement of
points on the moment curve, which takes its inspiration from constructions of
point sets yielding Delaunay complexes of high complexity.

process where billions of DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a donor are mapped
onto a reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor.
State-of-the-art read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations
for seeds (i.e., smaller segments) within each read, 2) extract reference
sequences at each of the mapping locations, and 3) check similarity between
each read and its associated reference sequences with a
computationally-expensive algorithm (i.e., sequence alignment) to determine the
origin of the read. A seed location filter comes into play before alignment,
discarding seed locations that alignment would deem a poor match. The ideal
seed location filter would discard all poor match locations prior to alignment
such that there is no wasted computation on unnecessary alignments.
  Results: We propose a novel seed location filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter,
optimized to exploit 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation
within a logic layer stacked under memory layers, to perform
processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters seed locations by 1)
introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference
genome, and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read
presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for a
sequence alignment error tolerance of 0.05, GRIM-Filter 1) reduces the false
negative rate of filtering by 5.59x--6.41x, and 2) provides an end-to-end read
mapper speedup of 1.81x--3.65x, compared to a state-of-the-art read mapper
employing the best previous seed location filtering algorithm.

leaving it intact. We identify such events in the scintillator of MINERvA by

integrated differential cross sections as a function of $Q^2$, $E_\pi$ and
$\theta_\pi$. The $Q^2$ dependence and equality of the neutrino and

work on these systems has shown that strong electron-phonon coupling leads to a
large contribution to photoemission and gain from phonon-assisted emission and
absorption processes. We compare the effects of this phonon sideband in three
commonly investigated gate-defined quantum dot material systems: InAs nanowires
and GaAs and Si two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). We compare our theory
with existing experimental data from cavity-coupled InAs nanowire and GaAs 2DEG
double quantum dots and find quantitative agreement only when the phonon
sideband and photoemission processes during lead tunneling are taken into
account. Finally we show that the phonon sideband also leads to a sizable
renormalization of the cavity frequency, which allows for direct spectroscopic
probes of the electron-phonon coupling in these systems.

digital channel above which a controller that only receives state information

a class of partially hyperbolic sets. More precisely, we assume that $Q$ is a
compact controlled invariant set of a control-affine system whose extended
tangent bundle decomposes into two invariant subbundles $E^+$ and $E^{0-}$ with
uniform expansion on $E^+$ and weak contraction on $E^{0-}$. Under the
additional assumptions that $Q$ is isolated and that the $u$-fibers of $Q$ vary
lower semicontinuously with the control $u$, we derive a lower bound on the
invariance entropy of $Q$ in terms of relative topological pressure with
respect to the unstable determinant. Under the assumption that this bound is
tight, our result provides a first quantitative explanation for the fact that
the invariance entropy does not only depend on the dynamical complexity on the

Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) selected selected through a systematic search of

Candidates are identified by looking for compound spectra, where emission lines
at a redshift larger than that of the quasar can be identified in the residuals
after a QSO spectral template is subtracted from the observed spectra. The
narrow diameter of BOSS fibers (2"") then ensures that the object responsible
for the additional emission lines must lie close to the line of sight of the
QSO and hence provides a high probability of lensing. Among the 12 candidates
identified, 9 have definite evidence for the presence of a background ELG
identified by at least 4 higher-redshift nebular emission lines. The remaining
$3$ probable candidates present a strong asymmetrical emission line attributed
to a background Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE). The QSO-ELG (QSO-LAE) lens
candidates have QSO lens redshifts in the range $0.24\lesssim z_{QSO} \lesssim
0.66$ ($0.75 \lesssim z_{QSO} \lesssim 1.23$ ) and background galaxy redshifts
in the range $0.48 \lesssim z_{S,ELG} \lesssim 0.94$ ($2.17 \lesssim z_{S,LAE}

QSO-ELG systems, whereas it falls at 40-60% for QSO-LAE, depending on the
redshift of the source. Upon confirmation of the lensing nature of the systems,
this sample may quadruple the number of known QSOs acting as strong lenses. We
have determined the completeness of our search, which allows future studies to
compute lensing probabilities of galaxies by QSOs and differentiate between
different QSO models. (Abridged)

Schwarzschild solution becomes unstable and new branch of solutions with
nontrivial scalar field bifurcate from the Schwarzschild one. As a matter of
fact, more than one branches with nontrivial scalar field can bifurcate at
different masses but only the first one is supposed to be stable. This effect
is quite similar to the spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars. In contrast
with the standard spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars which is induced
by the presence of matter, in our case the scalarization is induced by the
curvature of the spacetime.

systems whose energy fluctuations are negligible compared to their average
energy. Here, we push beyond this thermodynamic limit by developing a
mathematical framework to rigorously address the problem of thermodynamic
transformations of finite-size systems. More formally, we analyse state
interconversion under thermal operations and between arbitrary
energy-incoherent states. We find precise relations between the optimal rate at
which interconversion can take place and the desired infidelity of the final
state when the system size is sufficiently large. These so-called second-order
asymptotics provide a bridge between the extreme cases of single-shot
thermodynamics and the asymptotic limit of infinitely large systems. We
illustrate the utility of our results with several examples. We first show how
thermodynamic cycles are affected by irreversibility due to finite-size
effects. We then provide a precise expression for the gap between the
distillable work and work of formation that opens away from the thermodynamic
limit. Finally, we explain how the performance of a heat engine gets affected
when one of the heat baths it operates between is finite. We find that while
perfect work cannot generally be extracted at Carnot efficiency, there are
conditions under which these finite-size effects vanish. In deriving our
results we also clarify relations between different notions of approximate
majorisation.

processing visual and temporal information effectively. Convolutional Neural
Networks have shown promise as baseline fixed feature extractors through
transfer learning, a technique that helps minimize the training cost on visual
information. Temporal information is often handled using hand-crafted features
or Recurrent Neural Networks, but this can be overly specific or prohibitively
complex. Building a fully trainable system that can efficiently analyze
spatio-temporal data without hand-crafted features or complex training is an
open challenge. We present a new neural network architecture to address this
challenge, the Convolutional Drift Network (CDN). Our CDN architecture combines
the visual feature extraction power of deep Convolutional Neural Networks with
the intrinsically efficient temporal processing provided by Reservoir
Computing. In this introductory paper on the CDN, we provide a very simple
baseline implementation tested on two egocentric (first-person) video activity
datasets.We achieve video-level activity classification results on-par with
state-of-the art methods. Notably, performance on this complex spatio-temporal
task was produced by only training a single feed-forward layer in the CDN.

$\Psi \in \mathcal{R}^{m\times n}$, and $\epsilon$ is the random error before

challenging to decode from the 1-bit CS. In this paper, we consider least

so-called primal and dual active set (PDAS) algorithm, to solve the nonsmooth

It only requires to solve a small least squares problem on the active set.
Therefore, the PDAS is extremely efficient for recovering sparse signals

tuning the ratio, $\hbar\omega_{\gamma} / k_{\rm B} \Delta T$, between the

the Laughlin and Moore-Read ground states and their quasihole excitations. In
this paper, we extend the matrix product state techniques to evaluate
quasielectron wave functions, a more complex task because the corresponding
conformal field theory operator is not local. We use our method to obtain
density profiles for states with multiple quasielectrons and quasiholes, and to
calculate the (mutual) statistical phases of the excitations with high
precision. The wave functions we study are subject to a known difficulty: the
position of a quasielectron depends on the presence of other quasiparticles,
even when their separation is large compared to the magnetic length.
Quasielectron wave functions constructed using the composite fermion picture,
which are topologically equivalent to the quasielectrons we study, have the
same problem. This flaw is serious in that it gives wrong results for the
statistical phases obtained by braiding distant quasiparticles. We analyze this
problem in detail and show that it originates from an incomplete screening of
the topological charges, which invalidates the plasma analogy. We demonstrate
that this can be remedied in the case when the separation between the
quasiparticles is large, which allows us to obtain the correct statistical
phases. Finally, we propose that a modification of the Laughlin state, that
allows for local quasielectron operators, should have good topological
properties for arbitrary configurations of excitations.

clusters within a data set of conductance versus displacement traces measured
from single molecular break junctions (Lemmer, et al, Nature Communications,
2016, 7, 12922). An idealized blank tunneling trace was used as a reference to
calculate three vector variables. The authors suggested a more appropriate
reference can be chosen to better form clusters in the data. Here we propose
using a principal component of the correlation matrix calculated from the data
set to construct a fast and strategic reference trace. Principal components
form an orthogonal basis set in units of the independent variables comprising
the correlation matrix. The first principal component, the one corresponding to
the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix, points in the direction of
largest variance in the data. We used both a blank tunneling reference trace
and a reference trace constructed from the first principal component of the
correlation matrix to analyze a set of 4,4'-bipyridine single molecular break
junctions. The blank tunneling reference trace produced a single elongated
cluster in the vector analysis plot whereas the reference trace constructed
from the principal component distinguished two arms in the cluster. We
hypothesize that these two arms are due to groups of traces with either long or
short molecular plateaus. Statistically based sorting algorithms, like
vector-based categorization techniques, provide an objective framework to
formulate such hypothesis and aid in designing new and pointed studies to
verify them.

bracket and Laplacian structure as well as the BV effective action (EA) depend
on an effective energy scale. The BV EA at a certain scale satisfies the BV
quantum master equation at that scale. The RG flow of the EA is implemented by
BV canonical maps intertwining the BV structures at different scales.
Infinitesimally, this generates the BV exact renormalization group equation
(RGE). We show that BV RG theory can be extended by augmenting the scale
parameter space R to its shifted tangent bundle T[1]R. The extra odd direction
in scale space allows for a BV RG supersymmetry that constrains the structure
of the BV RGE bringing it to Polchinski's form. We investigate the implications
of BV RG supersymmetry in perturbation theory. Finally, we illustrate our
findings by constructing free models of BV RG flow and EA exhibiting RG
supersymmetry in the degree -1 symplectic framework and studying the
perturbation theory thereof. We find in particular that the odd partner of
effective action describes perturbatively the deviation of the interacting RG
flow from its free counterpart.

GEM self-consistently incorporates the effects of frame dragging to lowest

attention as an alternative to Cold dark matter (CDM) and Warm dark matter
(WDM) for some time now. The BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson
(GPP) equation with an arbitrary potential allowing for either attractive or
repulsive interactions. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining exact solutions to
the GEM equations of motion without drastic approximations, we employ the
variational method to examine the conditions under which rotating condensates,
stable against gravitational collapse, may form in models with attractive and
repulsive quartic interactions. We also describe the approximate dynamics of an
imploding and rotating condensate by employing a collective coordinate
description in terms of the condensate radius.

prediction phase can be reduced to less than 5% of the original feedforward
phase with negligible accuracy loss. Furthermore, an energy-efficient hardware
architecture, SparseNN, is proposed to exploit both the input and output
sparsity. SparseNN is a scalable architecture with distributed memories and
processing elements connected through a dedicated on-chip network. Compared
with the state-of-the-art accelerators which only exploit the input sparsity,
SparseNN can achieve a 10%-70% improvement in throughput and a power reduction

the photon energy range from 0.3 MeV to 3 GeV - the lower energy limit can be
pushed to energies as low as 150 keV for the tracker, and to 30 keV for
calorimetric detection. The mission is based on an advanced space-proven
detector technology, with unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy
resolution, combined with polarimetric capability. Thanks to its performance in
the MeV-GeV domain, substantially improving its predecessors, e-ASTROGAM will
open a new window on the non-thermal Universe, making pioneering observations
of the most powerful Galactic and extragalactic sources, elucidating the nature
of their relativistic outflows and their effects on the surroundings. With a
line sensitivity in the MeV energy range one to two orders of magnitude better
than previous generation instruments, e-ASTROGAM will determine the origin of
key isotopes fundamental for the understanding of supernova explosion and the
chemical evolution of our Galaxy. The mission will provide unique data of
significant interest to a broad astronomical community, complementary to

compact set of about 500 fundamental and structural radicals. This paper
introduces a novel radical analysis network (RAN) to recognize printed Chinese
characters by identifying radicals and analyzing two-dimensional spatial
structures among them. The proposed RAN first extracts visual features from
input by employing convolutional neural networks as an encoder. Then a decoder
based on recurrent neural networks is employed, aiming at generating captions
of Chinese characters by detecting radicals and two-dimensional structures
through a spatial attention mechanism. The manner of treating a Chinese
character as a composition of radicals rather than a single character class
largely reduces the size of vocabulary and enables RAN to possess the ability
of recognizing unseen Chinese character classes, namely zero-shot learning.

Universe it is important to see how one or a set of quantum fields may evolve
such that the classical energy-momentum tensor behave similar to a cosmological
constant. In this work we consider a toy model including 3 scalar fields with
very different masses to study the formation of a light axion-like condensate,
presumed to be responsible for inflation and/or late accelerating expansion of
the Universe. Despite its simplicity, this model reflects hierarchy of masses
and couplings of the Standard Model and its candidate extensions. The
investigation is performed in the framework of non-equilibrium quantum field
theory in a consistently evolved FLRW geometry. We discuss in details how the
initial conditions for such a model must be defined in a fully quantum setup
and show that in a multi-component model interactions reduce the number of
independent initial degrees of freedom. Numerical simulation of this model
shows that it can be fully consistent with present cosmological observations.
For the chosen range of parameters we find that quantum interactions rather
than effective potential of a condensate is the dominant contributor in the
energy density of the Universe and triggers both inflation and late
accelerating expansion. Nonetheless, despite its small contribution in the
energy density, the light scalar field - in both condensate and quasi free
particle forms - has a crucial role in controlling the trend of heavier fields.
Furthermore, up to precision of our simulations we do not find any IR
singularity during inflation. These findings highlight uncertainties in
attempts to extract information about physics of the early Universe by naively
comparing predictions of local effective classical models with cosmological
observations, neglecting inherently non-local nature of quantum processes.

Lorentz-Lorentz mechanism, and the wide variations of their spectra related to
the aggregation of molecules into J- or H-aggregates. We show that the
experimental absorption spectra of H-aggregates may be correctly described only
if one takes both mechanisms into account. The bistable response of organic
materials in the condensed phase has been demonstrated using the
electron-vibrational model. We show that using molecules with long-living

different single-carrier modem schemes are considered, i.e., a traditional
modulation scheme with linear equalization at the receiver, and a
single-carrier modulation with cyclic prefix, frequency-domain equalization and
FFT-based processing at the receiver; these two schemes are compared with a

account the peculiar characteristics of MIMO channels at mmWave frequencies,
the use of hybrid (analog-digital) pre-coding and post-coding beamformers, the
finite cardinality of the modulation structure, and the non-linear behavior of
the transmitter power amplifiers. Our results show that the best performance is
achieved by single-carrier modulation with time-domain equalization, which
exhibits the smallest loss due to the non-linear distortion, and whose
performance can be further improved by using advanced equalization schemes.

extract the negative curvature from the Hessian matrix, and provide a formal

radiation and cosmic rays. I show that on time scales of $\gtrsim 10^{6}$
years, these processes lead to the formation of large percolation clusters of
organic molecules. Some of these clusters would have ended up on proto-planets
where large, loosely bound aggregates of clusters (superclusters) would have
formed. The interior regions of such superclusters provided for chemical
micro-environments that are filtered versions of the outside environment. I
argue that models for abiogenesis are more likely to work when considered
inside such micro-environments. As the supercluster breaks up, biochemical
systems in such micro-environments gradually become subject to a less filtered
environment, allowing them to get adapted to the more complex outside
environment. A particular system originating from a particular location on some
supercluster would have been the first to get adapted to the raw outside
environment and survive there, thereby becoming the first microbe. A collision
of a microbe-containing proto-planet with the Moon could have led to fragments
veering off back into space, microbes in small fragments would have been able
to survive a subsequent impact with the Earth.

in the literature, although these combinatorial structures completely classify
AF algebras. In general, the addition operation of an Elliott local semigroup
is {\it partial}, but for every AF algebra $\mathfrak B$ whose Murray-von
Neumann order of projections is a lattice, this operation is uniquely
extendible to the addition of an involutive monoid $E(\mathfrak B)$. Let
$\mathfrak M_1$ be the Farey AF algebra introduced by the present author in
1988 and rediscovered by F. Boca in 2008. The freeness properties of the
involutive monoid $E(\mathfrak M_1)$ yield a natural word problem for every AF
algebra $\mathfrak B$ with singly generated $E(\mathfrak B)$, because
$\mathfrak B$ is automatically a quotient of $\mathfrak M_1$. Given two
formulas $\phi$ and $\psi$ in the language of involutive monoids, the problem
asks to decide whether $\phi$ and $\psi$ code the same equivalence of
projections of $\mathfrak B$. This mimics the classical definition of the word
problem of a group presented by generators and relations. We show that the word
problem of $\mathfrak M_1$ is solvable in polynomial time, and so is the word
problem of the Behnke-Leptin algebras $\mathcal A_{n,k}$, and of the
Effros-Shen algebras $\mathfrak F_{\theta}$, for $\theta\in [0,1]\setminus

from factoid to structured operating procedures; the knowledge is present
across heterogeneous data sources like application specific documentation,
ticket management systems and any single technique for a general purpose

built a cognitive platform with capabilities adopted for this domain. Further,
we have built a general purpose question answering system leveraging the

orchestrates across a deep learning classifier, a knowledge graph based context

orchestration performs context switching for a provided question and also does
a smooth hand-off of the question to a human expert if none of the automated

Moreover, the base station transfers power to the nodes by using Wireless Power
Transfer (WPT) to extend their battery life. However, inadequately scheduling
WPT and data collection causes some of the nodes to drain their battery and
have their data buffer overflow, while the other nodes waste their harvested
energy, which is more than they need to transmit their packets. In this paper,
we investigate a novel optimal scheduling strategy, called EHMDP, aiming to
minimize data packet loss from a network of sensor nodes in terms of the nodes'
energy consumption and data queue state information. The scheduling problem is
first formulated by a centralized MDP model, assuming that the complete states
of each node are well known by the base station. This presents the upper bound
of the data that can be collected in a rechargeable wireless sensor network.
Next, we relax the assumption of the availability of full state information so
that the data transmission and WPT can be semi-decentralized. The simulation
results show that, in terms of network throughput and packet loss rate, the

is the process of making strong continuous filaments through hydrodynamic
alignment and assembly of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) demonstrated by
H{\aa}kansson et al. [Nature communications 5, 2014]. In this process it is
vital to study the alignment of the nanofibrils in the flow, as this in turn
affects the final material properties of the dried filament. Small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) is a well-suited characterization technique for this, which
typically provides the alignment in a projected plane perpendicular to the beam
direction. In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to reconstruct the full
three-dimensional (3D) orientation distribution function (ODF) from a
SAXS-experiment through the assumption that the azimuthal angle of the
nanofibril around the flow direction is distributed uniformly; an assumption
that is approximately valid in the flow-focusing process. For demonstrational
purposes, the experimental results from H{\aa}kansson et al. (2014) have been
revised, resulting in a small correction to the presented order parameters. The
results are then directly compared with simple numerical models to describe the
increased alignment of CNF both in the flowing system and during the drying
process. The proposed reconstruction method will allow for further improvements
of theoretical or numerical simulations and consequently open up new
possibilities for optimizing assembly processes, which include flow-alignment

the maximal direction. It is found that the intensity of uniformly accelerated
cusp motion scales like non-uniformly accelerated synchrotron radiation. We
confirm the exact vacuum excitation spectra of quantized field detectors on the
world line.

beginning learners to perfectly master its essence. In opposition of a delivery
of the contents in an academic and vertical course, the knowledge is broken
into exercises which are left to the learners for solutions. Hints are present
at any corner to help readers to achieve the solutions. In that way, the
knowledge is constructed by the readers by summarizing the results of one or a
group of exercises.
  Each chapter is organized into Summary documents which contain the knowledge,
Discovery documents which give the learner the opportunity to extract the
knowledge himself through exercises and into Solution Documents which offer
detailed answers for the exercises. Exceptionally, a few number of results (A
key lemma related the justification of definition of the integral of a
non-negative function, the Caratheodory's theorem and the Lebesgue-Stieljes
measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$) are presented in appendix documents and given for
reading in small groups.
  The full theory is presented in the described way. We highly expect that any
student who goes through the materials, alone or in a small group or under the
supervision of an assistant will gain a very solid knowledge in the subject and
by the way ensure a sound foundation for studying disciplines such as
Probability Theory, Statistics, Functional Analysis, etc.
  The materials have been successfully used as such in normal real analysis
classes several times.

determination of their emission efficiency, which ultimately defines the
potential of the developed materials. For this, the photoluminescence quantum
yield (QY) is commonly used, given by the ratio of the number of emitted and
absorbed photons, where the latter can be determined by subtraction of the
transmitted signal by the sample and by a blank reference. In this work, we
show that when the measurement uncertainty is larger than 10% of the
absorptance of the sample, the QY distribution function becomes skewed, which
can result in underestimated QY values by more than 200%. We demonstrate this
effect in great detail by simulation of the QY methodology that implements an
integrating sphere, which is widely used commercially and for research. Based
on our simulations, we show that this effect arises from the non-linear
propagation of the measurement uncertainties. The observed effect applies to
the measurement of any variable defined as Z=X/Y, with Y=U-V, where X, U and V
are random, normally distributed parameters. For this general case, we derive
the analytical expression and quantify the range in which the effect can be
avoided.

$^{163}$Ho relies on a precise understanding of the deexcitation of a core hole
after an electron capture event. We here present an \textit{ab intio}
calculation of the electron capture spectrum in $^{163}$Ho, including all
intra-atomic decay channels into bound-states. We use theoretical methods
developed for the calculation of core level spectroscopy on correlated electron
compounds. Our comparison critically tests the reality of these theories. We
find that relativistic interactions beyond the Dirac equation, i.e.
quantum-electro dynamics, only lead to minor shifts of the spectral peaks. The
electronic relaxation after an electron capture event due to the changed
nuclear potential leads to a mixing of different edges, but due to conservation
of angular momentum of each scattered electron, no additional structures
emerge. Many-body Coulomb interactions lead to the formation of multiplets and
to additional peaks with multiple core-holes due to Auger decay. Multiplets
crucially change the appearance of the resonances on a Rydberg energy scale.
The additional structures due to Auger decay are, although clearly visible,
relatively weak compared to the one core hole states and accidentally far away
from the end-point region of the spectrum. As the end-point of the spectrum is
effected most by the neutrino mass these additional states do not influence the
statistics for determining the neutrino mass directly. The multiplet broadening
and Auger shake-up of the main core-level edges do change the apparent
line-width and accompanying lifetime of these edges, thereby invalidating
experimentally obtained lifetimes at the resonance for regions far away from
the resonance.
