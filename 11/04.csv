which the emitting tracers reside. In this work, we focus on modelling the CO
emission from simulated giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and study the variations
in the resulting line ratios arising from the emission from the $J=1-0$,
$J=2-1$ and $J=3-2$ transitions. We perform a set of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with time-dependent chemistry, in which
environmental conditions -- including total cloud mass, density, size, velocity
dispersion, metallicity, interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and the cosmic ray
ionisation rate (CRIR) -- were systematically varied. The simulations were then
post-processed using radiative transfer to produce synthetic emission maps in
the 3 transitions quoted above. We find that the cloud-averaged values of the
line ratios can vary by up to $\pm 0.3$ dex, triggered by changes in the
environmental conditions. Changes in the ISRF and/or in the CRIR have the
largest impact on line ratios since they directly affect the abundance,
temperature and distribution of CO-rich gas within the clouds. We show that the
standard methods used to convert CO emission to H$_2$ column density can
underestimate the total H$_2$ molecular gas in GMCs by factors of 2 or 3,
depending on the environmental conditions in the clouds.

time-reversal symmetry, ranging from Onsager's results to fluctuation relations
in counting statistics. In this paper, we show that a recently discovered
duality relation for fermionic systems -- deriving from the fundamental
fermion-parity superselection principle of quantum many-particle systems --
provides new insights into thermoelectric transport. Using a master equation,
we analyze the stationary charge and heat currents through a weakly coupled,
but strongly interacting single-level quantum dot subject to electrical and
thermal bias. In linear transport, the fermion-parity duality shows that
features of thermoelectric response coefficients are actually dominated by the
average and fluctuations of the charge in a dual quantum dot system, governed
by attractive instead of repulsive electron-electron interaction. In the
nonlinear regime, the duality furthermore relates most transport coefficients
to much better understood equilibrium quantities. Finally, we naturally
identify the fermion-parity as the part of the Coulomb interaction relevant for
both the linear and nonlinear Fourier heat. Altogether, our findings hence
reveal that next to time-reversal, the duality imposes equally important
symmetry restrictions on thermoelectric transport. As such, it is also expected
to simplify computations and clarify the physical understanding for more
complex systems than the simplest relevant interacting nanostructure model
studied here.

multidisciplinary team. The prototype was developed in 3 phases. In phase 1,
the context was studied with 2 systematic reviews of the state of practice and
consulting with 3 specialists in Oncology, resulting in a global use case and
main requirements. In phase 2, the needs and barriers of the users were studied
based on literature research and validated with 3 specialists, resulting in the
creation of 3 personas. In phase 3, 2 sessions were held to ideate and
prioritize possible app features, based on brainstorming and selection
techniques. Using the Ninja Mock and Proto.io software a low-fidelity prototype
was developed, resulting in 25 interactive screens. Understanding the user
needs and context seems to be essential to highlight key goals, hence
facilitating the bridge between ideation of the tool and the intended users

Second, the running time cost is increased intolerablely in drawing large-

scintillation photons from liquid argon into visible-spectrum photons to which
the cryogenic phototubes are sensitive. The GQE is the convolution of the
efficiency of the plates that convert the 128 nm scintillation light from
liquid argon to visible light, the efficiency of the shifted light to reach the
photocathode, and the efficiency of the cryogenic photomultiplier tube. We
develop a GEANT4-based model of the optical unit, based on first principles,

photoelectrons ($N_{\rm PE}$) given the known systematic errors on the
simulation parameters. We compare results from four measurements of the $N_{\rm

measured the radial dependence of the quantum efficiency, and find that this
has the same shape as predicted by our model. Our model results in a GQE of

components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block
may be any neural network - for example a fully-connected or a convolutional
layer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function
block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively,
terminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing
network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We
employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to
jointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model against
cross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the
MNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate a
significant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence. In addition,
routing networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch
networks scale linearly with the number of tasks. On CIFAR-100 (20 tasks) we
obtain cross-stitch performance levels with an 85% reduction in training time.

characteristics is one of the most important tasks in microbiome studies. Most
of the existing methods apply univariate models to single microbial species
separately, with adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing. We propose a
Bayesian analysis for a generalized mixed effects linear model tailored to this
application. The marginal prior on each microbial composition is a Dirichlet
Process, and dependence across compositions is induced through a linear
combination of individual covariates, such as disease biomarkers or the
subject's age, and latent factors. The latent factors capture residual
variability and their dimensionality is learned from the data in a fully
Bayesian procedure. The proposed model is tested in data analyses and
simulation studies with zero-inflated compositions. In these settings, within
each sample, a large proportion of counts per microbial species are equal to
zero. In our Bayesian model a priori the probability of compositions with
absent microbial species is strictly positive. We propose an efficient
algorithm to sample from the posterior and visualizations of model parameters
which reveal associations between covariates and microbial compositions. We
evaluate the proposed method in simulation studies, and then analyze a
microbiome dataset for infants with type 1 diabetes which contains a large
proportion of zeros in the sample-specific microbial compositions.

addressed with regard to parametric uncertainties, and an adaptive-robust

presented. TARC approximates the unknown dynamics through the time-delayed
estimation, and the adaptive-robust control provides robustness against the
approximation error. The novel adaptation law of TARC, in contrast to the
conventional adaptive-robust control methodologies, requires neither complete
model of the system nor any knowledge of predefined uncertainty bounds to
compute the switching gain, and circumvents the over- and underestimation
problems of the switching gain. Moreover, TARC only utilizes position feedback
and approximates the velocity and acceleration terms from the past position

explicit requirement of external low pass filters for the removal of

considering the time delay, adaptive law, and state-derivatives estimation

  The first of these results implies that the Legitimate Deck Problem (from the

Reconstruction Conjecture holds in which the number of nonisomorphic preimages
is assumed merely to be polynomially bounded. This strengthens the 1992 result

also holds for WPP, and also holds even when one allows both the rejection- and
acceptance- gap-value targets to simultaneously be polynomial-sized lists; yet
on the other hand, we show that for the #P-based analog of LWPP the behavior
much differs in that, in some relativized worlds, even two target values
already yield a richer class than one value does. Despite that nonrobustness

pressure stripping (RPS) has been extensively studied in numerous simulations.
Nevertheless, the role of magnetic fields (MF) on the gas dynamics in this
process has been hardly studied, although the MF influence on the large-scale
disk structure is well established. With this in mind, we present a 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of face-on RPS of a disk galaxy to study
the impact of the galactic MF in the gas stripping. The main effect of
including a galactic MF is a flared disk. When the intracluster medium (ICM)
wind hits this flared disk, oblique shocks are produced at the interaction
interface, where the ISM is compressed, generating a gas inflow from large
radii towards the central regions of the galaxy. This inflow is observed for
$\sim 150$ Myr and may supply the central parts of the galaxy with material for
star formation while the outskirts of the disk are being stripped of gas, thus
the oblique shocks can induce and enhance the star formation in the remaining
disk. We also observed that the MF alters the shape and structure of the swept
gas, giving a smooth appearance in the magnetized case and clumpier and
filamentary-like morphology in the hydro case. Finally, we estimated the
truncation radius expected for our models using the Gunn-Gott criterion and
found that is in agreement with the simulations.

changes the value at the right time, the privileged operation becomes
inconsistent, leading to a change in control flow, and thus an escalation of
privileges for the attacker. More severely, such double-fetch bugs can be
introduced by the compiler, entirely invisible on the source-code level.
  We propose novel techniques to efficiently detect, exploit, and eliminate
double-fetch bugs. We demonstrate the first combination of state-of-the-art
cache attacks with kernel-fuzzing techniques to allow fully automated
identification of double fetches. We demonstrate the first fully automated
reliable detection and exploitation of double-fetch bugs, making manual

an exploitation success rate of up to 97%. Our modified fuzzer automatically
detects double fetches and automatically narrows down this candidate set for
double-fetch bugs to the exploitable ones. We present the first generic

The CEM allows calculations of the baryon number susceptibilities $\chi_k^B$ to

the baryon fluctuation measures $\chi_2^B$, $\chi_4^B$, $\chi_6^B$ and predict
higher order susceptibilities, that are not yet available from Lattice QCD. The
calculated susceptibilities are then used to extract the radius of convergence
of the Taylor expansion of the pressure. The commonly used ratio test fails due
to the non-trivial asymptotic behavior of the Taylor coefficients. At the same
time, a more elaborate estimator provides finite convergence radii at all
temperatures and in agreement with the singularities of Pad\'e approximants.
The associated singularities lie in the complex $\mu_B/T$-plane and appear
smoothly connected to the Roberge-Weiss transition at high temperatures and

applications in algorithm design, machine learning, data mining, and analysis
of social networks. Over the past decades, researchers have proposed a number
of algorithmic design methods for graph clustering. Most of these methods,
however, are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation,
and cannot be directly applied for clustering many networks that occur in
practice, whose information is often collected on different sites. Designing a
simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great interest, and has wide
applications for processing big datasets.
  In this paper we present a simple and distributed algorithm for graph
clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are characterised by a strong
cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a poly-logarithmic number of
rounds, and recovers a partition of the graph close to optimal. One of the main
components behind our algorithm is a sampling scheme that, given a dense graph
as input, produces a sparse subgraph that provably preserves the
cluster-structure of the input. Compared with previous sparsification
algorithms that require Laplacian solvers or involve combinatorial
constructions, this component is easy to implement in a distributed way and
runs fast in practice.

low-mass stars $(0.1$-$2.5\,M_{\odot})$ at a median stellar age of $1$-$3$ Myr.
Thirteen sources were detected in the 1.3 mm dust continuum with inferred dust
masses of ${\approx} 10$-$260\,M_{\oplus}$ and an upper limit to the median
dust mass of $5.1_{-4.3}^{+6.1}\,M_{\oplus}$, derived using survival analysis.
Comparing the protoplanetary disk population in Serpens to those of other
nearby star-forming regions, we find that the populations of dust disks in
Serpens and Taurus, which have a similar age, are statistically
indistinguishable. This is potentially surprising since Serpens has a stellar
surface density two orders of magnitude in excess of Taurus. Hence, we find no
evidence that dust disks in Serpens have been dispersed as a result of more
frequent and/or stronger tidal interactions due its elevated stellar density.
We also report that the fraction of Serpens disks with $M_{\rm{dust}} \geq
10\,M_{\oplus}$ is less than 20%, which supports the notion that the formation
of giant planets is likely inherently rare or has substantially progressed by a
few Myrs.

many of these candidates have been previously validated by others, the

VLTI/MIDI to resolve the mid-IR nucleus of IC 3639. The origin of the nuclear
infrared emission is determined from: 1) the comparison of the correlated
fluxes from VLTI/MIDI with the fluxes measured at subarcsec resolution
(VLT/VISIR, VLT/ISAAC); 2) diagnostics based on IR fine-structure line ratios,
the IR continuum emission, IR bands produced by polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAH) and silicates; and 3) the high-angular resolution spectral
energy distribution. Results: The unresolved flux of IC 3639 is $90 \pm 20\,
\rm{mJy}$ at $10.5\, \rm{\mu m}$, measured with three different baselines in
VLTI (UT1-UT2, UT3-UT4, and UT2-UT3; $46$-$58\, \rm{m}$), making this the
faintest measurement so far achieved with mid-IR interferometry. The correlated
flux is a factor of $3$-$4$ times fainter than the VLT/VISIR total flux
measurement. The observations suggest that most of the mid-IR emission has its
origin on spatial scales between $10$ and $80\, \rm{pc}$ ($40$-$340\,
\rm{mas}$). A composite scenario where the star formation component dominates
over the AGN is favoured by the diagnostics based on ratios of IR
fine-structure emission lines, the shape of the IR continuum, and the PAH and
silicate bands. Conclusions: A composite AGN-starburst scenario is able to
explain both the mid-IR brightness distribution and the IR spectral properties
observed in the nucleus of IC 3639. The nuclear starburst would dominate the
mid-IR emission and the ionisation of low-excitation lines (e.g. [NeII]$_{12.8
\rm{\mu m}}$) with a net contribution of $\sim 70\%$. The AGN accounts for the
remaining $\sim 30\%$ of the mid-IR flux, ascribed to the unresolved component
in the MIDI observations, and the ionisation of high-excitation lines (e.g.
[NeV]$_{14.3 \rm{\mu m}}$ and [OIV]$_{25.9 \rm{\mu m}}$).

in these environments are likely to have experienced perturbations from
encounters with other stars. We carry out direct $N$-body simulations of
multi-planet systems in star clusters to study the combined effects of stellar
encounters and internal planetary dynamics. These planetary systems eventually
become part of the Galactic field population the parental cluster dissolves,
which is where most presently-known exoplanets are observed. We show that
perturbations induced by stellar encounters lead to distinct signatures in the
field planetary systems, most prominently, the excited orbital inclinations and
eccentricities. Planetary systems that form within the cluster's half-mass
radius are more prone to such perturbations. The orbital elements are most
strongly excited in the outermost orbit, but the effect propagates to the
entire planetary system through secular evolution. Planet ejections may occur
long after a stellar encounter. The surviving planets in these reduced systems
tend to have, on average, higher inclinations and larger eccentricities
compared to systems that were perturbed less strongly. As soon as the parental
star cluster dissolves, external perturbations stop affecting the escaped
planetary systems, and further evolution proceeds on a relaxation time scale.
The outer regions of these ejected planetary systems tend to relax so slowly
that their state carries the memory of their last strong encounter in the star
cluster. Regardless of the stellar density, we observe a robust anticorrelation
between multiplicity and mean inclination/eccentricity. We speculate that the
""Kepler dichotomy"" observed in field planetary systems is a natural consequence
of their early evolution in the parental cluster.

the parameters of the physical model used in the fit (e.g., the mass ratio of

formalism in a cylinder of finite radius. At this finite boundary, a counter
term is introduced that couples the gravitational field in the interior to a
two-dimensional conformal field theory for an SU(2) boundary spinor, whose norm
determines the conformal factor between the fiducial boundary metric and the
physical metric in the bulk. The equations of motion for this boundary spinor
are derived from the boundary action and turn out to be the two-dimensional
analogue of the Witten equations appearing in Witten's proof of the positive
mass theorem. The paper concludes with some comments on the resulting quantum
theory. It is shown, in particular, that the length of a one-dimensional cross
section of the boundary turns into a number operator on the Fock space of the
theory. The spectrum of this operator is discrete and matches the results from
loop quantum gravity in the spin network representation.

physics and chemistry of distant worlds. The effects of opacity sources and
many physical processes combine to set the shape of a transit spectrum. Two
such key processes - refraction and cloud and/or haze forward scattering - have
seen substantial recent study. However, models of these processes are typically
complex, which prevents their incorporation into observational analyses and
standard transit spectrum tools. In this work, we develop analytic expressions
that allow for the efficient parameterization of forward scattering and
refraction effects in transit spectra. We derive an effective slant optical
depth that includes a correction for forward scattered light, and present an
analytic form of this correction. We validate our correction against a
full-physics transit spectrum model that includes scattering, and we explore
the extent to which the omission of forward scattering effects may bias models.
Also, we verify a common analytic expression for the location of a refractive
boundary, which we express in terms of the maximum pressure probed in a transit
spectrum. This expression is designed to be easily incorporated into existing
tools, and we discuss how the detection of a refractive boundary could help
indicate the background atmospheric composition by constraining the bulk
refractivity of the atmosphere. Finally, we show that opacity from Rayleigh
scattering and collision induced absorption will outweigh the effects of
refraction for Jupiter-like atmospheres whose equilibrium temperatures are
above 400-500 K.

of units within the same cluster. Previous literature has defined average
potential outcomes under counterfactual scenarios where treatments are randomly
allocated to units within a cluster. However, within clusters there may be
units that are more or less likely to receive treatment based on covariates or
neighbors' treatment. We define new estimands that describe average potential
outcomes for realistic counterfactual treatment allocation programs, extending
existing estimands to take into consideration the units' covariates and
dependence between units' treatment assignment. We further propose entirely new

interferometry (VLBI) can greatly enhance angular resolution in radio
astronomy. However, at any given moment, a VLBI array only sparsely samples the
information necessary to form an image. Conventional imaging techniques
partially overcome this limitation by making the assumption that the observed
cosmic source structure does not evolve over the duration of an observation,
which enables VLBI networks to accumulate information as the Earth rotates and
changes the projected array geometry. Although this assumption is appropriate
for nearly all VLBI, it is almost certainly violated for submillimeter
observations of the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*
(Sgr A*), which has a gravitational timescale of only ~20 seconds and exhibits
intra-hour variability. To address this challenge, we develop several
techniques to reconstruct dynamical images (""movies"") from interferometric
data. Our techniques are applicable to both single-epoch and multi-epoch
variability studies, and they are suitable for exploring many different
physical processes including flaring regions, stable images with small
time-dependent perturbations, steady accretion dynamics, or kinematics of
relativistic jets. Moreover, dynamical imaging can be used to estimate
time-averaged images from time-variable data, eliminating many spurious image
artifacts that arise when using standard imaging methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our techniques using synthetic observations of simulated black
hole systems and 7mm Very Long Baseline Array observations of M87, and we show
that dynamical imaging is feasible for Event Horizon Telescope observations of

propose a novel technique to filter out chaotic activities from event logs. We
evaluate this technique on a collection of seventeen real-life event logs that

related to the linear-in-$\mathbf{q}$ spatial dispersion of the optical
conductivity tensor, and can be calculated within the formalism of the
semiclassical kinetic equation. Therefore, we calculate the dispersion of
optical conductivity up to the linear order of the wave vector, in the low

In this result, the static and dynamic chiral magnetic effects are revealed to

the other has a geometric origin, which is determined by the orbital magnetic

dynamic chiral magnetic effect. We develop an effective medium theory for

Measurements of these motions have been critical in estimating the turbulent
diffusion coefficient in flux-transport dynamo models and in determining the
Alfven wave excitation spectrum for coronal heating models. We examine the
motions of internetwork flux elements in a 24 hour long Hinode/NFI magnetogram
sequence with 90 second cadence, and study both the scaling of their mean
squared displacement and the shape of their displacement probability
distribution as a function of time. We find that the mean squared displacement
scales super-diffusively with a slope of about 1.48. Super-diffusive scaling
has been observed in other studies for temporal increments as small as 5
seconds, increments over which ballistic scaling would be expected. Using
high-cadence MURaM simulations, we show that the observed super-diffusive
scaling at short temporal increments is a consequence of random changes in the
barycenter positions due to flux evolution. We also find that for long temporal
increments, beyond granular lifetimes, the observed displacement distribution
deviates from that expected for a diffusive process, evolving from Rayleigh to
Gaussian. This change in the distribution can be modeled analytically by
accounting for supergranular advection along with motions due to granulation.
These results complicate the interpretation of magnetic element motions as
strictly advective or diffusive on short and long timescales and suggest that
measurements of magnetic element motions must be used with caution in turbulent
diffusion or wave excitation models. We propose that passive trace motions in
measured photospheric flows may yield more robust transport statistics.

general form, this problem can be cast as a Bayesian estimation problem where
every multipath component is accounted for. However, when the environment map
is unknown, this problem is ill-posed and hence, a tractable approximation is
derived where only direct paths are accounted for. In particular, we take into
account the correlated blocking by scatterers in the environment which appears
as a prior term in the Bayesian estimation framework. A sub-optimal
polynomial-time algorithm to solve the Bayesian multi-target localization
problem with correlated blocking is proposed and its performance is evaluated
using simulations. We found that when correlated blocking is severe, assuming
the blocking events to be independent and having constant probability (as was
done in previous papers) resulted in poor detection performance, with false
alarms more likely to occur than detections.

typical approach to solve QEP and PEP is to use a linearization method to
reformulate the problem as a higher dimensional linear eigenvalue problem. In
this article, we use homotopy continuation to solve these nonlinear eigenvalue
problems without passing to higher dimensions. Our main contribution is to show
that our method produces substantially more accurate results, and finds all

explain the superior accuracy, we show that the nonlinear eigenvalue problem we

and our homotopy continuation algorithm is more stable than QZ algorithm -
theoretical findings that are borne out by our numerical experiments. Our
studies provide yet another illustration of the dictum in numerical analysis
that, for reasons of conditioning and stability, it is sometimes better to
solve a nonlinear problem directly even when it could be transformed into a

series of events originally demonstrated in 1902. A single event is studied
using a two degree of freedom mathematical model of a motor with imbalance
mounted to laterally restricted spring connected cart. For a certain power
supplied, in general the motor rotates at a speed consistent with a motor on a
rigid base. However at speeds close to the natural frequency of the cart, it
seemingly takes on extra oscillations where for a single rotation it both
speeds up and then slows down. Therefore in a standard experimental
demonstration of the effect, as the supplied torque force is increased or
decreased, this may give the illusion that the stable operation of the motor is
losing and gaining stability. This is not strictly the case, instead small
oscillations always present in the system solution are amplified near the
resonant frequency. The imbalance in the motor causes a single resonance curve
to fold back on itself forming two fold bifurcations which leads to hysteresis
and an asymmetry between increasing and decreasing the motor speed. Although as
outlined the basic mechanism is due the interplay between two stable and one
unstable limit cycles, a more complicated bifurcation scenario is observed for
higher imbalances in the motor. The presence of a Z2 phase space symmetry
tempers the dynamics and bifurcation picture.

as single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are embedded as the inductive (L) component
in resonant inductor/capacitor (LC) circuits coupled to a microwave
transmission line. The capacitors are low loss commercial chip capacitors and
limit the internal quality factor of the resonators to approximately $Q_i =
170$. The resonator quality factor, $Q_r \simeq 23$, is dominated by the
coupling to the feedline and limits the detection bandwidth to on the order of
1MHz. When operated in KID mode, the detectors are AC biased with tones at
their resonant frequencies of 45.85 and 91.81MHz. In the low-bias, standard KID
mode, a single photon produces a hot spot that does not turn an entire section
of the line normal but only increases the kinetic inductance. In the high-bias,
critical KID mode, a photon event turns a section of the line normal and the
resonance is destroyed until the normal region is dissipated. When operated as
an SPD in Geiger mode, the resonators are DC biased through cryogenic bias tees
and each photon produces a sharp voltage step followed by a ringdown signal at
the resonant frequency of the detector which is converted to a standard pulse
with an envelop detector. We show that AC biasing in the critical KID mode is
inferior to the sensitivity achieved in DC-biased SPD mode due to the small
fraction of time spent near the critical current with an AC bias.

expediting the deployment of its applications and services. In particular, the
functionality of the IoT devices is extremely dependent on the reliability of
their message transmission. Cyber attacks such as data injection,
eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle threats can lead to security challenges.
Securing IoT devices against such attacks requires accounting for their
stringent computational power and need for low-latency operations. In this
paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic watermarking of IoT
signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a
long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices to extract a
set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically
watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT's cloud
center, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively
authenticate the reliability of the signals. Furthermore, the proposed method
prevents complicated attack scenarios such as eavesdropping in which the cyber
attacker collects the data from the IoT devices and aims to break the
watermarking algorithm. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection
delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from IoT devices with
an almost 100% reliability.

Our goals are to perform a spectrophotometric study of the B star population in
open clusters to derive accurate stellar parameters, search for the presence of
circumstellar envelopes, and discuss the characteristics of these stars.
Methods. The BCD spectrophotometric system is a powerful tool to obtain
fundamental parameters and infer the main properties of open clusters: distance
modulus, color excess, and age. We inspected the Balmer discontinuity to seek
circumstellar disks and identify Be-star candidates. High resolution spectra in
the H$\alpha$ region are used to confirm the Be nature. Results. We provide
Teff , log g, Mv , Mbol and spectral types for a sample of 68 stars in the
field of the open clusters NGC 6087, NGC 6250, NGC 6383, and NGC 6530, as well
as the cluster distances, ages and reddening. Then, based on a sample of 230 B
stars in the direction of the 11 open clusters studied along this series of
three papers, we report 6 new Be stars, 4 blue straggler candidates, and 15
B-type stars (called Bdd) with a double Balmer discontinuity. We also find that
the majority of the Be stars are dwarfs and present a maximum at the spectral
type B2-B4 in young and intermediate-age open clusters. Another maximum of Be
stars is observed at the spectral type B6-B8 in open clusters older than 40
Myr, where the population of Bdd stars also becomes relevant. Conclusions. Our
results support previous statements that the Be phenomenon is present along the
whole main sequence band and occurs in very different evolutionary states. We
find clear evidence of an increase of stars with circumstellar envelopes with
cluster age. The Be phenomenon reaches its maximum in clusters of intermediate
age and the number of B stars with circumstellar envelopes (Be+Bdd stars) is
also high for the older clusters.

features in the data to maximize the number of useful discoveries while
controlling for false positives. We address this problem in the context of
multiple hypotheses testing, where for each hypothesis, we observe a p-value
along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. For example, in
genetic association studies, each hypothesis tests the correlation between a
variant and the trait. We have a rich set of features for each variant (e.g.
its location, conservation, epigenetics etc.) which could inform how likely the
variant is to have a true association. However popular testing approaches, such
as Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure (BH) and independent hypothesis weighting
(IHW), either ignore these features or assume that the features are categorical

learns a discovery threshold as a function of all the hypothesis features. We
parametrize the discovery threshold as a neural network, which enables flexible

efficient end-to-end optimization. We prove that NeuralFDR has strong false

is stably causal except for the blocks that contain the ring singularity. The
latter are vicious sets: any two events within such block can be connected by a
future (respectively past) directed timelike curve. This behavior is identical
to the causal behavior of the Boyer-Lindquist blocks that contains the Kerr
ring singularity which are also vicious sets. On the other hand, while for the
case of a naked Kerr singularity the entire spacetime is a vicious set and thus
closed timelike curves pass through any event including events lying in the
asymptotic region, for the case of a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime the cosmological
horizons imply that the asymptotic de Sitter region is causally well behaved.
In that regard a positive cosmological constant appears to improve the causal
behavior of the underlying spacetime.

continuously rotating half-wave plate. The effect was identified with the data
from the E and B Experiment (EBEX), which was a balloon-borne instrument
designed to measure the polarization of the CMB as well as that from Galactic
dust. The data show polarization fraction larger than 10\% while less than 3\%
were expected from instrumental polarization. We give evidence that the excess
polarization is due to detector non-linearity in the presence of a continuously
rotating HWP. The non-linearity couples intensity signals into polarization. We
develop a map-based method to remove the excess polarization. Applying this
method for the 150 (250) GHz bands data we find that 81\% (92\%) of the excess
polarization was removed. Characterization and mitigation of this effect is
important for future experiments aiming to measure the CMB B-modes with a
continuously rotating HWP.

  Models for Stellar Activity","37 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.EP stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for
detecting exoplanets. It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced
by the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity
along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star.
Low-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities
of 1 m/s or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host
star, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.
However, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,
convective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial
velocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably
detect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial
velocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et
al. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture
time series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar
activity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension
reduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity
indicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger
class of models and use a power-based model comparison procedure to select the
best model. Despite significant interest in exoplanets, previous efforts have
not performed large-scale stellar activity model selection or attempted to
evaluate models based on planet detection power. In the case of main sequence
G2V stars, we find that our method substantially improves planet detection
power compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

compressional boundaries are found at the edges of both types of foreshock. We

of the isochoric-volumetric additive split of free energies in nonlinear
continuum mechanics. The variational multiscale analysis is performed for the
continuum model to construct a foundation for numerical discretization. We
first consider the continuum body instantiated as a hyperelastic material and
develop a variational multiscale formulation for the hyper-elastodynamic

segregated algorithm for the nonlinear solver is designed and carefully

  The natural LP relaxation for the $k$-median/$k$-means with outliers problem
has an unbounded integrality gap. In spite of this negative result, our
iterative rounding framework shows that we can round an LP solution to an
almost-integral solution of small cost, in which we have at most two
fractionally open facilities. Thus, the LP integrality gap arises due to the
gap between almost-integral and fully-integral solutions. Then, using a
pre-processing procedure, we show how to convert an almost-integral solution to
a fully-integral solution losing only a constant-factor in the approximation
ratio. By further using a sparsification technique, the additive factor loss
incurred by the conversion can be reduced to any $\epsilon > 0$.

coefficients. By investigating the vortex dynamics and the sound wave
propagation in terms of these field components, we confirm the validity of the

accurately at smaller times, but it fails to predict characteristic patterns of
molecular origin visible in the longitudinal velocity field. Based on these

The assumption that the velocity autocorrelation function can be expressed in
terms of the fluid velocity field and the tagged particle distribution is found
to be remarkably accurate even for times comparable to or smaller than the mean

Our results are enabled by analyzing a new online learning setting with
outcome-based feedback, which generalizes learning with feedback graphs. We
provide an online learning algorithm for this setting, of independent interest,
with regret that grows only logarithmically with the number of actions and
linearly only in the number of potential outcomes (the latter being very small
in most auction settings). Last but not least, we show that our algorithm
outperforms the bandit approach experimentally and that this performance is
robust to dropping some of our theoretical assumptions or introducing noise in

paradigm gives rise to codes that not only approach the Shannon limit but do so
under the best possible scaling of their block length as a~function of the gap
to capacity. This result exhibits the first known family of binary codes that
attain both optimal scaling and quasi-linear complexity of encoding and
decoding. Our proof is based on the construction and analysis of binary polar
codes with large kernels. When communicating reliably at rates within
$\varepsilon > 0$ of capacity, the code length $n$ often scales as
$O(1/\varepsilon^{\mu})$, where the constant $\mu$ is called the scaling
exponent. It is known that the optimal scaling exponent is $\mu=2$, and it is
achieved by random linear codes. The scaling exponent of conventional polar
codes (based on the $2\times 2$ kernel) on the BEC is $\mu=3.63$. This falls
far short of the optimal scaling guaranteed by random codes. Our main
contribution is a rigorous proof of the following result: for the BEC, there
exist $\ell\times\ell$ binary kernels, such that polar codes constructed from
these kernels achieve scaling exponent $\mu(\ell)$ that tends to the optimal
value of $2$ as $\ell$ grows. We furthermore characterize precisely how large
$\ell$ needs to be as a function of the gap between $\mu(\ell)$ and $2$. The
resulting binary codes maintain the recursive structure of conventional polar
codes, and thereby achieve construction complexity $O(n)$ and encoding/decoding
complexity $O(n\log n)$.

Although the survey will avoid low ecliptic latitudes, the survey pattern in
repeated sequences of four broad-band filters seems well-adapted to Solar
System objects (SSOs) detection and characterization. We aim at evaluating
Euclid capability to discover SSOs, and measure their position, apparent
magnitude, and SED. Also, we investigate how these measurements can lead to the
determination of their orbits, morphology, physical properties, and surface
composition. We use current census of SSOs to estimate the number of SSOs
detectable by Euclid. Then we estimate how Euclid will constrain the SSOs
dynamical, physical, and compositional properties. With current survey design,
about 150,000 SSOs, mainly from the asteroid main-belt, should be observed by
Euclid. These objects will all have high inclination. There is a potential for
discovery of several 10,000 SSOs, in particular KBOs at high declination.
Euclid observations will refine the spectral classification of SSOs by
extending the spectral coverage provided by, e.g. Gaia and the LSST to 2
microns. The time-resolved photometry, combined with sparse photometry will
contribute to the determination of SSO rotation period, spin orientation, and
shape model. The sharp and stable point-spread function of Euclid will also
allow to resolve KBO binary systems and detect activity around Centaurs. The
depth of Euclid survey, its spectral coverage, and observation cadence has
great potential for Solar System research. A dedicated processing for SSOs is
being set in place to produce catalogs of astrometry, multi-color and

the average mass of ejected material from nearby stars during the process of

including a broad Fe K$\alpha$ line and a Compton hump peaking around 30 keV.
Detailed spectral modeling reveals narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line complex centered
around 6.5 keV on top of the strong relativistically broadened Fe K$\alpha$
line. The narrow component is consistent with distant reflection from
moderately ionized material. The spectral continuum is well described by a
combination of cool thermal disk photons and a Comptonized plasma with the
electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}=19.7\pm{0.4}$ keV. An adequate fit can be
achieved for the disk reflection features with a self-consistent relativistic
reflection model that assumes a lamp-post geometry for the coronal illuminating
source. The spectral fitting measures a black hole spin $a>0.84$, inner disk
radius $R_{\rm in}<2.01~r_{\rm ISCO}$, and a lamp-post height

  For machine learning, especially deep learning, it is often necessary to
compute the gradient of a loss function $l(a,b,c,d)=l(f(a,b,c,d))$ with respect
to parameters $a,b,c,d$. If tensor compilers are to be applied in this field,
it is necessary to derive expressions for the derivatives of element-wise
defined tensors, i.e. expressions for $(da)_{ik}=\partial l/\partial a_{ik}$.
  When the mapping between function indices and argument indices is not 1:1,
special attention is required. For the function $f_{ij} (x) = x_i^2$, the
derivative of the loss is $(dx)_i=\partial l/\partial x_i=\sum_j
(df)_{ij}2x_i$; the sum is necessary because index $j$ does not appear in the
indices of $f$. Another example is $f_{i}(x)=x_{ii}^2$, where $x$ is a matrix;
here we have $(dx)_{ij}=\delta_{ij}(df)_i2x_{ii}$; the Kronecker delta is
necessary because the derivative is zero for off-diagonal elements. Another
indexing scheme is used by $f_{ij}(x)=\exp x_{i+j}$; here the correct
derivative is $(dx)_{k}=\sum_i (df)_{i,k-i} \exp x_{k}$, where the range of the
sum must be chosen appropriately.
  In this publication we present an algorithm that can handle any case in which
the indices of an argument are an arbitrary linear combination of the indices
of the function, thus all the above examples can be handled. Sums (and their
ranges) and Kronecker deltas are automatically inserted into the derivatives as
necessary. Additionally, the indices are transformed, if required (as in the
last example). The algorithm outputs a symbolic expression that can be
subsequently fed into a tensor algebra compiler.

0.1 TeV) $\gamma$-ray source, HESS J1741-302, located in the Galactic plane.
Despite several attempts to constrain its nature, no plausible counterpart has
been found so far at X-ray and MeV/GeV $\gamma$-ray energies, and the source
remains unidentified. An analysis of 145-hour of observations of HESS J1741-302
at VHEs has revealed a steady and relatively weak TeV source ($\sim$1$\%$ of
the Crab Nebula flux), with a spectral index of $\Gamma$ = 2.3 $\pm$
0.2$_{\text{stat}}$ $\pm$ 0.2$_{\text{sys}}$, extending to energies up to 10
TeV without any clear signature of a cut-off. In a hadronic scenario, such a
spectrum implies an object with particle acceleration up to energies of several
hundred TeV. Contrary to most H.E.S.S. unidentified sources, the angular size
of HESS J1741-302 is compatible with the H.E.S.S. point spread function at
VHEs, with an extension constrained to be below 0.068$^{\circ}$ at a 99$\%$
confidence level. The $\gamma$-ray emission detected by H.E.S.S. can be
explained both within a hadronic scenario, due to collisions of protons with
energies of hundreds of TeV with dense molecular clouds, and in a leptonic
scenario, as a relic pulsar wind nebula, possibly powered by the middle-aged
(20 kyr) pulsar PSR B1737-30. A binary scenario, related to the compact radio
source 1LC 358.266+0.038 found to be spatially coincident with the best fit
position of HESS J1741-302, is also envisaged.

considering a Poisson field of ground interferers, we characterize the
aggregate interference experienced by the drone. This result includes the
effect of the drone antenna pattern, the height-dependent shadowing, and
various types of environment. We show that the benefits that a drone obtains
from a better line-of-sight (LoS) at high altitudes is counteracted by a high
vulnerability to the interference coming from the ground. However, by deriving
the link coverage probability and transmission rate we show that a drone base
station is still a promising technology if the overall system is properly
dimensioned according to the given density and transmission power of the
interferers. Particularly, our results illustrate how the benefits of such

controls important heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere and is thought to
have similar physics to anion adsorption at hydrophobic interfaces more
generally. While much theoretical and experimental work over the last 20 years
has made clear that the adsorption of large, polarizable anions is
thermodynamically favorable, determining the role of polarizability in
adsorption has proven surprisingly challenging. Simple physical models make
clear that nonpolarizable anions will not adsorb, but trends in adsorption are
difficult to rationalize based on polarizability and in some theoretical
approaches adsorption is observed without change in anion polarization. Because
there are no experimental studies of interfacial anion polarizability, one
possible explanation of these results is that theoretical descriptions suffer
from systematic error. In this study we use interface specific nonlinear
optical spectroscopy to extract the spectral response of the interfacial
ClO$_{4}^{-}$ anion. We find that (i) the interfacial environment induces a
break in symmetry of the anion due to its solvation anisotropy (ii) the Raman
depolarization ratio, a measure of the ratio of the change in two components of
ClO$_{4}^{-}$'s polarizability tensor with change in nuclear positions, is
$>2\times$ larger than its value in the adjoining bulk phase and interfacial
concentration dependent and (iii) using a simple theoretical description we
find that our measured changes in depolarization ratio are consistent with
known changes in surface potential and tension with small changes in bulk
ClO$_{4}^{-}$ concentration. The notion that interfacial anion polarizability
differs from that in bulk, and that this polarizability is coverage dependent,
is not accounted for in any current theoretical treatment of ions at the
air/water interface.

modeling that reproduces both the equilibrium structures of solitons and their
temporal evolution in applied fields, we uncover the physical underpinnings
behind this reconfigurable motion and study how it depends on the structure and

of astronomical sources with extremely high angular resolution. Most recently,
the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has extended VLBI to short millimeter
wavelengths with a goal of achieving angular resolution sufficient for imaging
the event horizons of nearby supermassive black holes. VLBI provides
measurements related to the underlying source image through a sparse set
spatial frequencies. An image can then be recovered from these measurements by
making assumptions about the underlying image. One of the most important
assumptions made by conventional imaging methods is that over the course of a
night's observation the image is static. However, for quickly evolving sources,
such as the galactic center's supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) targeted by the
EHT, this assumption is violated and these conventional imaging approaches
fail. In this work we propose a new way to model VLBI measurements that allows
us to recover both the appearance and dynamics of an evolving source by
reconstructing a video rather than a static image. By modeling VLBI
measurements using a Gaussian Markov Model, we are able to propagate
information across observations in time to reconstruct a video, while
simultaneously learning about the dynamics of the source's emission region. We
demonstrate our proposed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, StarWarps, on
realistic synthetic observations of black holes, and show how it substantially
improves results compared to conventional imaging algorithms. Additionally, we
demonstrate StarWarps on real VLBI data of the M87 Jet from the VLBA.

transiting super-Earth planets were detected by the K2 mission around the
nearby star GJ 9827/HIP 115752, at only 30 pc away. The radii of the planets
span the ""radius gap""' detected by Fulton et al. (2017), and all orbit within

for orthogonal matrix-valued fields. Following the Ginzburg-Landau approach,
this energy is relaxed by penalizing the matrix-valued field when it does not
take orthogonal matrix values. A generalization of the MBO diffusion generated
motion is introduced that effectively finds local minimizers of this energy by
iterating two steps until convergence. In the first step, as in the original
method, the current matrix-valued field is evolved by the diffusion equation.
In the second step, the field is pointwise reassigned to the closest orthogonal
matrix, which can be computed via the singular value decomposition. We extend
the Lyapunov function of Esedoglu and Otto to show that the method is
non-increasing on iterates and hence, unconditionally stable. We also prove
that spatially discretized iterates converge to a stationary solution in a
finite number of iterations. The algorithm is implemented using the closest
point method and non-uniform fast Fourier transform. We conclude with several
numerical experiments on flat tori and closed surfaces, which, unsurprisingly,
exhibit classical behavior from the Allen-Cahn and complex Ginzburg Landau
equations, but also new phenomena.

range class of constrained convex optimization problems. Our approach mainly
relies on a novel combination of the classical quadratic penalty, alternating
minimization, Nesterov's acceleration, and adaptive strategy for parameters.
The first algorithm is designed to solve generic and possibly nonsmooth
constrained convex problems without requiring any Lipschitz gradient continuity
or strong convexity, while achieving the best-known
$O(\frac{1}{k})$-convergence rate in a non-ergodic sense, where $k$ is the
iteration counter. The second algorithm is also designed to solve non-strongly
convex, but semi-strongly convex problems. This algorithm can achieve the
best-known $O(\frac{1}{k^2})$-convergence rate on the primal constrained
problem. Such a rate is obtained in two cases: (i)~averaging only on the
iterate sequence of the strongly convex term, or (ii) using two proximal
operators of this term without averaging. In both algorithms, we allow one to
linearize the second subproblem to use the proximal operator of the
corresponding objective term. Then, we customize our methods to solve different
convex problems, and lead to new variants. As a byproduct, these algorithms
preserve the same convergence guarantees as in our main algorithms. We verify
our theoretical development via different numerical examples and compare our
methods with some existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

co-saliency detection aims at discovering the common salient objects in

focus on RGB image and ignore the depth information for RGBD images. In this
paper, we propose an iterative RGBD co-saliency framework, which utilizes the
existing single saliency maps as the initialization, and generates the final
RGBD cosaliency map by using a refinement-cycle model. Three schemes are
employed in the proposed RGBD co-saliency framework, which include the addition
scheme, deletion scheme, and iteration scheme. The addition scheme is used to
highlight the salient regions based on intra-image depth propagation and
saliency propagation, while the deletion scheme filters the saliency regions
and removes the non-common salient regions based on interimage constraint. The
iteration scheme is proposed to obtain more homogeneous and consistent
co-saliency map. Furthermore, a novel descriptor, named depth shape prior, is
proposed in the addition scheme to introduce the depth information to enhance
identification of co-salient objects. The proposed method can effectively
exploit any existing 2D saliency model to work well in RGBD co-saliency
scenarios. The experiments on two RGBD cosaliency datasets demonstrate the

accretion of disc material while available. Massive planets clear a gap in
their protoplanetary disc, but can still accrete gas through a circumplanetary
disk. For high enough accretion rates the planet should be detectable at
infrared wavelengths. As the energy of the gas accreted on to the planet is
released, the planet surroundings heat up in a feedback process. We aim to test
how this planet feedback affects the gas in the coorbital region and the
accretion rate itself. We modified the 2D code FARGO-AD to include a
prescription for the accretion and feedback luminosity of the planet and use it
to model giant planets on 10 au circular and eccentric orbits around a solar
mass star. We find that this feedback reduces but does not halt the accretion
on to the planet, although this result might depend on the near-coincident
radial ranges where both recipes are implemented. Our simulations also show
that the planet heating gives the accretion rate a stochastic variability with
an amplitude $\Delta \dot{M}_p \sim 0.1 \dot{M}_p$. A planet on an eccentric
orbit ($e=0.1)$ presents a similar variability amplitude, but concentrated on a
well-defined periodicity of half the orbital period and weaker broadband noise,
potentially allowing observations to discriminate between both cases. Finally,
we find that the heating of the coorbital region by the planet feedback alters
the gas dynamics, reducing the difference between its orbital velocity and the
Keplerian motion at the edge of the gap, which can have important consequences
for the formation of dust rings.

building-like obstacles is an idealized model to study transport of
contaminants in the urban atmospheric boundary layer (UABL). A reasonably
accurate LES prediction of turbulence in such an UABL must resolve a
significant proportion of the small but energetic eddies in the roughness
sublayer, which remains prohibitive even though computational power has been
increased significantly. In this article, we present a large-eddy simulation
methodology to study turbulence in UABLs, where the turbulence closure is based
on coupling the eddy viscosity method with the canopy stress method. Unlike the
classical Smagorinsky model that considers only the strain portion of the
velocity gradient tensor, we consider both the strain tensor and the rotation
tensor to compute the eddy viscosity. This allows us to dynamically adapt the
rate of energy dissipation to the scales of the energetic eddies in the
roughness sublayer. Without employing a mesh conforming to the urban roughness
elements, the effect of such solid bodies are represented in the LES model
through a canopy stress method in which the loss of pressure and the sink of
momentum due to the interaction between eddies and roughness elements are
parameterized using the instantaneous velocity field. Simulation results of the
proposed canopy stress method is compared with that of a conventional
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method employing a block-structured mesh
conforming around the roughness elements. For urban flow simulations, the
results demonstrate that the proposed canopy stress model is accurate in
predicting vertical profiles of mean and variance, as well as the temporal
intermittency of coherent structures.

application, from detecting terrorist cells in counter-terrorism efforts to
phishing attacks in social network circles. For this reason, numerous
techniques for anomaly detection have been introduced. However, application of
these techniques to more complex network models is hindered by various
challenges such as the size of the network being investigated, how much apriori
information is needed, the size of the anomalous graph, among others. A recent
technique introduced by Miller et al, which relies on a spectral framework for
anomaly detection, has the potential to address many of these challenges. In
their discussion of the spectral framework, three algorithms were proposed that
relied on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the residual matrix of a binary
network. The authors demonstrated the ability to detect anomalous subgraphs
that were less than 1% of the network size. However, to date, there is little
work that has been done to evaluate the statistical performance of these
algorithms. This study investigates the statistical properties of the spectral
methods, specifically the Chi-square and L1 norm algorithm proposed by Miller.
We will analyze the performance of the algorithm using simulated networks and
also extend the method's application to count networks. Finally we will make
some methodological improvements and recommendations to both algorithms.

a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb F$. Our algorithm is analogous
to the algorithm of Bodlaender and Kloks (1996) on tree-width of graphs. To
extend their framework to branch-decompositions of vector spaces, we developed
highly generic tools for branch-decompositions on vector spaces. The only known
previous fixed-parameter algorithm for branch-width of $\mathbb F$-represented

where $n$ is the number of elements of the input $\mathbb F$-represented

finite and uses the algorithm of Hlin\v{e}n\'y (2006) on checking monadic
second-order formulas on $\mathbb F$-represented matroids of small
branch-width. Our result does not depend on such a fact and is completely
self-contained, and yet matches their asymptotic running time for each fixed

when quantum gases are confined in a superradiant Fabry-Perot cavity. In
addition to the discoveries of exotic phases, such as density wave ordered Mott
insulator and superfluid, a surprising kink structure is found in the slope of
the cavity strength as a function of the pumping strength. In this Letter, we
show that the appearance of such a kink is a manifestation of a liquid-gas like
transition between two superfluids with different densities. The slopes in the
immediate neighborhood of the kink become divergent at the liquid-gas critical
points and display a critical scaling law with a critical exponent 1 in the
quantum critical region. Our predictions could be tested in current
experimental set-up.

field, which evolves self-consistently, but mainly plays a passive role in the
dynamics. Our numerical results reveal that the signal is steepened into a
shock that propagates upward into the corona. The chromospheric cold and dense
plasma lags behind this shock and rises into the corona with a mean speed of
20-25 km s$^{-1}$. The formed spicule exhibits the upflow/downfall of plasma
during its total lifetime of around 3-4 minutes, and it follows the typical
characteristics of a classical spicule, which is modeled by
magnetohydrodynamics. The simulated spicule consists of a dense and cold core

different widths of both spicules with increasing rarefaction of the ion

information processing tasks. Quantum circuit design automation methods mostly
use a waterfall approach and consider that high level circuit descriptions are
hardware agnostic. This assumption has lead to a static circuit perspective:
the number of quantum bits and quantum gates is determined before circuit
execution and everything is considered reliable with zero probability of
failure. Many different schemes for achieving reliable fault-tolerant quantum
computation exist, with different schemes suitable for different architectures.
A number of large experimental groups are developing architectures well suited
to being protected by surface quantum error correcting codes. Such circuits
could include unreliable logical elements, such as state distillation, whose
failure can be determined only after their actual execution. Therefore,
practical logical circuits, as envisaged by many groups, are likely to have a
dynamic structure. This requires an online scheduling of their execution: one
knows for sure what needs to be executed only after previous elements have
finished executing. This work shows that scheduling shares similarities with
place and route methods. The work also introduces the first online schedulers
of quantum circuits protected by surface codes. The work also highlights
scheduling efficiency by comparing the new methods with state of the art static

complex planning problems, unguided uniform sampling of actions until a path to
a goal is found is hopelessly inefficient, and gradient-based approaches often
fall short when the optimization manifold of a given problem is not smooth. In
this paper we present an approach that guides the search of a state-space
planner, such as A*, by learning an action-sampling distribution that can
generalize across different instances of a planning problem. The motivation is
that, unlike typical learning approaches for planning for continuous action
space that estimate a policy, an estimated action sampler is more robust to
error since it has a planner to fall back on. We use a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN), and address an important issue: search experience consists of a
relatively large number of actions that are not on a solution path and a
relatively small number of actions that actually are on a solution path. We
introduce a new technique, based on an importance-ratio estimation method, for
using samples from a non-target distribution to make GAN learning more
data-efficient. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluation in
three challenging continuous robot planning problems to illustrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

complex exponential functions from compressed non-uniform time-domain samples.
Total Variation (TV) minimization or atomic norm minimization was proposed in
the literature to recover the $R$ frequencies or the missing data. However, it
is known that in order for TV minimization and atomic norm minimization to
recover the missing data or the frequencies, the underlying $R$ frequencies are
required to be well-separated, even when the measurements are noiseless. This
paper shows that the Hankel matrix recovery approach can super-resolve the $R$
complex exponentials and their frequencies from compressed non-uniform
measurements, regardless of how close their frequencies are to each other. We
propose a new concept of orthonormal atomic norm minimization (OANM), and
demonstrate that the success of Hankel matrix recovery in separation-free
super-resolution comes from the fact that the nuclear norm of a Hankel matrix
is an orthonormal atomic norm. More specifically, we show that, in traditional
atomic norm minimization, the underlying parameter values $\textbf{must}$ be
well separated to achieve successful signal recovery, if the atoms are changing
continuously with respect to the continuously-valued parameter. In contrast,
for the OANM, it is possible the OANM is successful even though the original
atoms can be arbitrarily close.
  As a byproduct of this research, we provide one matrix-theoretic inequality
of nuclear norm, and give its proof from the theory of compressed sensing.

rheology of steady two-dimensional granular flows with reference to a
unidirectional shear flow, which has been extensively employed for validating
the local visco-plastic model of Jop et al. [Nature 441, 727--730 (2006)]. The
$\mu$-$I$ scaling proposed by Jop et al. is found to be valid in both
two-dimensional and unidirectional flows, as observed in previous studies,
however, each flow type results in a different curve. Here $\mu$, ratio of the
shear stress magnitude to the pressure, is the friction coefficient and $I$ is
the dimensionless inertial number, which is proportional to the ratio of the
magnitude of the rate of strain tensor, $\dot{\gamma}$, to the square root of
the pressure. The friction coefficient is found not to scale in a simple way
with the flow classification parameter $\psi$, which characterizes the local
flow type. All the data collapse to a single curve using the scaling proposed
by Zhang and Kamrin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 058001 (2017)], in which the scaled
granular fluidity ($f=1/(\mu T)$, where $T \propto u/\dot{\gamma}$ and $u$ is
the fluctuation velocity) is found to depend only on the solid fraction $\phi$.
The data for variation of $\phi$ with inertial number $I$ collapse to a single
curve for all the flows.

explore the evolution mechanisms of scientific coauthorship networks. The model
generates geometric hypergraphs, where the costs are modelled by space
distances, and the benefits are expressed by node reputations, i. e. geometric
zones that depend on node position in space and time. Modelled cooperative
strategies conditioned on positive benefit-minus-cost reflect the spatial
reciprocity principle in collaborations, and generate high clustering and
degree assortativity, two typical features of coauthorship networks. Modelled
reputations generate the generalized Poisson parts and fat tails appeared in
specific distributions of empirical data, e. g. paper team size distribution.
The combined effect of modelled costs and reputations reproduces the
transitions emerged in degree distribution, in the correlation between degree

individual strategies induce network complexity, as well as an application of
game theory to social affiliation networks.

take turns in moving a single queen on a large chessboard, attempting to be the
first to put her in the upper left corner, position $(0,0)$. Instead of the
queen used in Wythoff Nim, we use the generalized Ry\=u\=o for a given natural
number $p$. The generalized Ry\=u\=o for $p$ can be moved horizontally and
vertically, as far as one wants. It also can be moved diagonally from $(x,y)$
to $(x-s,y-t)$, where $s,t$ are non-negative integers such that $1 \leq s \leq
x, 1 \leq t \leq y \textit{and} s+t \leq p-1$. When $p$ is $3$, the generalized
Ry\=u\=o for $p$ is a Ry\=u\=o, i.e., a promoted hisha piece of Japanese chess.
A Ry\=u\=o combines the power of the rook and the king in Western chess. The
generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ is mathematically the same as the Nim with two
piles of counters in which a player may take any number from either heap, and a
player may also simultaneously remove $s$ counters from either of the piles and
$t$ counters from the other, where $s+t \leq p-1$ and $p$ is a given natural
number. The Grundy number of the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ is given by
$\bmod(x+y,p) + p(\lfloor \frac{x}{p} \rfloor \oplus \lfloor
\frac{y}{p}\rfloor)$. The authors also study the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for
$p$ with a pass move. The generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ without a pass move
has simple formulas for Grundy numbers. This is not the case after the
introduction of a pass move, but it still has simple formulas for the previous
player's positions. We also study the Ry\=u\=o Nim that restricted the diagonal
and side movement. Moreover, we extended the Ry\=u\=o Nim dimension to the
$n$-dimension.

attractive possibility as an airborne calibration platform for astronomical
facilities. This is especially true for arrays of telescopes spread over a
large area such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In this paper, the
feasibility of using UAVs to calibrate CTA is investigated. Assuming a UAV at 1
km altitude above CTA, operating on astronomically clear nights with
stratified, low atmospheric dust content, appropriate thermal protection for
the calibration light source and an onboard photodiode to monitor its absolute
light intensity, inter-calibration of CTA's telescopes of the same size class
is found to be achievable with a 6-8 % uncertainty. For cross-calibration of
different telescope size classes, a systematic uncertainty of 8-10 % is found
to be achievable. Importantly, equipping the UAV with a multi-wavelength
calibration light source affords us the ability to monitor the
wavelength-dependent degradation of CTA telescopes' optical system, allowing us
to not only maintain this 6-10 % uncertainty after the first few years of
telescope deployment, but also to accurately account for the effect of
multi-wavelength degradation on the cross-calibration of CTA by other
techniques, namely with images of air showers and local muons. A UAV-based
system thus provides CTA with several independent and complementary methods of
cross-calibrating the optical throughput of individual telescopes. Furthermore,
housing environmental sensors on the UAV system allows us to not only minimise
the systematic uncertainty associated with the atmospheric transmission of the
calibration signal, it also allows us to map the dust content above CTA as well
as monitor the temperature, humidity and pressure profiles of the first
kilometre of atmosphere above CTA with each UAV flight.

attention as there seems to be a relation between the evolution of filaments

by simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies have
analysed the evolution of filaments using numerical simulations where the
filaments form self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the
early evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual clouds. We
focus on three questions: How do the line masses of filaments evolve? How and
when do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line
masses of the filaments? We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in
kpc-scale numerical simulations performed with the FLASH code. We compare the
properties of the identified filaments with the predictions of analytic
filament stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the
identified filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity. The
first fragments appear early when the line masses lie well below the critical
line mass of Ostriker's hydrostatic equilibrium solution. The average line
masses of filaments identified in 3D density cubes increases far more quickly
than those identified in 2D column density maps. Our results suggest that
hydrostatic or dynamic compression from the surrounding cloud has a significant
impact on the early dynamical evolution of filaments. A simple model of an
isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a good approach for fragmentation
analysis. Caution must be exercised in interpreting distributions of properties
of filaments identified in column density maps, especially in the case of
low-mass filaments. Comparing or combining results from studies that use
different filament finding techniques is strongly discouraged.

fluctuations in ongoing and stimulus-evoked population activity in primate

effects tended to have less additive modulation, and vice versa. The
information encoded by multiplicatively-modulated neurons increased with
greater population activity, while that of additively-modulated neurons

innovatively add communication paths among models and design various structures

these two peakon PDEs are generalized to a family of $U(1)$-invariant peakon

Sobolev $H^1(\mathbf{R})$ norm is time invariant). The Hamiltonian structure
for the sector of conservative peakons is identified and the peakon ODEs are
shown to be Hamiltonian with respect to several Poisson structures. It is shown
that the resulting Hamilonian peakon flows in the case of the two peakon
equations derived in [Anco and Mobasheramini, Physica D, 355:1--23, 2017] form
orthogonal families, while in general the Hamiltonian peakon flows for two

The metasurfaces are CMOS compatible and can be fabricated using conventional

up to 95% efficiency for a wide-angle deflection range from 20{\deg} to

supported by 5G networks, especially due to the proliferation of Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC), which has a prominent role in reducing network stress by
shifting computational tasks from the Internet to the mobile edge. Apart from
being part of MEC, D2D can extend cellular coverage allowing users to
communicate directly when telecommunication infrastructure is highly congested
or absent. This significant departure from the typical cellular paradigm
imposes the need for decentralised network routing protocols. Moreover,
enhanced capabilities of mobile devices and D2D networking will likely result
in proliferation of new malware types and epidemics. Although the literature is
rich in terms of D2D routing protocols that enhance quality-of-service and
energy consumption, they provide only basic security support, e.g., in the form
of encryption. Routing decisions can, however, contribute to collaborative
detection of mobile malware by leveraging different kinds of anti-malware
software installed on mobile devices. Benefiting from the cooperative nature of
D2D communications, devices can rely on each other's contributions to detect
malware. The impact of our work is geared towards having more malware-free D2D
networks. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel routing protocol
for D2D communications that optimises routing decisions for explicitly
improving malware detection. The protocol identifies optimal network paths, in
terms of malware mitigation and energy spent for malware detection, based on a
game theoretic model. Diverse capabilities of network devices running different
types of anti-malware software and their potential for inspecting messages
relayed towards an intended destination device are leveraged using game
theoretic tools. An optimality analysis of both Nash and Stackelberg security
games is undertaken, including both zero and non-zero sum variants, and the
Defender's equilibrium strategies. By undertaking network simulations,
theoretical results obtained are illustrated through randomly generated network
scenarios showing how our protocol outperforms conventional routing protocols,
in terms of expected payoff, which consists of: security damage in inflicted by
malware and malware detection cost.

architecture for beam forming and wavefront shaping, with applications that
include satellite and terrestrial communications, radar, imaging, and wireless
power transfer. The metasurface antenna consists of an array of metamaterial
elements distributed over an electrically large structure, each subwavelength
in dimension and with subwavelength separation between elements. In the antenna
configuration we consider here, the metasurface is excited by the fields from
an attached waveguide. Each metamaterial element can be modeled as a
polarizable dipole that couples the waveguide mode to radiation modes. Distinct
from the phased array and electronically scanned antenna (ESA) architectures, a
dynamic metasurface antenna does not require active phase shifters and
amplifiers, but rather achieves reconfigurability by shifting the resonance
frequency of each individual metamaterial element. Here we derive the basic
properties of a one-dimensional waveguide-fed metasurface antenna in the
approximation that the metamaterial elements do not perturb the waveguide mode
and are non-interacting. We derive analytical approximations for the array
factors of the 1D antenna, including the effective polarizabilities needed for
amplitude-only, phase-only, and binary constraints. Using full-wave numerical
simulations, we confirm the analysis, modeling waveguides with slots or
complementary metamaterial elements patterned into one of the surfaces.

we implement a nonlinear focal modulation by applying phase modulations with

employs a spatial light modulator (SLM) for assisting pattern-modulated

exploring a relatively simple and flexible system, the imagingperformance of
NFOMM is comparable with STED as evidenced in imaging nuclear pore complexes,
demonstrating NFOMM is a suitable observation tool for fundamental studies in

triad behaves asymptotically as a couple of radiation perfect fluids whose
energy densities are negative for the $S$ term but positive for the Yang-Mills
term. This leads to an interesting dynamical fine-tuning mechanism that gives
rise to a combined equation of state parameter $\omega \simeq -1$ and,
therefore, to an eternal period of accelerated isotropic expansion for an ample

critical points of the associated dynamical system can describe a prolonged
period of isotropic slow-roll inflation sustained by the $S$ term. This period
ends up when the Yang-Mills term dominates the energy density leading to the

The transient current signal during the motor startup was acquired from a
healthy motor and a faulty motor with a broken rotor bar fault. We extracted 13
statistical time domain features from the startup transient current signal, and
used these features to train and test a random forest to determine whether the
motor was operating under normal or faulty conditions. For feature selection,
we used the feature importances from the random forest to reduce the number of
features to two features. The results showed that the random forest classifies
the motor condition as healthy or faulty with an accuracy of 98.8% using all
features and with an accuracy of 98.4% by using only the mean-index and
impulsion features. The performance of the random forest was compared with a
decision tree, Na\""ive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, linear ridge, and
a support vector machine, with the random forest consistently having a higher
accuracy than the other algorithms. The proposed approach can be used in
industry for online monitoring and fault diagnostic of LS-PMSM motors and the

where a high quality of annotation is often crucial. In this work, we propose
to fine-tune CNNs for image retrieval on a large collection of unordered images

state-of-the-art retrieval and structure-from-motion methods guide the
selection of the training data. We show that both hard-positive and
hard-negative examples, selected by exploiting the geometry and the camera
positions available from the 3D models, enhance the performance of
particular-object retrieval. CNN descriptor whitening discriminatively learned
from the same training data outperforms commonly used PCA whitening. We propose
a novel trainable Generalized-Mean (GeM) pooling layer that generalizes max and
average pooling and show that it boosts retrieval performance. Applying the
proposed method to the VGG network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the

  In this work we study the problem of maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular
continuous functions under general down-closed convex constraints. We start by
investigating geometric properties that underlie such objectives, e.g., a
strong relation between (approximately) stationary points and global optimum is
proved. These properties are then used to devise two optimization algorithms
with provable guarantees. Concretely, we first devise a ""two-phase"" algorithm
with $1/4$ approximation guarantee. This algorithm allows the use of existing
methods for finding (approximately) stationary points as a subroutine, thus,
harnessing recent progress in non-convex optimization. Then we present a
non-monotone Frank-Wolfe variant with $1/e$ approximation guarantee and
sublinear convergence rate. Finally, we extend our approach to a broader class
of generalized DR-submodular continuous functions, which captures a wider
spectrum of applications. Our theoretical findings are validated on synthetic

been accumulated, so it is believed that the time for precisely studying
baryons especially heavy baryons, has come. By analyzing the data, the
quark-diquark structure which has been under intensive discussions, can be
tested. In this work the decay widths of weak transitions $\Sigma_b\to
\Sigma^*_c+X$ are calculated in terms of the light front quark model (LFQM). To
carry out the calculations, the quark-diquark picture is employed where an
axial-vector diquark composed of two light quarks serves as a spectator in the
concerned processes. The first step of this work is to construct the vertex
functions for $\Sigma^{(*)}_c$ and $\Sigma_b$, then the relevant form factors
are derived. It is shown that under the heavy quark limit the Isgur-Wise
functions for the transition are re-deduced. Indeed, how to properly depict the
polarization ($\epsilon_{\mu}$) of the diquark is slightly tricky. In this
work, we apply two schemes to explicitly determine the momentum-dependence of
the diquark. The corresponding numerical results are presented which will be
testified by the future experiments.

matricial upper-half plane over a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$. We define an
$\mathcal{A}$-valued chordal Loewner chain as a subordination chain of analytic
self-maps of the $\mathcal{A}$-valued upper half-plane, such that each $F_t$ is
the reciprocal Cauchy transform of an $\mathcal{A}$-valued law $\mu_t$, such
that the mean and variance of $\mu_t$ are continuous functions of $t$.
  We relate $\mathcal{A}$-valued Loewner chains to processes with
$\mathcal{A}$-valued free or monotone independent independent increments just
as was done in the scalar case by Bauer (""L\""owner's equation from a
non-commutative probability perspective"", J. Theoretical Prob., 2004) and
Schei{\ss}inger (""The Chordal Loewner Equation and Monotone Probability

  We show that the Loewner equation $\partial_t F_t(z) = DF_t(z)[V_t(z)]$, when

Lipschitz mean-zero Loewner chains $F_t$ and vector fields $V_t(z)$ of the form
$V_t(z) = -G_{\nu_t}(z)$ where $\nu_t$ is a generalized $\mathcal{A}$-valued

  Based on the Loewner equation, we derive a combinatorial expression for the
moments of $\mu_t$ in terms of $\nu_t$. We also construct non-commutative
random variables on an operator-valued monotone Fock space which realize the

Motivated from Computer Vision, we propose a two-stage approach. The first
stage trains a deep network that works as feature extractor and in the second
stage, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) are used for classification. The
proposed approach outperforms all previously reported structural and deep
learning based methods with a final accuracy of 83.24% on Tobacco-3482 dataset,
leading to a relative error reduction of 25% when compared to a previous

prediction time for 2,482 images is 3.066 seconds. As such, this novel approach
makes deep learning-based document classification suitable for large-scale

detectable only through searches for single pulses. While over 100 RRATs have
been detected, only a small fraction (roughly 20\%) have phase-connected timing
solutions, which are critical for determining how they relate to other neutron
star populations. Detecting more pulses in order to achieve solutions is a key
to understanding their physical nature. Astronomical signals collected by radio
telescopes contain noise from many sources, making the detection of weak pulses
difficult. Applying a denoising method to raw time series prior to performing a
single-pulse search typically leads to a more accurate estimation of their
times of arrival (TOAs). Taking into account some features of RRAT pulses and
noise, we present a denoising method based on wavelet data analysis, an
image-processing technique. Assuming that the spin period of an RRAT is known,
we estimate the frequency spectrum components contributing to the composition
of RRAT pulses. This allows us to suppress the noise, which contributes to
other frequencies. We apply the wavelet denoising method including selective
wavelet reconstruction and wavelet shrinkage to the de-dispersed time series of
eight RRATs with existing timing solutions. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of
most pulses are improved after wavelet denoising. Compared to the conventional
approach, we measure 12% to 69% more TOAs for the eight RRATs. The new timing
solutions for the eight RRATs show 16% to 90% smaller estimation error of most
parameters. Thus, we conclude that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for
denoising RRATs signal.
