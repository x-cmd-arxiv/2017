active-pixel vision sensors (DAVIS) can supplement other autonomous driving
sensors by providing a concurrent stream of standard active pixel sensor (APS)
images and DVS temporal contrast events. The APS stream is a sequence of
standard grayscale global-shutter image sensor frames. The DVS events represent
brightness changes occurring at a particular moment, with a jitter of about a
millisecond under most lighting conditions. They have a dynamic range of >120
dB and effective frame rates >1 kHz at data rates comparable to 30 fps
(frames/second) image sensors. To overcome some of the limitations of current
image acquisition technology, we investigate in this work the use of the
combined DVS and APS streams in end-to-end driving applications. The dataset
DDD17 accompanying this paper is the first open dataset of annotated DAVIS
driving recordings. DDD17 has over 12 h of a 346x260 pixel DAVIS sensor
recording highway and city driving in daytime, evening, night, dry and wet
weather conditions, along with vehicle speed, GPS position, driver steering,
throttle, and brake captured from the car's on-board diagnostics interface. As
an example application, we performed a preliminary end-to-end learning study of
using a convolutional neural network that is trained to predict the
instantaneous steering angle from DVS and APS visual data.

relevant physical effects inherent to these channels, based on the Peclet
number and the transmitter-receiver distance, we study when simplified models
of uniform flow and advection-only transport are applicable. For these two
regimes, analytical expressions for the channel impulse response are derived
and validated by particle-based simulation. Furthermore, as advection-only
transport is typically overlooked and hence not analyzed in the molecular
communication literature, we evaluate the symbol error rate for exemplary
on-off keying as performance metric.

environment by monitoring the content of local social media users. Often the
challenge is how to build a set of users from a target location. Here we
introduce a method for building such a set of users by using an
\emph{expand-classify} approach which begins with a small set of seed users
from the target location and then iteratively collects their neighbors and then
classifies their locations. We perform this classification using maximum
likelihood estimation on a factor graph model which incorporates features of
the user profile and also social network connections. We show that maximum
likelihood estimation reduces to solving a minimum cut problem on an
appropriately defined graph. We are able to obtain several thousand users
within a few hours for many diverse locations using our approach. Using
geo-located data, we find that our approach typically achieves good accuracy
for population centers with less than 500,000 inhabitants, while for larger
cities performance degrades somewhat. We also find that our approach is able to
collect many more users with higher accuracy than existing search methods.
Finally, we show that by studying the content of location specific users
obtained with our approach, we can identify the onset of significant social
unrest in locations such as the Philippines.

gain in direct dark matter search. An important accelerator were first
indications for a modulating signal rate in the DAMA/NaI experiment reported in
1997. Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and
phase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\sigma$ confidence.
The underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and
fundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search
could confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in
clear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter
halo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a
dependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will
convincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as
target. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel
detection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter
reading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages
arise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear
recoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key
benefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the
DAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby,
answer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D
phase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the
first one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this
measurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low
temperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal
in the form of scintillation light (in the light detector).

flares, and a fraction shows periodic activity. Several mechanisms might
explain this behavior but the lack of concurrent infrared (IR) data complicates
to identify the cause. Recently, 6.7 GHz methanol maser flares were observed,
triggered by accretion bursts of high-mass YSOs which confirmed the IR-pumping
of these masers. This suggests that regular IR changes might lead to maser
periodicity. Hence, we scrutinized space-based IR imaging of YSOs associated
with periodic methanol masers. We succeeded to extract the IR light curve from
NEOWISE data for the intermediate mass YSO G107.298+5.639. Thus, for the first
time a relationship between the maser and IR variability could be established.
While the IR light curve shows the same period of ~34.6 days as the masers, its
shape is distinct from that of the maser flares. Possible reasons for the IR
periodicity are discussed.

for material recognition using a large materials database. Many factors affect
thermal recognition performance, including sensor noise, the initial
temperatures of the sensor and the object, the thermal effusivities of the
materials, and the duration of contact. To analyze the influence of these
factors on thermal recognition, we used a semi-infinite solid based thermal
model to simulate heat-transfer data from all the materials in the CES Edupack
Level-1 database. We used support-vector machines (SVMs) to predict F1 scores
for binary material recognition for 2346 material pairs. We also collected data
using a real robot equipped with a thermal sensor and analyzed its material
recognition performance on 66 real-world material pairs. Additionally, we
analyzed the performance when the models were trained on the simulated data and
tested on the real-robot data. Our models predicted the material recognition
performance with a 0.980 F1 score for the simulated data, a 0.994 F1 score for
real-world data with constant initial sensor temperatures, a 0.966 F1 score for
real-world data with varied initial sensor temperatures, and a 0.815 F1 score
for sim-to-real transfer. Finally, we present some guidelines on sensor design
and parameter choice for thermal recognition based on the insights gained from
these results that would hopefully enable robotics researchers to use this
less-explored tactile sensing modality more effectively during physical

Different from optimally hole and electron-doped BaFe2As2, where there is a

above Tc, we find no spin excitation anisotropy for energies above 2 meV in the
normal state of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2. Upon entering the superconducting state,
significant spin excitation anisotropy develops at the antiferromagnetic (AF)
zone center QAF = (1, 0, L = odd), while magnetic spectrum is isotropy at the

navigated by 2D fluoroscopy which is insufficiently informative. Previously, a
semi-automatic 3D shape instantiation method was developed to instantiate the
3D shape of a main, deployed, and fenestrated stent graft from a single
fluoroscopy projection in real-time, which could help 3D FEVAR navigation and
robotic path planning. This proposed semi-automatic method was based on the
Robust Perspective-5-Point (RP5P) method, graft gap interpolation and
semi-automatic multiple-class marker center determination. In this paper, an
automatic 3D shape instantiation could be achieved by automatic multiple-class
marker segmentation and hence automatic multiple-class marker center
determination. Firstly, the markers were designed into five different shapes.
Then, Equally-weighted Focal U-Net was proposed to segment the fluoroscopy
projections of customized markers into five classes and hence to determine the
marker centers. The proposed Equally-weighted Focal U-Net utilized U-Net as the
network architecture, equally-weighted loss function for initial marker
segmentation, and then equally-weighted focal loss function for improving the
initial marker segmentation. This proposed network outperformed traditional
Weighted U-Net on the class-imbalance segmentation in this paper with reducing
one hyper-parameter - the weight. An overall mean Intersection over Union
(mIoU) of 0.6943 was achieved on 78 testing images, where 81.01% markers were
segmented with a center position error <1.6mm. Comparable accuracy of 3D shape
instantiation was also achieved and stated. The data, trained models and
TensorFlow codes are available on-line.

Sun; the exact mechanisms responsible for this heating are not yet fully
understood. We present for the first time a statistical test for one of the
proposed mechanisms, stochastic ion heating. We use the amplitude of magnetic
field fluctuations near the proton gyroscale as a proxy for the ratio of
gyroscale velocity fluctuations to perpendicular (with respect to the magnetic
field) proton thermal speed, defined as $\epsilon_p$. Enhanced proton
temperatures are observed when $\epsilon_p$ is larger than a critical value
($\sim 0.019 - 0.025$). This enhancement strongly depends on the proton plasma
beta ($\beta_{||p}$); when $\beta_{||p} \ll 1$ only the perpendicular proton
temperature $T_{\perp}$ increases, while for $\beta_{||p} \sim 1$ increased
parallel and perpendicular proton temperatures are both observed. For
$\epsilon_p$ smaller than the critical value and $\beta_{||p} \ll 1$ no
enhancement of $T_p$ is observed while for $\beta_{||p} \sim 1$ minor increases
in $T_{\parallel}$ are measured. The observed change of proton temperatures
across a critical threshold for velocity fluctuations is in agreement with the
stochastic ion heating model of Chandran et al. (2010). We find that
$\epsilon_p > \epsilon_{\rm crit}$ in 76\% of the studied periods implying that
stochastic heating may operate most of the time in the solar wind at 1 AU.

Specifically, we find evidence of low-dimensional determinism in flow reversals
occurring at zero Prandtl number, whereas we fail to find such signatures for
reversals at infinite Prandtl number. Thus, even in a single system, as one
varies the system parameters, one can encounter reversals that are
fundamentally different in nature. Consequently, we conclude that a single

consistent with electron bremsstrahlung. SGRE start times range from CME onset
to two hours later. Their durations range from about four minutes to twenty
hours and appear to be correlated with durations of >100 MeV SEP proton events.
The >300 MeV protons producing SGRE have spectra that can be fit with power
laws with a mean index of ~4 and RMS spread of 1.8. Gamma-ray line measurements
indicate that SGRE proton spectra are steeper above 300 MeV than they are below
300 MeV. The number of SGRE protons >500 MeV is on average about ten times more
than then the number in the associated flare and about fifty to one hundred
times less than the number in the accompanying SEP. SGRE can extend tens of
degrees from the are site. Sustained bremsstrahlung from MeV electrons was
observed in one SGRE event. Flare >100 keV X-ray emission appears to be
associated with SGRE and with intense SEPs. From this observation, we provide
arguments that lead us to propose that sub-MeV to MeV protons escaping from the

produce SGRE.

classification is an important challenge. The usual procedure is to fit a model
for the longitudinal response in the healthy population, a different model for
the longitudinal response in disease population, and then apply the Bayes'
theorem to obtain disease probabilities given the responses. Unfortunately,
when substantial heterogeneity exists within each population, this type of
Bayes classification may perform poorly. In this paper, we develop a new
approach by fitting a Bayesian nonparametric model for the joint outcome of
disease status and longitudinal response, and then use the clustering induced
by the Dirichlet process in our model to increase the flexibility of the
method, allowing for multiple subpopulations of healthy, diseased, and possibly
mixed membership. In addition, we introduce an MCMC sampling scheme that
facilitates the assessment of the inference and prediction capabilities of our
model. Finally, we demonstrate the method by predicting pregnancy outcomes
using longitudinal profiles on the $\beta$--HCG hormone levels in a sample of

prevent an application from reaching its maximum parallel performance. We
illustrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to address these

automatically capture the static and dynamic information of a loop. Moreover,
we advocate a novel method by introducing HPX smart executors for determining
the execution policy, chunk size, and prefetching distance of an HPX loop to
achieve higher possible performance by feeding static information captured
during compilation and runtime-based dynamic information to our learning model.
Our evaluated execution results show that using these smart executors can speed
up the HPX execution process by around 12%-35% for the Matrix Multiplication,

spanning over two orders of magnitude in radius, all four cold fronts fall onto
the same spiral pattern that wraps around the BCG NGC~1399, likely all
initiated by the infall of NGC~1404. The most evident front is to the
northeast, 10\,kpc from the cluster center, which separates low-entropy
high-metallicity gas and high-entropy low-metallicity gas. The metallicity map
suggests that gas sloshing, rather than an AGN outburst, is the driving force
behind the redistribution of the enriched gas in this cluster. The innermost
cold front resides within the radius of the strong cool core. The sloshing time
scale within the cooling radius, calculated from the Brunt-V$\ddot{\rm
a}$s$\ddot{\rm a}$l$\ddot{\rm a}$ frequency, is an order of magnitude shorter
than the cooling time. It is plausible that gas sloshing can contribute to the
heating of the cool core, provided that gas of different entropies can be mixed
effectively via Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The estimated age of the
outermost front suggests that this is not the first infall of NGC~1404.

the coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM)
to investigate the sedimentation process of non-cohesive particles, including
the hindered settling stage and the deposition stage. Firstly, the coupled
CFD-DEM model for sedimentation is validated by the hindered settling velocity
at different solid volume concentrations of suspension (0.05~0.6). Two typical
modes of sedimentation are also presented by the concentration profiles and the
equal-concentration lines. Then, the comparisons between mono- and
poly-dispersed particle system are detailed. In the sedimentation of the
poly-dispersed particle system, the segregation phenomenon is simulated.
Furthermore, this segregation effect reduces with the increase of the initial
solid concentration of suspension. From the simulations, the contact force
between every pair of particles can be obtained, hence we demonstrate the
""effective stress principle"" from the view of the particle contact force by
giving the correspondence between the particle contact force and the ""effective
stress"", which is a critical concept of soil mechanics. We also demonstrate the
effective stress principle from the view of the contact force acting on
particles. Moreover, the deposition stage can be simulated by CFD-DEM method,
therefore the solid concentrations of sediment bed on different conditions are
studied. Based on the simulation results of maximum solid concentration and the
theory of sedimentation, this paper also discusses a method to calculate the
critical time when sedimentation ends of two typical modes of sedimentation.

number of random queries necessary to recover a hidden bijective labeling of

asks, which objects have these labels? We consider here an asymmetric version
of the problem in which in every query an object is chosen with probability $p
> 1/2$ and we ignore ""inconclusive"" queries. We study the number of queries
needed to recover the labeling in its entirety ($H_n$), before at least one

This problem exhibits several remarkable behaviors: $D_n$ converges in
probability but not almost surely, $H_n$ and $F_n$ exhibit phase transitions
with respect to $p$ in the second term. We prove that for $p>1/2$ with high
probability (whp) we need $H_n=\log_{1/p} n +\frac 12 \log_{p/(1-p)}\log n
+o(\log \log n) $ queries to recover the entire bijection. This should be

Rubin, who proved that in this case one requires $H_n=\log_{2} n +\sqrt{2

results for random PATRICIA tries, as the problem is probabilistically
equivalent to that of the height, fillup level, and typical depth of a PATRICIA

decomposition is a powerful way for compressing the redundant information in
the set of orbital pairs, and has been used to accelerate quantum chemistry
calculations in a number of contexts. The key ingredient of the ISDF
decomposition is to select a set of non-uniform grid points, so that the values
of the orbital pairs evaluated at such grid points can be used to accurately
interpolate those evaluated at all grid points. The set of non-uniform grid
points, called the interpolation points, can be automatically selected by a QR
factorization with column pivoting (QRCP) procedure. This is the
computationally most expensive step in the construction of the ISDF
decomposition. In this work, we propose a new approach to find the
interpolation points based on the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) method,
which offers a much less expensive alternative to the QRCP procedure when ISDF
is used in the context of hybrid functional electronic structure calculations.
The CVT method only uses information from the electron density, and can be
efficiently implemented using a K-Means algorithm. We find that this new method
achieves comparable accuracy to the ISDF-QRCP method, at a cost that is
negligible in the overall hybrid functional calculations. For instance, for a
system containing $1000$ silicon atoms simulated using the HSE06 hybrid
functional on $2000$ computational cores, the cost of QRCP-based method for
finding the interpolation points costs $434.2$ seconds, while the CVT procedure
only takes $3.2$ seconds. We also find that the ISDF-CVT method also enhances
the smoothness of the potential energy surface in the context of \emph{ab
initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with hybrid functionals.

taken at +3 day relative to the peak. Our data reveal two sets of absorption
systems, separated by 235 km/s, at redshifts matching the host galaxy, NGC3191
and its companion galaxy 73 arcsec apart. Weakly damped Lyman-alpha absorption
lines are detected at these two redshifts, with HI column densities of
$(3.0\pm0.8)\times10^{19}$ and $(3.7\pm0.9)\times10^{19}$\,cm$^{-2}$
respectively. This is an order of magnitude smaller than HI column densities in
the disks of nearby galaxies ($>10^{10}M_\odot$) and suggests that SN2017egm is
on the near side of NGC3191 and has a low host extinction (E(B-V)=0.007). Using
unsaturated metal absorption lines and taking into account of H ionization and
dust depletion corrections, we find that the host of SN2017egm probably has a
solar or higher metallicity and is unlikely to be a dwarf companion to NGC3191.
Comparison of early-time UV spectra of SN2017egm, Gaia16apd, iPTF13ajg and
PTF12dam finds that the continuum at wavelength > 2800A is well fit by a
blackbody, whereas the continuum at wavelength < 2800A is considerably below
the model. The degree of UV suppression varies from source to source, with the
1400A to 2800A continuum flux ratio of 1.5 for Gaia16apd and 0.4 for iPTF13ajg.
This can not be explained by the differences in magnetar power or blackbody
temperature (i.e. color temperature). Finally, the UV spectra reveal a common
set of seven broad absorption features and their equivalent widths are similar
(within a factor of 2) among the four events. These seven features bode well
for future high-z SLSN-I spectral classifications.

a new heuristic involving an optimization over a parametrized family of Gromov

Compared with the breadth-first search tree heuristic commonly adopted in the
literature, simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves better
estimation accuracy than several other benchmark algorithms, even though these
require more information like the diffusion parameters. We next develop a
multiple sources estimation algorithm for general graphs, which first
partitions the graph into source candidate clusters, and then applies our
single source estimation algorithm to each cluster. We show that if the graph
is a tree, then each source candidate cluster contains at least one source.
Simulations using synthetic and real networks, and experiments using real-world

adopt a modified three-dimensional dislocation dynamics. Using the present
modeling approach, which employs three-dimensional dislocation dynamics
simulations, we obtain thousands of data points, accounting for various
precipitate resistances, applied shear stresses, and precipitate spacing. The
material of reference is Copper (Cu). From the simulations, which quantify the
dislocation-precipitate interaction in terms of the applied shear stress,
precipitate resistance scale, and dislocation-precipitate interaction time, we
found a universal equation. The dislocation-precipitate interaction time versus
precipitate resistance and stress, referred to as the ""dislocation-precipitate

edges of $K_n$, there is a vertex cover by $2\sqrt{n}$ monochromatic paths of
the same colour, which is optimal up to a constant factor. The main goal of
this paper is to study the natural multi-colour generalization of this problem:
given two positive integers $r,s$, what is the smallest number
$\text{pc}_{r,s}(K_n)$ such that in every colouring of the edges of $K_n$ with
$r$ colours, there exists a vertex cover of $K_n$ by $\text{pc}_{r,s}(K_n)$
monochromatic paths using altogether at most $s$ different colours? For fixed
integers $r>s$ and as $n\to\infty$, we prove that $\text{pc}_{r,s}(K_n) =
\Theta(n^{1/\chi})$, where $\chi=\max{\{1,2+2s-r\}}$ is the chromatic number of
the Kneser gr aph $\text{KG}(r,r-s)$. More generally, if one replaces $K_n$ by
an arbitrary $n$-vertex graph with fixed independence number $\alpha$, then we
have $\text{pc}_{r,s}(G) = O(n^{1/\chi})$, where this time around $\chi$ is the
chromatic number of the Kneser hypergraph $\text{KG}^{(\alpha+1)}(r,r-s)$. This
result is tight in the sense that there exist graphs with independence number
$\alpha$ for which $\text{pc}_{r,s}(G) = \Omega(n^{1/\chi})$. This is in sharp
contrast to the case $r=s$, where it follows from a result of S\'ark\""ozy
(2012) that $\text{pc}_{r,r}(G)$ depends only on $r$ and $\alpha$, but not on
the number of vertices. We obtain similar results for the situation where
instead of using paths, one wants to cover a graph with bounded independence
number by monochromatic cycles, or a complete graph by monochromatic
$d$-regular graphs.

become extremely crowded. In order to counter security threats posed by rogue
or unknown transmitters, it is important to identify RF transmitters not by the
data content of the transmissions but based on the intrinsic physical
characteristics of the transmitters. RF waveforms represent a particular
challenge because of the extremely high data rates involved and the potentially
large number of transmitters present in a given location. These factors outline
the need for rapid fingerprinting and identification methods that go beyond the
traditional hand-engineered approaches. In this study, we investigate the use
of machine learning (ML) strategies to the classification and identification
problems, and the use of wavelets to reduce the amount of data required. Four
different ML strategies are evaluated: deep neural nets (DNN), convolutional
neural nets (CNN), support vector machines (SVM), and multi-stage training
(MST) using accelerated Levenberg-Marquardt (A-LM) updates. The A-LM MST method
preconditioned by wavelets was by far the most accurate, achieving 100%
classification accuracy of transmitters, as tested using data originating from
12 different transmitters. We discuss strategies for extension of MST to a much
larger number of transmitters.

bounds of edge expansion in normal graphs in terms of the second eigenvalue of
the graph's Laplacian operator. Recently this inequality has been extended to
undirected hypergraphs and directed normal graphs via a non-linear operator
associated with a diffusion process in the underlying graph.
  In this work, we develop a unifying framework for defining a diffusion
operator on a directed hypergraph with stationary vertices, which is general
enough for the following two applications.
  1. Cheeger's inequality for directed hyperedge expansion.
  2. Quadratic optimization with stationary vertices in the context of
semi-supervised learning.
  Despite the crucial role of the diffusion process in spectral analysis,
previous works have not formally established the existence of the corresponding
diffusion processes. In this work, we give a proof framework that can indeed
show that such diffusion processes are well-defined. In the first application,
we use the spectral properties of the diffusion operator to achieve the
Cheeger's inequality for directed hyperedge expansion. In the second
application, the diffusion operator can be interpreted as giving a continuous
analog to the subgradient method, which moves the feasible solution in discrete
steps towards an optimal solution.

training a traditional text classifier. In recent years, a few dataless text
classification techniques have been proposed to address this problem. However,
existing works mainly center on single-label classification problems, that is,
each document is restricted to belonging to a single category. In this paper,
we propose a novel Seed-guided Multi-label Topic Model, named SMTM. With a few
seed words relevant to each category, SMTM conducts multi-label classification
for a collection of documents without any labeled document. In SMTM, each
category is associated with a single category-topic which covers the meaning of
the category. To accommodate with multi-labeled documents, we explicitly model
the category sparsity in SMTM by using spike and slab prior and weak smoothing
prior. That is, without using any threshold tuning, SMTM automatically selects
the relevant categories for each document. To incorporate the supervision of
the seed words, we propose a seed-guided biased GPU (i.e., generalized Polya
urn) sampling procedure to guide the topic inference of SMTM. Experiments on
two public datasets show that SMTM achieves better classification accuracy than
state-of-the-art alternatives and even outperforms supervised solutions in some
scenarios.

to such discrete problems. We first introduce the problem of stochastic
submodular optimization, where one needs to optimize a submodular objective
which is given as an expectation. Our model captures situations where the
discrete objective arises as an empirical risk (e.g., in the case of
exemplar-based clustering), or is given as an explicit stochastic model (e.g.,
in the case of influence maximization in social networks). By exploiting that
common extensions act linearly on the class of submodular functions, we employ
projected stochastic gradient ascent and its variants in the continuous domain,
and perform rounding to obtain discrete solutions. We focus on the rich and
widely used family of weighted coverage functions. We show that our approach
yields solutions that are guaranteed to match the optimal approximation
guarantees, while reducing the computational cost by several orders of
magnitude, as we demonstrate empirically.

the boundaries between classes. This can lead to ambiguous features being
generated near class boundaries, reducing target classification accuracy. We
propose a novel approach, Adversarial Dropout Regularization (ADR), to
encourage the generator to output more discriminative features for the target

non-discriminative features, using dropout on the classifier network. The
generator then learns to avoid these areas of the feature space and thus
creates better features. We apply our ADR approach to the problem of

  muons","Nature (2017)",,"10.1038/nature24647",,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Great Pyramid or Khufu's Pyramid was built on the Giza Plateau (Egypt)
during the IVth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), who reigned from 2509 to
2483 BC. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there
is no consensus about how it was built. To better understand its internal
structure, we imaged the pyramid using muons, which are by-products of cosmic
rays that are only partially absorbed by stone. The resulting cosmic-ray muon
radiography allows us to visualize the known and potentially unknown voids in
the pyramid in a non-invasive way. Here we report the discovery of a large void
(with a cross section similar to the Grand Gallery and a length of 30 m
minimum) above the Grand Gallery, which constitutes the first major inner
structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century. This void, named
ScanPyramids Big Void, was first observed with nuclear emulsion films installed
in the Queen's chamber (University of Nagoya), then confirmed with scintillator
hodoscopes set up in the same chamber (KEK) and re-confirmed with gas detectors
outside of the pyramid (CEA). This large void has therefore been detected with
a high confidence by three different muon detection technologies and three
independent analyses. These results constitute a breakthrough for the
understanding of Khufu's Pyramid and its internal structure. While there is
currently no information about the role of this void, these findings show how
modern particle physics can shed new light on the world's archaeological
heritage.

However, usually the former introduces additional parameters, while the latter
increases the runtime. As an alternative we propose the Tensorized LSTM in
which the hidden states are represented by tensors and updated via a
cross-layer convolution. By increasing the tensor size, the network can be
widened efficiently without additional parameters since the parameters are
shared across different locations in the tensor; by delaying the output, the
network can be deepened implicitly with little additional runtime since deep
computations for each timestep are merged into temporal computations of the
sequence. Experiments conducted on five challenging sequence learning tasks
show the potential of the proposed model.

signal processing research topic due to its widespread applications. Using
spherical microphone arrays (SMA), DOA estimation can be applied in the
spherical harmonic (SH) domain without any spatial ambiguity. However, the
environment reverberation and noise can degrade the estimation performance. In
this paper, we propose a new expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for
deterministic maximum likelihood (ML) DOA estimation of L sound sources in the
presence of spatially nonuniform noise in the SH domain. Furthermore a new
closed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the deterministic ML DOA estimation is
derived for the signal model in the SH domain. The main idea of the proposed
algorithm is considering the general model of the received signal in the SH
domain, we reduce the complexity of the ML estimation by breaking it down into
two steps: expectation and maximization steps. The proposed algorithm reduces
the complexity from 2L-dimensional space to L 2-dimensional space. Simulation
results indicate that the proposed algorithm shows at least an improvement of
6dB in robustness in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Moreover, the RMSE
of the proposed algorithm is very close to the CRB compared to the recent
methods in reverberant and noisy environments in the large range of signal to
noise ratio.

an obfuscated distance measure that can conceal Hamming distance in a dynamic

reliable methods for retrieving most likely candidates without knowing the
exact distance values. We further propose to apply Montgomery multiplication
for generating search indexes that can withstand adversarial similarity

has attracted many researchers in the last decades. Recent developments are the
consideration of pair correlations in the effective description, which lead to
a much more precise description of both spectral properties and the dynamics of
the Bose gas in the weak coupling limit. While mean-field results typically
lead to convergence for the reduced density matrix only, one obtains norm
convergence when considering the pair correlations proposed by Bogoliubov in
his seminal 1947 paper. In this article we consider an interacting Bose gas in
the case where both the volume and the density of the gas tend to infinity
simultaneously. We assume that the coupling constant is such that the
self-interaction of the fluctuations is of leading order, which leads to a
finite (non-zero) speed of sound in the gas. In our first main result we show
that the difference between the N-body and the Bogoliubov description is small
in $L^2$ as the density of the gas tends to infinity and the volume does not
grow too fast. This describes the dynamics of delocalized excitations of the
order of the volume. In our second main result we consider an interacting Bose
gas near the ground state with a macroscopic localized excitation of order of
the density. We prove that the microscopic dynamics of the excitation coming
from the N-body Schr\""odinger equation converges to an effective dynamics which
is free evolution with the Bogoliubov dispersion relation. The main technical
novelty are estimates for all moments of the number of particles outside the
condensate for large volume, and in particular control of the tails of their

sampled time-domain. We additionally consider data from the IRAM 30-m Telescope
as well as the SMA. Jet properties such as the electric vectors, the
(polarized) flux density, feature size, and brightness temperature, describe a
complex evolution of the polarized jet. The electric vector position angles
(EVPAs) of features traveling down the jet perform a large and smooth rotation
of $\gtrsim 180^{\circ}$ across a distance of about 20 pc. In contrast, the
EVPAs are strongly variable within the first parsecs of the jet. We find a
tendency towards transverse EVPAs across the jet with a local anomaly of
aligned vectors in between. The transverse extent of the flow decreases
coincident with a jump in brightness temperature around where we observe the
EVPAs to turn into alignment with the jet flow. Also the gradients of the
feature size and particle density with distance steepen in that region. We
interpret the propagating polarized features with shocks and the observed local
anomalies with the interaction of these shocks with a recollimation shock of
the underlying flow. Together with a sheared magnetic field, this shock-shock
interaction can explain the large rotation of the EVPA. The superimposed
variability of the EVPAs close to the core is likely related to a clumpy
Faraday screen, which also contributes significantly to the observed EVPA
rotation in that region.

the $n \times n$ kernel matrix $K$ is approximated via a rank-$k$ matrix
$\tilde K$ which can be stored in much less space and processed more quickly.
In this work we study the limits of computationally efficient low-rank kernel
approximation. We show that for a broad class of kernels, including the popular
Gaussian and polynomial kernels, computing a relative error $k$-rank
approximation to $K$ is at least as difficult as multiplying the input data
matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ by an arbitrary matrix $C \in
\mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$. Barring a breakthrough in fast matrix multiplication,
when $k$ is not too large, this requires $\Omega(nnz(A)k)$ time where $nnz(A)$
is the number of non-zeros in $A$. This lower bound matches, in many parameter
regimes, recent work on subquadratic time algorithms for low-rank approximation
of general kernels [MM16,MW17], demonstrating that these algorithms are
unlikely to be significantly improved, in particular to $O(nnz(A))$ input
sparsity runtimes. At the same time there is hope: we show for the first time
that $O(nnz(A))$ time approximation is possible for general radial basis
function kernels (e.g., the Gaussian kernel) for the closely related problem of
low-rank approximation of the kernelized dataset.

cannot constrain whether or not the turbulence driving parameter, $b$, and/or

an adequate fit to the cloud sample as a whole. When considering the average

combined with a weak magnetic field ($b \gtrsim 0.7$ and $\beta \gtrsim 3$),
(ii) weak compression ($b \lesssim 0.35$), and (iii) strong magnetic field
($\beta \lesssim 0.1$). Including independent magnetic field strength estimates

parameters larger than unity, which indicates a discrepancy with the
turbulence-dominated picture; we discuss the possible reasons for this.

Volumetrically larger CdSe dots were found to have smaller band-gaps but higher
transition matrix elements and Fermi factors. The maximum optical gain for dots
was observed to have an initially positive and then negative correlation with
their real-space size as a result of combined effects of various factors. For
the shape effects, cubic dots were found to have smaller band-gaps, Fermi
factors and transition matrix elements than spherical dots due to higher level
of asymmetry and different surface effects. Consequently, cubic dots have lower
emission energy, smaller amplification. The occurrence of near E1-H1 transition
broadens the gain spectrum of cubic dots. Cubic and spherical dots are both
proven to be promising candidates for optical devices under visible range. We
have demonstrated that size and shape change could both effectively alter the
properties of quantum dots and therefore recommend consideration of both when

both virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell transmissions to understand the dynamical
behavior of HIV infection in vivo. In the model, we consider the proliferation
of uninfected CD4+ T cells by a logistic function and the infected CD4+ T cells
are assumed to have an infection-age structure. Our main results concern the
Hopf bifurcation of the model by using the theory of integrated semigroup and
the Hopf bifurcation theory for semilinear equations with nondense domain.
Bifurcation analysis indicates that there exist some parameter values such that
this HIV infection model has a non-trivial periodic solution which bifurcates
from the positive equilibrium. The numerical simulations are also carried out.

for the fermionic tower is formulated. This study proves that the energy states
with increasing spin are simply composite systems made by a bradyon and
antitachyons with half-integer spin. The quantum field describing these exotic
states is obtained by the infinite sum of four-spinor operators, which each
operator depends on the spin and the rest mass of the bradyon in its
fundamental state. The interaction between bradyon-tachyon, tachyon-tachyon and
tachyon-luxon has also been considered and included in the total Lagrangian.
The obtained theory is consistent with the CPT invariance and the
spin-statistics theorem and could explain the existence of new forms of matter
not predictable within the standard model.

fields through the process of iterative N\""other coupling. This procedure is

prescription originating from the Gauge Principle. Prospects of this

shown great potential in face recognition in recent years. Most previous RC
methods are based on the conventional regression models, such as lasso
regression, ridge regression or group lasso regression. These regression models
essentially impose a predefined assumption on the distribution of the noise
variable in the query sample, such as the Gaussian or Laplacian distribution.
However, the complicated noises in practice may violate the assumptions and
impede the performance of these RC methods. In this paper, we propose a modal
regression based atomic representation and classification (MRARC) framework to
alleviate such limitation. Unlike previous RC methods, the MRARC framework does
not require the noise variable to follow any specific predefined distributions.
This gives rise to the capability of MRARC in handling various complex noises
in reality. Using MRARC as a general platform, we also develop four novel RC
methods for unimodal and multimodal face recognition, respectively. In
addition, we devise a general optimization algorithm for the unified MRARC
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and
half-quadratic theory. The experiments on real-world data validate the efficacy
of MRARC for robust face recognition.
