an all-dielectric CMOS-compatible metasurface. The design is based on
guided-mode resonance which provides a high quality factor resonance to make
the edge detection experimentally realizable. The proposed structure that is
easy to fabricate, can be exploited for detection of edges in two dimensions
due to its symmetry. Also, the trade-off between gain and resolution of edge
detection is discussed which can be adjusted by appropriate design parameters.
The proposed edge detector has also the potential to be used in ultrafast
analog computing and image processing.

structure (AMQ)---maintains a compact, probabilistic representation of a set S
of keys from a universe U. An AMQ supports lookups, inserts, and (for some
AMQs) deletes. A query for an x in S is guaranteed to return ""present."" A query
for x not in S returns ""absent"" with probability at least 1-epsilon, where
epsilon is a tunable false positive probability. If a query returns ""present,""
but x is not in S, then x is a false positive of the AMQ. Because AMQs have a
nonzero probability of false-positives, they require far less space than
explicit set representations.
  AMQs are widely used to speed up dictionaries that are stored remotely (e.g.,
on disk/across a network). Most AMQs offer weak guarantees on the number of
false positives they will return on a sequence of queries. The false-positive
probability of epsilon holds only for a single query. It is easy for an
adversary to drive an AMQ's false-positive rate towards 1 by simply repeating
false positives.
  This paper shows what it takes to get strong guarantees on the number of
false positives. We say that an AMQs is adaptive if it guarantees a
false-positive probability of epsilon for every query, regardless of answers to
previous queries. First, we prove that it is impossible to build a small
adaptive AMQ, even when the AMQ is immediately told whenever it returns a false
positive. We then show how to build an adaptive AMQ that partitions its state
into a small local component and a larger remote component. In addition to
being adaptive, the local component of our AMQ dominates existing AMQs in all
regards. It uses optimal space up to lower-order terms and supports queries and
updates in worst-case constant time, with high probability. Thus, we show that
adaptivity has no cost.

because geodesics starting near the horizon radius cannot escape to infinity

  (ii) If $B=1$, even in constant-degree graphs any algorithm must take

calculate the energy a clump of plasma orbiting in the accretion disk releases

previous works, we highlight the strong tidal force as mechanism to dissipate
such energy. We show that tides acting on the clump are able to reproduce the
observed coherence of the upper HF QPO seen in LMXBs with a neutron star (NS).
The quantity of energy released by the clump and relativistic boosting might
give a modulation amplitude in agreement with that observed in the upper HF
QPO. Both the amplitude and coherence of the upper HF QPO in NS LMXBs could

  Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops an algorithmic framework for real-time optimization of
distribution-level distributed energy resources (DERs). The proposed framework
optimizes the operation of both DERs that are individually controllable and
groups of DERs (i.e., aggregations) at an electrical point of connection that
are jointly controlled. From an electrical standpoint, wye and delta single-
and multi-phase connections are accounted for. The algorithm enables (groups
of) DERs to pursue given performance objectives, while adjusting their
(aggregate) powers to respond to services requested by grid operators and to
maintain electrical quantities within engineering limits. The design of the
algorithm leverages a time-varying bi-level problem formulation capturing
various performance objectives and engineering constraints, and an online
implementation of primal-dual projected-gradient methods. The gradient steps
are suitably modified to accommodate appropriate measurements from the
distribution network and the DERs. By virtue of this approach, the resultant
algorithm can cope with inaccuracies in the distribution-system modeling, it
avoids pervasive metering to gather the state of non-controllable resources,
and it naturally lends itself to a distributed implementation. Analytical
stability and convergence claims are established in terms of tracking of the
solution of the formulated time-varying optimization problem. The proposed
method is tested in a realistic distribution system with real data.

analysis, for obtaining upper bounds on the capacity of the binary deletion
channel and, more generally, channels with i.i.d. insertions and deletions.
Other than the classical deletion channel, we give a special attention to the
Poisson-repeat channel introduced by Mitzenmacher and Drinea (IEEE Transactions
on Information Theory, 2006). Our framework can be applied to obtain capacity
upper bounds for any repetition distribution (the deletion and Poisson-repeat
channels corresponding to the special cases of Bernoulli and Poisson
distributions). Our techniques essentially reduce the task of proving capacity
upper bounds to maximizing a univariate, real-valued, and often concave
function over a bounded interval. We show the following:
  1. The capacity of the binary deletion channel with deletion probability $d$
is at most $(1-d)\log\varphi$ for $d\geq 1/2$, and, assuming the capacity
function is convex, is at most $1-d\log(4/\varphi)$ for $d<1/2$, where
$\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio. This is the first nontrivial
capacity upper bound for any value of $d$ outside the limiting case $d\to 0$
that is fully explicit and proved without computer assistance.
  2. We derive the first set of capacity upper bounds for the Poisson-repeat
channel.
  3. We derive several novel upper bounds on the capacity of the deletion
channel. All upper bounds are maximums of efficiently computable, and concave,
univariate real functions over a bounded domain. In turn, we upper bound these
functions in terms of explicit elementary and standard special functions, whose
maximums can be found even more efficiently (and sometimes, analytically, for
example for $d=1/2$).
  Along the way, we develop several new techniques of potentially independent
interest in information theory, probability, and mathematical analysis.

essential task in sonar, radar, acoustics, biomedical and multimedia
applications. Many state of the art wide-band DOA estimators coherently process
frequency binned array outputs by approximate Maximum Likelihood, Weighted
Subspace Fitting or focusing techniques. This paper shows that bin signals
obtained by filter-bank approaches do not obey the finite rank narrow-band
array model, because spectral leakage and the change of the array response with
frequency within the bin create \emph{ghost sources} dependent on the
particular realization of the source process. Therefore, existing DOA
estimators based on binning cannot claim consistency even with the perfect
knowledge of the array response. In this work, a more realistic array model
with a finite length of the sensor impulse responses is assumed, which still
has finite rank under a space-time formulation. It is shown that signal
subspaces at arbitrary frequencies can be consistently recovered under mild
conditions by applying MUSIC-type (ST-MUSIC) estimators to the dominant
eigenvectors of the wide-band space-time sensor cross-correlation matrix. A
novel Maximum Likelihood based ST-MUSIC subspace estimate is developed in order
to recover consistency. The number of sources active at each frequency are
estimated by Information Theoretic Criteria. The sample ST-MUSIC subspaces can
be fed to any subspace fitting DOA estimator at single or multiple frequencies.
Simulations confirm that the new technique clearly outperforms binning
approaches at sufficiently high signal to noise ratio, when model mismatches
exceed the noise floor.

hyper-intervals so as to obtain computable and useful abstractions is unsolved.
This note provides a twofold contribution towards a solution. Firstly, we
present a functional to predict the computational effort for the abstraction to
be computed. Secondly, we propose a method for choosing the aspect ratio of the
hyper-intervals when their volume is fixed. More precisely, we propose to
choose the aspect ratio so as to minimize a predicted number of transitions of
the abstraction to be computed, in order to reduce the computational effort. To
this end, we derive a functional to predict the number of transitions in
dependence of the aspect ratio. The functional is to be minimized subject to
suitable constraints. We characterize the unique solvability of the respective
optimization problem and prove that it transforms, under appropriate
assumptions, into an equivalent convex problem with strictly convex objective.
The latter problem can then be globally solved using standard numerical
methods. We demonstrate our approach on an example.

large spatial separation. Reconciling this property with the inherent
uncertainty in quantum states is at the heart of some of the most famous
debates in the development of quantum theory. Nonetheless, entanglement
nowadays has a solid theoretical and experimental foundation, and it is the
crucial resource behind many emerging quantum technologies. Entanglement has
been demonstrated for microscopic systems, such as with photons, ions, and
electron spins, and more recently in microwave and electromechanical devices.
For macroscopic objects, however, entanglement becomes exceedingly fragile
towards environmental disturbances. A major outstanding goal has been to create
and verify the entanglement between the motional states of slowly-moving
massive objects. Here, we carry out such an experimental demonstration, with
the moving bodies realized as two micromechanical oscillators coupled to a
microwave-frequency electromagnetic cavity that is used to create and stabilise
the entanglement of the centre-of-mass motion of the oscillators. We infer the
existence of entanglement in the steady state by combining measurement of
correlated mechanical fluctuations with an analysis of the microwaves emitted

Researchers, both in academia and industry, have introduced many techniques to

making application A run more efficiently on machine 1. In this paper, we
extend this criteria by asking: can profiling information of application A on

becomes better and more efficient. We present a generalized method for using

Partition functions of graphical models play a fundamental role is statistical

Variational Methods. An impressive body of work in mathematics, physics and
theoretical computer science provides conditions under which Markov Chain Monte
Carlo methods converge in polynomial time. These methods often lead to
polynomial time approximation algorithms for the partition function in cases
where the underlying model exhibits correlation decay. There are very few
theoretical guarantees for the performance of variational methods. One
exception is recent results by Risteski (2016) who considered dense graphical
models and showed that using variational methods, it is possible to find an
$O(\epsilon n)$ additive approximation to the log partition function in time
$n^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ even in a regime where correlation decay does not hold.
  We show that under essentially the same conditions, an $O(\epsilon n)$
additive approximation of the log partition function can be found in constant
time, independent of $n$. In particular, our results cover dense Ising and
Potts models as well as dense graphical models with $k$-wise interaction. They
also apply for low threshold rank models.

background noise and improve target localization accuracy and robustness. We
chose a pre-selected seven-channel complementary features including RGB color,
intensity and spatial pyramid of HoG to encode object color, shape and spatial

demands of real-time performance. A novel fast algorithm is presented to
accurately evaluate spatially weighted local histograms in constant time

techniques are explored to efficiently compute integral histogram on GPU

is necessary to attain high quality of TI-SC hybrid devices, because the
physical surfaces of V-VI three-dimensional TIs suffer from degradation at
ambient conditions. Here, we present an in-situ process, which allows to
fabricate such hybrids by combining molecular beam epitaxy and stencil
lithography. As-prepared Josephson junctions show nearly perfect interface
transparency and very large $I_CR_N$ products. The Shapiro response of radio
frequency measurements indicates the presence of gapless Andreev bound states,
so-called Majorana bound states.

challenging task, especially for intraoperative applications that require fast
and robust algorithms. We propose a weakly-supervised, label-driven formulation
for learning 3D voxel correspondence from higher-level label correspondence,
thereby bypassing classical intensity-based image similarity measures. During
training, a convolutional neural network is optimised by outputting a dense
displacement field (DDF) that warps a set of available anatomical labels from
the moving image to match their corresponding counterparts in the fixed image.
These label pairs, including solid organs, ducts, vessels, point landmarks and
other ad hoc structures, are only required at training time and can be
spatially aligned by minimising a cross-entropy function of the warped moving
label and the fixed label. During inference, the trained network takes a new
image pair to predict an optimal DDF, resulting in a fully-automatic,
label-free, real-time and deformable registration. For interventional
applications where large global transformation prevails, we also propose a
neural network architecture to jointly optimise the global- and local
displacements. Experiment results are presented based on cross-validating
registrations of 111 pairs of T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and 3D
transrectal ultrasound images from prostate cancer patients with a total of

significantly impacted multiple aspects of our planet, including its potential
for habitability and its spectral appearance. Here, we model worlds with
Archean-like levels of carbon dioxide orbiting the ancient sun and an M4V dwarf
(GJ 876) and show that organic haze formation requires methane fluxes
consistent with estimated Earth-like biological production rates. On planets
with high fluxes of biogenic organic sulfur gases (CS2, OCS, CH3SH, and
CH3SCH3), photochemistry involving these gases can drive haze formation at
lower CH4/CO2 ratios than methane photochemistry alone. For a planet orbiting
the sun, at 30x the modern organic sulfur gas flux, haze forms at a CH4/CO2
ratio 20% lower than at 1x the modern organic sulfur flux. For a planet
orbiting the M4V star, the impact of organic sulfur gases is more pronounced:
at 1x the modern Earth organic sulfur flux, a substantial haze forms at CH4/CO2
~ 0.2, but at 30x the organic sulfur flux, the CH4/CO2 ratio needed to form
haze decreases by a full order of magnitude. Detection of haze at an
anomalously low CH4/CO2 ratio could suggest the influence of these biogenic
sulfur gases, and therefore imply biological activity on an exoplanet. When
these organic sulfur gases are not readily detectable in the spectrum of an
Earth-like exoplanet, the thick organic haze they can help produce creates a
very strong absorption feature at UV-blue wavelengths detectable in reflected
light at a spectral resolution as low as 10. In direct imaging, constraining
CH4 and CO2 concentrations will require higher spectral resolution, and R > 170

will undergo the process of atomic collapse where electrons sink into the
positron continuum and a new family of so-called collapsing states emerges. The
relativistic electrons in graphene exhibit the same physics but at a much lower
critical charge ($Z_c \approx 1$) which has made it possible to confirm this
phenomenon experimentally. However, there exist conflicting predictions on the
effect of a magnetic field on atomic collapse. These theoretical predictions
are based on the continuum Dirac-Weyl equation, which does not have an exact
analytical solution for the interplay of a supercritical Coulomb potential and
the magnetic field. Approximative solutions have been proposed, but because the
two effects compete on similar energy scales, the theoretical treatment varies
depending on the regime which is being considered. These limitations are
overcome here by starting from a tight-binding approach and computing exact
numerical results. By avoiding special limit cases, we found a smooth evolution
between the different regimes. We predict that the atomic collapse effect
persists even after the magnetic field is activated and that the critical
charge remains unchanged. We show that the atomic collapse regime is
characterized: 1) by a series of Landau level anticrossings and 2) by the
absence of $\sqrt{B}$ scaling of the Landau levels with regard to magnetic
field strength.

geophysics and finance, view individual actions as discrete events in
continuous time, and modulate the rate of events according to the self-exciting

identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered

a Hawkes process. This result paves the way to apply tools developed for SIR to
Hawkes, and vice versa. It also leads to HawkesN, a generalization of the
Hawkes model which accounts for a finite population size. Finally, we derive
the distribution of cascade sizes for HawkesN, inspired by methods in

perturbed by Gaussian noise. If the empirical distribution of the entries of
the spikes is known, optimal estimators that exploit this knowledge can
substantially outperform simple spectral approaches. Recent work characterizes
the asymptotic accuracy of Bayes-optimal estimators in the high-dimensional
limit. In this paper we present a practical algorithm that can achieve
Bayes-optimal accuracy above the spectral threshold. A bold conjecture from
statistical physics posits that no polynomial-time algorithm achieves optimal
error below the same threshold (unless the best estimator is trivial). Our
approach uses Approximate Message Passing (AMP) in conjunction with a spectral
initialization. AMP algorithms have proved successful in a variety of
statistical estimation tasks, and are amenable to exact asymptotic analysis via
state evolution. Unfortunately, state evolution is uninformative when the
algorithm is initialized near an unstable fixed point, as often happens in
low-rank matrix estimation. We develop a new analysis of AMP that allows for
spectral initializations. Our main theorem is general and applies beyond matrix
estimation. However, we use it to derive detailed predictions for the problem
of estimating a rank-one matrix in noise. Special cases of this problem are
closely related---via universality arguments---to the network community
detection problem for two asymmetric communities. For general rank-one models,
we show that AMP can be used to construct confidence intervals and control
false discovery rate. We provide illustrations of the general methodology by
considering the cases of sparse low-rank matrices and of block-constant
low-rank matrices with symmetric blocks (we refer to the latter as to the
`Gaussian Block Model').

computation intensive tasks from resource constrained mobile devices to fog
nodes or the remote cloud, the energy of mobile devices can be saved and the
computation capability can be enhanced. For fog nodes, they can rent the
resource rich remote cloud to help them process incoming tasks from mobile
devices. In this architecture, the benefit of short computation and computation
delay of mobile devices can be fully exploited. However, existing studies
mostly assume fog nodes possess unlimited computing capacity, which is not
practical, especially when fog nodes are also energy constrained mobile
devices. To provide incentive of fog nodes and reduce the computation cost of
mobile devices, we provide a cost effective offloading scheme in mobile edge
computing with the cooperation between fog nodes and the remote cloud with task

determine which task should be computed locally or sent to the fog. To address
this issue, we first formulate the offloading problem as a task finish time
inimization problem with given budgets of mobile devices, which is NP-hard. We
then devise two more algorithms to study the network performance. Simulation
results show that the proposed greedy algorithm can achieve the near optimal
performance. On average, the Brute Force method and the greedy algorithm
outperform the simulated annealing algorithm by about 28.13% on the application

computational methods to determine the authors of disputed texts. Disputed
authorship is a common problem in Classics, since little information about
ancient documents has survived the centuries. Many scholars have questioned the
authenticity of the final chapter of Xenophon's Cyropaedia, a 4th century B.C.
historical text. In this study, we use N-grams frequency vectors with a cosine
similarity function and word frequency vectors with Naive Bayes Classifiers
(NBC) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze the authorship of the
Cyropaedia. Although the N-gram analysis shows that the epilogue of the
Cyropaedia differs slightly from the rest of the work, comparing the analysis
of Xenophon with analyses of Aristotle and Plato suggests that this difference
is not significant. Both NBC and SVM analyses of word frequencies show that the
final chapter of the Cyropaedia is closely related to the other chapters of the
Cyropaedia. Therefore, this analysis suggests that the disputed chapter was
written by Xenophon. This information can help scholars better understand the
Cyropaedia and also demonstrates the usefulness of applying modern authorship
analysis techniques to classical literature.

(RRBC) is investigated. In periodic domains with square cross-section in the
horizontal a domain-filling dipole state is present. For rectangular periodic
domains a Kolmogorov-like flow consisting of a periodic array of alternating
unidirectional jets with embedded vortices is observed, together with an
underlying weak meandering transverse jet. Similar transitions occurring in
weakly dissipative two-dimensional flows driven by externally imposed small
amplitude noise as well as in classical hydrostatic geostrophic turbulence are
a consequence of inviscid conservation of energy and potential enstrophy and
can be understood using statistical mechanics considerations. RRBC represents
an important three-dimensional system with only one inviscid invariant that
nonetheless exhibits large-scale structures driven by intrinsically generated
fluctuations.

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNNLncT9XmQ",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of continuous-time trajectory representation has brought
increased accuracy and efficiency to multi-modal sensor fusion in modern SLAM.
However, regardless of these advantages, its offline property caused by the
requirement of global batch optimization is critically hindering its relevance
for real-time and life-long applications. In this paper, we present a dense
map-centric SLAM method based on a continuous-time trajectory to cope with this
problem. The proposed system locally functions in a similar fashion to
conventional Continuous-Time SLAM (CT-SLAM). However, it removes the need for
global trajectory optimization by introducing map deformation. The
computational complexity of the proposed approach for loop closure does not
depend on the operation time, but only on the size of the space it explored
before the loop closure. It is therefore more suitable for long term operation
compared to the conventional CT-SLAM. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces
uncertainty in the reconstructed dense map by using probabilistic surface
element (surfel) fusion. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces
globally consistent maps without global batch trajectory optimization, and
effectively reduces LiDAR noise by surfel fusion.

(J=1-0) data covering a 1.4x1.0 degree region of W51A obtained with the

~30 pc and 1.0-1.9x10^5 Msun. Toward the central part of the HII region complex
G49.5-0.4, we identified four C18O clumps having sizes of ~1 pc and column
densities of higher than 10^23 cm^-3, which are each embedded within the four
velocity clouds. These four clumps are distributed close to each others within
a small distance of 5 pc, showing a complementary distribution on the sky. In
the position-velocity diagram, these clumps are connected with each others by
bridge features with intermediate intensities. The high intensity ratios of
13CO (J=3-2/J=1-0) also indicates that these four clouds are associated with
the HII regions. We also found these features in other HII regions in W51A. The
timescales of the collisions are estimated to be several 0.1 Myrs as a crossing
time of the clouds, which are consistent with the ages of the HII regions
measured from the size of the HII regions in the 21 cm continuum emissions. We
discuss the cloud-cloud collision scenario and massive star formation in W51A

advection-diffusion equation on a bounded domain, using time- and
space-dependent velocity fields as the control parameters. This partial
differential equation (PDE) is the Kolmogorov forward equation for a reflected
diffusion process that models the spatiotemporal evolution of a swarm of
agents. We prove that if a target probability density has bounded first-order
weak derivatives and is uniformly bounded from below by a positive constant,
then it can be reached in finite time using control inputs that are bounded in
space and time. We then extend this controllability result to a class of
advection-diffusion-reaction PDEs that corresponds to a hybrid-switching
diffusion process (HSDP), in which case the reaction parameters are
additionally incorporated as the control inputs. Our proof for controllability
of the advection-diffusion equation is constructive and is based on linear
operator semigroup theoretic arguments and spectral properties of the
multiplicatively perturbed Neumann Laplacian. For the HSDP, we first
constructively prove controllability of the associated continuous-time Markov
chain (CTMC) system, in which the state space is finite. Then we show that our
controllability results for the advection-diffusion equation and the CTMC can
be combined to establish controllability of the forward equation of the HSDP.
Lastly, we provide constructive solutions to the problem of asymptotically
stabilizing an HSDP to a target non-negative stationary distribution using
time-independent state feedback laws, which correspond to spatially-dependent
coefficients of the associated system of PDEs.

simulate the fluid-structure interaction of a nonlinear multibody system in an
incompressible turbulent flow. The proposed formulation relies on a
three-dimensional (3D) incompressible turbulent flow solver, a nonlinear
monolithic elastic structural solver for constrained flexible multibody system
and the nonlinear iterative force correction scheme for coupling of the
turbulent fluid-flexible multibody system with nonmatching interface meshes.
While the fluid equations are discretized using a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin
formulation in space and the generalized-$\alpha$ updates in time, the
multibody system utilizes a discontinuous space-time Galerkin finite element
method. We address two key challenges in the present formulation. Firstly, the
coupling of the incompressible turbulent flow with a system of nonlinear
elastic bodies described in a co-rotated frame. Secondly, the projection of the
tractions and displacements across the nonmatching 3D fluid surface elements
and the one-dimensional line elements for the flexible multibody system in a
conservative manner. Through the nonlinear iterative correction and the
conservative projection, the developed fluid-flexible multibody interaction
solver is stable for problems involving strong inertial effects between the
fluid-flexible multibody system and the coupled interactions among each
multibody component. The accuracy of the proposed coupled finite element
framework is validated against the available experimental data for a long
flexible cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibration in a uniform current flow
condition. Finally, a practical application of the proposed framework is
demonstrated by simulating the flow-induced vibration of a realistic offshore
floating platform connected to a long riser and an elastic mooring system.

set of vertices reachable from a designated source vertex. This problem can be
solved easily sequentially by performing a graph search, but efficient parallel
algorithms have eluded researchers for decades. For sparse high-diameter graphs
in particular, there is no known work-efficient parallel algorithm with
nontrivial parallelism. This amounts to one of the most fundamental open
questions in parallel graph algorithms: Is there a parallel algorithm for
digraph reachability with nearly linear work? This paper shows that the answer
is yes.
  This paper presents a randomized parallel algorithm for digraph reachability
and related problems with expected work $\tilde{O}(m)$ and span
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$, and hence parallelism $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$, on any
graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs. This is the first parallel algorithm
having both nearly linear work and strongly sublinear span. The algorithm can
be extended to produce a directed spanning tree, determine whether the graph is
acyclic, topologically sort the strongly connected components of the graph, or
produce a directed ear decomposition of a strongly connected graph, all with
similar work and span.
  The main technical contribution is an \emph{efficient} Monte Carlo algorithm
that, through the addition of $\tilde{O}(n)$ shortcuts, reduces the diameter of
the graph to $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ with high probability. While both sequential
and parallel algorithms are known with those combinatorial properties, even the
sequential algorithms are not efficient. This paper presents a surprisingly
simple sequential algorithm that achieves the stated diameter reduction and
runs in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Parallelizing that algorithm yields the main
result, but doing so involves overcoming several other challenges.

power systems in recent years, where a large area is decomposed into smaller
control regions each solving a local optimization problem with periodic
information exchange with neighboring regions. However, most distributed
optimization methods are iterative and require synchronization of all regions
at each iteration, which is hard to achieve without a centralized coordinator
and might lead to under-utilization of computation resources due to the
heterogeneity of the regions. To address such limitations of synchronous
schemes, this paper investigates the applicability of asynchronous distributed
optimization methods to power system optimization. Particularly, we focus on
solving the AC Optimal Power Flow problem and propose an algorithmic framework
based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method that
allows the regions to perform local updates with information received from a
subset of but not all neighbors. Through experimental studies, we demonstrate
that the convergence performance of the proposed asynchronous scheme is
dependent on the communication delay of passing messages among the regions.
Under mild communication delays, the proposed scheme can achieve comparable or
even faster convergence compared with its synchronous counterpart, which can be
used as a good alternative to centralized or synchronous distributed
optimization approaches.

quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics (QM/MM MD) provides an
approach to calculate entropic contribution in condensed phase reactions.
Complete reaction pathway is exploited by QM/MM MD simulations at DFT and
SCC-DFTB levels. The overall entropy change calculated at SCC-DFTB level QM/MM
MD simulations, is close agreement with the experimental value. Conformation
analysis indicates that the self-ordering of chorismate in the active site of

conformational transformation entropy and activation entropy cannot be
intuitively speculated from the crystal structure that only acts as a
stationary state along the reaction pathway of PchB catalyzed reaction. This is
the first time to use QM/MM MD simulations to calculate the activation entropy

investigation of natural biases stemming from algorithmic rules may shed light

However, most known topological insulator materials naturally contain spinful

breaks time-reversal symmetry, removing the topological protection and enabling
the buildup of dynamic nuclear spin polarization through hyperfine-assisted
backscattering. Here, we calculate scattering probabilities and nuclear
polarization for edge channels containing up to $34$ nuclear spins using a
numerically exact analysis that exploits the symmetries of the problem to
drastically reduce the computational complexity. We then show the emergence of

the foliations induced by a collection of closed 1-forms in a compact manifold
$M$. Equivalently, this is to the study of the level sets of multivalued
functions on $M$. To date, this problem was thoroughly investigated only for
$M=\Bbb T^n$ and multivalued maps $F:\Bbb T^n\to\Bbb R^{n-1}$ in three
different particular cases: when all components of $F$ but one are multivalued,
started by Novikov in 1981, when all components of $F$ but one are
singlevalued, started by Zorich in 1994, when none of the components is
singlevalued, started by Arnold in 1991. The first two problems can be
formulated as the study of the level sets of certain quasiperiodic functions,
the last as level sets of pseudoperiodic functions. In this survey we present
the main analytical and numerical results to date and some physical phenomena
where they play a fundamental role.

information along the trajectory of a meteoroid that is transiting our

can be estimated using Bayesian filtering techniques. A particle filter is a
novel approach to modelling the uncertainty in meteoroid trajectories and
incorporates errors in initial parameters, the dynamical model used and
observed position measurements. Unlike other stochastic approaches, a particle
filter does not require predefined values for initial conditions or
unobservable trajectory parameters. The Bunburra Rockhole fireball (Spurn\'y et
al. 2012), observed by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN) in 2007, is
used to determine the effectiveness of a particle filter for use in fireball
trajectory modelling. The final mass is determined to be $2.16\pm1.33\, kg$
with a final velocity of $6030\pm216\, m\,s^{-1}$, similar to previously
calculated values. The full automatability of this approach will allow an
unbiased evaluation of all events observed by the DFN and lead to a better

Dwarf Nova outburst in 2015 March--April. The object was observed with {\sl
NuSTAR} during the outburst state, and again in a quiescent state wherein the
15--50 keV flux was 33 times lower. Using a multi-temperature plasma emission
and reflection model, the highest plasma temperature in the accretion column
was measured as $19.7^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$~keV in outburst and
$36.2^{+3.5}_{-3.2}$~keV in quiescence. The significant change of the maximum
temperature is considered to reflect an accretion-induced decrease of the
inner-disk radius $R_{\rm in}$, where accreting gas is captured by the
magnetosphere. Assuming this radius scales as $R_{\rm in} \propto
\dot{M}^{-2/7}$ where $\dot{M}$ is the mass accretion rate, we obtain $R_{\rm
in} = 1.9 ^{+0.4}_{-0.2}~R_{\rm WD}$ and $R_{\rm in} = 7.4^{+2.1}_{-1.2}~R_{\rm

white-dwarf radius of this system. Utilising the measured temperatures and
fluxes, as well as the standard mass-radius relation of white dwarfs, we
estimate the white-dwarf mass as $M_{\rm WD} = 0.87~\pm~0.08~M_{\rm \odot}$
including typical systematic uncertainties by 7%. The surface magnetic field is
also measured as $B \sim 5 \times 10^{5}$~G. These results exemplify a new

counting dimensions a natural conjecture is that such a curve exists if and
only if \[n \leq \left\lfloor \frac{(r + 1)d - (r - 3)(g - 1)}{r -

the above conjecture was recently shown to hold with exactly three exceptions.
In this paper, we prove a ""bounded-error analog"" for special linear series on
general curves; more precisely we show that existance of such a curve subject
to the stronger inequality \[n \leq \left\lfloor \frac{(r + 1)d - (r - 3)(g -

without introducing exceptions (as a canonical curve in P^3 can only pass
through 9 general points, while a naive dimension count predicts 12). We also
use the same technique to prove that the twist of the normal bundle N_C(-1)
satisfies interpolation for curves whose degree is sufficiently large relative
to their genus, and deduce from this that the number of general points
contained in the hyperplane section of a general curve is at least

explained under the perspective of game theory, wherein two involving parties
are a discriminator and a generator. In this game, the task of the
discriminator is to discriminate the real and generated (i.e., fake) data,
whilst the task of the generator is to generate the fake data that maximally
confuses the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint for GANs,
which is termed as the minimizing general loss viewpoint. This viewpoint shows
a connection between the general loss of a classification problem regarding a
convex loss function and a f-divergence between the true and fake data
distributions. Mathematically, we proposed a setting for the classification
problem of the true and fake data, wherein we can prove that the general loss
of this classification problem is exactly the negative f-divergence for a
certain convex function f. This allows us to interpret the problem of learning
the generator for dismissing the f-divergence between the true and fake data
distributions as that of maximizing the general loss which is equivalent to the
min-max problem in GAN if the Logistic loss is used in the classification
problem. However, this viewpoint strengthens GANs in two ways. First, it allows
us to employ any convex loss function for the discriminator. Second, it
suggests that rather than limiting ourselves in NN-based discriminators, we can
alternatively utilize other powerful families. Bearing this viewpoint, we then
propose using the kernel-based family for discriminators. This family has two
appealing features: i) a powerful capacity in classifying non-linear nature
data and ii) being convex in the feature space. Using the convexity of this
family, we can further develop Fenchel duality to equivalently transform the
max-min problem to the max-max dual problem.

investigating the structure of the flow diagrams of the evolution equations,

stable fixed points. We obtain the attractors of anisotropic hydrodynamics,
Israel-Stewart (IS) and transient fluid (DNMR) theories and show that they are
indeed non-planar and the basin of attraction is essentially three dimensional.
The attractors of each hydrodynamical model are compared with the one obtained
from the exact Gubser solution of the Boltzmann equation within the relaxation

match up to high numerical accuracy the attractor of the exact solution while
the second order hydrodynamical theories fail to describe it. We show that the
IS and DNMR asymptotic series expansion diverge and use resurgence techniques

link between the manifold of steepest descent paths in path integrals and basin
of attraction for the attractors via Lyapunov functions that opens a new

Based on the deep MUSE spectroscopy and ancillary Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
photometry data, we carefully measured EW values taking into account extended
Ly$\alpha$ emission and UV continuum slopes ($\beta$). Our LAEs reach
unprecedented depths, both in Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and UV absolute
magnitudes, from log($L_{\rm Ly\alpha}$/erg s$^{-1}$) $\sim$41.0 to 43.0 and
from Muv $\sim$ -16 to -21 (0.01-1.0 $L^{*}_{\rm z=3}$). The EW values span the
range of $\sim$ 5 to 240 \AA\ or larger, and their distribution can be well
fitted by an exponential law $N = N_{\rm 0}$ exp($-$EW/$w_{\rm 0}$). Owing to
the high dynamic range in Muv, we find that the scale factor, $w_{\rm 0}$,
depends on Muv in the sense that including fainter Muv objects increases
$w_{\rm 0}$, i.e., the Ando effect. The results indicate that selection
functions affect the EW scale factor. Taking these effects into account, we
find that our $w_{\rm 0}$ values are consistent with those in the literature
within $1\sigma$ uncertainties at $2.9 < z < 6.6$ at a given threshold of Muv
and $L_{\rm Ly\alpha}$. Interestingly, we find 12 objects with EW $>200$ \AA\
above $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Two of these 12 LAEs show signatures of merger
or AGN activity: the weak CIV $\lambda 1549$ emission line. For the remaining
10 very large EW LAEs, we find that the EW values can be reproduced by young
stellar ages ($< 100$ Myr) and low metallicities ($\lesssim 0.02$ $Z_{\rm
\odot}$). Otherwise, at least part of the Ly$\alpha$ emission in these LAEs
needs to arise from anisotropic radiative transfer effects, fluorescence by
hidden AGN or quasi-stellar object activity, or gravitational cooling.

X-ray source with nH ~4e23 cm-2 but also hinted at the possible presence of a
Compton thick AGN in the N nucleus, where a black hole of 10^9 Msun is inferred
from the ionized gas kinematics. The intrinsic X-ray spectral slope recently
measured by NuSTAR is unusually hard (photon index of ~1.3) for a Seyfert
nucleus, for which we seek an alternative explanation. We hypothesise a
strongly absorbed X-ray source in N, of which X-ray emission rises steeply
above 10 keV, in addition to the known X-ray source in SW, and test it against
the NuSTAR data, assuming the standard spectral slope (photon index of 1.9).
This double X-ray source model gives a good explanation of the hard continuum
spectrum, the deep Fe K absorption edge, and the strong Fe K line observed in
this ULIRG, without invoking the unusual spectral slope required for a single
source interpretation. The putative X-ray source in N is found to be absorbed
by nH = 1.4(+0.7/-0.4)e24 cm-2. The estimated 2-10 keV luminosity of the N
source is 1.3e43 erg/s, about a factor of 2 larger than that of SW during the
NuSTAR observation. Uncorrelated variability above and below 10 keV between the
Suzaku and NuSTAR observations appears to support the double source
interpretation. Variability in spectral hardness and Fe K line flux between the
previous X-ray observations is also consistent with this picture.

learning input-output data, but by learning algorithms through a solving
procedure that obtains the output as a sequence of tasks for a given input

addition and multiplication, but also the algorithms of complicated problems,

this, the LSP neural network structure consists of a deep neural network and
long short-term memory, which are recursively combined. Through

e^+e^-e^-$, has been investigated as a reaction where a dark photon, $A'$, is
produced as a virtual state with subsequent decay into a $e^+e^-$-pair. This
effect arises due to the so-called kinetic mixing and is characterized by the
small parameter $\epsilon$ describing the coupling strength relative to the
electric charge e.
  The search of $A'$ in this process has advantage because the background to
the $A'$ signal is pure QED. This QED background is described by eight Feynman
diagrams taking into account the identity of final electrons. As concern $A'$,
we leave its contribution in Compton-like diagrams only since, in this case,
the virtual dark photon is time-like and its propagator has the Breit-Wigner
form. So, near the resonance $A'$ can manifest itself. The contribution of $A'$
in Borsellino diagrams is negligible since, in this case, the virtual dark
photon is space-like, the $A'$ propagator does not peak and effect is
proportional at least to $\epsilon^2$. We calculate the distributions over the
invariant masses of the both produced $e^+e^-$ pairs and search for the
kinematical region where the Compton-like diagrams contribution is not
suppressed as compared with the Borsellino one. We estimate what value of the
parameter $\epsilon$, as a function of the dark photon mass, can be obtained at
given number of the measured events.

the electronic Hamiltonian confined to a specific Landau level, and its
interplay with the formation of composite fermions has attracted much attention
of late. This article investigates an emergent symmetry in the fractional
quantum Hall effect, namely the PH symmetry of {\em composite fermions}, which
relates states at composite fermion filling factors $\nu^*=n+\bar{\nu}$ and
$\nu^*=n+1-\bar{\nu}$, where the integer $n$ is the $\Lambda$ level index and
$0\leq \bar{\nu}\leq 1$. Detailed calculations using the microscopic theory of
composite fermions demonstrate that for low lying $\Lambda$ levels (small $n$):
(i) the 2-body interaction between composite-fermion particles is very similar,
apart from a constant additive term and an overall scale factor, to that
between composite-fermion holes in the same $\Lambda$ level; and (ii) the
3-body interaction for composite fermions is an order of magnitude smaller than
the 2-body interaction. Taken together, these results imply an approximate PH
symmetry for composite fermions in low $\Lambda$ levels, which is also
supported by exact diagonalization studies and available experiments. This
symmetry, which relates states at electron filling factors
$\nu={n+\bar{\nu}\over 2(n+\bar{\nu})\pm 1}$ and $\nu={n+1-\bar{\nu}\over
2(n+1-\bar{\nu})\pm 1}$, is not present in the original Hamiltonian and owes
its existence entirely to the formation of composite fermions. With increasing
$\Lambda$ level index, the 2-body and 3-body pseudopotentials become
comparable, but at the same time they both diminish in magnitude, indicating
that the interaction between composite fermions becomes weak as we approach
$\nu=1/2$.

verify the accuracy of coupled solutions with respect to the available solution

various non-matching grid ratios and quantify the accuracy of CRM for the

with the partitioned NIFC treatment is stable for low solid-to-fluid density

innumerable reports of non-seismic types of earthquake precursory phenomena
that are intermittent and seem not to occur systematically, while associated
reports are not widely accepted by the geoscience community at large because no
one could explain their origins. We review a unifying theory for a solid-state
mechanism, based on decades of research bridging semi-conductor physics,
chemistry and rock physics. A synthesis has emerged that all pre-earthquake
phenomena could trace back to one fundamental physical process: the activation
of electronic charges (electrons and positive holes) in rocks subjected to
ever-increasing tectonic stresses prior to any major seismic activity, via the
rupture of peroxy bonds. In the second part of the review, we critically
examine satellite and ground station data, recorded before past large
earthquakes, as they have been claimed to provide evidence that precursory
signals tend to become measurable days, sometimes weeks before the disasters.
We review some of the various phenomena that can be directly predicted by the
peroxy defect theory , namely, radon gas emanations, corona discharges, thermal
infrared emissions, air ionization, ion and electron content in the ionosphere,
and electro-magnetic anomalies. Our analysis demonstrates the need for further
systematic investigations, in particular with strong continuous statistical
testing of the relevance and confidence of the precursors. Only then, the
scientific community will be able to assess and improve the performance of
earthquake forecasts.

information processing protocols and the investigation of fundamental physics.
For multipartite quantum systems, it is crucial to identify not only the
presence of entanglement but also its detailed structure. This is because in a
generic experimental situation with sufficiently many subsystems involved, the
production of so-called genuine multipartite entanglement remains a formidable
challenge. Consequently, focusing exclusively on the identification of this
strongest type of entanglement may result in an all or nothing situation where
some inherently quantum aspects of the resource are overlooked. On the
contrary, even if the system is not genuinely multipartite entangled, there may
still be many-body entanglement present in the system. An identification of the
entanglement structure may thus provide us with a hint about where
imperfections in the setup may occur, as well as where we can identify groups
of subsystems that can still exhibit strong quantum-information-processing
capabilities. However, there is no known efficient methods to identify the
underlying entanglement structure. Here, we propose two complementary families
of witnesses for the identification of such structures. They are based on the
detection of entanglement intactness and entanglement depth, each requires only
the implementation of solely two local measurements. Our method is also robust
against noises and other imperfections, as reflected by our experimental
implementation of these tools to verify the entanglement structure of five
different eight-photon entangled states. We demonstrate how their entanglement
structure can be precisely and systematically inferred from the experimental
data. In achieving this goal, we also illustrate how the same set of data can
be classically postprocessed to learn the most about the measured system.

fact, ODL has the property to spend a high proportion of time in an optimum
state that maximizes the sum of utility of all players. And the TEL has the
property to spend a high proportion of time in an optimum state that maximizes
the sum of utility of all players if there is a Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE),
otherwise, it spends a high proportion of time in an optimum state that
maximizes a tradeoff between the sum of utility of all players and a predefined
stability function. On the other hand, estimating the mean fraction of time
spent in the optimum state (as well as the mean time duration to reach it) is
challenging due to the high complexity and dimension of the inherent Markov
Chains. In this paper, under some specific system model, an evaluation of the
above performance metrics is provided by proposing an approximation of the
considered Markov chains, which allows overcoming the problem of high

interpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance

that the proposed method is much advantageous for its sign recovery and
achieves almost minimax optimal convergence rate. Synthetic and real data

worked out, using the Newman-Penrose-Unti approach. In that same article, an
expression for the Bondi mass of the isolated system, $M_\Lambda$, for the
$\Lambda>0$ case was proposed. The stipulated mass $M_\Lambda$ would ensure
that in the absence of any incoming gravitational radiation from elsewhere, the
emitted gravitational waves must carry away a positive-definite energy. That
suggested quantity however, introduced a $\Lambda$-correction term to the Bondi
mass $M_B$ (where $M_B$ is the usual Bondi mass for asymptotically flat
spacetimes) which would involve not just information on the state of the system
at that moment, but ostensibly also its past history. In this paper, we derive
the identical mass-loss equation using an integral formula on a hypersurface
formulated by Frauendiener based on the Nester-Witten identity, and argue that
one may adopt a generalisation of the Bondi mass with $\Lambda\in\R$
\emph{without any correction}, viz. $M_\Lambda=M_B$ for any $\Lambda\in\R$.
Furthermore with $M_\Lambda=M_B$, we show that for \emph{purely quadrupole
gravitational waves} given off by the isolated system (i.e. when the ""Bondi

harmonics with spin-weight 2""), the energy carried away is \emph{manifestly
positive-definite} for the $\Lambda>0$ case. For a general $\sigma^o$ having
higher multipole moments, this perspicuous property in the $\Lambda>0$ case
still holds if those $l>2$ contributions are weak --- more precisely, if they

applications. The construction of accurate simulation model for flow in
fractures is challenging due to the high ratios between a fracture's length and

this paper we present a mixed-dimensional Darcy problem able to describe
pressure and Darcy velocity in all the dimensions, i.e. in the rock matrix, in
the fractures, and in their intersections. Moreover, we present a
mixed-dimensional transport problem which, given the Darcy velocity, describes
coupled advection and diffusion of a passive scalar into the fractured porous
media. The approach can handle both conducting and blocking fractures. Our
computational grids are created by coarsening of simplex tessellations that
conform to the fractures surfaces. An accurate choice of the discrete
approximation of the previous model, by virtual finite element and finite
volume, allows us to simulate complex problem with a good balance in term of
accuracy and computational cost. We illustrate the performance of our method by

  Information",,,,,"cs.IT cs.GT math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enhancement of system capacity is one of the objectives of the fifth
generation (5G) networks in which device-to-device (D2D) communications is
anticipated to play a crucial role. This can be achieved by devising efficient
resource allocation strategies for the D2D users. While most of the works in
resource allocation assume full knowledge of the channel states, transmitting
it in every time slot reduces the system throughput due to extra control
overhead and leads to wastage of power. In this paper, we address the problem
of D2D resource allocation with partial channel state information (CSI) at the
base station (BS) and ensure that the interference from the D2D users do not
jeopardize the communications of cellular users (CUs). With partial CSI,
existing algorithms determine the Nash equilibrium in a distributed manner,
whose inefficiency in maximizing the social utility is well known as the
players try to maximize their own utilities. This is the first work in the D2D
resource allocation field in which within a game theoretic framework, an
optimal D2D resource allocation algorithm is proposed which maximizes the
social utility of the D2D players such that a social optimum is attained. Each
D2D player with the help of the BS learns to select the optimal action. We
consider the channel to exhibit path loss. Next, we consider both a slow and
fast fading with CU mobility and propose two heuristic algorithms. We validate
the performance of our proposed algorithms through simulation results.

distributions arrive one by one in a uniformly random order, and an algorithm
must irrevocably pick one of the samples as soon as it arrives. The goal is to
maximize the expected value of the sample picked relative to the expected
maximum of the distributions. This is one of the most simple and fundamental
problems in online decision making that models the process selling one item to
a sequence of costumers. For a closely related problem called the Prophet
Inequality where the order of the random variables is adversarial, it is known
that one can achieve in expectation $1/2$ of the expected maximum, and no
better ratio is possible. For the Prophet Secretary problem, that is, when the
variables arrive in a random order, Esfandiari et al.\ (ESA 2015) showed that
one can actually get $1-1/e$ of the maximum. The $1-1/e$ bound was recently
extended to more general settings (Ehsani et al., 2017). Given these results,

tool wear. Common methodologies for tool condition monitoring still rely on
batch approaches which cannot cope with a fast sampling rate of metal cutting

scratch when dealing with a new set of machining parameters. This paper
presents an online tool condition monitoring approach based on Parsimonious
Ensemble+, pENsemble+. The unique feature of pENsemble+ lies in its highly
flexible principle where both ensemble structure and base-classifier structure
can automatically grow and shrink on the fly based on the characteristics of
data streams. Moreover, the online feature selection scenario is integrated to
actively sample relevant input attributes. The paper presents advancement of a
newly developed ensemble learning algorithm, pENsemble+, where online active
learning scenario is incorporated to reduce operator labelling effort. The
ensemble merging scenario is proposed which allows reduction of ensemble
complexity while retaining its diversity. Experimental studies utilising
real-world manufacturing data streams and comparisons with well known
algorithms were carried out. Furthermore, the efficacy of pENsemble was
examined using benchmark concept drift data streams. It has been found that
pENsemble+ incurs low structural complexity and results in a significant

intracellular calcium concentration is an indirect measurement of neural
activity, computational tools are necessary to infer the true underlying
spiking activity from fluorescence measurements. Bayesian model inversion can
be used to solve this problem, but typically requires either computationally
expensive MCMC sampling, or faster but approximate maximum-a-posteriori
optimization. Here, we introduce a flexible algorithmic framework for fast,
efficient and accurate extraction of neural spikes from imaging data. Using the
framework of variational autoencoders, we propose to amortize inference by
training a deep neural network to perform model inversion efficiently. The
recognition network is trained to produce samples from the posterior
distribution over spike trains. Once trained, performing inference amounts to a
fast single forward pass through the network, without the need for iterative
optimization or sampling. We show that amortization can be applied flexibly to
a wide range of nonlinear generative models and significantly improves upon the
state of the art in computation time, while achieving competitive accuracy. Our
framework is also able to represent posterior distributions over spike-trains.
We demonstrate the generality of our method by proposing the first
probabilistic approach for separating backpropagating action potentials from
putative synaptic inputs in calcium imaging of dendritic spines.

fermions in 2D lattices. The optical lattice potential manifests itself in an
interplay between an increase in the density of states on the Fermi surface and
the modification of the fermion-fermion interaction (scattering) amplitude. The
density of states is enhanced due to an increase of the effective mass of
atoms. In deep lattices, for short-range interacting atoms, the scattering
amplitude is strongly reduced compared to free space due to a small overlap of
wavefunctions of fermions sitting in the neighboring lattice sites, which
suppresses the $p$-wave superfluidity. However, we show that for a moderate
lattice depth there is still a possibility to create atomic $p$-wave
superfluids with sizable transition temperatures. The situation is drastically
different for fermionic polar molecules. Being dressed with a microwave field,
they acquire a dipole-dipole attractive tail in the interaction potential.
Then, due to a long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction, the
effect of the suppression of the scattering amplitude in 2D lattices is absent.
This leads to the emergence of a stable topological $p_x+ip_y$ superfluid of
identical microwave-dressed polar molecules.

of the small flow-time expansion and the extraction of the $\Lambda$-parameter
from the static force at small distances. For the latter, significant
deviations from the 4-loop perturbative $\beta$-function are visible at

computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can
quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We
propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference
approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform
full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent
advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the
observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a
Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple
rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the
simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant
features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach
efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth
parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover
multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield
model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our
approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex
neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the
gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.

a graph problem $\Pi$ in which a solution can be verified by checking all

that a solution can be computed so that each node chooses its own output based
on its radius-$T$ neighbourhood. Here $T$ is the distributed time complexity of
$\Pi$.
  The time complexity classes for deterministic algorithms in bounded-degree
graphs that are known to exist by prior work are $\Theta(1)$, $\Theta(\log^*
n)$, $\Theta(\log n)$, $\Theta(n^{1/k})$, and $\Theta(n)$. It is also known
that there are two gaps: one between $\omega(1)$ and $o(\log \log^* n)$, and
another between $\omega(\log^* n)$ and $o(\log n)$. It has been conjectured
that many more gaps exist, and that the overall time hierarchy is relatively
simple -- indeed, this is known to be the case in restricted graph families
such as cycles and grids.
  We show that the picture is much more diverse than previously expected. We
present a general technique for engineering LCL problems with numerous
different deterministic time complexities, including $\Theta(\log^{\alpha}n)$

quality binaural sound synthesis systems. Conventionally, minimum phase HRTF
model development for reconstruction of HRTFs has been limited to minimum
phase-pure delay models which ignore the all pass component of the HRTF. In
this paper, a novel method for minimum phase HRTF modelling of Pinna Spectral
Notches (PSNs) using group delay decomposition is proposed. The proposed model
captures the PSNs contributed by both the minimum phase and all pass component
of HRTF thus facilitating an accurate reconstruction of HRTFs. The purely
minimum phase HRTF components and their corresponding spatial angles are first
identified using Fourier Bessel Series method that ensures a continuous
evolution of the PSNs. The minimum phase-pure delay model is used to
reconstruct HRTF for these spatial angles. Subsequently, the spatial angles
which require both the minimum phase and all pass components are modelled using
an all-pass filter cascaded with minimum-phase pure-delay model. Performance of
the proposed model is evaluated by conducting experiments on PSN extraction,
cross coherence analysis, and binaural synthesis. Both objective and subjective
evaluation results are used to indicate the significance of the proposed model
in binaural sound synthesis.

singular values of random matrix products. In this paper we study such
processes where the products of up to $m$ complex random matrices are no longer
independent, by introducing a coupling term and potentials for each product. We
show that such a process still forms a multi-level determinantal point
processes, and give formulae for the relevant correlation functions in terms of
the corresponding kernels.
  For a special choice of potential, leading to a Gaussian coupling between the
$m$th matrix and the product of all previous $m-1$ matrices, we derive a
contour integral representation for the correlation kernels suitable for an
asymptotic analysis of large matrix size $n$. Here, the correlations between
the first $m-1$ levels equal that of the product of $m-1$ independent matrices,
whereas all correlations with the $m$th level are modified. In the hard edge
scaling limit at the origin of the spectra of all products we find three
different asymptotic regimes. The first regime corresponding to weak coupling
agrees with the multi-level process for the product of $m$ independent complex
Gaussian matrices for all levels, including the $m$-th. This process was
introduced by one of the authors and can be understood as a multi-level
extension of the Meijer $G$-kernel introduced by Kuijlaars and Zhang. In the
second asymptotic regime at strong coupling the point process on level $m$
collapses onto level $m-1$, thus leading to the process of $m-1$ independent
matrices. Finally, in an intermediate regime where the coupling is proportional
to $n^{\frac12}$, we obtain a family of parameter dependent kernels,
interpolating between the limiting processes in the weak and strong coupling
regime. These findings generalise previous results of the authors and their
coworkers for $m=2$.

transmission is suspended if the instantaneous received signal-to-noise ratio

transmission in the NOFT scheme. We investigate the optimal design of the
linear multiple network in terms of the optimal rate parameters of the wiretap
code as well as the optimal number of hops. These design parameters are highly
interrelated since more hops reduces the distance of per-hop communication

out DWS measurements, one first needs to quantify the static optical properties
of the sample under investigation, i.e. the transport mean free path $l^\ast$
and the absorption length $l_a$. In the absence of absorption this can be done
by comparing the diffuse optical transmission to a calibration sample whose
$l^\ast$ is known. Performing this comparison however is cumbersome, time
consuming and prone to mistakes by the operator. Moreover, already weak
absorption can lead to significant errors. In this paper, we demonstrate the
implementation of an automatized approach, based on which the DWS measurement

energies, calculated from the non-local HAL QCD potential do not depend on the
sink operators used to define the potential. This is called the scheme
independence of the HAL QCD method. In practical applications, the derivative
expansion of the non-local potential is employed, so that physical observables
may receive some scheme dependence at given order of the expansion. In this
paper, we compare the $I=2$ $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shifts obtained in the
point-sink scheme (the standard scheme in the HAL QCD method) and the
smeared-sink scheme (the LapH smearing newly introduced in the HAL QCD method).
Although potentials in different schemes have different forms as expected, we
find that, for reasonably small smearing size, the resultant scattering phase
shifts agree with each other if the next-to-leading order (NLO) term is taken
into account. We also find that the HAL QCD potential in the point-sink scheme
has negligible NLO term for wide range of energies, which implies a good
convergence of the derivative expansion in this case, while the potential in
the smeared-sink scheme has non-negligible NLO contribution. Implication of
this observation to the future studies of resonance channels (such as the $I=0$
and $1$ $\pi\pi$ scatterings) with smeared all-to-all propagators is briefly
discussed. All computations in this paper have been performed at the lattice

Distribution of entangled photons between the ground and the satellite can be

ground, the space segments contains only the less complex detection system,
enabling its implementation in a compact enclosure, compatible with the 12U

usually based on identifying the most influential nodes. Knowledge of these
nodes can be used for the targeted control of dynamics such as epidemics, or
for modifying biochemical pathways relating to diseases. Similarly they are
valuable for identifying points of failure to increase network resilience in,
for example, social support networks and logistics networks. Many measures,
often termed `centrality', have been constructed to achieve these aims. Here we
consider Katz centrality and provide a new interpretation as a steady-state
solution to continuous-time dynamics. This enables us to implement a
sensitivity analysis which is similar to metabolic control analysis used in the
analysis of biochemical pathways. The results yield a centrality which
quantifies, for each node, the net impact of its absence from the network. It
also has the desirable property of requiring a node with a high centrality to
play a central role in propagating the dynamics of the system by having the
capacity to both receive flux from others and then to pass it on. This new
perspective on Katz centrality is important for a more comprehensive analysis
of directed networks.

against slowly rotating targets and those with low lightcurve amplitudes. As a
consequence of these selection effects, the current picture of asteroid spin
axis distribution, rotation rates, or radiometric properties, might be affected
too.
  To counteract these selection effects, we are running a photometric campaign
of a large sample of main belt asteroids omitted in most previous studies. We
determined synodic rotation periods and verified previous determinations. When
a dataset for a given target was sufficiently large and varied, we performed
spin and shape modelling with two different methods.
  We used the convex inversion method and the non-convex SAGE algorithm,
applied on the same datasets of dense lightcurves. Unlike convex inversion, the
SAGE method allows for the existence of valleys and indentations on the shapes
based only on lightcurves.
  We obtained detailed spin and shape models for the first five targets of our
sample: (159) Aemilia, (227) Philosophia, (329) Svea, (478) Tergeste, and (487)
Venetia. When compared to stellar occultation chords, our models obtained an
absolute size scale and major topographic features of the shape models were
also confirmed. When applied to thermophysical modelling, they provided a very
good fit to the infrared data and allowed their size, albedo, and thermal
inertia to be determined.
  Convex and non-convex shape models provide comparable fits to lightcurves.
However, some non-convex models fit notably better to stellar occultation
chords and to infrared data in sophisticated thermophysical modelling (TPM). In
some cases TPM showed strong preference for one of the spin and shape
solutions. Also, we confirmed that slowly rotating asteroids tend to have
higher-than-average values of thermal inertia.

discrete weak form of boundary operators associated with the Laplace and the
Helmholtz equation in three space dimensions. The method is based on offloading
the CPU assembly of elements during the ACA assembly onto a GPU device and to
use threading strategies across ACA blocks to create sufficient workload for
the GPU. The proposed GPU strategy is designed such that it can be implemented
in existing code with minimal changes to the surrounding application structure.
This is in particular interesting for existing legacy code that is not from the
ground-up designed with GPU computing in mind. Our benchmark study gives
realistic impressions of the benefits of GPU-accelerated BEM simulations by
using state-of-the-art multi-threaded computations on modern high-performance
CPUs as a reference, rather than drawing synthetic comparisons with
single-threaded codes. Speed-up plots illustrate that performance gains up to a
factor of 5.5 could be realized with GPU computing under these conditions. This
refers to a boundary element model with about 4 million unknowns, whose
H-Matrix weak form associated with a real-valued (Laplace) boundary operator is
set up in only 100 minutes harnessing the two GPUs instead of 9 hours when
using the 20 CPU cores at disposal only. The benchmark study is followed by a
particularly demanding real-life application, where we compute the scattered
high-frequency sound field of a submarine to demonstrate the increase in

its multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterparts first enables human to
witness a definite merger event of two neutron stars (NSs). This historical
event confirms the origin of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and in
particular, identifies the theoretically-predicted kilonova phenomenon that is
powered by radioactive decays of $r$-process heavy elements. However, whether a
long-lived remnant NS could be formed during this merger event remains unknown,
although such a central engine has been suggested by afterglow observations of
some short-duration GRBs. By invoking this long-lived remnant NS, we here
propose a model of hybrid energy sources for the kilonova AT2017gfo associated
with GW 170817. While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered
radioactively as usually suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by
delayed energy injection from the remnant NS. In our model, only one single
opacity is required and an intermediate value of $\kappa\simeq0.97\,\rm
cm^2g^{-1}$ is revealed, which could be naturally provided by lanthanide-rich
ejecta that is deeply ionized by the emission from a wind of the NS. These
self-consistent results indicate that a long-lived remnant NS, which must own a
very stiff equation of state, had been formed during the merger event of
GW170817. This provides a very stringent constraint on the strong interaction
in nuclear-quark matter. It is further implied that such GW events could
provide a probe of the early spin and magnetic evolutions of NSs, e.g., the
burying of surface magnetic fields.

1940s and is an important problem in circuit design. Our main lower-bound
result unconditionally shows the existence of functions whose circuit
complexity is polynomially bounded while every hazard-free implementation is
provably of exponential size. Previous lower bounds on the hazard-free
complexity were only valid for depth 2 circuits. The same proof method yields
that every subcubic implementation of Boolean matrix multiplication must have
hazards.
  These results follow from a crucial structural insight: Hazard-free
complexity is a natural generalization of monotone complexity to all (not
necessarily monotone) Boolean functions. Thus, we can apply known monotone
complexity lower bounds to find lower bounds on the hazard-free complexity. We
also lift these methods from the monotone setting to prove exponential
hazard-free complexity lower bounds for non-monotone functions.
  As our main upper-bound result we show how to efficiently convert a Boolean
circuit into a bounded-bit hazard-free circuit with only a polynomially large
blow-up in the number of gates. Previously, the best known method yielded
exponentially large circuits in the worst case, so our algorithm gives an
exponential improvement.

axis leads to quasi-periodic modulation in the neutrino signal. Depending on
the observer's viewing angle, the time modulation will be clearly detectable in
IceCube and the future Hyper-Kamiokande. The GW emission is also anisotropic
where the GW signal is emitted, as previously identified, most strongly toward
the equator at rotating core-collapse and bounce, and the non-axisymmetric
instabilities in the postbounce phase lead to stronger GW emission toward the
spin axis. We show that these GW signals can be a target of LIGO-class
detectors for a Galactic event. The origin of the postbounce GW emission
naturally explains why the peak GW frequency is about twice of the neutrino
modulation frequency. We point out that the simultaneous detection of the
rotation-induced neutrino and GW signatures could provide a smoking-gun

calculations on large graphs that need to be partitioned on heterogeneous

in isolation. Each device has to select the next graph vertex to be executed,
i.e., perform local scheduling decisions. Both problems, partitioning and
scheduling, are NP-complete by themselves but have to be solved in combination
in order to minimize overall execution time of an iteration. In this paper, we
propose several heuristic strategies to solve the partitioning and scheduling
problem in TensorFlow. We simulate the performance of the proposed strategies
in heterogeneous environments with communication-intensive workloads that are
common to TensorFlow. Our findings indicate that the best partitioning and
scheduling heuristics are those that focus on minimizing the execution time of
the critical path in the graph. Those strategies provide a speed-up of up to 4
times in comparison to strategies that are agnostic to the critical path, such

asymmetrical mass distributions evolve under their self-gravity to produce a
quasi-planar spiral structure surrounding a virialized core, qualitatively
resembling a spiral galaxy. The spiral structure is transient, but can survive
tens of dynamical times, and further reproduces qualitatively noted features of
spiral galaxies as the predominance of trailing two-armed spirals and large
pitch angles. As our models are highly idealized, a detailed comparison with
observations is not appropriate, but generic features of the velocity
distributions can be identified to be potential observational signatures of
such a mechanism. Indeed, the mechanism leads generically to a characteristic
transition from predominantly rotational motion, in a region outside the core,
to radial ballistic motion in the outermost parts. Such radial motions are
excluded in our Galaxy up to 15 kpc, but could be detected at larger scales in
the future by GAIA. We explore the apparent motions seen by external observers
of the velocity distributions of our toy galaxies, and find that it is
difficult to distinguish them from those of a rotating disc with sub-dominant
radial motions at levels typically inferred from observations. These simple
models illustrate the possibility that the observed apparent motions of spiral
galaxies might be explained by non-trivial non-stationary mass and velocity
distributions without invoking a dark matter halo or modification of Newtonian
gravity. In this scenario the observed phenomenological relation between the
centripetal and gravitational acceleration of the visible baryonic mass could
have a simple explanation.

the quark rearrangement process, one could obtain the reasonable ratio of

distributions in the $B\rightarrow \bar D D^* K$ decays could be understood
qualitatively at the same time. This scheme may provide more insight to
understand the enigmatic nature of the $X(3872)$ state.

most significant transformation seen in decades. However, as modern vehicles
become more connected, they also become much more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
In this paper, a fully working machine learning approach is proposed to protect
connected vehicles (fleets and individuals) against such attacks. We present a
system that monitors different vehicle's interfaces (Network, CAN and OS),
extracts relevant information based on configurable rules and sends it to a
trained generative model to detect deviations from normal behavior. Using
configurable data collector, we provide a higher level of data abstraction as
the model is trained based on events instead of raw data, which has a
noise-filtering effect and eliminates the need to retrain the model whenever a
protocol changes. We present a new approach for detecting anomalies, tailored
to the temporal nature of our domain. Adapting the hybrid approach of Gutflaish
et al. (2017) to the fully temporal setting, we first train a Hidden Markov
Model to learn normal vehicle behavior, and then a regression model to
calibrate the likelihood threshold for anomaly. Using this architecture, our
method detects sophisticated and realistic anomalies, which are missed by other
existing methods monitoring the CAN bus only. We also demonstrate the
superiority of adaptive thresholds over static ones. Furthermore, our approach
scales efficiently from monitoring individual cars to serving large fleets. We
demonstrate the competitive advantage of our model via encouraging empirical

a strong magnetic field and slow spin. Here, we present the discovery of radio
emission from Her X-1 with the Very Large Array. During the radio observation,
the central X-ray source was partially obscured by a warped disk. We measure a
radio flux density of $38.7 \pm 4.8$ $\mu$Jy at $9$ GHz but can not constrain
the spectral shape. We discuss possible origins of the radio emission, and
conclude that coherent emission, a stellar wind, shocks and a propeller outflow
are all unlikely explanations. A jet, as seen in LMXBs, is consistent with the
observed radio properties. We consider the implications of the presence of a
jet in Her X-1 on jet formation mechanisms and on the launcing of jets by
neutron stars with strong magnetic fields.

  will appear in STOC 2018",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Ordered k-Median problem, in which the solution is evaluated by
first sorting the client connection costs and then multiplying them with a
predefined non-increasing weight vector (higher connection costs are taken with
larger weights). Since the 1990s, this problem has been studied extensively in
the discrete optimization and operations research communities and has emerged
as a framework unifying many fundamental clustering and location problems such
as k-Median and k-Center. This generality, however, renders the problem
intriguing from the algorithmic perspective and obtaining non-trivial
approximation algorithms was an open problem even for simple topologies such as
trees. Recently, Aouad and Segev were able to obtain an O(log n) approximation
algorithm for Ordered k-Median using a sophisticated local-search approach and
the concept of surrogate models thereby extending the result by Tamir (2001)
for the case of a rectangular weight vector, also known as k-Facility
p-Centrum.
  In this paper, we provide an LP-rounding constant-factor approximation
algorithm for the Ordered k-Median problem.
  We first provide a new analysis of the rounding process by Charikar and Li
(2012) for k-Median, when applied to a fractional solution obtained from
solving an LP relaxation over a non-metric, truncated cost vector, resulting in
an elegant 15-approximation for the rectangular case. Then, we show that a
simple weight bucketing can be applied to the general case resulting in O(log
n) rectangles and hence in a constant-factor approximation in quasi-polynomial
time. Finally, we show that also the clever distance bucketing by Aouad and
Segev can be combined with the objective-oblivious version of our LP-rounding
for the rectangular case, and that it results in a true, polynomial time,
constant-factor approximation algorithm.

learn relation representations along the SDP extracted from the forest formed
by the structure regularized dependency tree, which benefits reducing the
complexity of the whole model and helps improve the $F_{1}$ score by 10.3.

  arXiv:1709.10190",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work provides a framework for addressing the problem of supervised
domain adaptation with deep models. The main idea is to exploit adversarial
learning to learn an embedded subspace that simultaneously maximizes the
confusion between two domains while semantically aligning their embedding. The
supervised setting becomes attractive especially when there are only a few
target data samples that need to be labeled. In this few-shot learning
scenario, alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is
difficult because of the lack of data. We found that by carefully designing a
training scheme whereby the typical binary adversarial discriminator is
augmented to distinguish between four different classes, it is possible to
effectively address the supervised adaptation problem. In addition, the
approach has a high speed of adaptation, i.e. it requires an extremely low
number of labeled target training samples, even one per category can be
effective. We then extensively compare this approach to the state of the art in
domain adaptation in two experiments: one using datasets for handwritten digit
recognition, and one using datasets for visual object recognition.

clear: it controls the flow of probability. The dynamics is driven by entropy
subject to constraints that capture the relevant physical information. The
central concern is to identify those constraints and how they are updated.
After reviewing previous work I describe how considerations from information
geometry allow us to derive a phase space geometry that combines Riemannian,
symplectic, and complex structures. The ED that preserves these structures is
QM. The full equivalence between ED and QM is achieved by taking account of how
gauge symmetry and charge quantization are intimately related to quantum phases

and urgent problem. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for
analyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to
several small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability
to multi-vehicle trajectory planning is often intractable due to the ""curse of
dimensionality."" To overcome this problem, the sequential trajectory planning
(STP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed, STP
allows multi-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a linearly-scaling
computation complexity. However, if a vehicle not in the set of STP vehicles
enters the system, or even worse, if this vehicle is an adversarial intruder,
the previous formulation requires the entire system to perform replanning, an
intractable task for large-scale systems. In this paper, we make STP more
practical by providing a new algorithm where replanning is only needed only for
a fixed number of vehicles, irrespective of the total number of STP vehicles.
Moreover, this number is a design parameter, which can be chosen based on the
computational resources available during run time. We demonstrate this
algorithm in a representative simulation of an urban airspace environment.

that non-thermal emission could also be present. This additional contribution
from non-thermal emission has been inferred through negative spectral indices
at centimeter wavelengths in some regions of the radio jets. In the case of HH
80-81, one of the most powerful protostellar jets known, linearly polarized
emission has also been detected, revealing that the non-thermal emission is of
synchrotron nature from a population of relativistic particles in the jet. This
result implies that an acceleration mechanism should be taking place in some
parts of the jet. Here, we present new high sensitivity and high angular
resolution radio observations at several wavelengths (in the 3-20 cm range) of
the HH80-81 radio jet. These new observations represent an improvement in
sensitivity and angular resolution by a factor of $\sim$10 with respect to
previous observations. This allows us to resolve the morphology of the radio
jet, and to study the different emission mechanisms involved through spectral
index maps. We conclude that synchrotron emission in this jet arises from an
extended component detected at low frequencies and from the termination points
of the jet, where strong shocks against the ambient medium can produce
efficient particle acceleration.

  Blackout Risk",,,,,"math.OC stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The risk of cascading blackouts greatly relies on failure probabilities of
individual components in power grids. To quantify how component failure
probabilities (CFP) influences blackout risk (BR), this paper proposes a
sample-induced semi-analytic approach to characterize the relationship between
CFP and BR. To this end, we first give a generic component failure probability
function (CoFPF) to describe CFP with varying parameters or forms. Then the
exact relationship between BR and CoFPFs is built on the abstract
Markov-sequence model of cascading outages. Leveraging a set of samples
generated by blackout simulations, we further establish a sample-induced
semi-analytic mapping between the unbiased estimation of BR and CoFPFs.
Finally, we derive an efficient algorithm that can directly calculate the
unbiased estimation of BR when the CoFPFs change. Since no additional
simulations are required, the algorithm is computationally scalable and
efficient. Numerical experiments well confirm the theory and the algorithm.

influence of annealed noise on nonlinear oscillators has been studied
intensively. It can induce effects in nonlinear oscillators not present in the
deterministic setting. Yet, there is no theory regarding the quenched noise
scenario of random parameters sampled on fixed time intervals, although this
situation is often a lot more natural. Here we study a paradigmatic nonlinear
oscillator of van-der-Pol/FitzHugh-Nagumo type under quenched noise as a
piecewise-deterministic Markov process. There are several interesting effects
such as period shifts and new different trapped types of small-amplitude
oscillations, which can be captured analytically. Furthermore, we numerically
discover quenched resonance and show that it differs significantly from
previous finite-noise optimality resonance effects. This demonstrates that
quenched oscillatorscan be viewed as a new building block of nonlinear
dynamics.

that move with very low velocities relative to us but are very distant. We
shall do that by providing a reanalysis of the so-called Andromeda paradox and
by revisiting the standard explanation of the muon lifetime dilation given when
this phenomenon is observed from muon's perspective. Ultimately, we shall show
that if Lorentz transformations (and basically, special relativity) are meant
to entail real physical consequences, then the observable Universe should
appear very differently from what we see every clear night.

  Nonconvex Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distributed computation of equilibria and optima has seen growing
interest in a broad collection of networked problems. We consider the
computation of equilibria of convex stochastic Nash games characterized by a
possibly nonconvex potential function. Our focus is on two classes of
stochastic Nash games: (P1): A potential stochastic Nash game, in which each
player solves a parameterized stochastic convex program; and (P2): A
misspecified generalization, where the player-specific stochastic program is
complicated by a parametric misspecification. In both settings, exact proximal
BR solutions are generally unavailable in finite time since they necessitate
solving parameterized stochastic programs. Consequently, we design two
asynchronous inexact proximal BR schemes to solve the problems, where in each
iteration a single player is randomly chosen to compute an inexact proximal BR
solution with rivals' possibly outdated information. Yet, in the misspecified
regime (P2), each player possesses an extra estimate of the misspecified
parameter and updates its estimate by a projected stochastic gradient (SG)
algorithm. By Since any stationary point of the potential function is a Nash
equilibrium of the associated game, we believe this paper is amongst the first
ones for stochastic nonconvex (but block convex) optimization problems equipped
with almost-sure convergence guarantees. These statements can be extended to
allow for accommodating weighted potential games and generalized potential
games. Finally, we present preliminary numerics based on applying the proposed
schemes to congestion control and Nash-Cournot games.
