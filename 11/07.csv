multi-resource allocation problem with no direct inter-agent communication. We
do so by extending a recently introduced additive-increase
multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm, which only uses very little
communication between the system and agents. Namely, a control unit broadcasts
a one-bit signal to agents whenever one of the allocated resources exceeds
capacity. Agents then respond to this signal in a probabilistic manner. In the
proposed algorithm, each agent is unaware of the resource allocation of other
agents. We also propose a version of the AIMD algorithm for multiple binary
resources (e.g., parking spaces). Binary resources are indivisible unit-demand
resources, and each agent either allocated one unit of the resource or none. In
empirical results, we observe that in both cases, the average allocations
converge over time to optimal allocations.

development to achieve better capabilities including increasing the time and
frequency resolutions of the recorded data, and increasing the receiving and
recording bandwidth. As only a limited spectrum resource has been allocated to
radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union, this results in
the radio observational instrumentation being inevitably exposed to undesirable
radio frequency interference (RFI) signals which originate mainly from
terrestrial human activity and are becoming stronger with time. RFIs degrade
the quality of astronomical data and even lead to data loss. The impact of RFIs
on scientific outcome is becoming progressively difficult to manage. In this
article, we motivate the requirement for RFI mitigation, and review the RFI
characteristics, mitigation techniques and strategies. Mitigation strategies
adopted at some representative observatories, telescopes and arrays are also
introduced. We also discuss and present advantages and shortcomings of the four
classes of RFI mitigation strategies, applicable at the connected causal
stages: preventive, pre-detection, pre-correlation and post-correlation. The
proper identification and flagging of RFI is key to the reduction of data loss
and improvement in data quality, and is also the ultimate goal of developing
RFI mitigation techniques. This can be achieved through a strategy involving a
combination of the discussed techniques in stages. Recent advances in high
speed digital signal processing and high performance computing allow for
performing RFI excision of large data volumes generated from large telescopes
or arrays in both real time and offline modes, aiding the proposed strategy.

$n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$, and a collection $M=\{(s_1,t_1),\ldots,(s_k,t_k)\}$
of pairs of its vertices, called source-destination, or demand pairs. The goal
is to route as many of the demand pairs as possible, where to route a pair we
need to select a path connecting it, so that all selected paths are disjoint in
their vertices. The best current algorithm for NDP achieves an
$O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation, while, until recently, the best negative result
was a factor $\Omega(\log^{1/2-\epsilon}n)$-hardness of approximation, for any
constant $\epsilon$, unless $NP \subseteq ZPTIME(n^{poly \log n})$. In a recent
work, the authors have shown an improved $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$-hardness
of approximation for NDP, unless $NP\subseteq DTIME(n^{O(\log n)})$, even if
the underlying graph is a subgraph of a grid graph, and all source vertices lie
on the boundary of the grid. Unfortunately, this result does not extend to grid

  The approximability of the NDP problem on grid graphs has remained a
tantalizing open question, with the best current upper bound of
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$, and the best current lower bound of APX-hardness. In this
paper we come close to resolving the approximability of NDP in general, and NDP
in grids in particular. Our main result is that NDP is
$2^{\Omega(\log^{1-\epsilon} n)}$-hard to approximate for any constant

is $n^{\Omega (1/(\log \log n)^2)}$-hard to approximate, assuming that for some

DOA estimation using spectral search. Unlike existing methods like Capon or
MUSIC which can be considered as single source approximations of multi-source
estimation criteria, the proposed approach accounts for the existence of
multiple sources. At each considered direction, the manifold structure of the
remaining interfering signals impinging on the sensor array is relaxed, which
results in closed form estimates for the interference parameters. The
conventional multidimensional optimization problem reduces, thanks to this
relaxation, to a simple spectral search. Following this principle, we propose
estimators based on the Deterministic Maximum Likelihood, Weighted Subspace
Fitting and covariance fitting methods. To calculate the pseudo-spectra
efficiently, an iterative rooting scheme based on the rational function
approximation is applied to the partial relaxation methods. Simulation results
show that the performance of the proposed estimators is superior to the
conventional methods especially in the case of low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio and
low number of snapshots, irrespectively of any specific structure of the sensor
array while maintaining a comparable computational cost as MUSIC.

challenging to find important people among all individuals in images directly

diverse variations of pose, action, appearance of persons and various changes
of occasions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing a multiple
Hyper-Interaction Graph to treat each individual in an image as a node and
inferring the most active node referring to interactions estimated by various
types of clews. We model pairwise interactions between persons as the edge
message communicated between nodes, resulting in a bidirectional
pairwise-interaction graph. To enrich the personperson interaction estimation,
we further introduce a unidirectional hyper-interaction graph that models the
consensus of interaction between a focal person and any person in a local
region around. Finally, we modify the PageRank algorithm to infer the
activeness of persons on the multiple Hybrid-Interaction Graph (HIG), the union
of the pairwise-interaction and hyperinteraction graphs, and we call our

evaluation, we have contributed a new dataset called Multi-scene Important

acting on a network can be coarse grained through the use of graph partitions.
Specifically, we are interested in how aggregating the state space of a Markov
process according to a partition impacts on the thus obtained lower-dimensional
dynamics. We highlight that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be
multiple coarse grained descriptions that capture different, incomparable
features of the original process. For instance, a coarse graining induced by
one partition may be commensurate with a time-scale separation in the dynamics,
while another coarse graining may correspond to a different lower-dimensional
dynamics that preserves the Markov property of the original process. Taking
inspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics, we find that a
convenient tool to summarise and visualise such dynamical properties of a
coarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram. The entrogram gathers
certain information-theoretic measures, which quantify how information flows
across time steps. These information theoretic quantities include the entropy
rate, as well as a measure for the memory contained in the process, i.e., how
well the dynamics can be approximated by a first order Markov process. We use
the entrogram to investigate how specific macro-scale connection patterns in
the state-space transition graph of the original dynamics result in desirable
properties of coarse grained descriptions. We thereby provide a fresh
perspective on the interplay between structure and dynamics in networks, and
the process of partitioning from an information theoretic perspective. We focus
on networks that may be approximated by both a core-periphery or a clustered
organization, and highlight that each of these coarse grained descriptions can
capture different aspects of a Markov process acting on the network.

variance of the local energy: extrapolation of these energies to zero variance
gives values in close agreement with the exact values. For two dimensional

Petrov-Galerkin finite element methods. This novel theory is then used to
motivate goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement strategies for use with
discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods. The focus of this article is
mainly on broken ultraweak variational formulations of stationary boundary
value problems, however, many of the ideas presented within are general enough
that they be extended to any such well-posed variational formulation. The
proposed goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement procedures require the
construction of refinement indicators for both a primal problem and a dual
problem. In the DPG context, the primal problem is simply the system of linear
equations coming from a standard DPG method and the dual problem is a similar
system of equations, coming from a new method which is dual to DPG. This new
method has the same coefficient matrix as the associated DPG method but has a
different load. We refer to this new finite element method as a DPG* method. A
thorough analysis of DPG* methods, as stand-alone finite element methods, is
not given here but will be provided in subsequent articles. For DPG methods,
the current theory of a posteriori error estimation is reviewed and the
reliability estimate in [13, Theorem 2.1] is improved on. For DPG* methods,
three different classes of refinement indicators are derived and several
contributions are made towards rigorous a posteriori error estimation. At the
closure of the article, results of numerical experiments with Poisson's
boundary value problem in a three-dimensional domain are provided. These
results clearly demonstrate the utility of the goal-oriented adaptive mesh
refinement strategies for quantities of interest with either interior or
boundary terms.

a problem inherent to their very nature: they are not geometrical object, and
they behave in their own way (synthesized by the Ito formula) under changes of

estimated via the injection and posterior recovery of simulated gravitational
wave signals in the detector data streams. When a search reports no detections,
the estimated sensitivity is then used to place upper limits on the coalescence
rate of the target source. In order to obtain correct sensitivity and rate
estimates, the injected waveforms must be faithful representations of the real
signals. Up to date, however, injected waveforms have neglected radiation modes
of order higher than the quadrupole, potentially biasing sensitivity and
coalescence rate estimates. In particular, higher-order modes are known to have
a large impact in the gravitational waves emitted by intermediate mass black
holes binaries. In this work we evaluate the impact of this approximation in
the context of two search algorithms run by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
in their search for intermediate mass black hole binaries in the O1 LIGO
Science Run data: a matched-filter based pipeline and a coherent un-modeled
one. To this end we estimate the sensitivity of both searches to simulated
signals including and omitting higher-order modes. We find that omission of
higher-order modes leads to biases in the sensitivity estimates which depend on
the masses of the binary, the search algorithm and the required level of
significance for detection. In addition, we compare the sensitivity of the two
search algorithms across the studied parameter space. We conclude that the most
recent LIGO-Virgo upper limits on the rate of coalescence of intermediate mass
black hole binaries are conservative for the case of highly asymmetric
binaries. However, the tightest upper limits, placed for nearly-equal-mass
sources, remain unchanged due to the small contribution of higher modes to the
corresponding sources.

leading to new arithmetic and geometric results concerning K-equivalent

K-equivalent smooth projective complex varieties, we show that K-equivalent
smooth projective $\mathbb{F}_q$-varieties have isomorphic rational $\ell$-adic
Galois representations (up to semisimplification), and so also the same zeta
functions (the equality of zeta functions is true even without projectivity).
This is an arithmetic result inaccessible to classical motivic integration.
This paper also gives more evidence for a conjecture of Chin-Lung Wang
suggesting the equivalence of integral motives of K-equivalent smooth
projective varieties. Furthermore, we connect our theory of integration of
rational Voevodsky motives to the existence of motivic $t$-structures for
geometric Voevodsky motives; we show that the existence of a motivic
t-structure implies that K-equivalent smooth projective varieties have
equivalent rational (Chow) motives. We also connect this to a conjecture of
Orlov concerning bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. This makes
progress on showing that all cohomology theories should agree for K-equivalent

To address these problems, we introduce a network growth algorithm that

methods to automate the generation of compact and accurate DNNs. NeST starts
with a randomly initialized sparse network called the seed architecture. It
iteratively tunes the architecture with gradient-based growth and
magnitude-based pruning of neurons and connections. Our experimental results
show that NeST yields accurate, yet very compact DNNs, with a wide range of
seed architecture selection. For the LeNet-300-100 (LeNet-5) architecture, we
reduce network parameters by 70.2x (74.3x) and floating-point operations

substantial advances in parameterized complexity. However, our perception is
that, except for Lenstra's algorithm for solving integer linear programming in
fixed dimension, there is still little understanding in the parameterized
complexity community of the strengths and limitations of the available tools.
This is understandable: it is often difficult to infer exact runtimes or even
the distinction between FPT and XP algorithms, and some knowledge is simply
unwritten folklore in a different community. We wish to make a step in
remedying this situation.
  To that end, we first provide an easy to navigate quick reference guide of
integer programming algorithms from the perspective of parameterized
complexity. Then, we show their applications in three case studies, obtaining
FPT algorithms with runtime $f(k)poly(n)$. We focus on:
  * Modeling: since the algorithmic results follow by applying existing
algorithms to new models, we shift the focus from the complexity result to the
modeling result, highlighting common patterns and tricks which are used.
  * Optimality program: after giving an FPT algorithm, we are interested in
reducing the dependence on the parameter; we show which algorithms and tricks
are often useful for speed-ups.
  * Minding the poly(n): reducing $f(k)$ often has the unintended consequence
of increasing poly(n); so we highlight the common trade-offs and show how to
get the best of both worlds.
  Specifically, we consider graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity which are
in a sense the simplest of dense graphs, and we show several FPT algorithms for
Capacitated Dominating Set, Sum Coloring, and Max-q-Cut by modeling them as
convex programs in fixed dimension, n-fold integer programs, bounded dual
treewidth programs, and indefinite quadratic programs in fixed dimension.

researched. Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard
allowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in
both directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern
and searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can
yield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a
difficult combinatorial optimization problem.
  Here for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to
solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of
pieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP
significantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon
previous ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina
reads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking.
Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of
search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the
best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index
with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate
a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the
bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text
verification using dynamic programming outperforms today's best aligners. The
development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching

max-entropy distributions over a large support (e.g., $2^m$) with a specified
marginal vector have succinct descriptions (polynomial-size in the input
description)? and: Are entropy maximizing distributions ""stable"" under the
perturbation of the marginal vector? have resisted a rigorous resolution.
  Here we show that these questions are related and resolve both of them. Our
main result shows a ${\rm poly}(m, \log 1/\varepsilon)$ bound on the bit
complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal dual solutions to the maximum entropy
convex program -- for very general support sets and with no restriction on the
marginal vector. Applications of this result include polynomial time algorithms
to compute max-entropy distributions over several new and old polytopes for any
marginal vector in a unified manner, a polynomial time algorithm to compute the
Brascamp-Lieb constant in the rank-1 case. The proof of this result allows us
to show that changing the marginal vector by $\delta$ changes the max-entropy
distribution in the total variation distance roughly by a factor of ${\rm

is exponential. Together, our results put max-entropy distributions on a

11792 (2003){]} provides a promising paradigm to efficiently determine the
ionic entropies of liquids from molecular dynamics (MD). In this model, the
vibrational density of states (VDoS) of a liquid is decomposed into a diffusive
gas-like component and a vibrational solid-like component. By treating the
diffusive component as hard sphere (HS) gas and the vibrational component as
harmonic oscillators, the ionic entropy of the liquid is determined. Here we
examine three issues crucial for practical implementations of the 2PT model:
(i) the mismatch between the VDoS of the liquid system and that of the HS gas;
(ii) the excess entropy of the HS gas; (iii) the partition of the gas-like and
solid-like components. Some of these issues have not been addressed before, yet
they profoundly change the entropy predicted from the model. Based on these
findings, a revised 2PT formalism is proposed and successfully tested in
systems with Lennard-Jones potentials as well as many-atom potentials of liquid
metals. Aside from being capable of performing quick entropy estimations for a
wide range of systems, the formalism also supports fine-tuning to accurately
determine entropies at specific thermal states.

strongly shaping both sectors of the model and leading to a very characteristic
phenomenology. The scalar sector is analyzed in detail, and in the Yukawa
sector we list all possible CP4-symmetric structures which do not run into
immediate conflict with experiment, namely, do not lead to massless or
mass-degenerate quarks nor to insufficient mixing or CP-violation in the CKM

constrained by CP4, is large enough to comply with the electroweak precision
data and the LHC results for the 125 GeV Higgs boson phenomenology, as well as
to perfectly reproduce all fermion masses, mixing, and CP violation. Despite
the presence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy Higgs
scalars, we find through a parameter space scan many points which accurately
reproduce the kaon CP-violating parameter $\epsilon_K$ as well as oscillation
parameters in K and $B_{(s)}$ mesons. Thus, CP4 offers a novel minimalistic
framework for building models with very few assumptions, sufficient predictive

empowering us to identify groups of actors with similar interests. There have
been extensive works focusing on finding communities in static networks,
however, in reality, due to dynamic nature of social networks, they are
evolving continuously. Ignoring the dynamic aspect of social networks, neither
allows us to capture evolutionary behavior of the network nor to predict the
future status of individuals. Aside from being dynamic, another significant
characteristic of real-world social networks is the presence of leaders, i.e.
nodes with high degree centrality having a high attraction to absorb other
members and hence to form a local community. In this paper, we devised an
efficient method to incrementally detect communities in highly dynamic social
networks using the intuitive idea of importance and persistence of community
leaders over time. Our proposed method is able to find new communities based on
the previous structure of the network without recomputing them from scratch.
This unique feature, enables us to efficiently detect and track communities
over time rapidly. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world social
networks demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient in
discovering communities in dynamic social networks.

solutions of the reaction-diffusion equations, modeled by the equation $-\Delta
u+\sigma u= f$ in $\Omega$ with any $\sigma={\mathrm{const}}\ge 0$. We also
term our bounds consistent due to one specific property. It assumes that their
orders of accuracy in respect to mesh size $h$ are the same with the respective
not improvable in the order a priori bounds. Additionally, it assumes that the
pointed out equality of the orders is provided by the testing flaxes not
subjected to equilibration. For any $\sigma\in [0,\sigma_*]$, the rirght part
of the new general bound of the paper contains, besides the usual diffusion
term, the $L_2$ norm of the residual with the factor $1/\sqrt{\sigma_*}$, where
$\sigma_*$ is some critical value. For solutions by the finite element method,
it is estimated as $\sigma_*\ge ch^{-2},\,\,c={\mathrm{const}}$, if $\partial
\Omega$ is sufficiently smooth and the finite element space is of the
1$^{\mathrm{st}}$ order of accuracy at least. In general, at the derivation of
a posteriori bounds, consistency is achieved by taking adequately into account
the difference of the orders of the $L_2$ and $H^1$ error norms, that can be
done in various ways with accordingly introduced $\sigma_*$. Two advantages of
the obtained consistent a posteriori error bounds deserve attention. They are
better accuracy and the possibility to avoid the use of the equilibration in
the flax recovery procedures, that may greatly simplify these procedures and
make them much more universal. The technique of obtaining the consistent a
posteriori bounds was briefly exposed by the author in [arXiv:1702.00433v1

been the basis of modern theory for probability and statistics. In certain
applications it is, however, necessary or convenient to allow improper
(unbounded) distributions, which is often done without a theoretical
foundation. The paper reviews a recent theory which includes improper
distributions, and which is related to Renyi's theory of conditional
probability spaces. It is in particular demonstrated how the theory leads to
simple explanations of apparent paradoxes known from the Bayesian literature.
Several examples from statistical practice with improper distributions are
discussed in light of the given theoretical results, which also include a
recent theory of convergence of proper distributions to improper ones.

detection by changing their mass with the local density. These models are an
archetypal example of a screening mechanism, and have become an important
target for both cosmological surveys and terrestrial experiments. In particular
there has been much recent interest in searching for chameleon fifth forces in
the laboratory. It is known that the chameleon force is less screened around
non-spherical sources, but only the field profiles around a few simple shapes
are known analytically. In this work we introduce a numerical code that solves
for the chameleon field around arbitrary shapes with azimuthal symmetry placed
in a spherical vacuum chamber. We find that deviations from spherical symmetry
can increase the chameleon acceleration experienced by a test particle by up to
a factor of $\sim 3$, and that the least screened objects are those which
minimize some internal dimension.

opportunistic human mobility, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm, where prolonging battery life of constrained devices and
motivating human involvement are two key design challenges. To address these,
we envision a novel framework, named wirelessly powered crowd sensing (WPCS),
which integrates MCS with wireless power transfer (WPT) for supplying the
involved devices with extra energy and thus facilitating user incentivization.
This paper considers a multiuser WPCS system where an access point (AP)
transfers energy to multiple mobile sensors (MSs), each of which performs data
sensing, compression, and transmission. Assuming lossless (data) compression,
an optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously maximize data utility
and minimize energy consumption at the operator side, by jointly controlling
wireless-power allocation at the AP as well as sensing-data sizes, compression
ratios, and sensor-transmission durations at the MSs. Given fixed compression
ratios, the proposed optimal power allocation policy has the threshold-based
structure with respect to a defined crowd-sensing priority function for each MS
depending on both the operator configuration and the MS information. Further,
for fixed sensing-data sizes, the optimal compression policy suggests that
compression can reduce the total energy consumption at each MS only if the
sensing-data size is sufficiently large. Our solution is also extended to the
case of lossy compression, while extensive simulations are offered to confirm
the efficiency of the contributed mechanisms.

metasurfaces were made of a hexagonally close packed (hcp) monolayer of gold
nanospheres coated with tunable alkanethiol ligand shells, controlling the
interparticle gap from 2.8 to 0.45 nm. In contrast to isolated dimer studies,
the macro-scale areas allow for billions of gaps to be simultaneously probed

enabling subnanometer length scale mechanisms to be reproducibly measured in
the far-field. We demonstrate for subnanometer gaps, that the optical response
of the metasurfaces agrees well with a classical (local) model, with minor
nonlocal effects and no clear evidence of ligand-mediated charge transfer at

whether G contains a set of pairwise edge-disjoint paths connecting every

problem that allow for efficient (polynomial-time or fpt) algorithms. As our
first result, we answer an open question stated in Fleszar, Mnich, and
Spoerhase (2016), by showing that the problem can be solved in polynomial time
if the input graph has a feedback vertex set of size one. We also show that EDP
parameterized by the treewidth and the maximum degree of the input graph is
fixed-parameter tractable.
  Having developed two novel algorithms for EDP using structural restrictions
on the input graph, we then turn our attention towards the augmented graph,
i.e., the graph obtained from the input graph after adding one edge between
every terminal pair. In constrast to the input graph, where EDP is known to
remain NP-hard even for treewidth two, a result by Zhou et al. (2000) shows
that EDP can be solved in non-uniform polynomial time if the augmented graph
has constant treewidth; we note that the possible improvement of this result to
an fpt-algorithm has remained open since then. We show that this is highly
unlikely by establishing the W[1]-hardness of the problem parameterized by the
treewidth (and even feedback vertex set) of the augmented graph. Finally, we
develop an fpt-algorithm for EDP by exploiting a novel structural parameter of

the medium gets more strongly coupled. The radial propagation speed of the
spiral wave is observed to remain unaltered with the coupling parameter.
However, it is found to depend on the screening parameter of the dust medium

$\operatorname{ex}(G, \mathcal{H})$ where $\mathcal{H}$ is a fixed family of
graphs and $G=G_n$ is taken from a `standard' increasing sequence of host
graphs $(G_1, G_2, \dots)$, most often $K_n$ or $K_{n,n}$. Inverting the
question, we can instead ask how large $e(G)$ can be with respect to
$\operatorname{ex}(G,\mathcal{H})$. We show that the standard sequences indeed
maximize $e(G)$ for some choices of $\mathcal{H}$, but not for others. Many
interesting questions and previous results arise very naturally in this
context, which also, unusually, gives rise to sensible extremal questions
concerning multigraphs and non-uniform hypergraphs.

cross-section and parton-level event generator whose main purpose is to add
transverse momentum resummation to a general class of inclusive processes at
hadron colliders, namely all those which do not involve hadrons or jets in the
measured final state. This documentation refers to the first main version
release, which will form the basis for continued developments, consequently it
only implements the key features of those we plan to ultimately include. This
article acts as a manual for the program; describing in detail its use,
structure, validation and results; whilst also highlighting key aspects of the
resummation formalism applied. It details the two classes of processes so far
included; these are diphoton production and Drell-Yan production.
  A main concept behind the development of the tool is that it is a hands-on
white box for the user: significant effort has been made to give the program a
modular structure, making the various parts which comprise it independent of
each other as much as possible and ensuring they are transparently documented,
customizable and, in principle, replaceable with something that may better
serve the users needs.
  reSolve is a new C++ program, based on an evolution of the private Fortran
code 2gres, previously used for the calculations in refs. [1] and [2]; it is
also influenced by the DYRes Fortran code of refs. [3] and [4]. This initial
version calculates the low transverse momentum contribution to the fully
differential cross-section for two main categories of processes; the inclusive
production of two photons, and inclusive Drell-Yan production. In all cases
resummation up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithm (NNLL) is included. We aim
to extend the program to several more processes in the near future. The program
is publicly available on Github.

as small as 10-30 pc (the smallest is 11(-6)(+28) pc). The uncertainty in these

suggesting a likely break in the size-luminosity relation at ~-17 mag with size

neutrinos from blazars. We compute the nuclear cascade in the jet for both BL
Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), and in the ambient
radiation zones for FSRQs as well. By modeling representative spectral energy
distributions along the blazar sequence, two distinct regimes are identified,
which we call ""nuclear survival"" -- typically found in low-luminosity BL Lacs,
and ""nuclear cascade"" -- typically found in high-luminosity FSRQs. We quantify
how the neutrino and cosmic-ray (CR) emission efficiencies evolve over the
blazar sequence, and demonstrate that neutrinos and CRs come from very
different object classes. For example, high-frequency peaked BL Lacs (HBLs)
tend to produce CRs, and HL-FSRQs are the more efficient neutrino emitters.
This conclusion does not depend on the CR escape mechanism, for which we
discuss two alternatives (diffusive and advective escape). Finally, the
neutrino spectrum from blazars is shown to significantly depend on the
injection composition into the jet, especially in the nuclear cascade case:
Injection compositions heavier than protons lead to reduced neutrino production
at the peak, which moves at the same time to lower energies. Thus, these
sources will exhibit better compatibility with the observed IceCube and UHECR
data.

simulations (in axisymmetry) for a massive neutron star (MNS) surrounded by a
torus, which is a canonical remnant formed after the binary neutron star
merger. We take into account the effects of viscosity, which is likely to arise
in the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. As the initial
condition, we employ the azimuthally averaged data of the MNS-torus system
derived in a three-dimensional, numerical-relativity simulation for the binary
neutron star merger. The viscous effect plays key roles for the remnant
evolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the
first $t\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to
a rigidly rotating state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently
becomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity of the MNS due to the variation
of the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS. The shock wave induces significant
mass ejection of mass $\sim(0.5-2.0)\times 10^{-2}M_\odot$ for the alpha
viscosity parameter of $0.01-0.04$. For the longer-term evolution with $\sim
0.1-10$ s, a significant fraction of the torus material is ejected. The ejecta
mass is likely to be of order $10^{-2}M_\odot$, so that the total mass of the
viscosity-driven ejecta could dominate that of the dynamical ejecta of mass
$\lesssim 10^{-2}M_\odot$. The electron fraction, $Y_e$, of the ejecta is
always high enough ($Y_e\gtrsim0.25$) that this post-merger ejecta is
lanthanide-poor; hence, the opacity of the ejecta is likely to be $\sim 10-100$
times lower than that of the dynamical ejecta. This indicates that the
electromagnetic signal from the ejecta would be rapidly evolving, bright, and
blue if it is observed from a small viewing angle ($\lesssim 45^\circ$) for
which the effect of the dynamical ejecta is minor.

debated, owing partly to selection effects inherent to studies of the
merger/AGN connection. In particular, luminous AGN are often heavily obscured
in late-stage mergers. Mid-infrared (IR) color selection of dust-enshrouded AGN
with, e.g., the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has uncovered large
new populations of obscured AGN. However, this method is sensitive mainly to
AGN that dominate emission from the host. To understand how these selection
biases affect mid-IR studies of the merger/AGN connection, we simulate the
evolution of obscured AGN throughout galaxy mergers. Although mid-IR colors
closely trace luminous, obscured AGN, we show that nearly half of
merger-triggered AGN are missed with common mid-IR selection criteria, even in
late-stage, gas-rich major mergers. At z < 0.5, where merger signatures and
dual nuclei can most easily be detected, we find that a more lenient W1-W2 >
0.5 cut greatly improves completeness without significantly decreasing
reliability. Extreme nuclear starbursts are briefly able to mimic this AGN
signature, but this is largely irrelevant in mergers, where such starbursts are
accompanied by AGN. We propose a two-color cut that yields high completeness
and reliability even in starbursting systems. Further, we show that mid-IR
color selection very effectively identifies dual AGN hosts, with the highest
fraction at the smallest separations (< 3 kpc). Thus, many merger hosts of
mid-IR AGN should contain unresolved dual AGN; these are ideal targets for
high-resolution follow-up, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope.

understand the suitability of anticipated TESS planet discoveries for
atmospheric characterization by JWST's Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless
Spectrograph (NIRISS) by employing a simulation tool to estimate the
signal-to-noise (S/N) achievable in transmission spectroscopy. We applied this
tool to Monte Carlo predictions of the TESS expected planet yield and then
compared the S/N for anticipated TESS discoveries to our estimates of S/N for
18 known exoplanets. We analyzed the sensitivity of our results to planetary
composition, cloud cover, and presence of an observational noise floor. We
found that several hundred anticipated TESS discoveries with radii from 1.5 to
2.5 times the Earth's radius will produce S/N higher than currently known
exoplanets in this radius regime, such as K2-3b or K2-3c. In the terrestrial
planet regime, we found that only a few anticipated TESS discoveries will
result in higher S/N than currently known exoplanets, such as the TRAPPIST-1
planets, GJ1132b, and LHS1140b. However, we emphasize that this outcome is
based upon Kepler-derived occurrence rates, and that co-planar compact
multi-planet systems (e.g., TRAPPIST-1) may be under-represented in the
predicted TESS planet yield. Finally, we apply our calculations to estimate the
required magnitude of a JWST follow-up program devoted to mapping the
transition region between hydrogen-dominated and high molecular weight
atmospheres. We find that a modest observing program of between 60 to 100 hours
of charged JWST time can define the nature of that transition (e.g., step

a top-light initial mass function (IMF). Here we present the first
high-resolution, very metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-1 to -3) sample of 13 giant stars in
the main body of Sgr. We derive abundances of 13 elements namely C, Ca, Co, Fe,
Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Eu, Dy, Pb, and Th which challenge the interpretation based
on previous studies. Our abundances from Sgr mimic those of the metal-poor halo

Abundances of Sr, Pb, and Th are presented for the first time in Sgr, allowing
for age determination using nuclear cosmochronology. We calculate ages of
9$\pm$2.5 Gyr. Most of the sample stars have been enriched by a range of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses between 1.3 and 5 M$_{\odot}$.
Sgr J190651.47-320147.23 shows a large overabundance of Pb (2.05dex) and a
peculiar abundance pattern best fit by a 3 M$_{\odot}$ AGB star. Based on
star-to-star scatter and observed abundance patterns a mixture of low- and
high-mass AGB stars and supernovae (15-25 M$_{\odot}$) are necessary to explain
these patterns. The high level (0.29$\pm$0.05 dex) of Ca indicates that massive
supernovae must have existed and polluted the early ISM of Sgr before it lost
its gas. This result is in contrast with a top-light IMF with no massive stars
polluting Sgr.

enhanced mass loss rate from the modeled star during the $^{16}$O and $^{28}$Si
burning stages and construct the CSM from the resulting mass-loss history in a
self-consistent way. Once such evolved pre-SN stars are exploded, we find that
the models with early interaction between the shock and the dense CSM reproduce
the light curves far better than those without that mass loss and hence having
no dense, nearby CSM. The required explosion energy for the progenitors with a
dense CSM is reduced by almost a factor of two compared to those without the
CSM. Our model, with a more realistic CSM profile and presupernova and
explosion parameters, fits observed data much better throughout the rise,
plateau and radioactive tail phases compared to previous studies. This points
to an intermediate class of supernovae between type II-P/II-L and type II-n SNe

meteorites and originate from highly energetic, local processes during the
first million years after the birth of the Sun. So far, an astrophysically
consistent chondrule formation scenario, explaining major chemical, isotopic
and textural features, remains elusive. Here, we examine the prospect of
forming chondrules from planetesimal collisions. We show that intensely melted
bodies with interior magma oceans became rapidly chemically equilibrated and
physically differentiated. Therefore, collisional interactions among such
bodies would have resulted in chondrule-like but basaltic spherules, which are
not observed in the meteoritic record. This inconsistency with the expected
dynamical interactions hints at an incomplete understanding of the planetary
growth regime during the protoplanetary disk phase. To resolve this conundrum,
we examine how the observed chemical and isotopic features of chondrules
constrain the dynamical environment of accreting chondrite parent bodies by
interpreting the meteoritic record as an impact-generated proxy of
planetesimals that underwent repeated collision and reaccretion cycles. Using a
coupled evolution-collision model we demonstrate that the vast majority of
collisional debris feeding the asteroid main belt must be derived from
planetesimals which were partially molten at maximum. Therefore, the precursors
of chondrite parent bodies either formed primarily small, from sub-canonical
aluminum-26 reservoirs, or collisional destruction mechanisms were efficient
enough to shatter planetesimals before they reached the magma ocean phase.
Finally, we outline the window in parameter space for which chondrule formation
from planetesimal collisions can be reconciled with the meteoritic record and
how our results can be used to further constrain early solar system dynamics.

brightness and stellar mass distributions of 193 cluster members, of which 144

and the hot gas to total mass fraction increases from 3% to 9%, resulting in a
baryon fraction of approximately 10% at the outermost radius. We measure that
the stellar component represents ~ 30%, near the cluster center, and 15%, at
larger clustercentric distances, of the total mass in the cluster

of the diffuse (cluster) dark-matter is shallower than a NFW profile. Our

$2.5\pm0.2$ kpc, $1-2\times$ the continuum sizes, in agreement with previous

$t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production in proton--proton collisions at 13 and 100 TeV.
All the non-vanishing contributions of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^i \alpha^j)$ with
$i+j=3,4$ for $t\bar{t}W^{\pm}$ and $i+j=4,5$ for $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ are
evaluated without any approximation. For $t\bar{t}W^{\pm}$ we find that, due to
the presence of $tW \to tW$ scattering, at 13(100) TeV the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s \alpha^3)$ contribution is about 12(70)\% of the LO,
i.e., it is larger than the so-called NLO EW corrections (the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2 \alpha^2)$ terms) and has opposite sign. In the case of
$t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production, large contributions from electroweak $tt \to tt$
scattering are already present at LO in the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3 \alpha)$
and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2 \alpha^2)$ terms. For the same reason we find that
both NLO terms of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4 \alpha)$, i.e., the NLO EW
corrections, and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3 \alpha^2)$ are large ($\pm 15 \%$ of
the LO) and their relative contributions strongly depend on the values of the
renormalisation and factorisation scales. However, large accidental
cancellations are present (away from the threshold region) between these two
contributions. Moreover, the NLO corrections strongly depend on the kinematics
and are particularly large at the threshold, where even the relative
contribution from $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2 \alpha^3)$ terms amounts to tens of
percents.

be performed in near real-time, providing a continuous monitor at the condition
of the detector. The intrinsic $^{39}$Ar beta emitter provides another way to
calibrate the detector thanks to well defined properties and uniformly

fitting the energy spectrum of experimental $^{39}$Ar data. Moreover, the
preliminary results from cold gas run shows the best measurement on triplet

attained by MiniCLEAN's purification system. The long triplet lifetime in
gaseous argon can be exploit to obtain better performance of pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) for future dark matter detector, also the low density of
gaseous argon reduced the multi-scattering neutron backgrounds. On the other
hand, by injecting $^{39}$Ar spike, the electronic recoil events due to
$^{39}$Ar beta decay can be used to test the limit of PSD in liquid argon. The
results will be informative for future multi-tonne LAr detector.

Nonetheless, the basic understanding of this `observable' still seems to be

a view that we scrutinize here. In order to extrapolate the available
perturbative approach to phenomenologically relevant temperatures, we consider
carefully controllable higher-order corrections: We adapt the leading-order
effective kinetic scheme (instead of the catchy next-to-leading log formula
$\eta_{_{{\rm NLL}}} \propto [\alpha^2 \log(c/\alpha)]^{-1}$), by using cross
sections with a running coupling. This effect should be pertinent (for a QGP)
and we argue for a choice of scale-dependence that makes it consistent with
thermal screening. We conclude that $\eta/s \approx 0.2$ does not indicate
genuine non-perturbative effects, it may rather be understood within
resummation-improved perturbative QCD, with some uncertainties from deploying
kinetic theory near to its limit.

difference in the abundances of r-process elements, as found in the ultra-faint

prevents us from collecting information from a sufficient number of stars in

r-process abundances or is an exception. We perform high-resolution
spectroscopic measurements of r-process abundances for twelve metal-poor stars
in the Draco dwarf galaxy in the metallicity range of -2.5<[Fe/H]<-2. We found
that these stars are separated into two groups with r-process abundances
differing by one order of magnitude. A group of stars with high abundances of
r-process elements was formed by a single r-process event that corresponds to
the event evidenced in Ret II. On the other hand, the low r-process abundance
group was formed by another sporadic enrichment channel producing a far fewer
r-process elements, which is clearly identified for the first time.
Accordingly, we identified two populations of stars with different r-process

Moreover, for a Weyl loop system (two-fold degenerate at the nodal loop), the

hinge modes in a cubic sample when mirror symmetry is broken. For a Dirac loop

Magellanic Clouds and spanning 1 dex in metallicity. We double the number of
dusty AGB stars known in these galaxies and find that most are carbon rich. We
also find 26 dusty M-type stars, mostly in IC 10. Given the large dust excess
and tight spatial distribution of these M-type stars, they are most likely on
the upper end of the AGB mass range (stars undergoing Hot Bottom Burning).
Theoretical models do not predict significant dust production in metal-poor
M-type stars, but we see evidence for dust excess around M-type stars even in
the most metal-poor galaxies in our sample (12+log(O/H) = 7.26-7.50). The low
metallicities and inferred high stellar masses (up to ~10 $M_\odot$) suggest
that AGB stars can produce dust very early in the evolution of galaxies (~30
Myr after they form), and may contribute significantly to the dust reservoirs

increase to $(n\ln n)^{-s/(s+d)} (\Psi^{-1}(n))^{d(1-d/p(s+d))} + n^{-1/2}$,

3-dimensional (3D) cues such as point clouds obtained from LIDAR, RADAR or
stereo cameras or 2-dimensional (2D) cues such as lane markings, road
boundaries and object detection. Typical 3D point clouds do not have enough
resolution to detect fine differences in heights such as between road and
pavement. Image based 2D cues fail when encountering uneven road textures such
as due to shadows, potholes, lane markings or road restoration. We propose a
novel free road space detection technique combining both 2D and 3D cues. In
particular, we use CNN based road segmentation from 2D images and plane/box
fitting on sparse depth data obtained from SLAM as priors to formulate an
energy minimization using conditional random field (CRF), for road pixels
classification. While the CNN learns the road texture and is unaffected by
depth boundaries, the 3D information helps in overcoming texture based
classification failures. Finally, we use the obtained road segmentation with
the 3D depth data from monocular SLAM to detect the free space for the
navigation purposes. Our experiments on KITTI odometry dataset, Camvid dataset,
as well as videos captured by us, validate the superiority of the proposed
approach over the state of the art.

such as sputter deposition, have on thin film morphology has long been the
subject of interest. One notable effect is that of column development due to
differential chamber pressure in the well-known empirical model called
Thornton's Structure Zone Model. The model is qualitative in nature and
theoretical understanding with quantitative predictions of the morphology is
still lacking due to, in part, the absence of a quantitative description of the
incident flux distribution on the growth front. In this work, we propose an
incident Gaussian flux model developed from a series of binary hard-sphere
collisions and simulate its effects using Monte Carlo methods and a
solid-on-solid growth scheme. We also propose an approximate cosine-power
distribution for faster Monte Carlo sampling. With this model, it is observed
that higher chamber pressures widen the average deposition angle, and similarly
increase the growth of column diameters (or lateral correlation length) and the
column-to-column separation (film surface wavelength). We treat both the column
diameter and the surface wavelength as power laws. It is seen that both the
column diameter exponent and the wavelength exponent are very sensitive to
changes in pressure for low pressures (0.13 Pa to 0.80 Pa); meanwhile both
exponents saturate for higher pressures (0.80 Pa to 6.7 Pa) around a value of
0.6. These predictions will serve as guides to future experiments for
quantitative description of film morphology under a wide range of vapor
pressure.

significant complexities in the energy reformulations and resultant dynamics,
often leading to implicit systems of equations and requiring inversion of
high-dimensional matrices in the leapfrog steps. Our approach provides a
simpler alternative, by using existing dynamics in the sampling step of a Monte
Carlo EM framework, and learning the mass matrices in the M step with a novel
online technique. We also propose a way to adaptively set the number of samples
gathered in the E step, using sampling error estimates from the leapfrog
dynamics. Along with a novel stochastic sampler based on Nos\'{e}-Poincar\'{e}
dynamics, we use this framework with standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as
well as newer stochastic algorithms such as SGHMC and SGNHT, and show strong
performance on synthetic and real high-dimensional sampling scenarios; we
achieve sampling accuracies comparable to Riemannian samplers while being
significantly faster.

characteristics of the polar brightening within coronal holes at 17 GHz. The
simulations were carried out by calculating the radio emission of the small
loops, with several temperature and density profiles, within a 2D coronal hole
atmospheric model. If located at high latitudes, the size of the simulated
bright patches are much smaller than the beam size and they present the
instrument beam size when observed. The larger bright patches can be generated
by a great number of small magnetic loops unresolved by the NoRH beam. Loop
models that reproduce bright patches contain denser and hotter plasma near the
upper chromosphere and lower corona. On the other hand, loops with increased
plasma density and temperature only in the corona do not contribute to the
emission at 17 GHz. This could explain the absence of a one-to-one association
between the 17 GHz bright patches and those observed in extreme ultraviolet.
Moreover, the emission arising from small magnetic loops located close to the

brightness temperature and width.

following when the bidder has $n$ possible deadlines:
  - Exponential menu complexity is necessary to be exactly optimal: There exist
instances where the optimal mechanism has menu complexity is $2^n-1$. This
matches exactly the upper bound provided by Fiat et al.'s algorithm, and
resolves one of their open questions [FGKK16].
  - Fully polynomial menu complexity is necessary and sufficient for

multiplicative (1-\epsilon)-approximation to the optimal revenue with menu
complexity $O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\frac{\min\{n/\epsilon,\ln(v_{\max})\}}{\epsilon}})
= O(n^2/\epsilon)$, where $v_{\max}$ denotes the largest value in the support

corona as the result of an eruption. Since no vector magnetograms were
available for the X6.5 flare, we applied the azimuthal symmetry approach to
line-of-sight magnetograms to reconstruct the pseudo-vector magnetic field and
investigate the changes in average twist and inclination of magnetic field in
the sunspot around the time of the flare. For the X2.2 flare, results from the
full vector magnetograms were compared with the pseudo-vector field data. For
both flares, the data show changes consistent with the twist-removal scenario.
We also evaluate the validity of the azimuthal symmetry approach on simple
isolated round sunspots. In general, the derivations based on the azimuthal
symmetry approach agree with true-vector field data though we find that even
for symmetric sunspots the distribution of the magnetic field may deviate from

under similar sampling conditions (evenly and frequently sampled), the key
factor determining whether the broadband PRM code can yield lags consistent

found a critical line-to-continuum flux ratio, about 6%, above which the mean
of the ratios between the lags from PRM and SRM becomes closer to unity, and
the scatter is pronouncedly reduced. We also tested our code on a subset of

estimations due to the observation gaps when the R-L relation prior in Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is discarded. The performance of the damped random

two ways: first that the curves are modular, so are associated to suitable
Bianchi newforms; and second that a certain level-lowering conjecture holds for
Bianchi newforms. We also classify all elliptic curves of prime power conductor

significantly higher electron densities than seen in the remnant's filaments.
This along with a bow-shaped morphology suggests it is likely red giant
mass-loss material shocked and accelerated by passage of the Cygnus Loop's
blast wave. We also identify a B7 V star located along the remnant's

curvature of the Universe is essentially dynamically negligible - but only if
relatively strong assumptions are made about the equation of state of dark
energy (DE). When these assumptions are relaxed, strong degeneracies arise that
make it hard to disentangle DE and curvature, degrading the constraints. We
show that forthcoming 21cm intensity mapping experiments such as HIRAX are
ideally designed to carry out model-independent curvature measurements, as they
can measure the clustering signal at high redshift with sufficient precision to
break many of the degeneracies. We consider two different model-independent
methods, based on `avoiding' the DE-dominated regime and non-parametric
modelling of the DE equation of state respectively. Our forecasts show that
HIRAX will be able to improve upon current model-independent constraints by
around an order of magnitude, reaching percent-level accuracy even when an
arbitrary DE equation of state is assumed. In the same model-independent

vital to search for such new phenomena and the mass scale associated with
neutrino mass generation at high energy colliders. In this review, we consider
a number of representative Seesaw scenarios as phenomenological benchmarks,

decryption and encryption of all emails using PGP. Users do not need to
understand the internal workings of the encryption process to use the
application. MEG is meant to be email-client-agnostic, enabling users to employ
virtually any email service to send messages. Encryption actions are performed
on the user's mobile device, which means their keys and data remain personal.
MEG can also tackle network effect problems by inviting non-users to join. Most
importantly, MEG uses end-to-end encryption, which ensures that all aspects of
the encrypted information remains private. As a result, we are hopeful that MEG
will finally solve the problem of practical email encryption.

truncation of an infinite number of flow equations to a finite set. Here we
generalize the pf-FRG approach to SU(N)-spin systems with arbitrary N and
demonstrate that the scheme becomes exact in the large-N limit. Numerically
solving the generalized real-space renormalization group equations for
arbitrary N, we can make a stringent connection between the physically most

study of the square-lattice SU(N) Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we explicitly
demonstrate that the generalized pf-FRG approach is capable of identifying the
instability indicating the transition into a staggered flux spin liquid ground
state in these models for large, but finite values of N. In a companion paper

pseudofermion functional renormalization group approach (pf-FRG) which,
building on a fermionic parton construction, enables the numerical detection of
the onset of spin liquid states as temperature is lowered. In this work,
focusing on the SU(N) Heisenberg model at large N, we extend this approach in a
way that allows us to directly enter the low-temperature spin liquid phase, and
to probe its character. Our approach proceeds in momentum space, making it
possible to keep the truncation minimalistic, while also avoiding the bias
introduced by an explicit decoupling of the fermionic parton interactions into
a given channel. We benchmark our findings against exact mean-field results in
the large-N limit, and show that even without prior knowledge the pf-FRG
approach identifies the correct mean-field decoupling channel. On a technical
level, we introduce an alternative finite temperature regularization scheme

provide a theoretically appealing framework for the modelling of complex

to the need for exogenous variables with large support for identification, the
curse of dimensionality in estimation, and the lack of inferential tools. This
paper introduces two classes of semiparametric nonseparable triangular models
that address these limitations. They are based on distribution and quantile
regression modelling of the reduced form conditional distributions of the
endogenous variables. We show that average, distribution and quantile
structural functions are identified in these systems through a control function
approach that does not require a large support condition. We propose a
computationally attractive three-stage procedure to estimate the structural
functions where the first two stages consist of quantile or distribution
regressions. We provide asymptotic theory and uniform inference methods for
each stage. In particular, we derive functional central limit theorems and
bootstrap functional central limit theorems for the distribution regression
estimators of the structural functions. These results establish the validity of
the bootstrap for three-stage estimators of structural functions, and lead to
simple inference algorithms. We illustrate the implementation and applicability

experimental and theoretical studies have been focused on circular tubes. Due
to advances in microfluidics, there is a need to study the transport of
individual deformable particles in rectangular microchannels where corner flows
can be important. In this study, we report measurements of hydrodynamic
mobility of confined polymeric particles, vesicles and cancer cells in a linear
microchannel with square cross-section. Our operating conditions are such that
the mobility is measured as a function of geometric confinement over the range
0.3 < l < 1.5 and at specified particle Reynolds numbers that are within 0.1 <
Rep < 2.5. The experimental mobility data of each of these systems is compared
with the circular-tube theory of Hestroni, Haber and Wacholder (J. of Fluid
Mech., 1970) with modifications made for a square cross-section. For polymeric
particles, we find that the mobility data agrees well over a large confinement
range with the theory but under predicts for vesicles. The mobility of vesicles
is higher in a square channel than in a circular tube, and does not depend
significantly on membrane mechanical properties. The mobility of cancer cells
is in good agreement with the theory up to l approaches 0.8, after which it
deviates. Comparison of the mobility data of the three systems reveals that
cancer cells have higher mobility than rigid particles but lower than vesicles,
suggesting that the cell membrane frictional properties are in between a
solid-like interface and a fluid bilayer. We explain further the differences in
the mobility of the three systems by considering their shape deformation and
surface flow on the interface. The results of this study may find potential
applications in drug delivery and biomedical diagnostics.

concentration modes after the point-source flux is modeled. This suggests that
ETG parameters are intrinsically bimodal. The bimodal signature was weak when
analyzed by GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002, 2010). This led us to create several
ensembles of synthetic images to investigate the bias of inferred structural
parameters and compare with GALFIT. GALPHAT inferences are less biased,
especially for high-concentration profiles: GALPHAT S\'ersic index $n$, $r_{e}$
and MAG deviate from the true values by $6\%$, $7.6\%$ and $-0.03

photometric detection of AGN using Bayes factors. For our SDSS sample with
$r_{e}\ge 7.92\,$arcsec, we correctly identify central point sources with
$\mathrm{Mag_{PS}}-\mathrm{Mag_{Sersic}}\le 5$ for $n\le6$ and
$\mathrm{Mag_{PS}}-\mathrm{Mag_{Sersic}}\le 3$ for $n>6$. The magnitude range
increases and classification error decreases with increasing resolution,
suggesting that this approach will excel for upcoming high-resolution surveys.
Future work will extend this to models that test hypotheses of galaxy evolution

other agents can manipulate objects in the workspace, is a challenging problem.
The tight coupling of actions and motions between agents and complexity of

  This paper presents a reactive integrated mission and motion planning for
mobile-robot manipulator systems operating in a partially known environment. We
introduce a multi-layered synergistic framework that receives high-level
mission specifications expressed in linear temporal logic and generates
dynamically-feasible and collision-free motion trajectories to achieve it. In
the high-level layer, a mission planner constructs a symbolic two-player game
between the robots and their environment to synthesis a strategy that adapts to
changes in the workspace imposed by other robots. A bilateral synergistic layer
is developed to map the designed mission plan to an integrated task and motion
planner, constructing a set of robot tasks to move the objects according to the
mission strategy. In the low-level planning stage, verifiable motion
controllers are designed that can be incrementally composed to guarantee a safe
motion planning for each high-level induced task. The proposed framework is
illustrated with a multi-robot warehouse example with the mission of moving
objects to various locations.

of the nanosheet sizes and density revealed that the nanosheet growth was
dominated by the steric hindrance from the surfactant monolayer at lower

higher surface pressure. The ZnO nanosheets exhibited a decreasing work

a critical hypothesis that the nanosheet growth is self-limited by the
formation of a double layer of ionic precursors. This work will open up a new

Results from initial measurements made with the GBT2 array are also presented.
The PAF was developed for the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as part of the Focal
L-band Array for the GBT (FLAG) project. During the first stage of the
development work (Phase I), a prototype cryogenic 19 element dual-polarized
array with ""Kite"" dipole elements was developed and tested on the GBT. The
measured system temperature over efficiency ($T_{sys}/\eta$) ratio for the bore
sight beam of the Kite array was 45.5 K at 1.55 GHz. The off-boresight
$T_{sys}/\eta$ shows an increase by 13 K at an offset equal to the half power
beam width (7$^{'}$.2 at 1.7 GHz). Our measurements indicate that the
off-boresight degradation and field-of-view (FoV) limitation of the Kite array
is simply due to the fixed array size. To increase the FoV, a new 19-element
GBT2 array with larger array spacing was developed during FLAG Phase II. The
frequency response of the array was optimized from 1.2 to 1.6 GHz. A system
with larger cryostat, new low noise amplifiers (LNAs), down-conversion and
digitization close to the front end, unformatted digital transmission over
fiber, ROACH II based polyphase filter banks (PFBs) with bandwidth 150 MHz and
a data acquisition system that records voltage samples from one of the PFB
channels were all developed. The data presented here is processed off-line. The
receiver temperature measured with the new system is 17 K at 1.4 GHz, an
improvement $>$ 8 K over the previous Kite array. Measurements with the GBT2
array on the telescope are in progress. A real time 150 MHz beamformer is also
being developed as part of an NSF-funded collaboration between NRAO/GBO/BYU \&

optimization problem in prices, we show that (i) it can be reduced to a dual
convex optimization problem in prices, and (ii) the revealed preferences can be
interpreted as supergradients of the concave conjugate of valuation, with which
subgradients of the dual function can be computed. We thereby obtain a simple
subgradient-based algorithm for strongly concave valuations and convex cost,
with query complexity $O(m^2/\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon$ is the additive
difference between the social welfare induced by our algorithm and the optimum
social welfare. We also study social welfare maximization under the online

one-by-one in a random order. For the case where consumer valuations can be
arbitrary continuous functions, we propose a price posting mechanism that
achieves an expected social welfare up to an additive factor of $O(\sqrt{mn})$

non-convex in simple cases), we give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on

high X-ray stopping power, has been widely used as an absorber material for
TESs. However, distinct spectral responses have been observed for Bi absorbers
deposited via evaporation versus electroplating. Evaporated Bi absorbers are
widely observed to have a non-Gaussian tail on the low energy side of measured
spectra. In this study, we fabricated Bi absorbers via these two methods, and
performed microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
X-ray diffraction microscopy. The two types of material showed the same

color from a small training set of template SEDs. We first cover the

method to wavelengths beyond the range of the photometric filters. Finally, we
demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by generating 50 additional SED

an open-loop periodic walking motion of the high-dimensional model and then
adding to this solution, a carefully selected set of additional open-loop
trajectories of the model that steer toward the nominal motion. A drawback of
trajectories is that they provide little information on how to respond to a
disturbance. To address this shortcoming, Supervised Machine Learning is used
to extract a low-dimensional state-variable realization of the open-loop
trajectories. The periodic orbit is now an attractor of the low-dimensional
state-variable model but is not attractive in the full-order system. We then
use the special structure of mechanical models associated with bipedal robots

the desired walking motions are locally exponentially stable. The design
procedure is first developed for ordinary differential equations and
illustrated on a simple model. The methods are subsequently extended to a class

its autocorrelation demerit factor, $\text{ADF}(f)$, is the sum of the squared
magnitudes of the aperiodic autocorrelation values over all nonzero shifts for
the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to have unit Euclidean norm. If
$(f,g)$ is a pair of nonzero sequences, then their crosscorrelation demerit
factor, $\text{CDF}(f,g)$, is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the
aperiodic crosscorrelation values over all shifts for the sequences obtained by

a stable de Sitter attractor fixed point but also to an unstable de Sitter

Each family of Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences is obtained from a starting

length of the sequence at each step, and many sequences produced in this manner
have exceptionally low aperiodic autocorrelation. Borwein and Mossinghoff
showed that the asymptotic autocorrelation merit factor for any such family is
at most $3$, and found the seeds of length $40$ or less that produce the
maximum asymptotic merit factor of $3$. The definition of Rudin-Shapiro-like
sequences was generalized by Katz, Lee, and Trunov to include sequences with
arbitrary complex coefficients, among which are families of low autocorrelation
polyphase sequences. Katz, Lee, and Trunov proved that the maximum asymptotic
merit factor is also $3$ for this larger class. Here we show that a family of
such Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences achieves asymptotic merit factor $3$ if and
only if the seed is either of length $1$ or is the interleaving of a pair of
Golay complementary sequences. For small seed lengths where this is not
possible, the optimal seeds are interleavings of pairs that are as close as
possible to being complementary pairs, and the idea of an almost-complementary
pair makes sense of remarkable patterns in previously unexplained data on
optimal seeds for binary Rudin-Shapiro-like sequences.

relaxation, most of the excitation energy is transferred from the electrons to
phonons through the e-ph scattering. This creates hot high-frequency phonons
due to the ph-e scatterings, followed by an energy redistribution between
phonon subsystems through the ph-ph scatterings. This yields an overshoot of
the total longitudinal-acoustic phonon energy at a time, across which a
crossover occurs from a nonequilibrium state, where the e-ph and ph-e
scatterings frequently occur, to a state, where the ph-ph scattering occurs to
reach a thermal equilibrium. This picture is quite different from the scenario
of the well-known two-temperature model (2TM). The behavior of the relaxation

cooling is not important, the accretion flow is hot accretion flow. For the hot
accretion flow, wind is very strong. The mass flux of wind can be $\sim 50\%$
of the mass inflow rate. When the accretion rate increases to a value at which
radiative cooling rate is roughly equal to or slightly larger than viscous

the gas pressure gradient force is small and wind is very weak. Our results may

important processes in metals plasticity. In body-centered cubic (bcc) metals

glide, which is known to take place by the nucleation and sideward relaxation
of kink pairs across two consecutive \emph{Peierls} valleys. In alloys,
dislocations and solutes affect each other's kinetics via long-range stress
field coupling and short-range inelastic interactions. It is known that in
certain substitutional bcc alloys a transition from solute softening to solute
hardening is observed at a critical concentration. In this paper, we develop a
kinetic Monte Carlo model of screw dislocation glide and solute diffusion in
substitutional W-Re alloys. We find that dislocation kinetics is governed by
two competing mechanisms. At low solute concentrations, nucleation is enhanced
by the softening of the Peierls stress, which overcomes the elastic repulsion
of Re atoms on kinks. This trend is reversed at higher concentrations,
resulting in a minimum in the flow stress that is concentration and temperature
dependent. This minimum marks the transition from solute softening to
hardening, which is found to be in reasonable agreement with experiments.

  We show that such a representation allows direct adaptation of standard

slicing from its implementation: first we develop syntactic conditions that a

slices, we may in addition take advantage of knowledge that certain loops will
terminate (almost) always.
  A key feature of our syntactic conditions is that they involve two disjoint
slices such that the variables of one slice are probabilistically independent

probabilistic slicing. In a companion article we show adequacy of the semantics

from recent quantum machine learning techniques, we propose an alternative
approach to quantum error correction aimed at reducing this overhead, which can
be implemented in existing quantum hardware and on a myriad of quantum
computing architectures. This method aims to optimize the average fidelity of
encoding and recovery circuits with respect to the actual noise in the device,
as opposed to that of an artificial or approximate noise model. The quantum
variational error corrector (QVECTOR) algorithm employs a quantum circuit with
parameters that are variationally-optimized according to processed data
originating from quantum sampling of the device, so as to learn encoding and
error-recovery gate sequences. We develop this approach for the task of
preserving quantum memory and analyze its performance with simulations. We find
that, subject to phase damping noise, the simulated QVECTOR algorithm learns a
three-qubit encoding and recovery which extend the effective T2 of a quantum
memory six-fold. Subject to a continuous-time amplitude- plus phase-damping
noise model on five qubits, the simulated QVECTOR algorithm learns encoding and
decoding circuits which exploit the coherence among Pauli errors in the noise
model to outperform the five-qubit stabilizer code and any other scheme that
does not leverage such coherence. Both of these schemes can be implemented with
existing hardware.

sinuous-antenna phased array coupled to transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers
for measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To efficiently cover
a broader range of frequencies, many CMB experiments have begun to deploy
multichroic pixels. For a given cryogenic and optical design, the pixel size
that optimizes the mapping speed is frequency-dependent and increases with
wavelength. If a multichroic pixel is the same size at all frequencies, then
the mapping speed will be optimal in at most one frequency band. To achieve
optimal mapping speed at all frequencies, a pixel size that varies with
frequency is needed. This can be accomplished by creating phased arrays from
neighboring pixels, where the size of each phased array is chosen independently
for each frequency band. As the array unit, we choose a lenslet-coupled sinuous
antenna on account of its wide bandwidth, dual polarization and constant beam
waist. We find that the array factor tends to compensate for beam
non-idealities, so that the sinuous antenna can be substantially undersized
relative to the single-element case; this frees up valuable focal-plane area
for bolometers, bandpass filters, summing networks, readout circuitry, etc. An
additional benefit of a hierarchical phased array is the reduced readout
requirement: since the low frequencies are arrayed to increase their mapping
speeds, the detector count scales approximately logarithmically with the number
of frequency bands. Here we present measurements from a prototype device, in
which hierarchical triangular arrays are used at 90, 150 and 220 GHz to keep
the effective pixel size and, therefore, the beam width roughly constant across
the entire frequency range.

this decline is weakened if spot-induced radial-velocity jitter is strong in

ejection stages. The first stage started from the emergence of a small positive
magnetic polarity, which cancelled with the nearby negative magnetic field and
caused the rising of a mini-filament and its confining loops. This further
resulted in a small jet due to the magnetic reconnection between the rising
confining loops and the overlying open field. The second ejection stage was
mainly due to the successive removal of the confining field by the
reconnection. Thus that the filament erupted and the erupting cool filament
material directly combined with the hot jet originated form the reconnection
region and therefore formed the cool and hot components of the blowout jet.
During the two ejection stages, cool H{\alpha} jets are also observed cospatial
with their coronal counterparts, but their appearance times are earlier than
the hot coronal jets a few minutes. Therefore, the hot coronal jets are
possibly caused by the heating of the cool H{\alpha} jets, or the rising of the
reconnection height from chromosphere to the corona. The scenario that magnetic
reconnection occurred between the confining loops and the overlying open loops
are supported by many observational facts, including the bright patches on the
both sides of the mini-filament, hot plasma blobs along the jet body, and
periodic metric radio type III bursts at the very beginnings of the two stages.
The evolution and characteristics of these features manifest the detailed
non-linear process in the magnetic reconnection.

forces are demonstrated to be rich enough to change single-particle energies
for each eigenstate, so as to enhance the relevant collective mode. When the
quantum self-organization occurs, single-particle energies can be
self-organized (or self-optimized), being enhanced by (i) two quantum liquids,
e.g., protons and neutrons, (ii) two major force components, e.g., quadrupole
interaction (to drive collective mode) and monopole interaction (to control
resistance). Type II shell evolution is considered to be a simple visible case
involving excitations across a (sub)magic gap. Actual cases such as shape
coexistence, quantum phase transition, octupole vibration/deformation, super
deformation, etc. can be studied with this scope. The quantum self-organization
becomes more important in heavier nuclei where the number of active orbits and
the number of active nucleons are larger. With larger numbers of them, the
effects of the organization can be more significant. The quantum

limitations of the specific devices used.
  In this work we build StealthDB - an encrypted database system from Intel

small trusted computing base, scales to large transactional workloads, requires
minor DBMS changes, and provides a relatively strong security guarantees at

whose repeated application provides generated samples. Traditional undirected
graphical models approach this problem indirectly by learning a Markov chain
model whose stationary distribution obeys detailed balance with respect to a
parameterized energy function. The energy function is then modified so the
model and data distributions match, with no guarantee on the number of steps
required for the Markov chain to converge. Moreover, the detailed balance
condition is highly restrictive: energy based models corresponding to neural
networks must have symmetric weights, unlike biological neural circuits. In
contrast, we develop a method for directly learning arbitrarily parameterized
transition operators capable of expressing non-equilibrium stationary
distributions that violate detailed balance, thereby enabling us to learn more
biologically plausible asymmetric neural networks and more general non-energy
based dynamical systems. The proposed training objective, which we derive via
principled variational methods, encourages the transition operator to ""walk
back"" in multi-step trajectories that start at data-points, as quickly as
possible back to the original data points. We present a series of experimental
results illustrating the soundness of the proposed approach, Variational
Walkback (VW), on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and CelebA datasets, demonstrating
superior samples compared to earlier attempts to learn a transition operator.
We also show that although each rapid training trajectory is limited to a
finite but variable number of steps, our transition operator continues to
generate good samples well past the length of such trajectories, thereby
demonstrating the match of its non-equilibrium stationary distribution to the
data distribution. Source Code: http://github.com/anirudh9119/walkback_nips17

features that allow mobile network operators (MNO) to combine multiple
component carriers (CCs) across the available spectrum to create a wider
bandwidth channel for increasing the network data throughput and overall
capacity. CA has a potential to enhance data rates and network performance in
the downlink, uplink, or both, and it can support aggregation of frequency
division duplexing (FDD) as well as time division duplexing (TDD). The
technique enables the MNO to exploit fragmented spectrum allocations and can be
utilized to aggregate licensed and unlicensed carrier spectrum as well. This
paper analyzes the performance gains and complexity level that arises from the
aggregation of three inter-band component carriers (3CC) as compared to the
aggregation of 2CC using a Vienna LTE System Level simulator. The results show
a considerable growth in the average cell throughput when 3CC aggregations are
implemented over the 2CC aggregation, at the expense of reduction in the
fairness index. The reduction in the fairness index implies that, the scheduler
has an increased task in resource allocations due to the added component
carrier. Compensating for such decrease in the fairness index could result into
scheduler design complexity. The proposed scheme can be adopted in combining
various component carriers, to increase the bandwidth and hence the data rates.

we avoid complications that arise in LES modelling in the presence of boundary
layers. We consider the motion of an LES fluid subject to a constant body force
of the Taylor-Green type as the separation between the forcing length scale and
the filter length is increased. In particular, we discuss the transition from
laminar to weakly turbulent motion, regulated by simple invariant solution, on
a grid of $32^3$ points.

not all these methods have been tested and compared in a set of problems that
can be solved using supervised machine learning algorithms. The question is
what happens to the quality of the methods if we increase the training data
size from, say, 100 MB to over 1 GB? Moreover, are quality gains worth it when
the rate of data processing diminishes? Can we trade quality for time
efficiency and recover the quality loss by just being able to process more
data? We attempt to answer these questions in a general way for text processing
tasks, considering the trade-offs involving training data size, learning time,
and quality obtained. We propose a performance trade-off framework and apply it
to three important text processing problems: Named Entity Recognition,
Sentiment Analysis and Document Classification. These problems were also chosen
because they have different levels of object granularity: words, paragraphs,
and documents. For each problem, we selected several supervised machine
learning algorithms and we evaluated the trade-offs of them on large publicly
available data sets (news, reviews, patents). To explore these trade-offs, we
use different data subsets of increasing size ranging from 50 MB to several GB.
We also consider the impact of the data set and the evaluation technique. We
find that the results do not change significantly and that most of the time the
best algorithms is the fastest. However, we also show that the results for
small data (say less than 100 MB) are different from the results for big data

radii for the primary and secondary stars were determined with accuracy levels
of approximately 2\% and 1\%, respectively, as follows: $M_{1} = 1.61 \pm 0.04$
M$_\odot$ and $M_{2} = 1.60 \pm 0.04$ M$_\odot$, $R_{1} = 1.94 \pm 0.02$
R$_\odot$ and $R_{2} = 1.93 \pm 0.02$ R$_\odot$. If its orbit is coplanar with
the eclipsing binary, the period and semimajor axis of the third body were
calculated to be $P_{3b}=4.1$ years and $a_{3b}=4.06$ au, respectively, and its
mass is $M_{3b}=0.75$ M$_\odot$. The evolutionary state of the system was
investigated by comparing the masses and radii with theoretical models. The
results demonstrate that V2281 Cyg is a detached eclipsing binary, which
consists of twin main-sequence stars with an age of 1.5 Gyr.

understanding of its strengths and limitations is hampered by the lack of rich
environments in which we can fully characterize optimal behavior, and

Here we consider a family of combinatorial games, arising from work of Erdos,
Selfridge, and Spencer, and we propose their use as environments for evaluating
and comparing different approaches to reinforcement learning. These games have
a number of appealing features: they are challenging for current learning
approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional, simply parametrized
environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution for optimal
behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be tuned by
changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these
Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games not only to compare different algorithms, but
test for generalization, make comparisons to supervised learning, analyse
multiagent play, and even develop a self play algorithm. Code can be found at:

surface energy gap in impurity-doped topological insulators. The gap at the
Dirac point and its variation with temperature were studied by using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in Cr-doped Bi2Se3. Our valence band
photoemission results revealed that the gap varies with temperature due to
residual gas condensation on the sample surface with cooling. Adsorbate on the
surface of the sample creates an electron doping effect that modifies the
chemical potential of the system resulting in the change of the gap with
variable temperature. Such electron doping can weaken the ferromagnetism and
lead to a bulk band contribution in the transport measurements. Also, a larger
energy gap is required to suppress the thermal excitations for the quantum
anomalous Hall effect. Therefore, such effects can hinder the quantum anomalous
Hall state at higher temperatures. Resolving this issue can pave the way for
enhancing the observation temperature of the quantum anomalous Hall effect.
Therefore, our findings can play a significant role in the discovery of the
high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect in impurity-doped topological
insulators.

how to solve the new LP with a new constraint efficiently. Considering the

the other player's action set, we use shadow vertex simplex method, whose
computational complexity is lower than linear with respect to the size of the

width of the nonlinear interface region is necessary to produce non-reciprocity

non-reciprocal propagation is then identified theoretically and verified
numerically. With such a resonant condition, the nonlinear interface region of
finite width behaves like a single nonlinear delta-barrier so that wave
propagations in the forward and backward directions are identical under
arbitrary incident wave intensity. As such, reciprocity re-emerges periodically
in the asymmetric nonlinear system when changing the width of interface region.
Finally, similar resonant conditions of discrete nonlinear Sch\""ordinger

designed without increasing the filter sizes with MU, which outperforms the
state of the art SR methods with a smaller number of filter parameters. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate MU into SR applications
and show promising performance results. In MU, feature maps from a previous
convolutional layer are divided into two parts along channels, which are then
compared element-wise and only their max values are passed to a next layer.
Along with some interesting properties of MU to be analyzed, we further
investigate other variants of MU and their effects. In addition, while ReLU
have a trouble for learning in networks with a very small number of
convolutional filter parameters, MU do not. For SR applications, our MU-based
network reconstructs high-resolution images with comparable quality compared to
previous deep-learning-based SR methods, with lower filter parameters.

improve the performance gain of NOMA system, a cooperative fixed

over Rician fading channels, considering the achievable rate of signals as the
performance metric. In this technique, by exploiting the concept of NOMA,
unlike the conventional method of cooperative relaying, the second time slot is
also utilized for the realization of information sent from the transmitter end.
Moreover, as the data symbols are transmitted by nodes with full power, the
compulsion of complex power allocation coefficients is precluded. In
conventional cooperative relaying systems, the receiver is only able to receive
a single bit of information, while the receiver can reliably bring in two data
symbols in two-time slots. In this regard, this scheme is able to acquire
higher achievable rate performance than existing cooperative relaying schemes
for larger channel powers over most of the transmit SNR regime. Furthermore, a
mathematical expression is also derived for the total achievable rate of
CRS-NOMA. The results are verified through Monte-Carlo simulations which
validate accuracy and consistency of the derived analytical results.

This makes BPTT both computationally impractical and biologically implausible.
For this reason, full backpropagation through time is rarely used on long

However, this usually leads to biased estimates of the gradient in which longer

algorithm, Sparse Attentive Backtracking, which might also be related to
principles used by brains to learn long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive
Backtracking learns an attention mechanism over the hidden states of the past

allows the model to learn long term dependencies while only backtracking for a

pruning filters in the interpretation of CNNs. We exploit our recently-proposed
greedy structural compression scheme that prunes filters in a trained CNN. In
our compression, the filter importance index is defined as the classification

are then iteratively pruned based on the CAR index. We demonstrate the
interpretability of CAR-compressed CNNs by showing that our algorithm prunes
filters with visually redundant pattern selectivity. Specifically, we show the
importance of shape-selective filters for object recognition, as opposed to
color-selective filters. Out of top 20 CAR-pruned filters in AlexNet, 17 of
them in the first layer and 14 of them in the second layer are color-selective
filters. Finally, we introduce a variant of our CAR importance index that
quantifies the importance of each image class to each CNN filter. We show that
the most and the least important class labels present a meaningful

analysis of stellar convective blueshift and its dependence on magnetic
activity to a larger sample of stars in order to extend the Teff range, to
study the impact of other stellar properties, and finally to improve the
comparison between observed RV jitter and expected RV variations. We estimate a
differential velocity shift for Fe and Ti lines of different depths and derive
an absolute convective blueshift using the Sun as a reference for a sample of
360 F7-K4 stars with different properties (age, Teff, metallicity). We confirm
the strong variation in convective blueshift with Teff and its dependence on
(as shown in the line list in Paper I) activity level. Although we do not
observe a significant effect of age or cyclic activity, stars with a higher
metallicity tend to have a lower convective blueshift, with a larger effect
than expected from numerical simulations. Finally, we estimate that for 71% of
the stars in our sample the RV and LogR'HK variations are compatible with the
effect of activity on convection, as observed in the solar case, while for the
other stars, other sources (such as binarity or companions) must be invoked to
explain the large RV variations. We also confirm a relationship between LogR'HK
and metallicity, which may affect discussions of the possible relationship
between metallicity and exoplanets, as RV surveys are biased toward low LogR'HK
and possibly toward high-metallicity stars. We conclude that activity and
metallicity strongly affect the small-scale convection levels in stars in the

amplitude for low-metallicity stars.

equatorial plane of Mars. Recent works have shown that they can accrete within
an impact-generated inner dense and outer light disk, and that the same impact
potentially forms the Borealis basin, a large northern hemisphere basin on the
current Mars. However, there is no a priori reason for the impact to take place
close to the north pole (Borealis present location) nor to generate a debris
disk in the equatorial plane of Mars (in which Phobos and Deimos orbit). In
this paper, we investigate these remaining issues on the giant impact origin of
the Martian moons. First, we show that the mass deficit created by the Borealis
impact basin induces a global reorientation of the planet to realign its main
moment of inertia with the rotation pole (True Polar Wander). This moves the
location of the Borealis basin toward its current location. Next, using
analytical arguments, we investigate the detailed dynamical evolution of the
eccentric inclined disk from the equatorial plane of Mars that is formed by the
Martian-moon-forming impact. We find that, as a result of precession of disk
particles due to the Martian dynamical flattening $J_{2}$ term of its gravity
field and particle-particle inelastic collisions, eccentricity and inclination
are damped and an inner dense and outer light equatorial circular disk is
eventually formed. Our results strengthen the giant impact origin of Phobos and
Deimos that can finally be tested by a future sample return mission such as
JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission.

However, there have been claims that the scenario predicts too many satellite
galaxies associated with massive galaxies compared to observations, called the
missing satellite galaxy problem. Isolated groups of galaxies hosted by
passively evolving massive early-type galaxies are ideal laboratories for
finding the missing physics in the current theory. Here we report from a deep
spectroscopic survey of such satellite systems that isolated massive early-type
galaxies with no recent star formation through wet mergers or accretion have
almost no satellite galaxies fainter than the r-band absolute magnitude of
about Mr =-14. If only early-type satellites are used, the cutoff is at
somewhat brighter magnitude of about Mr =-15. Such a cutoff has not been found
in other nearby satellite galaxy systems hosted by late-type galaxies or those

on the host-centric distance. Our observation indicates that the satellite
galaxy luminosity function is largely determined by the interaction of
satellites with the environment provided by their host, which sheds light on

synchronization in a biological system is considered as the main driving force
for adaptation, there is evidence of negative effects induced by excessive
synchronization. This indicates that coherence alone can not be enough to
explain all the structural features observed in many real-world networks. In
this work, we propose an adaptive network model where the dynamical evolution
of the node states towards synchronization is coupled with an evolution of the
link weights based on an anti-Hebbian adaptive rule, which accounts for the
presence of inhibitory effects in the system. We found that the emergent
networks spontaneously develop the structural conditions to sustain explosive
synchronization. Our results can enlighten the shaping mechanisms at the heart
of the structural and dynamical organization of some relevant biological

of thermalization, such as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model; 2) systems with
long-range interactions where the equivalence of ensembles does not always
hold; 3) systems featuring absolute negative temperatures. We show that for all
the three classes of systems a mechanical thermometer model can be designed: a
temporal average of a suitable mechanical observable of the thermometer is
sufficient to get an estimate of the system's temperature. Several interesting
lessons are learnt from our numerical study: 1) the long thermalization times
in FPU-like systems do not affect the thermometer, which is not coupled to
normal modes but to a group of microscopic degrees of freedom; 2) a thermometer
coupled to a long-range system measures its microcanonical temperature, even at
values of the total energy where its canonical temperature would be very
different; 3) a thermometer to read absolute negative temperatures must have a
bounded total energy (as the system), otherwise it heavily perturbs the system
changing the sign of its temperature. Our study shows that in order to work in
a correct way also in ""non standard"" cases, the proper model of thermometer
must have a special functional form, e.g. the kinetic part cannot be quadratic.

found that the 658 GHz velocity extent tends to be correlated with that of the
SiO maser suggesting that both emission lines are excited in circumstellar
layers close to the central star. Broad and stable line profiles are observed
at 658 GHz. This could indicate maser saturation although we have tentatively
provided first information on time variability at 658 GHz.

here we present for the first time simultaneous atomically resolved SFM and

find that the local contact potential difference is not homogeneous over all
silicon atoms, contrary to the common understanding of the work function. For
the interpretation of the data we performed density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. We explain the atomic-scale electronic features by differences in
the surface dipole distribution caused by a Smoluchowski-type effect. E.g., at
step edges the partial negative charge is larger at the lower-lying atoms
closer to the bulk than at the atoms more protruding towards the vacuum. This
is the first manifestation of such type of effect on a semiconductor surface.
The DFT images accurately reproduce the experiments even without including the
tip in the calculations. This underlines that the high-resolution KPFM images
indeed show the intrinsic properties of the surface and not only tip-surface

(NST+HT+FB) for sparse signal recovery are exceedingly effective and fast,
particularly for large scale problems. The core algorithm is shown to converge
in finitely many steps under a (preconditioned) restricted isometry condition.
In this paper, we present a new perspective to analyze the algorithm, which
turns out that the efficiency of the algorithm can be further elaborated by an
estimate of the number of iterations for the guaranteed convergence. The
convergence condition of NST+HT+FB is also improved. Moreover, an adaptive

with its convergence guarantee. The number of iterations for the finite step of

alternative detection methodology in case the usual stochastic methods are not

stochastic sampling scheme, samples are high-dimensional and subsequent
multiple-testing corrections render results overly conservative, sample sizes
are too low for asymptotic results (as e.g. the central limit theorem) to kick
in, or one cannot allow for the small probability of failure inherent to
stochastic approaches. This paper instead designs a method based on insights
from machine learning and online learning theory: this detection algorithm -
named Online FAult Detection (FADO) - comes with theoretical guarantees of its
detection capabilities. A version of the margin is found to regulate the
detection performance of FADO. A precise expression is derived for bounding the
performance, and experimental results are presented assessing the influence of
involved quantities. A case study of scene detection is used to illustrate the
approach. The technology is closely related to the linear perceptron rule,
inherits its computational attractiveness and flexibility towards various

Piecewise linear models have been actively studied to achieve both accuracy and

rule-based segmentation plus sparse linear formula) are often preferred by

demonstrate how these properties can be understood from the underlying
semiclassical dynamics even for impurities with a size of around a magnetic

vortex around the impurity that can lead to a significant renormalization of
the external microwave field which becomes strongly inhomogeneous on the scale
of a cyclotron radius around the impurity. We show that this in-homogeneity can
suppress the circular polarization dependence which is theoretically expected
for MIRO but which was not observed in MIRO experiments on semiconducting
2DEGs. Our explanation, for this so far unexplained polarization independence,
has close similarities with the Azbel'-Kaner effect in metals where the
interaction length between the microwave field and conduction electrons is much
smaller than the cyclotron radius due to skin effect generating harmonics of
the cyclotron resonance.

tiling, integration of the MPEG-Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)
standard, and viewport-aware bitrate level selection. Tiling and adaptive
streaming enable the proposed system to deliver very high-resolution 360{\deg}
video at good visual quality. Further, the proposed viewport-aware bitrate
assignment selects an optimum DASH representation for each tile in a
viewport-aware manner. The quality performance of the proposed system is
verified in simulations with varying network bandwidth using realistic view

be non-linear, and when the dimensionality is too large for human
interpretation. This tutorial explains the theory of canonical correlation
analysis including its regularised, kernel, and sparse variants. Additionally,

implementation is built on top of the model introduced here [37] which is
proven quite effective for English scene text recognition. The model follows a
segmentation-free, sequence to sequence transcription approach. The network
transcribes a sequence of convolutional features from the input image to a
sequence of target labels. This does away with the need for segmenting input
image into constituent characters/glyphs, which is often difficult for Arabic

infrastructure provisioning, public transportation, events planning, and other
domains. Monitoring city-wide mobile traffic is however a complex and costly
process that relies on dedicated probes. Some of these probes have limited
precision or coverage, others gather tens of gigabytes of logs daily, which
independently offer limited insights. Extracting fine-grained patterns involves
expensive spatial aggregation of measurements, storage, and post-processing. In
this paper, we propose a mobile traffic super-resolution technique that
overcomes these problems by inferring narrowly localised traffic consumption
from coarse measurements. We draw inspiration from image processing and design
a deep-learning architecture tailored to mobile networking, which combines
Zipper Network (ZipNet) and Generative Adversarial neural Network (GAN) models.
This enables to uniquely capture spatio-temporal relations between traffic
volume snapshots routinely monitored over broad coverage areas
(`low-resolution') and the corresponding consumption at 0.05 km $^2$ level
(`high-resolution') usually obtained after intensive computation. Experiments
we conduct with a real-world data set demonstrate that the proposed
ZipNet(-GAN) infers traffic consumption with remarkable accuracy and up to
100$\times$ higher granularity as compared to standard probing, while
outperforming existing data interpolation techniques. To our knowledge, this is
the first time super-resolution concepts are applied to large-scale mobile
traffic analysis and our solution is the first to infer fine-grained urban
traffic patterns from coarse aggregates.

binaries and neutron stars that undergo thermonuclear bursts are sensitive to

equation of state that governs their interior. Constraining this relation
accurately is thus of fundamental importance to understand the nature of dense
matter. In this context we introduce a pipeline to calculate realistic model
spectra of rotating neutron stars with hydrogen and helium atmospheres. An
arbitrarily fast rotating neutron star with a given equation of state generates
the spacetime in which the atmosphere emits radiation. We use the
Lorene/nrotstar code to compute the spacetime numerically and the ATM24 code to
solve the radiative transfer equations self-consistently. Emerging specific
intensity spectra are then ray-traced through the neutron star's spacetime from
the atmosphere to a distant observer with the Gyoto code. Here, we present and
test our fully relativistic numerical pipeline. To discuss and illustrate the
importance of realistic atmosphere models we compare our model spectra to
simpler models like the commonly used isotropic color-corrected blackbody
emission. We highlight the importance of considering realistic model-atmosphere
spectra together with relativistic ray tracing to obtain accurate predictions.
We also insist on the crucial impact of the star's rotation on the observables.
Finally, we close a controversy that has been appearing in the literature in
the recent years regarding the validity of the ATM24 code.

high count spectra to show the limitations in the model without being confused
with limitations in signal-to-noise. We find that both parameters are
well-recovered at 90% confidence with improving constraints at higher
reflection fraction, high spin, and low source height. We test spectra across a
broad range - first at 10$^6-$10$^7$ and then $\sim$10$^5$ total source counts
across the effective 3-79 keV band of NuSTAR, and discover a strong dependence
of the results on how fits are performed around the starting parameters, owing
to the complexity of the model itself. A blind fit chosen over an approach that
carries some estimates of the actual parameter values can lead to significantly
worse recovery of model parameters. We further stress on the importance to span
the space of nonlinear-behaving parameters like $log~\xi$ carefully and
thoroughly for the model to avoid misleading results. In light of selecting
fitting procedures, we recall the necessity to pay attention to the choice of
data binning and fit statistics used to test the goodness of fit by

magnetic field over multiple scales. We derive the magnetic energy spectrum --
a measure that constraints the multi-scale distribution of the magnetic energy,
and compare it with the gravitational energy spectrum derived in Li \& Burkert
(2016). In our formalism, the gravitational energy spectrum is purely
determined by the surface density PDF, and the magnetic energy spectrum is
determined by both the surface density PDF and the magnetic-field-density
relation. If regions have density PDFs close to $P(\Sigma)\sim \Sigma^{-2}$ and
a universal magnetic field-density relation $B\sim \rho^{1/2}$, we expect a
multi-scale near equipartition between gravity and the magnetic fields. This
equipartition is found to be true in NGC6334 where estimates of magnetic fields
over multiple scales (from 0.1 pc to a few parsec) are available. However, the
current observations are still limited in sample size. In the future, it is
necessary to obtain multi-scale measurements of magnetic fields from different

most compact, yet informative, representation of a set of variables, with
respect to the target. It generalizes the notion of minimal sufficient
statistics from classical parametric statistics to a broader
information-theoretic sense. The IB curve defines the optimal trade-off between
representation complexity and its predictive power. Specifically, it is
achieved by minimizing the level of mutual information (MI) between the
representation and the original variables, subject to a minimal level of MI
between the representation and the target. This problem is shown to be in
general NP hard. One important exception is the multivariate Gaussian case, for
which the Gaussian IB (GIB) is known to obtain an analytical closed form
solution, similar to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). In this work we
introduce a Gaussian lower bound to the IB curve; we find an embedding of the
data which maximizes its ""Gaussian part"", on which we apply the GIB. This
embedding provides an efficient (and practical) representation of any arbitrary
data-set (in the IB sense), which in addition holds the favorable properties of
a Gaussian distribution. Importantly, we show that the optimal Gaussian
embedding is bounded from above by non-linear CCA. This allows a fundamental

the manipulations of these exotic properties by tuning superlattice geometry,

Targets that are easy to observe and analyse naturally have more data
available, so their synodic periods are confirmed from multiple sources. Also,
thanks to availability of data from a number of apparitions, their spin and
shape models can often be obtained.
  Almost half of bright (H<=11 mag) main-belt asteroid population with known
lightcurve parameters have rotation periods considered long (P>12 hours) and
are rarely chosen for photometric observations. There is a similar selection
effect against asteroids with low lightcurve amplitudes (a_max<=0.25 mag). As a
result such targets, though numerous in this brightness range, are
underrepresented in the sample of spin and shape modelled asteroids. In the
range of fainter targets such effects are stronger. These selection effects can
influence what is now known about asteroid spin vs. size distribution, on
asteroid internal structure and densities and on spatial orientation of
asteroid spin axes.
  To reduce both biases at the same time, we started a photometric survey of a
substantial sample of those bright main-belt asteroids that displayed both
features: periods longer than 12 hours, and amplitudes that did not exceed 0.25
magnitude. First we aim at finding synodic periods of rotation, and after a few
observed apparitions, obtaining spin and shape models.
  As an initial result of our survey we found that a quarter of the studied
sample (8 out of 34 targets) have rotation periods different from those widely
accepted. We publish here these newly found period values with the lightcurves.
  The size/frequency plot might in reality look different in the long-period
range. Further studies of asteroid spins, shapes, and structure should take
into account serious biases that are present in the parameters available today.

centred occlusion (termed a rail) is introduced to provide a small
axially-uniform depth constriction. For bubbles wide enough to span the
channel, the system's behaviour is similar to that of semi-infinite fingers and
a symmetric static solution is stable. Here, we focus on smaller bubbles, in
which case the symmetric static solution is unstable and the static bubble is
displaced towards one of the deeper regions of the channel on either side of
the rail. Using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations of a
depth-averaged model, we show that a bubble propagating axially due to a small
imposed flow rate can be stabilised in a steady symmetric mode centred on the
rail through a subtle interaction between stabilising viscous forces and
destabilising surface tension forces. However, for sufficiently large capillary
numbers Ca, the ratio of viscous to surface tension forces, viscous forces in
turn become destabilising thus returning the bubble to an off-centred
propagation regime. With decreasing bubble size, the range of Ca for which
steady centred propagation is stable decreases, and eventually vanishes through
the coalescence of two supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. The depth-averaged
model is found to accurately predict all the steady modes of propagation
observed experimentally, and provides a comprehensive picture of the underlying
steady bifurcation structure. However, for sufficiently large imposed flow
rates, we find that initially centred bubbles do not converge onto a steady
mode of propagation. Instead they transiently explore weakly unstable steady
modes, an evolution which results in their break-up and eventual settling into
a steady propagating state of changed topology.

laser-induced periodic surface structuring, as a new perspective method of the
alignment of nematic liquid crystals. 920 nm periodic grooves were formed on a
Ti layer processed by means of the nonlinear laser lithography and studied as
an aligning layer. Aligning properties of the periodic structures of Ti layers
were examined by using a combined twist LC cell. In addition, the layer of the
microstructured Ti was coated with an oxidianiline-polyimide film with
annealing of the polymer film followed without any further processing. The
dependence of the twist angle of LC cells on a scanning speed and power of

anchoring energy of Ti layers with a periodic microstructure was calculated.
The maximum azimuthal anchoring energy for the microstructured Ti layer was
about 4.6*10-6 J/m2, which is comparable to the photoalignment technology. It
was found that after the deposition of a polyimide film on the periodic
microstructured Ti layer, the gain effect of the azimuthal anchoring energy to
~ 1*10-4 J/m2 is observed. Also, AFM study of aligning surfaces was carried

$\theta_{13}$ and baryon asymmetry of the Universe within the framework of an
$A_4$ flavour symmetric model. Using the conventional type I seesaw mechanism
we construct the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices which give rise to the
correct light neutrino mass matrix. Keeping the right handed neutrino mass
matrix structure trivial so that it gives rise to a (quasi) degenerate spectrum
of heavy neutrinos suitable for resonant leptogenesis at TeV scale, we generate
the non-trivial structure of Dirac neutrino mass matrix that can lead to the
light neutrino mixing through type I seesaw formula. Interestingly, such a
setup naturally leads to non-zero $\theta_{13}$ due to the existence of
anti-symmetric contraction of the product of two triplet representations of
$A_4$. Such antisymmetric part of triplet products usually vanish for right
handed neutrino Majorana mass terms, leading to $\mu-\tau$ symmetric scenarios
in the most economical setups. We constrain the model parameters from the
requirement of producing the correct neutrino data as well as baryon asymmetry
of the Universe for right handed neutrino mass scale around TeV. The $A_4$
symmetry is augmented by additional $Z_3 \times Z_2$ symmetry to make sure that
the splitting between right handed neutrinos required for resonant leptogenesis
is generated only by next to leading order terms, making it naturally small. We

flat parts and then carefully following instructions to assemble them together.
Despite its significance, this error prone and tedious process is generally
neglected in the discussion. We propose an approach for shape representation
through a single developable part that attaches to itself and requires no
assembly instructions. Our inspiration comes from the so-called zipit bags,
which are made of a single, long ribbon with a zipper around its boundary. In
order to ""assemble"" the bag, one simply needs to zip up the ribbon. Our method
operates in the same fashion, but it can be used to approximate any shape.
Given a 3D model, our algorithm produces plans for a single 2D shape that can
be laser cut in few parts from flat fabric or paper. We can then attach a
zipper along the boundary for quick assembly and disassembly, or apply more
traditional approaches, such as gluing and stitching. We show physical and

overcome these challenges to measure magneto-electroluminescence in silicon

key roles in many cellular functions ranging from cell cycle regulation to
mediation of cell extracellular matrix adhesion. Inspired by single molecule
pulling experiments on leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1),
expressed in T-cells, bound to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM), we
performed constant loading rate ($r_f$) and constant force ($F$) simulations
using the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) model to describe the mechanism of
ligand rupture from CACs. The simulations reproduce the major experimental
finding on the kinetics of the rupture process, namely, the dependence of the
most probable rupture forces ($f^*$s) on $\ln r_f$ ($r_f$ is the loading rate)
exhibits two distinct linear regimes. The first, at low $r_f$, has a shallow
slope whereas the slope at high $r_f$ is much larger, especially for
LFA-1/ICAM-1 complex with the transition between the two occurring over a
narrow $r_f$ range. Locations of the two transition states (TSs), extracted
from the simulations show an abrupt change from a high value at low $r_f$ or
$F$ to a low value at high $r_f$ or $F$. The unusual behavior in which the CACs
switch from one brittle (TS position is a constant over a range of forces)
state to another brittle state is not found in forced-rupture in other protein
complexes. We explain this novel behavior by constructing the free energy
profiles, $F(\Lambda)$s, as a function of a collective reaction coordinate
($\Lambda$), involving many key charged residues and a critical metal ion. The
TS positions in F($\Lambda) change abruptly at a critical force, demonstrating
that it, rather than the molecular extension is a good reaction coordinate. We
reveal a new mechanism for the two loading regimes observed in the rupture
kinetics in CACs.

for $x\leq k$ is an open problem. In $x$-obstruction-free protocols, processes
are required to return in executions where at most $x$ processes take steps.
The best known upper bound on the number of registers needed to solve this
problem among $n>k$ processes is $n-k+x$ registers. No general lower bound
better than $2$ was known.
  We prove that any $x$-obstruction-free protocol solving $k$-set agreement
among $n>k$ processes uses at least $\lfloor(n-x)/(k+1-x)\rfloor+1$ registers.
Our main tool is a simulation that serves as a reduction from the impossibility
of deterministic wait-free $k$-set agreement: if a protocol uses fewer
registers, then it is possible for $k+1$ processes to simulate the protocol and
deterministically solve $k$-set agreement in a wait-free manner, which is
impossible. A critical component of the simulation is the ability of simulating
processes to revise the past of simulated processes. We introduce a new
augmented snapshot object, which facilitates this.
  We also prove that any space lower bound on the number of registers used by
obstruction-free protocols applies to protocols that satisfy nondeterministic
solo termination. Hence, our lower bound of $\lfloor(n-1)/k\rfloor+1$ for the
obstruction-free ($x=1$) case also holds for randomized wait-free free
protocols. In particular, this gives a tight lower bound of exactly $n$
registers for solving obstruction-free and randomized wait-free consensus.
  Finally, our new techniques can be applied to get a space lower of $\lfloor
n/2\rfloor+1$ for $\epsilon$-approximate agreement, for sufficiently small
$\epsilon$. It requires participating processes to return values within
$\epsilon$ of each other. The best known upper bounds are
$\lceil\log(1/\epsilon)\rceil$ and $n$, while no general lower bounds were
known.

correlation effects with a proper precision, we use the approach based on the
\textit{diagrammatic expansion of the Gutzwiller wave function} (DE-GWF), which
goes beyond the renormalized mean field theory (RMFT) in a systematic manner.
As a starting point of our analysis we discuss the stability region of the SC+N
phase on the intrasite Coulomb repulsion-hole doping plane for the case of the
Hubbard model. Next, we show that the exchange interaction term enhances
superconductivity while suppresses the nematicity, whereas the intersite
Coulomb repulsion term acts in the opposite manner. The competing character of
the SC and N phases interplay is clearly visible throughout the analysis. A
universal conclusion is that the nematic phase does not survive within the
$t$-$J$-$U$ model with the value of $J$ integral typical for the high-T$_C$
cuprates ($J\approx 0.1$eV). For the sake of completeness, the effect of the
correlated hopping term is also analyzed. Thus the present discussion contains
all relevant two-site interaction terms which appear in the parametrized
one-band model within the second quantization scheme. At the end, the influence
of the higher-order terms of the diagrammatic expansion on the rotational
symmetry breaking is also shown by comparing the DE-GWF results with those

strategies have been investigated considering the varying nature of wireless

blocking strategy (IBS) and readjustment based strategy (RBS). This paper
develops and compares two CA policies with queue, which are the IBS with queue
(IBS + Q), and the RBS with queue (RBS+Q). This is in furtherance of previous
proposed work. The aim is to identifying the impact of a queuing regime on the
performance of the secondary network such that any secondary user (SU) that has
not completed its service, as an alternative to dropping or forcibly
terminating the service, it is queued in order to get another opportunity to
access the primary user (PU) channels. The performance is evaluated through a
simulation framework. The results validate that with a welldesigned queuing
regime, capacity, access and other metrics can be improved with significant
reduction in blocking and forced termination probabilities respectively.

transformers. Some research proposed EMS of sub-networks as energy routers, but
failed to consider the power flow constraints or did not converge in some

cost by eliminating expensive electronic transformers and has high efficiency
in systems with numerous nodes by considering the regional markets as
generalized nodes. We take transmission costs and congestion costs into

under some geometrical constraint such as shallowness. However, deeper inquiry
into 3D flow often finds the presence of local 2D-like structures without such

vortex lines or vanishing local helicity. Here we propose a new paradigm of
flow structure by introducing an intermediate class, termed epi-2-dimensional

epi-2D property is local, and is preserved in fluid elements obeying ideal
(inviscid and barotropic) mechanics; a local epi-2D flow may be regarded as a
`particle' carrying a generalized enstrophy as its charge. A finite viscosity
may cause `fusion' of two epi-2D particles, generating helicity from their

Pan-STARRS has observed 3/4 of the sky in grizy making future template
observations unnecessary, (3) we have a well-tested data-reduction pipeline,
and (4) we have observed ~3000 high-redshift SNe Ia on this system. Here we
present our initial sample of 225 SN Ia griz light curves, of which 180 pass
all criteria for inclusion in a cosmological sample. The Foundation Supernova
Survey already contains more cosmologically useful SNe Ia than all other
published low-redshift SN Ia samples combined. We expect that the systematic
uncertainties for the Foundation Supernova Sample will be 2-3 times smaller
than other low-redshift samples. We find that our cosmologically useful sample
has an intrinsic scatter of 0.111 mag, smaller than other low-redshift samples.
We perform detailed simulations showing that simply replacing the current

the precision on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter by 35%, and the

equations (SPDEs) typically struggle in problems with high-dimensional
inputs/outputs. Such difficulties are only amplified in large-scale
applications where even a few tens of full-order model runs are impracticable.
While dimensionality reduction can alleviate some of these issues, it is not
known which and how many features of the (high-dimensional) input are actually
predictive of the (high-dimensional) output. In this paper, we advocate a
Bayesian formulation that is capable of performing simultaneous dimension and
model-order reduction. It consists of a component that encodes the
high-dimensional input into a low-dimensional set of feature functions by
employing sparsity-enforcing priors and a decoding component that makes use of
the solution of a coarse-grained model in order to reconstruct that of the
full-order model. Both components are represented with latent variables in a
probabilistic graphical model and are simultaneously trained using Stochastic
Variational Inference methods. The model is capable of quantifying the
predictive uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place
in any model-order/dimension reduction as well as the uncertainty arising from
finite-sized training datasets. We demonstrate its capabilities in the context
of random media where fine-scale fluctuations can give rise to random inputs
with tens of thousands of variables. With a few tens of full-order model
simulations, the proposed model is capable of identifying salient physical
features and produce sharp predictions under different boundary conditions of
the full output which itself consists of thousands of components.

pairs of similar sets in rapid streams of sets. A prototypical example setting
is that of tweets. A tweet is a set of words, and Twitter emits about half a
billion tweets per day. Our solution makes it possible to efficiently maintain
the top-$k$ most similar tweets from a pair of rapid Twitter streams, e.g., to
discover similar trends in two cities if the streams concern cities.
  Using a sliding window model, the top-$k$ result changes as new sets in the
stream enter the window or existing ones leave the window. Maintaining the
top-$k$ result under rapid streams is challenging. First, when a set arrives,
it may form a new pair for the top-$k$ result with any set already in the
window. Second, when a set leaves the window, all its pairings in the top-$k$
are invalidated and must be replaced. It is not enough to maintain the $k$ most
similar pairs, as less similar pairs may eventually be promoted to the top-$k$
result. A straightforward solution that pairs every new set with all sets in
the window and keeps all pairs for maintaining the top-$k$ result is memory
intensive and too slow. We propose SWOOP, a highly scalable stream join
algorithm that solves these issues. Novel indexing techniques and sophisticated
filters efficiently prune useless pairs as new sets enter the window. SWOOP
incrementally maintains a stock of similar pairs to update the top-$k$ result
at any time, and the stock is shown to be minimal. Our experiments confirm that
SWOOP can deal with stream rates that are orders of magnitude faster than the
rates of existing approaches.

value of the Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm crit}$), from which
$\langle\varepsilon\rangle$ rapidly decreases, is dependent on both the
polytropic index ($\Gamma$) and the minimum density contrast of the gas. We
also derive Larson's first law associated with the velocity dispersion
($\langle V_{\rm rms}\rangle$) in the local star formation regions. Our model
shows good agreement with Larson's law in the $\sim 10-50\,{\rm pc}$ range,

physical layer security of video streaming in cellular networks with limited
backhaul capacity. By proactively sharing video data across a subset of base
stations (BSs) through both caching and backhaul loading, secure cooperative
joint transmission of several BSs can be dynamically enabled in accordance with
the cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul capacity. Assuming
imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, we formulate a
two-stage non-convex mixed-integer robust optimization problem for minimizing
the total transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) and
guaranteeing communication secrecy during video delivery, where the caching and
the cooperative transmission policy are optimized in an offline video caching
stage and an online video delivery stage, respectively. Although the formulated
optimization problem turns out to be NP-hard, low-complexity polynomial-time
algorithms, whose solutions are globally optimal under certain conditions, are
proposed for cache training and video delivery control. Caching is shown to be
beneficial as it reduces the data sharing overhead imposed on the
capacity-constrained backhaul links, introduces additional secure degrees of
freedom, and enables a power-efficient communication system design. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed caching scheme achieves simultaneously a low
secrecy outage probability and a high power efficiency. Furthermore, due to the

to show that density structures, extending radially over several solar radii
(Rs), are released in the forming slow solar wind approximately 4-5 Rs above
the solar surface (Sanchez-Diaz et al. 2017). We related the signatures of this
formation process to intermittent magnetic reconnection occurring continuously
above helmet streamers. We now exploit the heliospheric imagery from the Solar
Terrestrial Relation Observatory (STEREO) to map the spatial and temporal
distribution of the ejected structures. We demonstrate that streamers
experience quasi-periodic bursts of activity with the simultaneous outpouring
of small transients over a large range of latitudes in the corona. This cyclic
activity leads to the emergence of well-defined and broad structures.
Derivation of the trajectories and kinematic properties of the individual small
transients that make up these large-scale structures confirms their association
with the forming Slow Solar Wind (SSW). We find that these transients are
released, on average, every 19.5 hours, simultaneously at all latitudes with a
typical radial size of 12 Rs. Their spatial distribution, release rate and
three-dimensional extent are used to estimate the contribution of this cyclic
activity to the mass flux carried outward by the SSW. Our results suggest that,
in interplanetary space, the global structure of the heliospheric current sheet
is dominated by a succession of blobs and associated flux ropes. We
demonstrated this with an example event using STEREO-A in-situ measurements.

fermions. How such microscopic anomaly manifests itself in a macroscopic
many-body system with chiral fermions, is a highly nontrivial question that has
recently attracted significant interest. As it turns out, unusual transport
currents can be induced by chiral anomaly under suitable conditions in such
systems, with the notable example of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) where a
vector current (e.g. electric current) is generated along an external magnetic
field. A lot of efforts have been made to search for CME in heavy ion
collisions, by measuring the charge separation effect induced by the CME
transport. A crucial challenge in such effort, is the quantitative prediction
for the CME signal. In this paper, we develop the Anomalous-Viscous Fluid
Dynamics (AVFD) framework, which implements the anomalous fluid dynamics to
describe the evolution of fermion currents in QGP, on top of the neutral bulk
background described by the VISH2+1 hydrodynamic simulations for heavy ion
collisions. With this new tool, we quantitatively and systematically
investigate the dependence of the CME signal to a series of theoretical inputs
and associated uncertainties. With realistic estimates of initial conditions
and magnetic field lifetime, the predicted CME signal is quantitatively
consistent with measured change separation data in 200GeV Au-Au collisions.
Based on analysis of Au-Au collisions, we further make predictions for the CME
observable to be measured in the planned isobaric (Ru-Ru v.s. Zr-Zr ) collision
experiment, which could provide a most decisive test of the CME in heavy ion
collisions.

results in a general high-dimensional framework where the dimension $p_n$ goes
to infinity at an arbitrary rate with the sample size $n$, and where the
concentration $\kappa_n$ behaves in a completely free way with $n$, which
offers a spectrum of problems ranging from arbitrarily easy to arbitrarily
challenging ones. We identify various asymptotic regimes, depending on the
convergence/divergence properties of $(\kappa_n)$, that yield different
contiguity rates and different limiting experiments. In each regime, we derive
Le Cam optimal tests under specified $\kappa_n$ and we compute, from the Le Cam
third lemma, asymptotic powers of the classical Watson test under contiguous
alternatives. We further establish LAN results with respect to both spike

using a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb
detector at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 3$~$fb$^{-1}$. The $\tau$ lepton is reconstructed with
three charged pions in the final state. A novel method is used that exploits
the different vertex topologies of signal and backgrounds to isolate samples of
semitauonic decays of $b$ hadrons with high purity. Using the $B^0 \to
D^{*-}\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+$ decay as the normalization channel, the ratio
${\cal{B}}(B^0 \to D^{*-} \tau^+ \nu_{\tau})/{\cal{B}}(B^0 \to

first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. An average of
branching fraction measurements for the normalization channel is used to derive
${\cal{B}}(B^0 \to D^{*-} \tau^+ \nu_{\tau}) = (1.42 \pm 0.094 \pm 0.129 \pm
0.054) \%$, where the third uncertainty is due to the limited knowledge of
${\cal{B}}(B^0\to D^{*-}\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+)$. A test of lepton flavor universality
is performed using the well-measured branching fraction ${\cal{B}}(B^0 \to
D^{*-} \mu^+\nu_{\mu})$ to compute ${\cal{R}}(D^{*-}) = 0.291 \pm 0.019 \pm
0.026 \pm 0.013$, where the third uncertainty originates from the uncertainties
on ${\cal{B}}(B^0 \to D^{*-}\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+)$ and ${\cal{B}}(B^0 \to D^{*-}
\mu^+\nu_{\mu})$. This measurement is in agreement with the Standard Model
prediction and with previous measurements.

that it is part of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the QSO2 host, which has
been populated with tidal debris by galactic interactions. This rich gaseous
medium has been rendered visible due to the illumination by the powerful active
nucleus (AGN). Subsolar abundances (~0.5Z(sun)) are tentatively favored by AGN
photoionization models. We also report the detection of coronal emission (Fe+6)
from the NE bubble, at ~9 kpc from the AGN. The detection of coronal lines at
such large distances from the AGN and the [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha,
[OI]/Halpha optical emission line ratios of the giant nebula are consistent
with the fading quasar scenario proposed by Gagne et al. (2014). The fading
rate appears to have been faster in the last ~46,000 yr. Deep wide field

164 of the 362 solar flare events studied (45%) are found to have associated
global waves with no waves found for the remaining 198 (55%). A clear linear
relationship was found between the median initial velocity and the acceleration
of the waves, with faster waves exhibiting a stronger deceleration (consistent
with previous results). No clear relationship was found between global waves
and type II radio bursts, electrons or protons detected in-situ near Earth.
While no relationship was found between the wave properties and the associated
flare size (with waves produced by flares from B to X-class), more than a
quarter of the active regions studied were found to produce more than one wave
event. These results suggest that the presence of a global wave in a solar
eruption is most likely determined by the structure and connectivity of the
erupting active region and the surrounding quiet solar corona rather than by
the amount of free energy available within the active region.

very sensitive to the electronic ground-state characteristic. In the recent two
papers by Stolarczyk and Krygowski (to appear soon) a simple quantum approach,
the Augmented H\""uckel Molecular Orbital (AugHMO) model, is proposed for the
qualitative, as well as quantitative, study of this phenomenon. The simplest
realization of the AugHMO model is the H\""uckel-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (HSSH)
method, in which the resonance integral $\beta$ of the HMO model is a linear
function the bond length.
  In the present paper the HSSH method is applied in a study of carbon-carbon
bond lengths in a set of 34 selected policyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
This is exactly the set of molecules analyzed by Rieger and M\""ullen
(\textit{J. Phys. Org. Chem.} \textbf{2010}, \textit{23}, 315) in the context
of their electronic-excitation spectra. These PAHs have been obtained by
chemical synthesis, but in most cases no diffraction data (by X-rays or
neutrons) of sufficient quality is available to provide us with their geometry.
On the other hand, these PAHs are rather big (up to 96 carbon atoms), and
\textit{ab initio} methods of quantum chemistry are too expensive for reliable
geometry optimization. That makes the HSSH method a very attractive
alternative.
  Our HSSH calculations uncover a modular architecture of certain classes of
PAHs. For the studied molecules (and their fragments -- modules) we calculate
the values of the aromaticity index HOMA.

clusters. Galaxy clusters exhibit a tight correlation between the luminosity
and temperature of the X-ray-emitting intracluster medium. While the luminosity
measurement depends on cosmological parameters through the luminosity distance,
the temperature determination is cosmology-independent. We exploit this
property to test the isotropy of the luminosity distance over the full
extragalactic sky, through the normalization $a$ of the $L_X-T$ scaling
relation and the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$. We use two
almost independent galaxy cluster samples: the ASCA Cluster Catalog (ACC) and
the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS-DR1). Interestingly enough, these two samples
appear to have the same pattern for $a$ with respect to the Galactic longitude.
We also identify one sky region within $l\sim (-15^o,90^o)$ (Group A) that
shares very different best-fit values for $a$ for both samples. We find the
deviation of Group A to be $2.7\sigma$ for ACC and $3.1\sigma$ for XCS-DR1.
This tension is not relieved after excluding possible outliers or after a
redshift conversion to the CMB frame is applied. Using also the HIFLUGCS
sample, we show that a possible excess of cool-core clusters in this region,
cannot explain the obtained deviations. Moreover, we tested for a dependence of
the $L_X-T$ relation on supercluster environment. We indeed find a trend for
supercluster members to be underluminous compared to field clusters. However,
the fraction of supercluster members is similar in the different sky regions.
Constraining $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ via the redshift evolution of $L_X-T$ and the
luminosity distance, we obtain approximately the same deviation amplitudes as
for $a$. The observed behavior of $\Omega_m$ for the sky regions that coincide
with the CMB dipole is similar to what was found with other cosmological probes
as well.

the pan-sharpened image from the fused features. The TFNet mainly consists of
three parts. The first part is comprised of two networks extracting features
from PAN and MS images, respectively. The subsequent network fuses them
together to form compact features that represent both spatial and spectral

spatial resolution MS image is recovered from the fused features through an
image reconstruction network. Experiments on Quickbird and \mbox{GaoFen-1}

that in the usual case with $T_{RH}\gg m_{\rm DM}$, the production rate during

question of whether the superconducting gaps during the transition change
smoothly or steeply? We show that the behavior can be of either type and is
controlled by the ratio of intra- and interband impurity scattering and a
parameter $\sigma$ that represents a scattering strength and changes from zero
(Born approximation) to one (unitary limit). For the pure interband scattering
potential and $\sigma \lesssim 0.11$, the $s_\pm \to s_{++}$ transition is
accompanied by the steep behavior of gaps, while for larger values of $\sigma$,
gaps change smoothly. The steep behavior of the gaps occurs at low
temperatures, $T < 0.1 T_{c0}$, otherwise it is smooth. The critical
temperature $T_c$ is always a smooth function of the scattering rate in spite
of the steep changes in the behavior of the gaps.

ultra-short period hot Jupiter WASP-103 b, in addition to five new radial
velocity measurements. We combine these observations with archival data and
perform a global analysis of the resulting extensive dataset, accounting for
the contamination from a nearby star. We detect the thermal emission of the
planet in both the $z'$ and $K_{\mathrm{S}}$-bands, the measured occultation
depths being 699$\pm$110 ppm (6.4-$\sigma$) and $3567_{-350}^{+400}$ ppm
(10.2-$\sigma$), respectively. We use these two measurements together with
recently published HST/WFC3 data to derive joint constraints on the properties
of WASP-103 b's dayside atmosphere. On one hand, we find that the $z'$-band and
WFC3 data are best fit by an isothermal atmosphere at 2900 K or an atmosphere
with a low H$_2$O abundance. On the other hand, we find an unexpected excess in
the $K_{\mathrm{S}}$-band measured flux compared to these models, which
requires confirmation with additional observations before any interpretation
can be given. From our global data analysis, we also derive a broad-band
optical transmission spectrum that shows a minimum around 700 nm and increasing
values towards both shorter and longer wavelengths. This is in agreement with a
previous study based on a large fraction of the archival transit light curves
used in our analysis. The unusual profile of this transmission spectrum is
poorly matched by theoretical spectra and is not confirmed by more recent
observations at higher spectral resolution. Additional data, both in emission
and transmission, are required to better constrain the atmospheric properties
of WASP-103 b.

to catch qualitative properties of reaction networks that the deterministic

The expressions for the gradient and Hessian corresponding to either problem
contain expected value operators. Due to the large number of uncertainties
considered in our model, we suggest to evaluate these expectations using a
multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that
this results in the gradient and Hessian corresponding to the MLMC estimator of
the original cost functional. Furthermore, we show that the use of certain
correlated samples yields a reduction in the total number of samples required.
Two optimization methods are investigated: the nonlinear conjugate gradient

dynamically decides which and how many samples should be taken in each
iteration. The cost of the optimization up to some specified tolerance $\tau$
is shown to be proportional to the cost of a gradient evaluation with requested
root mean square error $\tau$. The algorithms are tested on a model elliptic

Initially isotropic Alfv\`enic fluctuations rapidly develop a strongly
anisotropic turbulent cascade, mainly in the direction perpendicular to the
ambient magnetic field. The omnidirectional magnetic field spectrum shows a
double power-law behavior over almost two decades in wavenumber, with a
Kolmogorov-like index at large scales, a spectral break around ion scales, and
a steepening at sub-ion scales. Power laws are also observed in the spectra of
the ion bulk velocity, density, and electric field, both at magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) and at kinetic scales. Despite the complex structure, the omnidirectional
spectra of all fields at ion and sub-ion scales are in remarkable quantitative
agreement with those of a two-dimensional (2D) simulation with similar physical
parameters. This provides a partial, a-posteriori validation of the 2D
approximation at kinetic scales. Conversely, at MHD scales, the spectra of the
density and of the velocity (and, consequently, of the electric field) exhibit
differences between the 2D and 3D cases. Although they can be partly ascribed
to the lower spatial resolution, the main reason is likely the larger
importance of compressible effects in a full geometry. Our findings are also in
remarkable quantitative agreement with solar wind observations.

The effective heat capacity method is used for simulation of phase change in
bio-heat transfer equation to take into account the latent heat of phase
transition. The bio-heat transfer equation is solved by using element free
Galerkin method (EFGM) to simulate the phase change problem of biological

interactions of the accretion-flow components. We offer a promising window into
the disc--corona interaction through analysing the formation regions of the
disc aperiodic variabilities with different time-scales via comparing the
corresponding transition energies of the amplitude-ratio spectra. In a previous
paper, we analysed the Fourier power density as a function of energy and
frequency to study the origin of the aperiodic variability, and combined that
analysis with the phase lag as a function of frequency to derive a picture of
the disc--corona interaction in this source. We here, for the first time,
investigate the phase lag as a function of energy and frequency, and display
some interesting details of the disc--corona interaction. Besides, the results

function \[{}_0\Psi_1(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{z^n}{\Gamma(an+b) n!},\] where
$a>-1$ and $b$ is any number (real or complex), may be obtained by exploiting
the well-established asymptotic theory of the generalised Wright function
${}_p\Psi_q(z)$. A summary of this theory is given and an algorithm for
determining the coefficients in the associated exponential expansions is
discussed in an appendix. We pay particular attention to the case $a=-1/2$,
where the expansion for $z\to\pm\infty$ consists of an exponentially small
contribution that undergoes a Stokes phenomenon.
  We also examine the different nature of the asymptotic expansions as a
function of $\arg\,z$ when $-1<a<0$, taking into account the Stokes phenomenon
that occurs on the rays $\arg\,z=0$ and $\arg\,z=\pm\pi(1+a)$ for the
associated function ${}_1\Psi_0(z)$. These regions are more precise than those
given by Wright in his 1940 paper. Numerical computations are carried to verify
several of the expansions developed in the paper.

report on the atomic structure of the vicinal Si(111) surface with 10 degree
miscut investigated by a joint frequency-modulation scanning force microscopy
(FM-SFM) and ab initio approach. This popular stepped surface contains 7 x
7-reconstructed terraces oriented along the Si(111) direction, separated by a
stepped region. Recently, the atomic structure of this triple step based on
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images has been subject of debate. Unlike
STM, SFM atomic resolution capability arises from chemical bonding of the tip
apex with the surface atoms. Thus, for surfaces with a corrugated density of
states such as semiconductors, SFM provides complementary information to STM
and partially removes the dependency of the topography on the electronic
structure. Our FM-SFM images with unprecedented spatial resolution on steps
confirm the model based on a (7 7 10) orientation of the surface and reveal
structural details of this surface. Two different FM-SFM contrasts together
with density functional theory calculations explain the presence of defects,
buckling and filling asymmetries on the surface. Our results evidence the
important role of charge transfers between adatoms, restatoms, and dimers in
the stabilisation of the structure of the vicinal surface.

  Management",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systems can become misconfigured for a variety of reasons such as operator
errors or buggy patches. When a misconfiguration is discovered, usually the
first order of business is to restore availability, often by undoing the
misconfiguration. To simplify this task, we propose the Statistical Analysis
for Identifying Configuration Files (SAIC), which analyzes how the contents of
a file changes over time to automatically determine which files contain
configuration state. In this way, SAIC reduces the number of files a user must
manually examine during recovery and allows versioning file systems to make
more efficient use of their versioning storage.
  The two key insights that enable SAIC to identify configuration files are
that configuration state must persist across executions of an application and
that configuration state changes at a slower rate than other types of
application state. SAIC applies these insights through a set of filters, which
eliminate non-persistent files from consideration, and a novel similarity
metric, which measures how similar a file's versions are to each other.
Together, these two mechanisms enable SAIC to identify all 72 configuration
files out of 2363 versioned files from 6 common applications in two user
traces, while mistaking only 33 non-configuration files as configuration files,
which allows a versioning file system to eliminate roughly 66% of
non-configuration file versions from its logs, thus reducing the number of file
versions that a user must try to recover from a misconfiguration.

  Consider a function $g\colon\omega\to [0,\infty)$ such that

Then the family $\mathcal{Z}_g=\{A\subseteq\omega:\
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\text{card}(A\cap n)}{g(n)}=0\}$ is an ideal called
simple density ideal (or ideal associated to upper density of weight $g$). We
compare this class of ideals with Erd\H{o}s-Ulam ideals. In particular, we show
that there are $\sqsubseteq$-antichains of size $\mathfrak{c}$ among
Erd\H{o}s-Ulam ideals which are and are not simple density ideals.

containing the classical ideal of sets of asymptotic density zero. We also
characterize Erd\H{o}s-Ulam ideals which are simple density ideals. In the

  Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as the method of choice for solving
a wide range of machine learning tasks. The enormous computational demands
posed by DNNs have most commonly been addressed through the design of custom
accelerators. However, these accelerators are prohibitive in many design
scenarios (e.g., wearable devices and IoT sensors), due to stringent area/cost
constraints. Accelerating DNNs on these low-power systems, comprising of mainly
the general-purpose processor (GPP) cores, requires new approaches. We improve
the performance of DNNs on GPPs by exploiting a key attribute of DNNs, i.e.,
sparsity. We propose Sparsity aware Core Extensions (SparCE)- a set of
micro-architectural and ISA extensions that leverage sparsity and are minimally
intrusive and low-overhead. We dynamically detect zero operands and skip a set
of future instructions that use it. Our design ensures that the instructions to
be skipped are prevented from even being fetched, as squashing instructions
comes with a penalty. SparCE consists of 2 key micro-architectural
enhancements- a Sparsity Register File (SpRF) that tracks zero registers and a
Sparsity aware Skip Address (SASA) table that indicates instructions to be
skipped. When an instruction is fetched, SparCE dynamically pre-identifies
whether the following instruction(s) can be skipped and appropriately modifies
the program counter, thereby skipping the redundant instructions and improving
performance. We model SparCE using the gem5 architectural simulator, and
evaluate our approach on 6 image-recognition DNNs in the context of both
training and inference using the Caffe framework. On a scalar microprocessor,
SparCE achieves 19%-31% reduction in application-level. We also evaluate SparCE
on a 4-way SIMD ARMv8 processor using the OpenBLAS library, and demonstrate
that SparCE achieves 8%-15% reduction in the application-level execution time.

naturally to the unidirectional macroscopic time evolution, independent of the
internal interactions and how far the system is from equilibrium. We also
