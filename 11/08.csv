matrices, have been used to provide lower and upper bounds on the modulus of
any root of a polynomial $p(x)$. In this paper we explore new bounds obtained
from taking the $1$-norm and $\infty$-norm of a matrix in the wider class of
intercyclic companion matrices. As is the case with Fiedler matrices, we
observe that the new bounds from intercyclic companion matrices can improve
those from the Frobenius matrix by at most a factor of two. By using the
Hessenberg form of an intercyclic companion matrix, we describe how to
determine the best upper bound when restricted to Fiedler companion matrices
using the $\infty$-norm. We also obtain a new general bound by considering the
polynomial $x^qp(x)$ for $q>0$. We end by considering upper bounds obtained
from inverses of monic reversal polynomials of intercyclic companion matrices,
noting that these can make more significant improvements on the bounds from a
Frobenius companion matrix for certain polynomials.

how strict overlap restricts global discrepancies between the covariate

helps the group improve its properly defined collective accuracy. We quantify
the improvement of the group estimation when additional controlled and reliable

sensitivity to social influence permits to define five robust behavioral traits
and increases with the difference between personal and group estimates. We then
use our data to build and calibrate a model of collective estimation, to
analyze the impact on the group performance of the quantity and quality of
information received by individuals. The model quantitatively reproduces the
distributions of estimates and the improvement of collective performance and

counterbalance the human cognitive bias to systematically underestimate

G+K+M-types vs. F-types and giants. We also detect a tail of stars with high

non-empty phase in which there are infinite light clusters, which implies the
existence of a non-empty phase in which there are infinitely many infinite
clusters. That is, we show that $p_c<p_h \leq p_u$ for any such graph. This
answers a question of Haggstrom, Peres, and Schonmann (1999), and verifies the
nonunimodular case of a well-known conjecture of Benjamini and Schramm (1996).
We also prove that the triangle condition holds at criticality on any such

features had only previously been established for $d=1$, $k$ large.

controlled by a combination of frequency shifts induced by ambient temperature

but controls mainly the power of the solitons. At large initial detuning and
high threshold gain, the first observed structure can be a high order soliton.
In real devices spatial disorder in the cavity length causes a pinning of
solitons and a dispersion of thresholds. The experimental observations are in
good agreement with numerical simulations taking into account disorder and the
coupling of gain and cavity resonance due to Joule heating. In particular, we
demonstrate that the existence of the traps explain the spontaneous switch on

products to offer potential customers, such as stocking the shelves in a
convenience store. The price of each product is fixed in advance, and a
probabilistic choice function describes which product a customer will choose
from any given subset. We introduce the combinatorial assortment problem, where
each customer may select a bundle of products. We consider a model of consumer
choice where the relative value of different bundles is described by a
valuation function, while individual customers may differ in their absolute
willingness to pay, and study the complexity of the resulting optimization
problem. We show that any sub-polynomial approximation to the problem requires
exponentially many demand queries when the valuation function is XOS, and that
no FPTAS exists even for succinctly-representable submodular valuations. On the
positive side, we show how to obtain constant approximations under a
""well-priced"" condition, where each product's price is sufficiently high. We
also provide an exact algorithm for $k$-additive valuations, and show how to
extend our results to a learning setting where the seller must infer the
customers' preferences from their purchasing behavior.

sufficient applied voltage, resulting in a nontrivial out-of-plane deformation.
We study this situation numerically using a nonlinear elastic model which
decouples two of the principal electrostatic stresses acting on an elastomer:
normal pressure due to the mutual attraction of oppositely charged electrodes
and tangential shear (""fringing"") due to repulsion of like charges at the
electrode edges. These enter via physically simplified boundary conditions that
are applied in a fixed reference domain using a nondimensional approach. The
method is valid for small to moderate strains and is straightforward to
implement in a generic nonlinear elasticity code. We validate the model by
directly comparing the simulated equilibrium shapes with the experiment. For
circular electrodes which buckle axisymetrically, the shape of the deflection
profile is captured. Annular electrodes of different widths produce azimuthal
ripples with wavelengths that match our simulations. In this case, it is
essential to compute multiple equilibria because the first model solution
obtained by the nonlinear solver (Newton's method) is often not the
energetically favored state. We address this using a numerical technique known
as ""deflation"". Finally, we observe the large number of different solutions

The X-shooter archive of several thousand telluric star spectra was
skimmed for Be and Be-shell stars to derive the stellar fundamental parameters

An adapted version of the BCD method is used, utilizing the Balmer
discontinuity parameters to determine effective temperature and surface
gravity. This method is optimally suited for late B stars. The projected
rotational velocity was obtained by profile fitting to the Mg ii lines of the
targets, and the spectra were inspected visually for the presence of peculiar
features such as the infrared Ca ii triplet or the presence of a double Balmer
discontinuity. The Balmer line equivalent widths were measured, but due to
uncertainties in determining the photospheric contribution are useful only in a
subsample of Be stars for determining the pure emission contribution. Results.
A total of 78 Be stars, mostly late type ones, were identified in the X-shooter
telluric standard star archive, out of which 48 had not been reported before.
The general trend of late type Be stars having more tenuous disks and being
less variable than early type ones is confirmed. The relatively large number
(48) of relatively bright (V > 8.5) additional Be stars casts some doubt on the
statistics of late type Be stars; they are more common than currently thought:

paper we study the more general case when the noise has magnitude $\alpha F(x)
+ \beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta > 0$, and present a polynomial time algorithm
that finds an approximate minimizer of $F$ for this noise model. Previously,
Markov chains, such as the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, have been
used to arrive at approximate solutions to these optimization problems.
However, for the noise model considered in this paper, no single temperature
allows such a Markov chain to both mix quickly and concentrate near the global
minimizer. We bypass this by combining ""simulated annealing"" with the
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and gradually decreasing the temperature
of the chain in order to approach the global minimizer. As a corollary one can
approximately minimize a nonconvex function that is close to a convex function;
however, the closeness can deteriorate as one moves away from the optimum.

  on networks",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Through the lens of game theory, cooperation is frequently considered an
unsustainable strategy: if an entire population is cooperating, each indi-
vidual can increase its overall fitness by choosing not to cooperate, thereby
still receiving all the benefit of its cooperating neighbors while no longer
expending its own energy. Observable cooperation in naturally-occurring public
goods games is consequently of great interest, as such systems offer insight
into both the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Here we consider a
population that obeys a public goods game on a network of discrete regions
(that we call nests), between any two of which individuals are free to migrate.
We construct a system of piecewise-smooth ordinary differential equations that
couple the within-nest population dynamics and the between-nest migratory
dynamics. Through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show
that if the workers within the population migrate sufficiently fast relative to
the cheaters, the network loses stability first through a Hopf bifurcation,
then a torus bifurcation, after which one or more nests collapse. Our results
indicate that fast moving cheaters can act to stabilize worker-cheater
coexistence within network that would otherwise collapse. We end with a
comparison of our results with the dynamics observed in colonies of the ant
species Pristomyrmex punctatus and in those of the Cape honeybee Apis mellifera
capensis, and argue that they qualitatively agree.

solution for the increasing problem of software complexity. Communities of
distributed autonomous computing entities that are capable of collaborating,
negotiating and acting to solve complex organisational and system management
problems are an attractive proposition. Central to this is the requirement for
agents to possess the capability of interacting with one another in a
structured, consistent and organised manner.
  This thesis presents the Agent Conversation Reasoning Engine (ACRE), which
constitutes a holistic view of communication management for MASs. ACRE is
intended to facilitate the practical development, debugging and deployment of
communication-heavy MASs.
  ACRE has been formally defined in terms of its operational semantics, and a
generic architecture has been proposed to facilitate its integration with a
wide variety of diverse agent development frameworks and Agent Oriented
Programming (AOP) languages. A concrete implementation has also been developed
that uses the Agent Factory AOP framework as its base. This allows ACRE to be
used with a number of different AOP languages, while providing a reference
implementation that other integrations can be modelled upon. A standard is also
proposed for the modelling and sharing of agent-focused interaction protocols
that is independent of the platform within which a concrete ACRE implementation
is run.
  Finally, a user evaluation illustrates the benefits of incorporating
conversation management into agent programming.

corresponds to the BMS$_{3}$ algebra, and then discuss its description in terms
of the Riemannian geometry of locally flat spacetimes in three dimensions. The
analysis is performed in terms of two-dimensional gauge fields for $isl(2,R)$.
Although the algebra is not semisimple, the formulation can be carried out \`a
la Drinfeld-Sokolov because it admits a nondegenerate invariant bilinear
metric. The hierarchy turns out to be bi-Hamiltonian, labeled by a nonnegative
integer $k$, and defined through a suitable generalization of the Gelfand-Dikii
polynomials. The symmetries of the hierarchy are explicitly found. For $k\geq
1$, the corresponding conserved charges span an infinite-dimensional Abelian
algebra without central extensions, and they are in involution; while in the
case of $k=0$, they generate the BMS$_{3}$ algebra. In the special case of
$k=1$, by virtue of a suitable field redefinition and time scaling, the field
equations are shown to be equivalent to a specific type of the Hirota-Satsuma
coupled KdV systems. For $k\geq 1$, the hierarchy also includes the so-called
perturbed KdV equations as a particular case. A wide class of analytic
solutions is also explicitly constructed for a generic value of $k$.
Remarkably, the dynamics can be fully geometrized so as to describe the
evolution of spacelike surfaces embedded in locally flat spacetimes. Indeed,
General Relativity in 3D can be endowed with a suitable set of boundary
conditions, so that the Einstein equations precisely reduce to the ones of the
hierarchy aforementioned. The symmetries of the integrable systems then arise
as diffeomorphisms that preserve the asymptotic form of the spacetime metric,
and therefore, they become Noetherian. The infinite set of conserved charges is
recovered from the corresponding surface integrals in the canonical approach.

relation implies the absence of a q^2 threshold for the production of a
tachyonic neutrino-antineutrino pair, thus leading to the dominant additional
energy loss mechanism for an oncoming tachyonic neutrino in the medium-energy

it is also impossible in generalised probabilistic theories (under a small set

location-based services (LBS). Global Positioning System (GPS) becomes invalid

develop a real-time high-accuracy localization approach for smartphones.
However, accurate localization is challenging due to issues such as real-time
response requirements, limited fingerprint samples and mobile device storage.
To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning architecture:
Tensor-Generative Adversarial Network (TGAN).
  We first introduce a transform-based 3D tensor to model fingerprint samples.
Instead of those passive methods that construct a fingerprint database as a
prior, our model applies artificial neural network with deep learning to train
network classifiers and then gives out estimations. Then we propose a novel
tensor-based super-resolution scheme using the generative adversarial network
(GAN) that adopts sparse coding as the generator network and a residual
learning network as the discriminator. Further, we analyze the performance of
tensor-GAN and implement a trace-based localization experiment, which achieves
better performance. Compared to existing methods for smartphones indoor
positioning, that are energy-consuming and high demands on devices, TGAN can
give out an improved solution in localization accuracy, response time and
implementation complexity.

addition, every supernova that exhibits the absorption lines of hydrogen has
one main light-curve peak, or a plateau in luminosity, lasting approximately
100 days before declining. Here we report observations of iPTF14hls, an event
that has spectra identical to a hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova, but
characteristics that differ extensively from those of known supernovae. The
light curve has at least five peaks and remains bright for more than 600 days;
the absorption lines show little to no decrease in velocity; and the radius of
the line-forming region is more than an order of magnitude bigger than the

characteristics are consistent with a shell of several tens of solar masses
ejected by the star at supernova-level energies a few hundred days before a
terminal explosion. Another possible eruption was recorded at the same position
in 1954. Multiple energetic pre-supernova eruptions are expected to occur in
stars of 95-130 solar masses, which experience the pulsational pair

of hydrogen, or the energetics observed here. Another mechanism for the violent
ejection of mass in massive stars may be required.

show that the tree level $2\to 2$ scattering amplitude in the 3d ${\cal N}=2$

superconformal symmetry that we demonstrate in this paper is all loop exact.
This is unlike the previously studied highly supersymmetric theories where dual
superconformal symmetry is anomalous at loop levels.
  Furthermore, we reverse the argument to study the extent to which dual
superconformal invariance fixes the scattering amplitude in an ${\cal N}=2$
supersymmetric theory. We demonstrate that requiring the dual superconformal
invariance completely fixes the momentum dependence of the $2\to2$ amplitude,
while the coupling constant dependence remain unfixed. Further, we use a
combination of parity invariance, unitarity and self-duality of the amplitude
to constrain the coupling dependence of scattering amplitude.

growth stage of the small-scale dynamo. To our knowledge this is the first time
that this is seen in cosmological simulations of the intracluster medium. Our
mock observations of Faraday Rotation provide a good match to observations of
the Coma cluster. However, the distribution of magnetic fields shows strong
departures from a simple Maxwellian distribution, suggesting that the
three-dimensional structure of magnetic fields in real clusters may be
significantly different than what is usually assumed when inferring magnetic
field values from rotation measure observations.

Surface brightness profiles of inner and outer cluster members are fit using

future tests of galaxy models, we refine and assess a method to measure galaxy
biasing as function of physical scale $k$ with weak gravitational lensing. This
method enables us to reconstruct the galaxy bias factor $b(k)$ as well as the
galaxy-matter correlation $r(k)$ on spatial scales between $0.01\,h\,{\rm
Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim k\lesssim10\,h\,{\rm

In the refinement, we account for an intrinsic alignment of source
ellipticities, and we correct for the magnification bias of the lens galaxies,
relevant for the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, to improve the accuracy of the
reconstructed $r(k)$. For simulated data, the reconstructions achieve an
accuracy of $3-7\%$ (68\% confidence level) over the above $k$-range for a
survey area and a typical depth of contemporary ground-based surveys.
Realistically the accuracy is, however, probably reduced to about $10-15\%$,
mainly by systematic uncertainties in the assumed intrinsic source alignment,
the fiducial cosmology, and the redshift distributions of lens and source
galaxies (in that order). Furthermore, our reconstruction technique employs
physical templates for $b(k)$ and $r(k)$ that elucidate the impact of central
galaxies and the halo-occupation statistics of satellite galaxies on the
scale-dependence of galaxy bias, which we discuss in the paper. In a first
demonstration, we apply this method to previous measurements in the
Garching-Bonn-Deep Survey and give a physical interpretation of the lens
population.

of the 3-point correlation function of the co-moving curvature perturbations
valid in the case that these do not freeze after horizon crossing. This leads
to a generalized version of Maldacena's non-Gaussian consistency relation in
the sense that the bispectrum squeezed limit is completely determined by
spacetime diffeomorphisms. Just as in the case of the standard consistency
relation, this result may be understood as the consequence of how
long-wavelength modes modulate those of shorter wavelengths. This relation
allows one to derive the well known violation to the consistency relation
encountered in ultra slow-roll, where curvature perturbations grow
exponentially after horizon crossing.

transit modeling code simuTrans to reproduce the transit light curve of
Kepler-13Ab by separately analyzing phase-folded transits for 12 short-cadence
Kepler quarters. We verify the temporal change in impact parameter indicative
of spin-orbit precession identified by Szab\'o et al. (2012) and Masuda (2015),
reporting a rate of change $db/dt = (-4.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-5}$ day$^{-1}$.
We further investigate the effect of light dilution on the fitted impact
parameter and find that less than 1% of additional light is sufficient to
explain the seasonal variation seen in the Kepler quarter data. We then extend
our precession analysis to the phase curve data from which we report a rate of
change $db/dt = (-3.2 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{-5}$ day$^{-1}$. This value is
consistent with that of the transit data at a lower significance and provides

decaying in the presence of positive curvature on sufficiently large scales. I
report the first comprehensive scaling analysis of the small-to-intermediate
scale spectral dimension for the test case of the causal dynamical

dimension scales trivially with the diffusion constant. I find that the
spectral dimension is completely finite in the infinite volume limit, and I
argue that its maximal value is exactly consistent with the topological

regimes: a low-frequency regime where the storage modulus $G^{\prime}(\omega)$
displays a constant value $G_{\text{eq}}$, and a high-frequency power-law
stiffening regime, where $G^{\prime}(\omega) \sim \omega^{n}$. Recently, by

of stars in M31's halo is found to decrease only mildly with projected radius,
from 108 km/s in the innermost radial bin (8.2 to 14.1 kpc) to $\sim 80$ to 90
km/s at projected radii of $\sim 40$ to 130 kpc, and can be parameterized with
a power-law of slope $-0.12\pm 0.05$. The quoted uncertainty on the power-law
slope reflects only the precision of the method, although other sources of

GRBs are found in low-mass, metal-poor galaxies which constitute the
sub-luminous population of star-forming galaxies. For the host galaxy of the
GRB presented here we derive a stellar mass of $\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) = 9.80\pm
0.07$, a roughly solar metallicity (12+log(O/H) = $8.74\pm 0.12$) based on
emission line diagnostics, and an infrared luminosity of $M_{3.6/(1+z)} =
-21.94$ mag, but find it to be dust-poor ($E(B-V) < 0.05$ mag). This
establishes the galaxy hosting GRB 160804A as one of the most luminous, massive
and metal-rich GRB hosts at z < 1.5. Furthermore, the gas-phase metallicity is
found to be representative of the physical conditions of the gas close to the
explosion site of the burst. The high metallicity of the host galaxy is also
observed in absorption, where we detect several strong FeII transitions as well
as MgII and MgI. While host galaxy absorption features are common in GRB
afterglow spectra, we detect absorption from strong metal lines directly in the
host continuum (at a time when the afterglow was contributing to < 15%).

associated with the dimerization instability is identified in the Raman data

is consistent with results of spin-polarized density functional theory
calculations using the low- and high-temperature structures. Above the

increase gradually up to the maximum measurement temperature of 780 K, with a

from most classical low-level image segmentation methods that are known to be
very sensitive to the noise and occlusions, we propose a new supervised
learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implicitly

this challenging problem. More specifically, we first propose a Fully
Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate the skeleton of curve structures and at
each skeleton pixel, a scale value is estimated to reflect the local curve
width. Then we propose a dense prediction network to refine the estimated curve
skeletons. Based on the estimated scale values, we finally develop an adaptive
thresholding algorithm to achieve the final segmentation of curve structures.
In the experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on a

states (inactive, active), and nodes in the inactive state make an irreversible
transition to the active state, as soon as their precursors satisfy a
predetermined condition. We introduce a set of recursive equations to compute
the probability of reaching any final state, given an initial state, and a
specification of the transition probability function of each node. Because the
naive recursive approach for solving these equations takes factorial time in
the number of nodes, we also introduce an accelerated algorithm, built around a
breath-first search procedure. This algorithm solves the equations as
efficiently as possible, in exponential time.

maps of a finite polyhedron $X$ is extended to $n$-valued maps by replacing
liftings to universal covering spaces by liftings with codomain an orbit
configuration space, a structure recently introduced by Xicot\'encatl. The
liftings of an $n$-valued map $f$ split into self-maps of the universal
covering space of $X$ that we call lift-factors. An equivalence relation is
defined on the lift-factors of $f$ and the number of equivalence classes is the
Reidemeister number of $f$. The fixed point classes of $f$ are the projections
of the fixed point sets of the lift-factors and are the same as those of
Schirmer. An equivalence relation is defined on the fundamental group of $X$
such that the number of equivalence classes equals the Reidemeister number. We
prove that if $X$ is a manifold of dimension at least three, then algebraically
the orbit configuration space approach is the same as one utilizing the
universal covering space. The Jiang subgroup is extended to $n$-valued maps as
a subgroup of the group of covering transformations of the orbit configuration
space and used to find conditions under which the Nielsen number of an
$n$-valued map equals its Reidemeister number. If an $n$-valued map splits into
$n$ single-valued maps, then its $n$-valued Reidemeister number is the sum of
their Reidemeister numbers.

from 10^18.0 to 10^20.0 V, for L_coh = 30 pc and 100 pc. We check the
sensitivity of UHECR deflections to the particular realization of the random
field, for 3 rigidity values. For each rigidity and field model studied, the
UHECR arrival direction distribution is determined for an arbitrary source
direction, by inverting the trajectories of > 5 x 10^7 isotropic anti-CRs of
the given rigidity. We present skyplots and tables characterizing the arrival
directions, for representative 1 deg sources. Except at high rigidity, the
pattern of multiple images is very complex and depends strongly on the
coherence length and source direction. For almost all sources, average
deflections grow rapidly as the rigidity falls below 10 EV and deflections
commonly are greater than 90 deg. Magnification and demagnification can be
strong at almost all rigidities, and varies significantly with source
direction. Much of the extragalactic celestial sphere, behind and south of the

deflections obtained with the coherent field alone can be significantly

Here we present a detailed photometric analysis based on ESO-FORS2 images of
three candidate cluster multiplets in the LMC, namely SL349-SL353,
SL385-SL387-NGC1922 and NGC1836-BRHT4b-NGC1839. For each cluster we derived
ages, structural parameters and morphological properties. We have also
estimated the degree of filling of their Roche lobe, as an approximate tool to
measure the strength of the tidal perturbations induced by the LMC. We find
that the members of the possible pairs SL349-SL353 and BRHT4b-NGC1839 have a
similar age ($t = 1.00 \pm 0.12$ Gyr and $t = 140 \pm 15$ Myr, respectively),
thus possibly hinting to a common origin of their member systems We also find
that all candidate pairs in our sample show evidence of intra-cluster
overdensities that can be a possible indication of real binarity. Particularly
interesting is the case of SL349-SL353. In fact, SL353 is relatively close to
the condition of critical filling, thus suggesting that these systems might
actually constitute an energetically bound pair. It is therefore key to pursue
a detailed kinematic screening of such clusters, without which, at present, we
do not dare making a conclusive statement about the true nature of this
putative pair.

major drawback: Privacy policies that define what constitutes data leakage
cannot be seamlessly defined and enforced across heterogeneous forms of
communication. Administrators have the dual burden of: (1) manually
self-interpreting policies from handbooks to specify rules (which is
error-prone); (2) extracting relevant information flows from heterogeneous
communication protocols and enforcing policies to determine which flows should
be admissible. To address these issues, we present the Verifiable and
ACtionable Contextual Integrity Norms Engine (VACCINE), a framework for
building adaptable and modular DLP systems. VACCINE relies on (1) the theory of
contextual integrity to provide an abstraction layer suitable for specifying
reusable protocol-agnostic leakage prevention rules and (2) programming
language techniques to check these rules against correctness properties and to
enforce them faithfully within a DLP system implementation. We applied VACCINE
to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and Enron Corporation privacy
regulations. We show that by using contextual integrity in conjunction with
verification techniques, we can effectively create reusable privacy rules with
specific correctness guarantees, and check the integrity of information flows
against these rules. Our experiments in emulated enterprise settings indicate
that VACCINE improves over current DLP system design approaches and can be
deployed in enterprises involving tens of thousands of actors.

for temporal changes using New Horizons images was completed. Images that
covered the same region were blinked and manually inspected for any differences
in appearance. The search included full-disk images such that all illuminated
regions of both bodies were investigated and higher resolution images such that
parts of the encounter hemispheres were investigated at finer spatial scales.
Changes of appearance between different images were observed but in all cases
were attributed to variability of the imaging parameters (especially geometry)
or artifacts. No differences of appearance that are strongly indicative of a
temporal change were found on the surface or in the atmosphere of either Pluto
or Charon. Limits on temporal changes as a function of spatial scale and
temporal interval during the New Horizons encounter are determined. The longest
time interval constraint is one Pluto/Charon rotation period (~6.4 Earth days).
Contrast reversal and high-phase bright features that change in appearance with
solar phase angle are identified. The change of appearance of these features is
most likely due to the change in phase angle rather than a temporal change. Had
active plumes analogous to the plumes discovered on Triton been present on the

duplex (TDD) network. We characterize the queuing stability region of a network
model that consists of two types of communications: (i) users communicating
with the base station and (ii) users communicating with each other by passing
through the base station. When a communication passes through the base station
(BS) then a packet cannot be delivered to the destination UE until it is first
received by the BS queue from the source UE. Due to the relaying functionality
at the BS level, a coupling is created between the queues of the source users
and the BS queues. In addition, contrarily to the majority of the existing
works where an ON/OFF model of transmission is considered, we assume a link
adaptation model (i.e. multiple rate model) where the bit rate of a link
depends on its radio conditions. The coupling between the queues as well as the
multiple rate model are the main challenges that highly increase the complexity
of the stability region characterization. In this paper, we propose a simple
approach that permits to overcome these challenges and to provide a full
characterization of the exact stability region as a convex polytope with a
finite number of vertices. An approximated model is proposed for reducing the
computational complexity of the exact stability region. For the multi-user
scenario, a trade-off is established between the complexity and the preciseness
of the approximated stability region compared to the exact one. Furthermore,
numerical results are presented to corroborate our claims.

algorithmically construct a trisection, which describes a $4$-dimensional
manifold as a union of three $4$-dimensional handlebodies. The complexity of
the $4$-manifold is captured in a collection of curves on a surface, which
guide the gluing of the handelbodies. The algorithm begins with a description
of a manifold as a union of pentachora, or $4$-dimensional simplices. It
transforms this description into a trisection. This results in the first
explicit complexity bounds for the trisection genus of a $4$-manifold in terms
of the number of pentachora ($4$-simplices) in a triangulation.

introduce a new class of loop measures called Bosonic loop measures. Namely, we
consider loop soups with varying intensity $ \mu\le 0 $ (chemical potential in
physics terms), and secondly, we study Markovian loop measures on graphs with
an additional ""time"" dimension leading to so-called space-time random walks and
their loop measures and Poisson point loop processes. Interesting phenomena
appear when the additional coordinate of the space-time process is on a
discrete torus with non-symmetric jump rates. The projection of these
space-time random walk loop measures onto the space dimensions is loop measures
on the spatial graph, and in the scaling limit of the discrete torus, these
loop measures converge to the so-called [Bosonic loop measures]. This provides
a natural probabilistic definition of [Bosonic loop measures]. These novel loop
measures have similarities with the standard Markovian loop measures only that
they give weights to loops of certain lengths, namely any length which is
multiple of a given length $ \beta> 0 $ which serves as an additional
parameter. We complement our study with generalised versions of Dynkin's
isomorphism theorem (including a version for the whole complex field) as well
as Symanzik's moment formulae for complex Gaussian measures. Due to the lacking
symmetry of our space-time random walks, the distributions of the occupation
time fields are given in terms of complex Gaussian measures over complex-valued

networks, where node failures are common. They guarantee low cost data
reconstruction and repair through accessing only a predefined number of
arbitrarily chosen storage nodes in the network. In this work we consider two
simultaneous extensions to the original regenerating codes framework introduced
in [1]; i) both data reconstruction and repair are resilient to the presence of
a certain number of erroneous nodes in the network and ii) the number of helper
nodes in every repair is not fixed, but is a flexible parameter that can be
selected during the runtime. We study the fundamental limits of required total
repair bandwidth and provide an upper bound for the storage capacity of these
codes under these assumptions. We then focus on the minimum repair bandwidth
(MBR) case and derive the exact storage capacity by presenting explicit coding
schemes with exact repair, which achieve the upper bound of the storage
capacity in the considered setup. To this end, we first provide a more natural
extension of the well-known Product Matrix (PM) MBR codes [2], modified to
provide flexibility in the choice of number of helpers in each repair, and
simultaneously be robust to erroneous nodes in the network. This is achieved by
proving the non-singularity of family of matrices in large enough finite
fields. We next provide another extension of the PM codes, based on novel
repair schemes which enable flexibility in the number of helpers and robustness
against erroneous nodes without any extra cost in field size compared to the
original PM codes.

we develop generalization bounds between the learned distribution and true

Since guaranteeing fairness among mobile users (MUs) is not well investigated

schemes called proportional fairness (PF) and min-max fairness (MMF). The PF
scheme deals with minimizing the total weighted latency of MUs while MMF aims
at minimizing the maximum latency among them. In the CP, we propose a novel

jointly perform the allocation of physical resources as storage and radio, and
user association to improve the flexibility of the CPSs. Moreover, In the DP of
each fairness scheme, an efficient delivery policy is proposed based on the
arrival requests of MUs, CSI, and caching status. Numerical assessments
demonstrate that our proposed CPSs outperform the total latency of MUs up to

sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso
regularization to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques,
we demonstrate that we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from
80% to 90% with small loss in accuracy. This allows us to reduce the model size
by roughly 10x. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover
this loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the
overall parameter count. Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up
to 32x32. Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and
irregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to
unstructured sparsity.

policies, economical models, and topologies. This versatility translates into a
substantially complex system that is hard to comprehend. Monitoring the
inter-domain routing infrastructure is however essential for understanding the
current state of the Internet and improving it. In this paper we design a
methodology to answer two simple questions: Which are the common transit
networks used to reach a certain AS? How much does this AS depends on these
transit networks? To answer these questions we digest AS paths advertised with
the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) into AS graphs and measure node centrality,
that is the likelihood of an AS to lie on paths between two other ASes. Our
proposal relies solely on the AS hegemony metric, a new way to quantify node
centrality while taking into account the bias towards the partial view offered
by BGP. Our analysis using 14 years of BGP data refines our knowledge on
Internet flattening but also exhibits the consolidated position of tier-1

away from classical no-arbitrage valuation towards valuation under the real
world probability measure. Furthermore, we apply this valuation method to two
examples of annuity products, one having annual payments linked to a mortality
index and the savings account and the other having annual payments linked to a
mortality index and an equity index with a guarantee that is linked to the same
mortality index and the savings account. Out-of-sample hedge simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of real world valuation.
  In contrast to risk neutral valuation, which is a form of relative valuation,
the long term average excess return of the equity market comes into play.
Instead of the savings account, the num\'eraire portfolio is employed as the
fundamental unit of value in the analysis. The num\'eraire portfolio is the
strictly positive, tradable portfolio that when used as benchmark makes all
benchmarked nonnegative portfolios supermartingales. The benchmarked real world
value of a benchmarked contingent claim equals its real world conditional
expectation. This yields the minimal possible value for its hedgeable part and
minimizes the fluctuations for its benchmarked hedge error. Under classical
assumptions, actuarial and risk neutral valuation emerge as special cases of
the proposed real world valuation. In long term liability and asset valuation,
the proposed real world valuation can lead to significantly lower values than
suggested by classical approaches when an equivalent risk neutral probability
measure does not exist.

The quasi-Bragg scattering corresponds to finite extent ferromagnetic domains

moving camera. As a result, the structural constraints are able to cut down the
match ambiguities caused by the moving cameras as well as similar appearances
of the tracked objects. The proposed heuristic method aims to obtain a maximum
match set under the minimum structural cost for each available match pair,
which can be integrated with the raw association costs and make them more
elaborate and discriminative compared with other approaches. In addition, this

telecommunication networks and attracts intense research interests. A
significant number of algorithms and models have been put forward to analyse
traffic data and make prediction. In the recent big data era, deep learning has
been exploited to mine the profound information hidden in the data. In
particular, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), one kind of Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) schemes, has attracted a lot of attentions due to its capability of
processing the long-range dependency embedded in the sequential traffic data.
However, LSTM has considerable computational cost, which can not be tolerated
in tasks with stringent latency requirement. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model based on LSTM, called Random Connectivity LSTM (RCLSTM).
Compared to the conventional LSTM, RCLSTM makes a notable breakthrough in the
formation of neural network, which is that the neurons are connected in a
stochastic manner rather than full connected. So, the RCLSTM, with certain
intrinsic sparsity, have many neural connections absent (distinguished from the
full connectivity) and which leads to the reduction of the parameters to be
trained and the computational cost. We apply the RCLSTM to predict traffic and
validate that the RCLSTM with even 35% neural connectivity still shows a
satisfactory performance. When we gradually add training samples, the
performance of RCLSTM becomes increasingly closer to the baseline LSTM.
Moreover, for the input traffic sequences of enough length, the RCLSTM exhibits
even superior prediction accuracy than the baseline LSTM.

distribution associated to partially observed stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), which are observed discretely in time. Such models appear in a wide
variety of applications including econometrics, finance and engineering. This
problem is notoriously challenging, as the smoother is not available
analytically and hence require numerical approximation. This usually consists
by applying a time-discretization to the SDE, for instance the Euler method,
and then applying a numerical (e.g. Monte Carlo) method to approximate the
smoother. This has lead to a vast literature on methodology for solving such
problems, perhaps the most popular of which is based upon the particle filter
(PF) e.g. [9]. In the context of filtering for this class of problems, it is
well-known that the particle filter can be improved upon in terms of cost to
achieve a given mean squared error (MSE) for estimates. This in the sense that
the computational effort can be reduced to achieve this target MSE, by using
multilevel (ML) methods [12, 13, 18], via the multilevel particle filter (MLPF)
[16, 20, 21]. For instance, to obtain a MSE of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ for
some $\epsilon > 0$ when approximating filtering distributions associated with
Euler-discretized diffusions with constant diffusion coefficients, the cost of
the PF is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ while the cost of the MLPF is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\log(\epsilon)^2)$. In this article we consider a new
approach to replace the particle filter, using transport methods in [27]. In
the context of filtering, one expects that the proposed method improves upon
the MLPF by yielding, under assumptions, a MSE of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ for
a cost of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. This is established theoretically in an

Le","Intriguing Properties of Adversarial Examples","17 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are
vulnerable to adversarial examples. In attempting to explain the origin of
adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that
neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too
linear. Here we argue that the origin of adversarial examples is primarily due
to an inherent uncertainty that neural networks have about their predictions.
We show that the functional form of this uncertainty is independent of
architecture, dataset, and training protocol; and depends only on the
statistics of the logit differences of the network, which do not change
significantly during training. This leads to adversarial error having a
universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial
perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of
datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including
state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks,
and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step
l.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing
prediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of
network architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural
architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust
architectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white
\emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.

general, the tensile strength for both of the pristine and SW defective MBP
decreases with the increase of temperature or decreasing of strain rate.
Surprisingly, for relatively high temperature and low strain rate, phase
transition from the black phosphorene to a mixture of {\beta}-phase ({\beta}-P)

armchair tension, while self-healing of the SW-2 defect is observed under

The standard approach when extracting the charge distribution of a given system
is to treat the constituent charges as points. This can, however, lead to an
overestimation of multipole moments of high order, such as dipole, quadrupole,
and higher moments. Focusing on distributions of charges located on a spherical
surface -- characteristic of numerous biological macromolecules, such as
globular proteins and viral capsids, as well as of inverse patchy colloids --
we develop a novel way of representing spherical surface charge distributions
based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution. This approach takes into account
the finite spatial extension of individual charges, and leads to a simple yet
powerful way of describing surface charge distributions and their multipole
expansions. In this manner, we analyze charge distributions and the derived
multipole moments of a number of different spherical configurations of
identical charges with various degrees of symmetry. We show how the number of
charges, their size, and the geometry of their configuration influence the
behavior and relative importance of multipole magnitudes of different order.
Importantly, we clearly demonstrate how neglecting the effect of charge size
leads to an overestimation of high-order multipoles. The results of our work
can be applied to construct analytical models of electrostatic interactions and
multipole expansion of charged particles in diverse soft matter and biological
systems.

without training data, which is an important and challenging problem. Most
existing ZSH approaches exploit transfer learning via an intermediate shared
semantic representations between the seen/source classes and novel/target
classes. However, due to having disjoint, the hash functions learned from the
source dataset are biased when applied directly to the target classes. In this
paper, we study the transductive ZSH, i.e., we have unlabeled data for novel
classes. We put forward a simple yet efficient joint learning approach via
coarse-to-fine similarity mining which transfers knowledges from source data to
target data. It mainly consists of two building blocks in the proposed deep
architecture: 1) a shared two-streams network, which the first stream operates
on the source data and the second stream operates on the unlabeled data, to
learn the effective common image representations, and 2) a coarse-to-fine
module, which begins with finding the most representative images from target
classes and then further detect similarities among these images, to transfer
the similarities of the source data to the target data in a greedy fashion.
Extensive evaluation results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed hashing method achieves significant improvement over the

quantum kinetic equations, the Hamiltonian time evolution as well as the
Closed-Time-Path technique are presented, and we discuss their relations. For
scenarios with two right-handed neutrinos, we chart the viable parameter space.
Both, a Bayesian analysis, that determines the most likely configurations for
viable leptogenesis given different variants of flat priors, and a
determination of the maximally allowed mixing between the light, mostly
left-handed, and heavy, mostly right-handed, neutrino states are discussed.
Rephasing invariants are shown to be a useful tool to classify and to
understand various distinct contributions to ARS leptogenesis that can dominate
in different parametric regimes. While these analyses are carried out for the
parametric regime where initial asymmetries are generated predominantly from
lepton-number conserving, but flavor violating effects, we also review the

scale of the right-handed neutrinos to be above 10^9 GeV. This lower bound can
be avoided if at least two of the sterile states are almost mass degenerate,
which leads to an enhancement of the decay asymmetry. Leptogenesis models that
can be tested in current and upcoming experiments often rely on this resonant
enhancement, and a systematic and consistent description is therefore necessary
for phenomenological applications. In this review article, we give an overview
of different methods that have been used to study the saturation of the
resonant enhancement when the mass difference becomes comparable to the
characteristic width of the Majorana neutrinos. In this limit, coherent flavor
transitions start to play a decisive role, and off-diagonal correlations in
flavor space have to be taken into account. We compare various formalisms that
have been used to describe the resonant regime and discuss under which
circumstances the resonant enhancement can be captured by simplified
expressions for the CP asymmetry. Finally, we briefly review some of the
phenomenological aspects of resonant leptogenesis.

Ratios of strange particles to mesons show clear and pronounced maxima around
this beam energy. The theoretical interpretation can be clarified by covering

these pixels. Many fully automated methods have been proposed in recent years,

wind suprathermal electron distributions for the presence of signatures of the
coronal temperature at their origin which may remain at 1AU. In particular we
re-examine a previous suggestion that these properties correlate with the
oxygen charge state ratio O7+/O6+; an established proxy for coronal electron
temperature. We find only a very weak but variable correlation between measures
of suprathermal electron energy content and O7+/O6+. The weak nature of the
correlation leads us to conclude, in contrast to earlier results, that an
initial relationship with core electron temperature has the possibility to
exist in the corona, but that in most cases no strong signatures remain in the
suprathermal electron distributions at 1AU. It can not yet be confirmed whether
this is due to the effects of coronal conditions on the establishment of this
relationship, or to the altering of the electron distributions by processing
during transport in the solar wind en route to 1AU. Contrasting results for the
halo and strahl population favours the latter interpretation. Confirmation of
this will be possible using Solar Orbiter data (cruise and nominal mission
phase) to test whether the weakness of the relationship persists over a range
of heliocentric distances. If the correlation is found to strengthen when
closer to the Sun, then this would indicate an initial relationship which is
being degraded, perhaps by wave-particle interactions, en route to the observer

and local attachment rules have received much attention over the last decade.
Among various approaches, random walks have been leveraged to capture such
principles. In this paper we consider the No Restart Random Walk (NRRW) model
where a walker builds its graph (tree) while moving around. In particular, the
walker takes s steps (a parameter) on the current graph. A new node with degree
one is added to the graph and connected to the node currently occupied by the
walker. The walker then resumes, taking another s steps, and the process
repeats. We analyze this process from the perspective of the walker and the
network, showing a fundamental dichotomy between transience and recurrence for
the walker as well as power law and exponential degree distribution for the
network. More precisely, we prove the following results: i) for s=1 the random
walk is transient and the degree of every node is bounded from above by a
geometric distribution. ii) for s even the random walk is recurrent and the
degree of non-leaf nodes is bounded from below by a power law distribution with
exponent decreasing in s. We also provide a lower bound for the fraction of
leaves in the graph, and for s=2 our bound implies that the fraction of leaves
goes to one as the graph size goes to infinity. NRRW exhibits an interesting
mutual dependency between graph building and random walking that is
fundamentally influenced by the parity of s. Understanding this kind of coupled
dynamics is an important step towards modeling more realistic network growth
processes.

from potential flow, is shown to produce good approximations at all wavelengths
for a wide range of naturally occuring shear flows as well as widely used model
flows. The relation reduces in many cases to a 3D generalization of the much
used approximation by Skop [1987], developed further by Kirby & Chen [1989],
but is shown to be more robust, succeeding in situations where the Kirby & Chen
model fails. The two approximations incur the same numerical cost and
difficulty.
  While the Kirby & Chen approximation is excellent for a wide range of
currents, the exact criteria for its applicability have not been known. We
explain the apparently serendipitous success of the latter and derive proper
conditions of applicability for both approximate dispersion relations. Our new
model has a greater range of applicability.
  A second order approximation is also derived. It greatly improves accuracy,
which is shown to be important in difficult cases. It has an advantage over the
corresponding 2nd order expression proposed by Kirby \& Chen that its criterion
of accuracy is explicitly known, which is not currently the case for the latter
to our knowledge. Our 2nd order term is also arguably significantly simpler to
implement, and more physically transparent, than its sibling due to Kirby &
Chen.

to understanding the iron-based superconductivity mechanism. Herein we report a

scattering rates deviating from the Fermi liquid. We find that the
superconductivity occurs upon the electron and hole mobility becoming

justification. In this work we remedy this situation by including a simple
vertex correction that is consistent with an LDA starting point. We analyse the
effect of the self-energy by splitting it into a short-range and long-range
term which are shown to govern respectively the center and size of the band
gap. The vertex mainly improves the short-range correlations and therefore has
a small effect on the band gap, while it shifts the band gap center up in
energy by around 0.5 eV in good agreement with experiments. Our analysis also
explains how the relative importance of short- and long-range interactions in
structures of different dimensionality is reflected in their QP energies.
Inclusion of the vertex comes at practically no extra computational cost and
even improves the basis set convergence compared to GW. The method thus
provides an efficient and rigorous improvement over the GW approximation and
sets a new standard for quasiparticle calculations of solids.

on a systematic census of the compact radio sources toward NGC 6334, and their
characteristics. This will be used to try and define their very nature. We use
VLA C band (4-8 GHz) archive data with 0.36"" of spatial resolution and noise
level of 50 uJy/bm to carry out a systematic search for compact radio sources
within NGC 6334. We also search for infrared counterparts to provide some
constraints on the nature of the detected radio sources. A total of 83 compact
sources and three slightly resolved sources were detected. Most of them are
here reported for the first time. We found that 29 of these 86 sources have
infrared counterparts and three are highly variable. Region D contains 18 of
these sources. The compact source toward the center, in projection, of region E
is also detected. From statistical analyses, we suggest that the 83 reported
compact sources are real and most of them are related to NGC 6334 itself. A
stellar nature for 27 of them is confirmed by their IR emission. Compared with
Orion, region D suffers a deficit of compact radio sources. The infrared
nebulosities around two of the slightly resolved sources are suggested to be
warm dust, and we argue that the associated radio sources trace free-free
emission from ionized material. We confirm the thermal radio emission of the
compact source in region E. However, its detection at infrared wavelengths
implies that it is located in the foreground of the molecular cloud. Three
strongly variable sources are suggested to be magnetically active young stars.

accompanied by detectable circumstellar dust/gas discs or (in the case of WD
1145+017) transiting disintegrating asteroids. Delivery of planetesimals to the
white dwarf by orbiting planets is a leading candidate to explain these
phenomena. Here, we study systems of planets and planetesimals undergoing
planet-planet scattering triggered by the star's post-main sequence mass loss,
and test whether this can maintain high rates of delivery over the several Gyr
that they are observed. We find that low-mass planets (Earth to Neptune mass)
are efficient deliverers of material and can maintain the delivery for Gyr.
Unstable low-mass planetary systems reproduce the observed delayed onset of
significant accretion, as well as the slow decay in accretion rates at late
times. Higher-mass planets are less efficient, and the delivery only lasts a
relatively brief time before the planetesimal populations are cleared. The
orbital inclinations of bodies as they cross the white dwarf's Roche limit are
roughly isotropic, implying that significant collisional interactions of
asteroids, debris streams and discs can be expected. If planet-planet
scattering is indeed responsible for the pollution of white dwarfs, many such
objects, and their main-sequence progenitors, can be expected to host
(currently undetectable) super-Earth planets on orbits of several au and
beyond.

versatile metamaterials and photonic components including optical sources and

optical properties with applied bias via altering their free carrier
concentration and hence plasma dispersion. The TCO material indium tin oxide
(ITO) exhibits unity-strong index changes, and epsilon-near-zero behavior.
However, with such tuning the corresponding high optical losses, originating
from the fundamental Kramers-Kronig relations, result in low cavity finesse.
However, achieving efficient tuning in ITO-cavities without using light matter
interaction enhancement techniques such as polaritonic modes, which are
inherently lossy, is a challenge. Here we discuss a novel one-dimensional
photonic crystal nanobeam cavity to deliver a cavity system offering a wide
range of resonance tuning range, while preserving physical compact footprints.
We show that a vertical Silicon-slot waveguide incorporating an actively
gated-ITO layer delivers ~3.4 nm of tuning. By deploying distributed feedback,
we are able to keep the Q-factor moderately high with tuning. Combining this
with the sub-diffraction limited mode volume (0.1 ({\lambda}/2n)3) from the
photonic (non-plasmonic) slot waveguide, facilitates a high Purcell factor
exceeding one thousand. This strong light-matter-interaction shows that
reducing the mode volume of a cavity outweighs reducing the losses in
diffraction limited modal cavities such as those from bulk Si3N4. These tunable
cavities enable future modulators and optical sources such as tunable lasers.

described by absorbed power laws. However, in some cases, additional thermal
components have been identified. The origin of this emission is debated, with
proposed explanations including supernova shock breakout, emission from a
cocoon surrounding the jet, as well as emission from the jet itself. A larger
sample of detections is needed in order to place constraints on these different
models. Here we present a time-resolved spectral analysis of 74 GRBs observed
by Swift XRT in a search for thermal components. We report six detections in
our sample, and also confirm an additional three cases that were previously
reported in the literature. The majority of these bursts have a narrow range of
blackbody radii around ~ 2 x 10^{12} cm, despite having a large range of
luminosities (L ~ 10^{47} - 10^{51} erg s^{-1}). This points to an origin
connected to the progenitor stars, and we suggest that emission from a cocoon
breaking out from a thick wind may explain the observations. For two of the
bursts in the sample, an explanation in terms of late prompt emission from the
jet is instead more likely. We also find that these thermal components are
preferentially detected when the X-ray luminosity is low, which suggests that
they may be hidden by bright afterglows in the majority of GRBs.

poly($p$-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) are theoretically investigated within a
coarse-grained model, in which both the exciton and nuclear degrees of freedom
are treated quantum mechanically. The Frenkel-Holstein Hamiltonian is used to
describe the strong exciton-phonon coupling present in the system, while
external damping of the internal nuclear degrees of freedom are accounted for
by a Lindblad master equation. Numerically, the dynamics are computed using the
time evolving block decimation (TEBD) and quantum jump trajectory techniques.
The values of the model parameters physically relevant to polymer systems
naturally lead to a separation of time scales, with the ultra-fast dynamics
corresponding to energy transfer from the exciton to the internal phonon modes
(i.e., the C-C bond oscillations), while the longer time dynamics correspond to
damping of these phonon modes by the external dissipation. Associated with
these time scales, we investigate the following processes that are indicative
of the system relaxing onto the emissive chromophores of the polymer: 1)
Exciton-polaron formation occurs on an ultra-fast time scale, with the
associated exciton-phonon correlations present within half a vibrational time
period of the C-C bond oscillations. 2) Exciton decoherence is driven by the
decay in the vibrational overlaps associated with exciton-polaron formation,
occurring on the same time scale. 3) Exciton density localization is driven by
the external dissipation, arising from `wavefunction collapse' occurring as a
result of the system-environment interactions. Finally, we show how
fluorescence anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate the exciton
decoherence process during the relaxation dynamics.

initially prepared in a thermal state, then at a given time the bath is
disconnected and the interaction strength is suddenly quenched. The
corresponding effects on the long times dynamics of the non-equilibrium

thermal effects and are washed out at long times, while the universal behaviour
$\propto t^{-2}$ is always present. To verify our findings, we argue that these
features are also visible in transport properties at finite temperature. The
long-time dynamics of the current injected from a biased probe exhibits the
same universal power law relaxation, in sharp contrast with the non-quenched
case which features a fast exponential decay of the current towards its steady

technologies and multi-user MIMO seems a very promising strategy. As hardware
limitations impede to realize a full digital architecture, hybrid MIMO
architectures, using digital precoding and phased antenna arrays, are
considered a feasible solution to implement multi-user MIMO at millimeter wave.
However, real channel propagation and hardware non-idealities can significantly
degrade the performance of such systems. Experimenting the new architecture is
thus crucial to confirm and to support system design. Nevertheless, hybrid MIMO
systems are not yet understood as the effects of the wide channel bandwidths at
millimeter wave, the non-ideal RF front end as well as the imperfections of the
analog beamforming are often neglected. In this paper, we present a 60 GHz
MU-MIMO testbed using phased antenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver.
The base station equipped with a 32 phased antenna array allocates
simultaneously two users. We show that frequency selective hybrid precoding can
efficiently suppress inter-user interference enabling spatial multiplexing in
interference limited scenario doubling the throughput compared to a SISO
scenario and compensating the frequency fluctuation of the channel. In
addition, we report an EVM constellation improvement of 6 dB when comparing the

why they are not squeezed. However, away from the critical model squeezing does

To address this combinatorial non-convex problem maintaining a strict control

minimization of the Frobenius norm criterion. We provide a new efficient
algorithm named K-sparse which alternates k-means with projection-gradient
minimization. The projection-gradient step is a method of splitting type, with
exact projection on the $\ell^1$ ball to promote sparsity. The convergence of
the gradient-projection step is addressed, and a preliminary analysis of the

number of iterates in Algorithm K-sparse goes to infinity. Experiments on
Single Cell RNA sequencing datasets show that our method significantly improves
the results of PCA k-means, spectral clustering, SIMLR, and Sparcl methods, and
achieves a relevant selection of genes. The complexity of K-sparse is linear in
the number of samples (cells), so that the method scales up to large datasets.

allows cross-national comparison. Analyzing a large amount of speech records of
legislative debate in the United States Congress and the Japanese Diet over a
long period of time, we have reached two intriguing findings. First, on
average, Japanese political actors are far more polarized in their issue
articulation than their counterparts in the U.S., which is somewhat surprising
given the recent notion of U.S. politics as highly polarized. Second, the
polarization in each country shows its own temporal dynamics in response to a
different set of factors. In Japan, structural factors such as the roles of the
ruling party and the opposition often dominate such dynamics, whereas the U.S.
legislature suffers from persistent ideological differences over particular
issues between major political parties. The analysis confirms a strong
influence of institutional differences on legislative debate in parliamentary

different initial Bloch states are decoupled in the velocity gauge. Although
there is no quantum mechanical interference between the time evolution of
different initial states, the complete harmonic radiation results from the
interference of fields emitted by all the initial (valence band) states. In
particular, this interference is shown to be responsible for the suppression of
the even order harmonics. The number of the observable harmonics (essentially
the cutoff) is also determined by electromagnetic field interference.

are not feasible yet for most practical turbulent flows. Therefore, dynamically
less complex mathematical formulations are necessary for coarse-grained
simulations. In this regard, eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy Simulation
(LES) are probably the most popular example thereof. This type of models
requires the calculation of a subgrid characteristic length which is usually
associated with the local grid size. For isotropic grids this is equal to the
mesh step. However, for anisotropic or unstructured grids, such as the
pancake-like meshes that are often used to resolve near-wall turbulence or
shear layers, a consensus on defining the subgrid characteristic length has not
been reached yet despite the fact that it can strongly affect the performance
of LES models. In this context, a new definition of the subgrid characteristic
length is presented in this work. This flow-dependent length scale is based on
the turbulent, or subgrid stress, tensor and its representations on different
grids. The simplicity and mathematical properties suggest that it can be a
robust definition that minimizes the effects of mesh anisotropies on simulation
results. The performance of the proposed subgrid characteristic length is
successfully tested for decaying isotropic turbulence and a turbulent channel
flow using artificially refined grids. Finally, a simple extension of the
method for unstructured meshes is proposed and tested for a turbulent flow
around a square cylinder. Comparisons with existing subgrid characteristic
length scales show that the proposed definition is much more robust with
respect to mesh anisotropies and has a great potential to be used in complex
geometries where highly skewed (unstructured) meshes are present.

nutrient taxis system with doubly degenerate cross-diffusion proposed by Leyva
et al. (2013) to model the complex spatio-temporal dynamics exhibited by the
bacterium B. subtilis during experiments run in vitro. This justification is
based on a microscopic description of the movement of individual cells whose
changes in velocity (in both speed and orientation) obey a velocity jump
process (Othmer, Dunbar, Alt, 1988), governed by a transport equation of
Boltzmann type. For that purpose, the asymptotic method introduced by Hillen
and Othmer (2000, 2002) is applied, which consists of the computation of the
leading order term in a regular Hilbert expansion for the solution to the
transport equation, under an appropriate parabolic scaling and a first order
perturbation of the turning rate of Schnitzer type (Schnitzer, 1993). The
resulting parabolic limit equation at leading order for the bacterial cell
density recovers the degenerate nonlinear cross diffusion term and the
associated chemotactic drift appearing in the original system of equations.
Although the bacterium B. subtilis is used as a prototype, the method and
results apply in more generality.

Monitoring, refining, and understanding these period variations allows us to

instability strip in which they reside, and to test models of stellar
evolution. VZ Cyg, a classical Cepheid pulsating at $\sim$4.864 days, has been
observed for over 100 years. Combining data from literature observations, the
Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) transit survey, and new targeted
observations with the Robotically Controlled Telescope (RCT) at Kitt Peak, we
find a period change rate of $dP/dt = -0.0642 \pm 0.0018$ sec yr$^{-1}$.
However, when only the recent observations are examined, we find a much higher
period change rate of $dP/dt = - 0.0923 \pm 0.0110$ sec yr$^{-1}$. This higher
rate could be due to an apparent long-term (P $\approx$ 26.5 yr) cyclic period
variation. The possible interpretations of this single Cepheid's complex period
variations underscore both the need to regularly monitor pulsating variables,
and the important benefits that photometric surveys such as KELT can have on
the field. Further monitoring of this interesting example of Cepheid
variability is recommended to confirm and better understand the possible cyclic
period variations. Further, Cepheid timing analyses are necessary to fully
understand their current behaviors and parameters, as well as their
evolutionary histories.

an anisotropic inhomogeneous spin model in the presence of a magnetic field, we

emission now known to be a generic property of high-redshift star-forming
galaxies. We simulated realistic extended LAEs to characterise the selection
function of our samples, and performed flux-recovery experiments to test and
correct for bias in our determination of total Lya fluxes. We find an accurate
completeness correction accounting for extended emission reveals a very steep
faint-end slope of the LF, alpha, down to luminosities of log10 L erg s^-1<
41.5, applying both the 1/Vmax and maximum likelihood estimators. Splitting the
sample into three broad redshift bins, we see the faint-end slope increasing
from -2.03+1.42-inf at z ~ 3.44 to -2.86+0.76-inf at z ~ 5.48, however no
strong evolution is seen between the 68% confidence regions in L*-alpha
parameter space. Using the Lya line flux as a proxy for star formation
activity, and integrating the observed LFs, we find that LAEs' contribution to
the cosmic SFRD rises with redshift until it is comparable to that from
continuum-selected samples by z ~ 6. This implies that LAEs may contribute more
to the star-formation activity of the early Universe than previously thought -
any additional interglactic medium correction would act to further boost the
Lya luminosities. Finally, assuming fiducial values for the escape of Lya and
LyC radiation, and the clumpiness of the IGM, we integrated the maximum
likelihood LF at 5.00 < z < 6.64 and find we require only a small extrapolation
beyond the data (< 1 dex in L) for LAEs alone to maintain an ionised IGM at z ~
6.

flares and dips, origin of which is not well understood. We present results
from our optical and NIR observing campaign of PSR J1023+0038, a transitional
millisecond pulsar observed in an accretion state. Our wide band optical
photopolarimetry indicates that the system shows intrinsic linear polarisation,
the degree of which is anticorrelated with optical emission, i.e. the
polarisation could be diluted during the flares. However, the change in
position angle during the flares suggests an additional emerging polarised
component during the flares. We also find, based on our H$_\alpha$ spectroscopy
and Doppler tomography, that there is indication for change in the accretion
disc structure/emission during the flares, possibly due to a change in
accretion flow. This, together with changing polarisation during the flares,
could mark the existence of magnetic propeller mass ejection process in the
system. Furthermore, our analysis of flare profiles in both optical and NIR
shows that NIR flares are at least as powerful as the optical ones and both can
exhibit transition time scales less than 3 sec. The optical/NIR flares
therefore seem to originate from a separate, polarised transient component,
which might be due to Thomson scattering from propeller ejected matter.

consider four distributions of a random variable: Log-Normal, Weibull, Gamma
and Beta. In order to evaluate the parameters of distributions we use method of
maximum likelihood. To assess the the results of approximation we use a
quantile-quantile plot. Results. All the considered distributions properly
approximate the available data. The Weibull distribution shows the best results

analysis are consistent with the common practice of using the Weibull

transport. The upper layer is filled by water and the lower one by sediment.
The key point falls on the definition of the friction laws between the two
layers, which are a generalization of those introduced in Fern\'andez-Nieto et
al. (ESAIM: M2AN, 51:115-145, 2017). This definition allows to apply properly
the two-layer shallow water model for the case of intense and slow bedload
sediment transport. Moreover, we prove that the two-layer model converges to a
Saint-Venant-Exner system (SVE) including gravitational effects when the ratio
between the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic time scales is small. The SVE with
gravitational effects is a degenerated nonlinear parabolic system. This means
that its numerical approximation is very expensive from a computational point
of view, see for example T. Morales de Luna et al. (J. Sci. Comp., 48(1):
258-273, 2011). In this work, gravitational effects are introduced into the
two-layer system without such extra computational cost. Finally, we also
consider a generalization of the model that includes a non-hydrostatic pressure
correction for the fluid layer and the boundary condition at the sediment
surface. Numerical tests show that the model provides promising results and
behave well in low transport rate regimes as well as in many other situations.

the power of the momentum in the integrand can be increased by $2$ in the
infrared using large gauge transformations, which are sufficient for rendering
these two-point functions infrared finite for slow-roll inflation. In other
words, if the integrand of the momentum integral for these two-point functions
behaves like $p^{-2\nu}$, where $p$ is the momentum, in the infrared, then it
can be made to behave like $p^{-2\nu+2}$ by large gauge transformations. On the
other hand, it is known that, if one smears these two-point functions in a
gauge-invariant manner, the power of the momentum in the integrand is changed
from $p^{-2\nu}$ to $p^{-2\nu+4}$. This fact suggests that the power of the
momentum in the integrand for these two-point functions can be increased by $4$
using large gauge transformations. In this paper we show that this is indeed
the case. Thus, the two-point functions for the graviton and inflaton fields

equation (KGE), in the hydrodynamic representation, can be represented by the
motion of a mass density subject to the Bohm-type quantum potential, whose
equation can be derived by a minimum action principle. Once the quantum
hydrodynamic motion equations have been covariantly extended to the curved
space-time, the gravity equation (GE), determining the geometry of the
space-time, is obtained by minimizing the overall action comprehending the
gravitational field. The derived Einstein-like gravity for the KGE field shows
an energy-impulse tensor density (EITD) that is a function of the field with
the spontaneous emergence of the cosmological pressure tensor density (CPTD)
that in the classical limit leads to the cosmological constant(CC). The
energy-impulse tensor of the theory shows analogies with the modified
Brans-Dick gravity with an effective gravity constant G divided by the field
squared. Even if the classical cosmological constant is set to zero, the model
shows the emergence of a theory-derived quantum CPTD that, in principle, allows
to have a stable quantum vacuum (out of the collapsed branched polymer phase)
without postulating a non-zero classical CC. In the classical macroscopic
limit, the gravity equation of the KGE field leads to the Einstein equation.
Moreover, if the boson field of the photon is considered, the EITD correctly
leads to its electromagnetic energy-impulse tensor density. The outputs of the
theory show that the expectation value of the CPTD is independent by the
zero-point vacuum energy density and that it tends to zero as the space-time
approaches to the flat vacuum, leading to an overall cosmological effect on the
motion of the galaxies that may possibly be compatible with the astronomical
observations.

constant is set to zero, the CGT is non zero, allowing to have a stable quantum

for a singularly perturbed linear inhomogeneous differential equation of an
arbitrary order. This sequence is also an asymptotic sequence in the following
sense: the deviation (in the norm of the space of continuous functions) of its
$n$th element from the solution of the problem is proportional to the $(n+1)$th
power of the parameter of perturbation. This sequence can be used for
justification of asymptotics obtained by the method of boundary functions.

common medical problems and a paucity of data from rare conditions. We propose
simulation of pathology in images to overcome the above limitations. Using
chest X-rays as a model medical image, we implement a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to create artificial images based upon a modest sized labeled
dataset. We employ a combination of real and artificial images to train a deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect pathology across five classes of
chest X-rays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the original
imbalanced dataset with GAN generated images improves performance of chest
pathology classification using the proposed DCNN in comparison to the same DCNN
trained with the original dataset alone. This improved performance is largely
attributed to balancing of the dataset using GAN generated images, where image
classes that are lacking in example images are preferentially augmented.

  Indoor Localization","6 pages, 5 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The localization technology is important for the development of indoor
location-based services (LBS). The radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based
localization is one of the most promising approaches. However, it is
challenging to apply this localization to real-world environments since it is
time-consuming and labor-intensive to construct a fingerprint database as a
prior for localization. Another challenge is that the presence of anomaly
readings in the fingerprints reduces the localization accuracy. To address
these two challenges, we propose an efficient and robust indoor localization
approach. First, we model the fingerprint database as a 3-D tensor, which
represents the relationships between fingerprints, locations and indices of
access points. Second, we introduce a tensor decomposition model for robust
fingerprint data recovery, which decomposes a partial observation tensor as the
superposition of a low-rank tensor and a spare anomaly tensor. Third, we
exploit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the
convex optimization problem of tensor-nuclear-norm completion for the anomaly
case. Finally, we verify the proposed approach on a ground truth data set
collected in an office building with size 80m times 20m. Experiment results
show that to achieve a same error rate 4%, the sampling rate of our approach is
only 10%, while it is 60% for the state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, the
proposed approach leads to a more accurate localization (nearly 20%, 0.6m
improvement) over the compared approach.

  engine efficiency","IAPT - Physics Education (Jul-Sep 2017)",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been many studies on gases which obeys Van der Waal's equation of
state. However there is no specific and direct studies of Van der Waal's gas
which undergoes adiabatic processes are available in the undergraduate text
books and also in literature. In an adiabatic process there is no heat energy
exchange between the system and its surroundings. In this article, we find that
the Van der Waal's equation for the adiabatic process as
$\left(P+\frac{n^2a}{V^2}\right) \left(V-nb\right)^{\Gamma}=\mbox{constant}$,
where $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles of the
Van der Waal's gas, $a$ and $b$ are Van der Waal's constant and $\Gamma$ is a
factor which relates the specific heat at constant pressure and at constant
volume. We use this relation explicitly and obtained the efficiency of a Carnot
engine whose working substance obeys Van der Waal's equation of state. Our
simplest approach may provide clear idea to the undergraduate students that
$\Gamma$ is different from $\gamma$ of the ideal gas for an adiabatic process.
We also shown that the efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the
working substance.
