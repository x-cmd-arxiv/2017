dynamics in neural processes, providing inspiration for computing with
nanoelectronic devices. However, training neural networks composed of dynamical
nanodevices requires finely controlling and tuning their coupled oscillations.
In this work, we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic
nano-oscillators can solve this challenge. We successfully train a hardware
network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by
tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We
show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the high frequency
tunability of the oscillators and their mutual coupling. Our results
demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with
small hardware neural networks by endowing them with non-linear dynamical
features: here, oscillations and synchronization. This demonstration is a
milestone for spintronics-based neuromorphic computing.

design a system which can detect the health of the power grid and take
protective measures accordingly even before a serious anomaly takes place. To
achieve this objective, we have set out to create an artificially intelligent
system which can analyze the grid information at any given time and determine
the health of the grid through the usage of sophisticated formal models and
novel machine learning techniques like recurrent neural networks. Our system
simulates grid conditions including stimuli like faults, generator output

convection is the formation of large-scale coherent structures, driven by
Reynolds stresses resulting from the small-scale convective flows. In spherical
geometry, such structures consist of intense zonal flows that are invariant
along the rotation axis. In planar geometry, long-lived, depth-invariant
structures also form at large scales, but, in the absence of horizontal
anisotropy, they consist of vortices that grow to the domain size. In this
work, through the introduction of horizontal anisotropy into a numerical model
of planar rotating convection by the adoption of unequal horizontal box sizes
(i.e. $L_x \le L_y$, where the $xy$-plane is horizontal), we investigate
whether unidirectional flows and large-scale vortices can coexist. We find that
only a small degree of anisotropy is required to bring about a transition from
dynamics dominated by persistent large-scale vortices to dynamics dominated by
persistent unidirectional flows parallel to the shortest horizontal direction.
When the anisotropy is sufficiently large, the unidirectional flow consists of
multiple jets, generated on a timescale smaller than a global viscous
timescale, thus signifying that the upscale energy transfer does not
spontaneously feed the largest available mode in the system. That said, the
multiple jets merge on much longer timescales. Large-scale vortices of size
comparable with $L_x$ systematically form in the flanks of the jets and can be
persistent or intermittent. This indicates that large-scale vortices, either
coexisting with jets or not, are a robust dynamical feature of planar rotating
convection.

by sorption to shale, and the detection by acoustic methods of CO$_2$
infiltration into shale. Although significant concerns have been raised about
the potential for induced seismicity to damage caprock, relatively little is
known about the permeability of the damaged shale. We present a summary of
recent experimental work that shows profound differences in permeability of up
to three orders of magnitude between brittle and ductile fracture permeability.
In the ductile regime, it is possible that shale caprock could accommodate
deformation without a significant loss of CO$_2$ from the storage reservoir. In
cases where CO$_2$ does migrate through damaged shale caprock, CO$_2$ sorption
onto shale mineralogy may have a mitigating impact. Measured total storage
capacities range from 1 to 45 kg-CO$_2$/tonne-shale. Once CO$_2$ is in the
caprock, changes in the acoustic properties of CO$_2$-saturated shale that are
predicted by Gassmann fluid substitution calculations show a significant

sub-sample, analyzing their spectral indices along the jet, and their alignment
with respect to the large-scale molecular outflow. Spectral indices for fluxes
integrated toward the position of the protostar are consistent with free-free
thermal emission. The value of the spectral index along a radio jet decreases
with distance from the protostar. For six sources, emission is well aligned
with the outflow central axis, showing that we observe the ionized base of the
jet. This is not the case for two sources, where we note misalignment of the
emission with respect to the large-scale outflow. This might indicate that the
emission does not originate in the radio jet, but rather in an ionized outflow
cavity wall or disk surface. For five of the sources, the spectral indices
along the jet decrease well below the thermal free-free limit of -0.1 with
$>2\sigma$ significance. This is indicative of synchrotron emission, meaning
that high energy electrons are being produced in the outflows close to the

Contractile droplets rotate only for planar anchoring and extensile ones only
for normal anchoring. This is because such a combination leads to a pair of
stable elastic deformations which creates an active torque to power the
rotation. Interestingly, under these conditions there is a conflict between the
anchoring promoted thermodynamically and that favoured by activity. By tuning
activity and anchoring strength, we find a wealth of qualitatively different
droplet morphologies and spatiotemporal patterns, encompassing steady
rotations, oscillations, and more irregular trajectories. The spontaneous
rotations we observe are fundamentally different from previously reported

be injected from the envelope into the He-rich layers, yielding the formation
of 13C and then the activation of the 13C(a,n)16O reaction. Only recently,
attempts to solve this problem started to consider quantitatively
physically-based mixing mechanisms. Among them, MHD processes in the plasma
were suggested to yield mass transport through magnetic buoyancy. In this
framework, we compare results of nucleosynthesis models for Low Mass AGB Stars

abundance ratios of s-elements in presolar SiC grains, which were shown to
offer precise constraints on the 13C reservoir. We find that n-captures driven
by magnetically-induced mixing can indeed account for the SiC data quite well
and that this is due to the fact that our 13C distribution fulfils the above
constraints rather accurately. We suggest that similar tests should be now
performed using different physical models for mixing. Such comparisons would

mode decomposition (DMD) and their variants are regularly used to educe
physical mechanisms of nonlinear flow phenomena that cannot be easily
understood through direct inspection. In fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
systems, fluid motion is coupled to vibration and/or deformation of an immersed
structure. Despite this coupling, data analysis is often performed using only
fluid or structure variables, rather than incorporating both. This approach
does not provide information about the manner in which fluid and structure
modes are correlated. We present a framework for performing POD and DMD where
the fluid and structure are treated together. As part of this framework, we
introduce a physically meaningful norm for FSI systems. We first use this
combined fluid-structure formulation to identify correlated flow features and
structural motions in limit-cycle flag flapping. We then investigate the
transition from limit-cycle flapping to chaotic flapping, which can be
initiated by increasing the flag mass. Our modal decomposition reveals that at
the onset of chaos, the dominant flapping motion increases in amplitude and
leads to a bluff-body wake instability. This new bluff-body mode interacts
triadically with the dominant flapping motion to produce flapping at the
non-integer harmonic frequencies previously reported by Connell & Yue (2007).
While our formulation is presented for POD and DMD, there are natural
extensions to other data-analysis techniques.

dibenzopyrene cation (C24H14+) isomers, namely dibenzo(a,e)pyrene (AE+) and
dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (AL+). First, action spectroscopy under VUV photons was
performed using synchrotron radiation in the 8-20 eV range. We observed lower
dissociation thresholds for the non-planar molecule (AL+) than for the planar
one (AE+) for the main dissociation pathways: H and 2H/H2 loss. In order to
rationalize the experimental results, dissociation paths were investigated by
means of density functional theory calculations. In the case of H loss, which
is the dominant channel at the lowest energies, the observed difference between
the two isomers can be explained by the presence in AL+ of two C-H bonds with
considerably lower adiabatic dissociation energies. In both isomers the 2H/H2
loss channels are observed only at about 1 eV higher than H loss. We suggest
that this is due to the propensity of bay H atoms to easily form H2. In
addition, in the case of AL+, we cannot exclude a competition between 2H and H2
channels. In particular, the formation of a stable dissociation product with a
five-membered ring could account for the low energy sequential loss of 2
hydrogens. This work shows the potential role of non-compact PAHs containing
bay regions in the production of H2 in space.

speculative optimizations to achieve speeds close to statically compiled
languages. These optimizations are typically performed by a just-in-time
compiler that generates code under a set of assumptions about the state of the
program and its environment. In certain cases, a program may execute code
compiled under assumptions that are no longer valid. The implementation must
then deoptimize the program on-the-fly; this entails finding semantically
equivalent code that does not rely on invalid assumptions, translating program
state to that expected by the target code, and transferring control. This paper
looks at the interaction between optimization and deoptimization, and shows
that reasoning about speculation is surprisingly easy when assumptions are made
explicit in the program representation. This insight is demonstrated on a
compiler intermediate representation, named \sourir, modeled after the
high-level representation for a dynamic language. Traditional compiler
optimizations such constant folding, dead code elimination, and function
inlining are shown to be correct in the presence of assumptions. Furthermore,
the paper establishes the correctness of compiler transformations specific to
deoptimization: namely unrestricted deoptimization, predicate hoisting, and
assume composition.

group $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ that become crystalline on $G_{F}$

that the representation associated with a finite slope newform of level
divisible by $p^2$ is crystabelline. In this article we study the connection
between the slopes of two-dimensional crystabelline representations and the
reducibility of their modulo $p$ reductions. This question is inspired by a
theorem by Buzzard and Kilford which implies that the slopes on the boundary of
the $2$-adic eigencurve of tame level $1$ are integers (and in arithmetic
progression); an analogous theorem by Roe which says that the same is true for
the $3$-adic eigencurve; Coleman's halo conjecture and the ghost conjecture
which give predictions about the slopes on the $p$-adic eigencurve of general
tame level; and Hodge theoretic conjectures by Breuil, Buzzard, Emerton, and
Gee which indicate that there is a connection between all of these and the
slopes of locally reducible two-dimensional crystabelline representations. We
prove that the reductions of certain two-dimensional crystabelline
representations with slopes in $(0,\frac{p-1}{2})\backslash \mathbb{Z}$ are
usually irreducible, with the exception of a small region where the slopes are
half-integers and reducible representations do occur.

line. Here we present a solution to this discrepancy for the z=0 systems. The
OII K-beta line ^4S^0 --> (^3D)3p ^4P at 562.40 eV (==22.04 AA) is blended with
the OVI K-alpha line in X-ray spectra. We estimate the strength of this OII
line in two different ways and show that in most cases the OII line accounts
for the entire blended line. The small amount of OVI equivalent width present
in some cases has column density entirely consistent with the UV value. This
solution to the OVI discrepancy, however, does not apply to the high column
density systems like AGN outflows. We discuss other possible causes to explain
their UV/X-ray mismatch. The OVI and OII lines will be resolved by gratings

models applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks,
including identifying similarity patterns in neural data (Representational
Similarity Analysis and its empirical Bayes variant, RSA and BRSA; Intersubject
Functional Connectivity, ISFC), combining multi-subject datasets (Shared
Response Mapping; SRM), and mapping between brain and behavior (Joint
Modeling). Although these methods share some underpinnings, they have been
developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We
show how the matrix-variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these
methods into a single framework. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse
noise modeling assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary
theoretical contribution shows how some of these methods can be written as
instantiations of the same model, allowing us to generalize them to flexibly
modeling structured noise covariances. Our formalism permits novel model
variants and improved estimation strategies: in contrast to SRM, the number of
parameters for MN-SRM does not scale with the number of voxels or subjects; in
contrast to BRSA, the number of parameters for MN-RSA scales additively rather
than multiplicatively in the number of voxels. We empirically demonstrate
advantages of two new methods derived in the formalism: for MN-RSA, we show up
to 10x improvement in runtime, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more
conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest
improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction while relaxing an orthonormality
constraint of SRM. We also provide a software prototyping tool for MN models
that can flexibly reuse noise covariance assumptions and algorithms across
models.

attributed to the enhanced electric field near the tip of the spike particles

electric field at the tips of the particles induces a change in polarizability

dielectric properties of the composite. Furthermore, it was determined that an

  Relationships",,,,,"cs.GR cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an application of mosaic diagrams to the visualisation of set
relations. Venn and Euler diagrams are the best known visual representations of
sets and their relationships (intersections, containment or subsets, exclusion
or disjointness). In recent years, alternative forms of visualisation have been
proposed. Among them, linear diagrams have been shown to compare favourably to
Venn and Euler diagrams, in supporting non-interactive assessment of set
relationships. Recent studies that compared several variants of linear diagrams
have demonstrated that users perform best at tasks involving identification of
intersections, disjointness and subsets when using a horizontally drawn linear
diagram with thin lines representing sets, and employing vertical lines as
guide lines. The essential visual task the user needs to perform in order to
interpret this kind of diagram is vertical alignment of parallel lines and
detection of overlaps. Space-filling mosaic diagrams which support this same
visual task have been used in other applications, such as the visualization of
schedules of activities, where they have been shown to be superior to linear
Gantt charts. In this paper, we present an application of mosaic diagrams for
visualization of set relationships, and compare it to linear diagrams in terms
of accuracy, time-to-answer, and subjective ratings of perceived task
difficulty. The study participants exhibited similar performance on both
visualisations, suggesting that mosaic diagrams are a good alternative to Venn
and Euler diagrams, and that the choice between linear diagrams and mosaics may
be solely guided by visual design considerations.

  Representations","NIPS'17 DISCML",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Embedding methods such as word embedding have become pillars for many
applications containing discrete structures. Conventional embedding methods
directly associate each symbol with a continuous embedding vector, which is
equivalent to applying linear transformation based on ""one-hot"" encoding of the
discrete symbols. Despite its simplicity, such approach yields number of
parameters that grows linearly with the vocabulary size and can lead to
overfitting. In this work we propose a much more compact K-way D-dimensional
discrete encoding scheme to replace the ""one-hot"" encoding. In ""KD encoding"",
each symbol is represented by a $D$-dimensional code, and each of its dimension
has a cardinality of $K$. The final symbol embedding vector can be generated by
composing the code embedding vectors. To learn the semantically meaningful
code, we derive a relaxed discrete optimization technique based on stochastic
gradient descent. By adopting the new coding system, the efficiency of
parameterization can be significantly improved (from linear to logarithmic),
and this can also mitigate the over-fitting problem. In our experiments with
language modeling, the number of embedding parameters can be reduced by 97\%
while achieving similar or better performance.

scalable algorithms that solve classical graph problems, such as maximum
matching and minimum vertex cover, on large datasets. For massive inputs,
several different computational models have been introduced, including the
streaming model, the distributed communication model, and the massively
parallel computation (MPC) model that is a common abstraction of
MapReduce-style computation. In each model, algorithms are analyzed in terms of
resources such as space used or rounds of communication needed, in addition to
the more traditional approximation ratio.
  In this paper, we give a single unified approach that yields better
approximation algorithms for matching and vertex cover in all these models. The
highlights include:
  * The first one pass, significantly-better-than-2-approximation for matching
in random arrival streams that uses subquadratic space, namely a
$(1.5+\epsilon)$-approximation streaming algorithm that uses $O(n^{1.5})$ space
for constant $\epsilon > 0$.
  * The first 2-round, better-than-2-approximation for matching in the MPC
model that uses subquadratic space per machine, namely a
$(1.5+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with $O(\sqrt{mn} + n)$ memory per
machine for constant $\epsilon > 0$.
  By building on our unified approach, we further develop parallel algorithms
in the MPC model that give a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation to matching and an
$O(1)$-approximation to vertex cover in only $O(\log\log{n})$ MPC rounds and
$O(n/poly\log{(n)})$ memory per machine. These results settle multiple open
questions posed in the recent paper of Czumaj~et.al. [STOC 2018].

superconductor with an imperfect surface incorporating either a thin layer with
a reduced pairing constant or a thin, proximity-coupled normal layer. Such
structures model realistic surfaces of superconducting materials which can
contain oxide layers, absorbed impurities or nonstoichiometric composition. We
solved the Usadel equations self-consistently and obtained spatial
distributions of the order parameter and the quasiparticle density of states
which then were used to calculate a low-frequency surface resistance $R_s(T)$
and the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ as functions of temperature in
the limit of local London electrodynamics. It is shown that the imperfect
surface in a single-band s-wave superconductor results in a non-exponential
temperature dependence of $Z(T)$ at $T\ll T_c$ which can mimic the behavior of
multiband or d-wave superconductors. The imperfect surface and the broadening
of the gap peaks in the quasiparticle density of states $N(\epsilon)$ in the
bulk give rise to a weakly temperature-dependent residual surface resistance.
We show that the surface resistance can be optimized and even reduced below its
value for an ideal surface by engineering $N(\epsilon)$ at the surface using
pairbreaking mechanisms, particularly, by incorporating a small density of
magnetic impurities or by tuning the thickness and conductivity of the normal
layer and its contact resistance. The results of this work address the limit of
$R_s$ in superconductors at $T\ll T_c$, and the ways of engineering the optimal
density of states by surface nano-structuring and impurities to reduce losses
in superconducting micro-resonators, thin film strip lines, and radio frequency
cavities for particle accelerators.

with electron pressure anisotropy likely present in the intracluster medium

the Larmor frequencies of charged particles greatly exceed their collision
frequencies. This permits formation of pressure anisotropies, driven by
evolving magnetic fields via adiabatic invariance, or by heat fluxes. SZ
polarization arises in the process of Compton scattering of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) photons off the thermal ICM electrons due to the
difference in the characteristic thermal velocities of the electrons along two
mutually orthogonal directions in the sky plane. The signal scales linearly
with the optical depth of the region containing large-scale correlated
anisotropy, and with the degree of anisotropy itself. It has the same spectral
dependence as the polarization induced by cluster motion with respect to the
CMB frame (kinematic SZ effect polarization), but can be distinguished by its
spatial pattern. { For the illustrative case of a galaxy cluster with a cold
front, where electron transport is mediated by Coulomb collisions, we estimate
the CMB polarization degree at the level of 10$^{-8}$ ($\sim 10$ nK). An
increase of the effective electron collisionality due to plasma instabilities
will reduce the effect. Such polarization, therefore, may be an independent
probe of the electron collisionality in the ICM, which is one of the key
properties of a high-$\beta$ weakly collisional plasma from the point of view

and Hirata showed in \cite{AH08} that, for John domains satisfying the capacity
density condition (CDC), the doubling property for harmonic measure is
equivalent to the domain being semi-uniform. Our first result removes the John
condition by showing that any domain satisfying the CDC whose harmonic measure
is doubling is semi-uniform. Next, we develop a substitute for some classical
estimates on harmonic measure in nontangentially accessible domains that works
in semi-uniform domains.
  We also show that semi-uniform domains with uniformly rectifiable boundary
have big pieces of chord-arc subdomains. We cannot hope for big pieces of
Lipschitz subdomains (as was shown for chord-arc domains by David and Jerison
\cite{DJ90}) due to an example of Hrycak, which we review in the appendix.
  Finally, we combine these tools to study the $A_{\infty}$-property of
harmonic measure. For a domain with Ahlfors-David regular boundary, it was
shown by Hofmann and Martell that the $A_{\infty}$ property of harmonic measure
implies uniform rectifiability of the boundary \cite{HM15,HLMN17} . Since
$A_{\infty}$-weights are doubling, this also implies the domain is
semi-uniform. Our final result shows that these two properties, semi-uniformity
and uniformly rectifiable boundary, also imply the $A_{\infty}$ property for
harmonic measure, thus classifying geometrically all domains for which this
holds.

then immediately imply singularity formation for finite-energy solutions in

break down in finite time (this was proved in the companion paper [EJE1]).
Third, we establish global regularity in the same domain and in the same scale

regularity of the data (though, these are important for the present

the presence of the swirl. This work and the companion work seem to be the

finite-time singularity formation for the actual $3D$ Euler system.

matter protected by crystalline (and other) symmetries. They are originally
predicted by band theories, so an important question is their stability under
interactions. In this paper, by directly studying the physical bulk properties
of several band-theory-based nontrivial TCIs that are conceptually interesting
and/or experimentally feasible, we show they are stable under interactions.
These TCIs include (1) a weak topological insulator, (2) a TCI with a mirror
symmetry and its time-reversal symmetric generalizations, (3) a doubled
topological insulator with a mirror symmetry, and (4) two TCIs with
symmetry-enforced-gapless surfaces. We describe two complementary methods that
allow us to determine the properties of the magnetic monopoles obtained by
coupling these TCIs to a U(1) gauge field. These methods involve studying
different types of surface states of these TCIs. Applying these methods to our
examples, we find all of them have nontrivial monopoles, which proves their
stability under interactions. Furthermore, we discuss two levels of relations
between these TCIs and symmetry enriched U(1) quantum spin liquids (QSLs).
First, these TCIs are directly related to U(1) QSLs with crystalline
symmetries. Second, there is an interesting correspondence between U(1) QSLs
with crystalline symmetries and U(1) QSLs with internal symmetries. In
particular, the TCIs with symmetry-enforced-gapless surfaces are related to the

specific application, is a crucial problem in modern data science.
Practitioners often optimize over a parameterized algorithm family, tuning
parameters based on problems from their domain. These procedures have
historically come with no guarantees, though a recent line of work studies
algorithm selection from a theoretical perspective. We advance the foundations
of this field in several directions: we analyze online algorithm selection,
where problems arrive one-by-one and the goal is to minimize regret, and
private algorithm selection, where the goal is to find good parameters over a
set of problems without revealing sensitive information contained therein. We
study important algorithm families, including SDP-rounding schemes for problems
formulated as integer quadratic programs, and greedy techniques for canonical
subset selection problems. In these cases, the algorithm's performance is a
volatile and piecewise Lipschitz function of its parameters, since tweaking the
parameters can completely change the algorithm's behavior. We give a sufficient
and general condition, dispersion, defining a family of piecewise Lipschitz
functions that can be optimized online and privately, which includes the
functions measuring the performance of the algorithms we study. Intuitively, a
set of piecewise Lipschitz functions is dispersed if no small region contains
many of the functions' discontinuities. We present general techniques for
online and private optimization of the sum of dispersed piecewise Lipschitz
functions. We improve over the best-known regret bounds for a variety of
problems, prove regret bounds for problems not previously studied, and give
matching lower bounds. We also give matching upper and lower bounds on the
utility loss due to privacy. Moreover, we uncover dispersion in auction design
and pricing problems.

explanation for this metallicity effect. We tested the hypothesis that the
number density of red giant branch (RGB) stars is larger in metal-rich GCs, and
thus potentially the cause of the metallicity effect. Using Hubble Space
Telescope photometry for 109 unique Milky Way GCs, we investigated whether RGB
star density was correlated with GC metallicity. Isochrone fitting was used to
calculate the number of RGB stars, which were normalized by the GC mass and
fraction of observed GC luminosity, and determined density using the volume at
the half-light radius $r_{h}$. The RGB star number density was weakly
correlated with metallicity [Fe/H], giving Spearman and Kendall Rank test
$p$-values of 0.00016 and 0.00021 and coefficients $r_{s} = 0.35$ and $\tau =
0.24$ respectively. This correlation may be biased by a possible dependence of
$r_{h}$ on [Fe/H], although studies have shown that $r_{h}$ is correlated with
Galactocentric distance and independent of [Fe/H]. The dynamical origin of the
$r_{h}$-metallicity correlation (tidal stripping) suggests that metal-rich GCs
may have had more active dynamical histories, which would promote LMXB
formation. No correlation between the RGB star number density and metallicity
was found when using only the GCs that hosted quiescent LMXBs. A complete
census of quiescent LMXBs in our Galaxy is needed to further probe the
metallicity effect, which will be possible with the upcoming launch of eROSITA.

incidence along an approximately N-NE to S-SW route with respect to the current
orientation of the North America continent, at about 750 million years ago (750
Ma), is likely to be the direct cause of a chain of events which led to the
rifting of the Rodinia supercontinent and the severing of the foundation of the
Colorado Plateau from its surrounding craton. It is further argued that the
impactor was most likely a rogue exoplanet, which originated from one of the
past crossings of our Solar System through the Galactic spiral arms, during the
Sun's orbital motion around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. New advances in
galactic dynamics have shown that the sites of galactic spiral arms are
locations of density-wave collisionless shocks. The perturbations from such
shocks are known to lead to the formation of massive stars, which evolve
quickly and die as supernovae. The blastwaves from supernova explosions, in
addition to the spiral-arm collisionless shocks themselves, could perturb the
orbits of the streaming disk matter, occasionally producing rogue exoplanets
that can reach the inner confines of our Solar System. The similarity of the
period of spiral-arm crossings of our Solar System, with the approximate period
of major extinction events in the Phanerozoic Eon of the Earth's history, as

Standard Model of particle physics, such as a $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry breaking
phase transition in the early universe or remnants of superstring theory.
Unlike other topological defects, cosmic strings can reach a scaling regime
that maintains a small fixed fraction of the total energy density of the
universe from a very early epoch until today. If present, they will oscillate
and generate gravitational waves with a frequency spectrum that imprints the
dominant sources of total cosmic energy density throughout the history of the
universe. We demonstrate that current and future gravitational wave detectors,
such as LIGO and LISA, could be capable of measuring the frequency spectrum of
gravitational waves from cosmic strings and discerning the energy composition
of the universe at times well before primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmic
microwave background where standard cosmology has yet to be tested. This work
establishes a benchmark case that gravitational waves may provide an
unprecedented, powerful tool for probing the evolutionary history of the very

of magnitudes smaller than the value expected for a dissipation region located

delays between the $g+i$-band emission and the broad H$\beta$ emission line for

Time delays are computed using the JAVELIN and CREAM software and the
traditional interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF): Using well defined
criteria, we report measurements of 32 H$\beta$ and 13 H$\alpha$ lags with
JAVELIN, 42 H$\beta$ and 17 H$\alpha$ lags with CREAM, and 16 H$\beta$ and 8
H$\alpha$ lags with the ICCF. Lag values are generally consistent among the
three methods, though we typically measure smaller uncertainties with JAVELIN

interpolation and more robust statistical modeling of the former two methods.
The median redshift of our H$\beta$-detected sample of quasars is 0.53,
significantly higher than that of the previous reverberation-mapping sample. We
find that in most objects, the time delay of the H$\alpha$ emission is
consistent with or slightly longer than that of H$\beta$. We measure black hole
masses using our measured time delays and line widths for these quasars. These
black hole mass measurements are mostly consistent with expectations based on
the local M-sigma relationship, and are also consistent with single-epoch black

interacts with a static impurity though a Coulomb interaction, the same scaling
of the kinetic and interaction energies also gives rise to such a Efimov

the vacuum polarization of electron-hole pair fluctuation can still screen the
Coulomb interaction, which leads to derivation from this scaling symmetry and

the Lamb shift for the hydrogen atom. Motivated by recent experimental

information in spacetime. Superdensity operators encode spacetime correlation
functions in an operator framework, and support a natural generalization of
Hilbert space techniques and Dirac's transformation theory as traditionally
applied to standard density operators. Superdensity operators can be measured
experimentally, but accessing their full content requires novel procedures. We
demonstrate these statements on several examples. The superdensity formalism
suggests useful definitions of spacetime entropies and spacetime quantum
channels. For example, we show that the von Neumann entropy of a superdensity
operator is related to a quantum generalization of the Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy, and compute this for a many-body system. We also suggest experimental
protocols for measuring spacetime entropies.

direction. We thoroughly analize and characterize two different emission
regions in the angle-energy domain: (i) the parallel-like region with
contribution of two classical trajectories per optical cycle and (ii) the
perpendicular-like region with contribution of four classical trajectories per
optical cycle. We show that our semiclassical model is able to asses the
interference patterns of the angle-resolved photoelectron spectrum in the two
different mentioned regions. Electron trajectories stemming from different
optical laser cycles give rise to angle-independent intercycle interference
known as sidebands. These sidebands are modulated by an angle-dependent
coarse-grained structure coming from the intracycle interference of the
electron trajectories born during the same optical cycle. We show the accuracy
of our semiclassical model as a function of the time delay between the IR and

ground truth 3D information, but suffered from domain adaptation when tested on
real data. In this work, we propose MarrNet, an end-to-end trainable model that
sequentially estimates 2.5D sketches and 3D object shape. Our disentangled,
two-step formulation has three advantages. First, compared to full 3D shape,
2.5D sketches are much easier to be recovered from a 2D image; models that
recover 2.5D sketches are also more likely to transfer from synthetic to real
data. Second, for 3D reconstruction from 2.5D sketches, systems can learn
purely from synthetic data. This is because we can easily render realistic 2.5D
sketches without modeling object appearance variations in real images,
including lighting, texture, etc. This further relieves the domain adaptation
problem. Third, we derive differentiable projective functions from 3D shape to
2.5D sketches; the framework is therefore end-to-end trainable on real images,
requiring no human annotations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance

ordering called nestedness. On the other hand, theoretical works have shown
that a nested structure has a positive impact on a number of relevant features
ranging from species coexistence to a higher structural stability of
communities and biodiversity. However, how nestedness emerges and what are its
determinants, are still open challenges that have led to multiple debates to
date. Here, we show, by applying a theoretical approach to the analysis of 167
real mutualistic networks, that nestedness is not an irreducible feature, but a
consequence of the degree sequences of both guilds of the mutualistic network.
Remarkably, we find that an outstanding majority of the analyzed networks does

distribution can be explained by an increase of the maximum flowable, or
jamming, solid fraction ${\phi}_m$. In this work, dense suspensions are
simulated under strong shearing, where thermal motion and repulsive forces are
negligible, but we allow for particle contact with a mild frictional
interaction with interparticle friction coefficient of ${\mu} = 0.2$. Aspects
of bidisperse suspension rheology are first revisited to establish that the
approach reproduces established trends; the study of bidisperse suspensions at
size ratios of large to small particle radii of $\delta = 2$ to 4 shows that a
minimum in the viscosity occurs for ${\zeta}$ slightly above 0.5, where $\zeta
= {\phi}_l/{\phi}$ is the fraction of the total solid volume occupied by the
large particles. The simple shear flows of polydisperse suspensions with
truncated normal and log normal size distributions, and bidisperse suspensions
which are statistically equivalent with these polydisperse cases up to third
moment of the size distribution, are simulated and the rheologies are
extracted. Prior work shows that such distributions with equivalent low-order
moments have similar ${\phi}_m$, and the rheological behaviors of normal, log
normal and bidisperse cases are shown to be in close agreement for a wide range
of standard deviation in particle size, with standard correlations which are
functionally dependent on ${\phi}/{\phi}_m$ providing excellent agreement with
the rheology found in simulation. The close agreement of both viscosity and

axis misaligned with the planet's orbital angular momentum axis. The origin of
this spin-orbit misalignment and the formation mechanism of HJs remain poorly
understood. A number of recent works have suggested that gravitational
interactions between host stars, protoplanetary disks, and inclined binary
companions may tilt the stellar spin axis with respect to the disk's angular
angular momentum axis, producing planetary systems with misaligned orbits.
These previous works considered idealized disk evolution models and neglected
the gravitational influence of newly formed planets. In this paper, we explore
how disk photoevaporation and planet formation and migration affect the
inclination evolution of planet-star-disk-binary systems. We take into account
planet-disk interactions and the gravitational spin-orbit coupling between the
host star and the planet. We find that the rapid depletion of the inner disk
via photoevaporation reduces the excitation of stellar obliquities. Depending
on the formation and migration history of HJs, the spin-orbit coupling between
the star and the planet may reduces and even completely suppress the excitation
of stellar obliquities. Our work constrains the formation/migration history of
HJs. On the other hand, planetary systems with ""cold"" Jupiters or close-in
super-earths may experience excitation of stellar obliquities in the presence
of distant inclined companions.

associated with the so-called ""topological trigger"" of magnetic reconnection,
which was theoretically suggested long time ago by Gorbachev et al. (Sov. Ast.
1988, v.32, p.308) but has not been clearly identified so far by observations.
As can be seen in pictures by Hinode SOT in CaII line, there may be a bright
loop connecting two sunspots, which looks at the first sight just as a magnetic
field line connecting the opposite poles. However, a closer inspection of SDO
HMI magnetograms shows that the respective arc is anchored in the regions of
the same polarity near the sunspot boundaries. Yet another peculiar feature is
that the arc flashes almost instantly as a thin strip and then begins to expand
and decay, while the typical chromospheric flares in CaII line are much wider
and propagate progressively in space. A qualitative explanation of the unusual
flare can be given by the above-mentioned model of topological trigger. Namely,
there are such configurations of the magnetic sources on the surface of
photosphere that their tiny displacements result in the formation and fast
motion of a 3D null point along the arc located well above the plane of the
sources. So, such a null point can quickly ignite a magnetic reconnection along
the entire its trajectory. Pictorially, this can be presented as flipping the
so-called two-dome magnetic-field structure (which is just the reason why such
mechanism was called topological). The most important prerequisite for the
development of topological instability in the two-dome structure is a cruciform
arrangement of the magnetic sources in its base, and this condition is really
satisfied in the case under consideration.

their structural similarities and differences. Such analyses predict the
presence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)
correlations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,
isovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all
play a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar and
pseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame
wave functions are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in
this $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance of a radial excitation of the ground
state. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:
accurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector
diquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark
cores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the
associated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess
measurable $S$-wave components. Moreover, the first excited state in each
negative-parity channel has little of the appearance of a radial excitation. In
quantum field theory, all differences between positive- and negative-parity
channels must owe to chiral symmetry breaking, which is overwhelmingly
dynamical in the light-quark sector. Consequently, experiments that can
validate the contrasts drawn herein between the structure of the four lightest

distributions for a parameter (e.g., Poisson or gamma rate, inverse scale or

exponential subclass of discrete and continuous data distributions. The prior
class is proper, nonzero at the origin (unlike the gamma and inverted beta
priors with shape parameter less than one and Jeffreys prior for a Poisson
rate), and is easy to generate random numbers from. The prior class also
provides flexibility in capturing a wide array of prior beliefs (right-skewed
and left-skewed) as modulated by a bounded parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1).$ The
resulting posterior family in the single-parameter case can be expressed in
closed-form and is proper, making calibration unnecessary. The mixing induced
by the inverse stable family results to a marginal prior distribution in the
form of a generalized Mittag-Leffler function, which covers a broad array of
distributional shapes. We derive closed-form expressions of some properties
like the moment generating function and moments. We propose algorithms to
generate samples from the posterior distribution and calculate the Bayes
estimators for real data analysis. We formulate the predictive prior and
posterior distributions. We test the proposed Bayes estimators using Monte
Carlo simulations. The extension to hierarchical modeling and inverse variance
components models is straightforward. We can find $\alpha$ (which acts like a
smoothing parameter) values for which the inverse stable can provide better
shrinkage than the inverted beta prior in many cases. We illustrate the
methodology using a real data set, introduce a hyperprior density for the
hyperparameters, and extend the model to a heavy-tailed distribution.

due to its high heliocentric hyperbolic excess velocity of about 26 km/s; much
faster than any vehicle yet launched. This paper presents a high-level analysis
of potential near-term options for a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua and potential
similar objects. Launching a spacecraft to 1I/'Oumuamua in a reasonable
timeframe of 5-10 years requires a hyperbolic solar system excess velocity
between 33 to 76 km/s for mission durations between 30 to 5 years. Different
mission durations and their velocity requirements are explored with respect to
the launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept
trajectory. For missions using a powered Jupiter flyby combined with a solar
Oberth maneuver using solid rocket boosters and Parker Solar Probe heat shield
technology, a Falcon Heavy-class launcher would be able to launch a spacecraft
of dozens of kilograms towards 1I/'Oumuamua, if launched in 2021. An additional
Saturn flyby would allow for the launch of a New Horizons-class spacecraft.
Further technology options are outlined, ranging from electric propulsion, and
more advanced options such as laser electric propulsion, and solar and laser
sails. To maximize science return decelerating the spacecraft at 'Oumuamua is
highly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity
encounter. Electric and magnetic sails could be used for this purpose. It is
concluded that although reaching the object is challenging, there seem to be
feasible options based on current and near-term technology.

discrete state space. A discrete time mean field game (MFG) is motivated as an
interpretable model founded on game theory for understanding the aggregate
effect of individual actions and predicting the temporal evolution of
population distributions. We achieve a synthesis of MFG and Markov decision
processes (MDP) by showing that a special MFG is reducible to an MDP. This
enables us to broaden the scope of mean field game theory and infer MFG models

learns both the reward function and forward dynamics of an MFG from real data,

possibly a hybrid Fanaroff-Riley FRI/II (or Fat Double) radio morphology. The
Chandra observations reveal a point-like source which is well fit with a power
law consistent with emission from a Doppler boosted core. 3C 268.3 is a CSS
broad line radio galaxy whose Chandra data are consistent spatially with a
point source centered on the nucleus and spectrally with a double power-law
model. PKS B1017-325 is a low excitation emission line radio galaxy with a bent
double radio morphology. While from our new spectroscopic redshift, PKS
B1017-325 falls outside the formal definition of a CSS, the XMNM-Newton
observations are consistent with ISM emission with either a contribution from
hot shocked gas or non-thermal jet emission. We compile selected radio and
X-ray properties of the nine bona fide CSS radio galaxies with X-ray detections
so far. We find that 2/9 show X-ray spectroscopic evidence for hot shocked gas.
We note that the counts in the sources are low and the properties of the 2
sources with evidence for hot shocked gas are typical of the other CSS radio
galaxies. We suggest that hot shocked gas may be typical of CSS radio galaxies
due to their propagation through their host galaxies.

into the standard cosmological codes such as CAMB and CLASS usually treat the
surface of last scatter as an infinitely thin screen. However, since the CMB
anisotropies are smoothed out on scales smaller than the diffusion length due
to the effect of Silk damping, the photons which carry information about the
small-scale density distribution come from slightly earlier times than the
standard recombination time. The dominant effect is the scale dependence of the
mean redshift associated with the fluctuations during recombination. We find
that fluctuations at $k = 0.01 {\rm \ Mpc^{-1}}$ come from a characteristic
redshift of $z \approx 1090$, while fluctuations at $k = 0.3 {\rm \ Mpc^{-1}}$
come from a characteristic redshift of $z \approx 1130$. We then estimate the
corrections to the lensing kernel and the related power spectra due to this
effect. We conclude that neglecting it would result in a deviation from the
true value of the lensing kernel at the half percent level at small CMB scales.
For an all-sky, noise-free experiment, this corresponds to a $\sim 0.1 \sigma$
shift in the observed temperature power spectrum on small scales ($ 2500

European Southern Observatory. The principal motivation of this work is to
perform a wide and detailed chemical abundance analysis of the cluster and look
for possible Multiple Populations (MPs). We determined stellar parameters and
measured 22 elements corresponding to light (Na, Al), alpha (O, Mg, Si, Ca,
Ti), iron-peak (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and heavy elements (Y, Zr,
Ba, Ce, Nd, Eu). We found a mean iron content of [Fe/H]=-0.47 $\pm$0.02 (error
on the mean). We confirm the existence of MPs in this GC with an O-Na
anti-correlation, and moderate spread in Al abundances. We estimate a mean
[$\alpha$/Fe]=0.25 $\pm$0.08. Iron-peak elements shows no significant spread.
The [Ba/Eu] ratios indicate a predominant contribution from SNeII for the
formation of the cluster.

this paper, we propose a multi-stage framework for suture thread detection

the initial detection and the overlapping status of suture thread, which are
later fused with the original image to learn a gradient road map of the thread.
Based on the gradient road map, multiple segments of the thread are extracted
and linked to form the whole thread using a curvilinear structure detector.
Experiments on two different types of sutures demonstrate the accuracy of the

it is shown that quantum -modified lower hybrid (QLH) wave in electron positron

electron and positrons are activated whereas ions remain in the background) and
another ultra low frequency QULH (where ions are mobile). Quantum effects like
Bohm potential, exchange correlation and Fermi pressure on the lower hybrid
wave significantly reshaped the dispersion properties of lower hybrid waves.
Later a set of nonlinear Zakharov equations have been derived to consider the
formation of QLH wave solitons with the nonlinear contribution coming from the
QLH waves. Further, modulational instability of the lower hybrid wave solitons
is investigated and consequently it's growth rates are examined for different
limiting cases. Since the growth rate associated with the three-wave resonant
interaction are generally smaller than the growth associated with the
modulational instability, therefore only latter have been investigated. Soliton
solutions from the set of coupled Zakharov and NLS equations in the
quasi-stationary regime have been studied. Ordinary solitons are attribute of
nonlinearity whereas a cusp soliton solution featured by nonlocal nonlinearity
have also studied. Such an approach to lower hybrid waves and cusp solitons
study in Fermi gas comprising electron positron and ions is new and important.
The general results obtained in this quantum plasma theory will have widespread

each step $t$ the learner has to combine the point forecasts of the experts
issued for the time interval $[t+1, t+d]$ ahead. Our approach implies that at
each time step experts issue point forecasts for arbitrary many steps ahead and
then the learner (algorithm) combines these forecasts and the forecasts made
earlier into one vector forecast for steps $[t+1,t+d]$. By combining past and

includes: a (personalized) mandrel module, a bimanual sewing module, and a
vision module. The mandrel module incorporates the personalized geometry of
patients, while the bimanual sewing module adopts a learning-by-demonstration
approach to transfer human hand-sewing skills to the robots. The human
demonstrations were firstly observed by the vision module and then encoded
using a statistical model to generate the reference motion trajectories. During
autonomous robot sewing, the vision module plays the role of coordinating
multi-robot collaboration. Experiment results show that the robots can adapt to
generalized stent designs. The proposed system can also be used for other
manipulation tasks, especially for flexible production of customized products
and where bimanual or multi-robot cooperation is required.

equally-divided delay scheme which under certain conditions is the optimal

field inferred from the nonlinear displacement correlates with the linear
initial conditions to much smaller scales than the redshift space density
field. The number of linear modes in the density field is improved by a factor
of 30-40 after reconstruction. We thus expect this reconstruction approach to
substantially expand the cosmological information including baryon acoustic
oscillations and redshift space distortions for dense low-redshift large scale

probabilistic programming languages, as used in data science and machine
learning. Sophisticated inference algorithms are often explained in terms of
composition of smaller parts. However, neither their theoretical justification
nor their implementation reflects this modularity. We show how to conceptualise
and analyse such inference algorithms as manipulating intermediate
representations of probabilistic programs using higher-order functions and
inductive types, and their denotational semantics. Semantic accounts of
continuous distributions use measurable spaces. However, our use of
higher-order functions presents a substantial technical difficulty: it is
impossible to define a measurable space structure over the collection of
measurable functions between arbitrary measurable spaces that is compatible
with standard operations on those functions, such as function application. We
overcome this difficulty using quasi-Borel spaces, a recently proposed
mathematical structure that supports both function spaces and continuous
distributions. We define a class of semantic structures for representing
probabilistic programs, and semantic validity criteria for transformations of
these representations in terms of distribution preservation. We develop a
collection of building blocks for composing representations. We use these
building blocks to validate common inference algorithms such as Sequential
Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. To emphasize the connection between
the semantic manipulation and its traditional measure theoretic origins, we use
Kock's synthetic measure theory. We demonstrate its usefulness by proving a
quasi-Borel counterpart to the Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem.

It becomes particularly challenging when focusing on weakly-supervised relation
extraction, that is, utilizing a few relation instances (i.e., a pair of
entities and their relation) as seeds to extract more instances from corpora.
Existing distributional approaches leverage the corpus-level co-occurrence
statistics of entities to predict their relations, and require large number of
labeled instances to learn effective relation classifiers. Alternatively,
pattern-based approaches perform bootstrapping or apply neural networks to
model the local contexts, but still rely on large number of labeled instances

distributional and pattern-based methods in a weakly-supervised setting, such
that the two types of methods can provide complementary supervision for each

the distributional module helps the pattern module discriminate between the
informative patterns and other patterns, and the pattern module generates some
highly-confident instances to improve the distributional module. The whole
framework can be effectively optimized by iterating between improving the
pattern module and updating the distributional module. We conduct experiments
on two tasks: knowledge base completion with text corpora and corpus-level
relation extraction. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our
framework in the weakly-supervised setting.

behavior. The band offset and charge transfer are related to the interface
spacing. The valence band offset (VBO) and charge transfer will decrease with

schemes for linear scalar hyperbolic equations with discontinuous coefficients.
In many numerical schemes of Godunov type used in fluid dynamics,
electromagnetic, electro-hydrodynamic problems and so on, usually a Riemann
problem needs to be solved to estimate fluxes. The exact solution is generally
not possible to obtain, but good approximations are provided in many situations
like Roe and HLLC Riemann solvers in fluids. However all these solvers assume
that the acoustic waves speed are continuous by considering some averaging.
This could unfortunately lead to a wrong solution as we will show in this paper
for the linear scalar case. Providing a Riemann solver in the general case of
non-linear hyperbolic systems with discontinuous waves speed is a very hard
task, therefore in this paper and as a first step, we focus on the linear and
scalar case. In a previous work we proposed for such problems a Riemann
solution that takes into account the discontinuities of the waves speed, we
provided a numerical argument to show the validity of the solution. In this
paper, first a new argument using regularization technique is provided to
reinforce the validity of the proposed solution. Then, the corresponding
Godunov scheme is derived and the effect of waves speed averaging is clearly
demonstrated with a clear connection to the distribution product phenomenon.

vortex sheet given by the Birkhoff-Rott equation to obtain fundamental insights
about the potential for stabilization of shear layers using feedback control.
As actuation we consider two arrays of point sinks/sources located a certain
distance above and below the vortex sheet and subject to the constraint that
their mass fluxes separately add up to zero. First, we demonstrate using
analytical computations that the Birkhoff-Rott equation linearized around the
flat-sheet configuration is in fact controllable when the number of actuator
pairs is sufficiently large relative to the number of discrete degrees of
freedom present in the system, a result valid for generic actuator locations.
Next we design a state-based LQR stabilization strategy where the key
difficulty is the numerical solution of the Riccati equation in the presence of
severe ill-conditioning resulting from the properties of the Birkhoff-Rott
equation and the chosen form of actuation, an issue which is overcome by
performing computations with a suitably increased arithmetic precision.
Analysis of the linear closed-loop system reveals exponential decay of the
perturbation energy and of the corresponding actuation energy in all cases.
Computations performed for the nonlinear closed-loop system demonstrate that
initial perturbations of nonnegligible amplitude can be effectively stabilized
when a sufficient number of actuators is used. We also thoroughly analyze the
sensitivity of the closed-loop stabilization strategies to the variation of a
number of key parameters. Subject to the known limitations of inviscid vortex
models, our findings indicate that, in principle, it may be possible to
stabilize shear layers for relatively large initial perturbations, provided the
actuation has sufficiently many degrees of freedom.

high stability, environmental safety, anomalously high photovoltages, coupled

extremely low photocurrents, which is primarily due to their wide band gaps.
Here, we present a new class of FPVs by demonstrating switchable ferroelectric
photovoltaic effects using hexagonal ferrite (h-RFeO3) thin films having narrow
band gaps of ~1.2 eV, where R denotes rare-earth ions. FPVs with narrow band
gaps suggests their potential applicability as photovoltaic and optoelectronic
devices. The h-RFeO3 films further exhibit reasonably large ferroelectric
polarizations, which possibly reduces a rapid recombination rate of the
photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of
h-RFeO3 thin-film devices is sensitive on the magnitude of polarization. In the
case of h-TmFeO3 (h-TFO) thin film, the measured PCE is twice as large as that
of the BiFeO3 thin film, a prototypic FPV. We have further shown that the
switchable photovoltaic effect dominates over the unswitchable internal field
effect arising from the net built-in potential. This work thus demonstrates a
new class of FPVs towards high-efficiency solar cell and optoelectronic
applications.

claimed that (i) simple (""MS"") estimators of diversification rates perform much
better than BAMM, and (ii) evolutionary rates inferred with BAMM are weakly
correlated with the true rates in the generating model. I demonstrate that
their assessment suffers from two major conceptual errors that invalidate both
primary conclusions. These statistical considerations are not specific to BAMM
and apply to all methods for estimating parameters from empirical data where
the true grouping structure of the data is unknown. First, M&W\'s comparisons
between BAMM and MS estimators suffer from false equivalency because the MS
estimators are given perfect prior knowledge of the locations of rate shifts on
the simulated phylogenies. BAMM is given no such information and must
simultaneously estimate the number and location of rate shifts from the data,
thus resulting in a massive degrees-of-freedom advantage for the MS
estimators.When both methods are given equivalent information, BAMM
dramatically outperforms the MS estimators. Second, M&W\'s experimental design
is unable to assess parameter reliability because their analyses conflate small
effect sizes across treatment groups with error in parameter estimates. Nearly
all model-based frameworks for partitioning data are susceptible to the
statistical mistakes in M&W, including popular clustering algorithms in

In this method, the coupling path of radio telescope is divided into strong
coupling and weak coupling sub-paths, and the coupling intensity criterion is
proposed by analyzing the conditions that BLT equation simplifies to transfer
function. According to the coupling intensity criterion, the topological model
of a typical radio telescope system is established. The proposed method is used
to solve the interference response of the radio telescope system by analyzing
the subsystems with different coupling modes respectively and then integrating
the responses of the subsystems as the response of the entire system. The
validity of the proposed method is verified numerically. The results indicate
that the proposed method, compared with the direct solving method, reduces the
difficulty and improves the efficiency of the interference prediction.

multiple vertical takeooff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
The case of unidirectional information flow is considered and the objective is
to drive all the follower VTOL UAVs to accurately track the trajectory of the
leader. Firstly, a novel distributed estimator is developed for each VTOL UAV
to obtain the leader's desired information asymptotically. With the outputs of
the estimators, the solution to the coordinated trajectory tracking problem of
multiple VTOL UAVs is transformed to individually solving the tracking problem
of each VTOL UAV. Due to the under-actuated nature of the VTOL UAV, a
hierarchical framework is introduced for each VTOL UAV such that a command
force and an applied torque are exploited in sequence, then the position
tracking to the estimated desired position and the attitude tracking to the
command attitude are achieved. Moreover, an auxiliary system with proper
parameters is implemented to guarantee the singularity-free command attitude
extraction and to obviate the use of the unavailable desired information. The
stability analysis and simulations effectively validate the achievement of the
coordinated trajectory tracking of multiple VTOL UAVs with the proposed control
approach.

our best knowledge, this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene

motion prediction by decomposing optical flow into different groups while
optical flow estimation brings reliable pixel-wise correspondence to scene
parsing. By exploiting this mutually beneficial relationship, our model shows
significantly better parsing and motion prediction results when compared to
well-established baselines and individual prediction models on the large-scale

correctness proofs for concurrent data structures. However, a recurring problem
in such proofs is that data structure abstractions that work well in the
sequential setting are much harder to reason about in a concurrent setting due
to complex sharing and overlays. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
approach to abstracting regions in the heap by encoding the data structure
invariant into a local condition on each individual node. This condition may
depend on a quantity associated with the node that is computed as a fixpoint
over the entire heap graph. We refer to this quantity as a flow. Flows can
encode both structural properties of the heap (e.g. the reachable nodes from
the root form a tree) as well as data invariants (e.g. sortedness). We then
introduce the notion of a flow interface, which expresses the relies and
guarantees that a heap region imposes on its context to maintain the local flow
invariant with respect to the global heap. Our main technical result is that
this notion leads to a new semantic model of separation logic. In this model,
flow interfaces provide a general abstraction mechanism for describing complex
data structures. This abstraction mechanism admits proof rules that generalize
over a wide variety of data structures. To demonstrate the versatility of our
approach, we show how to extend the logic RGSep with flow interfaces. We have
used this new logic to prove linearizability and memory safety of nontrivial
concurrent data structures. In particular, we obtain parametric linearizability
proofs for concurrent dictionary algorithms that abstract from the details of
the underlying data structure representation. These proofs cannot be easily
expressed using the abstraction mechanisms provided by existing separation
logics.

Recently, researchers generally adopt the deep networks to capture the static
and motion information \textbf{\emph{separately}}, which mainly has two
limitations: (1) Ignoring the coexistence relationship between spatial and
temporal attention, while they should be jointly modelled as the spatial and
temporal evolutions of video, thus discriminative video features can be
extracted.(2) Ignoring the strong complementarity between static and motion
information coexisted in video, while they should be collaboratively learned to
boost each other. For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes
the approach of two-stream collaborative learning with spatial-temporal
attention (TCLSTA), which consists of two models: (1) Spatial-temporal
attention model: The spatial-level attention emphasizes the salient regions in
frame, and the temporal-level attention exploits the discriminative frames in
video. They are jointly learned and mutually boosted to learn the
discriminative static and motion features for better classification
performance. (2) Static-motion collaborative model: It not only achieves mutual
guidance on static and motion information to boost the feature learning, but
also adaptively learns the fusion weights of static and motion streams, so as
to exploit the strong complementarity between static and motion information to
promote video classification. Experiments on 4 widely-used datasets show that
our TCLSTA approach achieves the best performance compared with more than 10
state-of-the-art methods.

two whispering-gallery resonators (WGRs) are investigated theoretically. With a
real-space full quantum theory, photonic scattering amplitudes along four ports
of the waveguide network are analytically obtained. It is shown that, by
adjusting the geometric and physical parameters of the two-WGR configuration,
the quantum routing properties of single photons along the present waveguide
network can be controlled effectively. For example, the routing capability from
input waveguide to another one can significantly exceed 0.5 near the resonance
point of scattering spectra, which can be achieved with only one resonator. By
properly designing the distance between two WGRs and the waveguide-WGR coupling
strengths, the transfer rate between the waveguides can also reach certain
sufficiently high values even in the non-resonance regime. Moreover, Fano-like
resonances in the scattering spectra are designable. The proposed system may
provide a potential application in controlling single-photon quantum routing as
a novel router.

microscopic properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), encompassing both
light- and heavy-parton degrees of freedom in a unified framework. The starting
point is a relativistic effective Hamiltonian with a universal color force. The
input in-medium potential is quantitatively constrained by computing the
heavy-quark (HQ) free energy from the static $T$-matrix and fitting it to
pertinent lattice-QCD (lQCD) data. The corresponding $T$-matrix is then applied
to compute the equation of state (EoS) of the QGP in a two-particle irreducible
formalism including the full off-shell properties of the selfconsistent
single-parton spectral functions and their two-body interaction. In particular,
the skeleton diagram functional is fully resummed to account for emerging bound
and scattering states as the critical temperature is approached from above. We
find that the solution satisfying three sets of lQCD data (EoS, HQ free energy
and quarkonium correlator ratios) is not unique. As limiting cases we discuss a
weakly-coupled solution (WCS) which features color-potentials close to the free
energy, relatively sharp quasiparticle spectral functions and weak hadronic
resonances near $T_{\rm c}$, and a strongly-coupled solution (SCS) with a
strong color potential (much larger than the free energy) resulting in broad
non-quasiparticle parton spectral functions and strong hadronic resonance
states which dominate the EoS when approaching $T_{\rm c}$.

that TR-HHS, which can track both the electronic and the nuclear dynamics, is a

find a relation between the pre-merger masses and the final white dwarf mass.
Combining our results with a model population, we predict that the mass

which each agent is faced with the decision of how to allocate his capital

investors, derived through an optimization, drives the stock price. The model
has been inspired by the econophysical Levy-Levy-Solomon model (Economics
Letters, 45). The goal of this work is to gain insights into the stock price
and wealth distribution. We especially want to discover the causes for the
appearance of power-laws in financial data. We follow a kinetic approach
similar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean
field limit of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is
that the financial agents apply model predictive control (MPC) to approximate
and solve the optimization of their utility function. Interestingly, the MPC
approach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic
concepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational.
Furthermore, this is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which
considers a wealth and stock price distribution simultaneously. Due to our
kinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a
mesoscopic level. The wealth distribution is characterized by a lognormal law.
For the stock price distribution, we can either observe a lognormal behavior in
the case of long-term investors or a power-law in the case of high-frequency
trader. Furthermore, the stock return data exhibits a fat-tail, which is a well
known characteristic of real financial data.

algebras of conserved quantities of the Higgs oscillator. Our conversion
procedure (""Klein-Gordonization"") reduces to a nonlinear elliptic equation

problem of differential geometry. As an illustration, we explicitly demonstrate
how to apply this procedure to superintegrable Rosochatius systems, resulting
in a large family of spacetimes with resonant spectra for massless wave

of a tripartite system in a non-Markovian environment is examined. The total
coherence can be decomposed into various contributions, ranging from local,
global bipartite and global tripartite, which characterize the type of state.
We identify coherence revivals for non-Markovian systems for all the
contributions of coherence. The local coherence is found to be much more robust
under the environmental coupling due to an effective smaller coupling to the
reservoir. This allows us to devise a characterization of a quantum state in
terms of a coherence tuple on a multipartite state simply by examining various
combinations of reservoir couplings. The effect of the environment on the
shareability of quantum coherence, as defined using the monogamy of coherence,
is investigated and found that the sign of the monogamy is a preserved quantity
under the decoherence. We conjecture that the monogamy of coherence is a
conserved property under local incoherent processes.

which enables animals to adjust their behavior to the ever-changing external
environment. Changes in synaptic efficacy between neurons constitute one of the
major mechanisms of plasticity. Therefore, estimation of neural connections is
crucial for investigating information processing in the brain. Although many
analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, most of them suffer from
one or all the following mathematical difficulties: (1) only partially observed
neural activity is available; (2) correlations can include both direct and
indirect pseudo-interactions; and (3) biological evidence that a neuron
typically has only one type of connection (excitatory or inhibitory) should be
considered. To overcome these difficulties, a novel probabilistic framework for
estimating neural connections from partially observed spikes is proposed in
this paper. First, based on the property of a sum of random variables, the
proposed method estimates the influence of unobserved neurons on observed
neurons and extracts only the correlations among observed neurons. Second, the
relationship between pseudo-correlations and target connections is modeled by
neural propagation in a multiplicative manner. Third, a novel
information-theoretic framework is proposed for estimating neuron types. The
proposed method was validated using spike data generated by artificial neural
networks. In addition, it was applied to multi-unit data recorded from the CA1
area of a rat's hippocampus. The results confirmed that our estimates are
consistent with previous reports. These findings indicate that the proposed
method is useful for extracting crucial interactions in neural signals as well
as in other multi-probed point process data.

looking at the codebook matrix not row-wise (codewords), but column-wise. The
family of weak flip codes is presented and shown to contain many beautiful
properties. In particular the subfamily fair weak flip codes, which goes back
to Berlekamp, Gallager, and Shannon and which was shown to achieve the error
exponent with a fixed number of codewords $M$, can be seen as a generalization
of linear codes to an arbitrary number of codewords. Based on the column-wise
approach, the $r$-wise Hamming distance is introduced as a generalization to
the widely used (pairwise) Hamming distance. It is shown that the minimum
$r$-wise Hamming distance satisfies a generalized $r$-wise Plotkin bound. The
$r$-wise Hamming distance structure of the nonlinear fair weak flip codes is
analyzed and shown to be superior to many codes. In particular, it is proven
that the fair weak flip codes achieve the $r$-wise Plotkin bound with equality
for all $r$. In the second part of the paper, these insights are applied to a
binary erasure channel (BEC) with an arbitrary erasure probability. An exact
formula for the average error probability of an arbitrary code using maximum
likelihood decoding is derived and shown to be expressible using only the
$r$-wise Hamming distance structure of the code. For a number of codewords
$M\leq4$ and an arbitrary blocklength $n$, the globally optimal codes (in the
sense of minimizing the average error probability) are found. For $M=5,6$ and
an arbitrary blocklength $n$, the optimal codes are conjectured. For larger
$M$, observations regarding the optimal design are presented, e.g., that good
codes have a large $r$-wise Hamming distance structure for all $r$. Numerical

south of Sri Lanka and bends northeastward to form a swift jet that enters the
Bay of Bengal (BoB). As such, it is a crucial part of the water exchange
between the Arabian Sea (AS) and BoB. The processes that determine the
evolution, intensification and meandering of the SMC are only partly
understood. They involve both local and remote forcing by the wind, as well as
interactions with westward-propagating Rossby waves and eddies. In this study,
we investigate these processes using an Indian-Ocean general circulation model
(MOM4p1) that is capable of simulating the SMC realistcally. Because eddies and
meanders are smoothed out in the climatology, our analyses focus on a single
year of 2009, a period when a strong anticyclonic bend in the SMC was observed.
An eddy-kinetic-energy budget analysis shows the region to be a zone of
significant eddy activity, where both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities
are active. Based on the analysis, we classify the evolution of SMC into stages
of onset, intensification, anticyclonic bend, anticyclonic vortex formation,
meandering and termination. In addition, analysis of eddy-potential-vorticity
flux and eddy-enstrophy decay reveal when, where, and how the eddies tend to
drive the mean flow. Rossby waves and westward-propagating eddies arriving from
the east energize the SMC in June and accelerate the mean flow through an
up-gradient eddy-potential-vorticity flux. At the same time, local winds also
strengthen the flow, by increasing its mean, near-surface, kinetic energy and
raising isopycnals, the latter building up available potential energy (APE).
The baroclinic instability that takes place in late--July and early--August
releases APE, thereby generating the SMC meanders.

practical discussions including useful recommendations. By using the method of
characteristics, the solutions of some problem classes under
convexity/concavity conditions on Hamiltonians (in particular, the solutions of
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in optimal control problems) are evaluated
separately at different initial positions. This allows for the avoidance of the
curse of dimensionality, as well as for choosing arbitrary computational
regions. The corresponding feedback control strategies are obtained at selected
positions without approximating the partial derivatives of the solutions. The
results of numerical simulations demonstrate the high potential of the proposed
techniques. It is also pointed out that, despite the indicated advantages, the
related approaches still have a limited range of applicability, and their
extensions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations in zero-sum two-player
differential games are currently developed only for sufficiently narrow classes

a view to further justifying the group-theoretical method, the problem is first
studied from the viewpoint of classical mechanics. Then the radial probability
densities predicted by classical mechanics are compared with those predicted
from solutions of the problem obtained by the group-theoretical method. The
comparisons clearly indicate the convergence of predictions of quantum

system based on complex, high-dimensional, highly uncertain measurement streams
such as videos. Such a state, or representation, should contain all and only
the information needed for control, and discount nuisance variability in the
data. It should also have finite complexity, ideally modulated depending on
available resources. This representation is what we want to store in memory in
lieu of the data, as it ""separates"" the control task from the measurement
process. For the trivial case with no dynamics, a representation can be
inferred by minimizing the Information Bottleneck Lagrangian in a function
class realized by deep neural networks. The resulting representation has much
higher dimension than the data, already in the millions, but it is smaller in
the sense of information content, retaining only what is needed for the task.
This process also yields representations that are invariant to nuisance factors
and having maximally independent components. We extend these ideas to the
dynamic case, where the representation is the posterior density of the task
variable given the measurements up to the current time, which is in general
much simpler than the prediction density maintained by the classical Bayesian
filter. Again this can be finitely-parametrized using a deep neural network,
and already some applications are beginning to emerge. No explicit assumption
of Markovianity is needed; instead, complexity trades off approximation of an
optimal representation, including the degree of Markovianity.

metrics: Imaginary part of Coherency (IC), generalized Partial Directed
Coherence (gPDC) and frequency--domain Granger Causality (fGC). In order to
assess the statistical significance of the estimated values, we use the
surrogate data test by generating phase--randomized and autoregressive

courses exactly. Here we show how, expectedly, even exact knowledge of the
source time courses is not sufficient to provide reliable estimates of the
connectivity when the number of samples gets small; however, while gPDC and fGC
tend to provide a larger number of false positives, the IC becomes less
sensitive to the presence of connectivity. Then we proceed with more realistic
simulations, where the source time courses are estimated using eLORETA, and the
EEG signal is affected by biological noise of increasing intensity. Using the
ideal case as a reference, we show that the impact of biological noise on IC
estimates is qualitatively different from the impact on gPDC and fGC.

sets of codimension one is studied. It is shown, that if an attractor is a
topological submanifold of codimension one of type $(n-1, 1)$, then it is
smoothly embedded in ambient manifold and restriction of the endomorphism to
this basic set is an expanding endomorphism. If a basic set of type $(n, 0)$ is
a topological submanifold of codimension one, then it is a repeller and
restriction of the endomorphism to this basic set is also an expanding
endomorphism.

therefore, the error associated with their omission can be made negligible; 2)
additional prescriptions for the definition of cross-sections are not required;

squared term in this expansion and the dark energy scale $\Lambda=(\lambda
M_{\rm Pl})^4$ in four dimensional Planck mass units. We show how the
compatibility between the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe,
local tests of gravity and the quantum stability of the model all converge to
select such a relationship up to a coefficient which should be determined
experimentally. When embedding this low energy theory of gravity into
candidates for its ultraviolet completion, we find that the proposed
relationship is guaranteed in string-inspired supergravity models with modulus
stabilisation and supersymmetry breaking leading to de Sitter
compactifications. In this case, the scalar degree of freedom of ${\cal R}^2$
gravity is associated to a volume modulus. Once written in terms of a
scalar-tensor theory, the effective theory corresponds to a massive scalar
field coupled with the universal strength $\beta=1/\sqrt{6}$ to the matter
stress-energy tensor. When the relationship $c_0\lambda^2\simeq 1$ is realised
we find that on astrophysical scales and in cosmology the scalar field is
ultralocal and therefore no effect arises on such large scales. On the other
hand, the scalar field mass is tightly constrained by the non-observation of
fifth forces in torsion pendulum experiments such as E\""ot-Wash. It turns out
that the observation of the dark energy scale in cosmology implies that the
scalar field could be detectable by fifth force experiments in the near future.

in which the input is a graph $G$ and a spanning tree $T$ for it, and the goal
is to augment $T$ with a minimum set of edges $Aug$ from $G$, such that $T \cup
Aug$ is 2-edge-connected.
  TAP has been widely studied in the sequential setting. The best known
approximation ratio of 2 for the weighted case dates back to the work of
Frederickson and J\'{a}J\'{a}, SICOMP 1981. Recently, a 3/2-approximation was
given for unweighted TAP by Kortsarz and Nutov, TALG 2016. Recent breakthroughs
give an approximation of 1.458 for unweighted TAP [Grandoni et al., STOC 2018],
and approximations better than 2 for bounded weights [Adjiashvili, SODA 2017;
Fiorini et al., SODA 2018].
  In this paper, we provide the first fast distributed approximations for TAP.
We present a distributed $2$-approximation for weighted TAP which completes in
$O(h)$ rounds, where $h$ is the height of $T$. When $h$ is large, we show a
much faster 4-approximation algorithm for the unweighted case, completing in
$O(D+\sqrt{n}\log^*{n})$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $D$ is
the diameter of $G$.
  Immediate consequences of our results are an $O(D)$-round 2-approximation
algorithm for the minimum size 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph, which
significantly improves upon the running time of previous approximation
algorithms, and an $O(h_{MST}+\sqrt{n}\log^{*}{n})$-round 3-approximation
algorithm for the weighted case, where $h_{MST}$ is the height of the MST of
the graph. Additional applications are algorithms for verifying
2-edge-connectivity and for augmenting the connectivity of any connected
spanning subgraph to 2.
  Finally, we complement our study with proving lower bounds for distributed
approximations of TAP.

the isomonodromic system in terms of an appropriate Riemann-Hilbert boundary
value problem, we can pass to the limit $n\to\infty$ (at a formal level) and
identify an isomonodromic system in terms of the Miwa variables, which play the
role of times of the KP hierarchy. This allows to derive the String and Dilaton
equations via a purely Riemann-Hilbert approach.
  The expression of the formal limit of the partition function as an
isomonodromic tau function allows us to derive explicit closed formul\ae\ for
the correlators of this matrix model in terms of the solution of the
Riemann-Hilbert problem with all times set to zero. These correlators have been
conjectured to describe the intersection numbers for Riemann surfaces with
boundaries, or open intersection numbers.

domain by leveraging knowledge from a related source domain with plenty of
labeled data. Often times we may have multiple domains with little or no
labeled data as targets waiting to be solved. Most existing efforts tackle
target domains separately by modeling the `source-target' pairs without
exploring the relatedness between them, which would cause loss of crucial
information, thus failing to achieve optimal capability of knowledge transfer.
In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach called Multi-Relevance
Transfer Learning (MRTL) for this purpose, which can simultaneously transfer
different knowledge from the source and exploits the shared common latent
factors between target domains. Specifically, we formulate the problem as an
optimization task based on a collective nonnegative matrix tri-factorization
framework. The proposed approach achieves both source-target transfer and
target-target leveraging by sharing multiple decomposed latent subspaces.
Further, an alternative minimization learning algorithm is developed with
convergence guarantee. Empirical study validates the performance and
effectiveness of MRTL compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

encoding ladders in adaptive streaming systems to achieve cost-optimal and
immersive streaming experiences. In this context, this paper targets both the
provider's and client's perspectives and introduces a new content-aware
encoding ladder estimation method for tiled 360{\deg} VR video in adaptive
streaming systems. The proposed method first categories a given 360{\deg} video
using its features of encoding complexity and estimates the visual distortion
and resource cost of each bitrate level based on the proposed distortion and
resource cost models. An optimal encoding ladder is then formed using the
proposed integer linear programming (ILP) algorithm by considering practical
constraints. Experimental results of the proposed method are compared with the
recommended encoding ladders of professional streaming service providers.
Evaluations show that the proposed encoding ladders deliver better results
compared to the recommended encoding ladders in terms of objective quality for
360{\deg} video, providing optimal encoding ladders using a set of service

string-replace function (even the most restricted version where
pattern/replacement strings are both constant strings) becomes undecidable if
we do not impose some kind of straight-line (aka acyclicity) restriction on the
formulas. Despite this, the straight-line restriction is still practically
sensible since this condition is typically met by string constraints that are
generated by symbolic execution. In this paper, we provide the first systematic
study of straight-line string constraints with the string-replace function and
the regular constraints as the basic operations. We show that a large class of
such constraints (i.e. when only a constant string or a regular expression is
permitted in the pattern) is decidable. We note that the string-replace
function, even under this restriction, is sufficiently powerful for expressing
the concatenation operator and much more (e.g. extensions of regular
expressions with string variables). This gives us the most expressive decidable
logic containing concatenation, replace, and regular constraints under the same
umbrella. Our decision procedure for the straight-line fragment follows an
automata-theoretic approach, and is modular in the sense that the
string-replace terms are removed one by one to generate more and more regular
constraints, which can then be discharged by the state-of-the-art string
constraint solvers. We also show that this fragment is, in a way, a maximal
decidable subclass of the straight-line fragment with string-replace and
regular constraints. To this end, we show undecidability results for the
following two extensions: (1) variables are permitted in the pattern parameter
of the replace function, (2) length constraints are permitted.

the multiantenna multicasting opportunities provided by the CC technique while
optimally balancing the detrimental impact of both noise and inter-stream

views in a multi-camera system, and re-id has been an important technology
applied in smart city in recent years. However, the majority of existing person
re-id methods are not designed for processing sequential data in an online way.
This ignores the real-world scenario that person images detected from

discussing online re-id, most of them require considerable storage of all
passed data samples that have been ever observed, and this could be unrealistic
for processing data from a large camera network. In this work, we present an
onepass person re-id model that adapts the re-id model based on each newly
observed data and no passed data are directly used for each update. More
specifically, we develop an Sketch online Discriminant Analysis (SoDA) by
embedding sketch processing into Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). SoDA can
efficiently keep the main data variations of all passed samples in a low rank
matrix when processing sequential data samples, and estimate the approximate
within-class variance (i.e. within-class covariance matrix) from the sketch
data information. We provide theoretical analysis on the effect of the
estimated approximate within-class covariance matrix. In particular, we derive
upper and lower bounds on the Fisher discriminant score (i.e. the quotient
between between-class variation and within-class variation after feature
transformation) in order to investigate how the optimal feature transformation
learned by SoDA sequentially approximates the offline FDA that is learned on
all observed data. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness
of our SoDA and empirically support our theoretical analysis.

there is no existing ATE methods that can consistently outperform others in any

searching for such a 'one-size-fit-all' solution that may never exist, we
propose to develop generic methods to 'enhance' existing ATE methods. We
introduce SemRe-Rank, the first method based on this principle, to incorporate
semantic relatedness - an often overlooked venue - into an existing ATE method
to further improve its performance. SemRe-Rank incorporates word embeddings
into a personalised PageRank process to compute 'semantic importance' scores
for candidate terms from a graph of semantically related words (nodes), which
are then used to revise the scores of candidate terms computed by a base ATE

improvement over all base methods and across all datasets, with up to 15

measured at a K that equals to the expected real terms in the candidates (F1 in
short). Compared to an alternative approach built on the well-known TextRank
algorithm, SemRe-Rank can potentially outperform by up to 8 points in Precision

system for conversational information access. A common practice in current
dialog systems is to define the dialog state by a set of slot-value pairs. Such
representation of dialog states and the slot-filling based DST have been widely
employed, but suffer from three drawbacks. (1) The dialog state can contain
only a single value for a slot, and (2) can contain only users' affirmative
preference over the values for a slot. (3) Current task-based dialog systems
mainly focus on the searching task, while the enquiring task is also very
common in practice. The above observations motivate us to enrich current
representation of dialog states and collect a brand new dialog dataset about
movies, based upon which we build a new DST, called enriched DST (EDST), for
flexible accessing movie information. The EDST supports the searching task, the
enquiring task and their mixed task. We show that the new EDST method not only
achieves good results on Iqiyi dataset, but also outperforms other
state-of-the-art DST methods on the traditional dialog datasets, WOZ2.0 and

  seismic assessment of urban areas","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The analysis of the seismic vulnerability of urban centres has received a
great attention in the last century. In order to estimate the seismic
vulnerability of a densely populated urban area, it would in principle be
necessary to develop in-depth analyses for predicting the dynamic behaviour of
the individual buildings and their structural aggregation. Such analyses,
however, are extremely cost-intensive, require great processing time and above
all expertise judgement. It is therefore very useful to define simplified rules
for estimating the seismic vulnerability of whole urban areas. In the last
decades, the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) scenario has gained increasing
credibility as a mathematical framework for explaining a large number of
naturally occurring extreme events, from avalanches to earthquakes dynamics,
from bubbles and crises in financial markets to the extinction of species in
the evolution or the behaviour of human brain activity. All these examples show
the intrinsic tendency common to many phenomena to spontaneously organize into
a dynamical critical state, whose signature is the presence of a power law
behaviour in the frequency distribution of events. In this context, the
Olami-Feder- Christensen (OFC) model, introduced in 1992, has played a key role
in modelling earthquakes phenomenology. The aim of the present paper is
proposing an agent-based model of earthquake dynamics, based on the OFC self-
organized criticality framework, in order to evaluate the effects of a critical
sequence of seismic events on a given large urban area during a given interval
of time. The further integration of a GIS database within a software
environment for agent-based simulations, will allow to perform a preliminary
parametric study of these effects on real datasets. The model could be useful
for defining planning strategies for seismic risk reduction

study the heat kernel and the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace. First, we
investigate hyperbolic polygons, i.e. relatively compact domains in the
hyperbolic plane with piecewise geodesic boundary. We compute the asymptotic
expansion of the heat trace associated to the Dirichlet Laplacian of any
hyperbolic polygon, and we obtain explicit formulas for all heat invariants.
Analogous results for Euclidean and spherical polygons were known before. We
unify these results and deduce the heat invariants for arbitrary polygons, i.e.
for relatively compact domains with piecewise geodesic boundary contained in a
complete Riemannian manifold of constant Gaussian curvature. It turns out that
the heat invariants provide much information about a polygon, if the curvature
does not vanish. For example, then the multiset of all real angles (i.e. those
which are not equal to pi) and the Euler characteristic of a polygon are
spectral invariants. Furthermore, we compute the asymptotic expansion of the
heat trace for any closed Riemannian orbisurface of constant curvature, and
obtain explicit formulas for all heat invariants. If the curvature does not
vanish, then it is possible to detect interesting information about the
topology and the singular set of an orbisurface from the heat invariants.

rapidly through the instability strip after leaving the Asymptotic Giant
Branch. Their light variability is dominated by radial pulsations. Members of
the RVb subclass show an additional variability in form of a long-term
modulation of the mean brightness, for which the most popular theories all
assume binarity and some kind of circumstellar dust. Here we address if the
amplitude modulations are consistent with the dust obscuration model. Aims. We
measure and interpret the overall changes of the mean amplitude of the
pulsations along the RVb variability. Methods. We compiled long-term
photometric data for RVb-type stars, including visual observations of the
American Association of Variable Star Observers, ground-based CCD photometry
from the OGLE and ASAS projects and ultra-precise space photometry of one star,
DF Cygni, from the Kepler space telescope. After converting all the
observations to flux units, we measure the cycle-to-cycle variations of the
pulsation amplitude and correlate them to the actual mean fluxes. Results. We
find a surprisingly uniform correlation between the pulsation amplitude and the
mean flux: they scale linearly with each other for a wide range of fluxes and
amplitudes. It means that the pulsation amplitude actually remains constant
when measured relative to the system flux level. The apparent amplitude
decrease in the faint states has long been noted in the literature but it was
always claimed to be difficult to explain with the actual models of the RVb
phenomenon. Here we show that when fluxes are used instead of magnitudes, the
amplitude attenuation is naturally explained by periodic obscuration from a
large opaque screen, one most likely corresponding to a circumbinary dusty disk
that surrounds the whole system.

which is fully populated by agents playing both the Prisoner's Dilemma or the
Optional Prisoner's Dilemma games with coevolutionary rules, i.e., not only the
strategies but also the link weights evolve over time. Surprisingly, results
show that the heterogeneity of link weights (states) on their own does not

increase in the number of overlapping states and not by the heterogeneity
itself. We believe that these results can guide further research towards a more

systems with strongly delayed connections. We obtain strict conditions for
synchronization of periodic and equilibrium solutions. In particular, we show
the existence of a critical coupling strength $\kappa_{c}$, depending only on
the network structure, isolated dynamics and coupling function, such that for
large delay and coupling strength $\kappa<\kappa_{c}$, the network possesses
stable synchronization. The critical coupling $\kappa_{c}$ can be chosen
independently of the delay for the case of equilibria, while for the periodic
solution, $\kappa_{c}$ depends essentially on the delay and vanishes as the
delay increases. We observe that, for random networks, the synchronization
interval is maximal when the network is close to the connectivity threshold. We
also derive scaling of the coupling parameter that allows for a synchronization
of large networks for different network topologies.

for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) scales linearly with the number of clusters
$C$, data points $N$, and data dimensionality $D$. In this study, we explore
whether one iteration of $k$-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with
$C$ at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective.
The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is
typically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many
hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated
variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The
basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ required for a full E-step to a sublinear
complexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on $C$ can be
reduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter $G$ which relates to
cluster neighborhood relations. We focus on two versions of partial variational
EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with $\mathcal{O}(NG^2D)$, and
variational $k$-means, scaling with $\mathcal{O}(NGD)$ per iteration. Empirical
results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of
iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as $k$-means. For
data with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of net
computational demands between two and three orders of magnitude. More
generally, our results provide substantial empirical evidence in favor of
clustering to scale sublinearly with $C$.

correlated low-dimensional magnetism, or of a widely tunable band gap, is
determined by the boundary conditions imposed by the width, crystallographic

model for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation proposed in \cite{2017_Otomo}. This
improvement is achieved by controlling the relaxation time, modifying the
equilibrium state, and employing more and higher lattice speeds, in a manner
suggested by our analysis of the Taylor-series expansion method. The model's
enhanced stability enables us to use larger time increments, thereby more than
compensating for the extra computation required by the high lattice speeds.
Furthermore, even though the time increments are larger than those of the
previous scheme, the same level of accuracy is maintained because of the
smaller truncation error of the new scheme. As a result, total performance with
the new scheme on the D1Q7 lattice is improved by 92 $\%$ compared to the
original scheme on the D1Q5 lattice.

emerged as an active area of research. In bilingual communities, the speakers
commonly embed the words and phrases of a non-native language into the syntax
of a native language in their day-to-day communications. The code-switching is
a global phenomenon among multilingual communities, still very limited acoustic
and linguistic resources are available as yet. For developing effective speech
based applications, the ability of the existing language technologies to deal
with the code-switched data can not be over emphasized. The code-switching is
broadly classified into two modes: inter-sentential and intra-sentential
code-switching. In this work, we have studied the intra-sentential problem in
the context of code-switching language modeling task. The salient contributions
of this paper includes: (i) the creation of Hindi-English code-switching text
corpus by crawling a few blogging sites educating about the usage of the
Internet (ii) the exploration of the parts-of-speech features towards more
effective modeling of Hindi-English code-switched data by the monolingual
language model (LM) trained on native (Hindi) language data, and (iii) the
proposal of a novel textual factor referred to as the code-switch factor
(CS-factor), which allows the LM to predict the code-switching instances. In
the context of recognition of the code-switching data, the substantial
reduction in the PPL is achieved with the use of POS factors and also the
proposed CS-factor provides independent as well as additive gain in the PPL.

measurements of these parameters exist and only at relatively low velocities.
This manuscript presents the measurement of the velocity and pointing errors at
rotation frequencies up to 5 kHz. The acquired data allows to identify the
rotor drive as the main source of velocity variations with fast fluctuations of
up to 3.4 ns (RMS) and slow drifts of 23 ns (RMS) over ~120 revolutions at 5
kHz in vacuum. At the same rotation frequency the pointing fluctuated by 12
$\mu$rad (RMS) and 33 $\mu$rad (peak-to-peak) over ~10000 roundtrips. To our
best knowledge this states the first measurement of velocity and pointing
errors at multi-kHz rotation frequencies and will allow potential adopters to
evaluate the feasibility of such rotor drives for their application.

intelligent agents want to be able to \emph{trust} such agents -- that is, to
know that these agents will perform correctly, to understand the reasoning
behind their actions, and to know how to use them appropriately. Many
techniques have been devised to assess and influence human trust in
artificially intelligent agents. However, these approaches are typically ad
hoc, and have not been formally related to each other or to formal trust
models. This paper presents a survey of \emph{algorithmic assurances}, i.e.
programmed components of agent operation that are expressly designed to
calibrate user trust in artificially intelligent agents. Algorithmic assurances
are first formally defined and classified from the perspective of formally
modeled human-artificially intelligent agent trust relationships. Building on
these definitions, a synthesis of research across communities such as machine
learning, human-computer interaction, robotics, e-commerce, and others reveals
that assurance algorithms naturally fall along a spectrum in terms of their
impact on an agent's core functionality, with seven notable classes ranging
from integral assurances (which impact an agent's core functionality) to
supplemental assurances (which have no direct effect on agent performance).
Common approaches within each of these classes are identified and discussed;
benefits and drawbacks of different approaches are also investigated.

observations in a noisy environment. In such an environment the noise source
might evolve, causing the stationary models to fail. Therefore a
heteroscedastic Gaussian noise model is introduced where the variance can vary
across observations and sensors. The source amplitudes are assumed independent
zero-mean complex Gaussian distributed with unknown variances (i.e. the source
powers), inspiring stochastic maximum likelihood DOA estimation. The DOAs of
plane waves are estimated from multi-snapshot sensor array data using sparse
Bayesian learning (SBL) where the noise is estimated across both sensors and
snapshots. This SBL approach is more flexible and performs better than
high-resolution methods since they cannot estimate the heteroscedastic noise
process. An alternative to SBL is simple data normalization, whereby only the
phase across the array is utilized. Simulations demonstrate that taking the
heteroscedastic noise into account improves DOA estimation.

respectively the adjacency matrix and the degree matrix of $G$. Define $$
A_{\alpha}(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G) $$ for any real $\alpha\in [0,1]$. The
$A_{\alpha}$-characteristic polynomial of $G$ is defined to be $$
\det(xI_n-A_{\alpha}(G))=\sum_jc_{\alpha j}(G)x^{n-j}, $$ where $\det(*)$

The $A_{\alpha}$-spectrum of $G$ consists of all roots of the

determined by its $A_{\alpha}$-spectrum if all graphs having the same
$A_{\alpha}$-spectrum as $G$ are isomorphic to $G$.

$A_{\alpha}$-characteristic polynomial of $G$. And then, we observe that
$A_{\alpha}$-spectra are much efficient for us to distinguish graphs, by
enumerating the $A_{\alpha}$-characteristic polynomials for all graphs on at
most 10 vertices. To verify this observation, we characterize some graphs
determined by their $A_{\alpha}$-spectra.

multimodal representation models of movies, based on textual information from

the textual domain, we emphasize our research in topic modeling of movies based
on their subtitles, in order to extract topics that discriminate between
movies. Regarding the visual domain, we focus on the extraction of semantically
useful features that model camera movements, colors and faces, while for the
audio domain we adopt simple classification aggregates based on pretrained
models. The three domains are combined with static metadata (e.g. directors,
actors) to prove that the content-based movie similarity procedure can be
enhanced with low-level multimodal information. In order to demonstrate the
proposed content representation approach, we have built a small dataset of 160
widely known movies. We assert movie similarities, as propagated by the
individual modalities and fusion models, in the form of recommendation
rankings. Extensive experimentation proves that all three low-level modalities
(text, audio and visual) boost the performance of a content-based
recommendation system, compared to the typical metadata-based content
representation, by more than $50\%$ relative increase. To our knowledge, this
is the first approach that utilizes a wide range of features from all involved

However, its shortcomings, including mode mixing and end effects, are as

disadvantages is presented in this paper. The proposal first removes dynamic DC
components in signals using empirical mode decomposition. Then an EKF model is

to generalized Lorentz gauge conditions for the electric and magnetic charge of

two additional planets subject to final verification. In our studies, we
consider comets of different inclinations and eccentricities and find an array
of different outcomes such as encounters with planets, captures, and escapes.
Comets with relatively large eccentricities are able to enter the inner region
of the system facing early planetary encounters. Stable comets experience
long-term evolution of orbital elements, as expected. We also tried to
distinguish cometary families akin to our Solar System but no clear distinction
between possible families was found. Generally, theoretical and observational
