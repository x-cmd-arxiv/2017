at each information set of the game. We use an instantiation of the CFR
framework to develop algorithms for solving behaviorally-constrained (and, as a
special case, perturbed in the Selten sense) extensive-form games, which allows
us to compute approximate Nash equilibrium refinements. Nash equilibrium
refinements are motivated by a major deficiency in Nash equilibrium: it
provides virtually no guarantees on how it will play in parts of the game tree
that are reached with zero probability. Refinements can mend this issue, but
have not been adopted in practice, mostly due to a lack of scalable algorithms.
We show that, compared to standard algorithms, our method finds solutions that
have substantially better refinement properties, while enjoying a convergence
rate that is comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms for Nash
equilibrium computation both in theory and practice.

equations (PDEs) with explicit time-stepping schemes, such as strong
stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK), suffer from time-step restrictions
that are significantly worse than what a simple Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
argument requires. In particular, the maximum stable time-step scales inversely
with the highest degree in the DG polynomial approximation space and becomes
progressively smaller with each added spatial dimension. In this work we
introduce a novel approach that we have dubbed the regionally implicit
discontinuous Galerkin (RIDG) method to overcome these small time-step
restrictions. The RIDG method is based on an extension of the Lax-Wendroff DG
(LxW-DG) method, which previously had been shown to be equivalent to a
predictor-corrector approach, where the predictor is a locally implicit
spacetime method (i.e., the predictor is something like a block-Jacobi update
for a fully implicit spacetime DG method). The corrector is an explicit method
that uses the spacetime reconstructed solution from the predictor step. In this
work we modify the predictor to include not just local information, but also
neighboring information. With this modification we show that the stability is
greatly enhanced; in particular, we show that we are able to remove the
polynomial degree dependence of the maximum time-step and show how this extends
to multiple spatial dimensions. A semi-analytic von Neumann analysis is
presented to theoretically justify the stability claims. Convergence and
efficiency studies for linear and nonlinear problems in multiple dimensions are
accomplished using a MATLAB code that can be freely downloaded.

In Max Cal, you maximize a path entropy over all possible pathways, subject to
dynamical constraints, in order to predict relative path weights. Many
well-known relationships of Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics -- such as the
Green-Kubo fluctuation-dissipation relations, Onsager's reciprocal relations,
and Prigogine's Minimum Entropy Production -- are limited to near-equilibrium
processes. Max Cal is more general. While it can readily derive these results
under those limits, Max Cal is also applicable far from equilibrium. We give
recent examples of MaxCal as a method of inference about trajectory
distributions from limited data, finding reaction coordinates in bio-molecular
simulations, and modeling the complex dynamics of non-thermal systems such as
gene regulatory networks or the collective firing of neurons. We also survey
its basis in principle, and some limitations.

that the Planck concordance model is in tension with the HII data at more than
2.5 sigma, while R_h=ct agrees with the GP reconstruction very well,

to advances in radioastronomy, and very recently the presence of urea was also
suggested. While those molecules were observed, it is not clear what the
mechanisms responsible to their formation are. In fact, if gas-phase reactions
are responsible, they should occur through barrierless mechanisms (or with very
low barriers). In the past, mechanisms for the formation of different organic
molecules were studied, providing only in a few cases energetic conditions
favorable to a synthesis at very low temperature. A particularly intriguing
class of such molecules are those containing one N--C--O peptide bond, which
could be a building block for the formation of biological molecules. Urea is a
particular case because two nitrogen atoms are linked to the C--O moiety. Thus,
motivated also by the recent tentative observation of urea, we have considered
the synthetic pathways responsible to its formation.
  We have studied the possibility of forming urea in the gas phase via
different kinds of bi-molecular reactions: ion-molecule, neutral, and radical.
In particular we have focused on the activation energy of these reactions in
order to find possible reactants that could be responsible for to barrierless
(or very low energy) pathways.
  We have used very accurate, highly correlated quantum chemistry calculations
to locate and characterize the reaction pathways in terms of minima and
transition states connecting reactants to products.
  Most of the reactions considered have an activation energy that is too high;
but the ion-molecule reaction between NH$_2$OH$_2^+$ and formamide is not too
high. These reactants could be responsible not only for the formation of urea
but also of isocyanic acid, which is an organic molecule also observed in the

transit light curves. Refraction thus provides an avenue to probe physical
properties of exoplanet atmospheres and to constrain the presence of clouds and
hazes. In addition, an effective surface can be imposed by refraction, thereby
limiting the pressure levels probed by transmission spectroscopy. The main
objective of the paper is to model the effects of refraction on photometric
light curves for realistic planets and to explore the dependencies on
atmospheric physical parameters. We also explore under which circumstances
transmission spectra are significantly affected by refraction. Finally, we
search for refraction signatures in photometric residuals in Kepler data. We
use the model of Hui & Seager (2002) to compute deflection angles and
refraction transit light curves, allowing us to explore the parameter space of
atmospheric properties. The observational search is performed by stacking large
samples of transit light curves from Kepler. We find that out-of-transit
refraction shoulders are the most easily observable features, which can reach
peak amplitudes of ~10 parts per million (ppm) for planets around Sun-like
stars. More typical amplitudes are a few ppm or less for Jovians and at the
sub-ppm level for super-Earths. Interestingly, the signal-to-noise ratio of any
refraction residuals for planets orbiting Sun-like hosts are expected to be
similar for planets orbiting red dwarfs. We also find that the maximum depth
probed by transmission spectroscopy is not limited by refraction for weakly
lensing planets, but that the incidence of refraction can vary significantly
for strongly lensing planets. We find no signs of refraction features in the
stacked Kepler light curves, which is in agreement with our model predictions.

  Squares","Master Thesis",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A proper vertex coloring of a graph is a mapping of its vertices on a set of
colors, such that two adjacent vertices are not mapped to the same color. This
constraint may be interpreted in terms of the distance between to vertices and
so a more general coloring concept can be defined: The strong coloring of a
graph. So a k-strong coloring is a coloring where two vertices may not have the
same color if their distance to each other is at most k. The 2-strong coloring
of the line graph is known as the strong edge coloring. Coloring the kth power
G^k of a graph G is the same as finding a k-strong coloring of G itself. In
order to obtain a graph class on which the 2-strong coloring becomes
efficiently solvable we are looking for a structure that produces induced
cycles in the square of G, so that by excluding this structure we obtain a
graph class with chordal squares, where a chordal graph is a graph without any
induced cycles of length at least 4. Such a structure is called a flower.
Another structure will be found and explained, which is responsible for flowers
to appear in the line graph of G: The sprouts. With this graphs with chordal
line graph squares are described as well. Some attempts in generalizing those
structures to obtain perfect graph squares are being made and the general
concept of chordal graph powers, i.e. the existence of a smallest power for
which a graph becomes chordal, the power of chordality is introduced in order
to solve some coloring related NP-hard problems on graphs with parameterized
algorithms. Some connections to the famous parameter treewidth arise alongside
with some deeper connections between edge and vertex coloring.

materials is a preeminent challenge, particularly in electrochemical energy
storage. Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals exemplify a diverse family of
materials that permit ions to reversibly associate with a host atomic lattice
by intercalation into interlamellar gaps. Motivated principally by the search
for high-capacity battery anodes, ion intercalation in composite materials is a
subject of intense study. Yet the precise role and ability of heterolayers to
modify intercalation reactions remains elusive. Previous studies of vdW hybrids
represented ensemble measurements at macroscopic films/powders, which do not
permit the isolation and investigation of the chemistry at individual
2-dimensional (2D) interfaces. Here, we demonstrate the intercalation of
lithium at the level of individual atomic interfaces of dissimilar vdW layers.
Electrochemical devices based on vdW heterostructures comprised of
deterministically stacked hexagonal boron nitride, graphene (G) and molybdenum
dichalcogenide (MoX2; X = S, Se) layers are fabricated, enabling the direct
resolution of intermediate stages in the intercalation of discrete
heterointerfaces and the extent of charge transfer to individual layers.
Operando magnetoresistance and optical spectroscopy coupled with
low-temperature quantum magneto-oscillation measurements show that the creation
of intimate vdW heterointerfaces between G and MoX2 engenders over 10-fold
accumulation of charge in MoX2 compared to MoX2/MoX2 homointerfaces, while
enforcing a more negative intercalation potential than that of bulk MoX2 by at
least 0.5 V. Beyond energy storage, our new combined experimental and
computational methodology to manipulate and characterize the electrochemical
behavior of layered systems opens up new pathways to control the charge density

edges to their neighbors at a cost of a fixed parameter $\alpha$. The cost of a
player is defined to be the cost of the bought edges plus the sum of distances
to all the players in the resulting graph.
  We identify and characterize various structural properties of strong
equilibria, which lead to a characterization of the set of strong equilibria
for all $\alpha$ in the range $(0,2)$. For $\alpha > 2$, Andelman et al. (2009)
prove that a star graph in which every leaf buys one edge to the center node is
a strong equilibrium, and conjecture that in fact any star is a strong
equilibrium. We resolve this conjecture in the affirmative. Additionally, we
show that when $\alpha$ is large enough ($\geq 2n$) there exist non-star trees
that are strong equilibria. For the strong price of anarchy, we provide precise
expressions when $\alpha$ is in the range $(0,2)$, and we prove a lower bound
of $3/2$ when $\alpha \geq 2$.
  Lastly, we aim to characterize under which conditions (coalitional)
improvement dynamics may converge to a strong equilibrium. To this end, we
study the (coalitional) finite improvement property and (coalitional) weak
acyclicity property. We prove various conditions under which these properties
do and do not hold. Some of these results also hold for the class of pure Nash
equilibria.

problem, whose solution is used to guide future investment in transmission

the semidefinite relaxation of the AC optimal power flow problem (ACOPF); its
computational engine is a new specialized branch-and-cut algorithm for
transmission expansion planning to deal with the underlying mixed-integer ACOPF
problem. Valid inequalities that are based on specific knowledge of the
expansion problem are employed to improve the solution quality at any node of
the search tree, and thus significantly reduce the overall computational effort
of the branch-and-bound algorithm. Additionally, sparsity of the semidefinite
relaxation is exploited to further reduce the computation time at each node of
the branch-and-cut tree. Despite the vast number of publications on
transmission expansion planning, the proposed approach is the first to provide
expansion plans that are globally optimal using a solution approach for the
mixed-integer ACOPF problem. The results on standard networks serve as
important benchmarks to assess the solution quality from existing techniques

this theorem to recover the known results on categories of slices to date, and
exhibit the utility of our description in several new examples. We go further
and show that the Green functors $\underline{[W,W]}$ for certain slice

a polaron. Numerous methods have been developed to calculate how the energy and
the effective mass of the polaron are renormalized by the medium for
equilibrium situations. Here we address the much less studied non-equilibrium
regime and investigate how polarons form dynamically in time. To this end, we
develop a time-dependent renormalization group approach which allows
calculations of all dynamical properties of the system and takes into account
the effects of quantum fluctuations in the polaron cloud. We apply this method
to calculate trajectories of polarons following a sudden quench of the
impurity-boson interaction strength, revealing how the polaronic cloud around
the impurity forms in time. Such trajectories provide additional information
about the polaron's properties which are challenging to extract directly from
the spectral function measured experimentally using ultracold atoms. At strong
couplings, our calculations predict the appearance of trajectories where the
impurity wavers back at intermediate times as a result of quantum fluctuations.
Our method is applicable to a broader class of non-equilibrium problems. We
also apply it to calculate the spectral function and find good agreement with
experimental results. At very strong couplings, we predict that quantum
fluctuations lead to the appearance of a dark continuum with strongly
suppressed spectral weight at low energies. While our calculations start from
an effective Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian describing impurities in a
three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, we also calculate the effects of
additional terms in the Hamiltonian beyond the Fr\""ohlich paradigm. We
demonstrate that the main effect of these additional terms on the attractive

significant role in both physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds.
This energy and momentum leaves an identifiable signature (""bubbles"") that
affect the dynamics and structure of the cloud. Most bubble searches are
performed ""by-eye"", which are usually time-consuming, subjective and difficult
to calibrate. Automatic classifications based on machine learning make it
possible to perform systematic, quantifiable and repeatable searches for
bubbles. We employ a previously developed machine learning algorithm, Brut, and
quantitatively evaluate its performance in identifying bubbles using synthetic
dust observations. We adopt magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, which model
stellar winds launching within turbulent molecular clouds, as an input to
generate synthetic images. We use a publicly available three-dimensional dust
continuum Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, hyperion, to generate synthetic
images of bubbles in three Spitzer bands (4.5 um, 8 um and 24 um). We designate
half of our synthetic bubbles as a training set, which we use to train Brut
along with citizen-science data from the Milky Way Project. We then assess
Brut's accuracy using the remaining synthetic observations. We find that after
retraining Brut's performance increases significantly, and it is able to
identify yellow bubbles, which are likely associated with B-type stars. Brut
continues to perform well on previously identified high-score bubbles, and over
10% of the Milky Way Project bubbles are reclassified as high-confidence
bubbles, which were previously marginal or ambiguous detections in the Milky

superior to Chebyshev for kernel learning, and that a surrogate approach can be
highly efficient and accurate with popular kernels.

process is performed in the frame of the Kane model that provides the most
adequate description of the real energy spectra and wave functions of III-V

analyze the energy transfer rate both in the weak-interaction approximation and
in the strong-interaction approximation. For the first time the detailed
analytical calculations of the exchange energy transfer rate for the quantum

transfer rate are derived. The numerical calculations showed that at nearly
contact distances between two quantum dots the rate of the energy transfer due
to the direct Coulomb interaction as well as by exchange interaction can reach
the saturation. At the small distances, these two contributions can be of the

concentration models, in which small pebbles are concentrated locally and then
collapse gravitationally to form planetesimals. Both types of models make
certain predictions for the size spectrum and internal structure of newly-born
planetesimals. We use these predictions as input to simulate collisional
evolution of debris discs left after the gas dispersal. The debris disc
emission as a function of a system's age computed in these simulations is
compared with several Spitzer and Herschel debris disc surveys around A-type
stars. We confirm that the observed brightness evolution for the majority of
discs can be reproduced by classical models. Further, we find that it is
equally consistent with the size distribution of planetesimals predicted by
particle concentration models - provided the objects are loosely bound ""pebble
piles"" as these models also predict. Regardless of the assumed planetesimal
formation mechanism, explaining the brightest debris discs in the samples
uncovers a ""disc mass problem."" To reproduce such discs by collisional
simulations, a total mass of planetesimals of up to ~1000 Earth masses is
required, which exceeds the total mass of solids available in the
protoplanetary progenitors of debris discs. This may indicate that stirring was
delayed in some of the bright discs, that giant impacts occurred recently in
some of them, that some systems may be younger than previously thought, or that
non-collisional processes contribute significantly to the dust production.

to electrons, the SOI enables an additional, efficient spin-flipping interdot

performance enhancement? This article investigates the implications of
interference, densification and spectrum sharing in D2D performance gain. The
in-band D2D approach, where legacy users coexist with potential D2D pairs, is
considered in a multi-cell system. Overlay and underlay spectrum sharing
approaches are employed in order for the potential D2D pairs to access the
spectrum. Given that two of the most critical problems in the D2D concept are
mode selection and user scheduling, we jointly address them, aiming at
maximizing the total system uplink throughput. Thus, we present a radio

executed to evaluate the system performance and examine the trends of D2D

extremely anisotropic mechanical properties owing to orders of magnitude
difference between in-plane and out-of-plane interatomic interaction strengths.
Although effects of mechanical perturbations on either intra- or inter-layer
interactions have been extensively investigated, mutual correlations between
them have rarely been addressed. Here we show that layered materials have an
inevitable coupling between in-plane uniaxial strain and interlayer shear.
Because of this, the uniaxial in-plane strain induces an anomalous splitting of
the degenerate interlayer shear phonon modes such that the split shear mode
along the tensile strain is not softened but hardened contrary to the case of
intralayer phonon modes. We confirm the effect by measuring Raman shifts of
shear modes of bilayer MoS2 under strain. Moreover, by analyzing the splitting,
we obtain an unexplored off-diagonal elastic constant, demonstrating that Raman
spectroscopy can determine almost all mechanical constants of layered
materials.

bosonic fields in the vacuum state. The quadratic system Hamiltonian and the
linear system-field coupling operators, corresponding to a nominal open quantum
harmonic oscillator, are subject to perturbations represented in a Weyl
quantization form. Assuming that the nominal linear QSDE has a Hurwitz dynamics
matrix and using the Wigner-Moyal phase-space framework, we carry out an
infinitesimal perturbation analysis of the quasi-characteristic function for
the invariant quantum state of the nonlinear perturbed system. The resulting
correction of the invariant states in the spatial frequency domain may find
applications to their approximate computation, analysis of relaxation dynamics
and non-Gaussian state generation in nonlinear quantum stochastic systems.

the speed at which they process information is of value in understanding the
pricing discovery process. Using price discovery measures, including Putnins
(2013) information leadership share and intraday data, we quantify the
proportional contribution of price discovery between nearby and deferred
contracts in the corn and live cattle futures markets. Price discovery is more
systematic in the corn than in the live cattle market. On average, nearby
contracts lead all deferred contracts in price discovery in the corn market,
but have a relatively less dominant role in the live cattle market. In both
markets, the nearby contract loses dominance when its relative volume share
dips below 50%, which occurs about 2-3 weeks before expiration in corn and 5-6
weeks before expiration in live cattle. Regression results indicate that the
share of price discovery is most closely linked to trading volume but is also
affected, to far less degree, by time to expiration, backwardation, USDA
announcements and market crashes. The effects of these other factors vary
between the markets which likely reflect the difference in storability as well
as other market-related characteristics.

mechanism. The proffered model is fabricated with a combination of Type -I and
Type-II see-saw contributions of which the latter dominates. The scalars and
the leptons in the model are assigned $A4$ charges conducive to obtain the mass
matrices viable for the scheme. The Type -II see-saw mass matrix accommodates
atmospheric mass splitting and maximal mixing in the atmospheric sector
($\theta_{23}=\pi/4$). It is characterized by vanishing solar mass splitting
and $\theta_{13}$ whereas the third neutrino mixing angle is free to acquire
any value of $\theta_{12}^0$. Particular alternatives of $\theta_{12}^0$
corresponding to the popular lepton mixings viz. $\theta_{12}^0=35.3^\circ$
(tribimaximal), $45.0^\circ$ (bimaximal), $31.7^\circ$ (golden ratio) are
accounted for. Another choice of $\theta_{12}^0=0^\circ$ (no solar mixing) is
reckoned. The subdominant Type-I see-saw constituent of the model propels all
the neutrino oscillation parameters into the ranges allowed by the data which
in its turn get interrelated owing to their common origin. This makes the model
testable in the light of future experimental data. As an example, $\theta_{23}$
emerges in the first (second) octant for normal (inverted) ordering.
CP-violation is governed by phases present in the right-handed Majorana
neutrino mass matrix, $M_{\nu R}$. Only normal ordering is allowed if these
phases are absent. If $M_{\nu R}$ is complex the Dirac CP-violating phase
$\delta$, is capable of being large, i.e., $\sim \pm \pi/2$, and inverted
ordering of neutrino masses is also permitted. T2K and NOVA preliminary data
favouring normal ordering and $\delta \sim -\pi/2$ predicts lightest neutrino
mass to be 0.05 eV or more within the framework of this model.

the Henze-Penrose bounds on the pairwise Bayes misclassification rates that
rank the binary subproblems in terms of difficulty of classification. The
proposed empirical estimates of the Bayes error rate are computed from the

a meta-learning technique is presented for quantifying the one-vs-rest Bayes

Extensive simulations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hierarchical

functions concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical
trajectories. We introduce the notion of many-body quantum scars which reflect
the existence of a subset of special many-body eigenstates concentrated in

the Fibonacci chain -- the one- dimensional model with a constrained local
Hilbert space realized in the 51 Rydberg atom quantum simulator [H. Bernien et
al., arXiv:1707.04344]. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout
the thermalizing many-body spectrum, but surprisingly lead to direct
experimental signatures such as robust oscillations following a quench from a
charge-density wave state found in experiment. We develop a model based on a
single particle hopping on the Hilbert space graph, which quantitatively
captures the scarred wave functions up to large systems of L = 32 atoms. Our
results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality
class of quantum dynamics, which opens up opportunities for creating and
manipulating novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now
amenable to experimental study.

distributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition
disks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the
accumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can
form by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep
pressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap
or at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and
evolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of
two-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the
vortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is
nearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead
zone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the
two scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5
times larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular
cases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,
the vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation
mechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the
sub-millimeter continuum with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial
extent of brightness asymmetry correlates with vortex formation process, within
the limitations of alpha-viscosity prescription.

of dynamical BHs in large fields-of-view. This exploits the width of the disc
Halpha emission line, combined with orbital period information. We here show
that Halpha widths can be recovered using a combination of customized Halpha
filters. By setting a width cut-off at 2200 km/s we are able to cleanly remove
other Galactic populations of Halpha emitters, including ~99.9% of cataclysmic
variables (CVs). Only short period (Porb<2.1 h) eclipsing CVs and AGNs will
contaminate the sample but these can be easily flagged through photometric
variability and, in the latter case, also mid-IR colours. We also describe the
strategy of a deep (r=22) Galactic plane survey based on the concept of PMFs:
HAWKs, the HAlpha-Width Kilo-deg Survey. We estimate that ~800 sqr deg are
required to unveil ~50 new dynamical BHs, a three-fold improvement over the
known population. For comparison, a century would be needed to produce an
enlarged sample of 50 dynamical BHs from X-ray transients at the current
discovery rate.

the study of such systems. Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE,
an upgraded version of BSE (Hurley et al. 2002), to investigate the demography
of merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass
loss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the
electron-scattering Eddington factor on mass loss. We perform >10^8 simulations
of isolated massive binaries, with 12 different metallicities, to study the
impact of mass loss, core-collapse supernovae and common envelope on merging
BHBs. Accounting for the dependence of stellar winds on the Eddington factor
leads to the formation of black holes (BHs) with mass up to 65 Msun at
metallicity Z~0.0002. However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses <40 Msun.
We find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1 - 1.0 range, even if mass

topological phase transition at finite temperature. We show that a generalized
Kibble-Zurek scaling ansatz applies to this transition, in spite of the absence
of a local order parameter. We find perimeter-law scaling of the magnitude of a
non-local order parameter (defined using Wilson loops) and a dynamic exponent
$z=2.70 \pm 0.03$, the latter in good agreement with previous results for the
equilibrium dynamics (autocorrelations). We then study systems where
(topological) order forms only at zero temperature---the Ising chain, the
two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model, and a three-dimensional star model
(another variant of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model). In these systems the
correlation length diverges exponentially, in a way that is non-smooth as a
finite-size system approaches the zero temperature state. We show that the
Kibble-Zurek theory does not apply in any of these systems. Instead, the
dynamics can be understood in terms of diffusion and annihilation of
topological defects, which we use to formulate a scaling theory in good
agreement with our simulation results. We also discuss the effect of open
boundaries where defect annihilation competes with a faster process of
evaporation at the surface.

have not yet been detected and there is even ambiguity on whether the planet

simulations to study the morphology of spiral density waves launched by
embedded planets taking into account the vertical temperature gradient, a
natural consequence of stellar irradiation. Our simulations show that the pitch
angle of the spirals in thermally stratified discs is the lowest in the disc
mid-plane and increases towards the disc surface. We combine the hydrodynamic
simulations with 3D radiative transfer calculations to predict that the
pitch-angle of planetary spirals observed in the near-infrared is higher than

for extracting the two-sphere partition function of the string worldsheet

GLSMs that possess these partition functions in a large class of examples. In
these examples, the weak coupling regime of the four-dimensional theory is
mapped to the weak coupling regime of the worldsheet theory. In addition, we
study the classical string zero-modes in flat space and obtain predictions for
the worldsheet spectra, which agree with the low-energy spectra of the GLSMs
obtained in the localization analysis. For Nf=2Nc=4, we discuss the map between

tested as their desktop counterparts. In particular GUI testing is generally
limited. Like web-based applications, mobile apps suffer from GUI test
fragility, i.e. GUI test classes failing due to minor modifications in the GUI,
without the application functionalities being altered.
  Aims. The objective of our study is to examine the diffusion of GUI testing
on Android, and the amount of changes required to keep test classes up to date,
and in particular the changes due to GUI test fragility. We define metrics to
characterize the modifications and evolution of test classes and test methods,
and proxies to estimate fragility-induced changes.
  Method. To perform our experiments, we selected six widely used open-source
tools for scripted GUI testing of mobile applications previously described in
the literature. We have mined the repositories on GitHub that used those tools,
and computed our set of metrics.
  Results. We found that none of the considered GUI testing frameworks achieved
a major diffusion among the open-source Android projects available on GitHub.
For projects with GUI tests, we found that test suites have to be modified
often, specifically 5\%-10\% of developers' modified LOCs belong to tests, and
that a relevant portion (60\% on average) of such modifications are induced by
fragility.
  Conclusions. Fragility of GUI test classes constitute a relevant concern,
possibly being an obstacle for developers to adopt automated scripted GUI
tests. This first evaluation and measure of fragility of Android scripted GUI
testing can constitute a benchmark for developers, and the basis for the
definition of a taxonomy of fragility causes, and actionable guidelines to
mitigate the issue.

Many theoretical studies have predicted the anisotropic optical properties of

difficulties stem from the ease of BP's degradation when exposed to air in

approaches on ATLAS/CMS have largely focussed on a subset of the calorimeter,
and for identifying objects or particular particle types. We explore approaches
that use the entire calorimeter, combined with track information, for directly
conducting physics analyses: i.e. classifying events as known-physics
background or new-physics signals.
  We use an existing RPV-Supersymmetry analysis as a case study and explore
CNNs on multi-channel, high-resolution sparse images: applied on GPU and
multi-node CPU architectures (including Knights Landing (KNL) Xeon Phi nodes)
on the Cori supercomputer at NERSC.

of people and organizations, exhibit much diversity in both size and activity
level; some communities grow to a massive scale and thrive, whereas others
remain small, and even wither. In spite of the important role of these
proliferating communities, there is limited empirical evidence that identifies
the dominant factors underlying their dynamics. Using data collected from seven
large online platforms, we observe a universal relationship between online
community size and its activity: First, three distinct activity regimes exist,
one of low-activity and two of high-activity. Further, we find a sharp activity
phase transition at a critical community size that marks the shift between the
first and the second regime. Essentially, it is around this critical size that
sustainable interactive communities emerge. Finally, above a higher
characteristic size, community activity reaches and remains at a constant and
high level to form the third regime. We propose that the sharp activity phase
transition and the regime structure stem from the branching property of online
interactions. Branching results in the emergence of multiplicative growth of
the interactions above certain community sizes.

examined in phase space and it is parsed into distinct parts, properties of
ionic channels, properties of polarization channels, and two very narrow

conserving cable equation currents, namely capacitive, membrane, and total
ionic current are parsed into segments, pertaining to sodium and potassium
channels. Plots of ionic currents vs. potential exhibit quasilinear segments
yielding temperature dependent maximum conductance constants and the related
time rates. Plotting ionic time rates as Boltzmann kinetic rates yields
activation energies of the same order as the rate-limiting biochemical
metabolic reactions indicating that the passage of ions through the membrane is
mediated by biochemical reactions. Fractions of open channels are fitted in the
lab frame by modified Avrami (mAvrami) equations seeded with the value of the
Fine Structure Constant $\alpha$ = 0.0072973...(FSC). The steady propagation of
the action potential leads with its own excitation and provides insight into
nerve excitation in general. Evidence is presented that action potential
traverses a ferroelectric hysteresis loop. The heat released at 19.8 oC is
estimated to be twice as large as the heat released at 4.5 oC. It is expected
that presented results will provide the framework for further analysis of
biological excitability, ionic channels lattice structure, thermodynamic phase
changing behavior, and the role of quantum mechanics in biochemical reactions
mediating the flow of ions trough ionic channels. In particular, the critical
role of ferroelectric sodium channels lattice behavior has far reaching
implications for nerve excitability and encoding of memories.

optimized by vectorization over several cells and faces and an even-odd

implementation then reaches up to 60\% of arithmetic peak on Intel Haswell and
Broadwell processors and up to 50\% of arithmetic peak on Intel Knights

due to memory bandwidth limitations from loading the input and output vectors,
MPI ghost exchange, as well as handling variable coefficients and the geometry.
Our performance analysis shows that the results are often within 10\% of the

these galaxies are not representative of the evolving-disk population at z > 1.
We investigate the addition of pressure support, traced by intrinsic velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_{int}$) to the KDS dynamical mass budget by adopting a
'total' effective velocity of form $V_{tot} = (Vc^{2} +
4.0\sigma_{int}^{2})^{0.5}$. The rotation-dominated and dispersion-dominated
KDS galaxies fall on the same locus in the total-velocity versus stellar-mass
plane, removing the need for debate over the precise selection threshold for
rotation-dominated galaxies. The comparison sample offsets are in the range
+0.08 to +0.15 dex in total-velocity zero-point (-0.30 to -0.55 dex in
stellar-mass zero-point) from the local Tully-Fisher relation at z > 1,
consistent with steady evolution of the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass with
cosmic time.

stringent no unmeasured confounding assumptions which often fail to hold in
practice, particularly in observational studies. The goal of this paper is to
introduce a new form of indirect effect, the population intervention indirect
effect (PIIE), that can be nonparametrically identified in the presence of an
unmeasured common cause of exposure and outcome. This new type of indirect
effect captures the extent to which the effect of exposure is mediated by an
intermediate variable under an intervention that holds the component of
exposure directly influencing the outcome at its observed value. The PIIE is in
fact the indirect component of the population intervention effect, introduced
by Hubbard and Van der Laan (2008). Interestingly, our identification criterion
generalizes Judea Pearl's front-door criterion as it does not require no direct
effect of exposure not mediated by the intermediate variable. For inference, we
develop both parametric and semiparametric methods, including a novel doubly
robust semiparametric locally efficient estimator, that perform very well in
simulation studies. Finally, the proposed methods are used to measure the
effectiveness of monetary saving recommendations among women enrolled in a

overgrowth enable patterning of highly phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P)
monolayers (ML) with atomic precision. This approach to device fabrication has
made Si:P monolayer systems a testbed for multiqubit quantum computing
architectures and atomically precise 2-D superlattice designs whose behaviors
are directly tied to the deterministic placement of single dopants. However,
dopant segregation, diffusion, surface roughening, and defect formation during
the encapsulation overgrowth introduce large uncertainties to the exact dopant
placement and activation ratio. In this study, we develop a unique method by
combining dopant segregation/diffusion models with sputter profiling simulation
to monitor and control, at the atomic scale, dopant movement using
room-temperature grown locking layers (LL). We explore the impact of LL growth
rate, thickness, rapid thermal anneal, surface accumulation, and growth front
roughness on dopant confinement, local crystalline quality, and electrical
activation within Si:P 2-D systems. We demonstrate that dopant movement can be
more efficiently suppressed by increasing the LL growth rate than by increasing
LL thickness. We find that the dopant segregation length can be suppressed
below a single Si lattice constant by increasing LL growth rates at room
temperature while maintaining epitaxy. Although dopant diffusivity within the
LL is found to remain high even below the hydrogen desorption temperature, we
demonstrate that exceptionally sharp dopant confinement with high electrical
quality within Si:P monolayers can be achieved by combining a high LL growth
rate with a low-temperature LL rapid thermal anneal.

numerical experiments show that they tend to be biased for large coefficients,
especially when the number of large coefficients dominates the number of small

show that, under the irrepresentable condition and other mild technical

existence of a large proportion of strong signals. If the irrepresentable
condition does not hold, the BS-DB is guaranteed to perform no worse than the
debiased Lasso asymptotically. Confidence intervals based on the BS-DB are
proposed and proved to be asymptotically valid under mild conditions. Our study
on the inference problems integrates the properties of the Lasso on variable

form $F_n(z)= \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i \phi_i(z) $, where $\xi_i$ are independent
random variables and $\phi_i (z) $ are arbitrary analytic functions. Starting
with the fundamental works of Kac and Littlewood-Offord in the 1940s, random
functions of this type have been studied extensively in many fields of
mathematics.
  We develop a robust framework to solve the problem by reducing, via
universality theorems, the calculation of the distribution of the roots and the
interaction between them to the case where $\xi_i$ are gaussian. In this
special case, one can use the Kac-Rice formula and various other tools to
obtain precise answers.
  Our framework has a wide range of applications, which include the most
popular models of random functions, such as random trigonometric polynomials
and all basic classes of random algebraic polynomials (Kac, Weyl, and
elliptic). Each of these ensembles has been studied heavily by deep and diverse
methods. Our method, for the first time, provides a unified treatment of all of
them.
  Among the applications, we derive the first local universality result for
random trigonometric polynomials with arbitrary coefficients. When restricted
to the study of real roots, this result extends several recent results, proved
for less general ensembles. For random algebraic polynomials, we strengthen
several recent results of Tao and the second author, with significantly simpler
proofs. As a corollary, we sharpen a classical result of Erd{\""o}s and Offord
on real roots of Kac polynomials, providing an optimal error estimate. Another
application is a refinement of a recent result of Flasche and Kabluchko on the
roots of random Taylor series.

of these properties ahead of time, enabling valuable optimizations and yielding
a more general assurance of correctness. Existing methods for static contract
verification satisfy the needs of more restricted target languages, but fail to
address the challenges unique to those conjoining untyped, dynamic programming,
higher-order functions, modularity, and statefulness. Our approach tackles all
these features at once, in the context of the full Racket system---a mature
environment for stateful, higher-order, multi-paradigm programming with or
without types. Evaluating our method using a set of both pure and stateful
benchmarks, we are able to verify 99.94% of checks statically (all but 28 of
49, 861).
  Stateful, higher-order functions pose significant challenges for static
contract verification in particular. In the presence of these features, a
modular analysis must permit code from the current module to escape permanently
to an opaque context (unspecified code from outside the current module) that
may be stateful and therefore store a reference to the escaped closure. Also,
contracts themselves, being predicates wri en in unrestricted Racket, may
exhibit stateful behavior; a sound approach must be robust to contracts which
are arbitrarily expressive and interwoven with the code they monitor. In this
paper, we present and evaluate our solution based on higher-order symbolic
execution, explain the techniques we used to address such thorny issues,
formalize a notion of behavioral approximation, and use it to provide a

multivariate time series. Although VAR models are intensively investigated by
many researchers, practitioners often show more interest in analyzing VARX
models that incorporate the impact of unmodeled exogenous variables (X) into
the VAR. However, since the parameter space grows quadratically with the number
of time series, estimation quickly becomes challenging. While several proposals
have been made to sparsely estimate large VAR models, the estimation of large
VARX models is under-explored. Moreover, typically these sparse proposals
involve a lasso-type penalty and do not incorporate lag selection into the
estimation procedure. As a consequence, the resulting models may be difficult
to interpret. In this paper, we propose a lag-based hierarchically sparse
estimator, called ""HVARX"", for large VARX models. We illustrate the usefulness
of HVARX on a cross-category management marketing application. Our results show
how it provides a highly interpretable model, and improves out-of-sample
forecast accuracy compared to a lasso-type approach.

Iterative Boltzmann Inversion technique [Reith, P\""{u}tz \& M\""{u}ller-Plathe,

is based on a trial bridge function in the Ornstein-Zernike integral equation
formalism. As an input, the new method requires the particle pair correlations
both in real space and in the Fourier conjugate wavenumber space. An
accelerated iteration method is included in the discussion, by which the
required number of iterations can be greatly reduced below that of the simple
Picard iteration that underlies most common implementations of Iterative

the new method generally surpasses the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion method in
terms of reliability of the numerical solution for the particle pair potential.

types of candidate classes in the combined model space such as spaces of linear

due to analytical ease. However, many noise processes do not follow a Gaussian

described by the Gaussian model. We test the proposed method to choose between
various impulsive distribution families to model both synthetically generated
noise processes and real-life measurements on power line communications (PLC)

efficiency and effectiveness problems. We claim that the enforcement of
non-functional properties as a pillar of SDN robustness calls for a systemic
approach. As a general concept, we propose ANCHOR, a subsystem architecture
that promotes the logical centralization of non-functional properties. To show
the effectiveness of the concept, we focus on 'security' in this paper: we
identify the current security gaps in SDNs and we populate the architecture
middleware with the appropriate security mechanisms, in a global and consistent
manner. Essential security mechanisms provided by anchor include reliable
entropy and resilient pseudo-random generators, and protocols for secure
registration and association of SDN devices. We claim and justify in the paper
that centralizing such mechanisms is key for their effectiveness, by allowing
us to: define and enforce global policies for those properties; reduce the
complexity of controllers and forwarding devices; ensure higher levels of
robustness for critical services; foster interoperability of the non-functional
property enforcement mechanisms; and promote the security and resilience of the
architecture itself. We discuss design and implementation aspects, and we prove

($\sigma$$\sim$0.4 Gyr) and chemical abundances ($\sigma$$<$0.01~dex) of 12
neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, and Dy).
This valuable dataset allows us to study the [X/Fe]-age relations over a time
interval of $\sim$10 Gyr and among stars belonging to the thin and thick discs.
These relations show that i) the $s$-process has been the main channel of
nucleosynthesis of $n$-capture elements during the evolution of the thin disc;
ii) the thick disc is rich in $r$-process elements which suggests that its
formation has been rapid and intensive. %; iii) a chemical continuity between
the thin and thick discs is evident in the abundances of Ba. In addition, the
heavy (Ba, La, Ce) and light (Sr, Y, Zr) $s$-process elements revealed details
on the dependence between the yields of AGB stars and the stellar mass or
metallicity. Finally, we confirmed that both [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al] ratios can be
employed as stellar clocks, allowing ages of solar twin stars to be estimated

theories. The first field theory is quantum electrodynamics in three space-time
dimensions (QED3) with four flavors of fermions. We show this theory can
describe the surfaces of a majority of bosonic pgSPT phases protected by a
single mirror reflection, or by $C_{nv}$ point group symmetry for $n=2,3,4,6$.
The second field theory is a variant of QED3 with charge-1 and charge-3 Dirac
fermions. This field theory can describe the surface of a reflection symmetric
pgSPT phase built by placing an $E_{8}$ state on the mirror plane. The third
field theory is an ${\rm O}(4)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological
theta-term at $\theta=\pi$, or, equivalently, a non-compact ${\rm CP}^1$ model.
Using a coupled wire construction, we show this is a surface theory for bosonic
pgSPT phases with ${\rm U}(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{P}$ symmetry. For the
latter two field theories, we discuss the connection to gapped surfaces with
topological order. Moreover, we conjecture that the latter two field theories

  2. The Markov chain is geometrically ergodic in $L_\infty^{v,1}$: There is a
unique invariant probability measure $\pi$ and constants $B<\infty$ and
$\delta>0$ such that, for each $f\in L_\infty^{v,1}$, any initial condition
$X(0)=x$, and all $t\geq 0$: $$\Big| \text{E}_x[f(X(t))] - \pi(f)\Big| \le

recent years, with the number of opioid overdose fatalities steadily increasing
since the 1990s. In contrast to the dynamics of a typical illicit drug or
disease epidemic, opioid addiction has its roots in legal, prescription
medication - a fact which greatly increases the exposed population and provides
additional drug accessibility for addicts. In this paper, we present a
mathematical model for prescription drug addiction and treatment with
parameters and validation based on data from the opioid epidemic. Key dynamics
considered include addiction through prescription, addiction from illicit
sources, and treatment. Through mathematical analysis, we show that no
addiction-free equilibrium can exist without stringent control over how opioids
are administered and prescribed, effectively transforming the dynamics of the
opioid epidemic into those found in a purely illicit drug model. Numerical
sensitivity analysis suggests that relatively low states of endemic addiction
can be obtained by primarily focusing on medical prevention followed by
aggressive treatment of remaining cases - even when the probability of relapse
from treatment remains high. Further empirical study focused on understanding
the rate of illicit drug dependence versus overdose risk, along with the
current and changing rates of opioid prescription and treatment, would shed
significant light on optimal control efforts and feasible outcomes for this
epidemic and drug epidemics in general.

networks in the context of cognitive social structures (CSSs) data. We adopt a
relativist approach in which no assumption is made about the existence of an
underlying true network. More specifically, we rely on a generalized linear
model that incorporates a bilinear structure to model transitivity effects
within networks, and a hierarchical specification on the bilinear effects to
borrow information across networks. This is a spatial model, in which the
perception of each individual about the strength of the relationships can be
explained by the perceived position of the actors (themselves and others) on a
latent social space. A key goal of the model is to provide a mechanism to
formally assess the agreement between each actors' perception of their own
social roles with that of the rest of the group. Our experiments with both real
and simulated data show that the capabilities of our model are comparable with
or, even superior to, other models for CSS data reported in the literature.

models, can be observed in the dynamical scaling of thermal transport.
Remarkably, we show estimate with unprecedented precision, that $\psi$ appears
to be the scaling exponent of heat mode correlation in a purely quartic
anharmonic chain. This observation seems somewhat deviation from the previous
expectation and we explain it by the unusual slow decay of the
cross-correlation between heat and sound modes. Whenever the cubic
anharmonicity is included, this cross-correlation is gradually died out and
another universality class with scaling exponent $\gamma=5/3$, as commonly
predicted by theories, seems recovered. However, this recovery is accompanied
by two interesting phase transition processes characterized by a change of
symmetry of the potential and a clear variation of the dynamic structure
factor, respectively. Due to these transitions, an additional exponent close to
$\gamma \simeq 1.580$ emerges. All these evidences suggest that, to gain a full
prediction of the scaling of thermal transport, more ingredients should be
taken into account.

Specifically, we formulate an edge-aware depth-normal consistency term, and
solve it by constructing a depth-to-normal layer and a normal-to-depth layer

and computes normal directions using cross production based on neighboring

regularized depth map through local planar smoothness. Both layers are computed
with awareness of edges inside the image to help address the issue of
depth/normal discontinuity and preserve sharp edges. Finally, to train the
network, we apply the photometric error and gradient smoothness for both depth

geographical shapes that are regular or irregular (e.g., postcode). Moreover,
sometimes it is important to obtain predictive inference in regular or
irregular areal shapes that is misaligned with the observed spatial areal
geographical boundary. For example, in a survey the respondents were asked
about their postcode, however for policy making purposes, researchers are often
interested to obtain information at the SA2. The statistical challenge is to
obtain spatial prediction at the SA2s, where the SA2s may have overlapped
geographical boundaries with postcodes. The study is motivated by a practical
survey data obtained from the Australian National University (ANU) Poll. Here
the main research question is to understand respondents' satisfaction level
with the way Australia is heading. The data are observed at 1,944 postcodes
among the 2,516 available postcodes across Australia, and prediction is
obtained at the 2,196 SA2s. The proposed method also explored through a
grid-based simulation study, where data have been observed in a regular grid
and spatial prediction has been done in a regular grid that has a misaligned
geographical boundary with the first regular grid-set. The real-life example
with ANU Poll data addresses the situation of irregular geographical boundaries
that are misaligned, i.e., model fitted with postcode data and hence obtained
prediction at the SA2. A comparison study is also performed to validate the
proposed method. In this paper, a Gaussian model is constructed under Bayesian
hierarchy. The novelty lies in the development of the basis function that can
address spatial sparsity and localised spatial structure. It can also address
the large-dimensional spatial data modelling problem by constructing knot based
reduced-dimensional basis functions.

agency will enable more powerful interactions between human users and next
generation prosthetic devices, especially when the sensorimotor space of the

communication channels available to a prosthetic user. To more concretely
examine an agency-based view on prosthetic devices, we propose a new schema for

communicative capital as a way of thinking about the communication resources

increasing the agency of a prosthetic limb. To do so, we present an analysis of

analyzing the motion patterns across successive frames. The hand regions can
then be located by extending from the seed regions, according to the scores
computed for the adjacent superpixels. These scores are derived from four
egocentric cues: contrast, location, position consistency and appearance
continuity. We discuss how to apply the proposed method in real-life scenarios,
where multiple hands irregularly appear and disappear from the videos.

attracting significant research interest, their potential harmful impacts on

to radio frequency (RF) fields in a cellular communications system has been
focused on uplink only due to the closer physical contact of a transmitter to a
human body. However, this paper claims the necessity of thorough investigation
on human exposure to downlink RF fields, as cellular systems deployed in mmW
bands will entail (i) deployment of more transmitters due to smaller cell size
and (ii) higher concentration of RF energy using a highly directional antenna.
In this paper, we present human RF exposure levels in downlink of a Fifth
Generation Wireless Systems (5G). Our results show that 5G downlink RF fields
generate significantly higher power density (PD) and specific absorption rate
(SAR) than a current cellular system. This paper also shows that SAR should
also be taken into account for determining human RF exposure in the mmW

by the progress in the atomic matter-wave interferometry, which solely utilizes
the standing light waves to split, deflect and recombine the atomic beam. Our
scheme consists of three drag-free satellites orbiting the Earth. The phase
shift of AIGSO is dominated by the Sagnac effect of gravitational-waves, which
is proportional to the area enclosed by the atom interferometer, the frequency
and amplitude of gravitational-waves. The scheme has a strain sensitivity $<
10^{-20}/\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ in the 100 mHz-10 Hz frequency range, which fills in
the detection gap between space-based and ground-based laser interferometric
detectors. Thus, our proposed AIGSO can be a good complementary detection
scheme to the space-borne laser interferometric schemes, such as LISA.

AIGSO to be a promising candidate for the future space-based gravitational-wave

The energy spectrum of the dust-velocity has a power-law range with an exponent
that is same as the gas-velocity spectrum except at very high Fourier modes;
The compressibility of the dust-velocity field is proportional to ${\rm St}^2$.
We quantify the topological properties of the dust-velocity and the
gas-velocity through their gradient matrices, called $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$, respectively. The topological properties of $\mathcal{B}$ are
the same in Eulerian and Lagrangian frames only if the Eulerian data are
weighed by the dust-density -- a correspondence that we use to study Lagrangian
properties of $\mathcal{A}$. In the Lagrangian frame, the mean value of the

The topology of the dust-velocity fields shows that as ${\rm St} increases the

reactions, the rate is usually determined by the surface kinetics of the
hydrogen atom instead of the other reaction partner. Three mechanisms exist to
explain hydrogen addition reactions on surfaces: Langmuir-Hinshelwood,
Eley-Rideal, and hot-atom. In gas-grain models, which mechanism is assumed
greatly affects the simulation results. In this work, we quantify the
temperature dependence of the rates of atomic hydrogen addition reactions by
studying the reaction of H+O$_3$$\rightarrow$O$_2$+OH on the surface of a film
of non-porous amorphous solid water (np-ASW) in the temperature range from 10 K

disagrees with the results of simulations with a network of rate equations that
assume Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism through either thermal diffusion or
tunneling diffusion; the reaction rates assuming such mechanism possesses a
strong temperature dependence, either explicitly or implicitly, that is not
seen experimentally. We suggest that the Eley-Rideal and/or hot-atom mechanism
play a key role in hydrogen atom addition reactions, and should be included in
gas-grain models. We also suggest that our newly developed time-resolved

HC3N, HNC, C2H, H13CO+ and N2H+. Previous studies indicate the HNCO abundance
could be enhanced by shocks. However, in this study, we found the abundance of
HNCO does not correlate well with that of SiO, which is also a good tracer of
shocks. We suggest this may be because HNCO and SiO trace different parts of
shocks. Our analysis indicates that the velocity of shock traced by HNCO tends
to be lower than that traced by SiO. In the low-velocity shocks traced by HNCO,
the HNCO abundance increases faster than that of SiO. While in the relatively

with the accumulation of small fragments near the origin. This model is an
example of record dynamics, with the presence of ""quakes"" and slow dynamics.
The fragment size distribution is a universal inverse power law with
logarithmic corrections. The exact distribution for the fragment number as
function of time is simply related to the unsigned Stirling numbers of the
first kind. Two-time correlation functions are defined and computed exactly.
They satisfy scaling relations and exhibit aging phenomena. In particular the
probability that the same number of fragments is found at two different times
$t>s$ is asymptotically equal to $[4\pi\log(s)]^{-1/2}$ when $s\gg 1$ and the
ratio $t/s$ fixed, in agreement with the numerical simulations. The same
process with a reset impedes the aging phenomena beyond a typical time scale
defined by the reset parameter.

batch learning setting, which requires the entire training data to be made
available prior to the learning task. This is not scalable for many real-world
scenarios where new data arrives sequentially in a stream form. We aim to
address an open challenge of ""Online Deep Learning"" (ODL) for learning DNNs on
the fly in an online setting. Unlike traditional online learning that often
optimizes some convex objective function with respect to a shallow model (e.g.,
a linear/kernel-based hypothesis), ODL is significantly more challenging since
the optimization of the DNN objective function is non-convex, and regular
backpropagation does not work well in practice, especially for online learning
settings. In this paper, we present a new online deep learning framework that
attempts to tackle the challenges by learning DNN models of adaptive depth from
a sequence of training data in an online learning setting. In particular, we
propose a novel Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) method for online updating the

large-scale data sets, including both stationary and concept drifting

algorithms using a special case of Valiant's malicious noise, called
$p$-tampering, in which the adversary gets to change any training example with
independent probability $p$ but is limited to only choose malicious examples
with correct labels. They obtained $p$-tampering attacks that increase the
error probability in the so called targeted poisoning model in which the
adversary's goal is to increase the loss of the trained hypothesis over a
particular test example. At the heart of their attack was an efficient
algorithm to bias the expected value of any bounded real-output function
through $p$-tampering.
  In this work, we present new biasing attacks for increasing the expected

study the possibility of PAC learning under $p$-tampering attacks in the
non-targeted (aka indiscriminate) setting where the adversary's goal is to
increase the risk of the generated hypothesis (for a random test example). We
show that PAC learning is possible under $p$-tampering poisoning attacks
essentially whenever it is possible in the realizable setting without the
attacks. We further show that PAC learning under ""correct-label"" adversarial
noise is not possible in general, if the adversary could choose the (still

sense among practitioners of how much further miss ratios can be improved. In
other words, should the systems community continue working on this problem?
Currently, there is no principled answer to this question. In practice, object
sizes often vary by several orders of magnitude, where computing the optimal
miss ratio (OPT) is known to be NP-hard. The few known results on caching with
variable object sizes provide very weak bounds and are impractical to compute
on traces of realistic length.
  We propose a new method to compute upper and lower bounds on OPT. Our key
insight is to represent caching as a min-cost flow problem, hence we call our
method the flow-based offline optimal (FOO). We prove that, under simple
independence assumptions, FOO's bounds become tight as the number of objects
goes to infinity. Indeed, FOO's error over 10M requests of production CDN and
storage traces is negligible: at most 0.3%. FOO thus reveals, for the first
time, the limits of caching with variable object sizes. While FOO is very
accurate, it is computationally impractical on traces with hundreds of millions
of requests. We therefore extend FOO to obtain more efficient bounds on OPT,
which we call practical flow-based offline optimal (PFOO). We evaluate PFOO on
several full production traces and use it to compare OPT to prior online
policies. This analysis shows that current caching systems are in fact still
far from optimal, suffering 11-43% more cache misses than OPT, whereas the best
prior offline bounds suggest that there is essentially no room for improvement.

solve intriguing AI tasks that would otherwise be hard to address. This paper
concerns the problem of quantizing MANNs. Quantization is known to be effective
when we deploy deep models on embedded systems with limited resources.
Furthermore, quantization can substantially reduce the energy consumption of
the inference procedure. These benefits justify recent developments of
quantized multi layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and RNNs. However,
no prior work has reported the successful quantization of MANNs. The in-depth
analysis presented here reveals various challenges that do not appear in the
quantization of the other networks. Without addressing them properly, quantized
MANNs would normally suffer from excessive quantization error which leads to
degraded performance. In this paper, we identify memory addressing
(specifically, content-based addressing) as the main reason for the performance
degradation and propose a robust quantization method for MANNs to address the
challenge. In our experiments, we achieved a computation-energy gain of 22x

measured through the homodyne detection in literature, we first show that the
expectation value of the operator $\hat{b}_{\theta}$ cannot be measured as the
linear combination of the upper- and lower-sidebands from the output of the
balanced homodyne detection. Here, the operators $\hat{b}_{1}$ and
$\hat{b}_{2}$ are the amplitude and phase quadrature in the two-photon

amplitude of the coherent state from the local oscillator. It is also shown
that the interferometer set up of the eight-port homodyne detection realizes

We found that the Sun rotates more differentially at the minimum than at the

  Journal of Combinatorial Algebra",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study (tame) frieze patterns over subsets of the complex numbers, with
particular emphasis on the corresponding quiddity cycles. We provide new
general transformations for quiddity cycles of frieze patterns. As one
application, we present a combinatorial model for obtaining the quiddity cycles
of all tame frieze patterns over the integers (with zero entries allowed),
generalising the classic Conway-Coxeter theory. This model is thus also a model
for the set of specializations of cluster algebras of Dynkin type $A$ in which
all cluster variables are integers.
  Moreover, we address the question of whether for a given height there are
only finitely many non-zero frieze patterns over a given subset $R$ of the
complex numbers. Under certain conditions on $R$, we show upper bounds for the
absolute values of entries in the quiddity cycles. As a consequence, we obtain
that if $R$ is a discrete subset of the complex numbers then for every height
there are only finitely many non-zero frieze patterns over $R$. Using this, we
disprove a conjecture of Fontaine, by showing that for a complex $d$-th root of
unity $\zeta_d$ there are only finitely many non-zero frieze patterns for a
given height over $R=\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_d]$ if and only if $d\in \{1,2,3,4,6\}$.

daily life, as well as in industrial and geotechnical applications. Although
these disordered systems form stable structures if unperturbed, in practice
they do relax because of the presence of unavoidable external influences such
as tapping or shear. Often it is tacitly assumed that for granular systems this
relaxation dynamics is similar to the one of thermal glass-formers, but in fact
experimental difficulties have so far prevented to determine the dynamic
properties of three dimensional granular systems on the particle level. This
lack of experimental data, combined with the fact that in these systems the
motion of the particles involves friction, makes it very challenging to come up
with an accurate description of their relaxation dynamics. Here we use X-ray
tomography to determine the microscopic relaxation dynamics of hard granular
ellipsoids that are subject to an oscillatory shear. We find that the
distribution function of the particle displacement can be described by a Gumbel
law with a shape parameter that is independent of time and the strain amplitude
$\gamma$. Despite this universality, the mean squared displacement of a tagged
particle shows power-laws as a function of time with an exponent that depends
on $\gamma$ and the time interval considered. We argue that these results are
directly related to the existence of the microscopic relaxation mechanisms that
involve friction and memory effects. These observations demonstrate that on the
particle level the dynamical behavior of granular systems is qualitatively
different from the one of thermal glass-formers and instead more similar to the
one of complex fluids. Thus we conclude that granular materials can relax even
when the driving is weak, an insight which impacts our understanding of the
nature of granular solids.

in the case of general linear Bell inequalities. The presented method is then
applied to Werner states of all pure states to show a similar undetectable

the emergence of classicality in a quantum universe. A classical description
emerges when the environment tends to redundantly acquire information about the
pointer states of an open system. In light of recent interest, we apply the
theoretical tools of the framework to a qubit coupled with many bosonic
sub-environments. We examine the degree to which the same classical information
is encoded across collections of: (i) complete sub-environments, and (ii)
residual ""pseudomode"" components of each sub-environment, the conception of
which provides a dynamic representation of the reservoir memory. Overall,
significant redundancy of information is found as a typical result of the
decoherence process. However, by examining its decomposition in terms of
classical and quantum correlations, we discover classical information to be
non-redundant in both cases (i) and (ii). Moreover, with the full collection of
pseudomodes, certain dynamical regimes realize opposite effects, where either
the total classical or quantum correlations predominantly decay over time.
Finally, when the dynamics are non-Markovian, we find that redundant
information is suppressed in line with information back-flow to the qubit. By
quantifying redundancy, we concretely show it to act as a witness to
non-Markovianity in the same way as the trace distance does for nondivisible
dynamical maps.

tripartite Werner-type state suffers from the non-Markovian regimes and one
subsystem of the tripartite is under a non-inertial frame. The conditions for
steerable and nonlocal states can be obtained with respect to the tripartite
Werner-type state established initially. GMS and GMN are very fragile and
vulnerable under the influence of the collective decoherence. GMS and GMN will
vanish with growing intensity of the Unruh effect and the non-Markovian
reservoir. Besides, all achievable GMN's states are steerable, while not every
steerable state (GMS's state) can achieve nonlocality. It means that the
steering-nonlocality hierarchy is still tenable and GMN's states are a strict
subset of the GMS's states in such a scenario. Subsequently, we put forward an
available methodology to recover the damaged GMS and GMN. It turns out that the

assume that exerting control leads to a state-dependent instantaneous reward,

constant marginal value. The aim is to maximize the total expected reward,
minus the total expected cost of reflection. We show that depending on the

of loans, bonds, and other instruments subject to possible default under
multi-factor models. Due to the amount of the portfolio, the heterogeneous
effect of obligors, and the phenomena that default events are rare and mutually
dependent, it is difficult to calculate portfolio credit risk either by means
of direct analysis or crude Monte Carlo under such models. To capture the
extreme dependence among obligors, we provide an efficient simulation method
for multi-factor models with a normal mixture copula that allows the
multivariate defaults to have an asymmetric distribution, while most of the
literature focuses on simulating one-dimensional cases. To this end, we first
propose a general account of an importance sampling algorithm based on an
unconventional exponential embedding, which is related to the classical
sufficient statistic. Note that this innovative tilting device is more suitable
for the multivariate normal mixture model than traditional one-parameter
tilting methods and is of independent interest. Next, by utilizing a fast
computational method for how the rare event occurs and the proposed importance
sampling method, we provide an efficient simulation algorithm to estimate the
probability that the portfolio incurs large losses under the normal mixture
copula. Here the proposed simulation device is based on importance sampling for
a joint probability other than the conditional probability used in previous
studies. Theoretical investigations and simulation studies, which include an
empirical example, are given to illustrate the method.

Period variations have been detected in a number of eclipsing close
compact binary subdwarf B stars (sdBs) and these have often been interpreted as
caused by circumbinary massive planets or brown dwarfs. Various evolutionary
scenarios have been proposed for these stars, but a definite mechanism remains
to be established. Equally puzzling is the formation of these putative
circumbinary objects which must have formed either from the remaining post
common envelope circumbinary disk or survived its evolution. Aims. In this
paper we review the eclipse time variations (ETVs) exhibited by seven such
systems and explore if there is conclusive evidence that the ETVs observed over
the last two decades can reliably predict the presence of circumbinary bodies.
Methods. We report 246 new observations of the seven sdB systems made between
2013 September and 2017 July using a worldwide network of telescopes. We
combined our new data with previously published measurements to analyse the
ETVs of these systems. Results. Our data shows that period variations cannot be
modelled simply on the basis of circumbinary objects. This implies that more
complex processes may be taking place in these systems. From eclipse time
variations, it has historically been suggested that five of the seven binary
systems reported herein had circumbinary objects. Based on our recent
observations and analysis only three systems remain serious contenders. We find
agreement with other observers that at least a decade of observations is
required to establish reliable ephemeris. With longer observational baselines
it is quite conceivable that the data will support the circumbinary object
hypothesis of these binary systems. Also we generally agree with other
observers that larger values of (O-C) residuals are found with secondary
companions of spectral type M5/6 or earlier as a result of an Applegate type
mechanism

indetermination on asteroseismic grid based estimates of masses, radii, and
ages of stars in the red giant branch phase (RGB). We adopted the SCEPtER
pipeline on a grid spanning the mass range [0.8; 1.8] Msun. As observational
constraints, we adopted the star effective temperatures, the metallicity
[Fe/H], the average large frequency spacing $\Delta \nu,$ and the frequency of
maximum oscillation power $\nu_{\rm max}$. The mass loss was modelled following
a Reimers parametrization with the two different efficiencies $\eta = 0.4$ and
$\eta = 0.8$. In the RGB phase, the average error owing only to observational
uncertainty on mass and age estimates is about 8% and 30% respectively. The
bias in mass and age estimates caused by the adoption of a wrong mass loss
parameter in the recovery is minor for the vast majority of the RGB evolution.
The biases get larger only after the RGB bump. In the last 2.5% of the RGB
lifetime the error on the mass determination reaches 6.5% becoming larger than
the random error component in this evolutionary phase. The error on the age
estimate amounts to 9%, that is, equal to the random error uncertainty. These
results are independent of the stellar metallicity [Fe/H] in the explored
range. Asteroseismic-based estimates of stellar mass, radius, and age in the
RGB phase can be considered mass loss independent within the range ($\eta \in
[0.0, 0.8]$) as long as the target is in an evolutionary phase preceding the
RGB bump.

implement the $CPHASE$ gate by a single pulse of the order 2.3 ns. Using this
gate, in combination with single qubit operations, we searched for optimal
conditions to perform the other gates: $CNOT$, $QFT$ and $SWAP$. Our studies

consider non-Hamiltonian systems, such as granular materials, turbulence and

at an optical lattice site can be regarded as a separate site in a synthetic
dimension. In such synthetic ribbon configurations, manipulation of the
transitions between the hyperfine levels provide direct control of the hopping
in the synthetic dimension. This effect was used to simulate a magnetic field
through the ribbon. Precise control over the hopping matrix elements in the
synthetic dimension makes it possible to change this artificial magnetic field
much faster than the time scales associated with atomic motion in the lattice.
In this paper, we consider such a magnetic flux quench scenario in synthetic
dimensions. Sudden changes have not been considered for real magnetic fields as
such changes in a conducting system would result in large induced currents.
Hence, we first study the difference between a time varying real magnetic field
and an artificial magnetic field using a minimal six site model. This minimal
model clearly shows the connection between gauge dependence and the lack of on
site induced scalar potential terms. We then investigate the dynamics of a
wavepacket in an infinite two or three leg ladder following a flux quench and
find that the gauge choice has a dramatic effect on the packet dynamics.
Specifically, a wavepacket splits into a number of smaller packets. Both the
weights and the number of packets depend on the implemented gauge. If an
initial packet, prepared under zero flux in a n--leg ladder, is quenched to
Hamiltonian with a vector potential parallel to the ladder; it splits into at
most $n$ smaller wavepackets. The same initial packet splits up to $n^2$
packets if the vector potential is implemented to be along the rungs. Finally,
we show that edge states in a thick ribbon are robust under the quench only
when the same gap supports an edge state for the final Hamiltonian.

matrix. This assumption is less restrictive than the well known sparse recovery
conditions such as restricted isometry property (RIP), null space property
(NSP) or mutual coherence. In fact, our analysis indicates that this assumption
is tight and cannot be relaxed for the standard DS problems in order to
maintain their sparse recovery stability. As a result, a series of new
stability results for DS and LASSO have been established under various matrix
properties, including the RIP with constant $\delta_{2k}< 1/\sqrt{2}$ and the
(constant-free) standard NSP of order $k.$ We prove that these matrix
properties can yield an identical recovery error bound for DS and LASSO with
stability coefficients being measured by the so-called Robinson's constant,
instead of the conventional RIP or NSP constant. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that the stability results with such a unified feature are
established for DS and LASSO problems. Different from the standard analysis in
this area of research, our analysis is carried out deterministically, and the
key analytic tools used in our analysis include the error bound of linear
systems due to Hoffman and Robinson and polytope approximation of symmetric
convex bodies due to Barvinok.

developed here shows that if the absorption is large enough, and if the

the classical two-level overlapping Additive Schwarz preconditioner (with PEC
boundary conditions on the subdomains) performs optimally -- in the sense that
GMRES converges in a wavenumber-independent number of iterations -- for the
problem with absorption. An important feature of the theory is that it allows
the coarse space to be built from low-order elements even if the PDE is
discretised using high-order elements. It also shows that additive methods with
minimal overlap can be robust. Numerical experiments are given that illustrate
the theory and its dependence on various parameters. These experiments motivate
some extensions of the preconditioners which have better robustness for
problems with less absorption, including the propagative case. At the end of
the paper we illustrate the performance of these on two substantial
applications; the first (a problem with absorption arising from medical

$\left(C_{11}-C_{12}\right)/2$. On warming, the shear mode softens for momentum
transfers near close to half the Brillouin zone boundary, but recovers near the

temporal broadening with increased temperature over this intermediate range of

active-absorbing phase transition upon tuning density $\rho$. We demonstrate
that a broad class of CSSs possesses a remarkable hydrodynamic structure: There
is an Einstein relation $\sigma^2(\rho) = \chi(\rho)/D(\rho)$, which connects
bulk-diffusion coefficient $D(\rho)$, conductivity $\chi(\rho)$ and
mass-fluctuation, or scaled variance of subsystem mass, $\sigma^2(\rho)$.
Consequently, density large-deviations are governed by an equilibriumlike
chemical potential $\mu(\rho) \sim \ln a(\rho)$ where $a(\rho)$ is the activity
in the system. Using the above hydrodynamics, we derive two scaling relations:
As $\Delta = (\rho - \rho_c) \rightarrow 0^+$, $\rho_c$ being the critical
density, (i) the mass-fluctuation $\sigma^2(\rho) \sim \Delta^{1-\delta}$ with
$\delta=0$ and (ii) the dynamical exponent $z = 2 + (\beta -1)/\nu_{\perp}$,
expressed in terms of two static exponents $\beta$ and $\nu_{\perp}$ for
activity $a(\rho) \sim \Delta^{\beta}$ and correlation length $\xi \sim
\Delta^{-\nu_{\perp}}$, respectively. Our results imply that conserved Manna
sandpile, a well studied variant of the CSS, belongs to a distinct universality

law as such, does not obey scaling relation (ii).

initial fields. Both kinetic and magnetic initial helicities lead to maximally
helical magnetic fields after some time, but with different temporal decay
laws. Both are relevant to the early universe, although no mechanisms have yet
been identified that produce magnetic helicity with strengths comparable to the
big bang nucleosynthesis limit at scales comparable to the Hubble horizon at
the electroweak phase transition. Nonhelical magnetically dominated fields
could still produce picoGauss magnetic fields under most optimistic conditions.
Only helical magnetic fields can potentially have nanoGauss strengths at scales
up to 30 kpc today.

Communication (MC-MTC) is currently a hot research topic. Wireless systems are
considered to provide numerous advantages over wired systems in industrial
applications for example. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless
channel, such systems are prone to a wide range of cyber attacks. These range
from passive eavesdropping attacks to active attacks like data manipulation or
masquerade attacks. Therefore it is necessary to provide reliable and efficient
security mechanisms. One of the most important security issue in such a system
is to ensure integrity as well as authenticity of exchanged messages over the
air between communicating devices in order to prohibit active attacks. In the
present work, an approach on how to achieve this goal in MC-MTC systems based
on Physical Layer Security (PHYSEC), especially a new method based on keeping

increase the number of qubits to the thousands or millions of qubits needed for
practical quantum information we present an architecture based on shared
control and a scalable number of lines. Crucially, the control lines define the
qubit grid, such that no local components are required. Our design enables
qubit coupling beyond nearest neighbors, providing prospects for non-planar
quantum error correction protocols. Fabrication is based on a three-layer
design to define qubit and tunnel barrier gates. We show that a double
stripline on top of the structure can drive high-fidelity single-qubit
rotations. Qubit addressability and readout are enabled by self-aligned
inhomogeneous magnetic fields induced by direct currents through
superconducting gates. Qubit coupling is based on the exchange interaction, and
we show that parallel two-qubit gates can be performed at the detuning noise
insensitive point. While the architecture requires a high level of uniformity
in the materials and critical dimensions to enable shared control, it stands
out for its simplicity and provides prospects for large-scale quantum

structural connections. In empirically measured networks, most connections are
short, reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless, a small
number of connections span long distances, consistent with the notion that the
functionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise
function of these long-distance connections is not known, the leading
hypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain
areas and facilitate efficient interareal communication. However, this
hypothesis implies a non-specificity of long-distance connections that we
contend is unlikely. Instead, we propose that long-distance connections serve
to diversify brain areas' inputs and outputs, thereby promoting complex
dynamics. Through analysis of five interareal network datasets, we show that
long-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal
topological distance. In contrast, areas' long-distance and short-range
neighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles, suggesting
that long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between regional inputs
and outputs. Next, we show that -- in isolation -- areas' long-distance
connectivity profiles exhibit non-random levels of similarity, suggesting that
the communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that
may serve to promote robustness. Finally, we use a linearization of
Wilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity
and show that in the absence of long-distance connections, a common measure of
functional diversity decreases. Collectively, our findings suggest that
long-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex

catalogue, and of the combination of Gaia and 2MASS photometry. In TGAS we find
evidence for the presence of a young population, at a parallax $\varpi \sim
2.65 \, \mathrm{mas}$, loosely distributed around some known clusters: 25 Ori,
$\epsilon$ Ori and $\sigma$ Ori, and NGC 1980 ($\iota$ Ori). The low mass
counterpart of this population is visible in the color-magnitude diagrams
constructed by combining Gaia and 2MASS photometry. We study the density
distribution of the young sources in the sky. We find the same groups as in
TGAS, and also some other density enhancements that might be related to the
recently discovered Orion X group, the Orion dust ring, and to the $\lambda$
Ori complex. We estimate the ages of this population and we infer the presence
of an age gradient going from 25 Ori (13-15 Myr) to the ONC (1-2 Myr). We
confirm this age ordering by repeating the Bayesian fit using the Pan-STARRS1
data. The estimated ages towards the NGC 1980 cluster span a broad range of
values. This can either be due to the presence of two populations coming from
two different episodes of star formation or to a large spread along the line of
sight of the same population. Our results form the first step towards using the
Gaia data to unravel the complex star formation history of the Orion region in
terms of the different star formation episodes, their duration, and their
effects on the surrounding interstellar medium.

However, if the option set for the task is not ideal, and cannot express the

efficiency at odds with solution quality. We propose to resolve this dilemma by
decoupling the behavior and target terminations, just like it is done with
policies in off-policy learning. To this end, we give a new algorithm,
Q(\beta), that learns the solution with respect to any termination condition,

of the proposed controller has been carried out in a hierarchical manner of
group decision making, path planning and control. Decision making utilizes
information of the agents using conventional Particle Swarm Algorithm and
information of the movement of filaments to predict the location of the odor

map a trajectory and pass that information to the control level. The
distributed control layer uses sliding mode controllers known for their

HI signal from the epoch of reionization during the phase of partial heating.
During this phase, we assume self-ionized regions, whose size distribution can
be computed using excursion set formalism, to be surrounded by heated regions.
We model the evolution of heating profile around these regions (near zone) and
their merger into the time-dependent background (far zone). We develop a
formalism to compute the two-point correlation function for this topology,
taking into account the heating auto-correlation and heating-ionization
cross-correlation. We model the ionization and X-ray heating using four
parameters: efficiency of ionization, $\zeta$, number of X-ray photons per
stellar baryon, $N_{\rm heat}$, the spectral index of X-ray photons, $\alpha$,
and the minimum frequency of X-ray photons, $\nu_{\rm min}$. We compute the HI
signal in the redshift range $10 < z < 20$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model for a set
of these parameters. We show that the HI signal for a range of scales
$1\hbox{-}8 \, \rm Mpc$ show a peak strength $100\hbox{-}1000 \, \rm (mK)^2$
during the partially heated era. The redshift at which the signal makes a
transition to uniformly heated universe depends on modelling parameters, e.g.
if $\nu_{\rm min}$ is changed from $100 \, \rm eV$ to $1 \, \rm keV$, this
transition moves from $z \simeq 15$ to $z \simeq 12$. This result, along with
the dependence of the HI signal on modelling parameters, is in reasonable
agreement with existing results from N-body simulations.

homogeneous background gradients, typically using a doubly periodic domain in
the (x,y) plane (i.e. perpendicular to the field line). Spatial Fourier
representations are almost universal in local gyrokinetic codes, and the
wavevector-remap method was introduced in [Hammett et. al., Bull Am Phys Soc
VP1 136, (2006)] as a simple method for expressing the local gyrokinetic
equations with a background shear flow in a Fourier representation. Although
extensively applied, the wavevector-remap method has not been formally shown to
converge, and suffers from known unphysicality when the solutions are plotted
in real space [Fox et. al. PPCF 59, 044008]. In this work, we use an analytic
solution in slab geometry to demonstrate that wavevector-remap leads to
incorrect smeared non-linear coupling between modes. We derive a correct,
relatively simple method for solving local gyrokinetics in Fourier space with a
background shear flow, and compare this to the wavevector-remap method. This
allows us to show that the error in wavevector-remap can be seen as an
incorrect rounding in wavenumber space in the nonlinear term. By making minor
modifications to the nonlinear term, we implement the corrected
wavevector-remap scheme in the GENE[25] code and compare results of the
original and corrected wavevector-remap for standard nonlinear benchmark cases.
Certain physical phenomena are impacted by the errors in the original remap
scheme, and these numerical artefacts do not reduce as system size increases:
that is, original wavevector-remap scheme does not converge to the correct
result.

limited 180 KHz bandwidth used in NB-IoT, the time-domain auto-correlation
function (ACF) of transmitted NB positioning reference signal (NPRS) has a wide
main lobe. Without considering that, the performance of ToA estimation can be
degraded for two reasons. Firstly, under multiple-path channel environments,
the NPRS corresponding to different received paths are superimposed on each
other, and so are the cross-correlations corresponding to them. Secondly, the
measured peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) used for detecting the presence of
NPRS is inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we propose a space-alternating
generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) based method to jointly estimate
the number of channel taps, the channel coefficients and the corresponding
delays in NB-IoT systems, with considering the imperfect ACF of NPRS. Such a
proposed method only uses the time-domain cross-correlations between the

through simulations that, the ToA estimation of the proposed method performs
close to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for a single-path channel, and
significantly outperforms a traditional ToA estimator that uses signal-to-noise

electrophysiological parameters of neurons simultaneously with their synaptic

an optimization, with a cost function consisting of both a measurement error
and a model error term. An iterative reweighting of these terms permits a
systematic method to identify the lowest minimum, within a local region of
state space, on the surface of a non-convex cost function. In the model, two
sets of parameter values are associated with two particular functional modes of
network activity: simultaneous firing of all neurons, and a pattern-generating
mode wherein the neurons burst in sequence. The DA procedure is able to recover
these modes if: i) the stimulating electrical currents have chaotic waveforms,
and ii) the measurements consist of the membrane voltages of all neurons in the
circuit. Further, this method is able to prune a model of unnecessarily high
dimensionality to a representation that contains the maximum dimensionality
required to reproduce the provided measurements. This paper offers a
proof-of-concept that DA has the potential to inform laboratory designs for
estimating properties in small and isolatable functional circuits.

natural to consider how the system evolves when the parties perform local
quantum operations with classical communication (LOCC). However, the structure
of LOCC channels is exceedingly complex leaving many important physical
problems unsolved. In this paper we consider generalized resource theories of
entanglement based on different relaxations to the class of LOCC. The behavior
of various entanglement measures is studied under non-entangling channels, as
well as the newly introduced classes of dually non-entangling and
PPT-preserving channels. In an effort to better understand the nature of LOCC
bound entanglement, we study the problem of entanglement distillation in these
generalized resource theories. We first show that unlike LOCC, general
non-entangling maps can be superactivated, in the sense that two copies of the
same non-entangling map can nevertheless be entangling. On the single-copy
level, we demonstrate that every NPT entangled state can be converted into an
LOCC-distillable state using channels that are both dually non-entangling and
having a PPT Choi representation and that every state can be converted into an
LOCC-distillable state using operations belonging to any family of polytopes
that approximate LOCC. We then turn to the stochastic convertibility of
multipartite pure states and show that any two states can be interconverted by
any polytope approximation to the set of separable channels. Finally, as an
analog to $k$-positive maps, we introduce and analyze the set of
$k$-non-entangling channels.

asymptotic stability for switched nonlinear time-varying (NLTV) systems through
the detectability of output-maps. With this aim the notion of reduced limiting
control systems for switched NLTV systems whose switchings verify time/state
dependent constraints, and the concept of weakly zero-state detectability for
those reduced limiting systems are introduced. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for the (global)uniform asymptotic stability of families of
trajectories of the switched system are obtained in terms of this detectability
property. These sufficient conditions in conjunction with the existence of
multiple weak Lyapunov functions, yield a criterion for the (global) uniform
asymptotic stability of families of trajectories of the switched system. This
criterion can be seen as an extension of the classical Krasovskii-LaSalle
theorem. An interesting feature of the results is that no dwell-time
assumptions are made. Moreover, they can be used for establishing the global
uniform asymptotic stability of switched NLTV system under arbitrary
switchings. The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by means
of various interesting examples, including the stability analysis of a

plants or bones, whenever stiffness and low weight are required. These patterns
frequently refine towards a Dirichlet boundary to ensure an effective load
transfer. The paper discusses the optimization of such supporting structures in
a specific class of domain patterns in 2D, which composes of periodic and
branching period transitions on subdomain facets. These investigations can be
considered as a case study to display examples of optimal branching domain
patterns.
  In explicit, a rectangular domain is decomposed into rectangular subdomains,
which share facets with neighbouring subdomains or with facets which split on
one side into equally sized facets of two different subdomains. On each
subdomain one considers an elastic material phase with stiff elasticity
coefficients and an approximate void phase with orders of magnitude softer
material. For given load on the outer domain boundary, which is distributed on
a prescribed fine scale pattern representing the contact area of the shape, the
interior elastic phase is optimized with respect to the compliance cost. The
elastic stress is supposed to be continuous on the domain and a stress based
finite volume discretization is used for the optimization. If in one direction
equally sized subdomains with equal adjacent subdomain topology line up, these
subdomains are consider as equal copies including the enforced boundary
conditions for the stress and form a locally periodic substructure.
  An alternating descent algorithm is employed for a discrete characteristic
function describing the stiff elastic subset on the subdomains and the solution
of the elastic state equation. Numerical experiments are shown for compression

probability of the system to remain in the basin, given that perturbations are
rare enough. This bound is efficient to evaluate numerically.
  To quantify rare enough, we define the notion of the independence time of
such a system. This is the time after which a perturbed state has probably
returned close to the attractor, meaning that subsequent perturbations can be
considered separately. The effect of jump-like perturbations that occur at
least the independence time apart is thus well described by a fixed probability
to exit the basin at each jump, allowing us to obtain the bound.
  To determine the independence time, we introduce the concept of finite-time
basin stability, which corresponds to the probability that a perturbed
trajectory returns to an attractor within a given time. The independence time
can then be determined as the time scale at which the finite-time basin
stability reaches its asymptotic value. Besides that, finite-time basin
stability is a novel probabilistic stability measure on its own, with potential
broad applications in complex systems.

core of the standard database query language SQL. As their evaluation is
expensive and very often dominated by the output size, it is an important task
for database query optimisers to compute estimates on the size of joins and to
find good execution plans for sequences of joins. We study these problems from
a theoretical perspective, both in the worst-case model, and in an average-case
model where the database is chosen according to a known probability
distribution. In the former case, our first key observation is that the
worst-case size of a query is characterised by the fractional edge cover number
of its underlying hypergraph, a combinatorial parameter previously known to
provide an upper bound. We complete the picture by proving a matching lower
bound, and by showing that there exist queries for which the join-project plan
suggested by the fractional edge cover approach may be substantially better
than any join plan that does not use intermediate projections. On the other
hand, we show that in the average-case model, every join-project plan can be
turned into a plan containing no projections in such a way that the expected
time to evaluate the plan increases only by a constant factor independent of
the size of the database. Not surprisingly, the key combinatorial parameter in
this context is the maximum density of the underlying hypergraph. We show how
to make effective use of this parameter to eliminate the projections.

this situation, we consider a boundary stabilization problem for the flow
through a gas pipeline, where the outflow at one end of the pipe that is
governed by the customer's behavior is uncertain. The control action is located
at the other end of the pipe. The feedback law is a classical Neumann velocity
feedback with a feedback parameter $k>0$.
  We show that as long as the $H^1$-norm of the function that describes the
noise in the customer's behavior decays exponentially with a rate that is
sufficiently large, the velocity of the gas can be stabilized exponentially
fast in the sense that a suitably chosen Lyapunov function decays
exponentially. For the exponential stability it is sufficient that the feedback
parameter $k$ is sufficiently large and the stationary state to which the
system is stabilized is sufficiently small. The stability result is local, that
is it holds for initial states that are sufficiently close to the stationary
state.
  This result is an example for the exponential boundary feedback stabilization
of a quasilinear hyperbolic system with uncertain boundary data. The analysis
is based upon the choice of a suitably Lyapunov function. The decay of this
Lyapunov function implies that also the $L^2$-norm of the difference of the

nonregular situations, in which discontinuities in the displacement field may
occur. In the linearized elastic setting, the mechanical foundation of the

This calls for considering the time evolution of elastic and plastic variables,
as the effect of a combination of elastic energy storage and plastic energy
dissipation mechanisms. The quasistatic evolution problem is variationally
reformulated and solved by time discretization. In addition, by a rigorous

identified, if the low-velocity dark matter annihilates through an $s$-channel
off-shell mediator mostly into $\bar{b} b$, and/or annihilates directly into
two ${\it hidden}$ on-shell mediators, which subsequently decay into the quark
pairs. These two kinds of annihilations are $s$ wave. The projected monojet

correlation efficiently. The former is most naturally done through a
multiconfigurational (MC) wave function, whereas the latter can be done by,
e.g., perturbation theory. We have employed a different strategy, namely, a

significantly reduce the I/O burden. For large-scale N-body simulations where
only one snapshot can be compressed at a time, the lossy compression ratio is
very limited because of the fairly low spatial coherence of the particle data.
In this work, we assess the state-of-the-art single-snapshot lossy compression
techniques of two common N-body simulation models: cosmology and molecular
dynamics. We design a series of novel optimization techniques based on the two
representative real-world N-body simulation codes. For molecular dynamics
simulation, we propose three compression modes (i.e., best speed, best
tradeoff, best compression mode) that can refine the tradeoff between the
compression rate (a.k.a., speed/throughput) and ratio. For cosmology
simulation, we identify that our improved SZ is the best lossy compressor with
respect to both compression ratio and rate. Its compression ratio is higher
than the second-best compressor by 11% with comparable compression rate.
Experiments with up to 1024 cores on the Blues supercomputer at Argonne show
that our proposed lossy compression method can reduce I/O time by 80% compared
with writing data directly to a parallel file system and outperforms the
second-best solution by 60%. Moreover, our proposed lossy compression methods
have the best rate-distortion with reasonable compression errors on the tested
N-body simulation data compared with state-of-the-art compressors.

We calibrate the mixing length parameter by comparing model predictions with
the empirical RSG temperatures in Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, Milky Way,
and M31, which are inferred from the TiO band and the spectral energy
distribution (SED). Although our RSG models are computed with the MESA code,
our result may be applied to other stellar evolution codes, including the BEC
and TWIN codes. We find evidence that the mixing length increases with
increasing metallicity for both cases where the TiO and SED temperatures of
RSGs are used for the calibration. Together with the recent finding of a
similar correlation in low-mass red giants by Tayar et al, this implies that
the metallicity dependence of the mixing length is a universal feature in
post-main sequence stars of both low and high masses. Our result implies that
typical Type IIP supernova (SN IIP) progenitors with initial masses of $\sim 10
- 16~M_\odot$ have a radius range of $400 R_\odot \lesssim R \lesssim 800
R_\odot$ regardless of metallicity. As an auxiliary result of this study, we
find that the hydrogen-rich envelope mass of SN IIP progenitors for a given
initial mass is predicted to be largely independent of metallicity if the
Ledoux criterion with slow semiconvection is adopted, while the Schwarzschild
models predict systematically more massive hydrogen-rich envelopes for lower
metallicity.

(BDC + NO$_2$). The design space of this study is bound by UiO-66(M)-R, [M=Zr,
Ti, Hf; R=BDC, BDC+NO$_2$, BDC+NH$_2$]. The elastic modulus was not found to
vary significantly over the structural modification of the design space for
either functionalization and inorganic substitution. However, the
electron-phonon scattering potential was found to be controllable by up to 30\%
through controlled inorganic substitution in the metal clusters of the MOF
structure. The highest electron mobility was predicted for a
UiO-66(Hf$_5$Zr$_1$) achieving a value of approximately 1.4x10$^{-3}$
cm$^2$/V-s. It was determined that functionalization provides a controlled
method of modulating the charge density, while inorganic substitution provides
a controlled method of modulating the electronic mobility. Within the proposed
design space the electrical conductivity was able to be increased by
approximately three times the base conductivity through a combination of
inorganic substitution and functionalization.

favorable performance in recent benchmarks. Nonetheless, the chosen CNN

tracking systems are learned separately, thus the achieved tracking performance
may be suboptimal. Besides, most of these trackers are not designed towards
real-time applications because of their time-consuming feature extraction and
complex optimization details.In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework
to learn the convolutional features and perform the tracking process
simultaneously, namely, a unified convolutional tracker (UCT). Specifically,
The UCT treats feature extractor and tracking process both as convolution
operation and trains them jointly, enabling learned CNN features are tightly
coupled to tracking process. In online tracking, an efficient updating method
is proposed by introducing peak-versus-noise ratio (PNR) criterion, and scale
changes are handled efficiently by incorporating a scale branch into network.
The proposed approach results in superior tracking performance, while
maintaining real-time speed. The standard UCT and UCT-Lite can track generic
objects at 41 FPS and 154 FPS without further optimization, respectively.
Experiments are performed on four challenging benchmark tracking datasets:
OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2014 and VOT2015, and our method achieves state-of-the-art
results on these benchmarks compared with other real-time trackers.

$C^*$-valued inner product structure of a Hilbert $C^*$-module is determined
essentially by the module structure and by the orthogonality structure, pairs
of linear and local orthogonality-preserving mappings are investigated, not a
priori bounded. The intuition is that most often $C^*$-linearity and
boundedness can be derived from the settings under consideration. In
particular, we obtain that if $\mathscr{A}$ is a $C^{*}$-algebra and $T,
S:\mathscr{E}\longrightarrow \mathscr{F}$ are two bounded ${\mathscr A}$-linear
mappings between full Hilbert $\mathscr{A}$-modules, then $\langle x, y\rangle
= 0$ implies $\langle T(x), S(y)\rangle = 0$ for all $x, y\in \mathscr{E}$ if
and only if there exists an element $\gamma$ of the center $Z(M({\mathscr A}))$
of the multiplier algebra $M({\mathscr A})$ of ${\mathscr A}$ such that
$\langle T(x), S(y)\rangle = \gamma \langle x, y\rangle$ for all $x, y\in

$T=(S^*)^{-1}$, and any bounded invertible module operator $T$ may appear.
Varying the conditions on the mappings $T$ and $S$ we obtain further
affirmative results for local operators and for pairs of a bounded and of an

Stanley H. E. and Jr A. J., {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} 104, 018701 (2010)] and
termed as the Li network afterwards. In the Li network model, with the increase
of its spacial exponent, the network's structure will vary from the random type
to the small-world one, and finally to the regular lattice.We first explore how
the spacial exponent influences the synchronizability of Kuramoto oscillators
on single layer Li networks and find that the closer the Li network is to a
regular lattice, the more difficult for it to evolve into synchronization. Then
we investigate synchronizability of duplex Li networks and find that the
existence of inter-layer interaction can greatly enhance inter-layer and global
synchronizability. When the inter-layer coupling strength is larger than a
certain critical value, whatever the intra-layer coupling strength is, the
inter-layer synchronization will always occur. Furthermore, on single layer Li
networks, nodes with larger degrees more easily reach global synchronization,
while on duplex Li networks, this phenomenon becomes much less obvious.
Finally, we study the impact of inter-link density on global synchronization
and obtain that sparse inter-links can lead to the emergence of global
synchronization for duplex Li networks just as dense inter-links do. In a word,
inter-layer interaction plays a vital role in determining synchronizability for
duplex spacial networks with total cost constraint.

used by Bunzarova and Pesheva [Phys. Rev. E 95, 052105 (2017)] for an
one-dimensional model of irreversible aggregation. The model was shown to have
three stationary phases: a many-particle one, MP, a phase with completely
filled configuration, CF, and a boundary perturbed MP+CF phase, depending on
the values of the particle injection ($\alpha$), ejection ($\beta$) and hopping
($p$) probabilities.
  Here we extend the results for the stationary properties of the MP+CF phase,
by deriving exact expressions for the local density at the first site of the
chain and the probability P(1) of a completely jammed configuration. The
unusual phase transition, characterized by jumps in both the bulk density and
the current (in the thermodynamic limit), as $\alpha$ crosses the boundary
$\alpha =p$ from the MP to the CF phase, is explained by the finite-size
behavior of P(1). By using a random walk theory, we find that, when $\alpha$
approaches from below the boundary $\alpha =p$, three different regimes appear,
as the size $L\rightarrow \infty$: (i) the lifetime of the gap between the
rightmost clusters is of the order $O(L)$ in the MP phase; (ii) small jams,
separated by gaps with lifetime $O(1)$, exist in the MP+CF phase close to the
left chain boundary; and (iii) when $\beta =p$, the jams are divided by gaps
with lifetime of the order $O(L^{1/2})$. These results are supported by

Firstly, a
geometric interpretation of determination coefficient was shown. In turn, the
ability to represent the analyzed data and their interdependencies in the form
of easy-to-understand basic geometric structures was shown. As a result of the
analysis of these structures it was proposed to enrich the classical PCA. In
particular, it was proposed a new criterion for the selection of important
principal components and a new algorithm for clustering primary variables by
their level of similarity to the principal components. Virtual and real data
spaces, as well as tensor operations on data, have also been identified.The
anisotropy of the data was identified too.

  arXiv:1603.04657",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we first introduce some new kinds of weighted amalgam spaces.
Then we deal with the vector-valued intrinsic square functions, which are given
by \begin{equation*} \mathcal S_\gamma(\vec{f})(x) = \Bigg(\sum_{j=1}^\infty
\big|\mathcal S_\gamma(f_j)(x) \big|^2\Bigg)^{1/2}, \end{equation*} where
$0<\gamma\leq1$ and \begin{equation*} \mathcal S_\gamma (f_j)(x) =
\left(\iint_{\Gamma(x)} \Big[\sup_{\varphi\in{\mathcal C}_\gamma}
\big|\varphi_t*f_j(y) \big|\Big]^2 \frac{dydt}{t^{n+1}}\right)^{1/2}, \quad
j=1,2,\dots. \end{equation*} In his fundamental work, Wilson established
strong-type and weak-type estimates for vector-valued intrinsic square
functions on weighted Lebesgue spaces. The goal of this paper is to extend his
results to these weighted amalgam spaces. Moreover, we define vector-valued
analogues of commutators with $BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ functions, and obtain the
mapping properties of vector-valued commutators on the weighted amalgam spaces
as well. In the endpoint case, we also establish the weighted weak $L\log
L$-type estimates for vector-valued commutators in the setting of weighted
Lebesgue spaces.

measurements of turtle trajectory were done over land and finally it will be
conducted over sea. We have scheduled an over sea measurement campaign in the
middle of June. This paper shows a signal cross correlation technique used to
characterize the over sea propagation channel.

equation. In population growth model, we assume that rate increase of
population is proportional to current population. That is, dx / dt = kx, x is a
current population, k is proportionality constant represents growth rate. But
in real situation, it is often ambiguous to determine exact amount of current
population. It can be measured approximately. For instance, initially number of
bacteria is approximately 20 and this approximate number can be represented
using fuzzy number. Therefore, the appropriate growth or decay model is
described using fuzzy concept. With this motivation, this paper presents
solution of fuzzy growth and decay model. The solution is analysed using
Seikkala differentiability of fuzzy-valued function.

  algorithms","34 pages, 19 figures",,"10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.11.040",,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a procedure for the dynamic identification of damage in spatial
Timoshenko arches is presented. The proposed approach is based on the
calculation of an arbitrary number of exact eigen-properties of a damaged
spatial arch by means of the Wittrick and Williams algorithm. The proposed
damage model considers a reduction of the volume in a part of the arch, and is
therefore suitable, differently than what is commonly proposed in the main part
of the dedicated literature, not only for concentrated cracks but also for
diffused damaged zones which may involve a loss of mass. Different damage
scenarios can be taken into account with variable location, intensity and
extension of the damage as well as number of damaged segments. An optimization
procedure, aiming at identifying which damage configuration minimizes the
difference between its eigen-properties and a set of measured modal quantities
for the structure, is implemented making use of genetic algorithms. In this
context, an initial random population of chromosomes, representing different
damage distributions along the arch, is forced to evolve towards the fittest
solution. Several applications with different, single or multiple, damaged
zones and boundary conditions confirm the validity and the applicability of the
proposed procedure even in presence of instrumental errors on the measured
data.

in terms of Q-factor, for small antennas is formulated as a multi-objective
optimization problem in current distributions of predefined support. Variants
on the problem are constructed to demonstrate the consequences of requiring a
self-resonant current as opposed to one tuned by an external reactance. The
resulting Pareto-optimal sets reveal the relative cost of valuing low radiation
Q-factor over high efficiency, the cost in efficiency to require a
self-resonant current, the effects of lossy parasitic loading, and other
insights.
