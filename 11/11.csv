moderately active main sequence solar-like stars. In turn, the stellar rotation
period evolves as a result of magnetised stellar winds that carry away angular
momentum. Understanding the interplay between magnetic activity and stellar
rotation is therefore a central task for stellar astrophysics. Angular momentum
evolution models typically employ spin-down torques that are formulated in
terms of the surface magnetic field strength. However, these formulations fail
to account for the magnetic field geometry, unlike those that are expressed in
terms of the open flux, i.e. the magnetic flux along which stellar winds flow.
  In this work, we model the angular momentum evolution of main sequence
solar-mass stars using a torque law formulated in terms of the open flux. This
is done using a potential field source surface model in conjunction with the
Zeeman-Doppler magnetograms of a sample of roughly solar-mass stars. We explore
how the open flux of these stars varies with stellar rotation and choice of
source surface radii. We also explore the effect of field geometry by using two
methods of determining the open flux. The first method only accounts for the
dipole component while the second accounts for the full set of spherical
harmonics available in the Zeeman-Doppler magnetogram. We find only a small
difference between the two methods, demonstrating that the open flux, and
indeed the spin-down, of main sequence solar-mass stars is likely dominated by
the dipolar component of the magnetic field.

wiretap channels based on nonsystematic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.
Different from traditional communications, in the CodeHop scheme, the
legitimate receiver (Bob) rapidly switches the parity-check matrix upon each
correctly received source message block. Given an authenticated public feedback
channel, the transmitter's (Alice) parity-check matrix can also be synchronized
with the receiver's. As a result, once an eavesdropper (Eve) erroneously
decodes a message block, she may not be able to follow the update of subsequent
parity-check matrices. Thus, the average BER of Eve will be very close to $0.5$
if the transmitted number of message blocks is large enough. Focused on the
measure of security gap defined as the difference of channel quality between
Bob and Eve, numerical results show that the CodeHop scheme outperforms other
solutions by sufficiently reducing the security gap without sacrificing the

present parametrizations that correspond to branches of high-mass twin star

  3, 2017",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of very powerful particle accelerators, such as RHIC and the
LHC, it becomes possible to study QCD in high energy collisions, in which the
gluon content of the proton or nucleus is probed and its density becomes often
large enough for nonlinear effects to play a role. This small-x regime of QCD
is well described by an effective theory known as the Color Glass Condensate
(CGC). In this thesis, we introduce the CGC and apply it to two different
problems.
  First, we use the CGC to study forward heavy-quark production in pA
collisions. When the quarks are nearly back-to-back, the CGC result coincides
with the one in the TMD factorization approach. This allows us to extract the
small-x limit of the Weizs\""acker-Williams gluon distribution, as well as the
dipole distribution and one extra gluon TMD. Each of these gluon TMDs is
accompanied by a partner, which couples via the quark mass and which describes
the linearly polarized gluon content of the unpolarized nucleus. We calculate
the six resulting gluon TMDs analytically in the MV model, and evolve them in
rapidity using a numerical implementation of JIMWLK.
  The second problem is situated within heavy-ion physics. Jets, produced in
the scattering of two nuclei, travel through the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)
before reaching the detector, and are attenuated as a result of their
interaction with this medium. This phenomenon, known as jet quenching, is one
of the main probes to investigate the QGP. We focus on the transverse momentum
broadening of a hard particle traveling through a nuclear medium, and employ
small-x techniques to attempt to resum the leading logarithmic corrections due
to soft gluon radiation. Although, ultimately, we can only solve the resulting
in-medium evolution equation to DLA accuracy, we do present a concise framework
for the problem, and draw a detailed comparison with the CGC and with the
literature.

precise data to arrive. For instance, in the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find a mild
tension of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the $\Omega_m$ estimates obtained using $D_V$

find that the concordance model is in tension with the best-fit values provided

Supernova Ia (SNIa) and Observational \textit{Hubble} datasets to perform a
joint analysis on the $\Lambda$CDM model and its standard extensions. By
assuming $\Lambda$CDM scenario, we find that these data provide $H_0 = 69.4 \pm

very time-consuming task and requires a considerable amount of computational
resources. A statistical model trained on a small set of runs can act as a
stochastic approximation of the original climate model, and be used to assess
the uncertainty considerably faster than by resorting to the original climate
model for additional runs. While Gaussian models have been widely employed as
means to approximate climate simulations, the Gaussianity assumption is not
suitable for winds at policy-relevant time scales, i.e., sub-annual. We propose
a trans-Gaussian model for monthly wind speed that relies on an autoregressive
structure with Tukey $g$-and-$h$ transformation, a flexible new class that can
separately model skewness and tail behavior. This temporal structure is
integrated into a multi-step spectral framework that is able to account for
global nonstationarities across land/ocean boundaries, as well as across
mountain ranges. Inference can be achieved by balancing memory storage and
distributed computation for a data set of 220 million points. Once fitted with
as few as five runs, the statistical model can generate surrogates fast and
efficiently on a simple laptop, and provide uncertainty assessments very close
to those obtained from all the available climate simulations (forty) on a
monthly scale.

analysis of the measurements allow for a correlation of data for single neutral

complexes. We find a nearly linear dependency of the fluorescence decay rate on
the emission energy. The experimental data is compared to self-consistent model
calculations within the effective-mass approximation, in which migrating point
charges set onto the surface of the nanoparticles have been assumed to cause
the temporal changes of optical properties. These calculations reveal a nearly
linear relationship between the squared electron-hole wave function overlap,
which is linked to the experimentally determined fluorescence rate, and the
exciton emission energy. Within our model single migrating surface charges are
not sufficient to fully explain the measured rather broad ranges of emission
rates and energies, while two -- and in particular negative -- surface charges
close to the core of the DR induce large enough shifts. Importantly, for our
nanoparticle system, the surface charges more strongly affect the hole wave
function than the electron wave function and both wave functions are still
localized within the dot-like core of the nanoparticle, showing that the type-I
character of the band alignment between core and shell is preserved.

include single qubit control and readout, multiple qubit gate operation,
extremely sensitive and localized sensing and imaging, as well as the ability
to build hybrid quantum systems. To fully exploit these functionalities,
multiple degrees of freedom are highly desirable: in this respect, nanoscale
systems that coherently couple to light and possess spins, allow for storage of
photonic qubits or light-matter entanglement together with processing
capabilities. In addition, all-optical control of spins can be possible for
faster gate operations and higher spatial selectivity compared to direct RF
excitation. Such systems are therefore of high interest for quantum
communications and processing. However, an outstanding challenge is to preserve
properties, and especially optical and spin coherence lifetimes, at the
nanoscale. Indeed, interactions with surfaces related perturbations strongly
increase as sizes decrease, although the smallest objects present the highest
flexibility for integration with other systems. Here, we demonstrate optically
controlled nuclear spins with long coherence lifetimes (T2) in rare earth doped
nanoparticles. We observed spins echoes and measured T2 of 2.9 +/- 0.3 ms at 5
K and under a magnetic field of 9 mT, a value comparable to those obtained in
bulk single crystals. Moreover, we achieve, for the first time, spin T2
extension using all-optical spin dynamical decoupling and observe high fidelity
between excitation and echo phases. Rare-earth doped nanoparticles are thus the
only reported nano-materials in which optically controlled spins with
millisecond coherence lifetimes have been observed. These results open the way
to providing quantum light-atom-spin interfaces with long storage time within
hybrid architectures.

  The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic

cadence supernova search at $r\sim20.1\,\rm{mag}$ in the `edge-on' nearby
($D=20.0\pm1.9\,\rm{Mpc}$) galaxy NGC~1532. The subsequent prompt and
high-cadenced spectroscopic and photometric follow-up revealed a highly
extincted transient, with $E(B-V)=1.95\pm0.15\,\rm{mag}$, consistent with a
standard extinction law with $R_V=3.1$ and a bright
($M_V=-18.49\pm0.65\,\rm{mag}$) absolute peak-magnitude. The comparison of the
photometric features with those of large samples of Type II supernovae reveals
a fast rise for the derived luminosity and a relatively short plateau phase,
with a slope of $S_{50V}=0.84\pm0.04\,\rm{mag}/50\,\rm{d}$ consistent with the
photometric properties typical of those of fast declining Type II supernovae.
Despite the large uncertainties on the distance and the extinction in the
direction of DLT16am, the measured photospheric expansion velocity and the
derived absolute $V$-band magnitude at $\sim50\,\rm{d}$ after the explosion
match the existing luminosity-velocity relation for Type II supernovae.

provisioning computing and storage resources at the edge of networks. However,
due to the uncertainty and diversity of user interests, content popularity,
distributed network structure, cache sizes, it is challenging to decide where
to place the content, and how long it should be cached. In this paper, we study
the utility optimization of content placement at edge networks through
timer-based (TTL) policies. We propose provably optimal distributed algorithms
that operate at each network cache to maximize the overall network utility. Our
TTL-based optimization model provides theoretical answers to how long each
content must be cached, and where it should be placed in the edge network.
Extensive evaluations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms path
replication with conventional caching algorithms over some network topologies.

introducing a parameter per pair of alternatives which specifies the minimum

Boltzmann Equation for electron transport in curvilinear coordinates for the

3D plus time problem. We choose for this problem the spherical coordinate
system $\vec{p}(|\vec{p}|,\mu=cos\theta,\varphi)$, slightly different to the
choice in previous DG solvers for BP, because its DG formulation gives simpler
integrals involving just piecewise polynomial functions for both transport and
collision terms. Applying the strategy of Zhang \& Shu, \cite{ZhangShu1},
\cite{ZhangShu2}, Cheng, Gamba, Proft, \cite{CGP}, and Endeve et al.
\cite{EECHXM-JCP}, we treat the collision operator as a source term, and find
convex combinations of the transport and collision terms which guarantee the
positivity of the cell average of our numerical probability density function at
the next time step. The positivity of the numerical solution to the pdf in the
whole domain is guaranteed by applying the limiters in \cite{ZhangShu1},
\cite{ZhangShu2} that preserve the cell average but modify the slope of the
piecewise linear solutions in order to make the function non - negative. In
addition of the proofs of positivity preservation in the DG scheme, we prove
the stability of the semi-discrete DG scheme under an entropy norm, using the
dissipative properties of our collisional operator given by its entropy
inequalities. The entropy inequality we use depends on an exponential of the
Hamiltonian rather than the Maxwellian associated just to the kinetic energy.

Specifically, we consider the likelihood ratio test for observation-dependent
regime switching in mixture autoregressive models. The testing problem is
highly nonstandard, involving unidentified nuisance parameters under the null,
parameters on the boundary, singular information matrices, and higher-order
approximations of the log-likelihood. We derive the asymptotic null
distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic in a general mixture
autoregressive setting using high-level conditions that allow for various forms
of dependence of the regime switching probabilities on past observations, and
we illustrate the theory using two particular mixture autoregressive models.
The likelihood ratio test has a nonstandard asymptotic distribution that can
easily be simulated, and Monte Carlo studies show the test to have satisfactory
finite sample size and power properties.

assessment, both from a spectral efficiency and energy efficiency point of

a cellular multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) system with large number of antennas.
Analytical formulas for the asymptotic achievable spectral efficiency and for
the global energy efficiency of several beamforming structures are derived in
the large number of antennas regime. Using the most recently available data for
the energy consumption of phase shifters and switches, we show that
fully-digital beamformers may actually achieve a larger energy efficiency than
lower-complexity solutions, as well as that low-complexity beam-steering purely

  Behavior Studies",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predictability of behavior has emerged an an important characteristic in many
fields including biology, medicine, and marketing. Behavior can be recorded as
a sequence of actions performed by an individual over a given time period. This
sequence of actions can often be modeled as a stationary time-homogeneous
Markov chain and the predictability of the individual's behavior can be
quantified by the entropy rate of the process. This paper provides a
comprehensive investigation of three estimators of the entropy rate of finite
Markov processes and a bootstrap procedure for providing standard errors. The
first two methods directly estimate the entropy rate through estimates of the
transition matrix and stationary distribution of the process; the methods
differ in the technique used to estimate the stationary distribution. The third
method is related to the sliding-window Lempel-Ziv (SWLZ) compression
algorithm. The first two methods achieve consistent estimates of the true
entropy rate for reasonably short observed sequences, but are limited by
requiring a priori specification of the order of the process. The method based
on the SWLZ algorithm does not require specifying the order of the process and
is optimal in the limit of an infinite sequence, but is biased for short
sequences. When used together, the methods can provide a clear picture of the
entropy rate of an individual's behavior.

for burst models. The accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658

probing a C^2 / Z_k singularity, the punctures are governed by a dynamical
system in which evolution in time corresponds to motion to a neighboring node

consistent initial conditions which produce periodic orbits. The study of this

specific rational values for the initial momenta lead to periodic orbits, and
small perturbations in these values lead to vastly different late time
behavior. Another difference from half BPS punctures of class S theories
includes the appearance of a continuous complex ""zero mode"" modulus in some

generically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever the gas,
absent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the ""streaming
instability"" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides
simple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for
its growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to
more general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and
magnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most
importantly, we identify the disk ""settling instability,"" which occurs as dust
settles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this
instability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming
instability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth
timescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital
period, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude
larger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate
larger masses). This suggests that in the process of settling, dust will band
into rings then filaments or clumps, potentially seeding dust traps,
high-metallicity regions that in turn seed the streaming instability, or even
overdensities that coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals.

$78\pm4 %$ of the total flux density over 25"" regions ($\approx$ kpc-scales)

likely diffuse non-thermal synchrotron emission. Consequently, on the

discrete HII regions, making it an excellent tracer of massive star formation.

Telescope (HST) blank field imaging surveys have estimated that these clumps

Recently, gravitational lensing has also been used to get higher spatial
resolution. However, both recent lensed observations and models suggest that
the clumps properties may be overestimated by the limited resolution of
standard imaging techniques. A definitive proof of this observational bias is
nevertheless still missing. Here we investigate directly the effect of
resolution on clump properties by analysing multiple gravitationally-lensed

show that the typical mass and size of giant clumps, generally observed at

gravitational lensing using currently available facilities, support smaller

associated with relativistic jets. Models suggest that jet production may be a
universal process common in all black hole systems regardless of their mass.
Although in many cases observations support such hypotheses for microquasars
and Seyfert galaxies, little is known on whether boosted blazar jets also
comply with such universal scaling laws. We use uniquely rich multiwavelength
radio light curves from the F-GAMMA program and the most accurate Doppler
factors available to date to probe blazar jets in their emission rest frame
with unprecedented accuracy. We identify for the first time a strong
correlation between the blazar intrinsic broad-band radio luminosity and black
hole mass, which extends over $\sim$ 9 orders of magnitude down to microquasars
scales. Our results reveal the presence of a universal scaling law that bridges
the observing and emission rest frames in beamed sources and allows us to
effectively constrain jet models. They consequently provide an independent
method for estimating the Doppler factor, and for predicting expected radio
luminosities of boosted jets operating in systems of intermediate or
tens-of-solar mass black holes, immediately applicable to cases as those
recently observed by LIGO.

as Fermi liquids, non-Fermi liquids, and superconductivity, in addition to
potential intertwined orders. The model describes Fermi surfaces of spinful
electron gas or electron liquid coupled to bosons via an intermediate gauge
field. Effectively, the coupling imposes constraints and interactions between
the fermion spin and the local boson density. This grants the bosons the
meaning as the Schwinger boson of the magnetic order and allows us to probe a
larger phase space, rather than around the quantum critical point. We design
the initial model so that after the boson and gauge fields are integrated out
exactly, the resulting fermion-only effective theory only consists of several
local interactions, allowing controlled weak-coupling interpretation for
certain parameter regions. Consequently, we find a non-Fermi liquid whose
degrees of freedom in the effective theory take the form of an \emph{emergent}
Fermi surface that has a different Luttinger volume from the original fermions,
therefore explicitly violates the Luttinger theorem. Further, this allows a
$d$-wave superconducting instability if the effective interacting induced by
boson coupling is in the relevant pairing channel. When the emergent Fermi
surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, the carrier type changes. In addition,
we attribute the Mott insulating behavior in the strong coupling limit to the
loss of emergent Fermi surface and argue the possibility of coexisting magnetic
order. Our effective theory also suggests the possibility of charge density
waves as a consequence of \emph{effective} strong repulsion and is independent
of the Fermi-surface-nesting scenario. We discuss the possible optimal
conditions for higher superconducting transition temperature and potential
relevances and implications for realistic materials.

interpreted as the signature of multi-component ejecta in the merger dynamics.
However, the explanation of AT2017gfo in terms of the properties of the ejecta
and of the ejection mechanisms is still incomplete. In this work, we analyse
AT2017gfo with a new semi-analytic model of kilo/macronova inferred from
general relativistic simulations of the merger and long-term numerical models
of the merger aftermath. The model accounts for the anisotropic emission from
the three known mass ejecta components: dynamic, winds and secular outflows
from the disk. The early multi-band light-curves of AT2017gfo can only be
explained by the presence of a relatively low opacity component of the ejecta
at high latitudes. This points to the key role of weak interactions in setting
the ejecta properties and determining the nucleosynthetic yields. Our model
constrains also the total ejected mass associated to AT2017gfo to be between
$0.042$ and $0.077 M_{\odot}$; the observation angle of the source to be

flows of viscoelastic fluids has provided useful insights into the mechanisms
that may govern the initial stages of transition to elastic turbulence.
However, distributed body forces are not easy to implement in experiments and
so there is a need to examine amplification of localized body forces. In this
work, we use the linearized governing equations to examine such amplification
in Poiseuille flow of FENE-CR fluids. We first identify the wall-normal
location at which the impulsive excitations experience the largest
amplification and then analyze the kinetic energy of the fluctuations and the
resulting flow structures. For both a Newtonian fluid at high Reynolds numbers
and a viscoelastic fluid at low Reynolds numbers, the largest amplification
occurs for disturbances that are located near the channel wall. Our analysis of
the energy evolution shows that a localized body force in the spanwise
direction has the largest impact and that the streamwise velocity component is
most affected. For viscoelastic fluids we observe the development of vortical
structures away from the source of impulsive excitation. This feature is less
prominent in Newtonian fluids and it may provide a mechanism for triggering the
initial stages of transition to elastic turbulence.

closed under the convolution operation. It is said to be inverse-closed if each
element of $\mathcal{X}$ whose spectrum is bounded away from zero has a
convolution inverse that is also part of the algebra. The theory of discrete
Banach convolution algebras is well established with a complete
characterization of the weighted $\ell_1$ algebras that are inverse-closed and
referred to as the Gelfand-Raikov-Shilov (GRS) spaces.
  Our starting point here is the observation that the space
$\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ of rapidly decreasing sequences, {which is not
Banach but nuclear}, is an inverse-closed convolution algebra. This property
propagates to the more constrained space of exponentially decreasing sequences
$\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ that we prove to be nuclear as well. Using a recent
extended version of the GRS condition, we then show that
$\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is actually the smallest inverse-closed convolution
algebra. This allows us to describe the hierarchy of the inverse-closed
convolution algebras from the smallest, $\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, to the
largest, $\ell_{1}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. In addition, we prove that, in contrast to
$\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, all members of $\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ admit
well-defined convolution inverses in $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with the
""unstable"" scenario (when some frequencies are vanishing) giving rise to
inverse filters with slowly-increasing impulse responses. Finally, we use those
results to reveal the decay and reproduction properties of an extended family
of cardinal spline interpolants.

a predictive first-principle formalism that combines ab-initio molecular

algorithmic method for quantifying $(\Omega,\mathbb G,{\rm d}\mathbb P)$ from
first principles. Using the silicon crystal as a working example, we find the
Gibbs measure to be extremely well characterized by a multivariate normal
distribution, which can be quantified using a small number of parameters. The
latter are computed at various temperatures and communicated in the form of a

of Galactic globular clusters, that may originate from hot-hydrogen-burning
products ejected by a previous generation of massive stars. We present and
investigate a scenario in which the second generation of polluted low-mass
stars can form in shells around cool supergiant stars within a young globular
cluster. Simulations of low-Z massive stars (M$_{\rm i}\sim$ 150$-$600
M$_{\odot}$) show that both core-hydrogen-burning cool supergiants and hot
ionizing stellar sources are expected to be present simulaneously in young
globular clusters. Under these conditions, photoionization-confined shells form
around the supergiants. We find that the shell is gravitationally unstable on a
timescale that is shorter than the lifetime of the supergiant, and the
Bonnor-Ebert mass of the overdense regions is low enough to allow star
formation. Since the low-mass stellar generation formed in this shell is made
up of the material lost from the supergiant, its composition necessarily
reflects the composition of the supergiant wind. We show that the wind contains
hot-hydrogen-burning products, and that the shell-stars therefore have very
similar abundance anomalies that are observed in the second generation stars of
globular clusters. Considering the mass-budget required for the second
generation star-formation, we offer two solutions. Either a top-heavy initial
mass function is needed with an index of $-$1.71..$-$2.07. Alternatively, we
suggest the shell-stars to have a truncated mass distribution, and solve the
mass budget problem by justifiably accounting for only a fraction of the first
generation. Even without forming a photoionizaton-confined shell, the cool
supergiant stars predicted at low-Z could contribute to the pollution of the
interstellar medium of the cluster from which the second generation was born.

ignition characteristics and low-temperature chemistry or LTC of DME/O2/Ar
mixtures are numerically investigated in a plane-to-plane geometry at a reduced
pressure of 76 Torr. Detailed numerical investigations of the two-stage
ignition process in different temperature regimes of DME have been created
through a high-fidelity one-dimensional, multi-timescale plasma-discharge
model. Two different initial temperatures are set for comparison: 550K, the
negative temperature coefficient regime, where LTC plays a dominate role; 800K,
the intermediate temperature regime, where LTC normally does not play an
important role. The results have shown that, in NTC regime, non-equilibrium
plasma discharge improves the overall ignition delay time by 15 times with a
significant improvement of approximately 250 times for the first-stage
ignition. In Intermediate temperature regime, the two-stage ignition property
is reactivated by the addition of plasma, and the overall ignition delay is
shortened by approximately 75 times. This observation suggests that, in the
intermediate temperature regime, the plasma discharges can not only enhance DME
ignition characteristics but also alter the reaction pathways to a reactive LTC
reaction pathway; therefore, the two-stage ignition behavior occurred again.
Further investigation suggests that the plasma enhancement on ignition and LTC
in the intermediate temperature regime is non-linear. As the accumulative
energy input to the system increases, the enhancement from the non-equilibrium
plasma discharge reaches a limit. Considering the total amount of heat release,
the optimized voltage pulse number appears to be in the range of 35-40 to
provide the most efficient enhancement for the overall ignition delay time.

the vorticity filed is decomposed into wavelet coefficients, that are split
into strong and weak coefficients, before reconstructing them in physical space
to obtain the corresponding coherent and incoherent vorticities. Both
components are multiscale and orthogonal to each other. Then, by using the
Biot--Savart kernel, one obtains the coherent and incoherent velocities.
Advancing the coherent flow in time, while filtering out the noise-like
incoherent flow, models turbulent dissipation and corresponds to an adaptive
regularization. In order to track the flow evolution in both space and scale, a
safety zone is added in wavelet coefficient space to the coherent wavelet
coefficients. It is shown that the coherent flow indeed exhibits an
intermittent nonlinear dynamics and a $k^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum, where $k$ is
the wavenumber, characteristic of { three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic
turbulence}. Finally, we compare the dynamical and statistical properties of
Euler flows subjected to four kinds of regularizations: dissipative

these methods do not scale well to a large-scale setting, and this is partly
due to the inaccurate pointwise or pairwise rank estimation. We propose a new
framework for personalized ranking. It uses batch-based rank estimators and
smooth rank-sensitive loss functions. This new batch learning framework leads
to more stable and accurate rank approximations compared to previous work.
Moreover, it enables explicit use of parallel computation to speed up training.

each class, spread more (with higher variance) in the embedding space of the
CNN compared to representations of the training data. More importantly, this
difference is more extreme if the unseen data comes from a shifted
distribution. Based on this observation, we objectively evaluate the degree of
representation's variance in each class via eigenvalue decomposition on the
within-class covariance of the internal representations of CNNs and observe the
same behaviour. This can be problematic as larger variances might lead to
mis-classification if the sample crosses the decision boundary of its class. We
apply nearest neighbor classification on the representations and empirically
show that the embeddings with the high variance actually have significantly
worse KNN classification performances, although this could not be foreseen from
their end-to-end classification results. To tackle this problem, we propose
Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis (DWCCA), a deep neural network layer that
significantly reduces the within-class covariance of a DNN's representation,
improving performance on unseen test data from a shifted distribution. We
empirically evaluate DWCCA on two datasets for Acoustic Scene Classification
(DCASE2016 and DCASE2017). We demonstrate that not only does DWCCA
significantly improve the network's internal representation, it also increases
the end-to-end classification accuracy, especially when the test set exhibits a

large NEAs evolve from the main belt by different escape routes, have a

also investigate limits of the model when a stiffness parameter, called the

orthogonal frames adapted to the polymer and to express conformational changes

can typically ensure the existence of high quality solutions for most
motion-planning problems, but the size of the roadmap, particularly in
high-dimensional spaces, makes existing search-based planning algorithms
computationally expensive. We deal with the challenges of expensive search and
collision checking in two ways. First, we frame the problem of anytime motion
planning on roadmaps as searching for the shortest path over a sequence of
subgraphs of the entire roadmap graph, generated by some densification
strategy. This lets us achieve bounded sub-optimality with bounded worst-case
planning effort. Second, for searching each subgraph, we develop an anytime
planning algorithm which uses a belief model to compute the collision
probability of unknown configurations and searches for paths that are
Pareto-optimal in path length and collision probability. This algorithm is
efficient with respect to collision checks as it searches for successively
shorter paths. We theoretically analyze both our ideas and evaluate them
individually on high-dimensional motion-planning problems. Finally, we apply
both of these ideas together in our algorithmic framework for anytime motion

assuming an $R^{-1}$ dust surface density profile. Our lack of CO detections in
the majority of our sample is consistent with these small disk sizes assuming
the dust and CO share the same spatial distribution. Of seven disks in our
sample with well-constrained dust and CO radii, four appear to be more extended
in CO, although this may simply be due to higher optical depth of the CO.
Comparison of the Upper Sco results with recent analyses of disks in Taurus,
Ophiuchus, and Lupus suggests that the dust disks in Upper Sco may be $\sim3$
times smaller in size than their younger counterparts, although we caution that
a more uniform analysis of the data across all regions is needed. We discuss
the implications of these results for disk evolution.

been used to represent a set of local descriptors in visual recognition. Recent
study shows that kernel matrix can give considerably better representation by
modelling the nonlinearity in the local descriptor set. Nevertheless, neither
the descriptors nor the kernel matrix is deeply learned. Worse, they are
considered separately, hindering the pursuit of an optimal SPD representation.
This work proposes a deep network that jointly learns local descriptors,
kernel-matrix-based SPD representation, and the classifier via an end-to-end
training process. We derive the derivatives for the mapping from a local
descriptor set to the SPD representation to carry out backpropagation. Also, we
exploit the Daleckii-Krein formula in operator theory to give a concise and
unified result on differentiating SPD matrix functions, including the matrix
logarithm to handle the Riemannian geometry of kernel matrix. Experiments not
only show the superiority of kernel-matrix-based SPD representation with deep
local descriptors, but also verify the advantage of the proposed deep network
in pursuing better SPD representations for fine-grained image recognition
tasks.

degenerate. For such systems, perturbation methods using the distribution
function can be problematic. Instead we present a model that considers the
dynamics of the Fermi surface. The advantage of this model is that, even though
the value of the distribution function can be greatly perturbed outside the
equilibrium Fermi surface, deformation of Fermi surface is small up very large
amplitudes. Next, we investigate the short-scale dynamics for which the
Wigner-Moyal equation replaces the Vlasov equation. In particular, we study
wave-particle interaction, and deduce that new types of wave damping can occur
due to the simultaneous absorption (or emission) of multiple wave quanta.
Finally, we consider exchange effects within a quantum kinetic formalism to
find a model more accurate than ones using exchange potentials from density
functional theory. We deduce the exchange corrections to the dispersion
relations for Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves. Comparing with results based on
exchange potentials deduced from density functional theory we find that the
latter models are reasonably accurate for Langmuir waves, but rather inaccurate
for ion acoustic waves.

intricate process to bind a wide array of pathogens. This process involves

""mutation motifs"", which are short DNA subsequences that affect how likely a
given site is to experience a mutation. Quantifying the effect of motifs on
mutation rates is challenging: a large number of possible motifs makes this
statistical problem high dimensional, while the unobserved history of the
mutation process leads to a nontrivial missing data problem. We introduce an
$\ell_1$-penalized proportional hazards model to infer mutation motifs and
their effects. In order to estimate model parameters, our method uses a Monte
Carlo EM algorithm to marginalize over the unknown ordering of mutations. We
show that our method performs better on simulated data compared to current

hazards to mutation processes is, to our knowledge, novel and formalizes the
current methods in a statistical framework that can be easily extended to
analyze the effect of other biological features on mutation rates.

This map is then used to develop a downscaling data assimilation scheme for
statistical solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, where the
coarse mesh spatial statistics of the system is obtained from discrete spatial
measurements. As a corollary, we deduce that statistical solutions for the
Navier-Stokes equations are determined by their coarse mesh spatial
distributions. Notably, we present our results in the context of the
Navier-Stokes equations; however, the tools are general enough to be
implemented for other dissipative evolution equations.

the news industry has started to explore and invest in news automation. In this
paper, we present Reuters Tracer, a system that automates end-to-end news
production using Twitter data. It is capable of detecting, classifying,
annotating, and disseminating news in real time for Reuters journalists without
manual intervention. In contrast to other similar systems, Tracer is topic and
domain agnostic. It has a bottom-up approach to news detection, and does not
rely on a predefined set of sources or subjects. Instead, it identifies
emerging conversations from 12+ million tweets per day and selects those that
are news-like. Then, it contextualizes each story by adding a summary and a
topic to it, estimating its newsworthiness, veracity, novelty, and scope, and
geotags it. Designing algorithms to generate news that meets the standards of
Reuters journalists in accuracy and timeliness is quite challenging. But Tracer
is able to achieve competitive precision, recall, timeliness, and veracity on
news detection and delivery. In this paper, we reveal our key algorithm designs
and evaluations that helped us achieve this goal, and lessons learned along the

performances of a wide range of existing knowledge graph embedding models.
Because knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts, sampling useful
negative training examples is a non-trivial task. Replacing the head or tail
entity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventional
method for generating negative facts, but the majority of the generated
negative facts can be easily discriminated from positive facts, and will
contribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarial
networks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negative
sample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the
discriminator in GANs. This framework is independent of the concrete form of
generator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety of
knowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks. In experiments, we
adversarially train two translation-based models, TransE and TransD, each with
assistance from one of the two probability-based models, DistMult and ComplEx.
We evaluate the performances of KBGAN on the link prediction task, using three
knowledge base completion datasets: FB15k-237, WN18 and WN18RR. Experimental
results show that adversarial training substantially improves the performances

satisfies the biharmonic equation. The detailed behavior of solutions to the
biharmonic equation on regions with corners has been historically difficult to
characterize. The problem was first examined by Lord Rayleigh in 1920; in 1973,
the existence of infinite oscillations in the domain Green's function was
proven in the case of the right angle by S.~Osher. In this paper, we observe
that, when the biharmonic equation is formulated as a boundary integral
equation, the solutions are representable by rapidly convergent series of the
form $\sum_{j} ( c_{j} t^{\mu_{j}} \sin{(\beta_{j} \log{(t)})} + d_{j}
t^{\mu_{j}} \cos{(\beta_{j} \log{(t)})} )$, where $t$ is the distance from the
corner and the parameters $\mu_{j},\beta_{j}$ are real, and are determined via
an explicit formula depending on the angle at the corner. In addition to being
analytically perspicuous, these representations lend themselves to the
construction of highly accurate and efficient numerical discretizations,
significantly reducing the number of degrees of freedom required for the
solution of the corresponding integral equations. The results are illustrated

modeling techniques have become important tools for analyzing cellular
metabolism. Thermodynamically infeasible cy-cles (TICs) causing unbounded
metabolic flux ranges are often encountered. TICs satisfy the mass balance and
directionality constraints but violate the second law of thermodynamics.
Current prac-tices involve implementing additional constraints to ensure not
only optimal but also loopless flux distributions. However, the mixed integer
linear programming problems required to solve become computationally
intractable for genome-scale metabolic models. Results: We aimed to identify
the fewest needed constraints sufficient for optimality under the loop-less
requirement. We found that loopless constraints are required only for the
reactions that share elementary flux modes representing TICs with reactions
that are part of the objective function. We put forth the concept of localized
loopless constraints (LLCs) to enforce this minimal required set of loopless
constraints. By combining with a novel procedure for minimal null-space
calculation, the computational time for loopless flux variability analysis is
reduced by a factor of 10-150 compared to the original loopless constraints and
by 4-20 times compared to the currently fastest method Fast-SNP with the
percent improvement increasing with model size. Importantly, LLCs offer a
scalable strategy for loopless flux calculations for
multi-compartment/multi-organism models of very large sizes (e.g. >104
reactions) not feasible before. Matlab functions are available at

population associated with the two H II regions are studied in detail using
measurements at near-infrared, mid-infrared, far-infrared, submillimeter and
radio wavelengths.
  Methods. The radio continuum maps at 1280 and 610 MHz were obtained using the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to probe the ionized gas. The dust temperature,
column density and dust emissivity maps were generated by using modified
blackbody fits in the far-infrared wavelength range 160 - 500 {\mu}m. Various
near- and mid-infrared colour and magnitude criteria were adopted to identify
candidate ionizing star(s) and the population of young stellar objects in the
associated field.
  Results. The radio maps reveal the presence diffuse ionized emission
displaying distinct cometary morphologies. The 1280 MHz flux densities
translate to ZAMS spectral types in the range O7.5V - O7V and O8.5V - O8V for
the ionizing stars of G346.056-0.021 and G346.077-0.056, respectively. A few
promising candidate ionizing star(s) are identified using near-infrared

additional clumps one being associated with G346.056-0.021. The masses of the
clumps are estimated to range between {\sim} 1400 to 15250 M{\sun}. Based on
simple analytic calculations and the correlation seen between the ionized gas

convex constraints on the feasible edge set. Unlike previous methods, our
method is justifiably not greedy and capable of accommodating these additional

respond to the adversary's action without presupposed knowledge of the

assumption of isotropy on a sphere. In this paper, a test for spatial isotropy
on a sphere is proposed. The data are first projected onto the set of spherical
harmonic functions. Under isotropy, the spherical harmonic coefficients are
uncorrelated whereas they are correlated if the underlying fields are not
isotropic. This motivates a test based on the sample correlation matrix of the
spherical harmonic coefficients. In particular, we use the largest eigenvalue
of the sample correlation matrix as the test statistic. Extensive simulations
are conducted to assess the Type I errors of the test under different

the possibility of a strong first order EWPT required for baryogenesis and
study its phenomenological implications for the LHC. Like in the CP-conserving
(real) 2HDM (R2HDM) we find that a strong EWPT favours mass gaps between the
non-SM-like Higgs bosons. These lead to prominent final states comprised of
gauge+Higgs bosons or pairs of Higgs bosons. In contrast to the R2HDM, the
CP-mixing of the C2HDM also favours approximately mass degenerate spectra with
dominant decays into SM particles. The requirement of a strong EWPT further
allows us to distinguish the C2HDM from the R2HDM using the signal strengths of
the SM-like Higgs boson. We additionally find that a strong EWPT requires an
enhancement of the SM-like trilinear Higgs coupling at next-to-leading order
(NLO) by up to a factor of 2.4 compared to the NLO SM coupling, establishing
another link between cosmology and collider phenomenology. We provide several
C2HDM benchmark scenarios compatible with a strong EWPT and all experimental
and theoretical constraints. We include the dominant branching ratios of the
non-SM-like Higgs bosons as well as the Higgs pair production cross section of
the SM-like Higgs boson for every benchmark point. The pair production cross
sections can be substantially enhanced compared to the SM and could be

If we think the representation of a number over a base as an infinite sequence

words of symbols of $A$: A word $x$ is normal to the alphabet $A$ if every
finite block of symbols from $A$ appears with the same asymptotic frequency in

select subsequences of a normal word $x$ preserving its normality, always
leaving the alphabet $A$ fixed. In this work we consider the dual problem which

demonstrate the selective excitation of guided modes in waveguides composed of
two kinds of single-negative metamaterials. A localized, circularly polarized
emitter placed near the interface of the two kinds of single-negative
metamaterials only couples with one guided mode with a specific propagating
direction determined by the polarization handedness of the source. Moreover,
this optical spin-orbit locking phenomenon, also called the photonic spin Hall
effect, is robust against interface fluctuations, which may be very useful in
the manipulation of electromagnetic signals.

event GW170817 and the subsequent observation of its electromagnetic

opportunity to study theories of gravity beyond general relativity. An
important outcome of these observations is that they constrain the difference
between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to less than $10^{-15}c$.
Also, the time delay between the arrivals of gravitational waves at different
detectors constrains the speed of gravity at the Earth to be in the range
$0.55c < v_{gw} < 1.42c$. We use these results to constrain a widely studied
modified theory of gravity: Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. We
show that, in EiBI theory, the speed of gravitational waves in matter deviates
from $c$. From the time delay in arrival of gravitational wave signals at
Earth-based detectors, we obtain the bound on the theory parameter $\kappa$ as
$\vert\kappa\vert \lesssim 10^{21}\, m^2$. Similarly, from the time delay
between the signals of GW170817 and GRB 170817A, in a background

These objects were tentatively identified as Rydberg lines of ultra-high
excited metals in ionization stages V-X, indicating line formation in a dense
environment with temperatures near one million Kelvin. Since some features show
blueward extensions, it was argued that they stem from a superionized wind. A
unique assignment of the lines to particular elements is not possible, although
they probably stem from C, N, O, and Ne. To further investigate this
phenomenon, we analyzed the ultraviolet spectra available from only three stars
of this group; that is, two helium-rich white dwarfs, HE 0504-2408 and HS
0713+3958 with spectral type DO, and a hydrogen-rich white dwarf, HS 2115+1148
with spectral type DAO. We identified light metals (C, N, O, Si, P, and S) with
generally subsolar abundances and heavy elements from the iron group (Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni) with solar or oversolar abundance. The abundance patterns are not
unusual for hot WDs and can be interpreted as the result of gravitational
settling and radiative levitation of elements. As to the origin of the
ultra-high ionized metals lines, we discuss the possible presence of a
multicomponent radiatively driven wind that is frictionally heated.

costly resource and most of it is spent on transmitting and receiving messages.
Broadcast is a problem where a message needs to be transmitted from one node to
all other nodes of the network. We study algorithms that can work under limited
energy measured as the maximum number of transmissions by a single station. The
goal of the paper is to study tradeoffs between time and energy complexity of
broadcast problem in multi-hop radio networks. We consider a model where the
topology of the network is unknown and if two neighbors of a station are
transmitting in the same discrete time slot, then the signals collide and the
receiver cannot distinguish the collided signals from silence.
  We observe that existing, time efficient, algorithms are not optimized with
respect to energy expenditure. We then propose and analyse two new randomized
energy-efficient algorithms. Our first algorithm works in time
$O((D+\varphi)\cdot n^{1/\varphi}\cdot \varphi)$ with high probability and uses
$O(\varphi)$ energy per station for any $\varphi \leq \log n/(2\log\log n)$ for
any graph with $n$ nodes and diameter $D$. Our second algorithm works in time
$O((D+\log n)\log n)$ with high probability and uses $O(\log n/\log\log n)$
energy.
  We prove that our algorithms are almost time-optimal for given energy limits
for graphs with constant diameters by constructing lower bound on time of
$\Omega(n^{1/\varphi} \cdot \varphi)$. The lower bound shows also that any
algorithm working in polylogaritmic time in $n$ for all graphs needs energy
$\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$.

many applications such as targeted advertising, community evolution and outlier
detection. In this paper, we present a novel approach, STWalk, for learning
trajectory representations of nodes in temporal graphs. The proposed framework
makes use of structural properties of graphs at current and previous time-steps
to learn effective node trajectory representations. STWalk performs random
walks on a graph at a given time step (called space-walk) as well as on graphs
from past time-steps (called time-walk) to capture the spatio-temporal behavior
of nodes. We propose two variants of STWalk to learn trajectory
representations. In one algorithm, we perform space-walk and time-walk as part
of a single step. In the other variant, we perform space-walk and time-walk
separately and combine the learned representations to get the final trajectory
embedding. Extensive experiments on three real-world temporal graph datasets
validate the effectiveness of the learned representations when compared to
three baseline methods. We also show the goodness of the learned trajectory
embeddings for change point detection, as well as demonstrate that arithmetic
operations on these trajectory representations yield interesting and
interpretable results.

for the optimization of simple pair potentials that minimizes the relative

relative information of a target pair distribution function with respect to an
ansatz distribution function via an iterative update process. During this
process, we filter high frequencies from the Fourier spectrum of the pair

real space, and therefore likely easier to make. We show that pair potentials
obtained by this method assemble their target structure more robustly with

Determining the sources of such variations, often referred to as solar noise,
is of importance for multiple reasons: a) it is the background that limits the
detection of solar oscillations, b) variability in solar brightness is one of
the drivers of the Earth's climate system, c) it is a prototype of stellar
variability which is an important limiting factor for the detection of
extra-solar planets. Here we show that recent progress in simulations and
observations of the Sun makes it finally possible to pinpoint the source of the
solar noise. We utilise high-cadence observations from the Solar Dynamic
Observatory and the SATIRE model to calculate the magnetically-driven
variations of solar brightness. The brightness variations caused by the
constantly evolving cellular granulation pattern on the solar surface are
computed with the MURAM code. We find that surface magnetic field and
granulation can together precisely explain solar noise on timescales from
minutes to decades, i.e. ranging over more than six orders of magnitude in the
period. This accounts for all timescales that have so far been resolved or
covered by irradiance measurements. We demonstrate that no other sources of
variability are required to explain the data. Recent measurements of Sun-like
stars by CoRoT and Kepler uncovered brightness variations similar to that of
the Sun but with much wider variety of patterns. Our finding that solar
brightness variations can be replicated in detail with just two well-known
sources will greatly simplify future modelling of existing CoRoT and Kepler as
well as anticipated TESS and PLATO data.

background. We account for the openness of the resonator exactly by employing a
spectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of
non-Hermitian modes. A well-behaved time domain perturbation theory is derived
to systematically account for the nonlinearity of weakly nonlinear qubits like
transmon. We apply this method to the problem of spontaneous emission,
capturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the qubit dynamics, valid
for any qubit-resonator coupling strength. Any discrete-level quantum system
coupled to the electromagnetic continuum is subject to radiative decay and
renormalization of its energy levels. When inside a cavity, these quantities
can be strongly modified with respect to vacuum. Generally, this modification
can be captured by including only the closest resonant cavity mode. In
circuit-QED architecture, with substantial coupling strengths, it is however
found that such rates are strongly influenced by far off-resonant modes. A
multimode calculation over the infinite set of cavity modes leads to
divergences unless an artificial cutoff is imposed. Previous studies have not
pointed out what the source of this divergence is. We show that unless the
effect of $A^2$ is accounted for up to all orders exactly, any multimode
calculations of circuit-QED quantities is bound to diverge. Subsequently, we
present the calculation of finite radiative corrections to qubit properties

variant of Modal Defeasible Logic (and vice versa) such that a legal statement
represented using LegalRuleML can be transformed into a machine-readable format
that can be understood and reasoned about depending upon the client's
preferences.

particular $f(R)$ models using Newman-Penrose formalism. We find two extra
scalar modes of gravitational wave (longitudinal and transversal modes) in
addition to two tensor modes of general relativity. We conclude that
gravitational waves correspond to class $II_{6}$ under the Lorentz-invariant
E(2) classification of plane null waves for these $f(R)$ models.

improves the uncertainty with respect to the previous measurement of this
quantity by more than a factor of three. Also, the expected precision on $CP$
asymmetry of the $D^0 \rightarrow K^0_S K^0_S$ decay by the Belle II experiment
is presented.

  Language Model",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last couple decades, social network services like Twitter have
generated large volumes of data about users and their interests, providing
meaningful business intelligence so organizations can better understand and
engage their customers. All businesses want to know who is promoting their
products, who is complaining about them, and how are these opinions bringing or
diminishing value to a company. Companies want to be able to identify their
high-value customers and quantify the value each user brings. Many businesses
use social media metrics to calculate the user contribution score, which
enables them to quantify the value that influential users bring on social
media, so the businesses can offer them more differentiated services. However,
the score calculation can be refined to provide a better illustration of a
user's contribution. Using Microsoft Azure as a case study, we conducted
Twitter sentiment analysis to develop a machine learning classification model
that identifies tweet contents and sentiments most illustrative of
positive-value user contribution. Using data mining and AI-powered cognitive
tools, we analyzed factors of social influence and specifically, promotional
language in the developer community. Our predictive model was a combination of
a traditional supervised machine learning algorithm and a custom-developed
natural language model for identifying promotional tweets, that identifies a
product-specific promotion on Twitter with a 90% accuracy rate.

dynamical systems. It can arise from an external forcing or due to random
dynamics internal to the system. It is well established that even weak noise
can result in large behavioral changes such as transitions between or escapes
from quasi-stable states. These transitions can correspond to critical events
such as failures or extinctions that make them essential phenomena to
understand and quantify, despite the fact that their occurrence is rare. This
article will provide an overview of the theory underlying the dynamics of rare
events for stochastic models along with some example applications.
