correcting spurious associations raised by population stratification, family
structures, and cryptic relatedness, more challenges are still to be addressed
regarding the complex structure of genotypic and phenotypic data. For example,
geneticists have discovered that some clusters of phenotypes are more
co-expressed than others. Hence, a joint analysis that can utilize such
relatedness information in a heterogeneous data set is crucial for genetic
modeling.
  We proposed the sparse graph-structured linear mixed model (sGLMM) that can
incorporate the relatedness information from traits in a dataset with
confounding correction. Our method is capable of uncovering the genetic
associations of a large number of phenotypes together while considering the
relatedness of these phenotypes. Through extensive simulation experiments, we
show that the proposed model outperforms other existing approaches and can
model correlation from both population structure and shared signals. Further,
we validate the effectiveness of sGLMM in the real-world genomic dataset on two
different species from plants and humans. In Arabidopsis thaliana data, sGLMM
behaves better than all other baseline models for 63.4% traits. We also discuss
the potential causal genetic variation of Human Alzheimer's disease discovered
by our model and justify some of the most important genetic loci.

flooding in Upper Egypt and Red Sea Coast especially the city of Ras Gharib. In
this work, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used with one
domain of 10-km resolution for three days starting from 26th October 2016 to
simulate this severe rainy event in terms of precipitation, temperature,
pressure and wind speed. In order to use the WRF model several schemes should
be configured, one of them is the microphysics scheme. Microphysics is the
process by which moisture is removed from the air, based on other thermodynamic
and kinematic fields represented within the numerical models. Sensitivity of
ten microphysics schemes were tested (Kessler, Lin, WRF single moment 3 and 5
class, Eta (Ferrier), WRF single Scheme 6 Class, Goddard, Thompson,
Milbrandt-Yau Double Moment and Morrison double moment). The output temperature
and precipitation from the model were compared to the satellite data obtained
from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical
Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), respectively. Our analysis showed that the
model has the capability to simulate the rainy event spatially and produce the
cloud pattern. Three coastal areas were chosen for this study, the city of Ras
Gharib, Wadi Elgemal National park, and Elba National park. The results showed
that the model generally tends to overestimate the precipitation for all the
ten schemes and underestimated temperature compared to TRMM and MODIS data

doped copper oxides, that arise due to doping-induced polarisation of the
oxygen orbitals in the CuO$_2$ planes. The concept of such polarons is
fundamentally different from previous interpretations. The novel aspect of
spin-orbit polarons is best described by electrons becoming self-trapped in
one-dimensional channels created by polarisation of the oxygen orbitals. The
one-dimensional channels form elongated filaments with two possible
orientations, along the diagonals of the elementary CuO$_2$ square plaquette.
As the density of doped electrons increases multiple filaments are formed.
These may condense into a single percollating filamentary phase. Alternatively,
the filaments may cross perpendicularly to create an interconnected conducting
quasi-one-dimensional web. At low electron doping the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
state and the polaron web coexist. As the doping is increased the web of
filaments modifies and transforms the AFM correlations leading to a series of
quantum phase transitions - which affect the normal and superconducting state
properties.

magnetic particles of mesoscopic size in a crosslinked polymeric matrix. They
combine the reversible elastic deformability of polymeric materials with the
high responsivity of ferrofluids to external magnetic fields. These materials
stand out, for example, for large magnetostriction as well as significant
increase of the elastic moduli in the presence of external magnetic fields. By
means of X-ray micro-computed tomography, position and size of each magnetic
particle can be measured with a high degree of accuracy. We here use data
extracted from real magnetoelastic samples as input for coarse-grained
dipole-spring modeling and calculations to investigate magnetostriction,
stiffening, and changes in the normal modes spectrum. More precisely, we assign
to each particle a dipole moment proportional to its volume and set a
randomized network of springs between them that mimics the behavior of the
polymeric elastic matrix. Extending our previously developed methods, we
compute the resulting structural changes in the systems, their overall
distortions, as well as the frequency-dependent elastic moduli when magnetic
interactions are turned on. Particularly, with increasing magnetization, we
observe the formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in significant
overall deformations. Interestingly, the static elastic moduli can first show a
slight decrease with growing amplitude of the magnetic interactions, before a
pronounced increase appears upon the chain formation. The change of the dynamic
moduli with increasing magnetization depends on the frequency and can even show
nonmonotonic behavior. Overall, we demonstrate how theory and experiments can
complement each other to learn more about the dynamic behavior of this
interesting class of materials.

singularities, regular points and points at infinity, is an unexpectedly subtle
one. Due to the fact that whether or not two boundary points are identified or
even ""nearby"" is dependant on the way the space-time is embedded, difficulties
occur when singularities are thought of as an inherently local aspect of a
space-time, as an analogy with electromagnetism would imply. The completion of
a manifold with respect to a pseudo-Riemannian metric can be defined

which boundary sets cover other sets. This paper works through the
possibilities, providing examples to show that all covering relations not

out-of-date in their treatment of blackbody radiation within classical physics.
Relativistic classical electrodynamics including classical electromagnetic
zero-point radiation gives the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation as the
blackbody radiation spectrum. In contrast, nonrelativistic mechanics cannot
support the idea of zero-point energy; therefore if nonrelativistic classical
statistical mechanics or nonrelativistic mechanical scatterers are invoked for
radiation equilibrium, one arrives at only the low-frequency Rayleigh-Jeans
part of the spectrum which involves no zero-point energy, and does not include
the high-frequency part of the spectrum involving relativistically-invariant
classical zero-point radiation. Here we first discuss the correct understanding
of blackbody radiation within relativistic classical physics, and then we
review the historical treatment. Finally, we point out how the presence of
Lorentz-invariant classical zero-point radiation and the use of relativistic

the BLFS. In this approach, we may not only select the features that are most
related to a variable Y, but also select the values of the features that most
influence the variable or that are most prone to have a specific value of Y. A
local formulation of Shanon's mutual information is applied on a CBLOP to
select features, namely, the Local Lift Dependence Scale, an scale for
measuring variable dependence in multiple resolutions. The main contribution of
this paper is to define and apply this local measure, which permits to analyse
local properties of joint distributions that are neglected by the classical
Shanon's global measure. The proposed approach is applied to a dataset
consisting of student performances on a university entrance exam, as well as on
undergraduate courses. The approach is also applied to two datasets of the UCI
Machine Learning Repository.

Providers (ISPs) which users can switch easily and freely between their ISPs.
In order to increase the QoS of the ISPs, we propose a two class service model
as the following. ISPs divide their available bandwidth into two parts to
provide their end users with optimal services. One dedicated to primary users,
and the other for secondary users. Primary users are those who pay more and
thus, expect dedicated bandwidth that is always available. Secondary services
are provided by ISPs for the other users who cannot afford the dedicated
bandwidth. In this study, by defining the utility functions for both user
types, we aim at dividing the ISP bandwidth between these two services such
that the utility function of the users is maximized. Since the primary users do
not always use the maximum bandwidth, an algorithm is proposed for ISPs to
estimate the primary users required bandwidth in each time segment based on the
previous segments. Based on this estimate, the expected bandwidth is dedicated
to the primary users, and the remaining bandwidth is devoted to the secondary
users to improve the Quality of Service (QoS). On the other hand, an ISP is
penalized if it fails to provide the primary users with the required bandwidth
mentioned in their contract. Therefore, there exists a trade-off between the
conservative estimation of the primary users rate, QoS of the secondary users
and the achieved utility of the ISPs.

clear picture of the SgrAWF. While the physical association of the SgrAWF with
SgrA* is not unambiguous, the images decidedly evoke this interesting
possibility. Assuming that the SgrAWF bears a physical relationship to SgrA*,
we examine the potential implications. One is that SgrA* is a source of
relativistic particles constrained to diffuse along ordered local field lines.
The relativistic particles could also be fed into the local field by a
collimated outflow from SgrA*, perhaps driven by the Poynting flux accompanying
the black hole spin in the presence of a magnetic field threading the event
horizon. Second, we consider the possibility that the SgrAWF is the
manifestation of a low-mass-density cosmic string that has become anchored to
the black hole. The simplest form of these hypotheses would predict that the
filament be bi-directional, whereas the SgrAWF is only seen on one side of
SgrA*, perhaps because of the dynamics of the local medium.

imbalances the electron count and results in layered metals characterized by
relatively high carrier mobilities and bulk two-dimensional Fermi surfaces

Intriguingly, slab electronic structure calculations predict Dirac-like surface

to estimating variable distribution based on the data sampling (bagging), which
can be interpreted as finding solutions (variable distribution approximation)
directly from sampled data space. However, this methodology fails to account
for the variations existed in the data. In this paper, we introduce an
intermediate step -- solution sampling -- after the data sampling step to form
a subspace, in which an optimal solution can be estimated. More specifically,
we propose a new method, named latent constrained correlation filters (LCCF),
by mapping the correlation filters to a given latent subspace, and develop a
new learning framework in the latent subspace that embeds distribution-related
constraints into the original problem. To solve the optimization problem, we
introduce a subspace based alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM),
which is proven to converge at the saddle point. Our approach is successfully
applied to three different tasks, including eye localization, car detection and
object tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LCCF outperforms the

for virtual characters in real-time, using data from a single inertial
measurement unit (IMU). This process can be characterized by its difficulty
because of the need to reconstruct a high number of degrees of freedom (DOFs)
from a very low number of DOFs. To solve such a complex problem, the presented
method is divided into several steps. The user's full-body locomotion and the
IMU's data are recorded simultaneously. Then, the data is preprocessed in such
a way that would be handled more efficiently. By developing a hierarchical
multivariate hidden Markov model with reactive interpolation functionality the
system learns the structure of the motion sequences. Specifically, the phases
of the locomotion sequence are assigned in the higher hierarchical level, and
the frame structure of the motion sequences are assigned at the lower
hierarchical level. During the runtime of the method, the forward algorithm is
used for reconstructing the full-body motion of a virtual character. Firstly,
the method predicts the phase where the input motion belongs (higher
hierarchical level). Secondly, the method predicts the closest trajectories and
their progression and interpolates the most probable of them to reconstruct the
virtual character's full-body motion (lower hierarchical level). Evaluating the
proposed method shows that it works on reasonable framerates and minimizes the
reconstruction errors compared with previous approaches.

Reynolds Numbers ($0.1\le Re_p \le 10$). We report the distribution of solid
and fluid phase velocity and solid volume fraction and show that close to the
boundaries inertial effects result in a significant slip velocity between the
solid and fluid phase. The local solid volume fraction profiles indicate
particle layering close to the walls, which increases with the nominal $\Phi$.
This feature is associated with the confinement effects. We calculate the
probability density function of local strain rates and compare their mean value
with the values estimated from the homogenization theory of \cite{Chateau08},
indicating a reasonable agreement in the Stokesian regimes. Both the mean value
and standard deviation of the local strain rates increase primarily with the
solid volume fraction and secondarily with the $Re_p$. The wide spectrum of the
local shear rate and its dependency on $\Phi$ and $Re_p$ points to the
deficiencies of the mean value of the local shear rates in estimating the
rheology of these noncolloidal complex suspensions. Finally, we show that in
the presence of inertia, the effective viscosity of these noncolloidal
suspensions deviates from that of Stokesian suspensions. We discuss how inertia
affects the microstructure and provide a scaling argument to give a closure for
the suspension shear stress for both Newtonian and power-law suspending fluids.

such operator on the orbit space, a Thom-Mather stratified space with one
singular stratum of positive dimension, and we show that it is essentially
unique and that its index coincides with Lott's signature, at least when the
stratified space satisfies the so called Witt condition. We call this operator
the induced Dirac-Schr\""odinger operator. The strategy of the construction is
to ""push down"" an appropriate $S^1$-invariant first order transversally
elliptic operator to the quotient space. The Witt condition, a topological
condition which in this case depends on the codimension of the fixed point set,
has various analytic consequences. In particular, when not satisfied, the
Hodge-de Rham operator on the quotient space does not need to be essentially
self-adjoint and therefore a choice of boundary conditions is required. This
choice freedom is not natural in view of the fact that Lott's signature is well
defined independently of the Witt condition. The Dirac-Schr\""odinger operator
constructed in this Thesis differs from the Hodge-de Rham operator by a zero
order term which ensures it to be essentially self-adjoint. Moreover, this zero
order term anti-commutes with the chirality involution allowing the whole

including their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. Heavy
fractions in petroleum fluids are discussed and their main families of
constituents are presented including petroleum wax, diamondoids, asphaltenes
and petroleum resins. Then the generalized petroleum fluids phase behavior is
discussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. The effects of
variations of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of
petroleum fluids are introduced. Finally eleven distinct phase-transition
points of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation with state

that in certain cases the difference is negligible despite the heaters being

resistance depends on the heater geometry using analytical solutions of the

play the key role in setting the thermal resistance rather than any single

quasiballistic regime is no different than the Fourier prediction. We also
demonstrate that the spectral distribution of the heat source also plays a
major role in the resulting transport, unlike in the diffusion regime. Our work

precondition to understanding computations within the brain, a field still in

SNNs enables bio-inspired networks to recognize patterns of stimuli through
hierarchical feature acquisition. Although gradient descent has shown
impressive performance in multi-layer (and deep) SNNs, it is generally not

paper proposes a novel supervised learning approach based on an event-based
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule embedded in a network of
integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons. The proposed temporally local learning rule
follows the backpropagation weight change updates applied at each time step.
This approach enjoys benefits of both accurate gradient descent and temporally
local, efficient STDP. Thus, this method is able to address some open questions
regarding accurate and efficient computations that occur in the brain. The
experimental results on the XOR problem, the Iris data, and the MNIST dataset

dependent $\mu$ for solid samples of pressure 3.6 (5.4) MPa. The decrements
indicate that the probability of pinning of $^3$He on dislocation segment, $G$,
decreases by several orders of magnitude. We propose that the motion of $^3$He
impuritons under rotation becomes strongly anisotropic by the Coriolis force,
resulting a decrease in $G$ for dislocation lines aligning parallel to the
rotation axis.

First-principles calculations reveal that the electronic band structure is like

up to $x = $0.2 in Mn$_{2}$CoAl$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$. This means that the Si
substitution enables the Fermi level shift without largely changing the
electronic structures in Mn$_{2}$CoAl. By using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
techniques, Mn$_{2}$CoAl$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$ epitaxial films can be grown, leading
to the systematic control of $x$ (0 $\le$ $x$ $\le$ 0.3). In addition to the
electrical conductivity, the values of $\sigma$$_{\rm AHC}$ for the
Mn$_{2}$CoAl$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$ films are similar to those in Mn$_{2}$CoAl films
shown in previous reports. We note that a very small $\sigma$$_{\rm AHC}$ of
$\sim$ 1.1 S/cm is obtained for $x =$ 0.225 and the sign of $\sigma$$_{\rm
AHC}$ is changed from positive to negative at around $x =$ 0.25. We discuss the
origin of the sign reversal of $\sigma$$_{\rm AHC}$ as a consequence of the
Fermi level shift in MCA. Considering the presence of the structural disorder
in the Mn$_{2}$CoAl$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$ films, we can conclude that the small value

vision due to its various applications. Despite the enduring research of
several decades on optical character recognition (OCR), recognizing texts from

often in irregular (e.g. curved, arbitrarily-oriented or seriously distorted)
arrangements, which have not yet been well addressed in the literature.
Existing methods on text recognition mainly work with regular (horizontal and
frontal) texts and cannot be trivially generalized to handle irregular texts.
In this paper, we develop the arbitrary orientation network (AON) to directly
capture the deep features of irregular texts, which are combined into an
attention-based decoder to generate character sequence. The whole network can
be trained end-to-end by using only images and word-level annotations.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the CUTE80,
SVT-Perspective, IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the proposed
AON-based method achieves the-state-of-the-art performance in irregular
datasets, and is comparable to major existing methods in regular datasets.

not limited just by its self-contained description of the gauge nature of

selecting a gauge only once throughout the whole evolution of a gravitational

paper we consider gravitational theories which arise from deformations of the
fundamental canonical variables of general relativity where the proposed
deformations are inspired by modifications of gravity. These variable
deformations result in new theories when the deformation is not a canonical

samples come from a nominal distribution or an unknown distribution that is
different from the nominal distribution. Hoeffding's test, whose test statistic
is equivalent to the empirical Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), is known to
be asymptotically optimal for distributions defined on finite alphabets. With
continuous observations, however, the discontinuity of the KLD in the
distribution functions results in significant complications for universal
hypothesis testing. This paper introduces a robust version of the classical
KLD, defined as the KLD from a distribution to the L'evy ball of a known
distribution. This robust KLD is shown to be continuous in the underlying
distribution function with respect to the weak convergence. The continuity
property enables the development of a universal hypothesis test for continuous
observations that is shown to be asymptotically optimal for continuous
distributions in the same sense as that of the Hoeffding's test for discrete

  This document presents a research agenda aiming at laying the foundations of

distributed systems without making fairness assumptions. This theory will
encompass process algebra, temporal logic and semantic models, as well as
treatments of real-time. The agenda also includes developing a methodology that

verification of realistic distributed systems, including routing protocols for
wireless networks.
  Contemporary process algebras and temporal logics fail to make distinctions
between systems of which one has a crucial liveness property and the other does
not, at least when assuming justness, a strong progress property, but not
assuming fairness. Setting up an alternative framework involves giving up on
identifying strongly bisimilar systems, inventing new induction principles,
developing new axiomatic bases for process algebras and new congruence formats
for operational semantics, and creating new treatments of time and probability.
  Even simple systems like fair schedulers or mutual exclusion protocols cannot
be accurately specified in standard process algebras (or Petri nets) in the
absence of fairness assumptions. Hence the work involves the study of adequate

cache-miss obliviousness which requires the cache-misses emitted during an
enclave execution are oblivious to sensitive data. This work realizes the
cache-miss obliviousness for the computation of data shuffling. The proposed
approach is to software-engineer the oblivious algorithm of Melbourne shuffle
on the Intel SGX/TSX architecture, where the Transaction Synchronization
eXtension (TSX) is (ab)used to detect the occurrence of cache misses. In the
system building, we propose software techniques to prefetch memory data prior
to the TSX transaction to defend the physical bus-tapping attacks. Our
evaluation based on real implementation shows that our system achieves superior
performance and lower transaction abort rate than the related work in the

of the Dirac equation in a curved Riemann-Cartan spacetime with torsion, the
presence of non-vanishing torsion is implied by the intrinsic spin-1/2 of the
Dirac field. We then demonstrate how the inversion leads to a reformulation of
the fully non-linear and self-interactive Einstein-Cartan-Dirac field equations
in terms of Dirac bilinears. It has been known for some decades that the Dirac
equation for charged fermions interacting with an electromagnetic field can be
algebraically inverted, so as to obtain an explicit rational expression of the
four-vector potential of the gauge field in terms of the spinors. Substitution
of this expression into Maxwell's equations yields the bilinear form of the
self-interactive Maxwell-Dirac equations. In the present (purely gravitational)
case, the inversion process yields \emph{two} rational four-vector expressions
in terms of Dirac bilinears, which act as gravitational analogues of the
electromagnetic vector potential. These ""potentials"" also appear as irreducible
summand components of the connection, along with a traceless residual term of
mixed symmetry. When taking the torsion field equation into account, the
residual term can be written as a function of the object of anholonomity. Using
the local tetrad frame associated with observers co-moving with the Dirac
matter, a generic vierbein frame can described in terms of four Dirac bilinear
vector fields, normalized by a scalar and pseudoscalar field. A corollary of
this is that in regions where the Dirac field is non-vanishing, the
self-coupled Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations can in principle be expressed in
terms of Dirac bilinears only.

images. Bias field noise is one example of such a distortion that is often
present in the magnetic resonance (MR) images or other modalities such as
retina images. In this paper, we first show that the bias field noise can be
considerably reduced using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique. EMD is
a multi-resolution tool that decomposes a signal into several principle
patterns and residual components. We show that the spatially-varying noise is
highly expressed in the residual component of the EMD and could be filtered
out. Then, we propose two hierarchical multi-resolution EMD-based algorithms
for robust registration of images in the presence of spatially varying noise.
One algorithm (LR-EMD) is based on registration of EMD feature-maps from both
floating and reference images in various resolution levels. In the second
algorithm (AFR-EMD), we first extract an average feature-map based on EMD from
both floating and reference images. Then, we use a simple hierarchical
multi-resolution algorithm to register the average feature-maps. For the brain
MR images, both algorithms achieve lower error rate and higher convergence
percentage compared to the intensity-based hierarchical registration.
Specifically, using mutual information as the similarity measure, AFR-EMD
achieves 42% lower error rate in intensity and 52% lower error rate in
transformation compared to intensity-based hierarchical registration. For
LR-EMD, the error rate is 32% lower for the intensity and 41% lower for the
transformation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms
improve the registration of retina images in the presence of spatially varying

co-referent event sequences contain no common items at all. LDA-Link is built
upon ""Split-Document"" model, a new mixed-membership probabilistic model for the

Majorana neutrinos are an irrefutable proof of physics beyond the Standard
Model. Neutrinoless double electron capture is not a process but a virtual
$\Delta L=2$ mixing between a parent $^AZ$ atom and a daughter $^A(Z-2)$
excited atom with two electron holes. As a mixing between two neutral atoms and
the observable signal in terms of emitted two-hole X-rays, the strategy,
experimental signature and background are different from neutrinoless double
beta decay. The mixing is resonantly enhanced for almost degeneracy and, under
these conditions, there is no irreducible background from the standard
two-neutrino channel. We reconstruct the natural time history of a nominally
stable parent atom since its production either by nature or in the laboratory.
After the time periods of atom oscillations and the decay of the short-lived
daughter atom, at observable times the relevant ""stationary"" states are the
mixed metastable long-lived state and the short-lived excited state, as well as
the ground state of the daughter atom. Their natural population inversion is
most appropriate for exploiting the bosonic nature of the observed X-rays by
means of stimulating X-ray beams. Among different observables of the atom
Majorana mixing, we include the enhanced rate of stimulated X-ray emission from
the long-lived metastable state by a high-intensity X-ray beam. A gain factor
of 100 can be envisaged in a facility like European XFEL.

calling for an explanation. Within the framework of the kinetic-energy driven
superconducting mechanism, the complicated line-shape in the electron

It is shown that the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin
excitations generates a notable peak structure in the electron quasiparticle
scattering rate around the antinodal and nodal regions. However, this peak
structure disappears at the hot spots, which leads to that the striking
peak-dip-hump structure is developed around the antinodal and nodal regions,
and vanishes at the hot spots. The theory also confirms that the sharp peak

Most traditional
spectral clustering algorithms work in three separate steps: similarity graph
construction; continuous labels learning; discretizing the learned labels by
k-means clustering. Such common practice has two potential flaws, which may
lead to severe information loss and performance degradation. First, predefined
similarity graph might not be optimal for subsequent clustering. It is
well-accepted that similarity graph highly affects the clustering results. To
this end, we propose to automatically learn similarity information from data
and simultaneously consider the constraint that the similarity matrix has exact
c connected components if there are c clusters. Second, the discrete solution
may deviate from the spectral solution since k-means method is well-known as
sensitive to the initialization of cluster centers. In this work, we transform
the candidate solution into a new one that better approximates the discrete
one. Finally, those three subtasks are integrated into a unified framework,
with each subtask iteratively boosted by using the results of the others
towards an overall optimal solution. It is known that the performance of a
kernel method is largely determined by the choice of kernels. To tackle this
practical problem of how to select the most suitable kernel for a particular
data set, we further extend our model to incorporate multiple kernel learning
ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed

computer vision for many years. Compared to tracking with a still camera, the
images captured with a PTZ camera are highly dynamic in nature because the
camera can perform large motion resulting in quickly changing capture
conditions. Furthermore, tracking with a PTZ camera involves camera control to
position the camera on the target. For successful tracking and camera control,
the tracker must be fast enough, or has to be able to predict accurately the
next position of the target. Therefore, standard benchmarks do not allow to
assess properly the quality of a tracker for the PTZ scenario. In this work, we
use a virtual PTZ framework to evaluate different tracking algorithms and
compare their performances. We also extend the framework to add target position
prediction for the next frame, accounting for camera motion and processing
delays. By doing this, we can assess if predicting can make long-term tracking
more robust as it may help slower algorithms for keeping the target in the
field of view of the camera. Results confirm that both speed and robustness are
required for tracking under the PTZ scenario.

that ends at senescence? We consider the question ""can the cell's perception of
time be expressed through the length of the shortest telomere?"" The answer is
that the absolute time before senescence cannot be expressed by the telomere's
length and that a cell can survive many more divisions than intuitively
expected. This apparent paradox is due to shortening and elongation of the
telomere, which suggests a random walk model of the telomere's length. The
model indicates two phases, first, a determinist drift of the length toward a
quasi-equilibrium state, and second, persistence of the length near an
attracting state for the majority of divisions prior to senescence. The measure
of stability of the latter phase is the expected number of divisions at the
attractor (""lifetime"") prior to crossing a threshold to senescence. The
telomerase regulates stability by creating an effective potential barrier that
separates statistically the shortest lifetime from the next shortest. The
random walk has to overcome the barrier in order to extend the range of the
first regime. The model explains how random telomere dynamics underlies the
extension of cell survival time.

The true
model of the MRF is unknown, and it is assumed to belong to a binary set. The
objective is to sequentially sample the random variables (one-at-a-time) such
that the true MRF model can be detected with the fewest number of samples,
while in parallel, the decision reliability is controlled. The core element of
an optimal decision process is a rule for selecting and sampling the random
variables over time. Such a process, at every time instant and adaptively to
the collected data, selects the random variable that is expected to be most
informative about the model, rendering an overall minimized number of samples
required for reaching a reliable decision. The existing studies on detecting
MRF structures generally sample the entire network at the same time and focus
on designing optimal detection rules without regard to the data-acquisition
process. This paper characterizes the sampling process for general MRFs, which,
in conjunction with the sequential probability ratio test, is shown to be
optimal in the asymptote of large $n$. The critical insight in designing the
sampling process is devising an information measure that captures the
decisions' inherent statistical dependence over time. Furthermore, when the
MRFs can be modeled by acyclic probabilistic graphical models, the sampling
rule is shown to take a computationally simple form. Performance analysis for
the general case is provided, and the results are interpreted in several
special cases: Gaussian MRFs, non-asymptotic regimes, connection to Chernoff's
rule to controlled (active) sensing, and the problem of cluster detection.

equivalence may occur when the size of the graph tends to infinity, signalled
by a non-zero specific relative entropy of the two ensembles. In this paper we
analyse a formula for the relative entropy of generic discrete random
structures recently conjectured by Squartini and Garlaschelli. We consider the
case of a random graph with a given degree sequence (configuration model), and
show that in the dense regime this formula correctly predicts that the specific
relative entropy is determined by the scaling of the determinant of the matrix
of canonical covariances of the constraints. The formula also correctly
predicts that an extra correction term is required in the sparse regime and in
the ultra-dense regime. We further show that the different expressions
correspond to the degrees in the canonical ensemble being asymptotically
Gaussian in the dense regime and asymptotically Poisson in the sparse regime
(the latter confirms what we found in earlier work), and the dual degrees in
the canonical ensemble being asymptotically Poisson in the ultra-dense regime.
In general, we show that the degrees follow a multivariate version of the
Poisson-Binomial distribution in the canonical ensemble.

localized and except in the neighborhood of the rear stagnation point, behave
like a linear perturbation of the inviscid flow. Our theory gives a highly
accurate description of these modifications by including the contribution from
the most significant viscous term in a correctional perturbation expansion
about an inviscid base state. We derive the boundary layer equation for the
flow and deduce a similarity transformation that leads to a set of infinite,
shear-free-condition-incompatible, self-similar solutions. By suitably
combining members from this set, we construct an
all-boundary-condition-compatible solution to the boundary layer equation. We
derive the governing equation for vorticity transport through the narrow wake
region and determine its closed-form solution. The near and far field forms of
our wake solution are desirably consistent with the boundary layer solution and
the well-known, self-similar planar wake solution, respectively. We analyze the
flow in the rear stagnation region by formulating an elliptic partial
integro-differential equation for the distortion streamfunction that
specifically accounts for the fully nonlinear and inviscid dynamics of the
viscous correctional terms. The drag force and its atypical logarithmic
dependence on Reynolds number, deduced from our matched asymptotic analysis,
are in remarkable agreement with the high-resolution simulation results. The
logarithmic dependence gives rise to a critical Reynolds number below which the
viscous correction term, counterintuitively, reduces the net dissipation in the
flow field.

generation of solar radio zebras. In the plasma, consisting of the loss-cone
type distribution of hot electrons and much denser and colder background
plasma, this instability generates the upper-hybrid waves, which are then
transformed into the electromagnetic waves and observed as radio zebras. In the
present paper we numerically study the double plasma resonance instability from
the point of view of the zebra interpretation. We use a 3-dimensional
electromagnetic particle-in-cell (3-D PIC) relativistic model. First using the
multi-mode model, we study details of the double plasma resonance instability.
We show how the distribution function of hot electrons changes during this
instability. Then we show that there is a very good agreement between results
obtained by the multi-mode and specific-mode models, which is caused by a
dominance of the wave with the maximal growth rate. Therefore, for computations
in a broad range of model parameters, we use the specific-mode model. We
compute the maximal growth rates of the double plasma resonance instability.
The results are compared with the analytical ones. We find a very good
agreement between numerical and analytical growth rates. We also compute
saturation energies of the upper-hybrid waves in a very broad range of
parameters. We find that the saturation energies of the upper-hybrid waves show
maxima and minima at almost the same values of
$\omega_\mathrm{UH}/\omega_\mathrm{ce}$ as the growth rates. Furthermore, we
find that the saturation energy of the upper-hybrid waves is proportional to
the density of hot electrons. The maximum saturated energy can be up to one
percent of the kinetic energy of hot electrons. All these findings can be used
in the interpretation of solar radio zebras.

superfluid phase. However, the spin nematic (singlet) formation is restricted
upto the first (second) MI lobes for the former one, while there is neither any
asymmetry nor spin nematic (singlet) formation is observed for the later case.
The results are confirmed after carefully scrutinizing the spin eigen value and
spin nematic order parameter for both the cases. On the other hand, for an
attractive three body interaction, the third MI lobe is predominantly affected,
where it completely engulfs the second and the fourth MI lobes at large values
of the interaction strength. Albeit no significant change is observed beyond
the fourth MI lobe. In the ferromagnetic case, the phase diagram shows similar
features as that of a scalar Bose gas. We have compared our results on the MFA
phase diagrams for both types of the interaction potential via a perturbation
expansion in both the cases.

the storage, bandwidth, and compute requirements increased. This means that
with a non-distributed approach, even when using the most high-density server
available, the training process may take weeks, making it prohibitive.
Furthermore, as datasets grow, the representation learning potential of deep
networks grows as well by using more complex models. This synchronicity
triggers a sharp increase in the computational requirements and motivates us to
explore the scaling behaviour on petaflop scale supercomputers. In this paper
we will describe the challenges and novel solutions needed in order to train

deformability of the merging objects. From this constraint, deep insights can
be obtained in compact star equation of states, which has been one of the most
puzzling problems for nuclear physicists and astrophysicists. Employing one of
the most widely-used quark star EOS model, we characterize the star properties
by the strange quark mass ($m_s$), an effective bag constant ($B_{\rm eff}$),
the perturbative QCD correction ($a_4$), as well as the gap parameter
($\Delta$) when considering quark pairing, and investigate the dependences of
the tidal deformablity on them. We find that the tidal deformability is
dominated by $B_{\rm eff}$, and insensitive to $m_s$, $a_4$. We discuss the
correlation between the tidal deformability and the maximum mass
($M_\mathrm{TOV}$) of a static quark star, which allows the model possibility
to rule out the existence of quark stars with future gravitational wave
observations and mass measurements. The current tidal deformability measurement
implies $M_\mathrm{TOV} \le2.18\,M_\odot$ ($2.32\,M_\odot$ when pairing is
considered) for quark stars. Combining with two-solar-mass pulsar observations,
we also make constraints on the poorly known gap parameter $\Delta$ for
color-flavor-locked quark matter.

in M32 and NGC205, while those in NGC5102 and NGC5206 are estimated for the

handful of galaxies with dynamically measured sub-million $M_{\odot}$ central
BHs. Combining these BH detections with our recent work on NGC404's BH, we find
that 80\% (4/5) of nearby, low-mass ($10^9-10^{10}~M_{\odot}$;

of the remnants, most likely from the first generation of massive stars. We
find dynamical masses of the NSCs ranging from $2-80\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ and
compare these masses to scaling relations for NSCs based primarily on

3D shape inverse rendering from a single 2D input image. The main structure of
proposed framework consists of unsupervised pre-trained components which
significantly reduce the need to labeled data for training the whole framework.
using labeled data has the advantage of achieving to accurate results without
the need to predefined assumptions about image formation process. Three main
components are used in the proposed network: an encoder which maps 2D input
image to a representation space, a 3D decoder which decodes a representation to
a 3D structure and a mapping component in order to map 2D to 3D representation.
The only part that needs label for training is the mapping part with not too
many parameters. The other components in the network can be pre-trained
unsupervised using only 2D images or 3D data in each case. The way of
reconstructing 3D shapes in the decoder component, inspired by the model based
methods for 3D reconstruction, maps a low dimensional representation to 3D
shape space with the advantage of extracting the basis vectors of shape space
from training data itself and is not restricted to a small set of examples as
used in predefined models. Therefore, the proposed framework deals directly
with coordinate values of the point cloud representation which leads to achieve
dense 3D shapes in the output. The experimental results on several benchmark
datasets of objects and human faces and comparing with recent similar methods
shows the power of proposed network in recovering more details from single 2D

frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. The existing methods usually exploit hidden sparsity under a
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) basis to estimate the cdownlink channel.
However, there are at least two shortcomings of these DFT-based methods: 1)
they are applicable to uniform linear arrays (ULAs) only, since the DFT basis
requires a special structure of ULAs, and 2) they always suffer from a
performance loss due to the leakage of energy over some DFT bins. To deal with
the above shortcomings, we introduce an off-grid model for downlink channel
sparse representation with arbitrary 2D-array antenna geometry, and propose an
efficient sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) approach for the sparse channel
recovery and off-grid refinement. The main idea of the proposed off-grid method
is to consider the sampled grid points as adjustable parameters. Utilizing an
in-exact block majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, the grid points are
refined iteratively to minimize the off-grid gap. Finally, we further extend
the solution to uplink-aided channel estimation by exploiting the angular
reciprocity between downlink and uplink channels, which brings enhanced
recovery performance.
