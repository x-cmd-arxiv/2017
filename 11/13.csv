multilayers encompassing chitosan and graphene oxide (GO) platelets capable of
improving the flame retardant properties open cell PU foams. The LbL assembly
follows a linear growth regime as evaluated by infrared spectroscopy and yields
a multilayer structure where GO platelets are embedded within a chitosan
continuous matrix. 3 and 6 bi-layers (BL) can efficiently coat the complex 3D
structure of the foam and substantially improve its flame retardant properties.
3BL only add 10% to the original mass and can suppress the melt dripping during
flammability and reduce both the peak of heat release rate by 54% and the total
smoke released by 59% in forced combustion tests. Unprecedented among other LbL
assemblies employed for FR purposes, the deposition 6BL is capable of slowing
down the release of combustible volatile to the limits of non-ignitability thus
preventing ignition in half of the specimens during cone calorimetry tests.
This has been ascribed to the formation of a protective coating where the
thermally stable char produced by chitosan serves as a continuous matrix
embedding GO platelets, which control volatile release while mechanically
sustaining the PU foam structure.

apply the statement to random dynamical systems on the interval given by a
deterministic map $T$ with additive noise (distributed according to a bounded
variation kernel). We prove linear response for these systems, also providing
explicit formulas both for deterministic perturbations of the map $% T$ and for
changes in the noise kernel. The response holds with mild assumptions on the

two very strong phonon polaritons bands where the permittivity becomes

optical properties, thin h-BN flakes support guided modes which have been
observed experimentally both via far field and near field methods. In this
work, we show how selectively excite the more confined modes in the RS1 and RS2

tens and hundreds of times slower than the speed of light. We also show the
possibility of full hyperspectral nano-imaging of modes in RS1 band by means of

two-Higgs doublet models (THDMs), multiple-Higgs doublet models and Higgs

as high as $10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ for masses of the new scalar bosons in the 200

On the other hand, the most promising scenario for a nonvanishing WEDM is
offered by a $CP$-violating THDM in a scenario where the heavy neutral scalar
bosons are a mixture of $CP$ eigenstates. It is found that the real part of
$d_\tau^W$ is of the order of $10^{-24}$ ecm and its imaginary part can reach
the $10^{-26}$ ecm level for masses of the new scalar bosons of the order of a
few hundred of GeVs. Both the tau AWMDM and WEDM decrease dramatically as the

demonstrate that the representations learned by the joint training are more

$\mathcal{W}$ is Gaussian white noise, $L$ is a second-order differential
operator, and $\beta>0$ is a parameter that determines the smoothness of $u$.
However, this approach has been limited to the case $2\beta\in\mathbb{N}$,

dissipation is fundamentally limited. Reversible logic gates can provide an
energy-efficient alternative since they can operate with reversible processes
that have no dissipation, such as with scattering processes involving elastic
particles. The presented logic uses fluxons, topological solitons in Long
Josephson Junctions (LJJs), as inputs into and outputs from logic gates. An
advantage of using LJJs for connections is that they restrict scattering to 1D
paths, in contrast to previous ballistic logic which is based on 2D scattering.
Furthermore, we find through simulation that there is almost no energy loss in
the scattering of fluxons between LJJs of designed unpowered circuit gates. To
switch bit states, the fluxons are made to change polarity during operations --
fluxons in an input LJJ freely propagate into the gate circuit, excite a
nonlinear oscillatory interface mode, and quickly scatter deterministically to
an output LJJ as a fluxon or antifluxon. The numerically simulated soliton
dynamics shows that over $97\%$ of the total energy is preserved as fluxon
energy after gate operations. These phenomena are further analyzed with a
collective coordinate ansatz, reducing the dynamics of many degrees of freedom
to two coordinates which characterize fluxon and antifluxon type excitations in
the input and the output LJJs. The solutions of the reduced model accurately
describe the four possible energy-conserving scattering processes found in
simulations of one-bit gate circuits (with two scattering directions and two
output polarities). Calculated parameter tolerances indicate that the gates can
be manufactured and tested. Results are shown for 1-bit gates as well as a
fundamental 2-bit gate.

which mostly employ deterministic differential equations. The analytical
properties of deterministic models are always of particular interest by many
experts, but their validity - if they can indeed track some empirical data - is
an increasing demand by many practitioners. In this view, the data can tell to
which figure the solutions yielded from the models should be; they drift all
the involving parameters towards the most appropriate values. By prior
understanding of the population dynamics, some parameters with inherently
constant values can be estimated forthwith; some others can sensibly be
guessed. However, solutions from such models using sets of constant parameters
most likely exhibit, if not smoothness, at least noise-free behavior; whereas
the data appear very random in nature. Therefore, some parameters cannot be
constant as the solutions to seemingly appear in a high correlation with the
data. We were aware of impracticality to solve a deterministic model many times
that exhaust all trials of the parameters, or to run its stochastic version
with Monte Carlo strategy that also appeals for a high number of solving
processes. We were also aware that those aforementioned non-constant parameters
can potentially have particular relationships with several extrinsic factors,
such as meteorology and socioeconomics of the human population. We then study
an estimation of time-space-varying parameters within the framework of
variational calculus and investigate how some parameters are related to some
extrinsic factors. Numerical results for some examples with real data are shown

the usage of a host compartment, inside of which the replicator express
phenotypic compounds necessary to carry out its genetic replication. For
example, viruses infect cells, where they express their own proteins and
replicate. In this process, the host cell boundary limits the diffusion of the
viral protein products, thereby ensuring that phenotypic compounds, such as
proteins, promote the replication of the genes that encoded them. This role of
maintaining spatial co-localization, also called genotype-phenotype linkage, is
a critical function of compartments in natural selection. In most cases
however, individual replicating elements do not distribute systematically among
the hosts, but are randomly partitioned. Depending on the replicator-to-host
ratio, more than one variant may thus occupy some compartments, blurring the
genotype-phenotype linkage and affecting the effectiveness of natural
selection. We derive selection equations for a variety of such random multiple
occupancy situations, in particular considering the effect of replicator
population polymorphism and internal replication dynamics. We conclude that the
deleterious effect of random multiple occupancy on selection is relatively
benign, and may even completely vanish is some specific cases. In addition,
given that higher mean occupancy allows larger populations to be channeled
through the selection process, and thus provide a better exploration of
phenotypic diversity, we show that it may represent a valid strategy in both
natural and technological cases.

k-groups, based on energy distance between samples. The energy distance
clustering criterion assigns observations to clusters according to a
multi-sample energy statistic that measures the distance between distributions.
The energy distance determines a consistent test for equality of distributions,
and it is based on a population distance that characterizes equality of
distributions. The k-groups procedure therefore generalizes the k-means method,
which separates clusters that have different means. We propose two k-groups
algorithms: k-groups by first variation; and k-groups by second variation. The
implementation of k-groups is partly based on Hartigan and Wong's algorithm for
k-means. The algorithm is generalized from moving one point on each iteration
(first variation) to moving $m$ $(m > 1)$ points. For univariate data, we prove
that Hartigan and Wong's k-means algorithm is a special case of k-groups by
first variation. The simulation results from univariate and multivariate cases
show that our k-groups algorithms perform as well as Hartigan and Wong's
k-means algorithm when clusters are well-separated and normally distributed.
Moreover, both k-groups algorithms perform better than k-means when data does
not have a finite first moment or data has strong skewness and heavy tails. For
non--spherical clusters, both k-groups algorithms performed better than k-means
in high dimension, and k-groups by first variation is consistent as dimension
increases. In a case study on dermatology data with 34 features, both k-groups
algorithms performed better than k-means.

associated algorithm for simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting
of $N$ ($N\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible fluids in domains involving
outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised based on the
properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability
property ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the
energy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to
increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very
effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The
reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent
from the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to
those corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our
numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the
N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled
individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant
linear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and
time-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the
algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive. We present
extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid
components and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In
particular, we compare in detail the simulation results of a three-phase
capillary wave problem with Prosperetti's exact physical solution and

stellar wavefronts in two parts: stellar tip-tilt and high-spatial-order
laser-correction. The requirement of a sufficiently bright guide star in the
field-of-view to correct tip-tilt limits sky coverage. Here we show an
improvement to effective seeing without the need for nearby bright stars,
enabling full sky coverage by performing only laser-assisted wavefront
correction. We used Robo-AO, the first robotic AO system, to comprehensively
demonstrate this laser-only correction. We analyze observations from four years
of efficient robotic operation covering 15,000 targets and 42,000 observations,
each realizing different seeing conditions. Using an autoguider (or a
post-processing software equivalent) and the laser to improve effective seeing
independent of the brightness of a target, Robo-AO observations show a 39+/-19%
improvement to effective FWHM, without any tip-tilt correction. We also
demonstrate that 50% encircled-energy performance without tip-tilt correction
remains comparable to diffraction-limited, standard Robo-AO performance.
Faint-target science programs primarily limited by 50% encircled-energy (e.g.
those employing integral field spectrographs placed behind the AO system) may
see significant benefits to sky coverage from employing laser-only AO.

to accommodate multimodality and skewness features, and the second level models
tail behavior. Moreover, the latter is specified in a way that no degrees of

results: Fibre impedance models indicate activity in unmyelinated fibres can be

of this channel over a finite UAV communication period, subject to its maximum
speed constraint and an average transmit power constraint. To achieve the
capacity, the UAV should use a sufficiently long code that spans over its whole
communication period. Accordingly, the multicast channel capacity is achieved
via maximizing the minimum achievable time-averaged rates of the $K$ users, by
jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power allocation over
time. However, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally.
To tackle this problem, we first consider a relaxed problem by ignoring the
maximum UAV speed constraint, and obtain its globally optimal solution via the
Lagrange dual method. The optimal solution reveals that the UAV should hover
above a finite number of ground locations, with the optimal hovering duration
and transmit power at each location. Next, based on such a
multi-location-hovering solution, we present a successive hover-and-fly
trajectory design and obtain the corresponding optimal transmit power
allocation for the case with the maximum UAV speed constraint. Numerical
results show that our proposed joint UAV trajectory and transmit power
optimization significantly improves the achievable rate of the UAV-enabled

ingredients for describing the complicated observational phenomenology of
neutron stars in binary systems. Motivated by high quality burst rate data
emerging from large statistical studies, we report general calculations
relating bursting rate to mass accretion rate and neutron star rotation
frequency. In this first work we neglect general relativistic effects and
accretion topology, though we discuss where their inclusion should play a role.
The relations we derive are suitable for different burning regimes and provide
a direct link between parameters predicted by theory and what is to be expected
in observations. We illustrate this for analytical relations of different
unstable burning regimes that operate on the surface of an accreting neutron
star. We also use the observed behaviour of burst rate to suggest new
constraints on burning parameters. We are able to provide an explanation for
the long standing problem of the observed decrease of burst rate with
increasing mass accretion that follows naturally from these calculations: when
accretion rate crosses a certain threshold, ignition moves away from its
initially preferential site and this can cause a net reduction of the burst
rate due to the effects of local conditions that set local differences in both
burst rate and stabilization criteria. We show under which conditions this can
happen even if locally the burst rate keeps increasing with accretion.

do not know whether or not the latter exists, or its strengths, and thus the
inference about the characteristic effects should be valid uniformly over a
broad class of data generating processes for idiosyncratic parameters. We
construct our estimation and inference in a two-step continuous-time GMM

idiosyncratic parameter is near the boundary (zero), which makes the usual
""plug-in"" method using the estimated asymptotic variance only valid pointwise

emission. By comparing H-alpha and [OI] intensities, we find that regions with
log NHI = 19.5 - 20.0 are 16 - 67% ionized. Most of the H-alpha intensities
along the Magellanic Stream are much higher than expected if the primary
ionization source is photoionization from Magellanic Clouds, the Milky Way, and
the extragalactic background. We find that the additional contribution from
self ionization through a ""shock cascade"" that results as the Stream plows
through the halo might be sufficient to reproduce the underlying level of
H-alpha emission along the Stream. In the sparsely sampled region below the
South Galactic Pole, there exists a subset of sight lines with
uncharacteristically bright emission, which suggest that gas is being ionized
further by an additional source that could be a linked to energetic processes
associated with the Galactic center.

fashion, so that the state at time 0 follows the state at time N-1 in the same
way as states at times t follow those at times t-1 for 0<t<N. This wrap-around
of the chain is achieved using a coupling procedure, and produces states that
all have close to the equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain, under the
assumption that coupled chains are likely to coalesce in less than N/2
iterations. This procedure therefore automatically eliminates the initial
portion of the chain that would otherwise need to be discarded to get good
estimates of equilibrium averages. The assumption of rapid coalescence can be
tested using auxiliary chains started at times spaced between 0 and N. When
multiple processors are available, such auxiliary chains can be simulated in
parallel, and pieced together to give the circularly-coupled chain, in less
time than a sequential simulation would have taken, provided that coalescence
is indeed rapid.
  The practical utility of these procedures is dependent on the development of
good coupling schemes. I show how a specialized random-grid Metropolis
algorithm can be used to produce the required exact coalescence. On its own,
this method is not efficient in high dimensions, but it can be used to produce
exact coalescence once other methods have brought the coupled chains close
together. I investigate how well this combined scheme works with standard
Metropolis, Langevin, and Gibbs sampling updates. Using such strategies, I show
that circular coupling can work effectively in a Bayesian logistic regression

hierarchy of models by starting with the simplest assumptions (transfer of
perfectly spin-polarized excitons from Mn-free dot to the other dot containing
a single Mn$^{2+}$ spin, followed by radiative recombination) and subsequently
adding more features, such as spin relaxation of electrons and holes.
Particular attention is paid to the role of the influx of the dark excitons and
the process of biexciton formation, which are shown to contribute significantly
to the orientation process in the quasi-resonant excitation case. Analyzed
scenarios show how multiple features of the excitonic complexes in
magnetically-doped quantum dots, such as the values of exchange integrals, spin
relaxation times, etc., lead to a plethora of optical orientation processes,
characterized by distinct dependencies on light polarization and laser
intensity, and occurring on distinct timescales. Comparison with experimental
data shows that the correct description of the optical orientation mechanism
requires taking into account Mn$^{2+}$ spin-flip processes occurring not only
when the exciton is already in the orbital ground state of the light-emitting
dot, but also those that happen during the exciton transfer from high-energy
states to the ground state. Inspired by the experimental results on energy
relaxation of electrons and holes in nonmagnetic dots, we focus on the process
of biexciton creation allowed by mutual spin-flip of an electron and the

systematically with the source flux. We detect type-C QPOs in the power spectra

theory --- Strassen's exponent of matrix multiplication $\omega$ and

tensor, i.e., the $3$-tensor or bilinear operator $\mu_{l,m,n} : \mathbb{F}^{l

$\mu_{l,m,n}$. We will show that Grothendieck's constant is the least upper
bound on a tensor norm of $\mu_{l,m,n}$, taken over all $l, m, n \in

The optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and linewidth, spin
coherence time, and spin relaxation time, are measured as a function of
implantation energy, dose, annealing temperature and surface treatment. To
track the presence of damage and surface-related spin defects, we perform in
situ electron spin resonance spectroscopy through both double electron-electron
resonance and cross-relaxation spectroscopy on the NV centres. We find that,
for the energy ($4-30$~keV) and dose ($5\times10^{11}-10^{13}$~ions/cm$^2$)
ranges considered, the NV spin properties are mainly governed by the dose via
residual implantation-induced paramagnetic defects, but that the resulting
magnetic sensitivity is essentially independent of both dose and energy. We
then show that the magnetic sensitivity is significantly improved by
high-temperature annealing at $\geq1100^\circ$C. Moreover, the spin properties
are not significantly affected by oxygen annealing, apart from the spin
relaxation time, which is dramatically decreased. Finally, the average NV depth
is determined by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, giving
$\approx10$-17~nm at 4-6 keV implantation energy. This study sheds light on the
optimal conditions to create dense layers of near-surface NV centres for
high-sensitivity sensing and imaging applications.

serialized. Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent
serializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the
choice from one of them. This phenomenon is documented as the ""order-matters""
problem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to
reward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations.
However, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is

taking into consideration only the previous predictions that it depends on. In

examples, in which both the relative plausibility of various explanations, as
well as which explanations are valid, are learned directly from data. The main
shortcoming of this formulation of the task is that it assumes access to
full-information (i.e., fully specified) examples; relatedly, it offers no role
for declarative background knowledge, as such knowledge is rendered redundant
in the abduction task by complete information. In this work, we extend the
formulation to utilize such partially specified examples, along with
declarative background knowledge about the missing data. We show that it is
possible to use implicitly learned rules together with the explicitly given
declarative knowledge to support hypotheses in the course of abduction. We
observe that when a small explanation exists, it is possible to obtain a
much-improved guarantee in the challenging exception-tolerant setting. Such
small, human-understandable explanations are of particular interest for
potential applications of the task.

well-known $3/2_3^-$ cluster state, the $1/2_2^-$ and $5/2_3^-$ states are also
proposed as the well-developed cluster states. For the positive-parity states,
it is found that many states around the 2$\alpha+t$ threshold show the feature
of developed clusters. In particular, the $1/2_2^+$ state is found to have a
linear-chain-like structure, which is consistent with the previous
antisymmetrized molecular dynamics calculation, but contradicts to the

to the relaxation of the divergence constraint in classical mixed methods, and

large and complicated pressures. In this contribution, an analogue of grad-div
stabilization for Discontinuous Galerkin methods is studied. Here, the key is
the penalization of the jumps of the normal velocities over facets of the
triangulation, which controls the measure-valued part of the distributional
divergence of the discrete velocity solution. Our contribution is twofold:
first, we characterize the limit for arbitrarily large penalization parameters,
which shows that the stabilized nonconforming Discontinuous Galerkin methods
remain robust and accurate in this limit; second, we extend these ideas to the
case of non-simplicial meshes; here, broken grad-div stabilization must be used
in addition to the normal velocity jump penalization, in order to get the
desired pressure robustness effect. The analysis is performed for the Stokes
equations, and more complex flows and Crouzeix-Raviart elements are considered
in numerical examples that also show the relevance of the theory in practical

To analyze this we annotate these vehicles by their semantic parts to create a

enjoyed success in many domains, due to its 'temporal elasticity', a property
particularly useful when matching temporal data. Unfortunately this
dissimilarity measure suffers from a quadratic computational cost, which

sparsification of the alignment path search space for DTW-like measures,
essentially to lower their computational cost without loosing on the quality of

arches or vaults that clog the exit. These clogs may be destroyed by
vibrations. A feature which remains elusive is the broad distribution $p(\tau)$
of clog lifetimes $\tau$ measured under constant vibrations. Here, we propose a
simple model for arch-breaking, in which the vibrations are formally equivalent
to thermal fluctuations in a Langevin equation; the rupture of an arch
corresponds to the escape from an energy trap. We infer the distribution of
trap depths from experiments and, using this distribution, we show that the
model captures the empirically observed heavy tails in $p(\tau)$. These heavy
tails flatten at large $\tau$, consistently with experimental observations
under weak vibrations, but this flattening is found to be systematic, thus
questioning the ability of gentle vibrations to restore a finite outflow
forever. The trap model also replicates recent results on the effect of
increasing gravity on the statistics of clog formation in a static silo.
Therefore, the proposed framework points to a common physical underpinning to
the processes of clogging and unclogging, despite their different statistics.

been proved to outperform conventional statistical machine translation (SMT)
across a variety of language pairs. Translation is an open-vocabulary problem,
but most existing NMT systems operate with a fixed vocabulary, which causes the
incapability of translating rare words. This problem can be alleviated by using
different translation granularities, such as character, subword and hybrid
word-character. Translation involving Chinese is one of the most difficult
tasks in machine translation, however, to the best of our knowledge, there has
not been any other work exploring which translation granularity is most
suitable for Chinese in NMT. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparison
using Chinese-English NMT as a case study. Furthermore, we discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of various translation granularities in detail.
Our experiments show that subword model performs best for Chinese-to-English
translation with the vocabulary which is not so big while hybrid word-character
model is most suitable for English-to-Chinese translation. Moreover,
experiments of different granularities show that Hybrid_BPE method can achieve
best result on Chinese-to-English translation task.

experienced a renewed interest in recent years due to the possibility of
performing these measurements with rare isotopes, using inverse kinematics.
Several theoretical models are being used for the interpretation of these new
data, such as the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA), the transition
amplitude formulation of the Faddeev equations due to Alt, Grassberger and
Sandhas (FAGS) and, more recently, a coupled-channels method here referred to
as transfer-to-the-continuum (TC).
  [Purpose] Our goal is to compare the momentum distributions calculated with
the DWIA and TC models for the same reactions, using whenever possible the same
inputs (e.g. distorting potential). A comparison with already published results
for the FAGS formalism is performed as well.
  [Method] We choose the $^{15}$C($p$,$pn$)$^{14}$C reaction at an incident
energy of 420 MeV/u, which has been previously studied with the FAGS formalism.
The knocked-out neutron is assumed to be in a $2s$ single-particle orbital.
Longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions are calculated for different
assumed separation energies.
  [Results] For all cases considered, we find a very good agreement between
DWIA and TC results. The energy dependence of the distorting optical potentials
is found to affect in a modest way the shape and magnitude of the momentum
distributions. Moreover, when relativistic kinematics corrections are omitted,
our calculations reproduce remarkably well the FAGS result.
  [Conclusions] The results found in this work provide confidence on the
consistency and accuracy of the DWIA and TC models for analyzing momentum
distributions for $(p,pn)$ reactions at intermediate energies.

self-gravitating polytropes for axially symmetric ellipsoids and rings. The
confinement of the fluid by photons is accounted for through a boundary
condition on the enthalpy $H$. Equilibrium configurations are determined
numerically from a generalised ""Self-Consistent-Field""-method. The new
algorithm incorporates an intra-loop re-scaling operator ${\cal R}(H)$, which
is essential for both convergence and getting self-normalised solutions. The
main control parameter is the external-to-core enthalpy ratio. In the case of
uniform rotation rate and uniform surrounding pressure, we compute the mass,
the volume, the rotation rate and the maximum enthalpy. This is repeated for a
few polytropic indices $n$. For a given axis ratio, over-pressurization
globally increases all output quantities, and this is more pronounced for large
$n$. Density profiles are flatter than in the absence of an external pressure.
When the control parameter asymptotically tends to unity, the fluid converges
toward the incompressible solution, whatever the index, but becomes
geometrically singular. Equilibrium sequences, obtained by varying the axis
ratio, are built. States of critical rotation are greatly exceeded or even
disappear. The same trends are observed with differential rotation. Finally,
the typical response to a photon point source is presented. Strong irradiation
favours sharp edges. Applications concern star forming regions and matter
orbiting young stars and black holes.

used with great success to prove conditional lower bounds for numerous
important data structure problems, see Henzinger et al. [STOC'15]. In recent
work, Larsen and Williams [SODA'17] attacked the problem from the upper bound
side and gave a surprising cell probe data structure (that is, we only charge
for memory accesses, while computation is free). Their cell probe data
structure answers queries in $\tilde{O}(n^{7/4})$ time and is succinct in the
sense that it stores the input matrix in read-only memory, plus an additional
$\tilde{O}(n^{7/4})$ bits on the side. In this paper, we essentially settle the
cell probe complexity of succinct Boolean matrix-vector multiplication. We
present a new cell probe data structure with query time $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$
storing just $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ bits on the side. We then complement our data
structure with a lower bound showing that any data structure storing $r$ bits
on the side, with $n < r < n^2$ must have query time $t$ satisfying $t r =
\tilde{\Omega}(n^3)$. For $r \leq n$, any data structure must have $t =
\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$. Since lower bounds in the cell probe model also apply to
classic word-RAM data structures, the lower bounds naturally carry over. We
also prove similar lower bounds for matrix-vector multiplication over

analysis. This methodological study is meant as preparation for full QCD. The
topological charge density is becoming visible in the process of overimproved
gradient flow, which is monitored by means of the the Inverse Participation
Ratio (IPR). The flow is stopped at the moment when calorons dissociate into
dyons due to the overimproved character of the underlying action. This gives
the possibility to simultaneously detect all three dyonic constituents of KvBLL
calorons in the gluonic field. The behaviour of the average Polyakov loop under
(overimproved) gradient flow could be also (as its value) a diagnostics for the
actual phase the configuration is belonging to. Timelike Abelian monopole
currents and specific patterns of the local Polyakov loop are correlated with
the topological clusters.The spectrum of reconstructed cluster charges $Q_{cl}$
corresponds to the phases. It is scattered around $Q_{cl} \approx \pm 1/3$ in
the confined phase, whereas it is $Q_{cl} \approx \pm 0.5 \div 0.7$ for heavy
dyons and $|Q_{cl}| < 0.3$ for light dyons in the deconfined phase. Heavy dyons
are increasingly suppressed with increasing temperature. The paper is dedicated
to the memory of Michael Mueller-Preussker who was a member of our research
group for more than twenty years.

experimentally, using temperature programmed desorption and surface-specific
vibrational spectroscopy, and theoretically, using periodic-slab density

site (the so-called 1-4 configuration) and that at this site the barrier
between the molecularly and dissociatively adsorbed forms is very low: 0.06 eV.
A subset of OD stretch vibrations are parallel to this dissociation coordinate,

uncoupled harmonic oscillator. To quantify this effect we solve the vibrational
Schr\""odinger equation along the dissociation coordinate and find fundamental
frequencies red-shifted by more than 1,500 cm$^{\text{-1}}$. Within the context

matching such that no edge of $E$ connects endpoints of two different edges of
$H$. We show that in a convex bipartite graph with $n$ vertices and $m$
weighted edges, an induced matching of maximum total weight can be computed in
$O(n+m)$ time. An unweighted convex bipartite graph has a representation of
size $O(n)$ that records for each vertex $u\in U$ the first and last neighbor
in the ordering of $V$. Given such a compact representation, we compute an
induced matching of maximum cardinality in $O(n)$ time.
  In convex bipartite graphs, maximum-cardinality induced matchings are dual to
minimum chain covers. A chain cover is a covering of the edge set by chain
subgraphs, that is, subgraphs that do not contain induced matchings of more
than one edge. Given a compact representation, we compute a representation of a
minimum chain cover in $O(n)$ time. If no compact representation is given, the
cover can be computed in $O(n+m)$ time.
  All of our algorithms achieve optimal running time for the respective problem
and model. Previous algorithms considered only the unweighted case, and the
best algorithm for computing a maximum-cardinality induced matching or a
minimum chain cover in a convex bipartite graph had a running time of $O(n^2)$.

predict the audience demographic attributes. The key to achieving good

of publications started developing the framework of Cyber Peacekeeping (CPK)

organizations such as ITU IMPACT, NATO CCDCOE and Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, and found that they did not satisfy requirements to effectively
host CPK activities. An assessment of organizations currently working in the
areas related to CPK found that the United Nations (UN) has mandates and
organizational structures that appear to somewhat overlap the needs of CPK.
However, the UN's current approach to Peacekeeping cannot be directly mapped to
cyberspace. In this research we analyze the development of traditional
Peacekeeping in the United Nations, and current initiatives in cyberspace.
Specifically, we will compare the proposed CPK framework with the recent
initiative of the United Nations named the 'Digital Blue Helmets' as well as
with other projects in the UN which helps to predict and mitigate conflicts.
Our goal is to find practical recommendations for the implementation of the CPK

the CPK framework overlap with those of the 'Digital Blue Helmets' and the
Global Pulse program.

tractable. So far, the largest structural class that is known to be
polynomial-time solvable is the class of bounded hypertree width instances

solvable instances: those having bounded fractional edge cover number.
  Combining hypertree width and fractional edge cover number, we then introduce
the notion of fractional hypertree width. We prove that constraint satisfaction
problems with bounded fractional hypertree width can be solved in polynomial

with a recent approximation algorithm for finding such decompositions by Marx,
it follows that bounded fractional hypertree width is now the most general

unsolved problem, with many inhibitive factors imposed by the
technically-challenging nature of polarization observations. Such an algorithm
is essential for Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinder surveys, such as the
Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR),
as data volumes are significant enough to prohibit manual inspection. We
present a new strategy of `Faraday Moments' for source-finding in linear
polarization with LOFAR, using the moments of the frequency-dependent
full-Stokes data (i.e. the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess
kurtosis). Through simulations of the sky, we find that moments can identify
polarized sources with a high completeness: 98.5% at a signal-to-noise of 5.
While the method has low reliability, Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis can be
applied per candidate source to filter out instrumental and spurious
detections. This combined strategy will result in a complete and reliable
catalogue of polarized sources that includes the full sensitivity of the
observational bandwidth. We find that the technique can reduce the number of
pixels on which RM Synthesis needs to be performed by a factor of
$\approx1\times10^{5}$ for source distributions anticipated with modern radio
telescopes. Through tests on LOFAR data, we find that the technique works
effectively in the presence of diffuse emission. Extensions of this method are
directly applicable to other upcoming radio surveys such as the POlarization
Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) with the Australia Square
Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and the SKA itself.

traces in the matter orbiting the attractor. Counterrotating and even
misaligned structures orbiting around the SMBHs would be consequences of these
episodes. Our task in this work is to consider situations where such accretions
occur and to trace their remnants represented by several toroidal accreting
fluids, corotating or counterrotating relative to the central Kerr attractor,
and created in various regimes during the evolution of matter configurations
around SMBHs. We focus particularly on the emergence of matter instabilities,
i.e., tori collisions, accretion onto the central Kerr black hole, or creation
of jet-like structures (proto-jets). Each orbiting configuration is governed by
the general relativistic hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium
configurations of rotating perfect fluid. We prove that sequences of
configurations and hot points, where an instability occurs, characterize the
Kerr SMBHs, depending mainly on their spin-mass ratios. The occurrence of tori
accretion or collision are strongly constrained by the fluid rotation with
respect to the central black hole and the relative rotation with respect to
each other. Our investigation provides characteristic of attractors where
traces of multi-accreting episodes can be found and observed.

sufficient energy to leave a detectable imprint in experiments designed to

carrying a typical momentum of $\sim30$~MeV$/c$, both types of experiments
provide competitive constraints. This study also demonstrates that non-standard

evolves oppositely for $\alpha>0$ and $\alpha<0$, while decreasing with the
increasing $\mid\alpha\mid$. When there is sufficient dark matter around the
black hole, the black hole spacetime changes remarkably; (iii) The singularity
of these black holes is the same as that of rotational black holes. In
addition, we study the geodesic motion using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism and
find that when $\alpha$ is in the above ranges for $\Lambda=0$, stable orbits
exist. Furthermore, the rotational velocity of the black hole in the equatorial
plane has different behaviour for different $\alpha$ and the black hole spin
$a$. It is asymptotically flat and independent of $\alpha$ if $\alpha>0$ while
is asymptotically flat only when $\alpha$ is close to zero if $\alpha<0$.

solutions surrounded by the perfect fluid matter in the Rastall gravity using
the Newman-Janis method and Mathematica package. We then discuss the black hole
properties surrounded by two kinds of specific perfect fluid matter, the dark
energy ($\omega=-2/3$) and the perfect fluid dark matter ($\omega=-1/3$).
Firstly, the Rastall parameter $\kappa\lambda$ could be constrained by the weak
energy condition and strong energy condition. Secondly, by analyzing the number
of roots in the horizon equation, we get the range of the perfect fluid matter
intensity $\alpha$, which depends on the black hole mass $M$ and the Rastall
parameter $\kappa\lambda$. Thirdly, we study the influence of the perfect fluid
dark matter and dark energy on the ergosphere. We find that the perfect fluid
dark matter has significant effects on the ergosphere size, while the dark
energy has smaller effects. Finally, we find that the perfect fluid matter does
not change the singularity of the black hole. Furthermore, we investigate the
rotation velocity in the equatorial plane for the KN-AdS black hole with dark
energy and perfect fluid dark matter. We propose that the rotation curve
diversity in Low Surface Brightness galaxies could be explained in the

of enclosed volume. The flux appears as an integral involving the pairwise
mutual induction formula for vortex loop pairs first derived by Helmholtz and

pairwise fashion and generates a nonclassical state. Finally, a matched second
period of spin exchange is performed that nonlinearly amplifies the output
signal and maps the phase onto readily detectable first moments. Depending on

stellar object (YSO) candidates in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galactic
center. Our goal is to quantify the contamination of this YSO sample by
reddened giant stars with circumstellar envelopes and to determine the star
formation rate in the CMZ. We obtained KMOS low-resolution near-infrared
spectra (R ~4000) between 2.0 and 2.5 um of sources, many of them previously
identified, by mid-infrared photometric criteria, as massive YSOs in the
Galactic center. Our final sample consists of 91 stars with good
signal-to-noise ratio. We separate YSOs from cool late-type stars based on
spectral features of CO and Br_gamma at 2.3 um and 2.16 um respectively. We
make use of SED model fits to the observed photometric data points from 1.25 to
24 um in order to estimate approximate masses for the YSOs. Using the
spectroscopically identified YSOs in our sample, we confirm that existing
colour-colour diagrams and colour-magnitude diagrams are unable to efficiently
separate YSOs and cool late-type stars. In addition, we define a new
colour-colour criterion that separates YSOs from cool late-type stars in the
H-Ks vs H-[8.0] diagram. We use this new criterion to identify YSO candidates
in the |l| < 1.5, |b|<0.5 degree region and use model SED fits to estimate
their approximate masses. By assuming an appropriate initial mass function
(IMF) and extrapolating the stellar IMF down to lower masses, we determine a
star formation rate (SFR) of ~0.046 +/- 0.026 Msun/yr assuming an average age
of 0.75 +/- 0.25 Myr for the YSOs. This value is lower than estimates found
using the YSO counting method in the literature. Our SFR estimate in the CMZ
agrees with the previous estimates from different methods and reaffirms that
star formation in the CMZ is proceeding at a lower rate than predicted by
various star forming models.

languages. A business-logic component may be written in Java or OCaml, a
resource-intensive component in C or Rust, and a high-assurance component in
Coq. In this multi-language world, program execution sends values from one
linguistic context to another. This boundary-crossing exposes values to
contexts with unforeseen behavior---that is, behavior that could not arise in
the source language of the value. For example, a Rust function may end up being
applied in an ML context that violates the memory usage policy enforced by
Rust's type system. This leads to the question of how developers ought to
reason about code in such a multi-language world where behavior inexpressible
in one language is easily realized in another.
  This paper proposes the novel idea of linking types to address the problem of
reasoning about single-language components in a multi-lingual setting.
Specifically, linking types allow programmers to annotate where in a program
they can link with components inexpressible in their unadulterated language.
This enables developers to reason about (behavioral) equality using only their

magnification of images lensed by a Schwarzschild lens is always larger than
unity. We investigate an extended source effect on the light curves microlensed
by the Ellis wormhole. We show that the depth of the gutter of the light curves

however, distinguish between the light curves of the extended source
microlensed by the Ellis wormhole and the ones by the Schwarzschild lens in
their shapes even if the size of the source is a few times larger than the size
of an Einstein ring on a source plane. If the relative velocity of a star with
the radius of $10^6$ km at $8$ kpc in the bulge of our galaxy against an

Navier-Stokes solver, PARIS Simulator, using a volume-of-fluid method. The gas
flow remains unsolved and is instead assumed to have a fixed pressure which is
applied to the liquid through a Dirichlet boundary condition on the arbitrary
liquid-gas interface. Gas bubbles are tracked individually, allowing the gas
pressure to be prescribed using a suitable equation of state.
  Simulations with hundreds of bubbles have been performed in a fixed domain
under a constant rate of expansion. A bubble competition is observed: larger
bubbles tend to expand more rapidly at the demise of smaller ones. The time
scale of competition is shown to depend on a modified Weber number.

Inductive Logic Programming offer an extremely data-efficient process by which

unable to deal with the variety of domains neural networks can be applied to:
they are not robust to noise in or mislabelling of inputs, and perhaps more
importantly, cannot be applied to non-symbolic domains where the data is
ambiguous, such as operating on raw pixels. In this paper, we propose a
Differentiable Inductive Logic framework, which can not only solve tasks which
traditional ILP systems are suited for, but shows a robustness to noise and
error in the training data which ILP cannot cope with. Furthermore, as it is
trained by backpropagation against a likelihood objective, it can be hybridised

These include stars disrupted by the central supermassive black hole, and
supernovae that are 10-100 times more energetic than typical ones. However, the
nature of even more energetic transients that apparently occur in the innermost
regions of their host galaxies is hotly debated. Here we report the discovery
of the most energetic of these to date: PS1-10adi, with a total radiated energy
of ~ 2.3 x 10^52 erg. The slow evolution of its light curve and persistently
narrow spectral lines over ~3 yr are inconsistent with known types of recurring
black hole variability. The observed properties imply powering by shock
interaction between expanding material and large quantities of surrounding
dense matter. Plausible sources of this expanding material are a star that has
been tidally disrupted by the central black hole, or a supernova. Both could
satisfy the energy budget. For the former, we would be forced to invoke a new
and hitherto unseen variant of a tidally disrupted star, while a supernova
origin relies principally on environmental effects resulting from its nuclear
location. Remarkably, we also discovered that PS1-10adi is not an isolated
case. We therefore surmise that this new population of transients has
previously been overlooked due to incorrect association with underlying central
black hole activity.

this for cyclic branched covers of fibred knots in integer homology $3$-spheres

the proof of the L-space conjecture for closed, connected, orientable,

that the universal abelian cover of a manifold obtained by generic Dehn surgery
on a hyperbolic fibred knot in an integer homology $3$-sphere admits a
co-oriented taut foliation and has left-orderable fundamental group, even if
the surgered manifold does not, and that the same holds for many branched
covers of satellite knots with braided patterns. A key fact used in our proofs
is that the Euler class of a universal circle representation associated to a
co-oriented taut foliation coincides with the Euler class of the foliation's

astrophysics. Large-scale flows in thin layers can be considered
two-dimensional (2d) with bottom friction added. Here we find that the
properties of such flows depend dramatically on the way they are driven. We
argue that wall-driven (Couette) flow cannot sustain turbulence at however
small viscosity and friction. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) up to the
Reynolds number $Re=10^6$ confirm that all perturbations die in a plane Couette
flow. On the contrary, for sufficiently small viscosity and friction, we show
that finite perturbations destroy the pressure-driven laminar (Poiseuille)
flow. What appears instead is a traveling wave in the form of a jet slithering
between wall vortices. For $10^4<Re<5\cdot10^4$, the mean flow has remarkably
simple structure: the jet is sinusoidal with a parabolic velocity profile,
vorticity is constant inside vortices, while the fluctuations are small. At
higher $Re$ strong fluctuations appear, yet the mean traveling wave survives.
Considering the momentum flux barrier in such a flow, we derive a new scaling
law for the $Re$-dependence of the friction factor and confirm it by DNS.

the new CHROMIS Fabry-Perot instrument at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST)
to identify the intermittency of magnetic reconnection and its association with
the formation of plasmoids in so-called UV bursts in the low solar atmosphere.
The Si IV 1403A UV burst spectra from the transition region show evidence of
highly broadened line profiles with often non-Gaussian and triangular shapes,
in addition to signatures of bidirectional flows. Such profiles had previously
been linked, in idealized numerical simulations, to magnetic reconnection
driven by the plasmoid instability. Simultaneous CHROMIS images in the
chromospheric Ca II K 3934A line now provide compelling evidence for the
presence of plasmoids, by revealing highly dynamic and rapidly moving
brightenings that are smaller than 0.2 arcsec and that evolve on timescales of
order seconds. Our interpretation of the observations is supported by detailed
comparisons with synthetic observables from advanced numerical simulations of
magnetic reconnection and associated plasmoids in the chromosphere. Our results
highlight how subarcsecond imaging spectroscopy sensitive to a wide range of

enough to compare with observations can directly reveal the small-scale

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is widely used for simulating the
outcome of such violent collisions, one prominent example being the formation
of the Moon. However, a decade of numerical studies in various areas of
computational astrophysics has shown that the standard formulation of SPH
suffers from several shortcomings such as artificial surface tension and its
tendency to promptly damp turbulent motions on scales much larger than the
physical dissipation scale, both resulting in the suppression of mixing. In
order to quantify how severe these limitations are when modeling GIs we carried
out a comparison of simulations with identical initial conditions performed
with the standard SPH as well as with the novel Lagrangian Meshless Finite Mass
(MFM) method in the GIZMO code. We confirm the lack of mixing between the
impactor and target when SPH is employed, while MFM is capable of driving
vigorous sub-sonic turbulence and leads to significant mixing between the two
bodies. Modern SPH variants with artificial conductivity, a different
formulation of the hydro force or reduced artificial viscosity, do not improve
mixing as significantly. Angular momentum is conserved similarly well in both
methods, but MFM does not suffer from spurious transport induced by artificial
viscosity, resulting in a slightly higher angular momentum of the proto-lunar
disk. Furthermore, SPH initial conditions exhibit an unphysical density
discontinuity at the core-mantle boundary which is easily removed in MFM.

attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can
be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely

$\phi=0.5\%-10\%$. The solid-to-fluid density ratio $R=1.5$ and the Galileo
number (i.e. the ratio between buoyancy and viscous forces) based on the
diameter of a sphere with equivalent volume $Ga=60$. With this choice of
parameters, an isolated oblate falls vertically with a steady wake with its
broad side perpendicular to the gravity direction. At this $Ga$, the mean
settling speed of spheres is a decreasing function of the volume $\phi$ and is
always smaller than the terminal velocity of the isolated particle, $V_t$. On
the contrary, we show here that the mean settling speed of oblate particles
increases with $\phi$ in dilute conditions and is $33\%$ larger than $V_t$. At
higher concentrations, the mean settling speed decreases becoming smaller than
the terminal velocity $V_t$ between $\phi=5\%$ and $10\%$. The increase of the
mean settling speed is due to the formation of particle clusters that for
$\phi=0.5\%-1\%$ appear as columnar-like structures. From the pair-distribution
function we observe that it is most probable to find particle-pairs almost
vertically aligned. However, the pair-distribution function is non-negligible

luminosities are highly uncertain due to confounding variables and a lack of
knowledge about some aspects of the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
We propose a new methodology to calculate the jet powers of the largest, most
powerful radio sources based on combinations of their size, lobe luminosity and
shape of their radio spectrum; this approach avoids the uncertainties
encountered by previous relationships. The outputs of our model are calibrated
using hydrodynamical simulations and tested against independent X-ray
inverse-Compton measurements. The jet powers and lobe magnetic field strengths
of radio sources are found to be recovered using solely the lobe luminosity and
spectral curvature, enabling the intrinsic properties of unresolved
high-redshift sources to be inferred. By contrast, the radio source ages cannot
be estimated without knowledge of the lobe volumes. The monochromatic lobe
luminosity alone is incapable of accurately estimating the jet power or source
age without knowledge of the lobe magnetic field strength and size
respectively. We find that, on average, the lobes of the 3C radio sources have
magnetic field strengths approximately a factor three lower than the
equipartition value, inconsistent with equal energy in the particles and the
fields at the 5$\sigma$ level. The particle content of 3C radio lobes is
discussed in the context of complementary observations; we do not find evidence
favouring an energetically-dominant proton population.

structural parameters. Our starting point is a recent paper due to Fomin and
Str{\o}mme [WG 2016] who gave a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(|X|^{12})$ vertices
when $X$ is a vertex set such that each connected component of $G-X$ contains
at most one cycle, i.e., $X$ is a modulator to a pseudoforest. We strongly
generalize this result by using modulators to $d$-quasi-forests, i.e., graphs
where each connected component has a feedback vertex set of size at most $d$,
and obtain kernels with $\mathcal{O}(|X|^{3d+9})$ vertices. Our result relies
on proving that minimal blocking sets in a $d$-quasi-forest have size at most
$d+2$. This bound is tight and there is a related lower bound of
$\mathcal{O}(|X|^{d+2-\epsilon})$ on the bit size of kernels.
  In fact, we also get bounds for minimal blocking sets of more general graph
classes: For $d$-quasi-bipartite graphs, where each connected component can be
made bipartite by deleting at most $d$ vertices, we get the same tight bound of
$d+2$ vertices. For graphs whose connected components each have a vertex cover
of cost at most $d$ more than the best fractional vertex cover, which we call
$d$-quasi-integral, we show that minimal blocking sets have size at most
$2d+2$, which is also tight. Combined with existing randomized polynomial
kernelizations this leads to randomized polynomial kernelizations for
modulators to $d$-quasi-bipartite and $d$-quasi-integral graphs. There are
lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(|X|^{d+2-\epsilon})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(|X|^{2d+2-\epsilon})$ for the bit size of such kernels.

that for $\phi=0.05$ and $0.1$, particles preferentially accumulate on the
corner bisectors, close to the duct corners as also observed for laminar square
duct flows of same duct-to-particle size ratios. At the highest volume
fraction, particles preferentially accumulate in the core region. For channel
flows, in the absence of lateral confinement particles are found instead to be
uniformily distributed across the channel. We also observe that the intensity
of the cross-stream secondary flows increases (with respect to the unladen

concentration of particles along the corner bisector. For $\phi=0.2$ the
turbulence activity is strongly reduced and the intensity of the secondary
flows reduces below that of the unladen case. The friction Reynolds number
increases with $\phi$ in dilute conditions, as observed for channel flows.
However, for $\phi=0.2$ the mean friction Reynolds number decreases below the

probability and device performance. However, the underlying physics has not

system, we report an intrinsic tunneling conductance enhancement near the

highly-conductive regions (tens of nanometers-wide) near the terrace edges.
First-principles calculations suggest that the terrace edge geometry can
trigger an electronic reconstruction, which reduces the effective tunneling
barrier width locally. Furthermore, such tunneling conductance enhancement can
be discovered in other transition-metal-oxides and controlled by surface
termination engineering. The controllable electronic reconstruction could

better generalization. We confirm these findings experimentally. Further, we
include experiments which show that learning rate schedules can be replaced

transition in structure and evolution between low- and high-mass stars,
providing a key test of accretion processes in higher-mass stars. Few Herbig
Ae/Be stars have detected magnetic fields, calling into question whether the
magnetospheric accretion paradigm developed for low-mass stars can be scaled to
higher masses. We present He I 10830 \AA\ line profiles for 64 Herbig Ae/Be
stars with a magnetic field measurement in order to test magnetospheric
accretion in the physical regime where its efficacy remains uncertain. Of the 5
stars with a magnetic field detection, 1 shows redshifted absorption,
indicative of infall, and 2 show blueshifted absorption, tracing mass outflow.
The fraction of redshifted and blueshifted absorption profiles in the
non-magnetic Herbig Ae/Be stars is remarkably similar, suggesting that the
stellar magnetic field does not affect gas kinematics traced by He I 10830 \AA.
Line profile morphology does not correlate with the luminosity, rotation rate,
mass accretion rate, or disk inclination. Only the detection of a magnetic
field and a nearly face-on disk inclination show a correlation (albeit for few
sources). This provides further evidence for weaker dipoles and more complex
field topologies as stars develop a radiative envelope. The small number of
magnetic Herbig Ae/Be stars has already called into question whether
magnetospheric accretion can be scaled to higher masses; accretion signatures
are not substantially different in magnetic Herbig Ae/Be stars, casting further
doubt that they accrete in the same manner as classical T Tauri stars.

squashed on one side, becoming laminar and eventually fragmented because of the
interaction and backreaction of the magnetic field. This model could explain an
observation of erupted fragments that fall back as thin and elongated strands

goes through radiation dominated, matter dominated, and de Sitter eras. We
argue that the parameter space allowing for such a stable evolution may be

that our model satisfies all known constraints due to gravitational wave
observations so far and thus can be considered as a unique testing ground of
gravitational wave phenomenologies in bimetric theories of gravity.

p=q=1 for the solutions of Ling-Fong Li, and the number of possibilities for p

While in the regime of geometric optics, the light bending due to this

an EW can produce the diffraction pattern on the observer plane. The
diffraction of the light (with the wavelength of $\lambda_e$) by the
gravitational wave playing the role of {\it gravitational grating} (with the

through the interference pattern on the observer plane. The consequence of this
fringe crossing is the modulation in the light curve of a quasar with the
period of few hours in the microwave wavelength. The optical depth for the
observation of this phenomenon for a Quasar with the multiple images strongly
lensed by a galaxy where the light trajectory of some of the images crosses the
lensing galaxy is $\tau \simeq 0.2$. By shifting the time delay of the light
curves of the multiple images in a strong-lensed quasar and removing the

structure of the disrupting galaxy as well as the gravitational potential of
its host. Streams around the Milky Way are especially promising as phase space
positions of individual stars will be measured by ongoing or upcoming surveys.
Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to accurately assess distances to stars
farther than 10 kpc from the Sun, where we have the poorest knowledge of the
Galaxy's mass distribution. To address this we present observations of 32
candidate RR Lyrae stars in the Orphan tidal stream taken as part of the
Spitzer Merger History and Shape of the Galactic Halo (SMHASH) program. The
extremely tight correlation between the periods, luminosities, and
metallicities of RR Lyrae variable stars in the Spitzer IRAC $\mathrm{3.6 \mu
m}$ band allows the determination of precise distances to individual stars; the
median statistical distance uncertainty to each RR Lyrae star is $2.5\%$. By
fitting orbits in an example potential we obtain an upper limit on the mass of
the Milky Way interior to 60 kpc of $\mathrm{5.6_{-1.1}^{+1.2}\times 10^{11}\
M_\odot}$, bringing estimates based on the Orphan Stream in line with those
using other tracers. The SMHASH data also resolve the stream in line--of--sight
depth, allowing a new perspective on the internal structure of the disrupted
dwarf galaxy. Comparing with N--body models we find that the progenitor had an
initial dark halo mass of approximately $\mathrm{3.2 \times 10^{9}\ M_\odot}$,
placing the Orphan Stream's progenitor amongst the classical dwarf spheroidals.

data [1], [2], many time series have a multiscale structure, which a
single-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical reservoir computing framework we call Deep Echo
State Networks (Deep-ESNs). The most distinctive feature of a Deep-ESN is its
ability to deal with time series through hierarchical projections.
Specifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional
echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., a PCA,
autoencoder, or a random projection) can project the echo-state representations
into a lower-dimensional space. These low-dimensional representations can then
be processed by another ESN. By using projection layers and encoding layers
alternately in the hierarchical framework, a Deep-ESN can not only attenuate
the effects of the collinearity problem in ESNs, but also fully take advantage
of the temporal kernel property of ESNs to explore multiscale dynamics of time
series. To fuse the multiscale representations obtained by each reservoir, we
add connections from each encoding layer to the last output layer. Theoretical
analyses prove that stability of a Deep-ESN is guaranteed by the echo state
property (ESP), and the time complexity is equivalent to a conventional ESN.
Experimental results on some artificial and real world time series demonstrate
that Deep-ESNs can capture multiscale dynamics, and outperform both standard
ESNs and previous hierarchical ESN-based models.

be fashioned into a radiation dispersal device typically emit gamma rays, while
fissile materials such as uranium and plutonium emit both neutrons and gamma
rays via spontaneous or induced fission. Therefore, the detection and
identification of hazardous materials has become increasingly important. We
present the results of GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of an active neutron
interrogation system based on highly segmented neutron/gamma-ray detector and
pulsed neutron generator. This system is capable of detecting and imaging
radioactive and special nuclear materials, explosives and drugs. The segmented
scintillation detector works as a scatter camera, allowing selection of a gamma

source localization. The detector consist of blocks made of plastic
scintillator which provide scattering and blocks of CsI, used as an absorber,
used as an absorber, which has to be efficient to detect the characteristic

background events can be significantly rejected, decreasing the number of
events required for high confidence detection and thereby greatly improving its
sensitivity. A scatter imager for the detection of shielded radioactive
materials has been conceptualized, simulated, and refined to maximize
sensitivity while minimizing cost.

increasingly prevalent in engineering analyses involving fractured rock masses.
For example, kinematic evaluations of slope or underground excavation stability
and the modeling of fluid flow in fractured rock have been shown to benefit
significantly from the explicit representation of DFN realizations in the
simulations. In practice, due to high computing costs, namely time, a balance
must be struck that limits analyses to the consideration of only a few
realizations as input. As a stochastic representation, a single realization is
only one possibility. It is therefore critical that the selected realizations
(possibilities) are able to summarize the range of variations present in the
input parameters adequately for the purpose of study or practice. That is, the
significance of diversity (dissimilarity) in the generated fracture networks is
of great importance and should be assessed prior to further often
time-consuming processing stages. We demonstrate here a novel development in
the analysis of the similarity between three-dimensional fracture networks,
which provides an accurate, efficient and practical solution with comprehensive
coverage of model variations. Several examples are presented together with a
comparison between the proposed three-dimensional method and existing methods
limited to two-dimensional assumptions. It is shown that the two-dimensional
similarity methods despite their popularity are heavily biased and poorly
represent the reality.

dissimilarity measure or distance between two Hidden Markov Models with state
conditional distributions being Gaussian. For such HMMs, the marginal
distribution at any time position follows a Gaussian mixture distribution, a
fact exploited to softly match, aka register, the states in two HMMs. We refer
to such HMMs as Gaussian mixture model-HMM (GMM-HMM). The registration of
states is inspired by the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the
Wasserstein metric between distributions. Specifically, the components of the
marginal GMMs are matched by solving an optimal transport problem where the
cost between components is the Wasserstein metric for Gaussian distributions.
The solution of the optimization problem is a fast approximation to the
Wasserstein metric between two GMMs. The new Aggregated Wasserstein distance is
a semi-metric and can be computed without generating Monte Carlo samples. It is
invariant to relabeling or permutation of states. The distance is defined
meaningfully even for two HMMs that are estimated from data of different
dimensionality, a situation that can arise due to missing variables. This
distance quantifies the dissimilarity of GMM-HMMs by measuring both the
difference between the two marginal GMMs and that between the two transition
matrices. Our new distance is tested on tasks of retrieval, classification, and
t-SNE visualization of time series. Experiments on both synthetic and real data
have demonstrated its advantages in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency in
comparison with existing distances based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

is crucial in many domains. For example, understanding the neural code requires
characterizing how different neurons contribute unique, redundant, or
synergistic pieces of information about sensory or behavioral variables.
Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a partial information decomposition (PID)
which separates the mutual information that a set of sources contains about a
set of targets into nonnegative terms interpretable as these pieces.
Quantifying redundancy requires assigning an identity to different information
pieces, to assess when information is common across sources. Harder et al.
(2013) proposed an identity axiom stating that there cannot be redundancy
between two independent sources about a copy of themselves. However,
Bertschinger et al. (2012) showed that with a deterministically related
sources-target copy this axiom is incompatible with ensuring PID nonnegativity.
Here we study systematically the effect of deterministic target-sources
dependencies. We introduce two synergy stochasticity axioms that generalize the
identity axiom, and we derive general expressions separating stochastic and
deterministic PID components. Our analysis identifies how negative terms can
originate from deterministic dependencies and shows how different assumptions
on information identity, implicit in the stochasticity and identity axioms,
determine the PID structure. The implications for studying neural coding are
discussed.
