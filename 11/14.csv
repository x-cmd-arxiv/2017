under which quantum coherence (QC) is frozen to a nonzero value and show that
the frozen condition (FC) is not so sensitive to the initial condition of

between the quantities characterizing properties of atoms in thermal bath and
show that the enhanced quantum coherence and subradiant state can be gained
from initial state.

galaxies in the core, NGC1387, NGC1379 and NGC1381, at $10\leq R \leq40$~arcmin
($\sim 58 - 230$~kpc) from the central galaxy NGC~1399. We show that the ICL is
the counterpart in the diffuse light of the known over-density in the
population of blue globular clusters (GCs). The total g-band luminosity of the
ICL is $L_g\simeq 8.3 \times 10^{9}$ $L_{\odot}$, which is $\sim5\%$ of the
total luminosity of NGC1399. This is consistent with the fraction of the blue
GCs in the same region of the cluster. The ICL has $g-r \sim 0.7$~mag, which is
similar to the colors in the halo of the bright galaxies in the cluster core.
The new findings were compared with theoretical predictions for the ICL
formation and they support a scenario in which the intra-cluster population
detected in the core of the Fornax cluster is build up by the tidal stripping
of material (stars and GCs) from galaxy outskirts in a close passage with the

positions x velocities x accelerations. Most work in tensor factorization has
addressed the decomposition of dense tensors. In this paper, we build upon the
decomposition of sparse tensors, with only small amounts of nonzero entries.
The decomposition of sparse tensors has successfully been used in relational

has been extended to multi-class classification with discrete input variables.
Representing the data in high dimensional sparse tensors enables the
approximation of complex highly non-linear functions. In this paper we show how

Furthermore, we extend the method to continuous inputs, by learning a mapping
from the continuous inputs to the latent representations of the tensor
decomposition, using basis functions. We evaluate our proposed model on a

active-galactic nuclei are powered by the rotational energy of black holes.
This idea is supported by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
simulations of accreting black holes, which demonstrate efficient energy
extraction via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. However, due to uncertainties in
the physics of mass-loading, and the failure of GRMHD numerical schemes in the
highly-magnetized funnel region, the matter content of the jet remains poorly
constrained. We investigate the observational signatures of mass-loading in the
funnel by performing general-relativistic radiative transfer calculations on a
range of 3D GRMHD simulations of accreting black holes. We find significant
observational differences between cases in which the funnel is empty and cases
where the funnel is filled with plasma, particularly in the optical and X-ray
bands. In the context of Sgr A*, current spectral data constrains the jet
filling only if the black hole is rapidly rotating with $a\gtrsim0.9$. In this
case, the limits on the infrared flux disfavour a strong contribution from
material in the funnel. We comment on the implications of our models for
interpreting future Event Horizon Telescope observations. We also scale our
models to stellar-mass black holes, and discuss their applicability to the
low-luminosity state in X-ray binaries.

Spatio-temporal data differs from relational data for which computational
approaches are developed in the data mining community for multiple decades, in
that both spatial and temporal attributes are available in addition to the
actual measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes introduces
additional challenges that needs to be dealt with. Approaches for mining
spatio-temporal data have been studied for over a decade in the data mining
community. In this article we present a broad survey of this relatively young
field of spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of
spatio-temporal data and the relevant data mining questions that arise in the
context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature of the data
mining problem studied, we classify literature on spatio-temporal data mining
into six major categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection,
frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship mining. We discuss
the various forms of spatio-temporal data mining problems in each of these
categories.

Using this construction, an explicit expression for a generalised frame is
given in the case when the orbits are regular, but subtleties arise when they
become degenerate. In the case of regular orbits, the resulting space is a
globally flat fiber bundle over $\mathcal{O}$ which can be made compact,
allowing for a generalised Scherk-Schwartz reduction. This means these spaces
should admit consistent supergravity truncations. For degenerate orbits, the
procedure hinges on the existence of a suitable metric, allowing for a
consistent normalisation of the generalised frame.

  We introduce a mass conserving Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme for
minimizing the graph Ohta-Kawasaki functional with a mass constraint. We
present three main results: (1) the Lyapunov functionals associated with this
MBO scheme $\Gamma$-converge to the Ohta-Kawasaki functional (which includes
the standard graph based MBO scheme and total variation as a special case); (2)
there is a class of graphs on which the Ohta-Kawasaki MBO scheme corresponds to
a standard MBO scheme on a transformed graph and for which generalized
comparison principles hold; (3) this MBO scheme allows for the numerical
computation of (approximate) minimizers of the graph Ohta-Kawasaki functional

the existence of a secondary He flow likely originating in the outer

coadding hundreds of Ulysses He beam maps together to maximize signal-to-noise,
we identify a weak signal that is credibly associated with the secondary
component. Assuming a laminar flow from infinity, we infer the following He
flow parameters: V=12.8+/-1.9 km/s, lambda=74.4+/-1.8 deg, beta=-10.5+/-4.1
deg, and T=3000+/-1100 K; where lambda and beta are the ecliptic longitude and
latitude direction in J2000 coordinates. The secondary component has a density
that is 4.9+/-0.9% that of the primary component. These measurements are
reasonably consistent with measurements from IBEX, with the exception of
temperature, where our temperature is much lower than IBEX's T=9500 K. Even the
higher IBEX temperature is suspiciously low compared to expectactions for the
outer heliosheath source region. The implausibly low temperatures are due to
the incorrect assumption of a laminar flow instead of a diverging one, given
that the flow in the outer heliosheath source region will be deflecting around
the heliopause. As for why the IBEX and Ulysses T values are different,
difficulties with background subtraction in the Ulysses data are a potential
source of concern, but the discrepancy may also be another effect of the
improper laminar flow assumption, which could affect the IBEX and Ulysses
analyses differently.

this construction the name of Geometric Recursion. As a first application, we
demonstrate that our formalism produce a large class of measurable functions on
the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces. Under certain conditions, the
functions produced by the geometric recursion can be integrated with respect to
the Weil--Petersson measure on moduli spaces with fixed boundary lengths, and
we show that the integrals satisfy a topological recursion generalizing the one

identities, namely that multiplicative statistics of hyperbolic lengths of
multicurves can be computed by the geometric recursion. As a corollary, we show
that the systole function can be obtained from the geometric recursion. The
theory has however a wider scope than functions on Teichm\""uller space, which
will be explored in subsequent papers; one expects that many functorial objects

literature as it allows sharp risk bounds in terms of the problem geometry.
Localized bounds seem to be much less exploited in the Stochastic Optimization
literature. In addition, there is an obvious interest in both communities in
obtaining risk bounds that require weak moment assumptions or
``heavier-tails''. In this work we use a localization toolbox to derive risk
bounds in two specific applications. The first is in portfolio risk
minimization with conditional value-at-risk constraints. We consider a setting
where, among all assets with high returns, there is a portion of dimension $g$,
unknown to the investor, that has significant less risk than the other
remaining portion. Our rates for the SAA problem show that ``risk inflation'',
caused by a multiplicative factor, affects the statistical rate only via a term
proportional to $g$. As the ``normalized risk'' increases, the contribution in
the rate from the extrinsic dimension diminishes while the dependence on $g$ is
kept fixed. Localization is a key tool to show this property. As a second
application of our localization toolbox, we obtain sharp oracle inequalities
for least-squares estimators with a Lasso-type constraint under weak moment
assumptions. One main consequence of these inequalities is to obtain
\emph{persistence}, as posed by Greenshtein and Ritov, with covariates having
heavier tails. This gives improvements in prior work of Bartlett, Mendelson and
Neeman.

  Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the initialization of weights in deep neural networks
can have a dramatic impact on learning speed. For example, ensuring the mean
squared singular value of a network's input-output Jacobian is $O(1)$ is
essential for avoiding the exponential vanishing or explosion of gradients. The
stronger condition that all singular values of the Jacobian concentrate near
$1$ is a property known as dynamical isometry. For deep linear networks,
dynamical isometry can be achieved through orthogonal weight initialization and
has been shown to dramatically speed up learning; however, it has remained
unclear how to extend these results to the nonlinear setting. We address this
question by employing powerful tools from free probability theory to compute
analytically the entire singular value distribution of a deep network's
input-output Jacobian. We explore the dependence of the singular value
distribution on the depth of the network, the weight initialization, and the
choice of nonlinearity. Intriguingly, we find that ReLU networks are incapable
of dynamical isometry. On the other hand, sigmoidal networks can achieve
isometry, but only with orthogonal weight initialization. Moreover, we
demonstrate empirically that deep nonlinear networks achieving dynamical
isometry learn orders of magnitude faster than networks that do not. Indeed, we
show that properly-initialized deep sigmoidal networks consistently outperform
deep ReLU networks. Overall, our analysis reveals that controlling the entire
distribution of Jacobian singular values is an important design consideration
in deep learning.

analysis of the current methods envisioned to optimize fault-tolerant schemes,
which rely on hardware characterization, noise modelling, and numerical
simulations. We show that, even within a very restricted set of noise models,
error correction protocols depend strongly on the details of the noise model.
Combined to the intrinsic difficulty of hardware characterization and of
numerical simulations of fault-tolerant protocols, we arrive at the conclusion
that the currently envisioned optimization cycle is of very limited scope. On
the other hand, the direct characterization of a fault-tolerant scheme on a
small quantum computer bypasses these difficulties, and could provide a

active component has two different active regions. Their longitudinal variation
revealed that one of them has a migration period of 3.95 years, while the other
has a migration period of 8.37 years. Secondly, 225 flares were detected from
the short cadence data in total. The parameters, such as increase (Tr) and
decay (Td) times, total flare time (Tt), equivalent durations (P), were
calculated for each flare. The distribution of equivalent durations versus
total flare times in logarithmic scale is modelled to find flare activity
level. The Plateau value known as the saturation level of the active component
was calculated to be 2.3121+-0.0964 s, and the Half-life value, which is
required flare total time to reach the saturation, was computed to be 2233.6 s.
In addition, the frequency of N1, which is the number of flares per an hour in
the system, was found to be 0.05087 1/h, while the flare frequency N2 that the
flare-equivalent duration emitting per an hour was found to be 0.00051.
Contrary to the spot activity, it has been found that the flares are in tends

  We strengthen existing lower bounds on the error to incorporate the failure

structure of locally private protocols. We further develop these ideas to
obtain the following general results beyond heavy hitters.
  $\bullet$ Advanced Grouposition: In the local model, group privacy for $k$
users degrades proportionally to $\approx \sqrt{k}$, instead of linearly in $k$
as in the central model. Stronger group privacy yields improved max-information
guarantees, as well as stronger lower bounds (via ""packing arguments""), over
the central model.
  $\bullet$ Building on a transformation of Bassily and Smith (STOC 2015), we
give a generic transformation from any non-interactive approximate-private
local protocol into a pure-private local protocol. Again in contrast with the
central model, this shows that we cannot obtain more accurate algorithms by
moving from pure to approximate local privacy.

partitioned (AMP) algorithm extends the previous developments in [1, 2] by
generalizing the added-damping tensors to account for arbitrary
three-dimensional rotations, and by employing a general quadrature for the
surface integral over a rigid body to derive the discrete AMP interface
condition for the fluid pressure. Stability analyses for two three-dimensional
model problems show that the algorithm remains stable for bodies of any mass
when applied to the relevant model problems. The resulting AMP algorithm is
implemented in parallel using a moving composite grid framework to treat one or
more rigid bodies in complex three-dimensional configurations. The new
three-dimensional algorithm is verified and validated though several benchmark
problems, including the motion of a sphere in a viscous incompressible fluid
and the interaction of a bi-leaflet mechanical heart valve and a pulsating
fluid. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the stability analysis
even for complex problems, and show that the AMP algorithm remains stable,
without sub-iterations, for light and even zero-mass three-dimensional rigid
bodies of general shape. These benchmark problems are further used to examine
the parallel performance of the algorithm and to investigate the conditioning
of the linear system for the pressure including the newly derived AMP interface

generative modeling. Posed as a two-player minimax problem, GANs are typically
trained end-to-end on real-valued data and can be used to train a generator of

that training relies on passing gradients from the discriminator through the
generator via back-propagation. This makes it fundamentally difficult to train
GANs with discrete data, as generation in this case typically involves a
non-differentiable function. These difficulties extend to the reinforcement
learning setting when the action space is composed of discrete decisions. We
address these issues by reframing the GAN framework so that the generator is no
longer trained using gradients through the discriminator, but is instead
trained using a learned critic in the actor-critic framework with a Temporal

mass as a double power-law, ii) it always has a peak in the mass range explored
and iii) it is $3-5$ times larger for spirals than for ellipticals. The results
have some dependence on the adopted SHMR and we provide fitting formulae in

mass where the stellar-to-halo mass ratio $f_\ast = M_\ast/M_{\rm h}$ has a
maximum. This is mostly driven by the straightness and tightness of the Fall
relation, which requires $f_j$ and $f_\ast$ to be correlated with each other
roughly as $f_j\propto f_\ast^{2/3}$, as expected if the outer and more angular
momentum rich parts of a halo failed to accrete onto the central galaxy and
form stars (biased collapse). We also confirm that the difference in the
angular momentum of spirals and ellipticals at a given mass is too large to be
ascribed only to different spins of the parent dark-matter haloes (spin bias).

formed from the disk. The metric we propose can be employed with upcoming

good agreement with conventional methods to measure bar formation in

giants on elongated orbits. Their metallicity distribution is rather broad,
with roughly half of the stars having [M/H] $\ge -1$ dex. The use of different

whether this transport is turbulent in nature, is a fundamental issue in planet
formation studies. Recent ALMA observations have suggested that turbulent
velocities in the outer regions of these disks are less than ~5-10% of the
sound speed, contradicting theoretical predictions of turbulence driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). These observations have generally been
interpreted to be consistent with a large-scale laminar magnetic wind driving
accretion. Here, we carry out local, shearing box simulations with varying
ionization levels and background magnetic field strengths in order to determine
which parameters produce results consistent with observations. We find that
even when the background magnetic field launches a strong largely laminar wind,
significant turbulence persists and is driven by localized regions of vertical
magnetic field (the result of zonal flows) that are unstable to the MRI. The
only conditions for which we find turbulent velocities below the observational
limits are weak background magnetic fields and ionization levels well below
that usually assumed in theoretical studies. We interpret these findings within
the context of a preliminary model in which a large scale magnetic field,
confined to the inner disk, hinders ionizing sources from reaching large radial
distances, e.g., through a sufficiently dense wind. Thus, in addition to such a

many-body systems, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) has been an invaluable
tool for elucidating the spectral properties and quantum phases of both
phenomenological models and ab initio descriptions of real materials. Key to
the DMFT process is the self-consistent map of the original system into an
Anderson impurity model, the ground state of which is computed using an
impurity solver. The power of the method is thus limited by the complexity of
the impurity model the solver can handle. Simulating realistic systems
generally requires many correlated sites. By adapting the recently proposed
adaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) method as an impurity
solver, we enable much more efficient zero temperature DMFT simulations. The
key feature of the ASCI method is that it selects only the most relevant
Hilbert space degrees of freedom to describe the ground state. This reduces the
numerical complexity of the calculation, which will allow us to pursue future
DMFT simulations with more correlated impurity sites than in previous works.
Here we present the ASCI-DMFT method and example calculations on the
one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models that exemplify its efficient
convergence and timing properties. We show that the ASCI approach is several
orders of magnitude faster than the current best published ground state DMFT
simulations, which allows us to study the bath discretization error in
simulations with small clusters, as well as to address cluster sizes beyond the
current state of the art. Our approach can also be adapted for other embedding
methods such as density matrix embedding theory and self-energy embedding
theory.

Moreover, whether spacetime SUSY in 2+1 and higher dimensions can occur or

realization of a \textit{single} Dirac fermion with attractive Hubbard
interactions that preserves both time-reversal and chiral symmetries. By
performing numerically-exact sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo

remarkably, we demonstrate that the ${\mathcal N}$=2 spacetime SUSY in 2+1D
emerges at the superconducting QCP by showing that the fermions and bosons have
\textit{identical} anomalous dimensions 1/3, a hallmark of the emergent SUSY.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of emergent 2+1D
spacetime SUSY in quantum microscopic models. We further show some experimental
signatures which can be measured to test such emergent SUSY in candidate
systems such as the surface of 3D topological insulators.

the Sun. This universality of the r-process is one of its characteristic
features as well as one of the most important clues to its astrophysical
origin. We report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor field giant with
[Sr,Ba/H] $\approx$ -6.0 and [Sr, Ba/Fe] $\approx$ -3.0, the lowest abundances
of strontium and barium relative to iron ever observed. Despite its low
abundances, the star 2MASS J151113.24-213003.0 has [Sr/Ba] = -0.11 +/- 0.14 and
therefore its neutron-capture abundances are consistent with the main solar
r-process pattern that has [Sr/Ba] = -0.25. It has been suggested that
extremely low neutron-capture abundances are a characteristic of dwarf
galaxies, and we find that this star is on a highly-eccentric orbit with
apocenter $\gtrsim$100 kpc that lies in the disk of satellites in the halo of
the Milky Way. We show that other extremely metal-poor stars with low [Sr,Ba/H]

consistent with a dwarf galaxy origin for this class of object. The
nucleosynthesis event that produced the neutron-capture elements in 2MASS

solar ratio. We exclude contributions from the s-process in intermediate-mass
AGB or fast-rotating massive metal-poor stars, pair-instability supernovae, the
weak r-process, and neutron-star mergers. We argue that the event was a Pop III

multi-waveband data from the optical to infrared, to select Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs) at z~3 using U-V and V-R colors in the Subaru Deep Field. With
the resulting sample of 5161 LBGs, we construct the UV luminosity function down
to $M_{UV} = -18$ and find a steep faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.78 \pm 0.05$.
We analyze rest-frame UV-to-IR spectral energy distributions generated from the
median optical photometry and photometry on median-stacked IR images. In the
stacks of faint LBGs, we find a background depression centered on the galaxy.
This deficit results from the systematic difficulty of SExtractor in finding
faint galaxies in regions with higher-than-average surface densities of
foreground galaxies. We corrected our stacked magnitudes for this. Best-fit
stellar population templates for the stacked LBG SEDs indicate stellar masses
and star-formation rates of log M*/Msun = 10 and 50 M$_\odot$/yr at i' = 24,
down to log M*/Msun = 8 and = 3 M$_\odot$/yr at i' = 27. For the faint stacked
LBGs there is a 1-mag excess over the expected stellar continuum in the K-band,
which we attribute to redshifted [OIII]4959+5007 and H$\beta$ lines. Their
implied equivalent widths increase with decreasing mass, reaching $\rm{EW_0([O
III]4959,5007+H\beta)}$ =1500A in the faintest bin. Such strong [OIII] emission
is seen only in a miniscule fraction of the most extreme local emission-line
galaxies, but it probably universal in the faint galaxies that reionized the
universe. Finally, we analyze clustering by computing the angular correlation
function and performing halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis. We find a
mean dark halo mass of log(Mhalo/h) Msun = 11.29$\pm 0.12$ for the full sample
of LBGs, and log(Mhalo/h) Msun = 11.49$\pm 0.1$ for the brightest half.

FIRE project reproduce the properties of ultra diffuse galaxies. We show that
stellar feedback-generated outflows that dynamically heat galactic stars,
together with a passively aging stellar population after imposed quenching
(from e.g. infall into a galaxy cluster), naturally reproduce the observed
population of red UDGs, without the need for high spin halos or dynamical
influence from their host cluster. We reproduce the range of surface
brightness, radius and absolute magnitude of the observed z=0 red UDGs by
quenching simulated galaxies at a range of different times. They represent a
mostly uniform population of dark matter-dominated galaxies with M_star ~1e8
Msun, low metallicity and a broad range of ages. The most massive simulated
UDGs require earliest quenching and are therefore the oldest. Our simulations
provide a good match to the central enclosed masses and the velocity
dispersions of the observed UDGs (20-50 km/s). The enclosed masses of the
simulated UDGs remain largely fixed across a broad range of quenching times
because the central regions of their dark matter halos complete their growth
early. A typical UDG forms in a dwarf halo mass range of Mh~4e10-1e11 Msun. The
most massive red UDG in our sample requires quenching at z~3 when its halo
reached Mh ~ 1e11 Msun. If it, instead, continues growing in the field, by z=0
its halo mass reaches > 5e11 Msun, comparable to the halo of an L* galaxy. If
our simulated dwarfs are not quenched, they evolve into bluer low-surface
brightness galaxies with mass-to-light ratios similar to observed field dwarfs.
While our simulation sample covers a limited range of formation histories and
halo masses, we predict that UDG is a common, and perhaps even dominant, galaxy
type around Ms~1e8 Msun, both in the field and in clusters.

successful in either the Dirac or Majorana neutrino mass scenario. In the Dirac
mass scenario, gravitational leptogenesis predicts a relic abundance of sterile
neutrinos that remain out of equilibrium, and the lepton asymmetry carried by
the standard model sector is unchanged. In the Majorana mass scenario, the
neutrinos participate in lepton-number-violating interactions that threaten to
washout the lepton asymmetry during post-inflationary reheating. However, we
show that a complete (exponential) washout of the lepton asymmetry is prevented
if the lepton-number-violating interactions go out of equilibrium before all of
the standard model Yukawa interactions come into equilibrium. The baryon and
lepton asymmetries carried by right-chiral quarks and leptons are sequestered
from the lepton-number violation, and the washout processes only suppress the
predicted baryon asymmetry by a factor of $\varepsilon_{\rm w.o.} = \pm
O(0.1)$. The sign of $\varepsilon_{\rm w.o.}$ depends on the model parameters

Posner molecules form. The transformation points to a natural computational
basis for qubits in Posner molecules. From the basis, we construct a quantum
code that detects arbitrary single-qubit errors. Each molecule encodes one
qutrit. Shifting from information storage to computation, we define the model
of Posner quantum computation. To illustrate the model's quantum-communication
ability, we show how it can teleport information incoherently: A state's
weights are teleported. Dephasing results from the entangling operation's
simulation of a coarse-grained Bell measurement. Whether Posner quantum
computation is universal remains an open question. However, the model's
operations can efficiently prepare a Posner state usable as a resource in
universal measurement-based quantum computation. The state results from
deforming the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state and is a projected
entangled-pair state (PEPS). Finally, we show that entanglement can affect
molecular-binding rates, boosting a binding probability from 33.6% to 100% in

we provide a concrete realisation of this ring in terms of Bessel functions. We
consider a weak coupling expansion in each topological sector and write it as a
finite number of perturbative corrections plus an infinite series of
instanton-anti-instanton contributions. To be able to apply resurgent analysis
we then consider a non-supersymmetric deformation of the localized model by
introducing a small unbalance between the number of bosons and fermions. The
perturbative expansion of the deformed model becomes asymptotic and we analyse
it within the framework of resurgence theory. Although the perturbative series
truncates when we send the deformation parameter to zero we can still
reconstruct non-perturbative physics out of the perturbative data in a nice
example of Cheshire cat resurgence in quantum field theory. We also show that
the same type of resurgence takes place when we consider an analytic
continuation in the number of chiral fields from $N$ to $r\in\mathbb{R}$.
Although for generic real $r$ supersymmetry is still formally preserved, we
find that the perturbative expansion of the supersymmetric partition function

magnetic field and irradiated by the central star. The radial structure of
these disks was studied by Shu and collaborators and the vertical structure was
studied by Lizano and collaborators. We consider disks around low mass
protostars, T Tauri stars, and FU Ori stars with different mass-to-flux ratios
$\lambda_{\rm sys}$. We calculate the spectral energy distribution and the
antenna temperature profiles at 1 mm and 7 mm convolved with the ALMA and VLA
beams. We find that disks with weaker magnetization (high values of
$\lambda_{\rm sys}$) emit more than disks with stronger magnetization (low
values of $\lambda_{\rm sys}$). This happens because the former are denser,
hotter and have larger aspect ratios, receiving more irradiation from the
central star. The level of magnetization also affects the optical depth at
millimeter wavelengths, being larger for disks with high $\lambda_{\rm sys}$.
In general, disks around low mass protostars and T Tauri stars are optically
thin at 7 mm while disks around FU Ori are optically thick. A qualitative
comparison of the emission of these magnetized disks, including heating by an
external envelope, with the observed millimeter antenna temperature profiles of
HL Tau indicates that large cm grains are required to increase the optical
depth and reproduce the observed 7 mm emission at large radii.

obtain an estimate of their average total-to-selective attenuation
$k(\lambda)$. The attenuation curves are found to be shallower at UV
wavelengths with increasing inclination, whereas the shape at longer
wavelengths remains unchanged. The highest inclination subpopulation (b/a<0.42)
exhibits a NUV excess in its average selective attenuation, which, if
interpreted as a 2175\AA\ feature, is best fit with a bump strength of 17-26%
of the MW value. No excess is apparent in the average attenuation curve of
lower inclination galaxies. The differential reddening between the stellar
continuum and ionized gas is found to decrease with increasing inclination. We
find that higher inclination galaxies have slightly higher values of $R_V$,
although this is poorly constrained given the uncertainties. We outline
possible explanations for these trends within a two component dust model (dense
cloud+diffuse dust) and find that they can be naturally explained if carriers
of the 2175\AA\ feature are preferentially destroyed in star-forming regions

  2017, Garmisch-Partenkirchen",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The RoboPol instrument and the relevant program was developed in order to
conduct a systematic study of the optical polarisation variability of blazars.
Driven by the discovery that long smooth rotations of the optical polarisation
plane can be associated with the activity in other bands and especially in
gamma rays, the program was meant to investigate the physical mechanisms
causing them and quantify the optical polarisation behaviour in blazars. Over
the first three nominal observing seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) RoboPol
detected 40 rotations in 24 blazars by observing a gamma-ray-loud and
gamma-ray-quite unbiassed sample of blazars, providing a reliable set of events
for exploring the phenomenon. The obtain datasets provided the ground for a
systematic quantification of the variability of the optical polarisation in
such systems. In the following after a brief review of the discoveries that
relate to the gamma-ray loudness of the sources we move on to discuss a simple
jet model that explains the observed dichotomy in terms of polarisation between
gamma-ray-loud and quite sources and the dependence of polarisation and the
stability of the polarisation angle on the synchrotron peak frequency.

from a merger of neutron stars has placed an extremely stringent bound on the
speed of GW. We showed previously that the presence of gravitational slip
($\eta$) in cosmology is intimately tied to modifications of GW propagation.
This new constraint implies that the only remaining viable source of
gravitational slip is a conformal coupling to gravity in scalar-tensor
theories, while viable vector-tensor theories cannot now generate gravitational
slip at all. We discuss structure formation in the remaining viable models,
demonstrating that (i) the dark-matter growth rate must now be at least as fast
as in GR, with the possible exception of the beyond Horndeski model. (ii) If
there is any scale-dependence at all in the slip parameter, it is such that it
takes the GR value at large scales. We show a consistency relation which must
be violated if gravity is modified.

learning method. Specifically, we show how decision trees represent a
non-compensatory decision protocol known as disjunctions-of-conjunctions and
how this protocol generalizes many of the non-compensatory rules used in the
discrete choice literature so far. Additionally, we show how existing decision
tree variants address many economic concerns that choice modelers might have.
Beyond theoretical interpretations, we contribute to the existing literature of
two-stage, semi-compensatory modeling and to the existing decision tree
literature. In particular, we formulate the first bayesian model tree, thereby
allowing for uncertainty in the estimated non-compensatory rules as well as for
context-dependent preference heterogeneity in one's second-stage choice model.
Using an application of bicycle mode choice in the San Francisco Bay Area, we
estimate our bayesian model tree, and we find that it is over 1,000 times more
likely to be closer to the true data-generating process than a multinomial
logit model (MNL). Qualitatively, our bayesian model tree automatically finds
the effect of bicycle infrastructure investment to be moderated by travel
distance, socio-demographics and topography, and our model identifies
diminishing returns from bike lane investments. These qualitative differences
lead to bayesian model tree forecasts that directly align with the observed
bicycle mode shares in regions with abundant bicycle infrastructure such as
Davis, CA and the Netherlands. In comparison, MNL's forecasts are overly
optimistic.

samples are combined into samples from a single target posterior. The diversity
of the framework is demonstrated on parameter estimation from differential

constant plateau (A(Li)~2.2 dex) and then the upper envelope of the lithium vs.
metallicity distribution increases as we approach solar metallicity.
Meteorites, which carry information about the chemical composition of the
interstellar medium at the solar system formation time, show a lithium
abundance A(Li)~3.26 dex. This pattern reflects the Li enrichment history of
the interstellar medium during the Galaxy lifetime. After the initial Li
production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the sources of the enrichment include
AGB stars, low-mass red giants, novae, type II supernovae, and Galactic cosmic
rays. The total amount of enriched Li is sensitive to the relative contribution
of these sources. Thus different Li enrichment histories are expected in the
Galactic thick and thin disc. We investigate the main sequence stars observed
with UVES in Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 catalog and find a Li-[alpha/Fe]
anticorrelation independent of [Fe/H], Teff, and log(g). Since in stellar
evolution different {\alpha} enhancements at the same metallicity do not lead
to a measurable Li abundance change, the anticorrelation indicates that more Li
is produced during the Galactic thin disc phase than during the Galactic thick
disc phase. We also find a correlation between the abundance of Li and
s-process elements Ba and Y, and they both decrease above the solar
metallicity, which can be explained in the framework of the adopted Galactic

devices used in assistive reproductive technologies remains illusive. Recently,
a novel microfluidic device featuring periodic post arrays has been developed,
and shown to select sperm cells with better motility, morphology and DNA

we present a multi-scale model that aims to provide insight physical insight
into the motility behavior of sperm in such periodic geometries. Our model
combines a fluctuating hydrodynamic model of sperm with a probabilistic
discrete-time lattice approach, and we show how hydrodynamic and boundary
interactions facilitate both the enhancement of speed and persistence length of
sperm cells in this post array. We then discuss how this enhancement of
flagellar transport is related to its propensity, and develop a phase diagram.
Our findings not only shed light into the fluid physics of flagellar swimmers

participants are not randomized to treatment. Observational studies in
infectious disease research present the additional challenge that one
participant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i.e., there
may be interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects
in the presence of interference are considered, and new causal estimands
designed specifically for use with observational studies are proposed.
Previously defined estimands target counterfactual scenarios in which
individuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in
settings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it
may be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in
the same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe counterfactual
scenarios in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as
in the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in
the individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for
policy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of
increasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse
probability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The
large-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study
demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented. The
proposed methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a study of cholera
vaccination in over 100,000 individuals in Bangladesh.

called dense if its support is equal to a coset in $\mathfrak{h}^{*}/Q$.
Following a conjecture of V. Futorny about affine Kac-Moody algebras
$\mathfrak{g}$, an irreducible weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module is dense if and
only if it is cuspidal (i.e. not a quotient of an induced module). The
conjecture is confirmed for $\mathfrak{g}=A_{2}^{\left(1\right)}$,

left-over finitely many cases an algorithm is proposed, which leads to the
solution of Futorny's conjecture for the cases $A_{2}^{\left(1\right)}$ and
$A_{3}^{\left(1\right)}$. Yet, the solution of the case

the past few decades. However, most of the previous studies only focus on
single-value prediction. Considering the uncertain and chaotic nature of the
transportation system, an accurate and reliable prediction interval with upper
and lower bounds may be better than a single point value for transportation
management. In this paper, we introduce a neural network model called Extreme
Learning Machine (ELM) for interval prediction of short-term traffic volume and
improve it with the heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The
hybrid PSO-ELM model can generate the prediction intervals under different
confidence levels and guarantee the quality by minimizing a multi-objective
function which considers two criteria reliability and interval sharpness. The
PSO-ELM models are built based on an hourly traffic dataset and compared with
ARMA and Kalman Filter models. The results show that ARMA models are the worst
for all confidence levels, and the PSO-ELM models are comparable with Kalman
Filter from the aspects of reliability and narrowness of the intervals,
although the parameters of PSO-ELM are fixed once the training is done while
Kalman Filter is updated in an online approach. Additionally, only the PSO-ELMs
are able to produce intervals with coverage probabilities higher than or equal
to the confidence levels. For the points outside of the prediction levels given
by PSO-ELMs, they lie very close to the bounds.

non-processive molecular motors. In our model, the motors change states by
random discrete events (corresponding to stepping and binding/unbinding), while
the cargo position follows a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that
depends on the discrete states of the motors. The resulting system for the
cargo position is consequently an SDE that randomly switches according to a
Markov jump process governing motor dynamics. To study this system we (1) cast
the cargo position in a renewal theory framework and generalize the renewal
reward theorem and (2) decompose the continuous and discrete sources of
stochasticity and exploit a resulting pair of disparate timescales. With these
mathematical tools, we obtain explicit formulas for experimentally measurable
quantities, such as cargo velocity and run length. Analyzing these formulas
then yields some predictions regarding so-called non-processive clustering, the
phenomenon that a single motor cannot transport cargo, but that two or more
motors can. We find that having motor stepping, binding, and unbinding rates
depend on the number of bound motors, due to geometric effects, is necessary
and sufficient to explain recent experimental data on non-processive motors.

predictor processes are both sparsely sampled on random time points and are
contaminated with random errors. In addition, the random times are allowed to
be different for the measurements of the predictor and the response functions.
The aforementioned situation often occurs in the longitudinal data settings. To
estimate the covariance and the cross-covariance functions we use a
regularization method over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The estimate of
the cross-covarinace function is used to obtain an estimate of the regression
coefficient function and also functional singular components. We derive the
convergence rates of the proposed cross-covariance, the regression coefficient
and the singular component function estimators. Furthermore, we show that,
under some regularity conditions, the estimator of the coefficient function has
a minimax optimal rate. We conduct a simulation study and demonstrate merits of
the proposed method by comparing it to some other existing methods in the
literature. We illustrate the method by an example of an application to a well
known multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.

sensory input. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the
stochastic binding of signaling molecules at low concentrations. Using
chemotaxis of sperm cells as application example, we address the classic
problem of chemotaxis towards a single target. We reveal a fundamental
relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of
directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in the
chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between slow, but
reliable, and fast, but less reliable, steering.
  By formulating the problem of optimal navigation in the presence of noise as
a Markov decision process, we show that dynamic switching between reliable and
fast steering substantially increases the probability to find a target, such as
the egg. Intriguingly, this decision making would provide no benefit in the
absence of noise. Instead, decision making is most beneficial, if chemical
signals are above detection threshold, yet signal-to-noise ratios of gradient
measurements are low. This situation generically arises at intermediate
distances from a target, where signaling molecules emitted by the target are
diluted, thus defining a `noise zone' that cells have to cross.
  Our work addresses the intermediate case between well-studied perfect
chemotaxis at high signal-to-noise ratios close to a target, and random search
strategies in the absence of navigation cues, e.g. far away from a target. Our
specific results provide a rational for the surprising observation of decision
making in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. The general theory
demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high
levels of noise in gradient measurements by dynamically adjusting the
persistence length of a biased persistent random walk.

function and the constraints. The step is computed as a sum between a
steepest-descent step (which minimizes the objective functional) and a
correction step related to the Newton method(which aims to solve the equality
constraints). The linear combination between these two steps involves
coefficients similar to Lagrange multipliers which are computed in a natural
way based on the Newton method. The algorithm uses no projection and thus the
iterates are not feasible; the constraints are satisfied only in the limit
(after convergence). This algorithm was proposed by one of the authors in a
previous paper. In the present paper, a local convergence result is proven for
a general non-linear setting, where both the objective functional and the
constraints are not necessarily convex functions. The algorithm is extended, by
means of an active set strategy, to account also for inequality constraints and
to address minimax problems. The method is then applied to the optimization of
periodic microstructures for obtaining homogenized elastic tensors having
negative Poisson ratio (so-called auxetic materials) using shape and/or
topology variations in the model hole. In previous works of the same authors,
anisotropic homogenized tensors have been obtained which exhibit negative
Poisson ratio in a prescribed direction of the plane. In the present work, a
new approach is proposed, that employs multi-objective optimization in order to
minimize the Poisson ratio of the (possibly anisotropic) homogenized elastic
tensor in several prescribed directions of the plane. Numerical examples are

Structure in Galaxies (S4G) to investigate how the presence of bars in spiral
galaxies depends on mass, colour, and gas content and whether large, SDSS-based
investigations of bar frequencies agree with local data. Bar frequency reaches
a maximum of $\approx 0.70$ at $M_{\star} \sim 10^{9.7} M_{\odot}$, declining
to both lower and higher masses. It is roughly constant over a wide range of
colours ($g - r \approx 0.1$-0.8) and atomic gas fractions ($\log (M_{HI} /
M_{\star}) \approx -2.5$ to 1). Bars are thus as common in blue, gas-rich
galaxies are they are in red, gas-poor galaxies. This is in sharp contrast to
many SDSS-based studies of $z \sim 0.01$-0.1 galaxies, which report f_bar
increasing strongly to higher masses (from $M_{\star} \sim 10^{10}$ to $10^{11}
M_{\odot}$), redder colours, and lower gas fractions. The contradiction can be
explained if SDSS-based studies preferentially miss bars in, and underestimate
the bar fraction for, lower-mass (bluer, gas-rich) galaxies due to poor spatial
resolution and the correlation between bar size and stellar mass. Simulations
of SDSS-style observations using the S4G galaxies as a parent sample, and
assuming that bars below a threshold angular size of twice the PSF FWHM cannot
be identified, successfully reproduce typical SDSS f_bar trends for stellar
mass and gas mass ratio. Similar considerations may affect high-redshift
studies, especially if bars grow in length over cosmic time; simulations
suggest that high-redshift bar fractions may thus be systematically
underestimated.

We summarize current constraints from BBN and the CMB on this brane-world dark
radiation term. At the same time, the existence of extra dimensions during the
earlier inflation impacts the tensor to scalar ratio and the running spectral
index as measured in the CMB. We summarize how the constraints on inflation
shift when embedded in higher dimensions. Finally, one expects that the

the early moments of chaotic inflation. We summarize the quest for cosmological
evidence of the birth of space-time out of the string theory landscape. We will
explore the possibility that a superstring excitations may have made itself
known via a coupling to the field of inflation. This may have left an imprint
of ""dips"" in the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic
microwave background. The identification of this particle as a superstring is
possible because there may be evidence for different oscillator states of the
same superstring that appear on different scales on the sky. It will be shown
that from this imprint one can deduce the mass, number of oscillations, and
coupling constant for the superstring. Although the evidence is marginal, this
may constitute the first observation of a superstring in Nature.

power generation-demand imbalances. In future power electronic-based power
systems, the same role can be played by strategically located virtual inertia
devices. However, the question looms large as to how the system operators would

consider a linear network reduced power system model along with a robust
$\mathcal{H}_2$ performance metric penalizing the worst-case primary control
effort. With a social welfare maximization problem for the system operator as a
benchmark, we construct a market mechanism in which bids are invited from
agents providing virtual inertia, who in turn are compensated via a
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payment rule. The resulting mechanism ensures truthful
bidding to be the dominant bidding strategy and guarantees non-negative payoffs

procedure, taking the form of a simple projection operator, is in the core of
our methodology. Provided a shape database, a graph encapsulating the
structural relationships among all the available shapes, is first constructed
and then employed in defining low-dimensional sparse projections. The recently
introduced method of CRPs (collaborative representation based projections),
which is based on L2-Graph, is the first variant that is included towards this
end. A second algorithm, that particularizes the CRPs to shape descriptors that
are inherently nonnegative, is also introduced as potential alternative. In
both cases, the weights in the graph reflecting the database structure are
calculated so as to approximate each shape as a sparse linear combination of
the remaining dataset objects. By way of solving a generalized eigenanalysis
problem, a linear matrix operator is designed that will act as the feature
extractor. Two popular, inherently high dimensional descriptors, namely
ShapeDNA and Global Point Signature (GPS), are employed in our experimentations
with SHREC10, SHREC11 and SCHREC 15 datasets, where shape recognition is cast
as a multi-class classification problem that is tackled by means of an SVM
(support vector machine) acting within the reduced dimensional space of the
crafted projections. The results are very promising and outperform state of the
art methods, providing evidence about the highly discriminative nature of the
introduced 3D shape representations.

Fermi's work on cosmic rays, the new mystery of coronal heating and, as
scientific perception of interplanetary space shifted dramatically and the
space race started, detection of Alfv\'en waves in the solar wind. From then
on, interest in MHD waves boomed, laying the foundations for modern remote
observations of MHD waves in the Sun, coronal seismology and some of today's
leading theories of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. In 1970,
Alfv\'en received the Nobel Prize for his work in MHD, including these
discoveries. The article concludes with some reflection about what the history
implies about the way we do science, especially the advantages and pitfalls of

rule based on a non-uniform sample, it is of interest to estimate the rule's
error rate when applied to unobserved members of the population. Efron (1986)
proposed a general class of covariance penalty inflated prediction error
estimators that assume the available training data are representative of the

Efron's estimator to the complex sample context by incorporating
Horvitz-Thompson sampling weights and show that it is consistent for the true
generalization error rate when applied to the underlying superpopulation. The
resulting Horvitz-Thompson-Efron (HTE) estimator is equivalent to dAIC, a

However, new techniques using near infrared spectra show promising results.
Using these, we determine stellar parameters and metallicities for a sample of
16 M-dwarf stars, 11 of which host planets, with near-infrared spectra from the
Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). We find that M-dwarfs with planets
are preferentially metal-rich compared to those without planets. This result,
based on GNIRS spectra, is supported by the analysis of a relatively larger
sample of M stars with planets (18 in total) and a control sample of 213 M
stars without known planets, obtained from the catalogue of Terrien et al.
(2015). This, on the one hand, coincides with the trend (not only for M- but
also for solar-type stars) reported in the literature and, on the other hand,
demonstrates the utility of GNIRS spectra to obtain reliable stellar parameters
of M stars. We also find that M dwarfs that harbor giant planets are
preferentially more metallic than those associated with low-mass planets
(Neptune or super-Earth type). This trend also agrees with that previously
reported for solar-type stars. These results would favor the core accretion

superfluidity persists for values of dipolar interaction strength for which the

  discrete events","8 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a class of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes where the
state evolves according to a linear dynamical system. This continuous time
evolution is interspersed by discrete events that occur at random times and
change (reset) the state based on a linear affine map. In particular, we
consider two families of discrete events, with the first family of resets
occurring at exponentially-distributed times. The second family of resets is
generally-distributed, in the sense that, the time intervals between events are
independent and identically distributed random variables that follow an
arbitrary continuous positively-valued probability density function. For this
class of stochastic systems, we provide explicit conditions that lead to finite
stationary moments, and the corresponding exact closed-form moment formulas.
These results are illustrated on an example drawn from systems biology, where a
protein is expressed in bursts at exponentially-distributed time intervals,
decays within the cell-cycle, and is randomly divided among daughter cells when
generally-distributed cell-division events occur. Our analysis leads to novel
results for the mean and noise levels in protein copy numbers, and we decompose
the noise levels into components arising from stochastic expression, random
cell-cycle times, and partitioning. Interestingly, these individual noise
contributions behave differently as cell division times become more random. In
summary, the paper expands the class of stochastic hybrid systems for which
statistical moments can be derived exactly without any approximations, and
these results have applications for studying random phenomena in diverse areas.

operator is a key computational task in many areas of applied mathematics and
computational physics. An important case, especially in quantum physics, is the
computation of the spectrum of a Schr\""odinger operator with a disordered
potential. Unlike plane waves or Bloch waves that arise as Schr\""odinger
eigenfunctions for periodic and other ordered potentials, for many forms of
disordered potentials the eigenfunctions remain essentially localized in a very
small subset of the initial domain. A celebrated example is Anderson
localization, for which, in a continuous version, the potential is a piecewise
constant function on a uniform grid whose values are sampled independently from
a uniform random distribution. We present here a new method for approximating
the eigenvalues and the subregions which support such localized eigenfunctions.
This approach is based on the recent theoretical tools of the localization
landscape and effective potential. The approach is deterministic, predicting
quantities that depend sensitively on the particular realization, rather than
furnishing statistical or probabilistic results about the spectrum associated
to a family of potentials with a certain distribution. These methods, which
have only been partially justified theoretically, enable the calculation of the
locations and shapes of the approximate supports of the eigenfunctions, the
approximate values of many of the eigenvalues, and of the eigenvalue counting
function and density of states, all at the cost of solving a single source
problem for the same elliptic operator. We study the effectiveness and
limitations of the approach through extensive computations in one and two
dimensions, using a variety of piecewise constant potentials with values
sampled from various different correlated or uncorrelated random distributions.

In this paper, we propose a user-centric biometric authentication scheme

templates remain encrypted such that the server will never see them directly.
However, the server is able to determine whether the distance of two encrypted

no critical information of the templates can be revealed under both passive and

the inner product of x and y can be evaluated and compared to a pre-defined

prevents over-fitting well in low resource languages and 2) boosts tagging
accuracy for rare / unseen words. We also demonstrate that 3) the improved
tagging performance by AT contributes to the downstream task of dependency
parsing, and that 4) AT helps the model to learn cleaner word representations.
5) The proposed AT model is generally effective in different sequence labeling
tasks. These positive results motivate further use of AT for natural language
tasks.

was associated with a mini-filament eruption and a GOES B1.9 micro-fare in the
quiet Sun region. The initiation of the event was due to the photospheric
magnetic emergence and cancellation in the eruption source region, which first
caused the ejection of a small plasma ejecta, then the ejecta impacted on a
nearby mini-filament and thereby led to the filament's eruption and the
associated fare. During the filament eruption, an EUV wave at a speed of 182 {
317 km/s was formed ahead of an expanding coronal loop, which propagated faster
than the expanding loop and showed obvious deceleration and refection during
the propagation. In addition, the EUV wave further resulted in the transverse
oscillation of a remote filament whose period and damping time are 15 and 60
minutes, respectively. Based on the observational results, we propose that the
small-scale EUV wave should be a fast-mode magnetosonic wave that was driven by
the the expanding coronal loop. Moreover, with the application of filament
seismology, it is estimated that the radial magnetic field strength is about 7
Gauss. The observations also suggest that small-scale EUV waves associated with
miniature solar eruptions share similar driving mechanism and observational
characteristics with their large-scale counterparts.

Rossby waves) has been rare. Here we derive the expected frequency ranges of r
modes in the observational frame by considering the visibility of these modes.
We find that the frequencies of r modes of azimuthal order $m$ appear as groups
at slightly lower frequency than $m$ times the rotation frequency. Comparing
the visibility curves for r modes with Fourier amplitude spectra of Kepler
light curves of upper main-sequence B, A and F stars, we find that r modes are
present in many $\gamma$ Dor stars (as first discovered by Van Reeth et al.
2016), spotted stars, and so-called Heartbeat stars, which are highly eccentric
binary stars. We also find a signature of r modes in a frequently bursting Be
star observed by Kepler. In the amplitude spectra of moderately to rapidly
rotating $\gamma$ Dor stars, r-mode frequency groups appear at lower frequency
than prograde g-mode frequency groups, while in the amplitude spectra of
spotted early A to B stars, groups of symmetric (with respect to the equator)
r-mode frequencies appear just below the frequency of a structured peak that we
suggest represents an approximate stellar rotation rate. In many Heartbeat
stars, a group of frequencies can be fitted with symmetric $m=1$ r modes, which
can be used to obtain rotation frequencies of these stars.

Recently, it was proved that the upper error bound of this method can achieve a

$O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\exp(-\frac{\pi-\delta}{2}n))$, where $0<\delta<\pi$ is
the bandwidth and $n$ the number of sample data. The convergence rate is by far
the best convergence rate among all regularized methods for the Shannon

incompressible viscous flow problems with moderate Reynolds number. The
proposed method allows utilizing identical finite dimensional spaces (with
arbitrary B-splines/NURBS order and regularity) for the approximation of the
pressure and velocity components. The key idea is to stabilize the jumps of
high-order derivatives of variables over the skeleton of the mesh. For
B-splines/NURBS basis functions of degree $k$ with $C^{\alpha}$-regularity ($0
\leq \alpha < k$), only the derivative of order $\alpha +1$ has to be
controlled. This stabilization technique thus can be viewed as a
high-regularity generalization of the (Continuous) Interior-Penalty Finite
Element Method. Numerical experiments are performed for the Stokes and
Navier-Stokes equations in two and three dimensions. Oscillation-free solutions
and optimal convergence rates are obtained. In terms of the sparsity pattern of
the algebraic system, we demonstrate that the block matrix associated with the
stabilization term has a considerably smaller bandwidth when using B-splines
than when using Lagrange basis functions, even in the case of $C^0$-continuity.
This important property makes the proposed isogeometric framework practical

methods in computational biology is that data may not be accurately labeled due
to the time and resources required for experimentally annotating properties of
proteins and DNA sequences. Standard supervised learning algorithms assume
accurate instance-level labeling of training data. Multiple instance learning
is a paradigm for handling such labeling ambiguities. However, the widely used
large-margin classification methods for multiple instance learning are
heuristic in nature with high computational requirements. In this paper, we
present stochastic sub-gradient optimization large margin algorithms for
multiple instance classification and ranking, and provide them in a software
suite called pyLEMMINGS.
  Results: We have tested pyLEMMINGS on a number of bioinformatics problems as
well as benchmark datasets. pyLEMMINGS has successfully been able to identify
functionally important segments of proteins: binding sites in Calmodulin
binding proteins, prion forming regions, and amyloid cores. pyLEMMINGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance in all these tasks, demonstrating the value of
multiple instance learning. Furthermore, our method has shown more than
100-fold improvement in terms of running time as compared to heuristic
solutions with improved accuracy over benchmark datasets.

volume effects on the chiral phase transition, especially the influence on the
position of the possible pseudo-critical end point (pCEP). The results show
that in the chiral limit case (the current quark mass $m=0$), the absolute
value of quark condensate decreases for smaller volumes, and more
interestingly, so does the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c(\mu=0)$, which is
in agreement with the Polyakov Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model result and opposite to
the Polyakov linear sigma model prediction. These conclusions hold for $m>0$
case in our calculations. Moreover, the results of pCEP as a function of
different volumes show that $T$ of pCEP also decreases for smaller volumes, but
$\mu$ of pCEP will increase, which are qualitatively more close to Polyakov
linear sigma model results. For our model setup, results for systems with a
size larger than (5 fm)$^3$ closely approximate those from infinite volume, but
if the volume is smaller, the corrections are non-negligible, even
significantly affect signatures of the results from an infinite system. There
also exists some possibility that, if the system size is too small, the whole
phase transition would be crossover, which means no pCEP exists at all. It is
no doubt that, finite volume effects deserve further researches.

revealed that, in the simplest model of glasses, i.e., the harmonic potential
system, phonon modes coexist with soft localized modes in the low-frequency

more realistic models is still controversial. In the present work, we study the

coexistence of the phonon modes and the soft localized modes in the continuum

that the low-frequency vibrations are rather sensitive to the numerical scheme
of potential truncation which is usually implemented in the MD simulation, and
this is the reason why contradictory arguments have been reported by previous
works. We also discuss the physical origin of this sensitiveness by means of a
linear stability analysis.

bursts observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) on 2015/09/21. The
source region for each burst splits from one dominant component at higher
frequencies into two increasingly-separated components at lower frequencies.
For channels below ~132 MHz, the two components repetitively diverge at high
speeds (0.1-0.4 c) along directions tangent to the limb, with each episode
lasting just ~2 s. We argue that both effects result from the strong magnetic
field connectivity gradient that the burst-driving electron beams move into.
Persistence mapping of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) jets observed by the Solar
Dynamics Observatory reveals quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) associated with
coronal null points, including separatrix dome, spine, and curtain structures.
Electrons are accelerated at the flare site toward an open QSL, where the beams
follow diverging field lines to produce the source splitting, with larger
separations at larger heights (lower frequencies). The splitting motion within
individual frequency bands is interpreted as a projected time-of-flight effect,
whereby electrons traveling along the outer field lines take slightly longer to
excite emission at adjacent positions. Given this interpretation, we estimate
an average beam speed of 0.2 c. We also qualitatively describe the quiescent
corona, noting in particular that a disk-center coronal hole transitions from
being dark at higher frequencies to bright at lower frequencies, turning over
around 120 MHz. These observations are compared to synthetic images based on
the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model, which we use to

to the effective charge-transfer energy, while changes in the on-site Coulomb
interactions have little effect on the details of the dispersion. In
particular, our result highlights the splitting between spin excitations along

addresses an important aspect of refueling in the context of routing multiple
small UAVs to complete a surveillance or data collection mission. Specifically,
this article formulates a multiple-UAV routing problem with the refueling
constraint of minimizing the overall fuel consumption for all of the vehicles
as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with uncertainty associated with
the fuel consumption of each vehicle. The two-stage model allows for the
application of sample average approximation (SAA). Although the SAA solution
asymptotically converges to the optimal solution for the two-stage model, the
SAA run time can be prohibitive for medium- and large-scale test instances.
Hence, we develop a tabu-search-based heuristic that exploits the model
structure while considering the uncertainty in fuel consumption. Extensive
computational experiments corroborate the benefits of the two-stage model
compared to a deterministic model and the effectiveness of the heuristic for
obtaining high-quality solutions.

atom-PTI separation. Remarkably, the sign of the recoil force is polarization
and orientation-independent, and it occurs in a translation-invariant
homogeneous system in thermal equilibrium. Surprisingly, the recoil force
persists for very small values of the gyration pseudovector, which, for a
biased plasma, corresponds to very low cyclotron frequencies. The ultra-strong
recoil force is rooted on the quasi-hyperbolic dispersion of the

shown that under the Markov approximation the force has resonant and

both in terms of the system Green function and of the electromagnetic modes. We
apply the theory to the particular case wherein a two-level system interacts

exotic light-matter interactions and the opportunity to sculpt and tune the

dataset is a challenging task. With enough images at hand, one can hope that a
deep CNN characterizes localized artifacts over the entire data and their
effect on the output. However, on smaller datasets, such deep CNNs may overfit
and shallow ones find it hard to capture local artifacts. Thus some image-based
small-data applications first train their framework on a collection of patches
(instead of the entire image) to better learn the representation of localized
artifacts. Then the output is obtained by averaging the patch-level results.
Such an approach ignores the spatial correlation among patches and how various
patch locations affect the output. It also fails in cases where few patches
mainly contribute to the image label. To combat these scenarios, we develop the
notion of hyper-image representations. Our CNN has two stages. The first stage
is trained on patches. The second stage utilizes the last layer representation
developed in the first stage to form a hyper-image, which is used to train the
second stage. We show that this approach is able to develop a better mapping
between the image and its output. We analyze additional properties of our
approach and show its effectiveness on one synthetic and two real-world vision
tasks - no-reference image quality estimation and image tampering detection -
by its performance improvement over existing strong baselines.

However noise can improve performance too, due to a process called stochastic
resonance (SR). This paradoxical effect may be exploited in psychophysical
experiments, to provide additional insights into how the sensory system deals
with noise. Here, I develop a model for stochastic resonance to study the
influence of noise on human perception, in which the biological parameter of
`lapse rate' was included. I show that the inclusion of lapse rate allows for
the occurrence of stochastic resonance in terms of the performance metric d'.
At the same time, I show that high levels of lapse rate cause stochastic
resonance to disappear. It is also shown that noise generated in the brain
(i.e., internal noise) may obscure any effect of stochastic resonance in
experimental settings. I further relate the model to a standard equivalent
noise model, the linear amplifier model, and show that the lapse rate can
function to scale the threshold versus noise (TvN) curve, similar to the
efficiency parameter in equivalent noise (EN) models. Therefore, lapse rate
provides a psychophysical explanation for reduced efficiency in EN paradigms.
Furthermore, I note that ignoring lapse rate may lead to an overestimation of
internal noise in equivalent noise paradigms. Overall, describing stochastic
resonance in terms of signal detection theory, with the inclusion of lapse
rate, may provide valuable new insights into how human performance depends on
internal and external noise.

iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$ entries. Under certain assumptions on the parameters, an
intriguing assymptotic gap appears between the minimum value of $n$, call it
$n^*$, for which the recovery is information theoretically possible, and the
minimum value of $n$, call it $n_{\mathrm{alg}}$, for which an efficient
algorithm is known to provably recover $\beta^*$. In \cite{gamarnikzadik} it
was conjectured that the gap is not artificial, in the sense that for sample
sizes $n \in [n^*,n_{\mathrm{alg}}]$ the problem is algorithmically hard.
  We support this conjecture in two ways. Firstly, we show that the optimal
solution of the LASSO provably fails to $\ell_2$-stably recover the unknown
vector $\beta^*$ when $n \in [n^*,c n_{\mathrm{alg}}]$, for some sufficiently
small constant $c>0$. Secondly, we establish that $n_{\mathrm{alg}}$, up to a
multiplicative constant factor, is a phase transition point for the appearance
of a certain Overlap Gap Property (OGP) over the space of $k$-sparse vectors.
The presence of such an Overlap Gap Property phase transition, which originates
in statistical physics, is known to provide evidence of an algorithmic
hardness. Finally we show that if $n>C n_{\mathrm{alg}}$ for some large enough
constant $C>0$, a very simple algorithm based on a local search improvement
rule is able both to $\ell_2$-stably recover the unknown vector $\beta^*$ and
to infer correctly its support, adding it to the list of provably successful
algorithms for the high dimensional linear regression problem.

classical Wythoff game. The latter game is played with two piles of stones, and
two players take turns removing stones from one or both piles; when removing
stones from both piles, the numbers of stones removed from each pile must be
equal. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. An
equivalent description of the game is that a single chess queen is placed
somewhere on a large grid of squares, and each player can move the queen
towards the upper left corner of the grid: leftward, upward, or to the upper
left, any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into
the upper left corner. In Wythoff's game with a pass, we modify the standard
rules of the game so as to allow for a one-time pass, i.e., a pass move which
may be used at most once in a game, and not from a terminal position. Once the
pass has been used by either player, it is no longer available. The author
discovered that, when a pass move is available, the set of
$\mathcal{P}$-positions (previsous player's position) of the Wythoff's game
with a pass is equal to $ T_0 \cup T_1\cup B -A$, where $T_0 = \{(x,y):
\mathcal{G}(x,y)=0 \}$, $T_0 = \{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=1 \}$, $B$ is a finite
subset of $\{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=4 \}$, $A$ is a finite subset of $T_0$ and
$\mathcal{G}$ is the Grundy number of the classical Wythoff game. Here the size
of $B$ is $6$, and the size of $A$ is $7$. According to the research of U.Blass
and A.S.Fraenkel, for a position $(x,y) \in T_1 $ there is always a position
$(x^{\prime},y^{\prime}) \in T_0$ such that $\mid x- x^{\prime} \mid \leq 2$
and $\mid y - y^{\prime} \mid \leq 4$, and hence the graph of the set of
$\mathcal{P}$-positions of the Wythoff's game with a pass is very similar to
the graph of the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions of the classical Wythoff's
game.

difference ($T_A \ne T_B$), it can operate as a heat engine, rectifying thermal
fluctuations to perform work. While it has attracted much interest, the
operation of Feynman's ratchet as a heat engine has not been realized

ratchet with a colloidal particle in a one dimensional optical trap in contact

other reservoir is generated by a novel feedback mechanism, using the
Metropolis algorithm to impose detailed balance. We verify that the system does

getting popularity among users because of their usefulness in day-to-day life.
LBSs are information services that use geospatial data of mobile device and
smart phone users to provide information, entertainment and security in real
time. A key concern in such pervasive computing environment is the need to
reveal the user's exact location which may allow an adversary to infer private
information about the user. To address the privacy concerns of LBS users, a
large number of security approaches have been proposed based on the concept of
k-anonymity. The central idea in location k-anonymity is to find a set of k-1
users confined in a given geographical area of the actual user, such that the
location of these k users are indistinguishable from one another, thus
protecting the identity of the user. Although a number of performance
parameters like success rate, amount of privacy achieved are used to measure
the performance of the k-anonymity approaches, they make the implicit,
unrealistic assumption that the k-1 users are readily available. As such these
approaches ignore the turnaround time to process a user request, which is
crucial for a real-time application like LBS. In this work, we model the
k-anonymity approaches using queuing theory to compute the average sojourn time
of users and queue length of the system. To demonstrate that queuing theory can
be used to model all k-anonymity approaches, we consider graph-based
k-anonymity approaches. The proposed analytical model is further validated with
experimental results.

problem, where a job on its arrival reveals its payoff $v$, however, the
deadline is hidden to the online algorithm, which could potentially be chosen
adversarially and known to the optimal offline algorithm. The objective is to
derive a robust (to deadlines) and optimal online algorithm that achieves the
best competitive ratio. We propose an algorithm (called min-LCR) and show that
it is an optimal online algorithm for any convex energy cost function $g(.)$.
We do so without actually evaluating the optimal competitive ratio, and give a
general proof that works for any convex $g$, which is rather novel. For the
popular choice of energy cost function $g(k) = k^\alpha, \alpha \ge 2$, we give
concrete bounds on the competitive ratio of the algorithm, which ranges between

  Automatic Text Scoring","Accepted to AAAI 2018",,,,"cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous potential for Automatic Text
Scoring (ATS) tasks. In this paper, we describe a new neural architecture that
enhances vanilla neural network models with auxiliary neural coherence
features. Our new method proposes a new \textsc{SkipFlow} mechanism that models
relationships between snapshots of the hidden representations of a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network as it reads. Subsequently, the semantic
relationships between multiple snapshots are used as auxiliary features for
prediction. This has two main benefits. Firstly, essays are typically long
sequences and therefore the memorization capability of the LSTM network may be
insufficient. Implicit access to multiple snapshots can alleviate this problem
by acting as a protection against vanishing gradients. The parameters of the
\textsc{SkipFlow} mechanism also acts as an auxiliary memory. Secondly,
modeling relationships between multiple positions allows our model to learn
features that represent and approximate textual coherence. In our model, we
call this \textit{neural coherence} features. Overall, we present a unified
deep learning architecture that generates neural coherence features as it reads
in an end-to-end fashion. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on the benchmark ASAP dataset, outperforming not only feature
engineering baselines but also other deep learning models.

crystalline nuclei at initial stage of the shear-induced crystallization of a
model single-component amorphous (glassy) system. These characteristics are
estimated quantitatively through statistical treatment of the non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulation results for the system under steady shear at
various (fixed) values of the shear rate $\dot\gamma$ and at different
temperatures. It is found that the sheared glassy system is crystallized
through nucleation mechanism. From analysis of a time-dependent trajectories of
the largest crystalline nuclei, the critical size $n_{c}$ and the nucleation
time $\tau_{c}$ were defined. It is shown that the critically-sized nuclei in
the system are oriented within the shear-gradient $xy$-plane at moderate and
high shear rates; and a tilt angle of the oriented nuclei depends on the shear
rate. At extremely high shear rates and at shear deformation of the system more
than $60$\%, the tilt angle of the nuclei tends to take the value
$\simeq45^\circ$ respective to the shear direction. We found that this feature
depends weakly on the temperature. Asphericity of the nucleus shape increases
with increasing shear rate, that is verified by increasing value of the
asphericity parameter and by the contour of the pair distribution function
calculated for the particles of the critically-sized nuclei. The critical size
increases with increasing shear rate according to the power-law,
$n_{c}\propto(\dot\gamma\tau_{c})^{1/3}$, whereas the shape of the
critically-sized nucleus changes from spherical to the elongated ellipsoidal.
We found that the $n_{c}$-dependencies of the nuclei deformation parameter
evaluated for the system at different temperatures and shear rates are
collapsed into unified master-curve.

discrete time-varying systems over sensor networks. Firstly, it is shown that a
networked Kalman filter with optimal gain parameter is actually a centralized
filter, since it requires each sensor to have global information which is
usually forbidden in large networks. Then, a sub-optimal distributed Kalman
filter (DKF) is proposed by employing the covariance intersection (CI) fusion
strategy. It is proven that the proposed DKF is of consistency, that is, the
upper bound of error covariance matrix can be provided by the filter in real
time. The consistency also enables the design of adaptive CI weights for better
filter precision. Furthermore, the boundedness of covariance matrix and the
convergence of the proposed filter are proven based on the strong connectivity
of directed network topology and the global observability which permits the
sub-system with local sensor's measurements to be unobservable. Meanwhile, to
keep the covariance of the estimation error bounded, the proposed DKF does not
require the system matrix to be nonsingular at each moment, which seems to be a
necessary condition in the main DKF designs under global observability.
Finally, simulation results of two examples show the effectiveness of the
algorithm in the considered scenarios.

both reactions, suggesting the dominance of $K^{*}$ exchange in the $t$

a maximum value of +0.6 for both reactions. Comparison with theoretical
predictions based on the Regge trajectory in the $t$ channel and the

number of scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio)physical and
biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and
organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is
limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial
resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular
protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately,
recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' far-field
optical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion
(STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical
(fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy
(PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured
illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy
(SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial
resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold
improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy,
STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of
optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all
super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because
the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution
microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain
when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the
road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical
microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need
for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a
collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a
thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical
microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label
optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in
which these methods will have a significant impact.

heterogeneous nucleation on dislocations, coupled with radiation-induced solute

Furthermore, we establish the relationship between consensus step, SEC and

Employing a space decomposition method, we show the error covariance in the

condition based on SEC, which is milder than existing observability conditions.
Under the ECO condition, through utilizing a technique of matrix approximation,
we prove the boundedness of error covariance and the exponentially asymptotic
unbiasedness of state estimate, respectively. Moreover, under the ECO condition
for linear time-invariant systems with SEC, we provide a novel event-triggered
communication protocol by employing the consistency, and give an offline design
principle of triggering thresholds with guaranteed boundedness of error
covariance. More importantly, we quantify and analyze the communication rate

rigorous modal analysis of complicated plasmonic resonators, being not limited

remarkable computation speeds. We particularly show that, when the number of

steady-states for the different driving forces that influence the

for other testing and review activities. For this we need to have a clear
understanding of how the defects found by bug finding tools relate to the
defects found by other techniques. This paper describes a case study using
several projects mainly from an industrial environment that were used to
analyse the interrelationships. The main finding is that the bug finding tools
predominantly find different defects than testing but a subset of defects found
by reviews. However, the types that can be detected are analysed more
thoroughly. Therefore, a combination is most advisable if the high number of
false positives of the tools can be tolerated.

uncertainties, for example due to extra-mixing or the possible inaccurate
position of the transition from convective to radiative transport of energy.
These have a strong impact on stellar models and their fundamental parameters.
The most promising method to reduce these uncertainties is to use
asteroseismology to derive diagnostics probing the structural characteristics
of these regions. Aims. We wish to use custom-made integrated quantities to
improve the capabilities of seismology to probe convective regions in stellar
interiors. We hope to increase the number of indicators obtained with
structural seismic inversions to provide additional constraints on stellar
models and the fundamental parameters determined from theoretical modeling.
Methods. First, we present new kernels associated with a proxy of the entropy
in stellar interiors. We then show how these kernels can be used to build
custom-made integrated quantities probing convective regions inside stellar
models. We present two indicators suited to probe convective cores and
envelopes, respectively, and test them on artificial data. Results. We show
that it is possible to probe both convective cores and envelopes using
appropriate indicators obtained with structural inversion techniques. These
indicators provide direct constraints on a proxy of the entropy of the stellar
plasma, sensitive to the characteristics of convective regions. These
constraints can then be used to improve the modeling of solar-like stars by
providing an additional degree of selection of models obtained from classical
forward modeling approaches. We also show that in order to obtain very accurate
indicators, we need l = 3 modes for the envelope but that the core-conditions
indicator is more flexible in terms of the seismic data required for its use.

with possibly different sizes is considered. With limited energy, the source
cannot potentially transmit all bits of all packets. In addition, there is a
delay cost associated with each packet. Thus, the source has to choose, how
many bits to transmit for each packet, and the order in which to transmit these
bits, to minimize the cost of distortion (introduced by transmitting lower
number of bits) and queueing plus transmission delay, across all packets.
Assuming an exponential metric for distortion loss and linear delay cost, we
show that the optimization problem is jointly convex. Hence, the problem can be
exactly solved using convex solvers, however, because of the complicated
expression derived from the KKT conditions, no closed form solution can be
found even with the simplest cost function choice made in the paper, also the
optimal order in which packets should be transmitted needs to be found via
brute force. To facilitate a more structured solution, a discretized version of
the problem is also considered, where time and energy are divided in discrete
amounts. In any time slot (fixed length), bits belonging to any one packet can
be transmitted, while any discrete number of energy quanta can be used in any
slot corresponding to any one packet, such that the total energy constraint is
satisfied. The discretized problem is a special case of a multi-partitioning
problem, where each packet's utility is super-modular and the proposed greedy
solution is shown to incur cost that is at most $2$-times of the optimal cost.

microscope and an environmental chamber, allows to obtain very stable
sub-critical fracture propagation in oxide glasses under controlled
environment, and subsequently to finely characterize the nanometric roughness
properties of the crack surfaces. The analysis of the surface roughness is
conducted both in terms of the classical root mean square roughness to compare
with the literature, and in terms of more physically adequate indicators
related to the self-affine nature of the fracture surfaces. Due to the
comparable nanometric scale of the surface roughness, the AFM tip size and the
instrumental noise, a special care is devoted to the statistical evaluation of
the metrologic properties. The 2 roughness amplitude of several oxide glasses
was shown to decrease as a function of the stress intensity factor, to be quite
insensitive to the relative humidity and to increase with the degree of
heterogeneity of the glass. The results are discussed in terms of several
modeling arguments concerning the coupling between crack propagation,
material's heterogeneity, crack tip plastic deformation and water diffusion at
the crack tip. A synthetic new model is presented combining the predictions of
a model by Wiederhorn et al. [1] on the effect of the material's heterogeneity
on the crack tip stresses with the self-affine nature of the fracture surfaces.

enhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory

more neurosomes in a neurosome-based 2D code, the whole strongly connected

resonance in hybrid semiconductor-insulator-metallic waveguide cavity at room

analysis (RMEN-CCA) for multiple view unsupervised learning problems, which
emphasizes the combination of CCA and the robust matrix elastic net (RMEN) used
as coupled feature selection. The RMEN-CCA leverages the strength of the RMEN
to distill naturally meaningful features without any prior assumption and to
measure effectively correlations between different 'views'. We can further
employ directly the kernel trick to extend the RMEN-CCA to the kernel scenario
with theoretical guarantees, which takes advantage of the kernel trick for
highly complicated nonlinear feature learning. Rather than simply incorporating
existing regularization minimization terms into CCA, this paper provides a new
learning paradigm for CCA and is the first to derive a coupled feature
selection based CCA algorithm that guarantees convergence. More significantly,
for CCA, the newly-derived RMEN-CCA bridges the gap between measurement of
relevance and coupled feature selection. Moreover, it is nontrivial to tackle
directly the RMEN-CCA by previous optimization approaches derived from its
sophisticated model architecture. Therefore, this paper further offers a bridge
between a new optimization problem and an existing efficient iterative
approach. As a consequence, the RMEN-CCA can overcome the limitation of CCA and
address large-scale and streaming data problems. Experimental results on four
popular competing datasets illustrate that the RMEN-CCA performs more
effectively and efficiently than do state-of-the-art approaches.

contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization. It has been known that the
escape fractions estimated by observations and numerical simulations show a
large diversity. However, the origins of the diversity are still uncertain. In
this work, to understand what quantities of galaxies are responsible for
controlling the escape fraction, we numerically evaluate the escape fraction by
performing ray-tracing calculation with simplified disc galaxy models. With a
smooth disc model, we explore the dependence of the escape fraction on the
disposition of ionizing sources, and find that the escape fraction varies up to
$\sim 3$ orders of magnitude. It is also found that the halo mass dependence of
disc scale height determines whether the escape fraction increases or decreases
with halo mass. With a clumpy disc model, it turns out that the escape fraction
increases as the clump mass fraction increases because the density in the
inter-clump region decreases. In addition, we find that clumpiness regulates
the escape fraction via two ways when the total clump mass dominates the total
gas mass; the escape fraction is controlled by the covering factor of clumps if
the clumps are dense sufficient to block LyC photons, otherwise the clumpiness
works to reduce the escape fraction by increasing the total number of
recombination events in a galaxy.

minimizers of the spatial $N$-body problem with equal masses under $D_N$ or

constraints. This generalizes a previous result by the author in \cite{Y15c}
for the planar $N$-body problem. In particular, the monotone constraints
required in \cite{Y15c} are proven to be unnecessary, as it will be implied by
the action minimization property.
  For each type of topological constraints, by considering the corresponding
action minimization problem in a coordinate frame rotating around the vertical
axis at a constant angular velocity $\om$, we find an entire family of simple
choreographies (seen in the rotating frame), as $\om$ changes from $0$ to $N$.
Such a family starts from one planar linear chain and ends at another (seen in
the original non-rotating frame). The action minimizer is collision-free, when
$\om=0$ or $N$, but may contain collision for $0 < \om < N$. However all
possible collisions must be binary and each collision solution is $C^0$
block-regularizable.
  Moreover for certain types of topological constraints, based on results from
\cite{BT04} and \cite{CF09}, we show that when $\om$ belongs to some
sub-intervals of $[0, N]$, the corresponding minimizer must be a rotating
regular $N$-gon contained in the horizontal plane. As a result, this
generalizes Marchal's $P_{12}$ family of the three body problem to arbitrary $N

allowing for an elegant symmetric decomposition into two single population
symmetric games. Specifically, we show how an asymmetric bimatrix game (A,B)
can be decomposed into its symmetric counterparts by envisioning and
investigating the payoff tables (A and B) that constitute the asymmetric game,
as two independent, single population, symmetric games. We reveal several
surprising formal relationships between an asymmetric two-population game and
its symmetric single population counterparts, which facilitate a convenient
analysis of the original asymmetric game due to the dimensionality reduction of
the decomposition. The main finding reveals that if (x,y) is a Nash equilibrium
of an asymmetric game (A,B), this implies that y is a Nash equilibrium of the
symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table A, and x is a Nash
equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table B.
Also the reverse holds and combinations of Nash equilibria of the counterpart
games form Nash equilibria of the asymmetric game. We illustrate how these
formal relationships aid in identifying and analysing the Nash structure of
asymmetric games, by examining the evolutionary dynamics of the simpler
counterpart games in several canonical examples.

trick, we interpret this combination as a convolution of an impulsive skeletal
density and primitive kernels with conical support, which faithfully embeds
into the convolution formulation of interactions across different objects. Our
approach enables fusion of search-efficient combinatorial data structures
prevalent in time-critical collision and proximity queries with analytic
methods popular in path planning and protein docking, and outperforms uniform
grid-based FFT methods by leveraging nonequispaced FFTs. We provide example
applications in formulating holonomic collision constraints, shape

comparative case study of three software development projects where the effect
of TDD on program design was measured using object-oriented metrics. The
results show that the effect of TDD on program design was not as evident as
expected, but the test coverage was significantly superior to iterative

capture the semi-classical fluctuations, but the first one leads to spurious
flat modes of finite frequency not present in the second one. Both methods lead
to the same physical conclusions otherwise: long-range N\'eel-type order is
likely for the square lattice for $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ with two particles per site,
but quantum fluctuations probably destroy order for more than two particles per

larger than the classical order parameter for the tripartite triangular lattice

from academic societies and associations to public elections. In such
elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced;
that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can
vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any
theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der
Straeten, 2016).
  This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths
under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and
voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length
restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium
outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid.
Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias
second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash
equilibria.
  The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional
features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes
when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On
the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties
which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in
the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a
stark trade-off between stable and desirable election outcomes.

electronics and optoelectronics, to achieve required charge carrier
concentrations by means of chemical doping remains a challenge, due to large
defect ionization energies (IEs). Here by decomposing the defect IEs into the
neutral single-electron defect level, the structural relaxation energy gain,
and the electronic relaxation energy cost, we propose a conceptual picture that
the large defect IEs are caused by two effects of reduced dimensionality. While
the quantum confinement effect (QCE) makes the neutral single-electron point
defect levels deep, the reduced screening effect (RE) leads to high energy cost
for the electronic relaxation. The first-principles calculations for monolayer,
few-layer, and bulk black phosphorus (BP), MoS2, and ReS2 with strong, medium,
and weak interlayer interactions, respectively, as examples, do demonstrate the
general trend. Based on the gained insight into defect behaviors, strategies
can be envisaged for reducing defect IEs and improving charge carrier doping.
Using BP monolayer either embedded into dielectric continuum or encapsulated
between two h-BN layers, as practical examples, we demonstrate the feasibility
of increasing the screening to reduce the defect IEs and boost carrier
concentration. Our analysis is expected to help achieving effective carrier
doping and thus to open ways towards more extensive applications of 2D
semiconductors.

clarifies the role of illumination on the electronic band structure of TIs by
revealing its dual effect: downward band bending on very small timescales
followed by band flattening at large timescales. Our results therefore allow us

objects as well as to the understanding of shape properties. The literature on
graphs and networks have contributed to the structural characterization of
shapes with different theoretical approaches. We performed a study on the
relationship between the shape architecture and the network topology
constructed over the shape boundary. For that, we used a method for network
modeling proposed in 2009. Firstly, together with curvature analysis, we
evaluated the proposed approach for regular polygons. This way, it was possible
to investigate how the network measurements vary according to some specific
shape properties. Secondly, we evaluated the performance of the proposed shape
descriptor in classification tasks for three datasets, accounting for both
real-world and synthetic shapes. We demonstrated that not only degree related
measurements are capable of distinguishing classes of objects. Yet, when using
measurements that account for distinct properties of the network structure, the
construction of the shape descriptor becomes more computationally efficient.
Given the fact the network is dynamically constructed, the number of iterations
can be reduced. The proposed approach accounts for a more robust set of
structural measurements, that improved the discriminant power of the shape
descriptors.

guiding search algorithms with heuristics (estimates of the distance from any
state to the goal). A popular way for creating heuristic functions is by using
an abstract version of the state space. However, the quality of
abstraction-based heuristic functions, and thus the speed of search, can suffer
from spurious transitions, i.e., state transitions in the abstract state space
for which no corresponding transitions in the reachable component of the
original state space exist. Our first contribution is a quantitative study
demonstrating that the harmful effects of spurious transitions on heuristic
functions can be substantial, in terms of both the increase in the number of
abstract states and the decrease in the heuristic values, which may slow down
search. Our second contribution is an empirical study on the benefits of
removing a certain kind of spurious transition, namely those that involve
states with a pair of mutually exclusive (mutex) variablevalue assignments. In
the context of state space planning, a mutex pair is a pair of variable-value
assignments that does not occur in any reachable state. Detecting mutex pairs
is a problem that has been addressed frequently in the planning literature. Our
study shows that there are cases in which mutex detection helps to eliminate
harmful spurious transitions to a large extent and thus to speed up search
substantially.

recommendation. Benefit from the natural characteristics of RNN, the hidden

the Andromeda galaxy (M31) has been recently published by the Fermi-LAT
collaboration, reporting that the emission broadly resembles the so-called
Galactic center excess (GCE) of the Milky Way (MW). At the same time, evidence
is accumulating on a millisecond pulsar (MSPs) origin for the GCE. These
elements prompt us to compare the mentioned observations with what is, perhaps,
the simplest model for an MSP population, solely obtained by rescaling of the
MSP luminosity function determined in the local MW disk via the respective
stellar mass of the systems. It is remarkable that without free fitting
parameters, this model can account for both the energetics and the morphology
of the GCE within uncertainties. For M31, the estimated luminosity due to
primordial MSPs is expected to contribute only about a quarter of the detected
emission, although a dominant contribution cannot be excluded given the large
uncertainties. If correct, the model predicts that the M31 disk emission due to
MSP is not far below the present upper bound. We also discuss a few refinements
of this simple model. In particular, we use the correlation between globular
cluster gamma-ray luminosity and stellar encounter rate to gauge the dynamical
MSP formation in the bulge. This component is expected to contribute to the GCE
only at a level $\lesssim 5\%$, but it may be of some importance in explaining
the signal's morphology in the inner region of the Galaxy. We also comment on
some effects which may lead to violations of the simple scaling used, on

drawn considerable attention to the field of automatic food analysis. Focusing
on self-service restaurants environment, automatic food analysis is not only
useful for extracting nutritional information from foods selected by customers,
it is also of high interest to speed up the service solving the bottleneck
produced at the cashiers in times of high demand. In this paper, we address the
problem of automatic food tray analysis in canteens and restaurants
environment, which consists in predicting multiple foods placed on a tray
image. We propose a new approach for food analysis based on convolutional
neural networks, we name Semantic Food Detection, which integrates in the same
framework food localization, recognition and segmentation. We demonstrate that
our method improves the state of the art food detection by a considerable
margin on the public dataset UNIMIB2016 achieving about 90% in terms of
F-measure, and thus provides a significant technological advance towards the
automatic billing in restaurant environments.

gravitational potential wells, hence their star formation activity is more
sensitive to feedback effects. The shape of the faint-end of the high-$z$
galaxy luminosity function (LF) contains important information on star
formation and its interaction with the reionization process during the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR). High-$z$ galaxies with $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim-17$ have only
recently become accessible thanks to the Frontier Fields (FFs) survey combining
deep {\it HST} imaging and the gravitational lensing effect. In this paper we
investigate the faint-end of the LF at redshift $>$5 using the data of FFs
clusters Abell 2744 (A2744), MACSJ0416.1-2403 (M0416), MACSJ0717.5+3745 (M0717)
and MACSJ1149.5+2223 (M1149). We analyze both an empirical and a
physically-motivated LF model to obtain constraints on a possible turn-over of
LF at faint magnitudes. In the empirical model the LF drops fast when the
absolute UV magnitude $M_{\rm UV}$ is much larger than a turn-over absolute UV
magnitude $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm T}$. We obtain $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm T}\gtrsim-14.6 $
(15.2) at 1 (2) $\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.) for $z\sim6$. In the
physically-motivated analytical model, star formation in halos with circular
velocity below $v_c^*$ is fully quenched if these halos are located in ionized
regions. Using updated lensing models and new additional FFs data, we
re-analyze previous constraints on $v_c^*$ and $f_{\rm esc}$ presented by
Castellano et al. 2016a (C16a) using a smaller dataset. We obtain new
constraints on $v_c^*\lesssim 59$ km s$^{-1}$ and $f_{\rm esc}\lesssim 56\%$
(both at 2$\sigma$ C.L.) and conclude that there is no turn-over detected so
far from the analyzed FFs data. Forthcoming {\it JWST} observations will be key
to tight these constraints further.

ultra-sparse graph proxies have been extensively studied for accelerating
various numerical and graph-related applications. Prior nearly-linear-time
spectral sparsification methods first extract low-stretch spanning tree from
the original graph to form the backbone of the sparsifier, and then recover
small portions of spectrally-critical off-tree edges to the spanning tree to
significantly improve the approximation quality. However, it is not clear how
many off-tree edges should be recovered for achieving a desired spectral
similarity level within the sparsifier. Motivated by recent graph signal
processing techniques, this paper proposes a similarity-aware spectral graph
sparsification framework that leverages efficient spectral off-tree edge
embedding and filtering schemes to construct spectral sparsifiers with
guaranteed spectral similarity (relative condition number) level. An iterative
graph densification scheme is introduced to facilitate efficient and effective
filtering of off-tree edges for highly ill-conditioned problems. The proposed
method has been validated using various kinds of graphs obtained from public
domain sparse matrix collections relevant to VLSI CAD, finite element analysis,
as well as social and data networks frequently studied in many machine learning

Einstein's general relativity (GR). Modifications to GR are expected when
curvatures are near Planckian and appear in string theory or supergravity. But
can such theories describe gravity on length scales much larger than the Planck
cutoff length scale? Here we find causality constraints on Lovelock theories
that arise from the requirement that the equations of motion (EOM) of
perturbations be hyperbolic. We find a general expression for the ""effective
metric"" in field space when Lovelock theories are perturbed around some
symmetric background solution. In particular, we calculate explicitly the
effective metric for a general Lovelock theory perturbed around cosmological
Friedman-Robertson-Walker backgrounds and for some specific cases when
perturbed around Schwarzschild-like solutions. For the EOM to be hyperbolic,
the effective metric needs to be Lorentzian. We find that, unlike for GR, the
effective metric is generically not Lorentzian when the Lovelock modifications
are significant. So, we conclude that Lovelock theories can only be considered
as perturbative extensions of GR and not as truly modified theories of gravity.
We compare our results to those in the literature and find that they agree with

fields for a sample of five intermediate mass T Tauri stars and one low mass T
Tauri star from late-F to mid-K spectral types. While magnetic fields of T
Tauri stars at the low mass range have been extensively characterized, our work
complements previous studies towards the intermediate mass range; this
complementary study is key to evaluate how magnetic fields evolve during the
transition from a convective to a radiative core.
  Methods. We studied the Zeeman broadening of magnetically sensitive spectral
lines in the H-band spectra obtained with the CRIRES high-resolution
near-infrared spectrometer. These data are modelled using magnetic spectral
synthesis and model atmospheres. Additional constraints on non-magnetic line
broadening mechanisms are obtained from modelling molecular lines in the K band
or atomic lines in the optical wavelength region.
  Results. We detect and measure mean surface magnetic fields for five of the
six stars in our sample: CHXR 28, COUP 107, V2062 Oph, V1149 Sco, and Par 2441.
Magnetic field strengths inferred from the most magnetically sensitive
diagnostic line range from 0.8 to 1.8 kG. We also estimate a magnetic field
strength of 1.9 kG for COUP 107 from an alternative diagnostic. The magnetic
field on YLW 19 is the weakest in our sample and is marginally detected, with a
strength of 0.8 kG.
  Conclusions. We populate an uncharted area of the pre-main-sequence HR
diagram with mean magnetic field measurements from high-resolution
near-infrared spectra. Our sample of intermediate mass T Tauri stars in general
exhibits weaker magnetic fields than their lower mass counterparts. Our
measurements will be used in combination with other spectropolarimetric studies
of intermediate mass and lower mass T Tauri stars to provide input into
pre-main-sequence stellar evolutionary models.

  Fairness","Added new experimental results and a slightly modified fairness
  definition",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most prevalent notions of fairness in machine learning are statistical
definitions: they fix a small collection of pre-defined groups, and then ask
for parity of some statistic of the classifier across these groups. Constraints
of this form are susceptible to intentional or inadvertent ""fairness
gerrymandering"", in which a classifier appears to be fair on each individual
group, but badly violates the fairness constraint on one or more structured
subgroups defined over the protected attributes. We propose instead to demand
statistical notions of fairness across exponentially (or infinitely) many
subgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected
attributes. This interpolates between statistical definitions of fairness and
recently proposed individual notions of fairness, but raises several
computational challenges. It is no longer clear how to audit a fixed classifier
to see if it satisfies such a strong definition of fairness. We prove that the
computational problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false
positive rates and statistical parity is equivalent to the problem of weak
agnostic learning, which means it is computationally hard in the worst case,
even for simple structured subclasses.
  We then derive two algorithms that provably converge to the best fair
classifier, given access to oracles which can solve the agnostic learning
problem. The algorithms are based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a
two-player zero-sum game between a Learner and an Auditor. Our first algorithm
provably converges in a polynomial number of steps. Our second algorithm enjoys
only provably asymptotic convergence, but has the merit of simplicity and
faster per-step computation. We implement the simpler algorithm using linear
regression as a heuristic oracle, and show that we can effectively both audit
and learn fair classifiers on real datasets.

superconductivity is still strongly debated. Especially, the pressure-induced
enhancement of superconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ away from the magnetic
breakdown is not sufficiently taken into consideration. As recently reported in
CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ and several related compounds, optimal superconductivity occurs
at the pressure of a valence crossover, which arises from a virtual critical
end point at negative temperature $T_{\rm cr}$. In this context, we did a
meticulous analysis of a vast set of top-quality high-pressure electrical
resistivity data of several Ce-based heavy fermion compounds. The key novelty
is the salient correlation between the superconducting transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ and the valence instability parameter $T_{\rm cr}$, which is in
line with theory of enhanced valence fluctuations. Moreover, it is found that,
in the pressure region of superconductivity, electrical resistivity is governed
by the valence crossover, which most often manifests in scaling behavior. We
develop the new idea that the optimum superconducting $T_{\rm c}$ of a given
sample is mainly controlled by the compound's $T_{\rm cr}$ and limited by
non-magnetic disorder. In this regard, the present study provides compelling
evidence for the crucial role of critical valence fluctuations in the formation
of Cooper pairs in Ce-based heavy fermion superconductors besides the
contribution of spin fluctuations near magnetic quantum critical points, and
corroborates a plausible superconducting mechanism in strongly correlated
electron systems in general.

regularization, quantifying the compression bit-cost of the signal estimate.
While complexity-regularized restoration is an established concept, solid
practical methods were suggested only for the Gaussian denoising task, leaving
more complicated restoration problems without a generally constructive
approach. Here we present practical methods for complexity-regularized
restoration of signals, accommodating degradations caused by a known linear
operator of an arbitrary form. Our iterative procedure, obtained using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach, addresses the
restoration task as a sequence of simpler problems involving L2-regularized
estimations and rate-distortion optimizations (considering the squared-error
criterion). Further, we replace the rate-distortion optimizations with an
arbitrary standardized compression technique and thereby restore the signal by
leveraging underlying models designed for compression. Additionally, we propose
a shift-invariant complexity regularizer, measuring the bit-cost of all the
shifted forms of the estimate, extending our method to use averaging of
decompressed outputs gathered from compression of shifted signals. On the
theoretical side, we present an analysis of complexity-regularized restoration
of a cyclo-stationary Gaussian signal from deterioration by a linear
shift-invariant operator and an additive white Gaussian noise. The theory shows
that optimal complexity-regularized restoration relies on an elementary
restoration filter and compression spreading reconstruction quality unevenly
based on the energy distribution of the degradation filter. Nicely, these ideas
are realized also in the proposed practical methods. The presented experiments
show good results for image deblurring and inpainting using the JPEG2000 and

dimension-incremental approach, which only scales almost linear in the number
of required sampling values and almost quadratic in the arithmetic complexity
with respect to the spatial dimension $d$. Using reconstructing rank-1 lattices
as sampling scheme, the method showed reliable reconstruction results in

developed the concept of multiple rank-1 lattices. In this paper, both concepts

coupled, which yields a distinctly improved high-dimensional sparse fast
Fourier transform. Moreover, the resulting algorithm is analyzed in detail with
respect to success probability, number of required samples, and arithmetic

multiple rank-1 lattices results in a reduction in the complexities by an
almost linear factor with respect to the sparsity. Various numerical tests

that the local box-counting dimension of a discrete quantum spectrum should
depend exclusively on the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) of the
spectrum. In this paper, we validate their hypothesis by deriving an explicit
formula for the local box-counting dimension of a countably-infinite discrete
quantum spectrum. This formula expresses the local box-counting dimension of a
spectrum in terms of single and double integrals of the NNSD of the spectrum.
As applications, we derive an analytical formula for Poisson spectra and
closed-form approximations to the local box-counting dimension for spectra
having Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), and
Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) spacing statistics. In the Poisson and GOE
cases, we compare our theoretical formulas with the published numerical data of
Wang and Ong and observe excellent agreement between their data and our theory.
We also study numerically the local box-counting dimensions of the Riemann zeta
function zeros and the alternate levels of GOE spectra, which are often used as
numerical models of spectra possessing GUE and GSE spacing statistics,
respectively. In each case, the corresponding theoretical formula is found to
accurately describe the numerically-computed local box-counting dimension.

investigate this complex issue. The variational formulation of a liquid-air
Stokes system is established, while the solid substrate is described through
boundary conditions. Expressing the weak form of Laplace's law over liquid-air,
liquid-solid and air-solid interfaces, leads to a natural enforcement of the
mechanical equilibrium over the wetting line, without imposing explicitly the
contact angle itself. The mechanical problem is discretized by using finite
elements, linear both in velocity and pressure, stabilized with a variational
multiscale method, including the possibility of enrichment of the pressure
space. The moving interface is captured by a Level-Set methodology, combined
with a mesh adaptation technique with respect to both pressure and level-set
fields. Our methodology can simulate capillary-driven flows in 2D and 3D with
the desired precision: droplet spreading, droplet coalescence, capillary rise.
In each case, the equilibrium state expected in terms of velocity, pressure and

goals of this paper are to figure out whether the distributions of bi-national

the three ports and uncover the hidden significant influential factors that
result in the possible insufficient utilization. The historical border wait
time data from 7:00 to 21:00 between 08/22/2016 and 06/20/2017 are archived, as
well as the corresponding temporal and weather data. For each vehicle type
towards each direction, a Decision Tree is built to identify the various border
delay patterns over the three bridges. We find that for the passenger vehicles
to the USA, the convenient connections between the Canada freeways with USA
I-190 by LQ and PB may cause these two bridges more congested than RB,
especially when it is a holiday in Canada. For the passenger vehicles in the
other bound, RB is much more congested than LQ and PB in some cases, and the
visitors to Niagara Falls in the USA in summer may be a reason. For the
commercial trucks to the USA, the various delay patterns show PB is always more
congested than LQ. Hour interval and weekend are the most significant factors
appearing in all the four Decision Trees. These Decision Trees can help the
authorities to make specific routing suggestions when the corresponding

systems. Distribution Companies (DisCo) can opt to purchase the electricity
from DG in an energy purchase contract to supply the customer demand and reduce
energy loss. This paper proposes a framework for optimal contract pricing of
independent dispatchable DG units considering competition among them. While DG
units tend to increase their profit from the energy purchase contract, DisCo
minimizes the demand supply cost. Multi-leader follower game theory concept is
used to analyze the situation in which competing DG units offer the energy
price to DisCo and DisCo determines the DG generation. A bi-level approach is
used to formulate the competition in which each DG problem is the upper-level
problem and the DisCo problem is considered as the lower-level one. Combining
the optimality conditions ofall upper-level problems with the lower level
problem results in a multi-DG equilibrium problem formulated as an equilibrium
problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). Using a nonlinear approach, the
EPEC problem is reformulated as a single nonlinear optimization model which is
simultaneously solved for all independent DG units. The proposed framework was
applied to the Modified IEEE 34-Bus Distribution Test System. Performance and
robustness of the proposed framework in determining econo-technically fare DG
contract price has been demonstrated through a series of analyses.

improve the free energy formulation used in Protofold by including the
