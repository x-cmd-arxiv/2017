  Flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multidimensional numerical simulations of a homogeneous, chemically reactive
gas were used to study ignition, flame stability, and
deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in a supersonic combustor. The
configuration studied was a rectangular channel with a supersonic inflow of
stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen and a transimissive outflow boundary. The
calculation is initialized with a velocity in the computational domain equal to
that of the inflow, which is held constant for the duration of the calculation.
The compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations were solved by a high-order
numerical algorithm on an adapting mesh. This paper describes two calculations,
one with a Mach 3 inflow and one with Mach 5.25. In the Mach 3 case, the
fuel-oxidizer mixture does not ignite and the flow reaches a steady-state
oblique shock train structure. In the Mach 5.25 case, ignition occurs in the
boundary layers and the flame front becomes unstable due to a Rayleigh-Taylor
instability at the interface between the burned and unburned gas. Growth of the
reaction front and expansion of the burned gas compress and preheat the
unburned gas. DDT occurs in several locations, initiating both at the flame
front and in the unburned gas, due to an energy-focusing mechanism. The growth
of the flame instability that leads to DDT is analyzed using the Atwood number
parameter.

isogeometric analysis to represent complex domains. We deal with a particular
class of $C^0$ planar multi-patch spline parametrizations called
analysis-suitable $G^1$ (AS-$G^{1}$) multi-patch parametrizations (Collin,
Sangalli, Takacs; CAGD, 2016). This class of parametrizations has to satisfy
specific geometric continuity constraints, and is of importance since it allows
to construct, on the multi-patch domain, $C^1$ isogeometric spaces with optimal
approximation properties. It was demonstrated in (Kapl, Sangalli, Takacs; CAD,
2018) that AS-$G^1$ multi-patch parametrizations are suitable for modeling
complex planar multi-patch domains.
  In this work, we construct a basis, and an associated dual basis, for a
specific $C^1$ isogeometric spline space $\mathcal{W}$ over a given AS-$G^1$
multi-patch parametrization. We call the space $\mathcal{W}$ the Argyris
isogeometric space, since it is $C^1$ across interfaces and $C^2$ at all
vertices and generalizes the idea of Argyris finite elements to tensor-product
splines. The considered space $\mathcal{W}$ is a subspace of the entire $C^1$
isogeometric space $\mathcal{V}^{1}$, which maintains the reproduction
properties of traces and normal derivatives along the interfaces. Moreover, it
reproduces all derivatives up to second order at the vertices. In contrast to
$\mathcal{V}^{1}$, the dimension of $\mathcal{W}$ does not depend on the domain
parametrization, and $\mathcal{W}$ admits a basis and dual basis which possess
a simple explicit representation and local support.
  We conclude the paper with some numerical experiments, which exhibit the
optimal approximation order of the Argyris isogeometric space $\mathcal{W}$ and
demonstrate the applicability of our approach for isogeometric analysis.

  In the first part of this paper, we prove new curvature pinching estimates

in dimension $n \geq 12$, we show that blow-up limits are weakly PIC2. This can
be viewed as a higher-dimensional version of the fundamental Hamilton-Ivey
pinching estimate in dimension $3$.
  In the second part, we develop a theory of ancient solutions which have
bounded curvature; are $\kappa$-noncollapsed; are weakly PIC2; and are
uniformly PIC. This is an extension of Perelman's work; the additional
ingredients needed in the higher dimensional setting are the differential
Harnack inequality for solutions to the Ricci flow satisfying the PIC2
condition, and a rigidity result due to Brendle-Huisken-Sinestrari for ancient
solutions that are uniformly PIC1.
  In the third part of this paper, we prove a Canonical Neighborhood Theorem
for the Ricci flow with initial data with positive isotropic curvature, which
holds in dimension $n \geq 12$. This relies on the curvature pinching estimates
together with the structure theory for ancient solutions. This allows us to
adapt Perelman's surgery procedure to this situation. As a corollary, we obtain
a topological classification of all compact manifolds with positive isotropic

The galaxy clusters are the same in both data set and the non-isothermal
spherical double $\beta$-model was used to describe their electron density and

cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we suppose a possible time evolution
for $\gamma(z)$, such as, $\gamma(z) = \gamma_0(1 + \gamma_1z)$. As main
conclusions we found that: the $\gamma_0$ value is in full agreement with the

show a non-negligible time evolution for the depletion factor, unlike the
results of the simulations. However, we also put constraints on $\gamma (z)$ by
using the $f_{gas}$ measurements and angular diameter distances obtained from
the flat $\Lambda$CDM model (Planck results) and from a sample of galaxy
clusters described by a elliptical profile. For these cases no significant time
evolution for $\gamma(z)$ was found. Then, if a constant depletion factor is an

toward the proto-star IRAS16293$-$2422 and the L1544 pre-stellar core. Our
results show that some key reactions involving the CHNO and C$_2$H$_3$NO
isomers need to be modified to match the observations. Consistently with recent
laboratory findings, hydrogenation is unlikely to produce NH$_2$CHO on grain
surfaces, while a combination of radical-radical surface reactions and
gas-phase reactions is a better alternative. In addition, better results are
obtained for NH$_2$CHO when a slightly higher activation energy of 25$\,$K is

two prominent rings at $r = 75\,$au and $r = 130\,$au intervaled by two gaps at
at $r = 62\,$au and $r = 103\,$au. The two gaps have different widths and
depths, with the inner one being narrower and shallower. We determined the
surface density of the millimeter dust grains using the 3D radiative transfer
disk code \textsc{dali}. According to our fiducial model the inner gap is
partially filled with millimeter grains while the outer gap is largely devoid
of dust. The inferred surface density is compared to 3D hydrodynamical
simulations (FARGO-3D) of planet-disk interaction. The outer dust gap is
consistent with the presence of a giant planet ($M_{\rm planet} \sim
0.8\,M_{\rm Staturn}$); the planet is responsible for the gap opening and for
the pile-up of dust at the outer edge of the planet orbit. The simulations also
show that the same planet can give origin to the inner gap at $r = 62\,$au. The
relative position of the two dust gaps is close to the 2:1 resonance and we
have investigated the possibility of a second planet inside the inner gap. The
resulting surface density (including location, width and depth of the two dust
gaps) are in agreement with the observations. The properties of the inner gap
pose a strong constraint to the mass of the inner planet ($M_{\rm planet} <
0.1\,M_{\rm J}$). In both scenarios (single or pair of planets), the
hydrodynamical simulations suggest a very low disk viscosity ($\alpha <
10^{-4}$). Given the young age of the system (0.5 - 1 Myr), this result implies
that the formation of giant planets occurs on a timescale of $\lesssim$ 1\,Myr.

length scale parameter in such models, we focus on the $|\log\varepsilon|$
energy regime. It is well known that, for configurations whose energy is
bounded by $c|\log\varepsilon|$, the vorticity measures can be decoupled into
the sum of a finite number of Dirac masses, each one of them carrying
$\pi|\log\varepsilon|$ energy, plus a measure supported on small zero-average
sets. Loosely speaking, on such sets the vorticity measure is close, with
respect to the flat norm, to zero-average clusters of positive and negative
masses.

also for the presence of such clusters of dipoles (on the range scale
$\varepsilon^s$, for $0<s<1$), which vanish in the flat convergence and whose
energy contribution has, so far, been neglected. Our results refine and contain
as a particular case the classical $\Gamma$-convergence analysis for vortices,
extending it also to low energy configurations consisting of just clusters of

minimal case with real scalar field, the counterterms are evaluated in a
nonperturbative form in the CPT-even parameter through a redefinition of
space-time metric. In the most complicated case of complex scalar field
nonminimally interacting with gravity, the solution for the divergences is
obtained in the first order in the weak Lorentz violating parameter. The
necessary form of the vacuum counterterms indicate the most important

allow the violating fields to transform, the classical conformal invariance of
massless scalar fields can be maintained in the $\,\xi = 1/6\,$ case. At
quantum level the conformal symmetry is violated by trace anomaly. As a result,
conformal anomaly and the anomaly-induced effective action are evaluated in the

real valued functions over some domain X and an i.i.d. sample drawn from an
unknown distribution P over X, find h in F such that the expectation of h
w.r.t. P is probably approximately equal to the supremum over expectations on
members of F. This Expectation Maximization (EMX) problem captures many well
studied learning problems; in fact, it is equivalent to Vapnik's general
setting of learning.
  Surprisingly, we show that the EMX learnability, as well as the learning
rates of some basic class F, depend on the cardinality of the continuum and is
therefore independent of the set theory ZFC axioms (that are widely accepted as
a formalization of the notion of a mathematical proof).
  We focus on the case where the functions in F are Boolean, which generalizes
classification problems. We study the interaction between the statistical
sample complexity of F and its combinatorial structure. We introduce a new
version of sample compression schemes and show that it characterizes EMX
learnability for a wide family of classes. However, we show that for the class
of finite subsets of the real line, the existence of such compression schemes
is independent of set theory. We conclude that the learnability of that class
with respect to the family of probability distributions of countable support is
independent of the set theory ZFC axioms.
  We also explore the existence of a ""VC-dimension-like"" parameter that
captures learnability in this setting. Our results imply that that there exist
no ""finitary"" combinatorial parameter that characterizes EMX learnability in a
way similar to the VC-dimension based characterization of binary valued
classification problems.

Radiative transfer models (RTMs) represent mathematically the physical laws
which govern the phenomena in remote sensing applications (forward models). The
numerical inversion of the RTM equations is a challenging and computationally
demanding problem, and for this reason, often the application of a nonlinear
statistical regression is preferred. In general, regression models predict the
biophysical parameter of interest from the corresponding received radiance.
However, this approach does not employ the physical information encoded in the
RTMs. An alternative strategy, which attempts to include the physical
knowledge, consists in learning a regression model trained using data simulated
by an RTM code. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear nonparametric regression
model which combines the benefits of the two aforementioned approaches. The
inversion is performed taking into account jointly both real observations and
RTM-simulated data. The proposed Joint Gaussian Process (JGP) provides a solid
framework for exploiting the regularities between the two types of data. The
JGP automatically detects the relative quality of the simulated and real data,
and combines them accordingly. This occurs by learning an additional
hyper-parameter w.r.t. a standard GP model, and fitting parameters through
maximizing the pseudo-likelihood of the real observations. The resulting scheme
is both simple and robust, i.e., capable of adapting to different scenarios.
The advantages of the JGP method compared to benchmark strategies are shown
considering RTM-simulated and real observations in different experiments.
Specifically, we consider leaf area index (LAI) retrieval from Landsat data
combined with simulated data generated by the PROSAIL model.

impact on their evolution. We investigate the link between dark matter haloes
and their constituent galaxies by measuring the angular two-point correlation
function of radio sources, using recently released 3 GHz imaging over $\sim 2 \
\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. We split the radio source population into
Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and further
separate the AGN into radiatively efficient and inefficient accreters.
Restricting our analysis to $z<1$, we find SFGs have a bias, $b = 1.5
^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, at a median redshift of $z=0.62$. On the other hand, AGN are
significantly more strongly clustered with $b = 2.1\pm 0.2$ at a median
redshift of 0.7. This supports the idea that AGN are hosted by more massive
haloes than SFGs. We also find low-accretion rate AGN are more clustered ($b =
2.9 \pm 0.3$) than high-accretion rate AGN ($b = 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$) at the
same redshift ($z \sim 0.7$), suggesting that low-accretion rate AGN reside in
higher mass haloes. This supports previous evidence that the relatively hot gas
that inhabits the most massive haloes is unable to be easily accreted by the
central AGN, causing them to be inefficient. We also find evidence that
low-accretion rate AGN appear to reside in halo masses of $M_{h} \sim 3-4
\times 10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ at all redshifts. On the other hand, the
efficient accreters reside in haloes of $M_{h} \sim 1-2 \times
10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ at low redshift but can reside in relatively lower
mass haloes at higher redshifts. This could be due to the increased prevalence
of cold gas in lower mass haloes at $z \ge 1$ compared to $z<1$.

PSF derived in the Si6 filter, where the thermal continuum dominates. We
performed radiative transfer modelling of the spectral energy distribution and
produced synthetic images in the three filters to investigate different spatial
scenarios. Our data show that the disk emission is spatially resolved in the
PAHs filters, while unresolved in the Si6 filter. An average FHWM of 0.232"",
0.280"" and 0.293"" is measured in the three filters. Gaussian disk fitting and
quadratic subtraction of the science and calibrator suggest a lower-limit
characteristic angular diameter of the emission of circa 100 mas (circa 40 au).
The photometric and spectroscopic results are compatible with previous
findings. Our radiative transfer (RT) modelling of the continuum suggests that
the resolved emission results from PAH molecules on the disk atmosphere being
UV-excited by the central star. Geometrical models of the PAH component
compared to the underlying continuum point at a PAH emission uniformly extended
out to the physical limits of the disk's model. Also, our RT best model of the
continuum requires a negative exponent of the surface density power-law, in
contrast to earlier modelling pointing at a positive exponent. Based on spatial
and spectroscopic considerations as well as on qualitative comparison with
IRS48 and HD97048, we favor a scenario in which PAHs extend out to large radii
across the flared disk surface and are at the same time predominantly in an
ionized charge state due to the strong UV radiation field of the 180 L_sun

enhancement in the hadronic spectra at intermediate $p_T$. Using an outdated

so clusters formed at fixed mass are fewer and hence more biased than for a
pure CDM density field. An enhancement of the cluster bias by 7\% matches the
observations, corresponding to a total neutrino mass, $m_{\nu} = 0.119 \pm
0.034$ eV at 67\% confidence level, for the standard relic neutrino density. If
ongoing laboratory experiments favor a normal neutrino mass hierarchy then we
may infer a somewhat larger total mass than the minimum oscillation based
value, $\sum m_{\nu} \simeq 0.056eV$, with 90\% confidence. Much higher
precision can be achieved by applying our method to a larger sample of more
distant clusters with weak lensing derived masses.

  Tractability and Parallel Algorithms",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tree projections provide a unifying framework to deal with most structural
decomposition methods of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Within this
framework, a CSP instance is decomposed into a number of sub-problems, called
views, whose solutions are either already available or can be computed
efficiently. The goal is to arrange portions of these views in a tree-like
structure, called tree projection, which determines an efficiently solvable CSP
instance equivalent to the original one. Deciding whether a tree projection
exists is NP-hard. Solution methods have therefore been proposed in the
literature that do not require a tree projection to be given, and that either
correctly decide whether the given CSP instance is satisfiable, or return that
a tree projection actually does not exist. These approaches had not been
generalized so far on CSP extensions for optimization problems, where the goal
is to compute a solution of maximum value/minimum cost. The paper fills the
gap, by exhibiting a fixed-parameter polynomial-time algorithm that either
disproves the existence of tree projections or computes an optimal solution,
with the parameter being the size of the expression of the objective function
to be optimized over all possible solutions (and not the size of the whole
constraint formula, used in related works). Tractability results are also
established for the problem of returning the best K solutions. Finally,
parallel algorithms for such optimization problems are proposed and analyzed.
Given that the classes of acyclic hypergraphs, hypergraphs of bounded
treewidth, and hypergraphs of bounded generalized hypertree width are all
covered as special cases of the tree projection framework, the results in this
paper directly apply to these classes. These classes are extensively considered
in the CSP setting, as well as in conjunctive database query evaluation and
optimization.

azimuth $\varphi$ is the angle between the lepton scattering plane

determine the maximal values for the $\cos \varphi$ and $\cos 2\varphi$

calculate the contribution of the transverse-momentum dependent gluonic

linear polarization of gluons inside unpolarized proton. Our analysis shows
that the maximum values of the azimuthal distributions depend strongly on the
gluon polarization; they vary from 0 to 1 depending on $h_{1}^{\perp g}$. We
conclude that the azimuthal $\cos \varphi$ and $\cos 2\varphi$ asymmetries in
heavy-quark pair leptoproduction are predicted to be large and very sensitive
to the contribution of linearly polarized gluons. For this reason, future
measurements of the azimuthal distributions in charm and bottom production at

(R-Euler) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (R-MHD). This results in a
far-reaching local, three-dimensional, non-linear, dispersive generalization of
a KdV-type regularization to compressible/incompressible dissipationless
two-fluid plasmas and models derived therefrom (quasi-neutral, Hall and ideal
MHD). It involves the introduction of vortical and magnetic `twirl' terms
$\lambda_l^2 ({\bf w}_l + \frac{q_l}{m_l} {\bf B}) \times (\nabla \times {\bf
w}_l)$ in the ion/electron velocity equations ($l = i,e$) where ${\bf w}_l =
\nabla \times {\bf v}_l$ are vorticities. The cut-off lengths $\lambda_l$ must
be inversely proportional to the square-roots of the number densities
$(\lambda_l^2 n_l = C_l)$ and may be taken as Debye lengths or skin-depths. A
novel feature is that the `flow' current $\sum_l q_l n_l {\bf v}_l$ in Ampere's
law is augmented by a solenoidal `twirl' current $\sum_l \nabla \times \nabla
\times \lambda_l^2 {\bf j}_{{\rm flow},l}$. The resulting equations imply
conserved linear and angular momenta and a positive definite swirl energy
density ${\cal E}^*$ which includes an enstrophic contribution $\sum_l (1/2)
\lambda_l^2 \rho_l {\bf w}_l^2$. It is shown that the equations admit a
Hamiltonian-Poisson bracket formulation. Furthermore, singularities in $\nabla
\times {\bf B}$ are conservatively regularized by adding $(\lambda_B^2/2 \mu_0)
(\nabla \times {\bf B})^2$ to ${\cal E}^*$. Finally, it is proved that among
regularizations that admit a Hamiltonian formulation and preserve the
continuity equations along with the symmetries of the ideal model, the twirl

media, especially in relation to listening durations and replays. Music
recommendation can take these properties into account in order to predict the
behaviours of the users. Their impact is investigated in this paper. A large
database was thus created using logs collected on a streaming platform, notably
collecting the listening times. The proposed study shows that a high proportion
of the listening events implies a skip action, which may indicate that the user
did not appreciate the track listened. Implicit like and dislike can be deduced
from this information of durations and replays and can be taken into account
for music recommendation and for the evaluation of music recommendation
engines. A quantitative study as usually found in the literature confirms that
neighborhood-based systems considering binary data give the best results in
terms of MAP@k. However, a more qualitative evaluation of the recommended
tracks shows that many tracks recommended, usually evaluated in a positive way,
lead to skips or thus are actually not appreciated. We propose the
consideration of implicit like/dislike as recommendation engine inputs.
Evaluations show that neighbourhood-based engines remain the most precise, but
filtering inputs according to durations and/or replays have a significant
positive impact on the objective of the recommendation engine. The
recommendation process can thus be improved by taking account of listening
durations and replays. We also study the possibility of post-filtering a list
of recommended tracks so as to limit the number of tracks that will be
unpleasantly listened (skip and implicit dislike) and to increase the
proportion of tracks appreciated (implicit like). Several simple algorithms
show that this post-filtering operation leads to an improvement of the quality
of the music recommendations.

oscillatory dispersive shock waves. Both the soliton and the barrier satisfy
the same one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation,
which admits a convenient dispersive hydrodynamic interpretation. Under the
scale separation assumption of Whitham modulation theory the highly nontrivial
nonlinear interaction between the soliton and the evolving hydrodynamic barrier
is described in terms of simple wave solutions to an appropriate asymptotic
reduction of the Whitham-NLS system. One of the Riemann invariants of the
reduced modulation system determines the characteristics of a soliton
interacting with an initial mean flow that results in soliton tunneling or
trapping. Another Riemann invariant yields the soliton tunneling phase shift.
Under certain conditions, soliton interaction with hydrodynamic barriers gives
rise to new effects that include reversal of the soliton propagation direction
and spontaneous soliton cavitation, which further suggest possible methods of
dark soliton control in optical fibers.

The surfaces of these systems develop spontaneous magnetizations whose

between the $p$ and $s$-component gap functions. Along the magnetic domain
walls on the surface, there exist chiral Majorana fermions propagating
unidirectionally, which can be conveniently dragged and controlled by external
magnetic fields. Furthermore, the surface magnetization is shown to be a
magnetoelectric effect based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis. We also

Bayesian regularization strategies and a novel hierarchical prior distribution

are designed to work with a large number of codes while controlling variance by
shrinking coefficients towards zero or towards a group-level mean. A comparison

message out of $K$ possible messages from $N$ databases without revealing the
identity of the desired message. Majority of existing works on PIR assume the
presence of replicated databases, each storing all the $K$ messages. In this
work, we consider the problem of PIR from storage constrained databases. Each
database has a storage capacity of $\mu KL$ bits, where $K$ is the number of
messages, $L$ is the size of each message in bits, and $\mu \in [1/N, 1]$ is
the normalized storage. In the storage constrained PIR problem, there are two
key design questions: a) how to store content across each database under
storage constraints; and b) construction of schemes that allow efficient PIR
through storage constrained databases. The main contribution of this work is a
general achievable scheme for PIR from storage constrained databases for any
value of storage. In particular, for any $(N,K)$, with normalized storage $\mu=
t/N$, where the parameter $t$ can take integer values $t \in \{1, 2, \ldots,
N\}$, we show that our proposed PIR scheme achieves a download cost of
$\left(1+ \frac{1}{t}+ \frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\right)$. The
extreme case when $\mu=1$ (i.e., $t=N$) corresponds to the setting of
replicated databases with full storage. For this extremal setting, our scheme
recovers the information-theoretically optimal download cost characterized by
Sun and Jafar as $\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. For
the other extreme, when $\mu= 1/N$ (i.e., $t=1$), the proposed scheme achieves
a download cost of $K$. The interesting aspect of the result is that for
intermediate values of storage, i.e., $1/N < \mu <1$, the proposed scheme can
strictly outperform memory-sharing between extreme values of storage.

leveraging expressive, high-capacity neural network models, our approach allows
for these predictions to be directly conditioned on camera images, endowing the

reproduces the slope and normalization evolution of the MZR across the redshift
range $0<z<2$ and mass range $10^9 < M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot < 10^{10.5}$. We make
predictions for the high redshift ($2<z<10$) metal content of galaxies which is
described by a gradual decline in the normalization of the metallicity with an
average high redshift ($z>2$) evolution fit by $\mathrm{d\;log(Z)}/\mathrm{dz}
\approx - 0.064$. Our simulations indicate that the metal retention efficiency
of the interstellar medium (ISM) is low: a majority of gas-phase metals ($\sim$
85 per cent at $z=0$) live outside of the ISM, either in an extended gas disk,
the circumgalactic medium, or outside the halo. Nevertheless, the redshift
evolution in the simulated MZR normalization is driven by the higher gas
fractions of high redshift galaxies, not by changes to the metal retention
efficiency. The scatter in the simulated MZR contains a clear correlation with
the gas-mass or star formation rate of the system, in agreement with the
observed fundamental metallicity relation. The scatter in the MZR is driven by
a competition between periods of enrichment- and accretion-dominated
metallicity evolution. We expect that while the normalization of the MZR
declines with redshift, the strength of the correlation between metallicity and
gas-mass at fixed stellar mass is not a strong function of redshift. Our
results indicate that the ""regulator"" style models are best suited for
simultaneously explaining the shape, redshift evolution, and existence of
correlated scatter with gas fraction about the MZR.

pathway to seed the formation of supermassive black holes in the early

forms in a hot gas cloud irradiated by a nearby star-forming galaxy. We study
the DC SMS formation in a fully cosmological context using three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We initialize our simulations using the
outputs of the cosmological simulation of Chon et al. (2016), where two DC gas
clouds are identified. The long-term evolution over a hundred thousand years is
followed from the formation of embryo protostars through their growth to SMSs.
We show that the strength of the tidal force by a nearby galaxy determines the
multiplicity of the formed stars and affects the protostellar growth. In one
case, where a collapsing cloud is significantly stretched by strong tidal
force, multiple star-disk systems are formed via filament fragmentation.
Small-scale fragmentation occurs in each circumstellar disk, and more than 10
stars with masses of a few times 10^3 Msun are finally formed. Interestingly,
about a half of them are found as massive binary stars. In the other case, the
gas cloud collapses nearly spherically under a relatively weak tidal field, and
a single star-disk system is formed. Only a few SMSs with masses ~ 10^4 Msun
are found already after evolution of a hundred thousand years, and the SMSs are
expected to grow further by gas accretion and to leave massive blackholes at

relationship between entanglement and emergent spacetime. These investigations
have revealed that entanglement between holographic degrees of freedom is
crucial for the existence of bulk spacetime. We examine this connection from
the other end of the entanglement spectrum and clarify the assertion that
maximally entangled states have no reconstructable spacetime. To do so, we
first define the conditions for bulk reconstructability. Under these terms, we
scrutinize two cases of maximally entangled holographic states. One is the
familiar example of AdS black holes; these are dual to thermal states of the
boundary CFT. Sending the temperature to the cutoff scale makes the state
maximally entangled and the respective black hole consumes the spacetime. We
then examine the de Sitter limit of FRW spacetimes. This limit is maximally
entangled if one formulates the boundary theory on the holographic screen.
Paralleling the AdS black hole, we find the resulting reconstructable region of
spacetime vanishes. Motivated by these results, we prove a theorem showing that
maximally entangled states have no reconstructable spacetime. Evidently, the
emergence of spacetime is endemic to intermediate entanglement. By studying the
manner in which intermediate entanglement is achieved, we uncover important
properties about the boundary theory of FRW spacetimes. With this clarified
understanding, our final discussion elucidates the natural way in which
holographic Hilbert spaces may house states dual to different geometries. This
paper provides a coherent picture clarifying the link between spacetime and
entanglement and develops many promising avenues of further work.

this is in part due to the line of sight structure (LoS) at redshifts beyond 2.
We show that the Grale mass reconstruction based on sources at 3<z_s<4.1 has at
least 10^{13}M_sun more mass than that based on nearby sources, z_s<2.6, and
attribute the excess mass to a putative LoS, which is at least 75"" from the
cluster center. Furthermore, the lens-model fitted z_s's of the recent Kawamata
et al. reconstruction are biased systematically low compared to photometric
z_s's, and the bias is a function of images' distance from the cluster center.
We argue that these mimic the effect of LoS. We conclude that even in the
presence of 100-200 images, lens-model adjusted source redshifts can conceal
the presence of LoS, demonstrating the existence of degeneracies between z_s
and (sub)structure. Also, a very good fit to image positions is not a
sufficient condition for having a high fidelity mass map: Kawamata et al.
obtain an rms of 0.52"" for 173 images of 60 sources; our Grale reconstruction
of the exact same data yields a somewhat different map, but similarly low rms,
0.62"". In contrast, a Grale model that uses reasonable, but fixed z_s gives a
worse rms of 1.28"" for 44 sources with 126 images. Unaccounted for LoS can bias
the mass map, affecting the magnification and luminosity function estimates of
high redshift sources.

that galaxy cluster members have a characteristic composite luminosity

hidden behind dust and gas. The distribution of material around AGNs plays an
important role in modeling the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), especially the
fraction of Type-2 AGNs ($f_2$). One of the possible explanations for the
obscuration in Seyfert galaxies at intermediate redshift is dusty starburst
discs. We compute the 2D hydrostatic structure of 768 nuclear starburst discs
(NSDs) under various physical conditions and also the distribution of column
density along the line of sight ($N_{\text{H}}$) associated with these discs.
Then, the $N_{\text{H}}$ distribution is evolved with redshift by using the
redshift dependent distribution function of input parameters. The $f_2$ shows a
strong positive evolution up to $z=2$, but only a weak level of enhancement at
higher $z$. The Compton-thin and Compton-thick AGN fractions associated with
these starburst regions increase as $\propto (1+z)^{\delta}$ where the $\delta$
is estimated to be 1.12 and 1.45, respectively. The reflection parameter $R_f$
associated with column density $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ extends

obscured by nuclear starbursts, we predict that 40 to 60 per cent of quasars

for a few exoplanets to date. It comes from strong transit signals detected in
the ultraviolet, most notably in the wings of the hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$
(Ly$\alpha$) line. However, the core of the Ly$\alpha$ line is often heavily
affected by interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission, limiting the
information about the atmosphere that can be extracted from that part of the
spectrum. Transit observations in atomic lines that are (a) sensitive enough to
trace the rarefied gas in the planetary wind and (b) do not suffer from
significant extinction by the interstellar medium could enable more detailed
observations, and thus provide better constraints on theoretical models of
escaping atmospheres. The absorption line of a metastable state of helium at
10830 \AA\ could satisfy both of these conditions for some exoplanets. We
develop a simple 1D model of escaping planetary atmospheres containing hydrogen
and helium. We use it to calculate the density profile of helium in the 2$^3$S
metastable excited state and the expected in-transit absorption at 10830 \AA\
for two exoplanets known to have escaping atmospheres. Our results indicate
that exoplanets similar to GJ 436b and HD 209458b should exhibit enhanced
transit depths at 10830 \AA, with $\sim 8\%$ and $\sim 2\%$ excess absorption
in the line core, respectively.

nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters, are promising targets for searches for
gamma-rays from dark matter annihilation. We review the predictions for the
annihilation flux from individual halos, focusing on the effect of current
uncertainties in the concentration-mass relation and the contribution from halo
substructure, and also estimating the intrinsic halo-to-halo scatter expected.
After careful consideration of recent simulation results, we conclude that the
concentrations of the smallest halos, while well determined at high redshift,
are still uncertain by a factor of 4-6 when extrapolated to low redshift. This
in turn produces up to two orders of magnitude uncertainty in the predicted
annihilation flux for any halo mass above this scale. Substructure evolution,
the small-scale cutoff to the power spectrum, cosmology, and baryonic effects
all introduce smaller, though cumulative, uncertainties. We then consider
intrinsic variations from halo to halo. These arise from variations in
concentration and substructure, leading to a scatter of $\sim$ 2.5 in the
predicted annihilation luminosity. Finally, we consider the problem of
detecting gamma-rays from annihilation, given the expected contributions from
other sources. We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for gamma-ray detection as
a function of halo mass, assuming that cosmic rays from star formation are the
main noise source in the detection. This calculation suggests that group-scale
halos, individually or in stacks, may be a particularly interesting target for
the next generation of annihilation searches.

ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) using optical through near-infrared (NIR)
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Our analysis is enabled by new
$Spitzer$-IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m imaging, archival optical imaging, and
the prospector fully Bayesian SED fitting framework. Our sample contains one
field UDG (DGSAT I), one Virgo cluster UDG (VCC 1287), and one Virgo cluster
dwarf elliptical for comparison (VCC 1122). We find that the optical--NIR
colors of the three galaxies are significantly different from each other. We
infer that VCC 1287 has an old ($\gtrsim7.7$ Gyr) and surprisingly metal-poor
($[Z/Z_{\odot}]\lesssim-1.0$) stellar population, even after marginalizing over
uncertainties on diffuse interstellar dust. In contrast, the field UDG DGSAT I
shows evidence of being younger than the Virgo UDG, with an extended star
formation history and an age posterior extending down to $\sim3$ Gyr. The
stellar metallicity of DGSAT I is sub-solar but higher than that of the Virgo
UDG, with $[Z/Z_{\odot}]=-0.63^{+0.35}_{-0.62}$; in the case of exactly zero
diffuse interstellar dust, DGSAT I may even have solar metallicity. With VCC
1287 and several Coma UDGs, a general picture is emerging where cluster UDGs
may be ""failed"" galaxies, but the field UDG DGSAT I seems more consistent with
a stellar feedback-induced expansion scenario. In the future, our approach can
be applied to a large and diverse sample of UDGs down to faint surface
brightness limits, with the goal of constraining their stellar ages, stellar
metallicities, and circumstellar and diffuse interstellar dust content.

systems inside solar coronal active regions following high energy events like
solar flares. In this work, we propose that such collapse can be modeled in
three dimensions quite accurately within the framework of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics. We furthermore argue that the dynamics of loop implosion
is only sensitive to the transmitted disturbance of one or more of the system
variables, e.g. velocity generated at the event site. This indicates that to
understand loop implosion, it is sensible to leave the event site out of the
simulated active region. Towards our goal, a velocity pulse is introduced to
model the transmitted disturbance generated at the event site. Magnetic field
lines inside our simulated active region are traced in real time, and it is
demonstrated that the subsequent dynamics of the simulated loops closely
resemble observed imploding loops. Our work highlights the role of plasma
$\beta$ in regards to the rigidity of the loop systems and how that might
affect the imploding loops' dynamics. Compressible magnetohydrodynamic modes
such as kink and sausage are also shown to be generated during such processes,
in accordance with observations.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx2956",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of
paramount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational
lensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modeling, and constraining the
nature of dark matter. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM
substructure is typically modeled using N-body simulations, which reveal that
large fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper we
use both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to
investigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating
and stripping, or numerical (i.e., artificial). We show that, contrary to naive
expectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock $\Delta E$ that exceeds
the subhalo's binding energy, $|E_{\rm b}|$, do not undergo disruption, even
when $\Delta E/|E_{\rm b}|$ is as large as 100. Along the same line, and
contrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter
from the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete
disruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In
addition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters
with other subhaloes (`harassment'), is negligible compared to the tidal
effects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of
baryonic processes, the complete, physical disruption of CDM substructure is
extremely rare, and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore
must be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with
numerical overmerging, and conclude that inadequate force-softening is the most
likely culprit.

intellectual property (IP) from reverse engineers. Most prior art, however,
cannot leverage the full potential of LC due to excessive overheads and/or
their limited scope on an FEOL-centric and accordingly customized manufacturing
process. If at all, most existing techniques can be reasonably applied only to
selected parts of a chip---we argue that such ""small-scale or custom
camouflaging"" will eventually be circumvented, irrespective of the underlying
technique. In this work, we propose a novel LC scheme which is low-cost and
generic---full-chip LC can finally be realized without any reservation. Our
scheme is based on obfuscating the interconnects (BEOL); it can be readily
applied to any design without modifications in the device layer (FEOL). Applied
with split manufacturing in conjunction, our approach is the first in the
literature to cope with both the FEOL fab and the end-user being untrustworthy.
We implement and evaluate our primitives at the (DRC-clean) layout level; our
scheme incurs significantly lower cost than most of the previous works. When
comparing fully camouflaged to original layouts (i.e., for 100% LC), we observe
on average power, performance, and area overheads of 12%, 30%, and 48%,
respectively. Here we also show empirically that most existing LC techniques
(as well as ours) can only provide proper resilience against powerful SAT
attacks once at least 50% of the layout is camouflaged---only large-scale LC is
practically secure. As indicated, our approach can deliver even 100% LC at
acceptable cost. Finally, we also make our flow publicly available, enabling

under suitable assumptions on the associated batch-size of samples utilized at
each iteration, the SI-ADMM scheme produces a sequence that converges to the
unique solution almost surely; (ii) If the number of gradient steps (or
equivalently, the number of sampled gradients) utilized for solving the
subproblems in each iteration increases at a geometric rate, the mean-squared
error diminishes to zero at a prescribed geometric rate; (iii) The overall
iteration complexity in terms of gradient steps (or equivalently samples) is
found to be consistent with the canonical level of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$.
Preliminary applications on LASSO and distributed regression suggest that the

inflict extensive damage to banks themselves and to the external economy. The
crisis literature has so far identified a number of distinct effects or
channels that can propagate distress contagiously both directly within the
banking network itself and indirectly, between the network and the external
economy. These contagious effects, and the potential events that trigger these
effects, can explain most aspects of past crises, and are thought to be likely
to dominate future financial crises. Since the current international financial
regulatory regime based on the Basel III Accord does a good job of ensuring
that banks are resilient to such contagion effects taken one at a time,
systemic risk theorists increasingly understand that future crises are likely
to be dominated by the spillovers between distinct contagion channels. The
present paper aims to provide a model for systemic risk that is comprehensive
enough to include the important contagion channels identified in the
literature. In such a model one can hope to understand the dangerous spillover
effects that are expected to dominate future crises. To rein in the number and
complexity of the modelling assumptions, two requirements are imposed, neither
of which is yet well-known or established in the main stream of systemic risk
research. The first, called stock-flow consistency, demands that the financial
system follows a rigorous set of rules based on accounting principles. The
second requirement, called Asset-Liability symmetry, implies that every
proposed contagion channel has a dual channel obtained by interchanging assets
and liabilities, and that these dual channel pairs have a symmetric
mathematical representation.

opposite regimes of canonical single field inflation: attractor (standard
single field slow-roll inflation) and non attractor (ultra slow-roll
inflation). In the attractor regime, the standard derivation of the
bispectrum's squeezed limit using co-moving coordinates gives the well known
Maldacena's consistency relation $f_{NL} = 5(1-n_{s})/12$. On the other hand,
in the non-attractor regime, the squeezed limit offers a substantial violation
of this relation given by $f_{NL} = 5/2$. In this work we argue that,
independently of whether inflation is attractor or non-attractor, the size of
the observable primordial local non-Gaussianity is predicted to be
$f_{NL}^{obs} = 0$ (a result that was already understood to hold in the case of
attractor models). To show this, we follow the use of the so-called Conformal
Fermi Coordinates (CFC), recently introduced in the literature. These
coordinates parametrize the local environment of inertial observers in a
perturbed FRW spacetime, allowing one to identify and compute gauge invariant
quantities, such as $n$-point correlation functions. Concretely, we find that
during inflation, after all the modes have exited the horizon, the squeezed
limit of the 3-point correlation function of curvature perturbations vanishes
in the CFC frame, regardless of the inflationary regime. We argue that such a
cancellation should persist after inflation ends.

introduced by Montanaro (arXiv:1509.02374). These algorithms explore trees of
unknown structure, and in certain cases exponentially outperform classical
procedures (such as DPLL). Some of the previous work focused on obtaining a
quantum advantage for trees in which a unique marked vertex is promised to
exist. We remove this restriction and re-characterise the problem in terms of
the effective resistance of the search space. To this end, we present a
generalisation of one of Montanaro's algorithms to trees containing $k \geq 1$
marked vertices, where $k$ is not necessarily known \textit{a priori}.
  Our approach involves using amplitude estimation to determine a near-optimal
weighting of a diffusion operator, which can then be applied to prepare a
superposition state that has support only on marked vertices and ancestors
thereof. By repeatedly sampling this state and updating the input vertex, a
marked vertex is reached in a logarithmic number of steps. The algorithm
thereby achieves the conjectured bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{TR_{\mathrm{max}}})$ for finding a single marked
vertex and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(k\sqrt{T R_{\mathrm{max}}}\right)$ for
finding all $k$ marked vertices, where $T$ is an upper bound on the tree size
and $R_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum effective resistance encountered by the
algorithm. This constitutes a speedup over Montanaro's original procedure in
both the case of finding one and finding multiple marked vertices in an
arbitrary tree. If there are no marked vertices, the effective resistance
becomes infinite, and we recover the scaling of Montanaro's existence
algorithm.

there have been several prior whole-system provenance systems that captured a
comprehensive, systemic and ubiquitous record of a system's behavior, none have
been widely adopted. They either A) impose too much overhead, B) are designed
for long-outdated kernel releases and are hard to port to current systems, C)
generate too much data, or D) are designed for a single system. CamFlow
addresses these shortcoming by: 1) leveraging the latest kernel design advances
to achieve efficiency; 2) using a self-contained, easily maintainable
implementation relying on a Linux Security Module, NetFilter, and other
existing kernel facilities; 3) providing a mechanism to tailor the captured
provenance data to the needs of the application; and 4) making it easy to
integrate provenance across distributed systems. The provenance we capture is
streamed and consumed by tenant-built auditor applications. We illustrate the
usability of our implementation by describing three such applications:
demonstrating compliance with data regulations; performing fault/intrusion
detection; and implementing data loss prevention. We also show how CamFlow can

the presence AGN feedback energy, the higher-mass (>~ 5 x 10^11 M_Sun) ACT

defining and identifying communities in networks can be interpreted as a
classical communication task over a noisy channel: memberships of nodes are
information bits erased by the channel, edges and non-edges in the network are
parity bits introduced by the encoder but degraded through the channel, and a
community identification algorithm is a decoder. The interpretation is
perfectly equivalent to the one at the basis of well-known statistical
inference algorithms for community detection. The only difference in the
interpretation is that a noisy channel replaces a stochastic network model.
However, the different perspective gives the opportunity to take advantage of
the rich set of tools of coding theory to generate novel insights on the
problem of community detection. In this paper, we illustrate two main
applications of standard coding-theoretical methods to community detection.
First, we leverage a state-of-the-art decoding technique to generate a family
of quasi-optimal community detection algorithms. Second and more important, we
show that the Shannon's noisy-channel coding theorem can be invoked to
establish a lower bound, here named as decodability bound, for the maximum
amount of noise tolerable by an ideal decoder to achieve perfect detection of
communities. When computed for well-established synthetic benchmarks, the
decodability bound explains accurately the performance achieved by the best
community detection algorithms existing on the market, telling us that only
little room for their improvement is still potentially left.

growth, what is the nature of MW diameter stochasticity, and what is the origin
of the well-known striation structure of MW side surfaces. In an attempt to
address such questions we performed an in-depth study of MW structure at the
nanoscale by detaching a MW from its original film, reducing its size to a thin
slice by cutting its sides by a focused ion beam, and performing TEM on that
structure. Our observations revealed a rich nontrivial morphology suggesting
that MW may consist of many side by side grown filaments. This structure
appears to extend to the outside whisker surface and be the reason for the
striation. In addition, we put forward a theory where nucleation of multiple
thin metal needles results into micron-scale and larger MW diameters. This
theory is developed in the average field approximation similar to the

The present study identifies a fundamental performance limitation of

transient energy growth in response to optimal disturbances, control by
observer-based feedback will necessarily lead to transient energy growth in
response to optimal disturbances for the closed-loop system as well. Indeed,
this result establishes that observer-based feedback can be a poor candidate
for controller synthesis in the context of transient energy growth suppression
and transition delay: the performance objective of transient energy growth
suppression can never be achieved by means of observer-based feedback. Further,
an illustrative example is used to show that alternative forms of output
feedback are not necessarily subject to these same performance limitations, and

signature of outflowing molecular gas. Due to the high optical depths at far-IR
wavelengths, the interpretation of the outflow signature is uncertain. At mm
and radio wavelengths, the radiation is better able to penetrate the large
columns of gas and dust. We used high resolution observations from the SMA,
ALMA, and the VLA to image the CO 2-1 and 6-5 emission, the 690 GHz continuum,
the radio cm continuum, and absorptions by rotationally excited OH. The CO line
profiles exhibit wings extending 300 km/s beyond the systemic velocity. At cm
wavelengths, we find a compact (40 pc) continuum component in the nucleus, with
weaker emission extending several 100 pc approximately along the major and
minor axes of the galaxy. In the OH absorption lines toward the compact
continuum, wings extending to a similar velocity as for the CO are seen on the
blue side of the profile. The weak cm continuum emission along the minor axis
is aligned with a highly collimated, jet-like dust feature previously seen in
near-IR images of the galaxy. Comparison of the apparent optical depths in the
OH lines indicate that the excitation conditions in Zw 049.057 differ from
those in other OH megamaser galaxies. We interpret the wings in the spectral
lines as signatures of a molecular outflow. A relation between this outflow and
the minor axis radio feature is possible, although further studies are required
to investigate this possible association and understand the connection between
the outflow and the nuclear activity. Finally, we suggest that the differing OH
excitation conditions are further evidence that Zw 049.057 is in a transition

density is reduced, the high mobility bands are depopulated, and weak

cross validation strategy is the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) where
one sample is left out for validation and training is done on the rest of the

hour-like time scale (intra-night optical variability, or INOV) of several
major types of high-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Such information
was previously available only for blazars. Similar studies have since been
initiated in at least a dozen countries, giving a boost to AGN variability
research.
  Our work has, in particular, provided strong indication that mild INOV occurs
in radio-quiet QSOs (amplitude up to $\sim 3-5\%$ and duty cycle $\sim 10\%$)
and, moreover, has demonstrated that similarly mild INOV is exhibited even by
the vast majority of radio-loud quasars which possess powerful relativistic
jets (even including many that are beamed towards us). The solitary outliers
are blazars, the tiny strongly polarized subset of powerful AGN, which
frequently exhibit a pronounced INOV. Among the blazars, BL Lac objects often
show a bluer-when-brighter chromatic behavior, while the flat spectrum radio
quasars seem not to. Quantifying any differences of INOV among the major
subclasses of non-blazar type AGNs will require dedicated monitoring programs

of its silicate reservoirs (crust and mantle). Depending on the frequency, size
and velocity of such impactors, effects included regional and global scale
crustal melting, and thermal perturbations of the mercurian mantle. We use a 3D
transient heating model to test the effects of two bombardment scenarios on
early (pre Tolstojan) Mercury mantle and crust. Results show that rare impacts
by the largest (greater than 100 km diameter) bodies deliver sufficient heat to
the shallow mercurian mantle producing high-temperature ultra-magnesian
(komatiitic s.s.) melts. Impact heating leading to effusive (flood) volcanism
can account for eponymous High-Magnesium Region (HMR) observed during the

We find that late accretion to Mercury induced volumetrically significant

explains why its oldest cratering record was effectively erased, consistent

minimized so that electron tracks can be cleanly matched to calorimeter

reconstruction for particle identification. Consequently, the material budget
for the forward tracking detectors is critical. The construction of the
detector builds on the mechanical foil stretching and assembly technique
pioneered by CMS for the muon endcap GEM upgrade. As an innovation, this
detector implements drift and readout electrodes on thin large foils instead of
on PCBs. These foils get stretched mechanically together with three GEM foils
in a single stack. This reduces the radiation length of the total detector
material in the active area by a factor seven from over 4% to below 0.6%. It
also aims at improving the uniformity of drift and induction gap sizes across
the detector and consequently signal response uniformity. Thin outer frames
custom-made from carbon-fiber composite material take up the tension from the
stretched foil stack and provide detector rigidity while keeping the detector
mass low. The gas volume is closed with thin aluminized polyimide foils. The
trapezoidal detector covers an azimuthal angle of 30.1 degrees and a radius
from 8 cm to 90 cm. It is read out with radial zigzag strips with pitches of
1.37 mrad at the outer radius and 4.14 mrad at the inner radius that reduce the

from $\tau$ Boo b, a hot Jupiter with one of the brightest host stars. Since
its discovery in 1997, it has been the subject of several reflected-light

in to a single meta-analysis. We analysed more than 2,000 archival
high-dispersion spectra obtained with the UVES, ESPaDOnS, NARVAL UES and
HARPS-N spectrographs during various epochs between 1998 and 2013. Each
spectrum was first cleaned of the stellar spectrum and subsequently
cross-correlated with a PHOENIX model spectrum. These were then Doppler shifted
to the planet rest-frame and co-added in time, weighted according to the
expected signal-to-noise of the planet signal. We reach a 3$\sigma$ upper limit
of the planet to star contrast of $1.5 \times 10^{-5}$. Assuming a planet
radius of 1.15 $R_J$, this corresponds to an optical albedo of 0.12 between
400-700 nm. This low albedo is in line with secondary eclipse and phase curve
observations of other hot Jupiters using space-based observatories, as well as
theoretical predictions of their reflective properties.

cost-effectiveness by planning ahead and pre-allocating resources towards

categories for maintenance activities: Corrective: fault fixing; Perfective:
system improvements; Adaptive: new feature introduction. Previous work in this
area has mostly concentrated on evaluating commit classification (into
maintenance activities) models in the scope of a single software project. Aims:
In this work we seek to design a commit classification model capable of
providing high accuracy and Kappa across different projects. In addition, we
wish to compare the accuracy and kappa characteristics of classification models
that utilize word frequency analysis, source code changes, and combination
thereof. Method: We suggest a novel method for automatically classifying
commits into maintenance activities by utilizing source code changes (e.g,
statement added, method removed, etc.). The results we report are based on
studying 11 popular open source projects from various professional domains from
which we had manually classified 1151 commits, over 100 from each of the
studied projects. Our models were trained using 85% of the dataset, while the
remaining 15% were used as a test set. Results: Our method shows a promising
accuracy of 76% and Cohen's kappa of 63% (considered ""Good"" in this context)
for the test dataset, an improvement of over 20 percentage points, and a
relative boost of ~40% in the context of cross-project classification.
Conclusions: We show that by using source code changes in combination with
commit message word frequency analysis we are able to considerably boost
classification quality in a project agnostic manner.

Fermi energy is in the spectral gap close to the energy of Dirac point. The
scaling relation between local and non-local resistances is investigated as the

proposed concept is based on a mathematical model, which indicates that in
teach-and-repeat navigation scenarios, mobile robots do not need to perform
explicit localisation. Rather than that, a mobile robot which repeats a
previously taught path can simply `replay' the learned velocities, while using
its camera information only to correct its heading relative to the intended
path. To support our claim, we establish a position error model of a robot,
which traverses a taught path by only correcting its heading. Then, we outline
a mathematical proof which shows that this position error does not diverge over
time. Based on the insights from the model, we present a simple monocular
teach-and-repeat navigation method. The method is computationally efficient, it
does not require camera calibration, and it can learn and autonomously traverse
arbitrarily-shaped paths. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the
method can reliably guide mobile robots in realistic indoor and outdoor
conditions, and can cope with imperfect odometry, landmark deficiency,
illumination variations and naturally-occurring environment changes.

include the treatment of secondary woody vegetation, which benefits from a
tight coupling between the land-use module and the Population Orders Physiology

implemented a novel approach to constrain modelled GPP consistent with the
Co-ordination Hypothesis, predicted by evolutionary theory, which suggests that
electron transport and Rubisco-limited rates adjust seasonally and across
biomes to be co-limiting. We show that the default prior assumption - common to
CABLE and other LSMs - of a fixed ratio of electron transport to carboxylation

algorithm for dynamic optimisation of this ratio, such that co-ordination is
achieved as an outcome of fitness maximisation. Results have significant

rate-compatible punctured polar (RCPP) code. One of the major challenges on the
construction of a RCPP code is to design a common information set which is good
for all the codes in the family. In the proposed construction, a common
information set is simply optimized for the highest-rate punctured polar code
in the family and then, this set is updated for each other code by satisfying
the condition that information bits are unchanged during retransmissions. This
is enabled by presenting a novel hierarchical puncturing and information-copy
technique. To be specific, some information bits are copied to frozen-bit
channels, which yields an information-dependent frozen vector. Then, the
updated information sets are obtained by appropriately combining the common
information set and an information-dependent frozen vector. Moreover, the
impact of unknown frozen bits are resolved using the proposed hierarchical
puncturing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RCPP code attains
a significant performance gain (about 2dB) over a benchmark RCPP code where
both codes use the same puncturing patterns but the latter uses the
conventional all-zero frozen vector. Therefore, the proposed method would be
crucial to construct a good RCPP code.

major issue in the domain of supervised learning. Most supervised learning
algorithms assume equal cardinality of the classes under consideration while
optimizing the cost function and this assumption does not hold true for
imbalanced datasets which results in sub-optimal classification. Therefore,
various approaches, such as undersampling, oversampling, cost-sensitive
learning and ensemble based methods have been proposed for dealing with
imbalanced datasets. However, undersampling suffers from information loss,
oversampling suffers from increased runtime and potential overfitting while
cost-sensitive methods suffer due to inadequately defined cost assignment
schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel boosting based method called
LIUBoost. LIUBoost uses under sampling for balancing the datasets in every
boosting iteration like RUSBoost while incorporating a cost term for every
instance based on their hardness into the weight update formula minimizing the
information loss introduced by undersampling. LIUBoost has been extensively
evaluated on 18 imbalanced datasets and the results indicate significant

Current-induced SOT switching of the perpendicular magnetization is of
particular technological importance. The SOT consists of damping-like and
field-like torques so that the efficient SOT switching requires to understand
combined effects of the two torque-components. Previous quasi-static
measurements have reported an increased switching probability with the width of
current pulses, as predicted with considering the damping-like torque only.
Here we report a decreased switching probability at longer pulse-widths, based
on time-resolved measurements. Micromagnetic analysis reveals that this
anomalous SOT switching results from domain wall reflections at sample edges.
The domain wall reflection is found to strongly depend on the field-like torque
and its relative sign to the damping-like torque. Our result demonstrates a key
role of the field-like torque in the deterministic SOT switching and notifies

  Surface","21 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local feature description is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D
computer vision. This paper proposes a novel descriptor, named Statistic of
Deviation Angles on Subdivided Space (SDASS), of encoding geometrical and
spatial information of local surface on Local Reference Axis (LRA). In terms of
encoding geometrical information, considering that surface normals, which are
usually used for encoding geometrical information of local surface, are
vulnerable to various nuisances (e.g., noise, varying mesh resolutions etc.),
we propose a robust geometrical attribute, called Local Minimum Axis (LMA), to
replace the normals for generating the geometrical feature in our SDASS
descriptor. For encoding spatial information, we use two spatial features for
fully encoding the spatial information of a local surface based on LRA which
usually presents high overall repeatability than Local Reference Axis (LRF).
Besides, an improved LRA is proposed for increasing the robustness of our SDASS
to noise and varying mesh resolutions. The performance of the SDASS descriptor
is rigorously tested on four popular datasets. The results show that our
descriptor has a high descriptiveness and strong robustness, and its
performance outperform existing algorithms by a large margin. Finally, the
proposed descriptor is applied to 3D registration. The accurate result further
confirms the effectiveness of our SDASS method.

recently emerged as an efficient means to electrically control the magnetic
state of ultrathin magnets. The SOT switching still lacks in oscillatory
switching characteristics over time, therefore, it is limited to bipolar
operation where a change in polarity of the applied current or field is
required for bistable switching. The coherent rotation based oscillatory
switching schemes cannot be applied to SOT because the SOT switching occurs
through expansion of magnetic domains. Here, we experimentally achieve
oscillatory switching in incoherent SOT process by controlling domain wall
dynamics. We find that a large field-like component can dynamically influence
the domain wall chirality which determines the direction of SOT switching.
Consequently, under nanosecond current pulses, the magnetization switches
alternatively between the two stable states. By utilizing this oscillatory
switching behavior we demonstrate a unipolar deterministic SOT switching scheme
by controlling the current pulse duration.

problem is how accurately the correction equations should be solved so as to
ensure that both of the inexact JDSVD methods can mimic their exact

state-of-the-art machine learning systems. Kernel methods form an important
class of techniques that induce a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for
inferring non-linear models through the construction of similarity functions
from data. These methods are particularly preferred in cases where the training
data sizes are limited and when prior knowledge of the data similarities is
available. Despite their usefulness, they are limited by the computational
complexity and their inability to support end-to-end learning with a
task-specific objective. On the other hand, deep neural networks have become
the de facto solution for end-to-end inference in several learning paradigms.
In this article, we explore the idea of using deep architectures to perform
kernel machine optimization, for both computational efficiency and end-to-end
inferencing. To this end, we develop the DKMO (Deep Kernel Machine
Optimization) framework, that creates an ensemble of dense embeddings using
Nystrom kernel approximations and utilizes deep learning to generate
task-specific representations through the fusion of the embeddings.
Intuitively, the filters of the network are trained to fuse information from an
ensemble of linear subspaces in the RKHS. Furthermore, we introduce the kernel
dropout regularization to enable improved training convergence. Finally, we
extend this framework to the multiple kernel case, by coupling a global fusion
layer with pre-trained deep kernel machines for each of the constituent
kernels. Using case studies with limited training data, and lack of explicit
feature sources, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over
conventional model inferencing techniques.

$J$. Our results are in very good agreement with powder diffraction
measurements reported earlier on the Herbertsmithite materials

temperature ($T\approx J/100$) experimental measurements in one important
regard. In line with the experimental observations, the spectral weight has a
diffuse nature, which is predominantly spread along the extended Brillouin-Zone
boundary. However, the maximum intensity is found in our calculations to be at
the $K$ point of the extended Brillouin Zone in contrast to the low temperature
experiments, where it is at the $M$ point. We suggest that experiments should
be done at various temperatures to look for such a crossover of the maximum

Herbertsmithite materials must differ from KLHM in a significant manner.

by the relationship between the negative log-likelihood function and the

energy landscape for the sliced-Wasserstein distance is more well-behaved and
therefore more suitable for a stochastic gradient descent scheme to obtain the

Differently from statistical machine translation, the associations between
source words and their possible target counterparts are not explicitly stored.
Source and target words are at the two ends of a long information processing
procedure, mediated by hidden states at both the source encoding and the target
decoding phases. This makes it possible that a source word is incorrectly
translated into a target word that is not any of its admissible equivalent
counterparts in the target language.
  In this paper, we seek to somewhat shorten the distance between source and
target words in that procedure, and thus strengthen their association, by means
of a method we term bridging source and target word embeddings. We experiment
with three strategies: (1) a source-side bridging model, where source word
embeddings are moved one step closer to the output target sequence; (2) a
target-side bridging model, which explores the more relevant source word
embeddings for the prediction of the target sequence; and (3) a direct bridging
model, which directly connects source and target word embeddings seeking to
minimize errors in the translation of ones by the others.
  Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the
proposed bridging models are able to significantly improve quality of both
sentence translation, in general, and alignment and translation of individual
source words with target words, in particular.

799--821], robust alternatives to the method of least squares are sorely
needed. To achieve robustness against heavy-tailed sampling distributions, we
revisit the Huber estimator from a new perspective by letting the tuning
parameter involved diverge with the sample size. In this paper, we develop
nonasymptotic concentration results for such an adaptive Huber estimator,
namely, the Huber estimator with the tuning parameter adapted to sample size,
dimension, and the variance of the noise. Specifically, we obtain a
sub-Gaussian-type deviation inequality and a nonasymptotic Bahadur
representation when noise variables only have finite second moments. The
nonasymptotic results further yield two conventional normal approximation
results that are of independent interest, the Berry-Esseen inequality and
Cram\'er-type moderate deviation. As an important application to large-scale
simultaneous inference, we apply these robust normal approximation results to
analyze a dependence-adjusted multiple testing procedure for moderately
heavy-tailed data. It is shown that the robust dependence-adjusted procedure
asymptotically controls the overall false discovery proportion at the nominal
level under mild moment conditions. Thorough numerical results on both

60, and 100 s, expressed as model-independent photon fluxes. The limits in both
bands are well below previous HXR microflare detections, though not low enough
to detect events of equivalent T and EM as quiet Sun brightenings seen in soft
X-ray observations. We expect future observations during solar minimum to
increase the \textit{NuSTAR} sensitivity by over two orders of magnitude due to

  Discovery Control","52 pages, 9 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale multiple testing with correlated and heavy-tailed data arises in
a wide range of research areas from genomics, medical imaging to finance.
Conventional methods for estimating the false discovery proportion (FDP) often
ignore the effect of heavy-tailedness and the dependence structure among test
statistics, and thus may lead to inefficient or even inconsistent estimation.
Also, the commonly imposed joint normality assumption is arguably too stringent
for many applications. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a
Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing (FarmTest) procedure for large-scale
simultaneous inference with control of the false discovery proportion. We
demonstrate that robust factor adjustments are extremely important in both
controlling the FDP and improving the power. We identify general conditions
under which the proposed method produces consistent estimate of the FDP. As a
byproduct that is of independent interest, we establish an exponential-type
deviation inequality for a robust $U$-type covariance estimator under the
spectral norm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the advantage of the
proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods especially when the data
are generated from heavy-tailed distributions. The proposed procedures are
implemented in the R-package FarmTest.

exponential decay. We numerically investigate the interplay of the relevant
parameters (initial temperature, Coulomb interaction strength, initial

Finally, we study evolution of the order parameter as the hopping parameter is

at most $d$ defective items from a pool of $n$ items using as few tests as
possible. The celebrated result for the CGT problem is that the number of tests
$t$ can be made logarithmic in $n$ when $d=O(poly(\log n))$. However,
state-of-the-art GT codes require the items to be tested $w=\Omega(d\log n)$
times and tests to include $\rho=\Omega(n/d)$ items (within log factors). In
many applications, items can only participate in a limited number of tests and
tests are constrained to include a limited number of items.
  In this paper, we study the ""sparse"" regime for the group testing problem
where we restrict the number of tests each item can participate in by
$w_{\max}$ or the number of items each test can include by $\rho_{\max}$ in
both noiseless and noisy settings. These constraints lead to an unexplored
regime where $t$ is a fractional power of $n$. Our results characterize the
number of tests $t$ as a function of $w_{\max} (\rho_{\max})$ and show, for
example, that $t$ decreases drastically when $w_{\max}$ is increased beyond a
bare minimum. In particular, if $w_{\max}\leq d$, then we must have $t=n$,
i.e., individual testing is optimal. We show that if $w_{\max}=d+1$, this
decreases suddenly to $t=\Theta(d\sqrt{n})$. The order-optimal construction is
obtained via a modification of the Kautz-Singleton construction, which is known
to be suboptimal for the classical GT problem. For more general case, when
$w_{\max}=ld+1$ for $l>1$, the modified K-S construction requires $t=\Theta(d
n^{\frac{1}{l+1}})$ tests, which we prove to be near order-optimal. We show
that our constructions have a favorable encoding and decoding complexity. We

existing solutions addressing various aspects of interpretability ranging from
identifying prototypical samples in a dataset to explaining image predictions

This paper introduces MARGIN, a simple yet general approach to address a large
set of interpretability tasks MARGIN exploits ideas rooted in graph signal
analysis to determine influential nodes in a graph, which are defined as those
nodes that maximally describe a function defined on the graph. By carefully
defining task-specific graphs and functions, we demonstrate that MARGIN
outperforms existing approaches in a number of disparate interpretability

step in the sequence is associated with a latent variable that is used to
condition the recurrent dynamics for future steps. Training is performed with
amortized variational inference where the approximate posterior is augmented

the variational lower bound, we ease training of the latent variables by adding
an auxiliary cost which forces them to reconstruct the state of the backward

the observed H$\alpha$ transmission spectrum is produced. The atomic hydrogen
level population is computed including both collisional and radiative
transition rates. The Ly$\alpha$ resonant scattering is computed using a
Monte-Carlo simulation. The model transmission spectra are in broad agreement
with the data. Excitation of the H(2$\ell$) population is mainly by Ly$\alpha$
radiative excitation due to the large Ly$\alpha$ intensity. The density of
H(2$\ell$) is nearly flat over two decades in pressure, and is optically thick
to H$\alpha$. Additional models computed for a range of the stellar Lyman
continuum (LyC) flux suggest that the variability in H$\alpha$ transit depth
may be due to the variability in the stellar LyC. Since metal lines provide the
dominant cooling of this part of the atmosphere, the atmosphere structure is
sensitive to the density of species such as Mg and Na which may themselves be
constrained by observations. Since the H$\alpha$ and Na D lines have comparable

We transform the input workflow that is essentially a directed acyclic graph of

enables us to model an arbitrarily complex workflow as a set of simpler
programs running on physical nodes. We delegate a machine learning model to
capture performance metrics for each resource type when it executes different

algorithm takes the prediction metrics from each resource agent and composes
the overall workflow performance metrics by utilizing the structure of the
corresponding Physical Resource Execution Plan.

chunk-level representations into conventional sequential neural encoders, i.e.,
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, to
consider the compositionality of languages in semantic modeling. An SNELSD
model has a hierarchical structure that includes a detection layer and a
description layer. The detection layer predicts the boundaries of latent word
chunks in an input sentence and derives a chunk-level vector for each word. The
description layer utilizes modified LSTM units to process these chunk-level
vectors in a recurrent manner and produces sequential encoding outputs. These
output vectors are further concatenated with word vectors or the outputs of a
chain LSTM encoder to obtain the final sentence representation. All the model
parameters are learned in an end-to-end manner without a dependency on
additional text chunking or syntax parsing. A natural language inference (NLI)
task and a sentiment analysis (SA) task are adopted to evaluate the performance
of our proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs,
knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding
models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and
predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first
translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and
efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the
differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle
seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge
graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces
entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This
regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill
the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the
accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is
important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it.
This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the
regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie
group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the
embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE
is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector
space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of
regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction
task. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is
faster than the original TransE.

information that is nowadays extensively used by both industry and academia.
However, as social graphs contain sensitive information, they need to be
properly anonymized before release. Most of the existing graph anonymization
mechanisms rely on the perturbation of the original graph's edge set. In this
paper, we identify a fundamental weakness of these mechanisms: They neglect the
strong structural proximity between friends in social graphs, thus add
implausible fake edges for anonymization.
  To exploit this weakness, we first propose a metric to quantify an edge's
plausibility by relying on graph embedding. Extensive experiments on three
real-life social network datasets demonstrate that our plausibility metric can
very effectively differentiate fake edges from original edges with AUC (area
under the ROC curve) values above 0.95 in most of the cases. We then rely on a
Gaussian mixture model to automatically derive the threshold on the edge
plausibility values to determine whether an edge is fake, which enables us to
recover to a large extent the original graph from the anonymized graph. We
further demonstrate that our graph recovery attack jeopardizes the privacy
guarantees provided by the considered graph anonymization mechanisms.
  To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a method to generate fake yet
plausible edges given the graph structure and incorporate it into the existing
anonymization mechanisms. Our evaluation demonstrates that the enhanced
mechanisms decrease the chances of graph recovery, reduce the success of graph
de-anonymization (up to 30%), and provide even better utility than the existing
anonymization mechanisms.

subsets of $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$ which, for $k \geq d \geq 2$, satisfies $A_1
\cap\cdots\cap A_d \neq \emptyset$ whenever $|A_1 \cup\cdots\cup A_d| \leq 2k$
for all distinct sets $A_1,\ldots,A_d \in\mathcal{F}$, then $|\mathcal{F}|\leq
\binom{n-1}{k-1}$, with equality occurring only if $\mathcal{F}$ is the family
of all $k$-sized subsets containing some fixed element. This paper proves that
Mubayi's Conjecture is true for all families that are invariant with respect to
shifting; indeed, these families satisfy a stronger version of Mubayi's
Conjecture. Relevant to the conjecture, we prove a fundamental bijective
duality between $(i,j)$-unstable families and $(j,i)$-unstable families.
Generalising previous intersecting conditions, we introduce the
$(d,s,t)$-conditionally intersecting condition for families of sets and prove
general results thereon. We conjecture on the size and extremal structures of
families $\mathcal{F}\in\binom{[n]}{k}$ that are $(d,2k)$-conditionally
intersecting but which are not intersecting, and prove results related to this
conjecture. We prove fundamental theorems on two $(d,s)$-conditionally
intersecting families that generalise previous intersecting families, and we
pose an extension of a previous conjecture by Frankl and F\""uredi on
$(3,2k-1)$-conditionally intersecting families. Finally, we generalise a
classical result by Erd\H{o}s, Ko and Rado by proving tight upper bounds on the
size of $(2,s)$-conditionally intersecting families $\mathcal{F}\subseteq
2^{[n]}$ and by characterising the families that attain these bounds. We extend
this theorem for certain parametres as well as for sufficiently large families
with respect to $(2,s)$-conditionally intersecting families
$\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ whose members have at most a fixed number $u$

are largely ignored by present speaker recognition research. However, these
trivial events are highly valuable in some particular circumstances such as
forensic examination, as they are less subjected to intentional change, so can
be used to discover the genuine speaker from disguised speech. In this paper,
we collect a trivial event speech database that involves 75 speakers and 6
types of events, and report preliminary speaker recognition results on this
database, by both human listeners and machines. Particularly, the deep feature
learning technique recently proposed by our group is utilized to analyze and
recognize the trivial events, which leads to acceptable equal error rates
(EERs) despite the extremely short durations (0.2-0.5 seconds) of these events.
Comparing different types of events, 'hmm' seems more speaker discriminative.

such as large head pose and movements, use of eyeglasses, illumination and eye

revisit this challenge and introduce a real-time multi-camera eye tracking
framework to improve the tracking robustness. First, differently from previous
work, we design a multi-view tracking setup that allows for acquiring multiple
eye appearances simultaneously. Leveraging multi-view appearances enables to
more reliably detect gaze features under challenging conditions, particularly
when they are obstructed in conventional single-view appearance due to large
head movements or eyewear effects. The features extracted on various
appearances are then used for estimating multiple gaze outputs. Second, we
propose to combine estimated gaze outputs through an adaptive fusion mechanism
to compute user's overall point of regard. The proposed mechanism firstly
determines the estimation reliability of each gaze output according to user's
momentary head pose and predicted gazing behavior, and then performs a
reliability-based weighted fusion. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
with extensive simulations and user experiments on a collected dataset
featuring 20 subjects. Our results show that in comparison with
state-of-the-art eye trackers, the proposed framework provides not only a
significant enhancement in accuracy but also a notable robustness. Our
prototype system runs at 30 frames-per-second (fps) and achieves 1 degree
accuracy under challenging experimental scenarios, which makes it suitable for
applications demanding high accuracy and robustness.

have showed tidal detonation in previous studies results from unphysical
heating due to low-resolution simulations, and such unphysical heating occurs
in 3-dimensional (3D) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations even
with $10$ million SPH particles. In order to avoid such unphysical heating, we
perform 3D SPH simulations up to $300$ million SPH particles, and 1D mesh
simulations using flow structure in the 3D SPH simulations for 1D initial
conditions. The 1D mesh simulations have higher resolution than the 3D SPH
simulations. We show tidal detonation occurs, and confirm this result is
perfectly converged with different space resolution in both 3D SPH and 1D mesh
simulations. We find detonation waves independently arises in leading parts of
the WD, and yield large amounts of $^{56}$Ni. Although detonation waves are not
generated in trailing parts of the WD, the trailing parts receive detonation
waves generated in the leading parts, and leave large amounts of Si group
elements. Eventually, this He WD TDE would synthesize $^{56}$Ni of

a luminous thermonuclear transient comparable to type Ia supernovae.

for the spin-orbit coupling, which are induced not only by torsion, but also
curvature. Moreover, in the circular case, the spin also couples with an
intrinsic angular momentum, which describes the azimuthal motions mapped on the

the dominant instabilities to be $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, and $s_{\pm}$-wave

fluctuations the intra and interband Coulomb repulsion are of the same
strength, which yields the strongly anisotropic behaviour of the
superconducting gaps on the Fermi surface in agreement with recent ARPES
findings. In addition, we find that the Fermi surface topology for BiS$_2$

on the statistics of sector entrance, without memory. The SMBI algorithm
instead scans sectors in a deterministic sequence selected according to the
statistics of sector entrance and time of entrance, and taking into account the
fact that the user has not yet been discovered (thus including memory). We
assess the performance of the proposed methods in terms of average discovery

  When the coupling is sufficiently strong, the limit behavior of the system is
more complex. We prove that a wide class of initial measures approach a point
mass with support moving chaotically on the circle. This can be interpreted as
synchronization in a chaotic state.

moving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human
migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications,
international trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and
public policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity
models or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based
on population and distance features only. These models have been validated on
commuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in
modeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are
not available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and
are therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We
propose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of
exogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our
machine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a
variety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations
between US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive
machine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with
which to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as
potential sea level rise or population growth scenarios.

can be employed to predict their existence. This intuitive observation indeed
led many researchers to endow appearance-based detectors with explicit
reasoning about context. The underlying thesis suggests that stronger
contextual relations would facilitate greater improvements in detection
capacity. In practice, however, the observed improvement in many cases is
modest at best, and often only marginal. In this work we seek to improve our
understanding of this phenomenon, in part by pursuing an opposite approach.
Instead of attempting to improve detection scores by employing context, we
treat the utility of context as an optimization problem: to what extent can
detection scores be improved by considering context or any other kind of
additional information? With this approach we explore the bounds on improvement
by using contextual relations between objects and provide a tool for
identifying the most helpful ones. We show that simple co-occurrence relations
can often provide large gains, while in other cases a significant improvement
is simply impossible or impractical with either co-occurrence or more precise
spatial relations. To better understand these results we then analyze the
ability of context to handle different types of false detections, revealing
that tested contextual information cannot ameliorate localization errors,
severely limiting its gains. These and additional insights further our
understanding on where and why utilization of context for object detection
succeeds and fails.

  Components of Ensembles","12 Pages, 4 Figures, 12 Pages, Under Review in SDM 2018",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For many applications, an ensemble of base classifiers is an effective
solution. The tuning of its parameters(number of classes, amount of data on
which each classifier is to be trained on, etc.) requires G, the generalization
error of a given ensemble. The efficient estimation of G is the focus of this
paper. The key idea is to approximate the variance of the class
scores/probabilities of the base classifiers over the randomness imposed by the
training subset by normal/beta distribution at each point x in the input
feature space. We estimate the parameters of the distribution using a small set
of randomly chosen base classifiers and use those parameters to give efficient
estimation schemes for G. We give empirical evidence for the quality of the
various estimators. We also demonstrate their usefulness in making design
choices such as the number of classifiers in the ensemble and the size of a
subset of data used for training that is needed to achieve a certain value of
generalization error. Our approach also has great potential for designing
distributed ensemble classifiers.

fit a generalized linear model (GLM) with past data as covariate inputs. There
remain challenges to conducting inference for short time series length. By
treating the historical data as covariate inputs, standard errors of estimates
of GLM parameters computed using the empirical Fisher information do not fully
account the auto-correlation in the data. To overcome this serious limitation,
we derive the exact conditional Fisher information matrix of a general logistic
autoregressive model with endogenous covariates for any series length $T$.
Moreover, we also develop an iterative computational formula that allows for
relatively easy implementation of the proposed estimator. Our simulation
studies show that confidence intervals derived using the exact Fisher
information matrix tend to be narrower than those utilizing the empirical
Fisher information matrix while maintaining type I error rates at or below
nominal levels. Further, we establish that the exact Fisher information matrix
approaches, as T tends to infinity, the asymptotic Fisher information matrix
previously derived for binary time series data. The developed exact conditional
Fisher information matrix is applied to time-series data on respiratory rate
among a cohort of expectant mothers where it is found to provide narrower
confidence intervals for functionals of scientific interest and lead to greater
statistical power when compared to the empirical Fisher information matrix.

We establish the sharpness of the sufficient conditions on the solvability thus

matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) kernel. Architectural diversity among
different processors together with structural diversity among different sparse
matrices lead to bottleneck diversity. This justifies an SpMV optimizer that is
both matrix- and architecture-adaptive through runtime specialization. To this
direction, we present an approach that first identifies the performance
bottlenecks of SpMV for a given sparse matrix on the target platform either
through profiling or by matrix property inspection, and then selects suitable
optimizations to tackle those bottlenecks. Our optimization pool is based on
the widely used Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) sparse matrix storage format and
has low preprocessing overheads, making our overall approach practical even in
cases where fast decision making and optimization setup is required. We
evaluate our optimizer on three x86-based computing platforms and demonstrate
that it is able to distinguish and appropriately optimize SpMV for the majority
of matrices in a representative test suite, leading to significant speedups
over the CSR and Inspector-Executor CSR SpMV kernels available in the latest
release of the Intel MKL library.

ensemble, by introducing a fixed trace constraint for its second moment. Like
for the canonical Ginibre ensemble, its complex eigenvalues can be interpreted
as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas, which are now subject to a constraint and a
modified, collective confining potential. Despite the lack of determinantal
structure in this fixed trace ensemble, we compute all its density correlation
functions at finite matrix size and compare to a fixed trace ensemble of normal
matrices, representing a different Coulomb gas. Our main tool of investigation
is the Laplace transform, that maps back the fixed trace to the induced Ginibre
ensemble. Products of random matrices have been used to study the Lyapunov and
stability exponents for chaotic dynamical systems, where the latter are based
on the complex eigenvalues of the product matrix. Because little is known about
the universality of the eigenvalue distribution of such product matrices, we
then study the product of $m$ induced Ginibre matrices with a fixed trace
constraint - which are clearly non-Gaussian - and $M-m$ such Ginibre matrices
without constraint. Using an $m$-fold inverse Laplace transform, we obtain a
concise result for the spectral density of such a mixed product matrix at
finite matrix size, for arbitrary fixed $m$ and $M$. Very recently local and
global universality was proven by the authors and their coworker for a more
general, single elliptic fixed trace ensemble in the bulk of the spectrum.
Here, we argue that the spectral density of mixed products is in the same
universality class as the product of $M$ independent induced Ginibre ensembles.

volume of a glass-forming liquid, which has been driven out of equilibrium,
changes with time while the system evolves towards a metastable state. The
theoret- ical explanation of this phenomenon has attracted much interest even
in recent years, because of its relation with some subtle aspects of the still
elusive nature of the glass transition. In fact, even if there is a rather
general consensus on the fact that what is experimentally observed on cooling
is the dramatic effect produced by the dynam- ical arrest of slower degrees of

phenomenology can be justified upon assuming the existence of an underlying
(possibly, high order) phase transition at lower temperatures.

architecture is based on Encoder-Decoder style. We use a SqueezeNet-like
encoder and a decoder formed by our proposed squeeze-decoder module and
upsample layer using downsample indices like in SegNet and we add a
deconvolution layer to provide final multi-channel feature map. On datasets

key problems of our time, as, for example, the reduction of air pollution and
the redistribution of scarce resources. For the well-being of our societies, it
is thus crucial to find mechanisms to promote pro-social choices over egoistic
ones. Particularly important, because cheap and easy to implement, are those
mechanisms that can change people's behaviour without forbidding any options or
significantly changing their economic incentives, the so-called ""nudges"".
Previous research has found that moral nudges (e.g., making norms salient) can
promote pro-social behaviour. However, little is known about whether their
effect persists over time and spills across context. This question is key in
light of research showing that pro-social actions are often followed by selfish
actions, thus suggesting that some moral manipulations may backfire. Here we
present a class of simple moral nudges that have a great positive impact on
pro-sociality. In Studies 1-4 (total N = 1,400), we use economic games to
demonstrate that asking subjects to self-report ""what they think is the morally
right thing to do"" does not only increase pro-sociality in the choice
immediately after, but also in subsequent choices, and even when the social
context changes. In Study 5, we explore whether moral nudges promote charity
donations to humanitarian organisations in a large (N=1,800) crowdfunding
campaign. We find that, in this context, moral nudges increase donations by
about 44 percent.

determine the best values of spectral parameters and its errors. The
correlations of synchrotron peak luminosity $L_{pk}^*$ and its peak frequency
$\nu_{pk}^*$, SSC-dominant factor $\xi_s$ and $\nu_{pk}^*$, and their
implications as to the spectral evolution were studied. The statistical
analysis and the comparison with theoretical approximation indicate that:
(1)the spectral evolution in $L_{pk}^*-\nu_{pk}^*$ plane may not only ascribed
to variation of the characteristic energy $\gamma_{br}^\prime$ of the employed
electron energy distribution (EED), but that other quantities must be varying
as well.(2) for the spectral evolution in $\xi_s-\nu_{pk}^*$ plane the magnetic
field $B^\prime$ may play the dominant role, and $\gamma_{br}^\prime$ may be
considered to be the subdominant role. (3) Variation of the beaming factor
$\delta_b$ may be mainly responsible for the absence of a possible correlation,
since $B^\prime$ is strongly anti-correlated with the size of radiation zone
$R_b^\prime$. The relation is agreement with that derived from the analytical
theory, and should be self-consistent with the underling acceleration mechanism
of the employed EED. By assuming a conical jet with opening angle

molecular structures may be a relevant component in the total wave function of
such resonances.
  In this work, the state of meson-meson molecules calculations is reviewed,
using a non-relativistic constituent quark model that has been applied to a
wide range of hadronic observables, and therefore all model parameters are
completely constrained. The model has been able to reproduce, among others, the
properties of the X(3872), described as a mixture of $c\bar c$ and $D\bar
D^\ast$ states, or the spectrum of the P-wave charm-strange mesons, which are
well reproduced only if $DK$ and $D^\ast K$ structures are taken into account.

ordinary heavy meson spectra, is also capable of providing a good description

opinions about new products, social trends and political issues via their
interactions. It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially
diffuses the information, ie, finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is
known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection
probability cannot be beyond 31 percent for regular trees, if we just estimate
the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source
often entails the process of querying that asks ""Are you the rumor source?"" or
""Who tells you the rumor?"" that would increase the chance of detecting the
source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch
querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that
queries can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation
algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the
amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that
querying significantly improves the detection performance. We perform extensive
simulations to validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world

pushing the frontiers of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a
tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control.
However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks,
require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily
include known constraints and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond
the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit the use of these
techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for
example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we
extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling
procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of
these models to enhance the performance of model predictive control (MPC),
based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the
fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them
interpretable, generalizable, and reducing the burden of training data. We show
that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires
significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to
noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and
execution in response to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows
improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may
provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is
demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges,
including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8
aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.

asymptotic limit of large Reynolds numbers. Based on the inviscid invariance of
total energy, an exact relation is derived for homogeneous, (not necessarily
isotropic) turbulence. A modified definition for the two-point energy
correlation functions is used to comply with the requirement of detailed energy
equipartition in the acoustic limit. In contrast to the previous relations
(Galtier and Banerjee, Phys. Rev. Lett., 107, 134501, 2011; Banerjee and
Galtier, Phys. Rev. E, 87, 013019, 2013), the current exact relation shows that
the pressure dilatation terms plays practically no role in the energy cascade.
Both the flux and source terms are written in terms of two-point differences.
Sources enter the relation in a form of mixed second-order structure functions.
Unlike kinetic and thermodynamic potential energy, gravitational contribution
is absent from the flux term. An estimate shows that for the isotropic case,
the correlation between density and gravitational acceleration may play an
important role in modifying the energy transfer in self-gravitating turbulence.
The exact relation is also written in an alternative form in terms of two-point
correlation functions, which is then used to describe scale-by-scale energy
budget in spectral space.

between the H$_{\rm I}$-bright and CO-bright regions. Jointly probing H$_{\rm
I}$, CO, and DNM gas, we aim to constrain the threshold of the H$_{\rm

different phases and to test their relation to cloud properties. We have used
dust optical depth measurements at 353 GHz, $\gamma$-ray maps at GeV energies,
and H$_{\rm I}$ and CO line data to trace the gas column densities and map the
DNM in nearby clouds toward the Galactic anticentre and Chamaeleon regions. The
onset of detectable CO intensities varies by only a factor of 4 from cloud to
cloud, between 0.6$ \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 2.5$ \times 10^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$ in total gas column density. We observe larger H$_2$ column densities
than linearly inferred from the CO intensities at $A_{\rm{V}}> 3$ magnitudes
because of the large CO optical thickness: the additional H$_2$ mass in this
regime represents on average 20$\%$ of the CO-inferred molecular mass. In the
DNM envelopes, we find that the fraction of diffuse CO-dark H$_2$ in the
molecular column densities decreases with increasing $A_{\rm{V}}$ in a cloud.
For a half molecular DNM, the fraction decreases from more than 80$\%$ at 0.4
magnitude to less than 20$\%$ beyond 2 magnitudes. In mass, the DNM fraction
varies with the cloud properties. The mass present in the DNM envelopes appears
to scale with the molecular mass seen in CO as $M_{\rm H}^{\rm DNM} = (62 \pm
7) {M_{\rm H_2}^{\rm CO}}^{\,0.51 \pm 0.02}$ across two decades in mass. The
phase transitions in these clouds show both common trends and environmental
differences.

system's malfunction based on a formal system model and observations of the
system behavior. When a malfunction is detected, there is usually not enough
information available to pinpoint the real cause and one needs to discriminate
between multiple fault hypotheses (called diagnoses). To this end, Sequential
Diagnosis approaches ask an oracle for additional system measurements.
  This work presents strategies for (optimal) measurement selection in
model-based sequential diagnosis. In particular, assuming a set of leading
diagnoses being given, we show how queries (sets of measurements) can be
computed and optimized along two dimensions: expected number of queries and
cost per query. By means of a suitable decoupling of two optimizations and a
clever search space reduction the computations are done without any inference
engine calls. For the full search space, we give a method requiring only a
polynomial number of inferences and show how query properties can be guaranteed
which existing methods do not provide. Evaluation results using real-world
problems indicate that the new method computes (virtually) optimal queries
instantly independently of the size and complexity of the considered diagnosis
problems and outperforms equally general methods not exploiting the proposed
theory by orders of magnitude.

of many studies in recent years. In the presence of only very few labeled
pixels, this task becomes challenging. In this paper we address the following
two research questions: 1) Can a simple neural network with just a single
hidden layer achieve state of the art performance in the presence of few
labeled pixels? 2) How is the performance of hyperspectral image classification
methods affected when using disjoint train and test sets? We give a positive
answer to the first question by using three tricks within a very basic shallow
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture: a tailored loss function, and
smooth- and label-based data augmentation. The tailored loss function enforces
that neighborhood wavelengths have similar contributions to the features
generated during training. A new label-based technique here proposed favors
selection of pixels in smaller classes, which is beneficial in the presence of
very few labeled pixels and skewed class distributions. To address the second
question, we introduce a new sampling procedure to generate disjoint train and
test set. Then the train set is used to obtain the CNN model, which is then
applied to pixels in the test set to estimate their labels. We assess the
efficacy of the simple neural network method on five publicly available
hyperspectral images. On these images our method significantly outperforms
considered baselines. Notably, with just 1% of labeled pixels per class, on
these datasets our method achieves an accuracy that goes from 86.42%
(challenging dataset) to 99.52% (easy dataset). Furthermore we show that the
simple neural network method improves over other baselines in the new
challenging supervised setting. Our analysis substantiates the highly
beneficial effect of using the entire image (so train and test data) for
constructing a model.

that the dc current displays cyclotron resonance at $\omega_c = \omega$,

deficits. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical
sensory structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by-and-large focuses
on the cerebral cortex. These studies found that dyslexia is typically
associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed
left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network. However, findings from animal models
and post-mortem studies in humans suggest that developmental dyslexia might
also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways.
Whether these alterations also exist in developmental dyslexia in-vivo and how
they relate to dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here we used ultra-high
resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and
probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the
visual sensory pathway in dyslexia in-vivo. We discovered that individuals with
developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connections in the direct
pathway between the left visual thalamus (LGN) and left middle temporal area
V5/MT, but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex (V1). In
addition, left V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming
abilities - a key deficit in dyslexia [14]. These findings provide the first
evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the
sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental dyslexia. The results challenge
current standard models and provide novel evidence for the importance of
cortico-thalamic interactions in explaining dyslexia.

been questioned, implying a need for more formal ways to systematically measure
progress, i.e. a path. Here I use the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the
definition of normality by Burke et al. to define a path toward exactness and
straying from the path by separating errors in \r{ho} and E[\r{ho}]. A
consistent path toward exactness involves minimizing both errors. Second, a
suitably diverse test set of trial densities \r{ho}' can be used to estimate
the significance of errors in \r{ho} without knowing the exact densities which
are often computationally inaccessible. To illustrate this, the systems
previously studied by Medvedev et al., the first ionization energies of atoms
with Z = 1 to 10, the ionization energy of water, and the bond dissociation
energies of five diatomic molecules were investigated and benchmarked against
CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z. A test set of four functionals of distinct designs was
used: B3LYP, PBE, M06, and S-VWN. For atomic cations regardless of charge and
compactness up to Z = 10, the energy effects of variations in \r{ho} are < 4
kJ/mol (chemical accuracy) defined here as normal, even though these four
functionals ranked very differently in the previous test. Thus, the off-path
behavior for such cations is energy-wise insignificant and in fact,
indeterminate because of noise from other errors. An interesting oscillating
behavior in the density sensitivity is observed vs. Z, explained by orbital
occupation effects. Finally, it is shown that even large normal problems such
as the Co-C bond energy of cobalamins can use simpler (e.g. PBE) trial
densities to drastically speed up computation by loss of a few kJ/mol in
accuracy.

inter-time relations, the series are grouped and the linear correlation between
each pair of groups is calculated. The relations between them can represent the
scene dynamics and local motions. The introduced grouping strategy helps to
considerably reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, we split the series in
temporal direction in order to preserve long term motions and better focus on
each local time window. In order to extract the cyclic motion patterns, which
can be considered as primary components of various activities, intra-time

modalities. In this paper, we propose a new system to discriminatively embed
the image and text to a shared visual-textual space. In this field, most
existing works apply the ranking loss to pull the positive image / text pairs
close and push the negative pairs apart from each other. However, directly
deploying the ranking loss is hard for network learning, since it starts from
the two heterogeneous features to build inter-modal relationship. To address
this problem, we propose the instance loss which explicitly considers the
intra-modal data distribution. It is based on an unsupervised assumption that
each image / text group can be viewed as a class. So the network can learn the
fine granularity from every image/text group. The experiment shows that the
instance loss offers better weight initialization for the ranking loss, so that
more discriminative embeddings can be learned. Besides, existing works usually
apply the off-the-shelf features, i.e., word2vec and fixed visual feature. So
in a minor contribution, this paper constructs an end-to-end dual-path
convolutional network to learn the image and text representations. End-to-end
learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilize
the supervision. On two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO),
experiments demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, in language based person retrieval, we
improve the state of the art by a large margin. The code has been made publicly

fluctuations, interacting through the non-linearity of the Navier-Stokes
equations, is a central issue in fluid mechanics. It affects a wide range of
flows, such as planetary atmospheres, plasmas or wall-bounded flows, and
hampers turbulence models. We consider the special case of a two-dimensional
flow in a periodic box, for which the mean-flow, a pair of box-size vortices
called \emph{condensate}, emerges from turbulence through an inverse cascade
process. As was recently shown, a perturbative closure describes correctly the
condensate when turbulence is excited at small scales. In this context, we
obtain explicit results for the statistics of turbulence, encoded in the
Reynolds stress tensor. We demonstrate that the two components of the Reynolds
stress, the momentum flux and the turbulent energy, are determined by different
mechanisms. It was suggested previously that the momentum flux is fixed by a
balance between forcing and mean-flow advection: using unprecedently long
numerical simulations, we provide the first direct evidence supporting this
prediction. By contrast, combining analytical computations with numerical
simulations, we show that the turbulent energy is determined only by mean-flow
advection, and obtain for the first time a formula describing its profile in
the vortex.

order to characterize statistically translationally invariant standing waves,
it is essential to consider the correlator $\langle c_0({\mathbf k})

k}) c_0^\dagger({\mathbf k}')\rangle$ (where $c_0({\mathbf k})$ are the complex

""squeezing"" (responsible for converting travelling waves into standing waves
while the fluctuations are outside the horizon) reacts to being fed primordial
standing waves. For translationally invariant systems only one type of standing
wave, with the correct temporal phase (the ""sine wave""), survives squeezing.
Primordial standing waves might therefore be invisible at late times -- or not
-- depending on their phase. Theories with modified dispersion relations behave
differently in this respect, since only standing waves with the opposite
temporal phase survive at late times.

present data showing the importance of the grain size (mostly < 10nm) measured

many assumptions. It is currently agreed upon that hot subdwarf stars can only
be formed through binary interaction, either through common envelope ejection

room-temperature 14 GHz ECRIS at the JYFL accelerator laboratory. The electrons
escaping through the extraction mirror of the ion source were detected with a
secondary electron amplifier placed downstream from a dipole magnet serving as
an electron spectrometer with 500 eV resolution. It was discovered that the EED
in the range of 5 - 250 keV is strongly non-Maxwellian and exhibits several
local maxima below 20 keV energy. It was observed that the most influential ion
source operating parameter on the EED is the magnetic field strength, which
affected the EED predominantly at energies less than 100 keV. The effects of
the microwave power and frequency, ranging from 100 to 600 W and 11 to 14 GHz
respectively, on the EED were found to be less significant. The presented
technique and experiments enable the comparison between direct measurement of
the EED and results derived from bremsstrahlung diagnostics, the latter being
severely complicated by the non-Maxwellian nature of the EED reported here. The
role of RF pitch angle scattering on electron losses and the relation between
the EED of the axially escaping electrons and the EED of the confined electrons

models that predict compact neutron stars (NSs), consistent with the radius
constraints from X-ray observations. Motivated by such a remarkable progress,
we examine the fate of the remnants formed in NS mergers and focus on the roles
of the angular momentum and the mass distribution of the binary NSs. In the
mass shedding limit (for which the dimensionless angular momentum equals to the
Keplerian value, i.e., $j=j_{\rm Kep}$), the adopted { seven EoS models, except
H4 and ALF2,} yield supramassive NSs in more than half of the mergers. However,
for $j\lesssim 0.7j_{\rm Kep}$, the presence or absence of a non-negligible
fraction of supramassive NSs formed in the mergers depends sensitively on both
the EoS and the mass distribution of the binary systems. The NS mergers with a
total gravitational mass $\leq 2.6M_\odot$ are found to be able to shed
valuable light on both the EoS model and the angular momentum of the remnants
if supramassive NSs are still absent. We have also discussed the uncertainty on
estimating the maximum gravitational mass of non-rotating NSs ($M_{\rm max}$)
due to the unknown $j$ of the pre-collapse remnants. With the data of GW170817
and the assumption of the mass loss of $0.03M_\odot$, we have $M_{\rm
max}<(2.19,~2.32)M_\odot$ (90\% confidence level) for $j=(1.0,~0.8)j_{\rm
Kep}$, respectively.

dynamic risk-indifference pricing criteria derived from a fully-dynamic family
of risk measures on the $L_p$-spaces for $p\in [1,\infty]$. The concept of
fully-dynamic risk measures extends the one of dynamic risk measures by adding
the actual possibility of changing the risk perspectives over time. The family
is then characterised by a double time index. Our framework fits well the study
of both short and long term investments. In this dynamic framework we analyse
whether the risk-indifference pricing criterion actually provides a proper
convex price system, for which time-consistency is guaranteed. It turns out
that the analysis is quite delicate and necessitates an adequate setting. This
entails the use of capacities and an extension of the whole price system to the
Banach spaces derived by the capacity seminorms.
  Furthermore, we consider the relationship of the fully-dynamic
risk-indifference price with no-good-deal bounds. Recall that no-good-deal
pricing guarantees that not only arbitrage opportunities are excluded, but also
all deals that are ""too good to be true"". We shall provide necessary and
sufficient conditions on the fully-dynamic risk measures so that the
corresponding risk-indifference prices satisfy the no-good-deal bounds. The use
of no-good-deal bounds also provides a method to select the risk measures and
then construct a proper fully-dynamic risk-indifference price system in the

virtual method/function dispatch to the JVM. This hybrid approach---declarative
in the large, trusting the programmer's ability to utilize PC object model
efficiently in the small---results in a system that is ideal for the

proposed by Alan Turing. He assumed that two kinds of morphogens diffuse on a
surface and interact with each other, generating a reaction-diffusion
mechanism. We developed a new framework for pattern generation incorporating a
non-diffusing transcription factor in the system. The diffusion factors (one
inhibitor and one activator) acting on cell surface receptors modulate the
activity of a transcription factor. The difference in the local concentration
of diffusion factors is translated into the degree of activation of
transcription factors. The speed of this process determines then pattern
formation velocity, i.e. the elapsed time from an initial noisy situation to a
final developed pattern. If the pattern formation velocity slows down compared
to the growth of the surface, the phenomenon of ""growing surface interference""
occurs. We find that this phenomenon might explain the rosette pattern observed
on different types of felids and the pale stripes found between the regular
black stripes of zebras. We also investigate the dynamics between pattern
formation velocity and growth and to what extent a pattern may freeze on
growing domains.

Galerkin (DG) methods to the resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations.
Although similar to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations at first sight,
there are some important differences concerning the resistive MHD equations
that need special focus. The continuous entropy analysis of the ideal MHD
equations, which are the advective parts of the resistive MHD equations, shows
that the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field components must be
incorporated as a non-conservative term in a form either proposed by Powell or
Janhunen. Consequently, this non-conservative term needs to be discretized,
such that the approximation is consistent with the entropy. As an extension of
the ideal MHD system, we address in this work the continuous analysis of the
resistive MHD equations and show that the entropy inequality holds. Thus, our
first contribution is the proof that the resistive terms are symmetric and
positive semi-definite when formulated in entropy space as gradients of the
entropy variables. Moreover, this enables the construction of an entropy stable
DG discretization for the resistive MHD equations. However, the resulting
method suffers from large errors in the divergence-free constraint, since no
particular treatment of divergence errors is included in the standard resistive
MHD model. Hence, our second contribution is the extension of the resistive MHD
equations with proper divergence cleaning based on a generalized Lagrange
multiplier (GLM) strategy. We construct and analyze a DG method that is entropy
stable for the resistive MHD equations and has a built-in GLM divergence
cleaning mechanism. The theoretical derivations and proofs are then verified by
several numerical examples...

lightest black hole binary so far observed, with component masses
$12^{+7}_{-2}\,M_\odot$ and $7^{+2}_{-2}\,M_\odot$ (90% credible intervals).
These lie in the range of measured black hole masses in low-mass X-ray
binaries, thus allowing us to compare black holes detected through
gravitational waves with electromagnetic observations. The source's luminosity

which determines the thermodynamical stability of $A$PbI$_3$ hybrid halide

low ionization energy and the reasonable size for the PbI$_3$ cage to
circumvent the stability issue inherent to hybrid halide perovskites. Here we
propose a new three-membered charged ring radical, which demonstrates a low
ionization energy that renders a good stability for its corresponding
perovskite and a reasonable cation size that translates into a suitable bandgap
for the photovoltaic application. We use ab initio calculations to evaluate a
polymorphism of the crystal structure of the proposed halide hybrid perovskite,
its stability and electronic properties in comparison to the mainstream
perovskites, such as the methylammonium and formamidinium lead iodide. Our

Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer to measure the change in delay of single photons
when we introduce OAM on a ring-shaped beam that is imaged through a focusing

the addition of OAM reduces the delay (accelerates) with respect to the same

experimentally. The recent data of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe
($\eta_B$) can be explained via leptogenesis caused by the effect of the
renormalization group evolution on the Dirac Yukawa couplings, provided the
right handed neutrino mass scale $M_0$ is ranging from $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ GeV
to $\mathcal{O}(10^{12})$ GeV for $\tan\beta =3$. This allowed $M_0$ range
distinguishes with the scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{13})$ GeV concerned by other
effects that also generate the consistent $\eta_B$ from leptogenesis. The
branching ratio of the decay $ \mu \rightarrow\,e\gamma$ may reach the future
experimental sensitivity in the very light values of $M_0$. Hence, it will be
inconsistent with the $M_0$ range predicted from the $\eta_B$ data whenever
this decay is detected experimentally.

complexes, musical notes, show a narrow-band Interspike Interval (ISI) pattern
at the respective fundamental frequency of the tone complex. Still this
fundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the
respective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark
bands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the
basically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These
drop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time
spans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the
fundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary
to pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over
bark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with residue
pitches. The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause
undertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case
overtones can appear. This might explain the musical minor scale, which was
proposed to be caused by undertones already in 1880 by Hugo Riemann, still
until now without knowledge about any physical realization of such undertones.

remains in addition to a second set of diagrams that has no analogue in the

to the study of phase transitions, symmetry breaking, effective equations of

the effective action amounts to the Gibbs free energy, recovering the

significant influence of the plastic shear strain and spin due to a mechanism

shifts in the meaning of words. However, most (if not all) of these approaches
restricted their efforts to uncovering change over time, thus neglecting other
valuable dimensions such as social or political variability. We propose an
approach for detecting semantic shifts between different viewpoints--broadly
defined as a set of texts that share a specific metadata feature, which can be
a time-period, but also a social entity such as a political party. For each
viewpoint, we learn a semantic space in which each word is represented as a low
dimensional neural embedded vector. The challenge is to compare the meaning of
a word in one space to its meaning in another space and measure the size of the
semantic shifts. We compare the effectiveness of a measure based on optimal
transformations between the two spaces with a measure based on the similarity
of the neighbors of the word in the respective spaces. Our experiments
demonstrate that the combination of these two performs best. We show that the
semantic shifts not only occur over time, but also along different viewpoints
in a short period of time. For evaluation, we demonstrate how this approach
captures meaningful semantic shifts and can help improve other tasks such as
the contrastive viewpoint summarization and ideology detection (measured as
classification accuracy) in political texts. We also show that the two laws of
semantic change which were empirically shown to hold for temporal shifts also
hold for shifts across viewpoints. These laws state that frequent words are
less likely to shift meaning while words with many senses are more likely to do
so.

learning hidden representations that can summarize the important factors of
variation behind the data. However, CNNs often criticized as being black boxes
that lack interpretability, since they have millions of unexplained model
parameters. In this work, we describe Network Dissection, a method that
interprets networks by providing labels for the units of their deep visual
representations. The proposed method quantifies the interpretability of CNN
representations by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units and
a set of visual semantic concepts. By identifying the best alignments, units
are given human interpretable labels across a range of objects, parts, scenes,
textures, materials, and colors. The method reveals that deep representations
are more transparent and interpretable than expected: we find that
representations are significantly more interpretable than they would be under a
random equivalently powerful basis. We apply the method to interpret and
compare the latent representations of various network architectures trained to
solve different supervised and self-supervised training tasks. We then examine
factors affecting the network interpretability such as the number of the
training iterations, regularizations, different initializations, and the
network depth and width. Finally we show that the interpreted units can be used
to provide explicit explanations of a prediction given by a CNN for an image.
Our results highlight that interpretability is an important property of deep
neural networks that provides new insights into their hierarchical structure.

allows to perform molecular simulations in an open boundary framework. It
allows to change on the fly the resolution of specific subset of molecules
(usually the solvent), which are free to diffuse between the atomistic region
and the coarse-grained reservoir. So far, the method has been successfully
applied to pure liquids. Coupling the H-AdResS methodology to hybrid models of
proteins, such as the Molecular Mechanics/Coarse-Grained (MM/CG) scheme, is a
promising approach for rigorous calculations of ligand binding free energies in
low-resolution protein models. Towards this goal, here we apply for the first
time H-AdResS to two atomistic proteins in dual-resolution solvent, proving its
ability to reproduce structural and dynamic properties of both the proteins and
the solvent, as obtained from atomistic simulations.

  Features","under submission to Spatial Statistics Journal",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of covariance kernels is ubiquitous in the field of spatial
statistics. Kernels allow data to be mapped into high-dimensional feature
spaces and can thus extend simple linear additive methods to nonlinear methods
with higher order interactions. However, until recently, there has been a
strong reliance on a limited class of stationary kernels such as the Matern or
squared exponential, limiting the expressiveness of these modelling approaches.
Recent machine learning research has focused on spectral representations to
model arbitrary stationary kernels and introduced more general representations
that include classes of nonstationary kernels. In this paper, we exploit the
connections between Fourier feature representations, Gaussian processes and
neural networks to generalise previous approaches and develop a simple and
efficient framework to learn arbitrarily complex nonstationary kernel functions
directly from the data, while taking care to avoid overfitting using
state-of-the-art methods from deep learning. We highlight the very broad array
of kernel classes that could be created within this framework. We apply this to
a time series dataset and a remote sensing problem involving land surface
temperature in Eastern Africa. We show that without increasing the
computational or storage complexity, nonstationary kernels can be used to
improve generalisation performance and provide more interpretable results.

molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of an externally applied
magnetic field. A sufficiently strong magnetic field is found to reduce
disorder induced heating and three body recombination heating of electrons by
constraining electron motion, and therefore heating, to the single dimension
aligned with the magnetic field. A strong and long-lasting temperature
anisotropy develops, and the overall kinetic electron temperature is
effectively reduced by a factor of three. These results suggest that
experiments may increase the effective electron coupling strength using an
applied magnetic field.

used in environmental and climate studies. Spatial modelling for this type of
data presents both methodological and computational challenges. In this work we
illustrate a computationally efficient non parametric framework to model and
estimate the spatial field while accounting for geodesic distances between
locations. The spatial field is modelled via penalized splines (P-splines)
using intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) priors for the spline
coefficients. The key idea is to use the sphere as a surrogate for the Globe,
then build the basis of B-spline functions on a geodesic grid system. The basis
matrix is sparse and so is the precision matrix of the GMRF prior, thus
computational efficiency is gained by construction. We illustrate the approach
on a real climate study, where the goal is to identify the Intertropical
Convergence Zone using high-resolution remote sensing data.

sequence of empirical distributions ($\nu$n) n$\ge$1 associated with an
approximation scheme with decreasing time step ($\gamma$n) n$\ge$1 along an
adapted regular enough class of test functions f such that f --$\nu$(f) is a
coboundary of the infinitesimal generator A. Denote by $\sigma$ the diffusion
coefficient and $\Phi$ the solution of the Poisson equation A$\Phi$ = f --
$\nu$(f). When the square norm of |$\sigma$ * $\Phi$| 2 lies in the same
coboundary class as f , we establish sharp non-asymptotic concentration bounds
for suitable normalizations of $\nu$n(f) -- $\nu$(f). Our bounds are optimal in
the sense that they match the asymptotic limit obtained by Lamberton and
Pag{\`e}s in [LP02], for a certain large deviation regime. In particular, this
allows us to derive sharp non-asymptotic confidence intervals. We provide as
well a Slutsky like Theorem, for practical applications, where the deviation
bounds are also asymptotically independent of the corresponding Poisson
problem. Eventually, we are able to handle, up to an additional constraint on
the time steps, Lipschitz sources f in an appropriate non-degenerate setting.

large deviations for arithmetic progressions in random sets, we prove upper
bounds on the Gaussian width of point sets that are formed by the image of the
$n$-dimensional Boolean hypercube under a mapping
$\psi:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^k$, where each coordinate is a constant-degree
multilinear polynomial with 0-1 coefficients. We show the following
applications of our bounds. Let $[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]_p$ be the random
subset of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ containing each element independently with
probability $p$.
  $\bullet$ A set $D\subseteq \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ is $\ell$-intersective if
any dense subset of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ contains a proper $(\ell+1)$-term
arithmetic progression with common difference in $D$. Our main result implies
that $[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]_p$ is $\ell$-intersective with probability $1 -
o(1)$ provided $p \geq \omega(N^{-\beta_\ell}\log N)$ for $\beta_\ell =
(\lceil(\ell+1)/2\rceil)^{-1}$. This gives a polynomial improvement for all
$\ell \ge 3$ of a previous bound due to Frantzikinakis, Lesigne and Wierdl, and
reproves more directly the same improvement shown recently by the authors and
Dvir.
  $\bullet$ Let $X_k$ be the number of $k$-term arithmetic progressions in
$[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]_p$ and consider the large deviation rate
$\rho_k(\delta) = \log\Pr[X_k \geq (1+\delta)\mathbb{E}X_k]$. We give quadratic
improvements of the best-known range of $p$ for which a highly precise estimate
of $\rho_k(\delta)$ due to Bhattacharya, Ganguly, Shao and Zhao is valid for
all odd $k \geq 5$.
  We also discuss connections with error correcting codes (locally decodable
codes) and the Banach-space notion of type for injective tensor products of
$\ell_p$-spaces.

parameterisations of the component covariance matrices are also accommodated.
This paper thus addresses the equivalent aims of including covariates in
Gaussian parsimonious clustering models and incorporating parsimonious
covariance structures into all special cases of the Gaussian mixture of experts
framework. The MoEClust models demonstrate significant improvement from both
perspectives in applications to both univariate and multivariate data sets.
Novel extensions to include a uniform noise component for capturing outliers

tuning the elasticity of the solid. Most prominently, the substrate deformation
causes an increase in the splashing threshold as compared to impact onto
perfectly rigid surfaces, and can thus lead to splash suppression. Here, we
experimentally determine the splashing threshold for impact on thin membranes
as a function of the tension in the membrane and its elastic properties. The
drop dynamics is correlated to the membrane deformation, which is
simultaneously measured using a laser profilometry technique. The experimental
results enable us to adapt current models for splashing, showing quantitatively
how substrate deformation alters the splashing threshold.

non-standard gravity and galaxy formation models. We describe measurements of
the PVD of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey as a function
of projected separation and galaxy luminosity. Due to the faint magnitude limit
($r < 19.8$) and highly-complete spectroscopic sampling of the GAMA survey, we
are able to reliably measure the PVD to smaller scales ($r_\bot = 0.01$ Mpc/h)
than previous work. The measured PVD at projected separations $r_\bot <~ 1$
Mpc/h increases near-monotonically with increasing luminosity from $\sigma
\approx 200$ km/s at $M_r = -17$ mag to $\sigma \approx 600$ km/s at $M_r
\approx -22$ mag. Analysis of the Gonzalez-Perez (2014) GALFORM semi-analytic
model yields no such trend of PVD with luminosity: the model over-predicts the
PVD for faint galaxies. This is most likely a result of the model placing too
many low-luminosity galaxies in massive halos.

converges exponentially to the actual state. This sufficient condition for
convergence establishes that the distance between the estimate and state is
infinitesimally contracting with respect to some norm on the state-space. In
contrast to existing results for contraction-based observer design, we allow
for contraction with respect to non-Euclidean norms. Such norms have proven
useful in applications. To demonstrate our results, we study the problem of

  Methods in ISM Radio Environment",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Noise power estimation is a key issue in modern wireless communication
systems. It allows resource allocation by detecting white spectral spaces
effectively, and gives control over the communication process by adjusting
transmission power. Thus far, the proposed estimation methods in the literature
are based on spectral averaging, eigenvalues of sample covariance matrix,
information theory, and statistical signal analysis. Each method is
characterized by certain stability, accuracy and complexity. However, the
existing literature does not provide an appropriate comparison. In this paper,
we evaluate the performance of the existing estimation techniques intensively
in terms of stability and accuracy, followed by detailed complexity analysis.
The basis for comparison is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation in simulated
industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band transmission. The source of used
background distortions is complex noise measurement, recorded by USRP-2932 in
an industrial production area. Based on the examined solutions, we also analyze
the influence of noise samples separation techniques on the estimation process.
As a response to the defects in the used methods, we propose a novel noise
samples separation algorithm based on the adaptation of rank order filtering
(ROF). In addition to simple implementation, the proposed method has a very
good 0.5 dB root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and smaller than 0.1 dB resolution,
thus achieving a performance that is comparable with the methods exploiting
information theory concepts.

envelopes around protostars demonstrate the importance of chemistry at low
temperatures, relevant in pre- and protostellar cores. formaldehyde is an
important species in the formation of methanol and more complex molecules.
Here, we present the first study of formaldehyde deuteration on small scales
around the prototypical low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 using high spatial
and spectral resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
observations. Numerous isotopologues of formaldehyde are detected, among them
H$_2$C$^{17}$O, and D$_2^{13}$CO for the first time in the ISM. The large range
of upper energy levels covered by the HDCO lines help constrain the excitation
temperature to 106$\pm$13 K. Using the derived column densities, formaldehyde
shows a deuterium fractionation of HDCO/H$_2$CO=6.5$\pm$1%,
D$_2$CO/HDCO=12.8$^{+3.3}_{-4.1}$%, and D$_2$CO/H$_2$CO=0.6(4)$\pm$0.1%. The
isotopic ratios derived are $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O=805, $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O=3.2 and
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C=56. The HDCO/H$_2$CO ratio is lower than found in previous
studies, highlighting the uncertainties involved in interpreting single dish
observations of the inner warm regions. The D$_2$CO/HDCO ratio is only slightly
larger than the HDCO/H$_2$CO ratio. This is consistent with formaldehyde
forming in the ice as soon as CO has frozen onto the grains, with most of the
deuteration happening towards the end of the prestellar core phase. A
comparison with available time-dependent chemical models indicates that the
source is in the early Class 0 stage.

infinitary proof theory, but their approach and method of proof have not been
incorporated into the corpus of proof theory. More precisely, the admissibility
of cut is proved by double induction, on the cut formula and on the complexity
of the derivations, without using any ordinal assignment, contrary to the
presentation of cut elimination in most standard texts on proof theory.
  We propose a translation (arXiv:1710.08138) and this introduction with the
intent of giving a new impetus to their reception. We also propose a
translation of a preliminary manuscript, ""A preorder-theoretic proof of
consistency"", with the kind permission of Lorenzen's daughter, Jutta Reinhardt.
  The ""Investigations"" are best known for providing a constructive proof of
consistency for ramified type theory without axiom of reducibility. Lorenzen
does so by showing that it is a part of a trivially consistent ""inductive
calculus"" that describes our knowledge of arithmetic without detour. The proof
resorts only to the inductive definition of formulas and theorems. He proposes
furthermore a definition of a semilattice, of a distributive lattice, of a
pseudocomplemented semilattice, and of a countably complete boolean lattice as
deductive calculuses, and shows how to present them for constructing the
respective free object over a given preordered set. This work illustrates that
lattice theory is a bridge between algebra and logic.

popular hypotheses, we demonstrate that lighter-toned skin colors are less
prevalent than darker complexions, and additionally, quantifiable body language
markers do not provide conclusive insights about gender dynamics. Overall,
these gender portrayal parameters reveal the different layers of onscreen
gender politics and can help direct incentives to address existing disparities
in a nuanced and targeted manner.

  Centered on the Episode of Care",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Assessing care quality and performance is essential to improve healthcare
processes and population health management. However, due to bad system design
and lack of access to required data, this assessment is often delayed or not
done at all. The goal of our research is to investigate an advanced analytics
platform that enables healthcare quality and performance assessment. We used a
user-centered design approach to identify the system requirements and have the
concept of episode of care as the building block of information for a key
performance indicator analytics system. We implemented architecture and
interface prototypes, and performed a usability test with hospital users with
managerial roles. The results show that by using user-centered design we
created an analytical platform that provides a holistic and integrated view of
the clinical, financial and operational aspects of the institution. Our
encouraging results warrant further studies to understand other aspects of
usability.

for electronic health record systems. This paper presents a set of archetypes
to represent the main data from the Brazilian Public Hospital Information
System and the High Complexity Procedures Module of the Brazilian public
Outpatient Health Information System. The archetypes from the public openEHR
Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM), were examined in order to select archetypes
that could be used to represent the data of the above mentioned systems. For
several concepts, it was necessary to specialize the CKM archetypes, or design
new ones. A total of 22 archetypes were used: 8 new, 5 specialized and 9 reused
from CKM. This set of archetypes can be used not only for information exchange,
but also for generating a big anonymized dataset for testing openEHR-based
systems.

  High-Dimensional Problems in Complex Product Designs?",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increase of the nonlinearity and dimension, it is difficult for the
present popular metamodeling techniques to construct reliable metamodels. To
address this problem, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is introduced to
construct a highly accurate metamodel efficiently. Considering the inherent
characteristics of the CNN, it is a potential modeling tool to handle highly
nonlinear and dimensional problems (hundreds-dimensional problems) with the
limited training samples. In order to evaluate the proposed CNN metamodel for
hundreds-dimensional and strong nonlinear problems, CNN is compared with other
metamodeling techniques. Furthermore, several high-dimensional analytical
functions are also employed to test the CNN metamodel. Testing and comparisons
confirm the efficiency and capability of the CNN metamodel for
hundreds-dimensional and strong nonlinear problems. Moreover, the proposed CNN
metamodel is also applied to IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA)-based optimization
successfully.

that, when realistic (e.g., finite conductivity) materials are used, small

Given the
vast amount of data handled, understanding the intricate physics and trade-offs
of modulators on-chip allows revealing performance regimes not explored yet.
Here we show a holistic performance analysis for waveguide-based
electro-absorption modulators. Our approach centers around material properties
revealing obtainable optical absorption leading to effective modal
cross-section, and material broadening effects. Taken together both describe
the modulator physical behavior entirely. We consider a plurality of material
modulation classes to include two-level absorbers such as quantum dots, free
carrier accumulation or depletion such as ITO or Silicon, two-dimensional
electron gas in semiconductors such as quantum wells, Pauli blocking in
Graphene, and excitons in two-dimensional atomic layered materials such as
found in transition metal dichalcogendies. Our results show that reducing the
modal area generally improves modulator performance defined by the amount of
induced electrical charge, and hence the energy-per-bit function, required
switching the signal. We find that broadening increases the amount of switching
charge needed. While some material classes allow for reduced broadening such as
quantum dots and 2-dimensional materials due to their reduced Coulomb screening
leading to increased oscillator strengths, the sharpness of broadening is
overshadowed by thermal effects independent of the material class. Further we
find that plasmonics allows the switching charge and energy-per-bit function to
be reduced by about one order of magnitude compared to bulk photonics. This
analysis is aimed as a guide for the community to predict anticipated modulator
performance based on both existing and emerging materials.

as memory units and as computational devices in combination with CMOS. This is
in part due to their nonlinear dynamics, and a strong dependence on the circuit
topology. We provide evidence that also purely memristive circuits can be
employed for computational purposes. In the present paper we show that a
polynomial Lyapunov function in the memory parameters exists for the case of DC
controlled memristors. Such Lyapunov function can be asymptotically
approximated with binary variables, and mapped to quadratic combinatorial
optimization problems. This also shows a direct parallel between memristive
circuits and the Hopfield-Little model. In the case of Erdos-Renyi random
circuits, we show numerically that the distribution of the matrix elements of
the projectors can be roughly approximated with a Gaussian distribution, and
that it scales with the inverse square root of the number of elements. This
provides an approximated but direct connection with the physics of disordered
system and, in particular, of mean field spin glasses. Using this and the fact
that the interaction is controlled by a projector operator on the loop space of
the circuit. We estimate the number of stationary points of the approximate
Lyapunov function and provide a scaling formula as an upper bound in terms of
the circuit topology only.
