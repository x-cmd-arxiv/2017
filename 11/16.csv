the particle considered. As applied to solid-state tunnelling (SST), this
physical law was verified, within the field of spintronics, regarding the
electron spin in early experiments across Ge tunnel barriers, and in the 90s
across Al2O3 barriers. The conservation of the quantum parameter of orbital
occupancy, as grouped into electronic symmetries, was observed in the '00s
across MgO barriers, followed by SrTiO3 (STO). Barrier defects, such as oxygen
vacancies, partly conserve this electronic symmetry. In the solid-state, an
additional subtlety is the sign of the charge carrier: are holes or electrons
involved in transport? We demonstrate that SST across MgO magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs) with a large resistance-area (RA) product involves holes by
examining how shifting the MTJ's Fermi level alters the ensuing barrier heights
defined by the barrier's oxygen vacancies. In the process, we consolidate the
description of tunnel barrier heights induced by specific oxygen-vacancy
induced localized states. Our work opens prospects to understand the concurrent
observation of high TMR and spin transfer torque across MgO-based nanopillars.

interpretation, where Quantum Mechanics merely describes a statistical ensemble
of objects and not individual objects. But this interpretation does not address
why the wave-function plays a central role in the calculations of
probabilities, unlike most other interpretations of quantum mechanics. On the
other hand, Classical Statistical Field Theory suffers from severe mathematical
inconsistencies (specially for Hamiltonians which are non-polynomial in the
fields, e.g. General relativistic statistical field theory). We claim that both
problems are related to each other and we propose a solution to both. We prove:
1) the wave-function is a parametrization of any probability distribution of a
statistical ensemble: there is a surjective map from an hypersphere to the set
of all probability distributions; 2) for a quantum system defined in a
2-dimensional real Hilbert space, the role of the (2-dimensional real)
wave-function is identical to the role of the Euler's formula in engineering,
while the collapse of the wave-function is identical to selecting the real part
of a complex number; 3) the collapse of the wave-function of any quantum system
is a recursion of collapses of 2-dimensional real wave-functions; 4) the
wave-function parametrization is key in the mathematical definition of
Classical Statistical Field Theory we propose here. The same formalism is
applied to Quantum Yang-Mills theory and Quantum Gravity in another article.

Gelfand, Sudipto Banerjee","Spatial Joint Species Distribution Modeling using Dirichlet Processes",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Species distribution models usually attempt to explain presence-absence or
abundance of a species at a site in terms of the environmental features
(socalled abiotic features) present at the site. Historically, such models have
considered species individually. However, it is well-established that species
interact to influence presence-absence and abundance (envisioned as biotic
factors). As a result, there has been substantial recent interest in joint
species distribution models with various types of response, e.g.,
presence-absence, continuous and ordinal data. Such models incorporate
dependence between species response as a surrogate for interaction.
  The challenge we focus on here is how to address such modeling in the context
of a large number of species (e.g., order 102) across sites numbering in the
order of 102 or 103 when, in practice, only a few species are found at any
observed site. Again, there is some recent literature to address this; we adopt
a dimension reduction approach. The novel wrinkle we add here is spatial
dependence. That is, we have a collection of sites over a relatively small
spatial region so it is anticipated that species distribution at a given site
would be similar to that at a nearby site. Specifically, we handle dimension
reduction through Dirichlet processes joined with spatial dependence through
Gaussian processes.
  We use both simulated data and a plant communities dataset for the Cape
Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa to demonstrate our approach. The latter
consists of presence-absence measurements for 639 tree species on 662
locations. Through both data examples we are able to demonstrate improved
predictive performance using the foregoing specification.

four-dimensional theories of gravity coupled to scalar matter and to Abelian
gauge fields. In such theories, the scalar fields are described by a section of
a surjective pseudo-Riemannian submersion $\pi$ over space-time, whose total
space carries a Lorentzian metric making the fibers into totally-geodesic
connected Riemannian submanifolds. In particular, $\pi$ is a fiber bundle
endowed with a complete Ehresmann connection whose transport acts through
isometries between the fibers. In turn, the Abelian gauge fields are ""twisted""
by a flat symplectic vector bundle defined over the total space of $\pi$. This
vector bundle is endowed with a vertical taming which locally encodes the gauge
couplings and theta angles of the theory and gives rise to the notion of
twisted self-duality, of crucial importance to construct the theory. When the
Ehresmann connection of $\pi$ is integrable, we show that our theories are
locally equivalent to ordinary Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories and hence
provide a global non-trivial extension of the universal bosonic sector of
four-dimensional supergravity. In this case, we show using a special
trivializing atlas of $\pi$ that global solutions of such models can be

This is due to the dipole nature of the vorticity and pressure distribution

by summing all the forces that act over an infinitesimally small cylindrical

transmittivity matrices of the structure, involving coupling integrals between
the modes of a planar reference structure and radiative modes. These
expressions are used to derive a physical analysis in configurations where the
effect of the incident polarization is not trivial. We provide numerical
validations of our model. On a technical point of view, we show how the Green's

time-consuming to collect while the predictor information is easy to obtain.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims at utilizing large amounts of `unlabeled'
data along with small amounts of `labeled' data to improve the efficiency of a
classical supervised approach. Though numerous SSL classification and
prediction procedures have been proposed in recent years, no methods currently
exist to evaluate the prediction performance of a working regression model. In
the context of developing phenotyping algorithms derived from electronic
medical records (EMR), we present an efficient two-step estimation procedure
for evaluating a binary classifier based on various prediction performance
measures in the semi-supervised (SS) setting. In step I, the labeled data is
used to obtain a non-parametrically calibrated estimate of the conditional risk
function. In step II, SS estimates of the prediction accuracy parameters are
constructed based on the estimated conditional risk function and the unlabeled
data. We demonstrate that under mild regularity conditions the proposed
estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Importantly, the
asymptotic variance of the SS estimators is always smaller than that of the
supervised counterparts under correct model specification. We also correct for
potential overfitting bias in the SS estimators in finite sample with
cross-validation and develop a perturbation resampling procedure to approximate
their distributions. Our proposals are evaluated through extensive simulation
studies and illustrated with two real EMR studies aiming to develop phenotyping
algorithms for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

  in the large-noise regime",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Explaining the excellent practical performance of the simplex method for
linear programming has been a major topic of research for over 50 years. One of
the most successful frameworks for understanding the simplex method was given
by Spielman and Teng (JACM `04), who developed the notion of smoothed analysis.
Starting from an arbitrary linear program with $d$ variables and $n$
constraints, Spielman and Teng analyzed the expected runtime over random
perturbations of the LP (smoothed LP), where variance $\sigma^2$ Gaussian noise
is added to the LP data. In particular, they gave a two-stage shadow vertex
simplex algorithm which uses an expected $\widetilde{O}(d^{55} n^{86}
\sigma^{-30})$ number of simplex pivots to solve the smoothed LP. Their
analysis and runtime was substantially improved by Deshpande and Spielman (FOCS
`05) and later Vershynin (SICOMP `09). The fastest current algorithm, due to
Vershynin, solves the smoothed LP using an expected $O(d^3 \sigma^{-4} \log^3 n
+ d^9\log^7 n)$ number of pivots, improving the dependence on $n$ from
polynomial to poly-logarithmic.
  While the original proof of Spielman and Teng has now been substantially
simplified, the resulting analyses are still quite long and complex and the
parameter dependencies far from optimal. In this work, we make substantial
progress on this front, providing an improved and simpler analysis of shadow
simplex methods, where our algorithm requires an expected \[ O(d^2 \sqrt{\log
n} \sigma^{-2} + d^3 \log^{3/2} n) \] number of simplex pivots. We obtain our
results via an improved \emph{shadow bound}, key to earlier analyses as well,
combined with improvements on algorithmic techniques of Vershynin. As an added
bonus, our analysis is completely modular, allowing us to obtain non-trivial
bounds for perturbations beyond Gaussians, such as Laplace perturbations.

Minkowski space is the constructive approach which employs the Euclidian path
integral formulation, in the presence of both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared
(IR) regulators, as starting point. The UV regulator is to be taken away by
renormalisation group techniques which in case of success leads to a measure on
the space of generalised Euclidian fields in finite volume. The IR regulator
corresponds to the thermodynamic limit of the system in the statistical physics
sense. If the resulting measure obeys the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, the
actual QFT on Minkowski space is then obtained by Osterwalder-Schrader
reconstruction. In this work we study the question whether it is possible to
reformulate the renormalisation group non-perturbatively directly at the
operator (Hamiltonian) level. Hamiltonian renormalisation would be the natural
route to follow if one had easier access to an interacting Hamiltonian operator
rather than to a path integral, at least in the presence of UV and/or IR
cut-off, which is generically the case in complicated gauge theories such as
General Relativity. Our guiding principle for the definition of the direct
Hamiltonian renormalisation group is that it results in the same continuum
theory as the covariant (path integral) renormalisation group. In order to
achieve this, we invert the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction, which may be
called Osterwalder-Schrader construction of a Wiener measure from the
underlying Hamiltonian theory. The resulting correspondence between reflection
positive measures and Osterwalder-Schrader data consisting of a Hilbert space,
a Hamiltonian and a ground state vector allows us to monitor the effect of the
renormalisation flow of measures in terms of their Osterwalder-Schrader data
which motivates a natural direct Hamiltonian renormalisation scheme.

family-history of breast/ovarian cancer implies that their risk of carrying a
mutation exceeds 10\%. However, as mutation-testing costs fall, prominent
voices have called for testing all women, which would strain clinical resources
by testing millions of women, almost all of whom will test negative. To better
evaluate risk-thresholds for BRCA1/2 testing, we introduce two broadly
applicable, linked metrics: Mean Risk Stratification (MRS) and a
decision-theoretic metric, Net Benefit of Information (NBI). MRS and NBI
provide a range of risk thresholds at which a marker/model is ""optimally
informative"", in the sense of maximizing both MRS and NBI. NBI is a function of
only MRS and the risk-threshold for action, connecting decision-theory to
risk-stratification and providing a decision-theoretic rationale for MRS. AUC
and Youden's index reflect on both the fraction of maximum MRS, and of maximum
NBI, attained by the marker/model, providing AUC and Youden's index with
long-sought decision-theoretic and risk-stratification rationale. To evaluate
risk-thresholds for BRCA1/2 testing, we propose an eclectic approach
considering AUC, Net Benefit, and MRS/NBI. MRS/NBI interpret AUC in the context
of mutation-prevalence and provide a range of risk thresholds for which the
risk model is optimally informative.

apparent; we deduce a limit to the dust mass production rate of only $\sim$
2$\times$10$^{-4}$ kg s$^{-1}$, ruling out the existence of exposed ice
covering more than a few m$^2$ of the surface. Volatiles in this body, if they
exist, must lie beneath an involatile surface mantle $\gtrsim$0.5 m thick,
perhaps a product of prolonged cosmic ray processing in the interstellar
medium. The lightcurve range is unusually large at $\sim$2.0$\pm$0.2

$\sim$230 m $\times$ 35 m. A $\sim$6:1 axis ratio is extreme relative to most
small solar system asteroids and suggests that albedo variations may
additionally contribute to the variability. The lightcurve is consistent with a
two-peaked period $\sim$8.26 hr but the period is non-unique as a result of
aliasing in the data. Except for its unusually elongated shape, 1I/2017 U1 is a
physically unremarkable, sub-kilometer, slightly red, rotating object from

illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference
between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum
due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission
spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric
heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here, we model spot and faculae covering fractions
consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the
associated 0.3-5.5 $\mu$m stellar contamination spectra. We find that large
ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations
and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude and
covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using
realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find stellar
contamination can be more than $10 \times$ larger than transit depth changes
expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that
stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and
therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1
system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with
spot covering fractions $f_{spot} = 8^{+18}_{-7}\%$ and faculae covering
fractions $f_{fac} = 54^{+16}_{-46}\%$. The associated stellar contamination
signals alter transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of
interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15 $\times$ the
strength of planetary features, significantly complicating $JWST$ follow-up
observations of this system. Similarly, we find stellar contamination can lead
to underestimates of bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of $\Delta(\rho)

flagellar filaments. As the bacterium swims forward, all its flagella rotate in
synchrony behind the cell in a helical bundle. When the bacterium changes its
direction, the flagellar filaments unbundle and reorient the cell for a short
period of time before returning to their bundled state and resuming swimming.
This rapid bundling and unbundling is, at its heart, a mechanical process
whereby hydrodynamic interactions balance with elasticity to determine the
time-varying deformation of the filaments. Inspired by this biophysical
problem, we present in this paper what is perhaps the simplest model of
bundling whereby two, or more, straight elastic filaments immersed in a viscous
fluid rotate about their centreline, inducing rotational flows which tend to
bend the filaments around each other. We derive an integro-differential
equation governing the shape of the filaments resulting from mechanical balance
in a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number. We show that such equation may be
evaluated asymptotically analytically in the long-wavelength limit, leading to
a local partial differential equation governed by a single dimensionless
Bundling number. A numerical study of the dynamics predicted by the model
reveals the presence of two configuration instabilities with increasing
Bundling numbers: first to a crossing state where filaments touch at one point
and then to a bundled state where filaments wrap along each other in a helical
fashion. We next provide an intuitive physical model for the crossing
instability and show that it may be used to predict analytically its threshold,
and adapted to address the transition to a bundling state. We then use a
macro-scale experimental implementation of the two-filament configuration in
order to validate our theoretical predictions and obtain excellent agreement.

binaries---such as GW170817---can be used to constrain the nuclear equation of

neutron stars, the response to a weak quadrupolar tidal field is characterized
by four internal-structure-dependent constants called ""Love numbers."" The tidal
Love numbers $k_2^\text{el}$ and $k_2^\text{mag}$ measure the tides raised by
the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components of the applied field, and
the rotational-tidal Love numbers $\mathfrak{f}^\text{o}$ and
$\mathfrak{k}^\text{o}$ measure those raised by couplings between the applied
field and the neutron star spin. In this work we compute these four Love
numbers for perfect fluid neutron stars with realistic equations of state. We
discover (nearly) equation-of-state independent relations between the
rotational-tidal Love numbers and the moment of inertia, thereby extending the
scope of I-Love-Q universality. We find that similar relations hold among the
tidal and rotational-tidal Love numbers. These relations extend the
applications of I-Love universality in gravitational-wave astronomy. As our
findings differ from those reported in the literature, we derive general
formulas for the rotational-tidal Love numbers in post-Newtonian theory and
confirm numerically that they agree with our general-relativistic computations

exist, but they are frequently only designed to perform brain extraction from
images without strong pathologies. Extracting the brain from images with strong
pathologies, for example, the presence of a tumor or of a traumatic brain
injury, is challenging. In such cases, tissue appearance may deviate from
normal tissue and violates algorithmic assumptions for these approaches; hence,
the brain may not be correctly extracted. This paper proposes a brain
extraction approach which can explicitly account for pathologies by jointly
modeling normal tissue and pathologies. Specifically, our model uses a
three-part image decomposition: (1) normal tissue appearance is captured by
principal component analysis, (2) pathologies are captured via a total
variation term, and (3) non-brain tissue is captured by a sparse term.
Decomposition and image registration steps are alternated to allow statistical
modeling in a fixed atlas space. As a beneficial side effect, the model allows
for the identification of potential pathologies and the reconstruction of a
quasi-normal image in atlas space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on four datasets: the IBSR and LPBA40 datasets which show normal images,
the BRATS dataset containing images with brain tumors and a dataset containing
clinical TBI images. We compare the performance with other popular models:
ROBEX, BEaST, MASS, BET, BSE and a recently proposed deep learning approach.
Our model performs better than these competing methods on all four datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves the best median (97.11) and mean (96.88) Dice
scores over all datasets. The two best performing competitors, ROBEX and MASS,
achieve scores of 96.23/95.62 and 96.67/94.25 respectively. Hence, our approach
is an effective method for high quality brain extraction on a wide variety of

periodically modulated along the propagation direction. The additional degree
of freedom represented by the modulation permits to modify the intrinsic

in the comparison of models which have some parameters in common. Planning such

since these designs, unlike locally optimal designs, are efficient even if the

contextual constraints imposed by the detection of additional objects in a
given scene. In this work, we exploit the spatial relations between objects in
order to improve detection capacity, as well as analyze various properties of
the contextual object detection problem. To precisely calculate context-based
probabilities of objects, we developed a model that examines the interactions
between objects in an exact probabilistic setting, in contrast to previous
methods that typically utilize approximations based on pairwise interactions.
Such a scheme is facilitated by the realistic assumption that the existence of
an object in any given location is influenced by only few informative locations
in space. Based on this assumption, we suggest a method for identifying these
relevant locations and integrating them into a mostly exact calculation of
probability based on their raw detector responses. This scheme is shown to
improve detection results and provides unique insights about the process of
contextual inference for object detection. We show that it is generally
difficult to learn that a particular object reduces the probability of another,
and that in cases when the context and detector strongly disagree this learning
becomes virtually impossible for the purposes of improving the results of an
object detector. Finally, we demonstrate improved detection results through use
of our approach as applied to the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.

different pulsation phases for each star. To estimate the gamma
(center-of-mass) velocities of the program stars, we use two independent
methods. The first, `classic' method is based on RR Lyrae radial velocity curve
templates. The second method is based on the analysis of absorption line
profile asymmetry to determine both the pulsational and the gamma velocities.
This second method is based on the Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) technique
applied to analyze the line asymmetry that occurs in the spectra. We obtain
measurements of the pulsation component of the radial velocity with an accuracy
of $\pm$ 3.5 km s$^{-1}$. The gamma velocity was determined with an accuracy
$\pm$ 10 km s$^{-1}$, even for those stars having a small number of spectra.
The main advantage of this method is the possibility to get the estimation of
gamma velocity even from one spectroscopic observation with uncertain pulsation
phase. A detailed investigation of the LSD profile asymmetry shows that the
projection factor $p$ varies as a function of the pulsation phase -- this is a
key parameter which converts observed spectral line radial velocity variations
into photospheric pulsation velocities. As a byproduct of our study, we present
41 densely-spaced synthetic grids of LSD profile bisectors that are based on

must have sufficient computational power or resources to recognize or generate
such languages. Though many approaches have been discussed, one ob- vious
approach to enhancing the processing power of a recurrent neural network is to
couple it with an external stack memory - in effect creating a neural network
pushdown automata (NNPDA). This paper discusses in detail this NNPDA - its
construction, how it can be trained and how useful symbolic information can be
extracted from the trained network.
  In order to couple the external stack to the neural network, an optimization
method is developed which uses an error function that connects the learning of
the state automaton of the neural network to the learning of the operation of
the external stack. To minimize the error function using gradient descent
learning, an analog stack is designed such that the action and storage of
information in the stack are continuous. One interpretation of a continuous
stack is the probabilistic storage of and action on data. After training on
sample strings of an unknown source grammar, a quantization procedure extracts
from the analog stack and neural network a discrete pushdown automata (PDA).
Simulations show that in learning deterministic context-free grammars - the
balanced parenthesis language, 1*n0*n, and the deterministic Palindrome - the
extracted PDA is correct in the sense that it can correctly recognize unseen
strings of arbitrary length. In addition, the extracted PDAs can be shown to be
identical or equivalent to the PDAs of the source grammars which were used to
generate the training strings.

90% confidence. We present a photodynamical model for predicting and computing
PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 and other systems for various assumptions of the planets'
atmospheric states. When marginalizing over the uncertainties on all orbital
parameters, we find that the rate of PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 is about 1.4 per day.
We investigate the prospects for detection of these events with the James Webb
Space Telescope, finding that ~10-20 occultations per year of b and c should be
above the noise level at 12-15 microns. Joint modeling of several of these PPOs
could lead to a robust detection. Alternatively, observations with the proposed
Origins Space Telescope should be able to detect individual PPOs at high
signal-to-noise. We show how PPOs can be used to break transit timing variation
degeneracies, imposing strong constraints on the eccentricities and masses of
the planets, as well as to constrain the longitudes of nodes and thus the
complete three-dimensional structure of the system. We further show how
modeling of these events can be used to reveal a planet's day/night temperature

automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Prior work demonstrates that GANs
can effectively suppress additive noise in raw waveform speech signals,
improving perceptual quality metrics; however this technique was not justified
in the context of ASR. In this work, we conduct a detailed study to measure the
effectiveness of GANs in enhancing speech contaminated by both additive and
reverberant noise. Motivated by recent advances in image processing, we propose
operating GANs on log-Mel filterbank spectra instead of waveforms, which
requires less computation and is more robust to reverberant noise. While GAN
enhancement improves the performance of a clean-trained ASR system on noisy
speech, it falls short of the performance achieved by conventional multi-style
training (MTR). By appending the GAN-enhanced features to the noisy inputs and
retraining, we achieve a 7% WER improvement relative to the MTR system.

the empirically successful aspects of Milgrom's law in galaxies. The dark
matter particle candidates are axion-like, with masses of order eV and strong
self-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the
central regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn
couple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable
choice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.
In this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological
consequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo
profile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we
show how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can
be reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive
high surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law. We
finally point out other expected differences with Milgrom's law, in particular
in dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, tidal dwarf galaxies, and globular
clusters, whose Milgromian or Newtonian behavior depends on the position with
respect to the superfluid core of the host galaxy. We also expect ultra-diffuse
galaxies within galaxy clusters to have velocities slightly above the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation. Finally, we note that, in this framework, photons and
gravitons follow the same geodesics, and that galaxy-galaxy lensing, probing
larger distances within galaxy halos than rotation curves, should follow
predictions closer to the standard cosmological model than those of Milgrom's
law.

for binary-AGN systems are (i) a ""cavity"", where the inner region of the
accretion disk is mostly empty and emission is truncated blueward of the
wavelength associated with the temperature of the innermost ring, or (ii)
""minidisks"", where there is substantial accretion from the cirumbinary disk
onto one or both of the members of the binary, each with their own shock-heated
thin-disk accretion system. We find the X-ray emission to be well-fit with an
absorbed power-law, incompatible with the simple cavity scenario. Further, we
construct an SED of PSO J334 by combining radio through X-ray observations and
find that the SED agrees well with that of a normal AGN, most likely
incompatible with the minidisk scenario. Other analyses, such as locating the
quasar on IR color-color diagrams and analyzing the quasar mass predicted by
the fundamental plane of black hole activity, further highlight the similarity

from PPMXL to determine distances, kinematics, and orbital properties for these

find that more than half have small eccentricities ($e<0.2$) or are on nearly
circular orbits. Slightly more than 20\% of the metal-rich stars have
perigalacticons $R_p>7$ kpc. We find that the highest [Mg/Fe], metal-poor
populations have lower vertical and radial velocity dispersions compared to
lower [Mg/Fe] populations of similar metallicity by $\sim10$ km s$^{-1}$. The
median eccentricity increases linearly with [Mg/Fe] across all metallicities,
while the perigalacticon decreases with increasing [Mg/Fe] for all
metallicities. Finally, the most [Mg/Fe]-rich stars are found to have
significant asymmetric drift and rotate more than 40 km s$^{-1}$ slower than
stars with lower [Mg/Fe] ratios. While our results cannot constrain how far
stars have migrated, we propose that migration processes are likely to have
played an important role in the evolution of the Milky Way, with metal-rich
stars migrating from the inner disk toward to solar neighborhood and past
mergers potentially driving enhanced migration of older stellar populations in
the disk.

transformations known as modular transformations. In the context of
topologically ordered quantum states of matter, these transformations encode
the braiding statistics and fusion rules of emergent anyonic excitations and
thus serve as a diagnostic of topological order. Moreover, modular
transformations of higher genus surfaces, e.g. a torus with multiple handles,
can enhance the computational power of a topological state, in many cases
providing a universal fault-tolerant set of gates for quantum computation.
However, due to the intrusive nature of modular transformations, which
abstractly involve global operations and manifold surgery, physical
implementations of them in local systems have remained elusive. Here, we show
that by folding manifolds, modular transformations can be applied in a single
shot by independent local unitaries, providing a novel class of transversal
logic gates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Specifically, we
demonstrate that multi-layer topological states with appropriate boundary
conditions and twist defects allow modular transformations to be effectively
implemented by a finite sequence of local SWAP gates between the layers. We
further provide methods to directly measure the modular matrices, and thus the
fractional statistics of anyonic excitations, providing a novel way to directly

counterparts using the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey to remove
background active galactic nuclei and globular cluster (GC) sources, and
correcting for completeness, we find that the number of field low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs) per unit stellar V-band light increases significantly with
galactocentric radius. Because the flux limit of the complete sample
corresponds to the Eddington limit for neutron stars in NGC 4472, many of the
~90 field LMXBs in this sample could host black holes. The excess of field
LMXBs at large galactocentric radii may be partially caused by natal kicks on
black holes and neutron stars in binary systems in the inner part of the
galaxy. Furthermore, since the metallicity in the halo of NGC 4472 strongly
decreases towards larger galactocentric radii, the number of field LMXBs per
unit stellar mass is anti-correlated with metallicity, opposite to what is
observed in GCs. Another way to explain the spatial distribution of field LMXBs
is therefore a reversed metallicity effect, although we have not identified a
mechanism to explain this in terms of stellar and binary evolution.

polarization and total flux density observations of blazars from the mid-1960s
until June 2012 providing an unprecedented record tracking centimeter-band
variability over decades at 14.5, 8.0, and 4.8 GHz for both targeted objects
and members of flux-limited samples. In the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s,
and during the last decade of the program, observations were additionally
obtained of circular polarization for a small sample of radio-bright (S>5Jy),
active sources. Key program results include evidence supporting class-dependent
differences in the magnetic field geometry of BL Lac and QSO jets,
identification of linear polarization changes temporally associated with flux
outbursts supporting a shock-in-jet scenario, and determination of the spectral
evolution of the Stokes V amplitude and polarity for testing proposed models.
Recent radiative transfer modeling during large flares supports a jet scenario
with a kinetically-dominated, relativistic flow at parsec scales with embedded
turbulent magnetic fields and dynamically-weak ordered components which may be
helical; the circular polarization observations are consistent with
linear-to-circular mode conversion within this turbulent jet environment.

  Models",,,,,"cs.DS cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by Internet advertising applications, online allocation problems
have been studied extensively in various adversarial and stochastic models.
While the adversarial arrival models are too pessimistic, many of the
stochastic (such as i.i.d or random-order) arrival models do not realistically
capture uncertainty in predictions. A significant cause for such uncertainty is
the presence of unpredictable traffic spikes, often due to breaking news or
similar events. To address this issue, a simultaneous approximation framework
has been proposed to develop algorithms that work well both in the adversarial
and stochastic models; however, this framework does not enable algorithms that
make good use of partially accurate forecasts when making online decisions. In
this paper, we propose a robust online stochastic model that captures the
nature of traffic spikes in online advertising. In our model, in addition to
the stochastic input for which we have good forecasting, an unknown number of
impressions arrive that are adversarially chosen. We design algorithms that
combine a stochastic algorithm with an online algorithm that adaptively reacts
to inaccurate predictions. We provide provable bounds for our new algorithms in
this framework. We accompany our positive results with a set of hardness
results showing that our algorithms are not far from optimal in this framework.
As a byproduct of our results, we also present improved online algorithms for a
slight variant of the simultaneous approximation framework.

their distinct characteristics. This diversity reflects the diversity in the
progenitor stars. It is not entirely clear how different evolutionary paths
leading massive stars to become a SN are governed by fundamental parameters
such as progenitor initial mass and metallicity. This paper places constraints
on progenitor initial mass and metallicity in distinct core-collapse SN
subclasses, through a study of the parent stellar populations at the explosion
sites. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 83 nearby SN explosion sites with a
median distance of 18 Mpc has been collected and analysed, enabling detection
and spectral extraction of the parent stellar population of SN progenitors.
From the parent stellar population spectrum, the initial mass and metallicity
of the coeval progenitor are derived by means of comparison to simple stellar
population models and strong-line methods. Additionally, near-infrared IFS was
employed to characterise the star formation history at the explosion sites. No
significant metallicity differences are observed among distinct SN types. The
typical progenitor mass is found to be highest for SN Ic, followed by type Ib,
then types IIb and II. SN IIn is the least associated with young stellar
populations and thus massive progenitors. However, statistically significant
differences in progenitor initial mass are observed only when comparing SNe IIn
with other subclasses. Stripped-envelope SN progenitors with initial mass
estimate lower than 25~$M_\odot$ are found; these are thought to be the result
of binary progenitors. Confirming previous studies, these results support the
notion that core-collapse SN progenitors cannot arise from single-star channel
only, and both single and binary channels are at play in the production of
core-collapse SNe. [ABRIDGED]

graphene whose electronic structure abruptly changes across a covalently bonded
interface. Their rational design offers opportunities for profound
technological advancements enabled by their extraordinary structural and
electronic properties. Thus far the most critical aspect of their synthesis,
the control over sequence and position of heterojunctions along the length of a
ribbon, has been plagued by randomness in monomer sequences emerging from
step-growth copolymerization of distinct monomers. All bottom-up GNR
heterojunction structures created so far have exhibited random sequences of
heterojunctions and, while useful for fundamental scientific studies, are
difficult to incorporate into functional nanodevices as a result. Here we
describe a new hierarchical fabrication strategy that allows deterministic
growth of bottom-up GNRs that preferentially exhibit a single heterojunction
interface rather than a random statistical sequence of junctions along the
ribbon. Such heterojunctions provide a viable new platform that could be
directly used in functional GNR-based device applications at the molecular
scale. Our hierarchical GNR fabrication strategy is based on differences in the
dissociation energies of C-Br and C-I bonds that allow control over the growth
sequence of the block-copolymers from which GNRs are formed, and consequently
yields a significantly higher proportion of single-junction GNR
heterostructures. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and density functional
theory calculations confirm that hierarchically-grown heterojunctions between
chevron GNR (cGNR) and binaphthyl-cGNR segments exhibit straddling Type I band
alignment in structures that are only one atomic layer thick and 3 nm in width.

economic and geographic factors explaining the probability that any two

the supercurrents flowing around the spot region. The chirality affects also
the sequential stage of thermal quench developing according to the Kibble-Zurek
scenario: besides the generation of vortex-antivortex pairs the quench
facilitates the formation of superconducting domains with different chirality.
These fingerprints of the chiral superconducting state can be probed by any
experimental techniques sensitive to the local magnetic field. The
supercurrents encircling the hot spot originate from the inhomogeneity of the
state with the broken time reversal symmetry and their detection would provide
a convenient alternative to the search of the spontaneous edge currents
sensitive to the boundary properties. Thus, the suggested setup can help to

method using response statistics that was recently formulated by the authors.
The proposed approach formulates the parameter estimation problem of It\^o
drift diffusions as a nonlinear least-squares problem. To avoid solving the
model repeatedly when using an iterative scheme in solving the resulting
least-squares problems, a polynomial surrogate model is employed on appropriate
response statistics with smooth dependence on the parameters. The existence of
minimizers of the approximate polynomial least-squares problems that converge
to the solution of the true least square problem is established under
appropriate regularity assumption of the essential statistics as functions of
parameters. Numerical implementation of the proposed method is conducted on two
prototypical examples that belong to classes of models with wide range of
applications, including the Langevin dynamics and the stochastically forced
gradient flows. Several important practical issues, such as the selection of
the appropriate response operator to ensure the identifiability of the
parameters and the reduction of the parameter space, are discussed. From the
numerical experiments, it is found that the proposed approach is superior
compared to the conventional approach that uses equilibrium statistics to
determine the parameters.

faced by data scientists and spreadsheet users. There are two main challenges
in programmatically joining web data with relational data. First, most websites
do not expose a direct interface to obtain tabular data, so the user needs to
formulate a logic to get to different webpages for each input row in the
relational table. Second, after reaching the desired webpage, the user needs to
write complex scripts to extract the relevant data, which is often conditioned
on the input data. Since many data scientists and end-users come from diverse
backgrounds, writing such complex regular-expression based logical scripts to
perform data integration tasks is unfortunately often beyond their programming
expertise.
  We present WebRelate, a system that allows users to join semi-structured web
data with relational data in spreadsheets using input-output examples.
WebRelate decomposes the web data integration task into two sub-tasks of i) URL
learning and ii) input-dependent web extraction. The first sub-task generates
the URLs for the webpages containing the desired data for all rows in the
relational table. WebRelate achieves this by learning a string transformation
program using a few example URLs. The second sub-task uses examples of desired
data to be extracted from the corresponding webpages and learns a program to
extract the data for the other rows. We design expressive domain-specific
languages for URL generation and web data extraction, and present efficient
synthesis algorithms for learning programs in these DSLs from few input-output
examples. We evaluate WebRelate on 88 real-world web data integration tasks
taken from online help forums and Excel product team, and show that WebRelate
can learn the desired programs within few seconds using only 1 example for the
majority of the tasks.

approach called rigid graph compression (RGC) to describe the transition from
floppy to rigid in disordered fiber networks ('rod-hinge systems'), which form
the reinforcing phase in many composite systems. To establish RGC on a firm
theoretical foundation, we adapt rigidity matroid theory to identify primitive
topological network motifs that serve as rules for composing interacting rigid
par- ticles into larger rigid components. This approach is computationally
efficient and stable, because RGC requires only topological information about
rod interactions (encoded by a sparse unweighted network) rather than
geometrical details such as rod locations or pairwise distances (as required in
rigidity matroid theory). We conduct numerical experiments on simulated
two-dimensional rod-hinge systems to demonstrate that RGC closely approximates
the rigidity percolation threshold for such systems, through comparison with
the pebble game algorithm (which is exact in two dimensions). Importantly,
whereas the pebble game is derived from Laman's condition and is only valid in
two dimensions, the RGC approach naturally extends to higher dimensions.

In addition, the nano-cavities with embedded metasurfaces can support
independently tunable resonances at multiple bands. As a proof-of-concept,
using nano-structured metasurfaces within 100-nm nano-cavities, we
experimentally demonstrate high spatial resolution color filtering and spectral
imaging. The proposed approach can be extrapolated to compact integrated

temporal resolution for effective monitoring of various ecosystem resources.
Due to practical limitations in sensor design, there is often a trade-off in
different resolutions of spatio-temporal datasets and hence a single sensor
alone cannot provide the required information. Various data fusion methods have
been proposed in the literature that mainly rely on individual timesteps when
both datasets are available to learn a mapping between features values at
different resolutions using local relationships between pixels. Earth
observation data is often plagued with spatially and temporally correlated
noise, outliers and missing data due to atmospheric disturbances which pose a
challenge in learning the mapping from a local neighborhood at individual
timesteps. In this paper, we aim to exploit time-independent global
relationships between pixels for robust transfer of information across
different scales. Specifically, we propose a new framework, ORBIT (Ordering
Based Information Transfer) that uses relative ordering constraint among pixels
to transfer information across both time and scales. The effectiveness of the
framework is demonstrated for global surface water monitoring using both

  In 2015-16 A0620-00 was in passive stage (as by Cantrell et al., 2008)
exhibiting the regular orbital light curves and low flickering. In less than
230 days in 2016-17 the system switched into active stage: the brightness
increased by ~0.2-0.3 mag, the orbital light curve changed while the flickering
amplitude increased more than twice.
  The object regular orbital light curves were fitted by models with ""cold""
spots on the optical star surface and without those. These models reproduce the
observed orbital light curves both in passive and in active stages.
  The dependence of the mean square flickering amplitude (in fluxes, extinction
corrected) on wavelength is computed in the lambda 6400-22000AA range. In
active stage, the observed flickering amplitude decreases over the whole
studied range and may be represented as Delta F_fl~lambda^{-2} which
corresponds to the free-free emission of optically thin high-temperature
plasma.
  In passive stage, flickering obeys Delta F_fl~lambda^{-4} law in the range
6400-12500AA that corresponds to the thermal radiation of optically thick
high-temperature plasma. At longer wavelengths the flickering amplitude
dependence is flat which may imply existence of a synchrotron component of the
relativistic jets emission.
  These flickering features let us propose that the flickering mechanism
includes at least two components: thermal and, apparently, synchrotron, that
agrees with the recent discovery of the variable linear polarization of the IR
system emission (Russell et al., 2016).

point is known to lead to chiral mode conversion. But is it necessary to
include this non-Hermitian degeneracy inside the contour for this process to
take place? We show that a slow enough variation of parameters, even away from
the system's exceptional point, can also lead to a robust asymmetric state
exchange. To study this process, we consider a prototypical two-level
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a constant coupling between elements. Closed
form solutions are obtained when the amplification/attenuation coefficients in
this arrangement are varied in conjunction with the resonance detuning along a
circular contour. Using asymptotic expansions, this input-independent mode
conversion is theoretically proven to take place irrespective of whether the
exceptional point is enclosed or not upon encirclement. Our results
significantly broaden the range of parameter space required for the
experimental realization of such chiral mode conversion processes.

constrained optimization problems. Practically, subproblems for updating primal
variables in the framework of ALM usually can only be solved inexactly. The
convergence and local convergence speed of ALM have been extensively studied.
However, the global convergence rate of inexact ALM is still open for problems
with nonlinear inequality constraints. In this paper, we work on general convex
programs with both equality and inequality constraints. For these problems, we
establish the global convergence rate of inexact ALM and estimate its iteration
complexity in terms of the number of gradient evaluations to produce a solution
with a specified accuracy.
  We first establish an ergodic convergence rate result of inexact ALM that
uses constant penalty parameters or geometrically increasing penalty
parameters. Based on the convergence rate result, we apply Nesterov's optimal
first-order method on each primal subproblem and estimate the iteration
complexity of the inexact ALM. We show that if the objective is convex, then
$O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ gradient evaluations are sufficient to guarantee an
$\varepsilon$-optimal solution in terms of both primal objective and
feasibility violation. If the objective is strongly convex, the result can be
improved to $O(\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}}|\log\varepsilon|)$. Finally, by
relating to the inexact proximal point algorithm, we establish a nonergodic
convergence rate result of inexact ALM that uses geometrically increasing
penalty parameters. We show that the nonergodic iteration complexity result is
in the same order as that for the ergodic result. Numerical experiments on
quadratically constrained quadratic programming are conducted to compare the
performance of the inexact ALM with different settings.

employing a flexible mass model which allows for radial gradients in the
stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find that, in the context of our model, a
radially declining stellar-mass-to-light ratio is strongly favoured. Modelling
the stellar mass-to-light ratio as following a power law, $\Upsilon_{\star}
\sim R^{-\mu}$, we infer a power-law slope $\mu = -0.54 \pm 0.05$; equally,
parameterising the stellar-mass-to-light ratio via a central mismatch parameter
relative to a Salpeter IMF, $\alpha$, and scale radius $R_M$, we find $\alpha >
1.48$ at $95\%$ confidence and $R_M = 0.35 \pm 0.04$ kpc. We use stellar
population modelling of high-resolution 11-band HST photometry to show that
such a steep gradient cannot be achieved by variations in only the metallicity,
age, dust extinction and star formation history if the stellar initial mass
function (IMF) remains spatially constant. On the other hand, the stellar
mass-to-light ratio gradient that we find is consistent with an IMF whose inner
slope changes such that it is Salpeter-like in the central $\sim 0.5$ kpc and
becomes Chabrier-like within the stellar effective radius. This adds to recent
evidence that the non-universality of the IMF in ETGs may be confined to their
core regions, and points towards a picture in which the stars in these central
regions may have formed in fundamentally different physical conditions.

wetting angle for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes phase-field model on
voxel-set-type computational domains. These domains typically stem from the
micro-CT imaging of porous rock and approximate a (on {\mu}m scale) smooth
domain with a certain resolution. Planar surfaces that are perpendicular to the
main axes are naturally approximated by a layer of voxels. However, planar
surfaces in any other directions and curved surfaces yield a jagged/rough
surface approximation by voxels. For the standard Cahn-Hilliard formulation,
where the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the domain boundary
(fluid-solid interface/wall) is 90 degrees, jagged surfaces have no impact on
the contact angle. However, a prescribed contact angle smaller or larger than
90 degrees on jagged voxel surfaces is amplified in either direction. As a
remedy, we propose the introduction of surface energy correction factors for
each fluid-solid voxel face that counterbalance the difference of the voxel-set
surface area with the underlying smooth one. The discretization of the model
equations is performed with the discontinuous Galerkin method, however, the
presented semi-analytical approach of correcting the surface energy is equally
applicable to other direct numerical methods such as finite elements, finite
volumes, or finite differences, since the correction factors appear in the
strong formulation of the model.

by a stationary superposition of two Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flows with
chaotic advection along streamlines. In such a flow, we study the evolution of
point-like particles which can decide in which direction to swim, while keeping
the velocity amplitude constant. We show that it is sufficient to endow the
swimmers with a very restricted set of actions (six fixed swimming directions
in our case) to have enough freedom to find efficient strategies to move upward
and escape local fluid traps. The key ingredient is the
learning-from-experience structure of the algorithm, which assigns positive or
negative rewards depending on whether the taken action is, or is not,
profitable for the predetermined goal in the long term horizon. This is another
example supporting the efficiency of the reinforcement learning approach to
learn how to accomplish difficult tasks in complex fluid environments.

Landauer formula gives the electrical conductance to be a function of the

$E$ of the incoming electron. A quantum dragon nanodevice is one which has a
perfectly conducting channel, namely ${\cal T}(E)=1$ for all energies which are
transmitted by the external leads even though there may be arbitrarily strong

to be quantum dragon devices, both for uniform leads and for dimerized leads.

broader applicability in many e-commerce applications. These applications rely
on recommenders for generating advertisements for various offers or providing
content recommendations. However, the quality of the generated recommendations
depends on user features (like demography, temporality), offer features (like
popularity, price), and user-offer features (like implicit or explicit
feedback). Current state-of-the-art recommenders do not explore such diverse
features concurrently while generating the recommendations.
  In this paper, we first introduce the notion of Trackers which enables us to
capture the above-mentioned features and thus incorporate users' online
behaviour through statistical aggregates of different features (demography,
temporality, popularity, price). We also show how to capture offer-to-offer
relations, based on their consumption sequence, leveraging neural embeddings
for offers in our Offer2Vec algorithm. We then introduce BoostJet, a novel
recommender which integrates the Trackers along with the neural embeddings
using MatrixNet, an efficient distributed implementation of gradient boosted
decision tree, to improve the recommendation quality significantly. We provide
an in-depth evaluation of BoostJet on Yandex's dataset, collecting online
behaviour from tens of millions of online users, to demonstrate the
practicality of BoostJet in terms of recommendation quality as well as

system prepared at a hot temperature cools down faster than an identical system
initiated at a cold temperature when both are quenched to an even colder bath.
Such non-monotonic relaxations were observed in various systems, including
water, magnetic alloys, polymers, and driven granular gases. We analyze the
Mpemba effect in Markovian dynamics and discover that a stronger version of the
effect often exists for a carefully chosen set of initial temperatures. In this
\emph{strong Mpemba effect}, the relaxation time jumps to a smaller value
leading to exponentially faster equilibration dynamics. The number of such
special initial temperatures defines the \emph{Mpemba index}, whose parity is a
topological property of the system. To demonstrate these concepts, we first
analyze the different types of Mpemba relaxations in the mean field
anti-ferromagnet Ising model, which demonstrates a surprisingly rich Mpemba
phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the strong effect survives the
thermodynamic limit and that it is tightly connected with thermal overshoot --
in the relaxation process, the temperature of the relaxing system can decay
non-monotonically as a function of time. Using the parity of the Mpemba index,
we then study the occurrence of the strong Mpemba effect in a large class of
thermal quench processes and show that it happens with non-zero probability
even in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by introducing the
\emph{isotropic} model for which we obtain analytical lower bound estimates for
the probability of the strong Mpemba effects. Consequently, we expect that such
exponentially faster relaxations can be observed experimentally in a wide
variety of systems.

key observation of the paper is that the inter-event times, corresponding to
the dip events of the received signal, are fairly robust to the attenuation
through walls (for instance as compared to the exact dip values). We then
propose a methodology that can extract the total number of people from the
inter-event times. More specifically, we first show how to characterize the
wireless received power measurements as a superposition of renewal-type

show how the probability mass function of the inter-event times carries vital

further include areas with different wall materials, such as concrete, plaster,

well-known that such algebras must be nonseparable, and in 2004 Akemann and
Weaver used the diamond principle (a set theoretic axiom independent from ZFC)
to give the first counterexamples. For any such counterexample $A$, the unitary
group $U(A)$ acts transitively on the pure states, which are the extreme points

neural networks (DNNs). This paper presents deep compositional grammatical
architectures which harness the best of two worlds: grammar models and DNNs.
The proposed architectures integrate compositionality and reconfigurability of
the former and the capability of learning rich features of the latter in a
principled way. We utilize AND-OR Grammar (AOG) as network generator in this
paper and call the resulting networks AOGNets. An AOGNet consists of a number
of stages each of which is composed of a number of AOG building blocks. An AOG
building block splits its input feature map into N groups along feature
channels and then treat it as a sentence of N words. It then jointly realizes a
phrase structure grammar and a dependency grammar in bottom-up parsing the
""sentence"" for better feature exploration and reuse. It provides a unified
framework for the best practices developed in state-of-the-art DNNs. In
experiments, AOGNet is tested in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
classification benchmark and the MS-COCO object detection and segmentation
benchmark. In CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, AOGNet obtains better
performance than ResNet and most of its variants, ResNeXt and its attention
based variants such as SENet, DenseNet and DualPathNet. AOGNet also obtains the
best model interpretability score using network dissection. AOGNet further
shows better potential in adversarial defense. In MS-COCO, AOGNet obtains
better performance than the ResNet and ResNeXt backbones in Mask R-CNN.

using large scale three-dimensional (3D) discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD)
simulations. In this model, the first order elastic interaction energy
associated with the hydrogen-induced volume change is accounted for. The
three-dimensional stress tensor induced by hydrogen concentration, which is in
equilibrium with respect to the dislocation stress field, is derived using the
Eshelby inclusion model, while the hydrogen diffusion is treated as a continuum
process. This newly developed framework is utilized to quantify the effect of
different hydrogen concentrations on the dynamics of a glide dislocation in the
absence of an applied stress field as well as on the spacing between
dislocations in an array of parallel edge dislocations. A shielding effect is
observed for materials having a large hydrogen diffusion coefficient, with the
shield effect leading to the homogenization of the shrinkage process leading to
the glide loop maintaining its circular shape, as well as resulting in a
decrease in dislocation separation distances in the array of parallel edge
dislocations. On the other hand, for materials having a small hydrogen
diffusion coefficient, the high hydrogen concentrations around the edge
characters of the dislocations act to pin them. Higher stresses are required to
be able to unpin the dislocations from the hydrogen clouds surrounding them.
Finally, this new framework can open the door for further large scale studies
on the effect of hydrogen on the different aspects of dislocation-mediated
plasticity in metals. With minor modifications of the current formulations, the
framework can also be extended to account for general inclusion-induced stress
field in discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.

  We address these problems by establishing a theoretical link between

allows advances in the extensively studied supervised learning workflow to be
directly transferred to independence testing workflows - including automated
tuning of machine learning type which addresses the need for a heuristic

  We empirically show that our proposed predictive independence test outperform

in the globular cluster Terzan 5. We studied the transient during its quiescent
state using 18 Chandra observations of the cluster acquired between 2003 and
2016. We found an extremely variable source, with a luminosity variation in the
0.5-10 keV energy range of $\sim3$ orders of magnitude (between
$3\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $2\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$) on timescales
from years down to only a few days. Using an absorbed power-law model to fit
its quiescent spectra, we obtained a typical photon index of $\sim1.4$,
indicating that the source is even harder than during outburst and much harder
than typical quiescent neutron stars if their quiescent X-ray spectra are also
described by a single power-law model. This indicates that EXO 1745-248 is very
hard throughout the entire observed X-ray luminosity range. At the highest
luminosity, the spectrum fits better when an additional (soft) component is
added to the model. All these quiescent properties are likely related to strong
variability in the low-level accretion rate in the system. However, its extreme
variable behavior is strikingly different from the one observed for other
neutron star transients that are thought to still accrete in quiescence. We
compare our results to these systems. We also discuss similarities and
differences between our target and the transitional millisecond pulsar IGR
J18245-2452, which also has hard spectra and strong variability during
quiescence.

best possible up to the value of the constants, by approximately decomposing
the complete graph K_n into a packing of such nearly optimal Ramsey R(3,t)

  More precisely, for any \epsilon>0 we find an edge-disjoint collection

to series expansions of appropriate operators and to series expansions for the
effective tensor as a function of the component moduli. It is shown that the
singularity structure of this function can shed much light on the convergence
properties of the iterative Fast Fourier Transform methods. We look at a model
example of a square array of conducting square inclusions for which there is an
exact formula for the effective conductivity (Obnosov). Theoretically some of
the methods converge when the inclusions have zero or even negative
conductivity. However, the numerics do not always confirm this extended range
of convergence and show that accuracy is lost after relatively few iterations.
There is little point in iterating beyond this. Accuracy improves when the grid

Interestingly, despite the strong impact of elections on our daily lives, how
this investment is translated into votes is still unknown. By performing data
analysis and modeling, we show that top candidates spend more money \emph{per
vote} than the less successful and poorer candidates, a sublinearity that
discloses a diseconomy of scale. We demonstrate that such electoral diseconomy
arises from the competition between candidates due to inefficient campaign
expenditure. Our approach succeeds in two important tests. First, it reveals
that the statistical pattern in the vote distribution of candidates can be
explained in terms of the independently conceived, but similarly skewed
distribution of money campaign. Second, using a heuristic argument, we are able
to predict a turnout percentage for a given election of approximately 63\%.
This result is in good agreement with the average turnout rate obtained from

a wide range of problems concerning the adoption process in marketing

spatiotemporal data analysis. An essential ingredient of GRF is the covariance
function that characterizes the joint Gaussian distribution of the field.
Commonly used covariance functions give rise to fully dense and unstructured
covariance matrices, for which required calculations are notoriously expensive
to carry out for large data. In this work, we propose a construction of
covariance functions that result in matrices with a hierarchical structure.
Empowered by matrix algorithms that scale linearly with the matrix dimension,
the hierarchical structure is proved to be efficient for a variety of random
field computations, including sampling, kriging, and likelihood evaluation.
Specifically, with $n$ scattered sites, sampling and likelihood evaluation has
an $O(n)$ cost and kriging has an $O(\log n)$ cost after preprocessing,
particularly favorable for the kriging of an extremely large number of sites
(e.g., predicting on more sites than observed). We demonstrate comprehensive
numerical experiments to show the use of the constructed covariance functions
and their appealing computation time. Numerical examples on a laptop include
simulated data of size up to one million, as well as a climate data product

strong multimode regimes. With the qubit detuned from the cavity, we show that
the dispersive shift behaves according to predictions from a generalized
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. Finally, we observe that the qubit linewidth
strongly depends on its frequency, as expected for spontaneous emission of
phonons, and we identify operating frequencies where this emission rate is

machine learning field for their potential to learn high-dimensional, complex
real data distribution. Specifically, they do not rely on any assumptions about
the distribution and can generate real-like samples from latent space in a
simple manner. This powerful property leads GAN to be applied to various
applications such as image synthesis, image attribute editing, image
translation, domain adaptation and other academic fields. In this paper, we aim
to discuss the details of GAN for those readers who are familiar with, but do
not comprehend GAN deeply or who wish to view GAN from various perspectives. In
addition, we explain how GAN operates and the fundamental meaning of various
objective functions that have been suggested recently. We then focus on how the
GAN can be combined with an autoencoder framework. Finally, we enumerate the
GAN variants that are applied to various tasks and other fields for those who
are interested in exploiting GAN for their research.

ball model for mmWave links, the sectored antenna model for key antenna array
characteristics, and Nakagami-$m$ fading for wireless channels. To reduce the
load of macro-tier BSs, we consider a bias factor $A_{s}$ in the network for
offloading user equipments (UEs) to micro-tier BSs. For this network, we first
analyze the loads of macro- and micro-tier BSs. Then we derive a new expression
for the rate coverage probability of the network, based on which the optimal
$A_{s}$ maximizing the rate coverage probability is found. Through numerical
results, we demonstrate the correctness of our analysis and the validity of the
optimal $A_{s}$. Importantly, the optimal $A_{s}$ can bring a profound
improvement in the rate coverage probability relative to a fixed $A_{s}$.
Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of various network parameters, e.g., the
densities and the beamwidths of BSs, on the rate coverage probability and the
optimal $A_{s}$, offering valuable guidelines into practical mmWave HetNet
design.

to ambiguous matches in texture-less regions when performing dense

learned features for the matching task in dense monocular reconstruction. We
propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture along with a
deeply supervised feature learning scheme for pixel-wise regression of visual

particular, our learning scheme minimizes a multi-view matching cost-volume
loss with respect to the regressed features at multiple stages within the
network, for explicitly learning contextual features that are suitable for
dense matching between images captured by a moving monocular camera along the
epipolar line. We integrate the learned features from our model for depth
estimation inside a real-time dense monocular SLAM framework, where photometric
error is replaced by our learned descriptor error. Our extensive evaluation on
several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate greatly improved accuracy in
dense reconstructions of the well celebrated dense SLAM systems like DTAM,

critical value. These creep-like behaviors comprise three stages: in the
primary and tertiary stages, the strain rate exhibits power-law behaviors with
time, which are well described by the Omori-Utsu and the inverse Omori laws,
respectively, although the exponents are larger than those typically observed
in experiments. A characteristic time that defines the onset of power-law
behavior in the Omori-Utsu law is found to decrease with the strength of
disorder in the system. The analytical solution, which agrees with the above
numerical results, is obtained for the mean-field limit. Beyond the mean-field
limit, the exponent for the Omori-Utsu law tends to be even larger but
decreases with the disorder in the system. Increasing the spatial range of
interactions, this exponent is found to be independent of disorder and to
converge to the mean-field value. In contrast, the inverse Omori law remains
independent of the spatial range of interaction and the disorder strength.

machine learning, such as the image classification. Unfortunately, researchers
have shown that DNNs are easily attacked by adversarial examples, slightly
perturbed images which can mislead DNNs to give incorrect classification
results. Such attack has seriously hampered the deployment of DNN systems in
areas where security or safety requirements are strict, such as autonomous
cars, face recognition, malware detection. Defensive distillation is a
mechanism aimed at training a robust DNN which significantly reduces the
effectiveness of adversarial examples generation. However, the state-of-the-art
attack can be successful on distilled networks with 100% probability. But it is
a white-box attack which needs to know the inner information of DNN. Whereas,
the black-box scenario is more general. In this paper, we first propose the
epsilon-neighborhood attack, which can fool the defensively distilled networks
with 100% success rate in the white-box setting, and it is fast to generate
adversarial examples with good visual quality. On the basis of this attack, we
further propose the region-based attack against defensively distilled DNNs in
the black-box setting. And we also perform the bypass attack to indirectly
break the distillation defense as a complementary method. The experimental
results show that our black-box attacks have a considerable success rate on
defensively distilled networks.

easily extracted from videos to discard background noises. However, current
skeleton representations do not fully benefit from machine learning with CNNs.
We propose ""Skepxels"" a spatio-temporal representation for skeleton sequences
to fully exploit the ""local"" correlations between joints using the 2D
convolution kernels of CNN. We transform skeleton videos into images of
flexible dimensions using Skepxels and develop a CNN-based framework for
effective human action recognition using the resulting images. Skepxels encode
rich spatio-temporal information about the skeleton joints in the frames by
maximizing a unique distance metric, defined collaboratively over the distinct
joint arrangements used in the skeletal image. Moreover, they are flexible in
encoding compound semantic notions such as location and speed of the joints.
The proposed action recognition exploits the representation in a hierarchical
manner by first capturing the micro-temporal relations between the skeleton
joints with the Skepxels and then exploiting their macro-temporal relations by
computing the Fourier Temporal Pyramids over the CNN features of the skeletal
images. We extend the Inception-ResNet CNN architecture with the proposed

approaching human-level performance in face recognition. However, open world
face recognition still remains a challenge. Although, 3D face recognition has
an inherent edge over its 2D counterpart, it has not benefited from the recent
developments in deep learning due to the unavailability of large training as
well as large test datasets. Recognition accuracies have already saturated on
existing 3D face datasets due to their small gallery sizes. Unlike 2D
photographs, 3D facial scans cannot be sourced from the web causing a
bottleneck in the development of deep 3D face recognition networks and
datasets. In this backdrop, we propose a method for generating a large corpus
of labeled 3D face identities and their multiple instances for training and a
protocol for merging the most challenging existing 3D datasets for testing. We
also propose the first deep CNN model designed specifically for 3D face
recognition and trained on 3.1 Million 3D facial scans of 100K identities. Our
test dataset comprises 1,853 identities with a single 3D scan in the gallery

outperforms state of the art face recognition by over 10%. We fine tune our
network on the gallery set to perform end-to-end large scale 3D face
recognition which further improves accuracy. Finally, we show the efficacy of
our method for the open world face recognition problem.

components to address these anomalies. Our study corroborates most of the
earlier observations and also sheds new light on the high and low temperature
dynamics. We find that unlike in standard glass former where high temperature
dynamics is dominated by two body correlation and low temperature by many body
correlations, in GCM both high and low temperature dynamics are dominated by
many body correlations. We also find that the many body entropy which is
usually positive at low temperatures and is associated with activated dynamics
is negative in GCM suggesting suppression of activation. Interestingly despite
suppression of activation the Adam-Gibbs (AG) relation which describes
activated dynamics holds in GCM, thus suggesting a non-activated contribution
in AG relation. We also find an overlap between the AG and mode coupling power
law regime leading to a power law behaviour of $S_c$. From our analysis of this
power law behaviour we predict that in GCM the high temperature dynamics will
disappear at dynamical transition temperature and below that there will be a
transition to the activated regime. Our study further reveals that the
activated regime in GCM is quite narrow.

new numerical scheme for a long term calculation utilizing the concept of
symplectic integrator. With our new scheme, we first investigate the non-linear
development of the secular GI in a disk without a pressure gradient in the
initial state. We find that the surface density of dust increases by more than
a factor of one hundred while that of gas does not increase even by a factor of
two, which results in the formation of dust-dominated rings. A line mass of the
dust ring tends to be very close to the critical line mass of a
self-gravitating isothermal filament. Our results indicate that the non-linear
growth of the secular GI provides a powerful mechanism to concentrate the dust.
We also find that the dust ring formed via the non-linear growth of the secular
GI migrates inward with a low velocity, which is driven by the self-gravity of
the ring. We give a semi-analytical expression for the inward migration speed
of the dusty ring.

discrepancies between different widely used transport codes, we compare 15 such
codes under controlled conditions of a system confined to a box with periodic
boundary, initialized with Fermi-Dirac distributions at saturation density and
temperatures of either 0 or 5 MeV. In such calculations, one is able to check
separately the different ingredients of a transport code. In this second
publication of the code evaluation project, we only consider the two-body
collision term, i.e. we perform cascade calculations. When the Pauli blocking
is artificially suppressed, the collision rates are found to be consistent for
most codes (to within $1\%$ or better) with analytical results, or completely
controlled results of a basic cascade code after eliminating the correlations
within the same pair of colliding particles. In calculations with active Pauli
blocking, the blocking probability was found to deviate from the expected
reference values. The reason is found in substantial phase-space fluctuations
and smearing tied to numerical algorithms and model assumptions in the
representation of phase space. This results in the reduction of the blocking
probability in most transport codes, so that the simulated system gradually
evolves away from the Fermi-Dirac towards a Boltzmann distribution. As a result
of this investigation, we are able to make judgements about the most effective
strategies in transport simulations for determining the collision probabilities
and the Pauli blocking. Investigation in a similar vein of other ingredients in
transport calculations, like the mean field propagation or the production of
nucleon resonances and mesons, will be discussed in the future publications.

gamma-ray light curves obtained from Fermi observations. The KVN radio core is
optically thick at least up to 86 GHz; there is indication that it might be
optically thin at higher frequencies. To first order, the radio light curves
decay exponentially over the time span covered by our observations, with decay
timescales of 411+/-85 days, 352+/-79 days, 310+/-57 days, and 283+/-55 days at
22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz, respectively. Assuming synchrotron cooling, a cooling
time of around one year is consistent with magnetic field strengths B~2microT
and electron Lorentz factors gamma~10,000. Taking into account that our formal
measurement errors include intrinsic variability and thus over-estimate the
statistical uncertainties, we find that the decay timescale tau scales with
frequency nu like tau~nu^{-0.2}. This relation is much shallower than the one
expected from opacity effects (core shift), but in agreement with the (sub-)mm
radio core being a standing recollimation shock. We do not find convincing
radio flux counterparts to the gamma$ray outbursts. The spectral evolution is
consistent with the `generalized shock model' of Valtaoja et al. (1992). A
temporary increase in the core opacity and the emergence of a knot around the
time of the second gamma-ray event indicate that this gamma-ray outburst might
be an `orphan' flare powered by the `ring of fire' mechanism.

instigated wide research interest. However, it is still an ill-posed problem
and most methods rely on prior models hence undermining the accuracy of the
recovered 3D faces. In this paper, we exploit the Epipolar Plane Images (EPI)
obtained from light field cameras and learn CNN models that recover horizontal
and vertical 3D facial curves from the respective horizontal and vertical EPIs.
Our 3D face reconstruction network (FaceLFnet) comprises a densely connected
architecture to learn accurate 3D facial curves from low resolution EPIs. To
train the proposed FaceLFnets from scratch, we synthesize photo-realistic light
field images from 3D facial scans. The curve by curve 3D face estimation
approach allows the networks to learn from only 14K images of 80 identities,
which still comprises over 11 Million EPIs/curves. The estimated facial curves
are merged into a single pointcloud to which a surface is fitted to get the
final 3D face. Our method is model-free, requires only a few training samples
to learn FaceLFnet and can reconstruct 3D faces with high accuracy from single
light field images under varying poses, expressions and lighting conditions.
Comparison on the BU-3DFE and BU-4DFE datasets show that our method reduces
reconstruction errors by over 20% compared to recent state of the art.

Decomposition of pairwise ranking data with multiple workers. The principle
exhibits two scenarios of active sampling: Fisher information maximization that
leads to unsupervised sampling based on a sequential maximization of graph
algebraic connectivity without considering labels; and Bayesian information
maximization that selects samples with the largest information gain from prior
to posterior, which gives a supervised sampling involving the labels collected.
Experiments show that the proposed methods boost the sampling efficiency as

the current solar convection simulations might be over-estimated. The
newly-revealed effects of the prevailing small-scale magnetic field within the
convection zone may offer possible solutions to this problem. The small-scale
magnetic fields can reduce the convective amplitude of small-scale motions
through the Lorentz-force feedback, which concurrently inhibits the turbulent
mixing of entropy between upflows and downflows. As a result, the effective
Prandtl number may exceed unity inside the solar convection zone. In this
paper, we propose and numerically confirm a possible suppression mechanism of
convective velocity in the effectively high-Prandtl number regime. If the
effective horizontal thermal diffusivity decreases (the Prandtl number
accordingly increases), the subadiabatic layer which is formed near the base of
the convection zone by continuous depositions of low entropy transported by
adiabatically downflowing plumes is enhanced and extended. The global
convective amplitude in the high-Prandtl thermal convection is thus reduced
especially in the lower part of the convection zone via the change in the mean
entropy profile which becomes more subadiabatic near the base and less
superadiabatic in the bulk.

implemented in the finite field domain, and the one-shot precoding for the MISO

in the same near-optimal DoF performance, we show that this leads to
significant performance improvement at finite SNR. Finally, we extend our

directly on the image, and is thus simple and small. We introduce a novel
normalization technique, called Context Normalization, which allows us to
process each data point separately while imbuing it with global information,
and also makes the network invariant to the order of the correspondences. Our

able to drastically improve the state of the art with little training data.

Because light-curve parameters of SNe Ia vary with different cosmological

cosmological parameters simultaneously employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method. Therefore, the results on the amount of deviation from isotropy of the
dark energy equation of state ($\delta$), and the level of anisotropy of the
large-scale geometry ($\Sigma_0$) at present, are totally model-independent.
The constraints on the skewness and cosmic shear are $-0.101<\delta<0.071$ and
$-0.007<\Sigma_0<0.008$. This result is consistent with a standard isotropic
universe ($\delta=\Sigma_0=0$). However, a moderate level of anisotropy in the
geometry of the Universe and the equation of state of dark energy, is allowed.
Besides, there is no obvious evidence for a preferred direction of anisotropic

the tail distinct lobes and central current sheet have been observed. It was

in plasma associated with that component appears to be equal to ion current in
the frontal part of magnetosphere and in the tail current sheet implying that
electrons are stationary in those regions while ions flow by. Obtained data

Roche lobe overflow/mass transfer process that governs close binary evolution

of the veil by studying the spin-up and spin-down processes of the O-type
components of WR+O binaries. We critically analyze the available observational
data of rotation speeds of the O-type components in WR+O binaries. By combining
a binary evolutionary code and a formalism that describes the effects of tides
in massive stars with an envelope in radiative equilibrium, we compute the
corresponding rotational velocities during the Roche lobe overflow of the
progenitor binaries. In all the studied WR+O binaries, we find that the O-type
stars were affected by accretion of matter during the RLOF of the progenitor.
This means that common envelope evolution which excludes any accretion onto the
secondary O-star, has not played an important role to explain the WR+O
binaries. Moreover, although it is very likely that the O-type star progenitors
were spun-up by the mass transfer, many ended the RLOF/mass transfer phase with
a rotational velocity that is significantly smaller than the critical rotation
speed. This may indicate that during the mass transfer phase there is a
spin-down process which is of the same order as, although significantly less
than that of the spin-up process. We propose a Spruit-Tayler type dynamo
spin-down suggested in the past to explain the rotation speeds of the mass
gainers in long-period Algols.

existence of a novel chiral nematic phase, termed screw-like, characterised by
the helical organization of the particle C$_2$ symmetry axes round the nematic
director with periodicity equal to the particle pitch. This phase forms at high
density and can follow a less dense uniform nematic phase, with relative
occurrence of the two phases depending on the helix morphology. Since these
numerical simulations were conducted under three-dimensional periodic boundary
conditions, two questions could remain open. Firstly, the real nature of the
lower density nematic phase, expected to be cholesteric. Secondly, the
influence that the latter, once allowed to form, may have on the existence and
stability of the screw-like nematic phase. To address these questions, we have
performed Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics numerical simulations of helical
particle systems confined between two parallel repulsive walls. We have found
that removal of the periodicity constraint along one direction allows a
relatively-long-pitch cholesteric phase to form, in lieu of the uniform nematic
phase, with helical axis perpendicular to the walls while the existence and
stability of the screw-like nematic phase are not appreciably affected by this
change of boundary conditions.

species depends on a captive breeding and reintroduction program. The model is
applied to the case of the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), an
endangered species in North America reliant on captive breeding for survival.
The timing of reintroduction is an important concern in these programs as there
is a tradeoff between the duration (and therefore the cost) of the captive
breeding program and the period the population spends in recovery and in the
wild. In this paper, we develop a stylized bioeconomic model to determine the
optimal reintroduction time, in which the objective is to minimize the cost of
reintroduction while providing a viably-sized population in the wild. Our
control variable is the timing of reintroduction, which departs from a large
body of work in bioeconomics that focuses on adjustable controls that directly
affect the target population. Generally, we find it is optimal to reintroduce
ferrets early in a reintroduction program, although this result is contingent
on species interactions and provisioning services.

microstructure. By fitting a model to the dMRI signal it is possible to derive
various quantitative features. Several of the most popular dMRI signal models
are expansions in an appropriately chosen basis, where the coefficients are
determined using some variation of least-squares. However, such approaches lack
any notion of uncertainty, which could be valuable in e.g. group analyses. In
this work, we use a probabilistic interpretation of linear least-squares
methods to recast popular dMRI models as Bayesian ones. This makes it possible
to quantify the uncertainty of any derived quantity. In particular, for
quantities that are affine functions of the coefficients, the posterior
distribution can be expressed in closed-form. We simulated measurements from
single- and double-tensor models where the correct values of several quantities
are known, to validate that the theoretically derived quantiles agree with
those observed empirically. We included results from residual bootstrap for
comparison and found good agreement. The validation employed several different
models: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Mean Apparent Propagator MRI (MAP-MRI)
and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD). We also used in vivo data to
visualize maps of quantitative features and corresponding uncertainties, and to
show how our approach can be used in a group analysis to downweight subjects
with high uncertainty. In summary, we convert successful linear models for dMRI
signal estimation to probabilistic models, capable of accurate uncertainty
quantification.

where an appropriate doping of the multiplication layer (p+) leads to high
enough electric fields for impact ionization. Gain factors of few tens in
charge significantly improve the resolution of timing measurements,
particularly for thin detectors, where the timing performance was shown to be
limited by Landau fluctuations. The main obstacle for their operation is the
decrease of gain with irradiation, attributed to effective acceptor removal in
the gain layer. Sets of thin sensors were produced by two different producers
on different substrates, with different gain layer doping profiles and
thicknesses (45, 50 and 80 um). Their performance in terms of gain/collected
charge and leakage current was compared before and after irradiation with
neutrons and pions up to the equivalent fluences of 5e15 cm-2. Transient
Current Technique and charge collection measurements with LHC speed electronics
were employed to characterize the detectors. The thin LGAD sensors were shown
to perform much better than sensors of standard thickness (~300 um) and offer
larger charge collection with respect to detectors without gain layer for
fluences <2e15 cm-2. Larger initial gain prolongs the beneficial performance of
LGADs. Pions were found to be more damaging than neutrons at the same
equivalent fluence, while no significant difference was found between different
producers. At very high fluences and bias voltages the gain appears due to deep
acceptors in the bulk, hence also in thin standard detectors.

and documents as bags of words. Text---a document or a query---is represented
by a bag of its words that ignores grammar and word order, but retains word
frequency counts. When presented with a search query, the engine then ranks
documents according to their relevance scores by computing, among other things,
the matching degrees between query and document terms. While term-based
approaches are intuitive and effective in practice, they are based on the
hypothesis that documents that exactly contain the query terms are highly
relevant regardless of query semantics. Inversely, term-based approaches assume
documents that do not contain query terms as irrelevant. However, it is known
that a high matching degree at the term level does not necessarily mean high
relevance and, vice versa, documents that match null query terms may still be
relevant. Consequently, there exists a vocabulary gap between queries and
documents that occurs when both use different words to describe the same
concepts. It is the alleviation of the effect brought forward by this
vocabulary gap that is the topic of this dissertation. More specifically, we
propose (1) methods to formulate an effective query from complex textual
structures and (2) latent vector space models that circumvent the vocabulary
gap in information retrieval.

SNR radio evolution in denser, nonuniform circumstellar environment, modified
by the progenitor star wind. These simulations start with the mass of the

lower shock speed. The magnetic field is understandably seen as very important

to learn on the manifold of real data. Compared with the classic GAN that {\em
globally} parameterizes a manifold, the Localized GAN (LGAN) uses local
coordinate charts to parameterize distinct local geometry of how data points
can transform at different locations on the manifold. Specifically, around each
point there exists a {\em local} generator that can produce data following
diverse patterns of transformations on the manifold. The locality nature of
LGAN enables local generators to adapt to and directly access the local
geometry without need to invert the generator in a global GAN. Furthermore, it
can prevent the manifold from being locally collapsed to a dimensionally
deficient tangent subspace by imposing an orthonormality prior between
tangents. This provides a geometric approach to alleviating mode collapse at
least locally on the manifold by imposing independence between data
transformations in different tangent directions. We will also demonstrate the
LGAN can be applied to train a robust classifier that prefers locally
consistent classification decisions on the manifold, and the resultant
regularizer is closely related with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Our
experiments show that the proposed LGANs can not only produce diverse image
transformations, but also deliver superior classification performances.

attracted considerable attention since it could be evidence of physics beyond
the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model. However, an accurate and robust calibration of
the mass-observable relation for clusters is necessary for the comparison,
which has been proven difficult to obtain so far. Here, we present new
contraints on the mass-pressure relation by combining tSZ and CMB lensing
measurements about optically-selected clusters. Consequently, our galaxy
cluster sample is independent from the data employed to derive cosmological
constrains. We estimate an average hydrostatic mass bias of $b = 0.26 \pm
0.07$, with no significant mass nor redshift evolution. This value greatly
reduces the tension between the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and the observed
abundance of tSZ clusters while being in agreement with recent estimations from
tSZ clustering. On the other hand, our value for $b$ is higher than the
predictions from hydro-dynamical simulations. This suggests the existence of
mechanisms driving large departures from hydrostatic equilibrium and that are
not included in state-of-the-art simulations, and/or unaccounted systematic

the rest-frame distribution effects, we propose to use a method based directly
on the coordinate representation. We treat matrix elements $M(z_3,p_3)$ as
distributions ${\cal M} (\nu, z_3^2)$ depending on the Ioffe-time $\nu = p_3
z_3$ and the distance parameter $z_3^2$. The rest-frame spatial distribution is
given by ${\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$. Using the reduced Ioffe function ${\mathfrak M}
(\nu, z_3^2) \equiv {\cal M} (\nu, z_3^2)/ {\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$ we divide out
the rest frame effects,including the notorious link renormalization factors.
The $\nu$-dependence remains intact and determines the shape of PDFs in the
small $z_3$ region. The residual $z_3^2$ dependence of the ${\mathfrak M} (\nu,
z_3^2)$ is governed by perturbative evolution. The Fourier transform of ${\cal
M} (\nu, z_3^2)$ produces pseudo-PDFs ${\cal P}(x, z_3^2)$ that generalize the
light-front PDFs onto spacelike intervals. On the basis of these findings we
propose a new method for extraction of PDFs from lattice calculations.

model for the description of ionic transport in ion channels. It is observed
that an ion channel exhibits voltage-dependent switching between open and
closed states. Different conductance states of a channel imply that the ssPNP
equations probably have multiple solutions with different level of currents. We
propose numerical approaches to study multiple solutions to the ssPNP equations
with multiple ionic species. To find complete current-voltage (I-V ) and
current-concentration (I-C) curves, we reformulate the ssPNP equations into
four different boundary value problems (BVPs). Numerical continuation
approaches are developed to provide good initial guesses for iteratively
solving algebraic equations resulting from discretization. Numerical
continuations on V , I, and boundary concentrations result in S-shaped and
double S-shaped (I-V and I-C) curves for the ssPNP equations with multiple
species of ions. There are five solutions to the ssPNP equations with five
ionic species, when an applied voltage is given in certain intervals.
Remarkably, the current through ion channels responds hysteretically to varying
applied voltages and boundary concentrations, showing a memory effect. In
addition, we propose a useful computational approach to locate turning points
of an I-V curve. With obtained locations, we are able to determine critical
threshold values for hysteresis to occur and the interval for V in which the
ssPNP equations have multiple solutions. Our numerical results indicate that
the developed numerical approaches have a promising potential in studying
hysteretic conductance states of ion channels.

members of open clusters: among them an exoplanet system around Pr 0211 in the
cluster M44 which consists of at least two planets with the outer planet moving
on a highly eccentric orbit at 5.5 AU. One hypothesis is that a close fly-by of
a neighbouring star was responsible for the eccentric orbit. We test this
hypothesis. First we determine the type of fly-by that would lead to the
observed parameters and then use this result to determine the history of such
fly-bys in simulations of the early dynamics in an M44-like environment. We
find that although very close fly-bys are required to obtain the observed
properties of Pr 0211c, such fly-bys are relatively common due to the high
stellar density and longevity of the cluster. Such close fly-bys are most
frequent during the first 1-2 Myr after cluster formation, corresponding to a
cluster age $\leq$ 3 Myr. During the first 2 to 3 Myr about 6.5% of stars
actually experience a fly-by that would lead to such a small system-size as
observed for Pr0211 or even smaller. It is unclear whether planets generally
form on such short timescales. However, afterwards the close fly-by rate is
still 0.2-0.5 Myr$^{-1}$, which means extrapolating this to the age of M44
12%-20% of stars would experience such close fly-bys over this timespan. Our
simulations show that the fly-by scenario is a realistic option for the
formation of eccentricity orbits of the planets in M44. The occurrence of such
events is relatively high leading to the expectation that similar systems are
likely common in open clusters in general.

further constraining of stellar structure and evolutionary models can be

NSMC constitutes an efficient and powerful method, in replacement to standard
Markov chain Monte Carlo, very suitable for high-dimensional and multimodal

fitting and mode identification of individual oscillation modes in stars (known
as peak-bagging). DIAMONDS is able to provide robust results for statistical
inferences involving tens of individual oscillation modes, while at the same
time preserving a considerable computational efficiency for identifying the
solution. In the tutorial, I will present the fitting of the stellar background

simultaneously optimise parameters of representation learning auto-encoders and

of tasks, such as facial emotion recognition and face parsing, and most
existing approaches generally treat these tasks independently, which limits
their deployment in real scenarios. In this paper we propose an integrated Face
Analytics Network (iFAN), which is able to perform multiple tasks jointly for
face analytics with a novel carefully designed network architecture to fully
facilitate the informative interaction among different tasks. The proposed
integrated network explicitly models the interactions between tasks so that the
correlations between tasks can be fully exploited for performance boost. In
addition, to solve the bottleneck of the absence of datasets with comprehensive
training data for various tasks, we propose a novel cross-dataset hybrid
training strategy. It allows ""plug-in and play"" of multiple datasets annotated
for different tasks without the requirement of a fully labeled common dataset
for all the tasks. We experimentally show that the proposed iFAN achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple face analytics tasks using a single
integrated model. Specifically, iFAN achieves an overall F-score of 91.15% on
the Helen dataset for face parsing, a normalized mean error of 5.81% on the
MTFL dataset for facial landmark localization and an accuracy of 45.73% on the

limitations of scale in existing works, our proposed algorithms allow every
mobile sensing agent to choose a different support set and dynamically switch
to another during execution for encapsulating its own data into a local summary
that, perhaps surprisingly, can still be assimilated with the other agents'
local summaries (i.e., based on their current choices of support sets) into a
globally consistent summary to be used for predicting the phenomenon. To
achieve this, we propose a novel transfer learning mechanism for a team of
agents capable of sharing and transferring information encapsulated in a
summary based on a support set to that utilizing a different support set with
some loss that can be theoretically bounded and analyzed. To alleviate the
issue of information loss accumulating over multiple instances of transfer
learning, we propose a new information sharing mechanism to be incorporated
into our algorithms in order to achieve memory-efficient lazy transfer
learning. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets show that our algorithms

between twisted closed magnetic loops (i.e., magnetic flux ropes) and open
magnetic field lines. The identification of the pre-existing flux rope, and the
relationship between the twist contained in the rope and the number of turns
the jet experiences, are then vital in understanding the jet-triggering
mechanism. In this paper, we will perform a detailed analysis of imaging,
spectral and magnetic field observations of four homologous jets, among which
the fourth one releases a twist angle of 2.6$\pi$. Non-linear force free field
extrapolation of the photospheric vector magnetic field before the jet eruption
presents a magnetic configuration with a null point between twisted and open
fields - a configuration highly in favor of the eruption of solar jets. The
fact that the jet rotates in the opposite sense of handness to the twist
contained in the pre-eruption photospheric magnetic field, confirms the
unwinding of the twist by the jet's rotational motion. Temporal relationship
between jets' occurrence and the total negative flux at their source region,
together with the enhanced magnetic submergence term of the photospheric
Poynting flux, shows that these jets are highly associated with local magnetic
flux cancellation.

errors, including fast and accurate online robot-error detection and
correction. Analysis of brain signals from a human interacting with a robot may
help identifying robot errors, but accuracies of such analyses have still
substantial space for improvement. In this paper we evaluate whether a novel
framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could
improve the accuracy of decoding robot errors from the EEG of a human observer,
both during an object grasping and a pouring task. We show that deep ConvNets
reached significantly higher accuracies than both regularized Linear
Discriminant Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP)
combined with rLDA, both widely used EEG classifiers. Deep ConvNets reached
mean accuracies of 75% +/- 9 %, rLDA 65% +/- 10% and FB-CSP + rLDA 63% +/- 6%
for decoding of erroneous vs. correct trials. Visualization of the time-domain
EEG features learned by the ConvNets to decode errors revealed spatiotemporal
patterns that reflected differences between the two experimental paradigms.
Across subjects, ConvNet decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with
those obtained with rLDA, but not CSP, indicating that in the present context
ConvNets behaved more 'rLDA-like' (but consistently better), while in a
previous decoding study with another task but the same ConvNet architecture, it
was found to behave more 'CSP-like'. Our findings thus provide further support
for the assumption that deep ConvNets are a versatile addition to the existing
toolbox of EEG decoding techniques, and we discuss steps how ConvNet EEG
decoding performance could be further optimized.

population-level estimates of health indicators. Survey results tend to be
biased under selective non-participation. One approach to bias reduction is to
collect information about non-participants by contacting them again and asking
them to fill in a questionnaire. This information is called re-contact data,
and it allows to adjust the estimates for non-participation.
  Methods: We analyse data from the FINRISK 2012 survey, where re-contact data
were collected. We assume that the respondents of the re-contact survey are
similar to the remaining non-participants with respect to the health given
their available background information. Validity of this assumption is
evaluated based on the hospitalization data obtained through record linkage of
survey data to the administrative registers. Using this assumption and multiple
imputation, we estimate the prevalences of daily smoking and heavy alcohol
consumption and compare them to estimates obtained with a commonly used
assumption that the participants represent the entire target group.
  Results: This approach produces higher prevalence estimates than what is
estimated from participants only. Among men, smoking prevalence estimate was
28.5% (23.2% for participants), heavy alcohol consumption prevalence was 9.4%
(6.8% for participants). Among women, smoking prevalence was 19.0% (16.5% for
participants) and heavy alcohol consumption 4.8% (3.0% for participants).
Conclusion: Utilization of re-contact data is a useful method to adjust for
non-participation bias on population estimates in epidemiological surveys.

on wavelength: amplitudes with longer bandpass filters show larger values. This
indicates that the light source of early superhumps is generated at the outer
region of the vertically-extended accretion disk. On the other hand, amplitudes
of ordinary superhumps are likely to be independent of wavelength. This implies
that the superhump light source is geometrically thin. We also examined color

their native operating conditions to establish the structure-function

considerable challenge for both electron-based and x-ray-based imaging
techniques. However, the advent of Bragg coherent x-ray diffractive imaging
(BCDI) has made possible the 3D imaging of multiple dislocations in
nanoparticles ranging in size from 100 nm to1000 nm. While the imaging process
succeeds in many cases, nuances in identifying the dislocations has left manual

but they can be inaccurate and are computationally inefficient. Here we
demonstrate a derivative-free method that is both more accurate and more

be controlled by the bottom ferromagnet because of the nonlocal character of
the SOT in this system. As a consequence the SOT is anisotropic, i.e., its

the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the top layer is anisotropic as
well, i.e., the spin-spiral wavelength of spin-spirals in the top layer depends
on their in-plane propagation direction. This effect suggests that DMI can be
tuned easily in magnetic trilayers via the magnetization direction of the
bottom layer. In order to understand the influence of the bottom ferromagnet on
the SOTs and the DMI of the top ferromagnet we study these effects in Co/Cu

  Semantically Guided Generative Adversarial Network",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contemporary benchmark methods for image inpainting are based on deep
generative models and specifically leverage adversarial loss for yielding
realistic reconstructions. However, these models cannot be directly applied on
image/video sequences because of an intrinsic drawback- the reconstructions
might be independently realistic, but, when visualized as a sequence, often
lacks fidelity to the original uncorrupted sequence. The fundamental reason is
that these methods try to find the best matching latent space representation
near to natural image manifold without any explicit distance based loss. In
this paper, we present a semantically conditioned Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) for sequence inpainting. The conditional information constrains
the GAN to map a latent representation to a point in image manifold respecting
the underlying pose and semantics of the scene. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work which simultaneously addresses consistency and
correctness of generative model based inpainting. We show that our generative
model learns to disentangle pose and appearance information; this independence
is exploited by our model to generate highly consistent reconstructions. The
conditional information also aids the generator network in GAN to produce
sharper images compared to the original GAN formulation. This helps in
achieving more appealing inpainting performance. Though generic, our algorithm
was targeted for inpainting on faces. When applied on CelebA and Youtube Faces
datasets, the proposed method results in a significant improvement over the
current benchmark, both in terms of quantitative evaluation (Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio) and human visual scoring over diversified combinations of

shortcuts taken in software development activities to achieve near term goals.
In this study, we explore a new context of technical debt that relates to
database normalization design decisions. We posit that ill normalized databases
can have long term ramifications on data quality, performance degradation and
maintainability costs over time, just like debts accumulate interest.
Conversely, conventional database approaches would suggest normalizing weakly
normalized tables, this can be a costly process in terms of effort and
expertise it requires for large software systems. As studies have shown that
the fourth normal form is often regarded as the ideal form in database design,
we claim that database normalization debts are likely to be incurred for tables
below this form. We refer to normalization debt item as any table in the
database below the fourth normal form.
  We propose a framework for identifying normalization debt. Our framework
makes use of association rule mining to discover functional dependencies
between attributes in a table, which will help determine the current normal
form of that table and identify debt tables. To manage such debts, we propose a
trade off analysis method to prioritize tables that are candidate for
normalization. The trade off is between the rework cost and the debt effect on
the quality of the system as the metaphoric interest. To evaluate our method,
we use a case study from Microsoft, AdventureWorks. The results show that our
method can reduce the cost and effort of normalization, while improving the
database design.

observation of new SU(2)_{CS} and SU(2N_F) symmetries upon artificial
truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator at zero temperature and
at high temperature without any truncation. These symmetries are larger than
the chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian and contain chiral symmetries
SU(N_F)_L \times SU(N_F)_R and U(1)_A as subgroups. In addition to the standard
chiral transformations the SU(2)_{CS} and SU(2N_F) transformations mix the
right- and left-handed components of the quark fields. It is a symmetry of the
confining chromo-electric interaction while the chromo-magnetic interaction
manifestly breaks it. Emergence of these symmetries upon truncation of the
near-zero modes of the Dirac operator at T=0 means that all effects of the
chromo-magnetic interaction are located exclusively in the near-zero modes,
while confining chromo-electric interaction is distributed among all modes.
Appearance of these symmetries at high T, where the temperature suppresses the
near-zero modes, has radical implications because these symmetries are
incompatible with the asymptotically free deconfined quarks at increasing
temperature. The elementary objects in the high-temperature phase of QCD should
be quarks bound by the pure chromo-electric field that is not accompanied by
the chromo-magnetic effects.

below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ is expected, but usually a neglected phenomenon. This
study is focused on such effect on the example of $\mathrm{U_{4}Ru_{7}Ge_{6}}$.
We propose the lattice distortion from the cubic space group to a lower
symmetry as a result of our DFT calculations. The strong spin-orbit coupling on
the U site plays the most essential role, that should lower the symmetry of the
system and give rise to the two different U sites (U1 and U2). We bring
convincing experimental evidence for this splitting resulting from our
polarized neutron diffraction experiment. Proper treatment of the flipping
ratios collected in the ordered state and in the paramagnetic state reveals
dramatically different magnetic moments on the U1 and U2 sites. We have reached
good agreement of the results from the MAXENT method and from direct fitting of
the data. The ratio of the orbital and spin component on the U2 site is lower
than for the free $\mathrm{U^{3+}}$ or $\mathrm{U^{4+}}$ ion and points to a
strong hybridization between the U $5f$ and Ru $4d$ wave functions. The same
ratio on the U1 site is unexpectedly low. This would mean that its orbital
component is almost quenched. We have observed the absence of a magnetic moment
on the Ru1 site, but a rather large induced moment on the Ru2 site. Very
similar results were obtained also in the paramagnetic state in the regime
induced by the magnetic field. It points to the intimate coupling of the
magnetic ordering and structural distortion as it is possible to split the U
site in to two different polarizing paramagnetic U moments above
$T_{\mathrm{C}}$ by a strong magnetic field. We propose that the difference
between the magnetic moment on the U sites is caused by the change of local
point symmetry of the sites that is tightly bound to the role of the strong
spin-orbit interaction.

metric-based regularization aims at domain-invariant latent feature

activation distributions. The proposed metric results from modifying an
integral probability metric such that it becomes less translation-sensitive on
a polynomial function space. The metric has an intuitive interpretation in the
dual space as the sum of differences of higher order central moments of the
corresponding activation distributions. Under appropriate assumptions on the
input distributions, error minimization is proven for the continuous case. As
demonstrated by an analysis of standard benchmark experiments for sentiment
analysis, object recognition and digit recognition, the outlined approach is
robust regarding parameter changes and achieves higher classification
accuracies than comparable approaches. The source code is available at

another 2 months back to pre-flare levels. The long-term trend was superseded
by short but very strong flares, resulting in a peak flux that was a factor 50
above pre-flare levels in the $\gamma$-ray domain and almost a factor 100 above
pre-flare levels in the optical domain. In this paper we explain the long-term
evolution of the outburst by the ablation of a gas cloud penetrating the

the particle injection until the center of the cloud is reached, after which
the injected number of particles decreases again. With reasonable cloud

which naturally reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic labelled
transition systems to checking bisimilarity of standard (non-deterministic)
labelled transition systems. This reduction can be easily implemented in the
framework of pPDA, allowing to use known results for standard
(non-probabilistic) PDA and their subclasses. A direct use of the reduction
incurs an exponential increase of complexity, which does not matter in deriving
decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA due to the non-elementary complexity of
the problem. In the cases of probabilistic one-counter automata (pOCA), of
probabilistic visibly pushdown automata (pvPDA), and of probabilistic basic
process algebras (i.e., single-state pPDA) we show that an implicit use of the
reduction can avoid the complexity increase; we thus get PSPACE, EXPTIME, and
2-EXPTIME upper bounds, respectively, like for the respective non-probabilistic
versions. The bisimilarity problems for OCA and vPDA are known to have matching
lower bounds (thus being PSPACE-complete and EXPTIME-complete, respectively);
we show that these lower bounds also hold for fully probabilistic versions that

  into account a power-law distribution of coalescence times","A&A 610, A58 (2018)","10.1051/0004-6361/201731875",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gravitational wave interferometers have proved the existence of a new class
of binary black holes (BBHs) weighting tens of solar masses and they have
provided the first reliable measurement of the rate of coalescing black holes
(BHs) in the local universe. On another side, long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
detected with gamma-ray satellites are believed to be associated with the birth
of stellar mass BHs, providing a measure of the rate of these events across the
history of the universe, thanks to the measure of their cosmological redshift.
These two types of sources, which are subject to different detection biases and
involve BHs born in different environments with potentially different
characteristics, provide complementary information on the birth rate of stellar
BHs. We compare here the birth rates of BHs found in BBH mergers and in long
GRBs.
  We construct a simple model which makes reasonable assumptions on the history
of GRB formation, and which takes into account some major uncertainties, like
the beaming angle of GRBs or the delay between the formation of BBHs and their
coalescence. We use this model to evaluate the ratio of the number of stellar
mass BHs formed in BBH mergers to those formed in GRBs. We find that in our
reference model the birth rate of stellar BHs in BBH mergers represents from
few percent to 100% of the rate of long GRBs and that comparable birth rates
are favored by models with moderate beaming angles. We briefly discuss this
result in view of our understanding of the progenitors of GRBs and BBH mergers,
and we emphasize that this ratio, which will be better constrained in the
coming years, can be directly compared with the prediction of stellar evolution
models if a single model is used to produce GRBs and of BBH mergers with the
same assumptions.

of central importance for the study of the electric properties of low
dimensional materials and interfaces, of superconducting thin films and of
electronic devices. Current distribution is usually derived from the
measurement of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field above the
surface of the sample, followed by numerical inversion of the Biot-Savart law.
The inversion is commonly obtained by deriving the current stream function $g$,
which is then differentiated in order to obtain the current distribution.
However, this two-step procedure requires filtering at each step and, as a
result, oversmoothes the solution. To avoid this oversmoothing we develop a
direct procedure for inversion of the magnetic field that avoids use of the
stream function. This approach provides enhanced accuracy of current
reconstruction over a wide range of noise levels. We further introduce a
reflection procedure that allows for the reconstruction of currents that cross
the boundaries of the measurement window. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated by several numerical examples.

  Methods: With SUPRA we propose an open-source pipeline for fully Software

wavelength range. The recently installed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) is capable of observing the Sun in that wavelength range with an
unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. To interpret solar
observations with ALMA the first important step is to compare ALMA maps with
simultaneous images of the Sun recorded in other spectral ranges. First we
identify different structures in the solar atmosphere seen in the optical, IR
and EUV parts of the spectrum (quiet Sun (QS), active regions (AR), prominences
on the disc, magnetic inversion lines (IL), coronal holes (CH) and coronal
bright points (CBPs)) in a full disc solar ALMA image. The second aim is to
measure the intensities (brightness temperatures) of those structures and
compare them with the corresponding QS level. A full disc solar image at 1.21
mm obtained on December 18, 2015 during a CSV-EOC campaign with ALMA is
calibrated and compared with full disc solar images from the same day in
H\alpha, in He I 1083 nm core, and with SDO images (AIA at 170 nm, 30.4 nm,
21.1 nm, 19.3 nm, and 17.1 nm and HMI magnetogram). The brightness temperatures
of various structures are determined by averaging over corresponding regions of
interest in the ALMA image. Positions of the QS, ARs, prominences on the disc,
ILs, CHs and CBPs are identified in the ALMA image. At 1.21 mm ARs appear as
bright areas (but sunspots are dark), while prominences on the disc and CHs are
not discernible from the QS background, although having slightly less intensity
than surrounding QS regions. ILs appear as large, elongated dark structures and
CBPs correspond to ALMA bright points. These results are in general agreement
with sparse earlier measurements at similar wavelengths. The identification of
CBPs represents the most important new result.

accurate synthetic turbulence profiles via statistical methods is of interest.
Such a method is proposed where the two-point covariance function of the
desired turbulence is used to construct a multi-variate normal distribution.
Sampling from this distribution produces random fields which are both
qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the input turbulence data set. The

However, the accuracy still requires improvement and very little work is
focusing on the robustness and adaptability of the identification system. We
propose MindID, an EEG-based biometric identification approach, achieves higher
accuracy and better characteristics. At first, the EEG data patterns are
analyzed and the results show that the Delta pattern contains the most
distinctive information for user identification. Then the decomposed Delta
pattern is fed into an attention-based Encoder-Decoder RNNs (Recurrent Neural
Networks) structure which assigns various attention weights to different EEG
channels based on the importance of channels. The discriminative
representations learned from the attention-based RNN are used to recognize the
user identification through a boosting classifier. The proposed approach is
evaluated over 3 datasets (two local and one public). One local dataset (EID-M)
is used for performance assessment and the result illustrates that our model
achieves an accuracy of 0.982 which outperforms the baselines and the
state-of-the-art. Another local dataset (EID-S) and a public dataset (EEG-S)

semantic information about a surgical procedure that is usually expressed by
the following elements: an action verb, surgical instrument, and operated

crucial to recognize it. For all the studied surgeries, a combination of two
elements, always including the structure, proved sufficient to confidently
recognize the activities. We also found that in the presence of noise,
combining the information about the instrument, structure, and historical

  Management, Oct 2017, Saarebr{\""u}cke, Germany",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  -Complex manufacturing systems are subject to high levels of variability that
decrease productivity, increase cycle times and severely impact the systems
tractability. As accurate modelling of the sources of variability is a
cornerstone to intelligent decision making, we investigate the consequences of
the assumption of independent and identically distributed variables that is
often made when modelling sources of variability such as down-times, arrivals,
or process-times. We first explain the experiment setting that allows, through
simulations and statistical tests, to measure the variability potential stored
in a specific sequence of data. We show from industrial data that dependent
behaviors might actually be the rule with potentially considerable consequences
in terms of cycle time. As complex industries require strong levers to allow
their tractability, this work underlines the need for a richer and more
accurate modelling of real systems. Keywords-variability; cycle time; dependent
events; simulation; complex manufacturing; industry 4.0 I. Accurate modelling
of variability and the independence assumption Industry 4.0 is said to be the
next industrial revolution. The proper use of real-time information in complex
manufacturing systems is expected to allow more customization of products in
highly flexible production factories. Semiconductor High Mix Low Volume (HMLV)
manufacturing facilities (called fabs) are one example of candidates for this
transition towards ""smart industries"". However, because of the high levels of
variability, the environment of a HMLV fab is highly stochastic and difficult
to manage. The uncontrolled variability limits the predictability of the system
and thus the ability to meet delivery requirements in terms of volumes, cycle
times and due dates. Typically, the HMLV STMicroelectronics Crolles 300 fab
regularly experiences significant mix changes that result in unanticipated
bottlenecks, leading to firefighting to meet commitment to customers. The
overarching goal of our strategy is to improve the forecasting of future
occurrences of bottlenecks and cycle time issues in order to anticipate them
through allocation of the correct attention and resources. Our current finite
capacity projection engine can effectively forecast bottlenecks, but it does
not include reliable cycle time estimates. In order to enhance our projections,
better forecast cycle time losses (queuing times), improve the tractability of
our system and reduce our cycle times, we now need accurate dynamic cycle time
predictions. As increased cycle-time is the main reason workflow variability is
studied (both by the scientific community and practitioners, see e.g. [1] and
[2]), what follows concentrates on cycle times. Moreover, the ""variability"" we
account for should be understood as the potential to create higher cycle times,
even though ""variability"" may be understood in a broader meaning. This choice
is made for the sake of clarity, but the methodology we propose and the
discussion we lead can be applied to any other measurable indicator. Sources of
variability have been intensely investigated in both the literature and the
industry, and tool down-times, arrivals variability as well as process-time
variability are recognized as the major sources of variability in that sense
that they create higher cycle times (see [3] for a review and discussion). As a
consequence, these factors are widely integrated into queuing formulas and
simulation models with the objective to better model the complex reality of
manufacturing facilities. One commonly accepted assumption in the development
of these models is that the variables (MTBF, MTTR, processing times, time
between arrivals, etc.) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
random variables. However, these assumptions might be the reason for models
inaccuracies as [4] points out in a literature review on queuing theory.
Several authors have studied the potential effects of dependencies, such as [5]
who studied the potential effects of dependencies between arrivals and
process-times or [6] who investigated dependent process times, [4] also gives
further references for studies on dependencies effects. In a previous work [3],
we pinpointed a few elements from industrial data that questioned the viability
of this assumption in complex manufacturing systems. Figure 1: Number of

within the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) dataset (using 12- and

aperture photometry and then by an alternative image analysis algorithm that
used active contours. The accuracy of the two methods was tested by comparing
the estimated fluxes for a sample of bubbles, made up of 126 H II regions and
43 planetary nebulae, which were identified by Anderson et al. The results of

  Detection",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present Symbolic Quick Error Detection (Symbolic QED), a structured
approach for logic bug detection and localization which can be used both during
pre-silicon design verification as well as post-silicon validation and debug.
This new methodology leverages prior work on Quick Error Detection (QED) which
has been demonstrated to drastically reduce the latency, in terms of the number
of clock cycles, of error detection following the activation of a logic (or
electrical) bug. QED works through software transformations, including
redundant execution and control flow checking, of the applied tests. Symbolic
QED combines these error-detecting QED transformations with bounded model
checking-based formal analysis to generate minimal-length bug activation traces
that detect and localize any logic bugs in the design. We demonstrate the
practicality and effectiveness of Symbolic QED using the OpenSPARC T2, a
500-million-transistor open-source multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) design, and
using ""difficult"" logic bug scenarios observed in various state-of-the-art
commercial multicore SoCs. Our results show that Symbolic QED: (i) is fully
automatic, unlike manual techniques in use today that can be extremely
time-consuming and expensive; (ii) requires only a few hours in contrast to
manual approaches that might take days (or even months) or formal techniques
that often take days or fail completely for large designs; and (iii) generates
counter-examples (for activating and detecting logic bugs) that are up to 6
orders of magnitude shorter than those produced by traditional techniques.
Significantly, this new approach does not require any additional hardware.

  The Review of Symbolic Logic",,"10.1017/S1755020319000297",,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Principia Logico-Metaphysica contains a foundational logical theory for
metaphysics, mathematics, and the sciences. It includes a canonical development
of Abstract Object Theory [AOT], a metaphysical theory (inspired by ideas of
Ernst Mally, formalized by Zalta) that distinguishes between ordinary and
abstract objects.
  This article reports on recent work in which AOT has been successfully
represented and partly automated in the proof assistant system Isabelle/HOL.
Initial experiments within this framework reveal a crucial but overlooked fact:
a deeply-rooted and known paradox is reintroduced in AOT when the logic of
complex terms is simply adjoined to AOT's specially-formulated comprehension
principle for relations. This result constitutes a new and important paradox,
given how much expressive and analytic power is contributed by having the two
kinds of complex terms in the system. Its discovery is the highlight of our
joint project and provides strong evidence for a new kind of scientific
practice in philosophy, namely, computational metaphysics.
  Our results were made technically possible by a suitable adaptation of
Benzm\""uller's metalogical approach to universal reasoning by semantically
embedding theories in classical higher-order logic. This approach enables one
to reuse state-of-the-art higher-order proof assistants, such as Isabelle/HOL,
for mechanizing and experimentally exploring challenging logics and theories
such as AOT. Our results also provide a fresh perspective on the question of
whether relational type theory or functional type theory better serves as a
foundation for logic and metaphysics.

access to the full spectrum of QCD. At zero momentum, these techniques are well
established and can cleanly isolate energy eigenstates of either positive or
negative parity. In order to compute the form factors of a single energy
eigenstate, we must perform a variational analysis at non-zero momentum. When
we do this with baryons, we run into issues with parity mixing in the Dirac
spinors, as boosted baryons are not eigenstates of parity. Due to this parity
mixing, care must be taken to ensure that the projected correlation functions
provided by the variational analysis correspond to the same states at zero
momentum. This can be achieved through the parity-expanded variational analysis
(PEVA) technique, a novel method developed at the University of Adelaide for
ensuring the successful and consistent isolation of boosted baryons. Utilising
this technique, we are able to compute the form factors of baryon excitations
without contamination from other states. We present world-first calculations of
excited state nucleon form factors using this new technique.

beyond the Standard Model. The joint detection of gravitational waves (GW) and
electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merging of a binary system of compact
objects like neutron stars (NS), can help constrain the geometry of extra
dimensions beyond our 3+1 spacetime ones. A theoretically well-motivated
possibility is that our observable Universe is a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface,
or brane, embedded in a higher 4+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$)
spacetime, in which gravity is the only force which propagates through the
infinite bulk space, while other forces are confined to the brane. In these
types of brane-world models, GW and EM signals between two points on the brane
would, in general, travel different paths. This would result in a time-lag
between the detection of GW and EM signals emitted simultaneously from the same
source. We consider the recent near-simultaneous detection of the GW event
GW170817 from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, and its EM counterpart, the short
gamma-ray burst GRB170817A detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and
the INTEGRAL Anti-Coincidence Shield spectrometer. Assuming the standard
$\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario and performing a likelihood
analysis which takes into account astrophysical uncertainties associated to the
measured time-lag, we set an upper limit of $\ell \lesssim 0.535\,$Mpc at
$68\%$ confidence level on the AdS$_5$ radius of curvature $\ell$. Although the
bound is not competitive with current Solar System constraints, it is the first
time that data from a multi-messenger GW-EM measurement is used to constrain
extra-dimensional models. Thus, our work provides a proof-of-principle for the
possibility of using multi-messenger astronomy for probing the geometry of our
space-time.

Osterwalder-Schrader data (OS-data) consisting of 1. a Hilbert space, 2. a
cyclic vacuum and 3. a Hamiltonian annihilating that vacuum. As the name
suggests, the motivation was via the OS reconstruction theorem which allows to
reconstruct the OS data from an OS measure satisfying (a subset of) the OS
axioms, in particular reflection positivity. The guiding principle was to map
the usual Wilsonian path integral renormalisation flow onto a flow of the
corresponding OS data.
  We showed that this induced flow on the OS data has an unwanted feature which
disqualifies the associated coarse grained Hamiltonians from being the
projections of a continuum Hamiltonian onto vectors in the coarse grained
Hilbert space. This motivated the definition of a direct Hamiltonian
renormalisation flow which follows the guiding principle but does not suffer
from the afore mentioned caveat.
  In order to test our proposal, we apply it to the only known completely
solvable model, namely the case of free scalar quantum fields. In this paper we
focus on the Klein Gordon field in two spacetime dimensions and illustrate the
difference between the path integral induced and direct Hamiltonian flow.
Generalisations to more general models in higher dimensions will be discussed
in our companion papers.

similar to those already detected, would increase to $\sim$ 10$^{3}$--10$^{5}$
per year. Within 0.4Gpc we find that around 10 of these events would be
localizable to within $\sim 10^{-1}$ deg$^2$. This is sufficient to make unique
associations or to rule out a direct association with the brightest galaxies in
optical surveys (at r-band magnitudes of 17 or above) or for deeper limits
(down to r-band magnitudes of 20) yield statistically significant associations.
The combination of angular resolution and event rate would benefit precision
testing of formation models, cosmic evolution and cosmological studies.

that accounts for an additional contribution to the electric current due to the
chiral magnetic effect (CME). This quantum phenomenon originates from an
asymmetry between left- and right-handed relativistic fermions in the presence
of a magnetic field and gives rise to a chiral dynamo. We show that the
magnetic field evolution proceeds in three stages: (1) a small-scale chiral
dynamo instability; (2) production of chiral magnetically driven turbulence and
excitation of a large-scale dynamo instability due to a new chiral effect
(alpha_mu effect); and (3) saturation of magnetic helicity and magnetic field
growth controlled by a conservation law for the total chirality. The
$\alpha_\mu$ effect becomes dominant at large fluid and magnetic Reynolds
numbers and is not related to kinetic helicity. The growth rate of the
large-scale magnetic field and its characteristic scale measured in the
numerical simulations agree well with theoretical predictions based on
mean-field theory. The previously discussed two-stage chiral magnetic scenario
did not include stage (2) during which the characteristic scale of magnetic
field variations can increase by many orders of magnitude. Based on the
findings from numerical simulations, the relevance of the CME and the chiral
effects revealed in the relativistic plasma of the early universe and of
proto-neutron stars are discussed.

use of tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) sensors for accurate, real-time, and

particular focus on gold due to its desirable optical and plasmonic properties.
Through the use of orthogonally-polarized transverse electric (TE) and
transverse magnetic (TM) resonance modes imposed by a boundary condition at the
cladding-metal interface of the optical fiber, polarization-dependent
resonances excited by the TFBG are easily decoupled. It was found that for
ultrathin thicknesses of gold films from CVD (~6-65 nm), the anisotropic
property of these films made it non-trivial to characterize their effective
optical properties such as the real component of the permittivity.
Nevertheless, the TFBG introduces a new sensing platform to the ALD and CVD
community for extremely sensitive in-situ process monitoring. We later also
demonstrate thin film growth at low (<10 cycle) numbers for the well-known
Al2O3 thermal ALD process, as well as the plasma-enhanced gold ALD process.

particles movement will not be depend on its velocity rather it will be decided
by constrained biased random walk of particles. In random walk every particles
movement based on two significant parameters, one is random process like toss

classical PSO. In our constrained biased random walking approach, we no longer
needed velocity term (Vi), rather we introduce a new parameter (K) which is a
probabilistic function. No global best particle (PGbest), local best particle
(PLbest), Constriction parameter (W) are required rather we use a new term

have been shown significantly better than basic PSO and sometime outperform

  This paper proposes a general methodology to address the challenges. We
decouple the NN applications from the target hardware by introducing a compiler
