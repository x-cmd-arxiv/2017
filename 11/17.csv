category based on the training instances from seen categories, in which the gap
between seen categories and unseen categories is generally bridged via
visual-semantic mapping between the low-level visual feature space and the
intermediate semantic space. However, the visual-semantic mapping learnt based
on seen categories may not generalize well to unseen categories because the
data distributions between seen categories and unseen categories are
considerably different, which is known as the projection domain shift problem
in ZSL. To address this domain shift issue, we propose a method named Adaptive
Embedding ZSL (AEZSL) to learn an adaptive visual-semantic mapping for each
unseen category based on the similarities between each unseen category and all
the seen categories. Then, we further make two extensions based on our AEZSL
method. Firstly, in order to utilize the unlabeled test instances from unseen
categories, we extend our AEZSL to a semi-supervised approach named AEZSL with
Label Refinement (AEZSL_LR), in which a progressive approach is developed to
update the visual classifiers and refine the predicted test labels
alternatively based on the similarities among test instances and among unseen
categories. Secondly, to avoid learning visual-semantic mapping for each unseen
category in the large-scale classification task, we extend our AEZSL to a deep
adaptive embedding model named Deep AEZSL (DAEZSL) sharing the similar idea
(i.e., visual-semantic mapping should be category-specific and related to the
semantic space) with AEZSL, which only needs to be trained once, but can be
applied to arbitrary number of unseen categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art results for
image classification on four benchmark datasets.

visible spectra. The major spectral features are fitted through the VUV to the
mid infrared to obtain positions, full-widths at half maximum (FWHM), and
integrated intensities. These are plotted against the position of the
$\pi$-$\pi^*$ electronic transitions peak. Unidentified or overlapping features
in the UV are identified by correlations with complementary infrared data. A
correlation between the optical gap and position of the $\pi$-$\pi^*$
electronic transitions peak is found. The latter is also correlated to the
position of the sp$^3$ carbon defect band at ~8 $\mu$m, the aromatic C=C
stretching mode position at ~6 $\mu$m, and the H/C ratio. Our study suggests
that carriers of the interstellar UV bump should exhibit infrared bands akin to

times as much flux as Earth from the Sun and its equilibrium ranges in
temperature between 269 K for an Earth-like albedo and 213 K for a Venus-like
albedo. Recent studies place it close to the inner edge of the conventional
habitable zone. An 80-day long light curve from K2 campaign C01 demonstrates
that Ross~128~b does not transit. Together with the All Sky Automated Survey
(ASAS) photometry and spectroscopic activity indices, the K2 photometry shows
that Ross 128 rotates slowly and has weak magnetic activity. In a habitability
context, this makes survival of its atmosphere against erosion more likely.
Ross 128 b is the second closest known exo-Earth, after Proxima Centauri b (1.3
parsec), and the closest temperate planet known around a quiet star. The 15 mas
planet-star angular separation at maximum elongation will be resolved by ELTs

In many situations, only a subset of all pairwise distances is available and it

paper, we address the problem of missing data in EDM through low-rank matrix
completion techniques. We exploit the fact that the rank of a EDM is at most
k+2 and does not depend on the number of points, which is, in general, much
bigger then k. We use a Singular Value Decomposition approach that considers
the rank of the matrix to be completed and computes, in each iteration, a
parameter that controls the convergence of the method. After performing a
number of computational experiments, we could observe that our proposal was
able to recover, with high precision, random EDMs with more than one thousand

method required a smaller number of iterations when compared to other

Rousseff, and from January/27/2016 to September/08/2016 which includes the
government transition from President Dilma Rousseff to President Michel Temer.
Minimum spanning trees from mutual information and linear correlation between
stocks returns were obtained and compared. Mutual information minimum spanning
trees present higher degree of robustness and evidence of power law tail in the
weighted degree distribution, indicating more risk in terms of volatility
transmission than it is expected by the analysis based on linear correlation.
In particular, a remarkable increase of stock returns nonlinear dependencies
indicates that the period including the government transition is more risky in
terms of volatility transmission network structure. Also, we found evidence of
network structure and stock performance relationship. Besides, those results
emphasize the usefulness of mutual information network analysis for
identification of Financial Markets features due to nonlinear dependencies.

can be due to disorder, which remarkably counteracts decoherence even when it

key of the varying spin-orbital orders appearing in titanates. Thus, titanates
are prototypical examples illustrating how a subtle interplay between several
lattice distortions commonly appearing in perovskites can produce orbital
orderings and insulating phases irrespective of proper Jahn-Teller motions.

group/cluster evolution, as galaxies experiencing dynamical friction sink to
the center of the group potential and merge into a single, giant elliptical
that dominates the rest of the members in both mass and luminosity. Most fossil
systems discovered lie within $z < 0.2$, which leads to the question: what were
these systems' progenitors? Such progenitors are expected to have imminent or
ongoing major merging near the brightest group galaxy (BGG) that, when
concluded, will meet the fossil criteria within the look back time. Since
strong gravitational lensing preferentially selects groups merging along the
line of sight, or systems with a high mass concentration like fossil systems,
we searched the CASSOWARY survey of strong lensing events with the goal of
determining if lensing systems have any predisposition to being fossil systems
or progenitors. We find that $\sim$13% of lensing groups are identified as
traditional fossils while only $\sim$3% of non-lensing control groups are. We
also find that $\sim$23% of lensing systems are traditional fossil progenitors

lensing systems are more likely to be fossil/pre-fossil systems than comparable

thereof in order to approximate the complex fluid-structure interactions. We
perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) using the volume-of-fluid method in
three dimensions, for a collection of drop sizes and impingement angles. The
high speed background air flow is coupled with the motion of the liquid in the
framework of oblique stagnation-point flow. Qualitative and quantitative
features are studied in both pre- and post-impact stages. One-to-one
comparisons are made with experimental data available from the investigations
of Sor et al. (Journal of Aircraft 52 (6), pp. 1838-1846, 2015), while the main
body of results is created using parameters relevant to flight conditions with
droplet sizes in the ranges from tens to several hundreds of microns, as
presented by Papadakis et al. (AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit
0565, pp. 1-40, 2004). Drop deformation, collision, coalescence and microdrop
ejection and dynamics, all typically neglected or empirically modelled, are
accurately accounted for. In particular, we identify new morphological features
in regimes below the splashing threshold in the modelled conditions. We then
expand on the variation in the number and distribution of ejected microdrops as
a function of the impacting drop size beyond this threshold. The presented
model of drop impact addresses key questions at a fundamental level, however
the conclusions of the study extend towards the advancement of understanding of
water dynamics on aircraft surfaces, which has important implications in terms
of compliance to aircraft safety regulations.

the appearance of an internal horizon as being negligible, because of the

applicable to a wide range of compressible multicomponent flows. Although many
highly efficient algorithms have been proposed for simulating each type of the
flows, the construction of a universal solver is known to be challenging.
Extreme cases, such as incompressible and highly compressible flows, or
inviscid and highly viscous flows, require different numerical treatments in
order to maintain the efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the method.
  Linearized block implicit (LBI) factored schemes are known to provide an
efficient way of solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations implicitly,
allowing us to avoid stability restrictions at low Mach number and high
viscosity. However, the methods' splitting error has been shown to grow and
dominate physical fluxes as the Mach number goes to zero. In this paper, a
splitting error reduction technique is proposed to solve the issue. A novel
finite element shock-capturing algorithm, proposed by Guermond and Popov, is
reformulated in terms of finite differences, extended to the stiffened gas
equation of state (SG EOS) and combined with the LBI factored scheme to
stabilize the method around flow discontinuities at high Mach numbers. A novel
stabilization term is proposed for low Mach number applications. The resulting
algorithm is shown to be efficient in both low and high Mach number regimes.
The algorithm is extended to the multicomponent case using an interface
capturing strategy with surface tension as a continuous surface force.
Numerical tests are presented to verify the performance and stability
properties for a wide range of flows.

approximation to the zone averaged values to reconstruct the right, middle, and
left interface values. The grid dependent linear weights of the WENO are
recovered by inverting a Vandermode-like linear system of equations with
spatially varying coefficients. A scheme for calculating the linear weights,
optimal weights, and smoothness indicator on a regularly- and

grid independent relation for evaluating the smoothness indicator is derived
from the basic definition. Finally, the procedures for the source term

Robust Lower Bound proposed by Sellke, Bayarri and Berger (2001), but we
incorporate a simple power of the sample size to make it adaptive to different
amounts of data.
  We present several illustrations from where it is apparent that the ARLB
closely approximates exact Bayes Factors. In particular, it has the same
asymptotics as posterior probabilities but avoiding the problems of ""Bayesian
Information Criterion"" (BIC) for small samples relative to the number of
parameters.
  We prove that the ARLB is consistent as the sample size grows, and that it is
information consistent (Berger and Pericchi, 2001) for the canonical Normal
case, but with methods that are keen to be generalized. So ARLB also avoids the
problems of certain conjugate priors as g-priors.
  In summary, this is a novel criterion easy to apply, as it only requires a
real p value, a sample size and parameter dimensionality. This method is
intended to aid the practitioners, who are increasingly aware of the lack of
reproducibility of traditional hypothesis testing ""findings"" but at the same
time, lack of concrete simple alternatives. Here is one.

multi-valued functions, proving that the Hausdorff dimension of the singular
set (including branch points) of such a function is at most $(n-2),$ where $n$
is the dimension of its domain. Almgren used this result in an essential way to
show that the same upper bound holds for the dimension of the singular set of
an area minimizing $n$-dimensional rectifiable current of arbitrary
codimension. In either case, the dimension bound is sharp. We develop estimates
to study the asymptotic behaviour of a multi-valued Dirichlet energy minimizer
on approach to its singular set. Our estimates imply that a Dirichlet energy
minimizer at ${\mathcal H}^{n-2}$ a.e. point of its singular set has a unique
set of homogeneous multi-valued cylindrical tangent functions (blow-ups) to
which the minimizer, modulo a set of single-valued harmonic functions, decays
exponentially fast upon rescaling. A corollary is that the singular set is
countably $(n-2)$-rectifiable. Our work is inspired by the work of L. Simon on
the analysis of singularities of minimal submanifolds in multiplicity 1

from Wickramasekera's prior work to overcome additional difficulties arising
from higher multiplicity and low regularity of the minimizers in the presence
of branch points. The results described here were announced in earlier work of

originate from nearby astrophysical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes

HighAltitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera-electron volt
gamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged
pulsars (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that
these pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated leptons, but the measured
tera-electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away
from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate
that the leptons emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the
origin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin.

plays a critical role in global biodiversity assessment, to the general (alpha-
or beta-diversity in Hill numbers) diversity area relationship (DAR). The
extension was motivated to remedy the limitation of traditional SAR that only
address one aspect of biodiversity scaling, i.e., species richness scaling over
space. The extension was made possible by the fact that all Hill numbers are in
units of species (referred to as the effective number of species or as species
equivalents), and I postulated that Hill numbers should follow the same or
similar pattern of SAR. I selected three DAR models, the traditional power law
(PL), PLEC (PL with exponential cutoff) and PLIEC (PL with inverse exponential
cutoff). I defined three new concepts and derived their quantifications: (i)DAR
profile: z-q series where z is the PL scaling parameter at different diversity
order (q); (ii)PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile: g-q series where g is
the PDO corresponding to q; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile:
Dmax-q series where Dmax is the MAD corresponding to q. Furthermore, the PDO-g
is quantified based on the self-similarity property of the PL model, and Dmax
can be estimated from the PLEC parameters. The three profiles constitute a
novel DAR approach to biodiversity scaling. I verified the postulation with the
American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1473 healthy North American
individuals (the largest human dataset from a single project to date). The PL
model was preferred due to its simplicity and established ecological properties
such as self-similarity (necessary for establishing PDO profile), and PLEC has
an advantage in establishing the MAD profile. All three profiles for the AGP

robustness of VQA models. We hypothesize that the level of noise is positively
correlated to the similarity of a basic question to the main question. Hence,
to apply noise on any given main question, we rank a pool of basic questions
based on their similarity by casting this ranking task as a LASSO optimization
problem. Then, we propose a novel robustness measure, R_score, and two
large-scale basic question datasets (BQDs) in order to standardize robustness

terminate by employing a well-established closure strategy, developed in the

arrive at a closed set of coupled equations for slowly varying local density
and orientation of the microtubules, and study its behaviour by performing a
linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations. By comparing our

refer to as hybrid stars of the second and third kind (HS2 and HS3). The HS2s
are composed of a nuclear matter core and a crust made of stable strange quark
matter, while the HS3s have both a quark mantle and a nuclear crust on top of a
nuclear matter core. For all types of stars constructed, we determine not only
their mass-radius relations, but also tidal deformabilities, Love numbers, as
well as moments of inertia and the mass distribution. We find that there exists
a range of parameter values in our model, for which the novel hybrid stars have
properties in very good agreement with all existing bounds on the stationary
properties of compact stars. In particular, the tidal deformabilities of these
solutions are smaller than those of ordinary neutron stars of the same mass,
implying that they provide an excellent fit to the recent gravitational wave
data GW170817 of LIGO and Virgo. The assumptions underlying the viability of
the different star types, in particular those corresponding to absolutely
stable quark matter, are finally discussed at some length.

which large training sets are available, but when the training data are scarce,
their performance suffers from overfitting. Many existing methods of reducing
overfitting are data-independent, and their efficacy is often limited when the
training set is very small. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated
by the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is
typically hard to parametrize explicitly and often requires human input of
tangent vectors. These methods typically only focus on the geometry of the
input data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce
geometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose a new framework,
the Low-Dimensional-Manifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which
incorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of
both the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the
network by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output
features to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are
searched efficiently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we
directly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational
functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami
equation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method
without increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate two benefits of
LDMNet in the experiments. First, we show that LDMNet significantly outperforms
widely-used network regularizers such as weight decay and DropOut. Second, we
show that LDMNet can be designed to extract common features of an object imaged
via different modalities, which proves to be very useful in real-world
applications such as cross-spectral face recognition.

properties. For instance, strain can be used to enhance the electron mobility
of a semiconductor, enabling more efficient solar cells and smaller, faster
transistors. In the context of nanomechanics, the pursuit of resonators with
ultra-high coherence has led to intense study of a complementary strain
engineering technique, ""dissipation dilution"", whereby the stiffness of a
material is effectively increased without added loss. Dissipation dilution is
known to underlie the anomalously high Q factor of Si$_3$N$_4$ nanomechanical
resonators, including recently-developed ""soft-clamped"" resonators; however,
the paradigm has to date relied on weak strain produced during material
synthesis. By contrast, the use of geometric strain engineering techniques --
capable of producing local stresses near the material yield strength -- remains
largely unexplored. Here we show that geometric strain combined with
soft-clamping can produce unprecedentedly high Q nanomechanical resonators.
Specifically, using a spatially non-uniform phononic crystal pattern, we
colocalize the strain and flexural motion of a Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam, while
increasing the former to near the yield strength. This combined strategy
produces string-like modes with room-temperature Q$\times$frequency products
approaching $10^{15}$ Hz, an unprecedented value for a mechanical oscillator of
any size. The devices we study can have force sensitivities of aN/rtHz, perform
hundreds of quantum coherent oscillations at room temperature, and attain Q >
400 million at radio frequencies. These results signal a paradigm shift in the
control of nanomechanical dissipation, with impact ranging from precision force
microscopy to tests of quantum gravity. Combining the reported approach with
crystalline or 2D materials may lead to further improvement, of as yet unknown

hundred kilometers per second. A considerable number of these clouds are
falling down towards the Galactic disk. HVCs form large and massive complexes,
so their collisions with the disk must release a great amount of energy into
the interstellar medium. The cloud-disk interaction produces two shocks, one
propagates through the cloud and the other through the disk; the properties of
these shocks depend mainly on the cloud velocity and the disk-cloud density
ratio. In this work we study the conditions necessary for these shocks to
accelerate particles by diffusive shock acceleration and the produced
non-thermal radiation. We analyze particle acceleration in both the cloud and
disk shocks. Solving a time-dependent 2-D transport equation for both
relativistic electrons and protons we obtain particle distributions and
non-thermal spectral energy distributions. In a shocked cloud significant
synchrotron radio emission is produced along with soft gamma rays. In the case
of acceleration in the shocked disk, the non-thermal radiation is stronger; the
gamma rays, of leptonic origin, might be detectable with current instruments. A
large number of protons are injected into the Galactic interstellar medium, and
locally exceed the cosmic-ray background. We conclude that under adequate
conditions the contribution from HVC-disk collisions to the galactic population
of relativistic particles and the associated extended non-thermal radiation
might be important.

ps-ABS interpolates continuously between the ""garden variety"" ABS, which
consists of two MBSs sitting on top of each other, and the topologically
protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which are separated by a distance given
by the length of the wire. Despite being topologically trivial, ps-ABSs can
generate signatures identical to MZMs in local charge tunneling experiments. In
particular, the height of the zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) generated by
ps-ABSs has the quantized value, 2e2/h, and it can remain unchanged in an
extended range of experimental parameters, such as Zeeman field and the tunnel
barrier height. We illustrate the formation of such low-energy robust ps-ABSs
in two experimentally relevant situations: a hybrid SM-SC system consisting of
a proximitized nanowire coupled to a quantum dot and the SM-SC system in the
presence of a spatially varying inhomogeneous potential. We then show that,
unlike local measurements, a two-terminal experiment involving charge tunneling
at both ends of the wire is capable of distinguishing the non-Abelian MZMs from
the generic ps-ABSs. While the MZMs localized at the opposite ends of the wire
generate correlated differential conduction spectra, including correlations in
energy splittings and critical Zeeman fields associated with the emergence of
the ZBCPs, such correlations are absent if the ZBCPs are due to ps-ABSs
emerging in the topologically trivial phase. Measuring such correlations is the
clearest and most straightforward test of topological MZMs in SM-SC

collisions with the circumburst matter, the fireball of a GRB starts to
decelerate, producing a peak or a break (depending on the circumburst density
profile) in the light curve of the afterglow. Considering all bursts with known
redshift and with an early coverage of their emission, we find 67 GRBs with a
peak in their optical or GeV light curves at a time $t_{\rm p}$. For another
106 GRBs we set an upper limit $t_{\rm p}^{\rm UL}$. We show that $t_{\rm p}$
is due to the dynamics of the fireball deceleration and not to the passage of a
characteristic frequency of the synchrotron spectrum across the optical band.
Considering the $t_{\rm p}$ of 66 long GRBs and the 85 most constraining upper
limits, using censored data analysis methods, we reconstruct the most likely
distribution of $t_{\rm p}$. All $t_{\rm p}$ are larger than the time $t_{\rm
p,g}$ when the prompt emission peaks, and are much larger than the time $t_{\rm
ph}$ when the fireball becomes transparent. The reconstructed distribution of
$\Gamma_0$ has median value $\sim$300 (150) for a uniform (wind) circumburst
density profile. In the comoving frame, long GRBs have typical isotropic

confirm that the significant correlations between $\Gamma$ and the rest frame

is a result of the {\it differential regression capability} of local
temperature fluctuations when responding to the large-scale fluctuation. An
average speed of propagations as large as $\gtrsim 15\%$ of the speed of light
may be required by this common fluctuation. Several potential physical
mechanisms for such propagations are discussed. Our interesting

measure this effect as a function of the column density of the HCD absorbers

containing the largest damping wings. We find that, even after this procedure,
there is a scale-dependent correction to the 3D Lyman-alpha forest flux power
spectrum from residual contamination. We model this residual using a simple
physical model of the HCD absorbers as linearly biased tracers of the matter
density distribution, convolved with their Voigt profiles and integrated over
the column density distribution function. We recommend the use of this model
over existing models used in data analysis, which approximate the damping wings
as top-hats and so miss shape information in the extended wings. The simple
'linear Voigt model' is statistically consistent with our simulation results
for a mock residual contamination up to small scales ($|k| <
1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$). It does not account for the effect of the highest

electron gas realize the effects of strong electron-electron repulsion in its
purest form. The kinetic energy of individual electrons is completely quenched
and all physical properties are dictated solely by many-body effects. A
remarkable consequence is the emergence of new quasiparticles with fractional
charge and exotic quantum statistics of which the most exciting ones are
non-Abelian quasiparticles. A non-integer quantized thermal Hall conductance
$\kappa_{xy}$ (in units of temperature times the universal constant $\pi^2
k_B^2 /3 h$; $h$ is the Planck constant and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant)
necessitates the existence of such quasiparticles. It has been predicted, and
verified numerically, that such states are realized in the clean half-filled
first Landau level of electrons with Coulomb repulsion, with $\kappa_{xy}$
being either $3/2$ or $7/2$. Excitingly, a recent experiment has indeed
observed a half-integer value, which was measured, however, to be
$\kappa_{xy}=5/2$. We resolve this contradiction within a picture where smooth
disorder results in the formation of mesoscopic puddles with locally
$\kappa_{xy}=3/2$ or $7/2$. Interactions between these puddles generate a
coherent macroscopic state, which is reflected in an extended plateau with
quantized $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$. The topological properties of quasiparticles at
large distances are determined by the macroscopic phase, and not by the
microscopic puddle where they reside. In principle, the same mechanism might
also allow non-Abelian quasiparticles to emerge from a system comprised of
microscopic Abelian puddles.

TeV spectrum, locating the peak of their gamma-ray emission in the spectral

for the Compton emission, using a standard one-zone leptonic model. We study
six examples of this new type of BL Lacs in the hard X-ray band with the NuSTAR
satellite. Together with simultaneous observations with the SWIFT satellite, we
fully constrain the peak of the synchrotron emission in their SED, and test the
leptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. We confirm the extreme nature of
5 objects also in the synchrotron emission. We do not find evidence of
additional emission components in the hard X-ray band. We find that a one-zone
SSC model can in principle reproduce the extreme properties of both peaks in
the SED, from X-ray up to TeV energies, but at the cost of i) extreme electron
energies with very low radiative efficiency, ii) conditions heavily out of
equipartition (by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude), and iii) not accounting for the
simultaneous UV data, which then should belong to a different emission
component, possibly the same as the far-IR (WISE) data. We find evidence of

produce equations defining the union of two irreducible components, the

active galactic nuclei has long been under debate; some of the possible sites
are the outer accretion disk, the broad line region, a molecular torus, or
interstellar/intracluster media. In February-March 2016, we performed the first
X-ray microcalorimeter spectroscopy with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS)
onboard the Hitomi satellite of the Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxy NGC 1275
at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. With the high energy
resolution of ~5 eV at 6 keV achieved by Hitomi/SXS, we detected the
Fe-K{\alpha} line with ~5.4 {\sigma} significance. The velocity width is
constrained to be 500-1600 km s$^{-1}$ (FWHM for Gaussian models) at 90%
confidence. The SXS also constrains the continuum level from the NGC 1275
nucleus up to ~20 keV, giving an equivalent width ~20 eV of the 6.4 keV line.
Because the velocity width is narrower than that of broad H{\alpha} line of
~2750 km s$^{-1}$, we can exclude a large contribution to the line flux from
the accretion disk and the broad line region. Furthermore, we performed pixel
map analyses on the Hitomi/SXS data and image analyses on the Chandra archival
data, and revealed that the Fe-K{\alpha} line comes from a region within ~1.6
kpc from the NGC 1275 core, where an active galactic nucleus emission
dominates, rather than that from intracluster media. Therefore, we suggest that
the source of the Fe-K{\alpha} line from NGC 1275 is likely a low-covering
fraction molecular torus or a rotating molecular disk which probably extends
from a pc to hundreds pc scale in the active galactic nucleus system.

networks include simplicial complexes formed not only by nodes and links but
also by triangles, tetrahedra, etc. More in general, higher-order networks can
be cell-complexes formed by gluing convex polytopes along their faces.
Interestingly, higher order networks have a natural geometric interpretation
and therefore constitute a natural way to explore the discrete network geometry
of complex networks. Here we investigate the rich interplay between emergent
network geometry of higher order networks and their complexity in the framework
of a non-equilibrium model called Network Geometry with Flavor. This model,
originally proposed for capturing the evolution of simplicial complexes, is
here extended to cell-complexes formed by subsequently gluing different copies
of an arbitrary regular polytope. We reveal the interplay between complexity
and geometry of the higher order networks generated by the model by studying
the emergent community structure and the degree distribution as a function of
the regular polytope forming its building blocks. Additionally we discuss the
underlying hyperbolic nature of the emergent geometry and we relate the
spectral dimension of the higher-order network to the dimension and nature of
its building blocks.

galaxies in terms of colour and age of stellar population as function of the
virial mass and distance to the geometric centre of the group. However, we find
that LINER are more likely to populate low density environments in spite of
their morphology, which is typical of high density regions such as rich galaxy
clusters. For rich (poor) galaxy groups, the occurrence of LINER is $\sim$2
times lower (higher) than the occurrence of matched, non-LINER galaxies.
Moreover, LINER hosts do not seem to follow the expected morphology-density
relation in groups of high virial mass. The high frequency of LINERS in low
density regions could be due to the combination of a sufficiently ample gas
reservoir to power the low ionization emission and/or enhanced galaxy
interaction rates benefiting the gas flow toward their central regions.

structure of turbulence in jets in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic
regimes. Spectral (frequency-space) proper orthogonal decomposition is used to
extract energy spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked coherent
structures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent
analysis. Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode
numbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank response characterized by
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular shear layer
up to the end of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the
very-near-nozzle shear layer. These modes too the have been experimentally
observed before and predicted by quasi-parallel stability theory and other
approximations--they comprise a considerable portion of the total turbulent
energy. At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and
again at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not
low rank, but consists of a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes,
which are primarily active downstream of the potential core, are associated
with the Orr mechanism. They occur also as sub-dominant modes in the range of
frequencies dominated by the KH response. Our global analysis helps tie
together previous observations based on local spatial stability theory, and
explains why quasi-parallel predictions were successful at some frequencies and
azimuthal wavenumbers, but failed at others.

applications. The most commonly proposed approaches to date rely on exploiting
time-resolved measurements, i.e., measuring the time it takes for short light
pulses to transit the scene. This typically requires expensive, specialized,
ultrafast lasers and detectors that must be carefully calibrated. We develop an
alternative approach that exploits the valuable role that natural occluders in
a scene play in enabling accurate and practical image formation in such
settings without such hardware complexity. In particular, we demonstrate that
the presence of occluders in the hidden scene can obviate the need for
collecting time-resolved measurements, and develop an accompanying analysis for
such systems and their generalizations. Ultimately, the results suggest the
potential to develop increasingly sophisticated future systems that are able to
identify and exploit diverse structural features of the environment to
reconstruct scenes hidden from view.

CNNs are a powerful class of artificial neural networks, characterized by

have the ability to automatically extract general characteristic features from
data sets and create abstract data representations which can perform very

While various preventive measures exist (i.a., vaccination and school

efficient use remains challenging. To this end, individual-based
epidemiological models are essential to assist decision makers in determining
the best strategy to curb epidemic spread. However, individual-based models are
computationally intensive and it is therefore pivotal to identify the optimal
strategy using a minimal amount of model evaluations. Additionally, as
epidemiological modeling experiments need to be planned, a computational budget
needs to be specified a priori. Consequently, we present a new sampling
technique to optimize the evaluation of preventive strategies using fixed
budget best-arm identification algorithms. We use epidemiological modeling
theory to derive knowledge about the reward distribution which we exploit using
Bayesian best-arm identification algorithms (i.e., Top-two Thompson sampling
and BayesGap). We evaluate these algorithms in a realistic experimental setting
and demonstrate that it is possible to identify the optimal strategy using only
a limited number of model evaluations, i.e., 2-to-3 times faster compared to
the uniform sampling method, the predominant technique used for epidemiological
decision making in the literature. Finally, we contribute and evaluate a
statistic for Top-two Thompson sampling to inform the decision makers about the
confidence of an arm recommendation.

strong linearizations of a matrix polynomial $P(\lambda)$, regular and
singular, with good properties. As a consequence of this research, families
such as the family of Fiedler pencils, the family of generalized Fiedler
pencils (GFP), the family of Fiedler pencils with repetition, and the family of
generalized Fiedler pencils with repetition (GFPR) were constructed. In
particular, one of the goals was to find in these families structured
linearizations of structured matrix polynomials. For example, if a matrix
polynomial $P(\lambda)$ is symmetric (Hermitian), it is convenient to use
linearizations of $P(\lambda)$ that are also symmetric (Hermitian). Both the
family of GFP and the family of GFPR contain block-symmetric linearizations of
$P(\lambda)$, which are symmetric (Hermitian) when $P(\lambda)$ is. Now the
objective is to determine which of those structured linearizations have the
best numerical properties. The main obstacle for this study is the fact that
these pencils are defined implicitly as products of so-called elementary
matrices. In this paper we consider the family of block-minimal bases pencils,
whose pencils are defined in terms of their block-structure, as a source of
canonical forms for block-symmetric pencils. More precisely, we present four
families of block-symmetric pencils which, under some generic nonsingularity
conditions are block minimal bases pencils and strong linearizations of a
matrix polynomial. We show that the block-symmetric GFP and GFPR, after some
row and column permutations, belong to the union of these four families. Hence,
these four families of pencils provide an alternative but explicit approach to
the block-symmetric Fiedler-like pencils existing in the literature.

interacting bosonic system subjected to an Abelian flux. We develop a new and
systematic OFQD analysis to determine the true quantum ground state and the

Goldstone modes with 3 different velocities. One of which is generated by the

of temporal graph motifs that can capture spatio-temporal communication

Scaling of the superfluid density at incommensurate filling of $\rho=1.1$ and

controllers is optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and the output weights of
ANNs are optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The
controllers are radial bias function (RBF)-based, but to improve the robustness
of RBF controller, an error-integral term is added to RBF equation in the
second scheme. Experimental results show that GA- PSO-optimized improved RBF
(I-RBF) model controls network congestion effectively in terms of link
utilization with a low packet loss rate and outperform Drop Tail,
proportional-integral (PI), random exponential marking (REM), and adaptive
random early detection (ARED) controllers.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate poverty directly from high and

imagery with spatial resolutions of 3-5 sq. m. and 50 sq. cm. respectively,
covering all 2 million sq. km. of Mexico. Benchmark poverty estimates come from
the 2014 MCS-ENIGH combined with the 2015 Intercensus and are used to estimate
poverty rates for 2,456 Mexican municipalities. CNNs are trained using the 896
municipalities in the 2014 MCS-ENIGH. We experiment with several architectures
(GoogleNet, VGG) and use GoogleNet as a final architecture where weights are
fine-tuned from ImageNet. We find that 1) the best models, which incorporate
satellite-estimated land use as a predictor, explain approximately 57% of the
variation in poverty in a validation sample of 10 percent of MCS-ENIGH
municipalities; 2) Across all MCS-ENIGH municipalities explanatory power
reduces to 44% in a CNN prediction and landcover model; 3) Predicted poverty
from the CNN predictions alone explains 47% of the variation in poverty in the

(45) Eugenia presents larger stable regions for both, prograde and retrograde

It is
particularly useful in prediction settings with high-dimensional covariates.
The existing literature treating of Bayesian approaches is relatively sparse.
We introduce a Bayesian approach that is robust to outliers in both the
dependent variable and the covariates. Outliers can be thought of as
observations that are not in line with the general trend. The proposed approach
automatically penalises these observations so that their impact on the
posterior gradually vanishes as they move further and further away from the
general trend, corresponding to a concept in Bayesian statistics called whole
robustness. The predictions produced are thus consistent with the bulk of the
data. The approach also exploits the geometry of principal components to
efficiently identify those that are significant. Individual predictions
obtained from the resulting models are consolidated according to
model-averaging mechanisms to account for model uncertainty. The approach is
evaluated on real data and compared to its nonrobust Bayesian counterpart, the
traditional frequentist approach, and a commonly employed robust frequentist

to the deployment of more effective interventions. Typically the presence and
detection of malaria-vectoring mosquitoes is only quantified by hand-operated
insect traps or signified by the diagnosis of malaria. If we are to gather
timely, large-scale data to improve this situation, we need to automate the

previous best known and optimal solutions, and further improved 12 upper

  Our algorithm design process is split into two phases: (i) development of
algorithmic components such as local search procedures and mutation operators,
and (ii) composition of a metaheuristic from the available components. Phase
(i) requires human expertise and often can be completed by implementing several
simple domain-specific routines known from the literature. Phase (ii) is
entirely automated by employing the Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS)
framework. In CMCS, a metaheuristic is flexibly defined by a set of parameters,
called configuration. Then the process of composition of a metaheuristic from
the algorithmic components is reduced to an optimisation problem seeking the
best performing CMCS configuration.
  We discuss the problem of comparing configurations, and propose a new
efficient technique to select the best performing configuration from a large
set. To employ this method, we restrict the original CMCS to a simple
deterministic case that leaves us with a finite and manageable number of
meaningful configurations.

properties are obtained by evaluating kaon-antikaon loop contributions to the
$\phi$-meson self-energy, employing medium-modified kaon masses calculated
using the quark-meson coupling model. The loop integral is regularized with a
dipole form factor, and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of cutoff
mass in the form factor is investigated. At normal nuclear matter density, we
find a downward shift of the $\phi$ mass by a few percent, while the decay
width is enhanced by an order of magnitude.
  Our results support the literature which suggest that one should observe a
small downward mass shift and a large broadening of the decay width. In the

absorption widths for four selected nuclei, calculated by solving the
Klein-Gordon equation with complex optical potentials. The attractive potential
for the $\phi$-meson in the nuclear medium originates from the in-medium
enhanced KK loop in the $\phi$-meson selfenergy. The results suggest that the
$\phi$-meson should form bound states with all the nuclei considered. However,
the identification of the signal for these predicted bound states will need
careful investigation because of their sizable absorption widths.

free-electron theory for the description of electronic distribution which is
not a valid assumption for modern materials with nonparabolic energy
dispersion. In this paper, we derive analytically a generalized Fowler-Nordheim

dispersion on field-emission from narrow-gap semiconductors and few-layer
graphene using Kane's band model. The traditional FN equation is shown to be a
limiting case of our model in the limit of a perfectly flat surface of a

this model can be experimentally calculated from appropriate current-voltage

breaking on CNF formulas. Nevertheless, little has been said about its use in
the context of AllSAT problems: problems where we are interested in listing all
the models of a Boolean formula. AllSAT has gained much popularity in recent
years due to its many applications in domains like model checking, data mining,
etc. One example of a particularly transparent application of AllSAT to other
fields of computer science is computational Ramsey theory. In this paper we
study the effect of incorporating Shatter to the workflow of using Boolean
formulas to generate all possible edge colorings of a graph avoiding prescribed
monochromatic subgraphs. Generating complete sets of colorings is an important
building block in computational Ramsey theory. We identify two drawbacks in the
na\""ive use of Shatter to break the symmetries of Boolean formulas encoding
Ramsey-type problems for graphs: a ""blow-up"" in the number of models and the
generation of incomplete sets of colorings. The issues presented in this work
are not intended to discourage the use of Shatter as a preprocessing tool for
AllSAT problems in combinatorial computing but to help researchers properly use
this tool by avoiding these potential pitfalls. To this end, we provide
strategies and additional tools to cope with the negative effects of using
Shatter for AllSAT. While the specific application addressed in this paper is
that of Ramsey-type problems, the analysis we carry out applies to many other
areas in which highly-symmetrical Boolean formulas arise and we wish to find
all of their models.

atmospheres pulsate as they cool across the temperature range,
$12500\,\mathrm{K} \gtrsim T_{\mathrm{eff}} \gtrsim 10800\,\mathrm{K}$. Known
as DAVs or ZZ Ceti stars, their oscillations are attributed to overstable
g-modes excited by convective driving. The effective temperature at the blue
edge of the instability strip is slightly lower than that at which a surface
convection zone appears. The temperature at the red edge is a two-decade old
puzzle. Recently, {\it Kepler} discovered a number of cool DAVs which pulsate
at higher frequencies and with much smaller photometric amplitudes than
expected based on trends extrapolated from DAVs found by ground based
observations. Remarkably, some of them exhibit sporadic outbursts separated by
days, each lasting several hours, and releasing $\sim

the red edge and the outbursts. The minimal frequency for overstable modes
rises abruptly near the red edge. Although high frequency overstable modes
exist below the red edge, their photometric amplitudes are generally too small

shown to lead to maximum likelihood estimates of the dynamic network and
therefore to minimum variance properties, reaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound

$\beta_\parallel\gg1$ the growth rate becomes independent of $\beta_\parallel$.

manual fitting of the {\it ab initio} energies with analytical functions. The
PES are built from a small number of {\it ab initio} points by an iterative
process that incrementally samples the most relevant parts of the configuration
space. Using the dynamical results of previous authors as targets, we show that
such feedback loops produce accurate global PES with 30 {\it ab initio}

scattering calculations for H$_3$ and 600 scattering calculations for OH$_3$.
We also introduce a method that quickly converges to an accurate PES without
the {\it a priori} knowledge of the dynamical results. By construction, our
method illustrates the lowest number of potential energy points (i.e. the
minimum information) required for the non-parametric construction of global PES

that the new phenomenon can be accommodated by the inclusion of unitarity
corrections to a simple Regge (pomeron) pole exchange. Interestingly, the
odderon may also promote the acceleration of $B(s)$. The onset of the new

measurable in a unitarized Regge dipole. Unitarization proves crucial in
fitting the data, especially those on the slope $B(s)$ showing a change from
the $\ln (s)$ to $\ln^2 (s)$ behavior. Having fitted the free parameters of the
unitarized model to the data, we predict the behavior of the cross sections and
the slope at still higher energies, including those asymptotic.

detection of the GR precession of stars, the measurement of extended dark mass,

optimize for a task specific objective. The optimal solutions to such tasks are
heavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i.e. the
configuration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches,
however, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort
searching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In
this paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search
strategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the
information uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a
problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given
iteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning
action. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial information based
policies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key
insight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would
easily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a
novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train planning
policies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle - an oracle that at train time has
full knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We
leverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently
computed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy. We examine
two important domains that rely on partial information based policies -
informative path planning and search based motion planning. We validate the
approach on a spectrum of environments for both problem domains, including
experiments on a real UAV, and show that the learnt policy consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

specific applications, we provide new inference procedures for three types of

hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view
projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for
3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that
unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage,

into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each
voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel
feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a
descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to
generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that
VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a
large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative
representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging
results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.

unknown interference in randomized experiments. The inferential target is a
generalization of the average treatment effect estimand that marginalizes over
potential spillover effects. We show that estimators commonly used to estimate
treatment effects under no interference are consistent for the generalized
estimand for several common experimental designs under limited but otherwise
arbitrary and unknown interference. The rates of convergence depend on the rate
at which the amount of interference grows and the degree to which it aligns
with dependencies in treatment assignment. Importantly for practitioners, the
results imply that if one erroneously assumes that units do not interfere in a

nevertheless likely to be close to an average treatment effect if the sample is
sufficiently large. Conventional confidence statements may, however, not be

""Self-induced"" motion is observed when single droplets are placed close to a

horizontal plates, they interact at a longer distance with modified dynamics.
Finally, confining the droplet in a tunnel, the range of attraction is greatly
enhanced, as the droplet moves all the way up the tunnel when an external

dimension values of cities include prefractal structure, multi-scaling fractal
patterns, and self-affine fractal growth. The solution to the problem is to
substitute the real fractal dimension values with comparable fractal
dimensions. The main measures are as follows: First, select a proper method for
a special fractal study. Second, define a proper study area for a city
according to a study aim, or define comparable study areas for different
cities. These suggestions may be helpful for the students who takes interest in

investigated in each molecular cloud component, and the bubble is found at the
interface of these two filamentary molecular clouds. The Herschel temperature
map traces all these structures in a temperature range of ~16-24 K. In the
velocity space of 13CO, the two molecular clouds are separated by ~7 km/sec,
and are interconnected by a lower intensity intermediate velocity emission
(i.e. a broad bridge feature). A possible complementary molecular pair at [87,

a possible emergence of a helical or stripe superconducting phase. Our results

or a resonant-exchange qubit. While it is generally believed that the decisive
advantage of the resonant-exchange qubit is the suppression of charge noise
because it is operated at a sweet spot, we show that the leakage is also an
important factor. Through molecular-orbital-theoretic calculations, we show
that when the system is operated in the exchange-only scheme, the leakage to
states with double electron occupancy in quantum dots is severe when rotations
around the axis 120$^\circ$ from $\hat{z}$ is performed. While this leakage can
be reduced by either shrinking the dots or separating them further, the
exchange interactions are also suppressed at the same time, making the gate
operations unfavorably slow. When the system is operated as a resonant-exchange
qubit, the leakage is 3-5 orders of magnitude smaller. We have also calculated
the optimal detuning point which minimizes the leakage for the
resonant-exchange qubit, and have found that although it does not coincide with
the double-sweet-spot for the charge noise, they are rather close. Our results
suggest that the resonant-exchange qubit has another advantage that leakage can
be greatly suppressed compared to the exchange-only qubit, and operating at the

A spin-flip reflection is demonstrated at the interface, where a spin-up
electron incident from the normal metal can be reflected as a spin-down
electron and the spin $2\times \hbar/2$ will be injected into the spin
superconductor. When the (spin) voltage is smaller than the gap of the spin
superconductor, the spin-flip reflection determines the transport properties of
the junction. We consider both graphene-based (linear-dispersion-relation) and
quadratic-dispersion-relation normal metal-spin superconductor junctions in
detail. For the two-dimensional graphene-based junction, the spin-flip
reflected electron can be along the specular direction (retro-direction) when
the incident and reflected electron locates in the same band (different bands).
A perfect spin-flip reflection can occur when the incident electron is normal
to the interface, and the reflection coefficient is slightly suppressed for the
oblique incident case. As a comparison, for the one-dimensional
quadratic-dispersion-relation junction, the spin-flip reflection coefficient
can reach 1 at certain incident energies. In addition, both the charge current
and the spin current under a charge (spin) voltage are studied. The spin
conductance is proportional to the spin-flip reflection coefficient when the
spin voltage is less than the gap of the spin superconductor. These results
will help us get a better understanding of spin transport through the normal
metal-spin superconductor junction.

appropriate batch size at each epoch with a probability defined as a function
of its previous success/failure. This probability encourages exploration of
different batch size and then later exploitation of batch size with history of
success. At each epoch, the RMGD samples a batch size from its probability
distribution, then uses the selected batch size for mini-batch gradient
descent. After obtaining the validation loss at each epoch, the probability
distribution is updated to incorporate the effectiveness of the sampled batch
size. The RMGD essentially assists the learning process to explore the possible
domain of the batch size and exploit successful batch size. Experimental
results show that the RMGD achieves performance better than the best performing
single batch size. Furthermore, it, obviously, attains this performance in a
shorter amount of time than grid search. It is surprising that the RMGD
achieves better performance than grid search.

found an RP in the northeastern region, this is the first report on RPs in the
other parts of the remnant. The electron temperature $kT_e$ of the CIE
component is almost uniform at $\sim 0.2$ keV across the remnant. The CIE
plasma has metal abundances consistent with solar and is concentrated toward
the rim of the remnant, suggesting that it is of shocked interstellar medium
origin. The two RP components have different $kT_e$: one in the range of
0.16$-$0.28 keV and the other in the range of 0.48$-$0.67 keV. The electron
temperatures of both RP components decrease toward the southeast, where the SNR
shock is known to be interacting with a molecular cloud. We also find the

the plausible cooling mechanisms is thermal conduction between the hot plasma

Rubenstein et al. presented a system (""Programmable self-assembly in a

only solid shapes with the robots in aggregated form by applying the collective
behavior algorithm. Even though agent-based approaches have been presented in
various studies for self-organized formation, however these studies lack
agent-based modeling (ABM) approach along with the constraints in term of
structure complexity and heterogeneity in large swarms with dynamic
localization. The cognitive agent-based computing (CABC) approach is capable of
modeling such self-organization based multi-agents systems (MAS). In this
paper, we develop a simulation model using ABM under CABC approach for
self-organized shape formation in swarm robots. We propose a shape formation
algorithm for validating our model and perform simulation-based experiments for
six different shapes including hole-based shapes. We also demonstrate the
formal specification for our model. The simulation result shows the robustness

harder with multiple objectives. In fact, Krause et al.\ (2008) showed that
when the number of objectives $m$ grows as the cardinality $k$ i.e.,
$m=\Omega(k)$, the problem is inapproximable (unless $P=NP$). On the other
hand, when $m$ is constant Chekuri et al.\ (2010) showed a randomized
$(1-1/e)-\epsilon$ approximation with runtime (number of queries to function
oracle) $n^{m/\epsilon^3}$. %In fact, the result of Chekuri et al.\ (2010) is
for the far more general case of matroid constant.
  We focus on finding a fast and practical algorithm that has (asymptotic)
approximation guarantees even when $m$ is super constant. We first modify the
algorithm of Chekuri et al.\ (2010) to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation for
$m=o(\frac{k}{\log^3 k})$. This demonstrates a steep transition from constant
factor approximability to inapproximability around $m=\Omega(k)$. Then using
Multiplicative-Weight-Updates (MWU), we find a much faster

the above results are all randomized, we also give a simple deterministic

realize periodic PT-symmetric potentials based on optical lattices. Here, we
experimentally construct a spatially periodic PT-symmetric optical potential
based on gain-loss arrays induced in a coherently-prepared atomic medium. The
gain and loss arrays are generated in alternating four-level N-type and
three-level $\Lambda$-type configurations in the same atomic medium,
respectively, which do not require discrete diffractions as demonstrated in the
previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 123601(2016)] and can be easier to realize
with more relaxed operating conditions. The dynamical behaviors of the system
are investigated by measuring the phase difference between two adjacent gain
and loss channels. The demonstrated PT-symmetric optical lattice with easy
accessibility and better tunability sets a new stage for further exploiting the
peculiar physical properties in periodic non-Hermitian systems.

multi-walled carbon nanotubes/silicone rubber nanocomposites as a
representative example, and have for the first time studied the correlation
between high-frequency dielectric dispersion and static/dynamic interfacial
characteristics. We have found that the interface together with other
meso-structural parameters (volume fraction, dispersion, agglomeration) play
decisive role in formulating the dielectric patterns. The calculation of the
relaxation times affords the relative importance of interfacial polarization to
dipolar polarization in resultant dielectric relaxation. Dielectric
measurements coupled with cyclic loading further reveals the remarkable
capability of dielectric frequency dispersion in capturing the evolution of
interfacial properties, such as a particular interface reconstruction process
occurred to the surfactant-modified samples. All these results demonstrate that
high-frequency dielectric spectroscopy is instrumental to probing both static
and dynamic meso-structural characteristics, especially effective for the
composites with relative weak interfaces which remains a mission impossible for
many other techniques. The insights provided here based on the analyses of
dielectric frequency dispersion will pave the way for optimized design and

to a stationary point at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ in our setting,
where $T$ is the number of total iterations. Numerous simulations and
real-world data experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the

transfer which has shown great promise in natural image generation. Existing
style transfer methods for natural images generally assume that the source and
target images share similar high-frequency features. However, this assumption
is no longer true in typeface transformation. Inspired by the recent
advancement in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we propose a
Hierarchical Adversarial Network (HAN) for typeface transformation. The
proposed HAN consists of two sub-networks: a transfer network and a
hierarchical adversarial discriminator. The transfer network maps characters
from one typeface to another. A unique characteristic of typefaces is that the
same radicals may have quite different appearances in different characters even
under the same typeface. Hence, a stage-decoder is employed by the transfer
network to leverage multiple feature layers, aiming to capture both the global
and local features. The hierarchical adversarial discriminator implicitly
measures data discrepancy between the generated domain and the target domain.
To leverage the complementary discriminating capability of different feature
layers, a hierarchical structure is proposed for the discriminator. We have
experimentally demonstrated that HAN is an effective framework for typeface
transfer and characters restoration.

However,
most existing methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between

encoder, content encoder, mixer and decoder. The style encoder and content
encoder are used to extract the style and content factors from the style

a bilinear model to integrate the above two factors and finally feeds it into a
decoder to generate images with target style and content. To separate the style
features and content features, we leverage the conditional dependence of styles

extract styles and contents from two sets of reference images in limited size,
one with shared style and the other with shared content. This learning
framework allows simultaneous style transfer among multiple styles and can be
deemed as a special `multi-task' learning scenario. The encoders are expected
to capture the underlying features for different styles and contents which is
generalizable to new styles and contents. For validation, we applied the

extremely well at a variety of tasks including subtasks of autonomous driving

designed for these tasks typically require vast quantities of training data and
long training periods to converge. We investigate the design rationale behind
end-to-end driving network designs by proposing and comparing three small and
computationally inexpensive deep end-to-end neural network models that generate
driving control signals directly from input images. In contrast to prior work
that segments the autonomous driving task, our models take on a novel approach
to the autonomous driving problem by utilizing deep and thin Fully
Convolutional Nets (FCNs) with recurrent neural nets and low parameter counts
to tackle a complex end-to-end regression task predicting both steering and
acceleration commands. In addition, we include layers optimized for
classification to allow the networks to implicitly learn image semantics. We
show that the resulting networks use 3x fewer parameters than the most recent
comparable end-to-end driving network and 500x fewer parameters than the
AlexNet variations and converge both faster and to lower losses while
maintaining robustness against overfitting.

iteration process of GPI, the proposed Max-SR method can readily double its
convergence speed compared to the random choice of initial value. With only
four iterations, it may rapidly converge to its rate ceil. From simulation
results, it follows that the SR performance of the proposed AIS of GPI-based

several regimes such as when the dimensionality is low, the density is high,
the interactions are strong, or for low particle numbers. In this paper we
propose a fundamentally different regime for enhanced quantum fluctuations
without being restricted by any of the above conditions. Instead, our scheme
relies on the engineering of an effective attractive interaction in a dilute,
two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) consisting of thousands of atoms.
In such a regime, the quantum spin fluctuations are significantly enhanced
(atom bunching with respect to the noninteracting limit) since they act to
reduce the interaction energy - a remarkable property given that spin
fluctuations are normally suppressed (anti-bunching) at zero temperature. In
contrast to the case of true attractive interactions, our approach is not
vulnerable to BEC collapse. We numerically demonstrate that these quantum
fluctuations are experimentally accessible by either spin or single-component
Bragg spectroscopy, offering a useful platform on which to test
beyond-mean-field theories. We also develop a variational model and use it to
analytically predict the shift of the immiscibility critical point, finding

releasing small unbound grains that enter a debris disc located further away
from the star, triggering there a collisional chain reaction that can
potentially create detectable transient structures. We explore this mechanism,
using for the first time a code coupling dynamical and collisional evolutions,
and investigate if avalanches could explain the short-term luminosity
variations observed in some extremely bright discs. We consider two set-ups: a
cold disc case, with a dust release at 10au and an outer disc extending from 50
to 120au, and a warm disc case with the release at 1au and a 5-12au outer disc.
We find that avalanches could leave detectable structures on resolved images,
for both cold and warm disc cases, in discs with optical depth $\tau$ of a few
$10^{-3}$, provided that large dust masses
($\gtrsim$10$^{20}$-5$\times$10$^{22}$g) are initially released. The integrated
photometric excess due to an avalanche is limited, less than 10% for these
released dust masses, peaking in the mid-IR and becoming insignificant beyond
$\sim$40-50$\mu$m. Contrary to earlier studies, we do not obtain stronger
avalanches when increasing $\tau$ to higher values. Likewise, we do not observe
a significant luminosity deficit, as compared to the pre-avalanche level, after
the passage of the avalanche. These two results concur to make avalanches an
unlikely explanation for the sharp luminosity drops observed in some extremely
bright debris discs. The ideal configuration for observing an avalanche would
be a two-belt structure, with an inner belt of fractional luminosity >10$^{-4}$
where breakups of massive planetesimals occur, and a more massive outer belt,
with $\tau$ of a few $10^{-3}$, into which the avalanche chain reaction
develops and propagates.

For IC problems with $MAIS=n-1$ and $MAIS=n-2$, prior work has shown that
binary (over ${\mathbb F}_2$) linear index codes achieve the $MAIS$ lower bound
for the broadcast rate and thus are optimal. In this work, we use the the

the oscillations in the nearby sunspot umbra were impulsively excited when the
intensity of the brightening reached its peak. The initial period of the
oscillations was about 2.3 minutes and then gradually increased to 3.0 minutes

brings the superresolution effect from the near-field to the far-field zone.
For effective application of the hyperlens it should operate in so-called
canalization regime, when the phase advancement of the propagating fields is
maximally supressed, and thus field broadening is minimized. For conventional
hyperlenses it is relatively straightforward to achieve canalization by tuning
the anisotropic permittivity tensor. However, for a dark-field hyperlens
designed to image weak scatterers by filtering out background radiation
(dark-field regime) this approach is not viable, because design requirements
for such filtering and elimination of phase advancement i.e. canalization, are
mutually exclusive. Here we propose the use of magnetic ($\mu$-positive and
negative) HMMs to achieve phase cancellation at the output equivalent to the
performance of a HMM in the canalized regime. The proposed structure offers
additional flexibility over simple HMMs in tuning light propagation. We show
that in this ``pseudocanalizing'' configuration quality of an image is
comparable to a conventional hyperlens, while the desired filtering of the
incident illumination associated with the dark-field hyperlens is preserved.

difficulty. This typically means 1) few training samples per identity, and 2)
thus the lack of diversity among the training samples. Consequently, we face
high risk of over-fitting when training the convolutional neural network (CNN),
a state-of-the-art method in person re-ID. To reduce the risk of over-fitting,
this paper proposes a Pseudo Positive Regularization (PPR) method to enrich the
diversity of the training data. Specifically, unlabeled data from an
independent pedestrian database is retrieved using the target training data as
query. A small proportion of these retrieved samples are randomly selected as
the Pseudo Positive samples and added to the target training set for the
supervised CNN training. The addition of Pseudo Positive samples is therefore a
data augmentation method to reduce the risk of over-fitting during CNN
training. We implement our idea in the identification CNN models (i.e.,
CaffeNet, VGGNet-16 and ResNet-50). On CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets,
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves
the baseline and yields competitive performance to the state-of-the-art person
re-ID methods.

enable fast signal map creation given a dedicated surveyor with a smartphone

magnetometer data to estimate the surveyor's trajectory post-hoc using
Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping and particle filtering to incorporate a
building floorplan. We demonstrate conventional methods can fail to recover the
survey path robustly and determine the room unambiguously. To counter this we
use a novel loop closure detection method based on magnetic field signals and
propose to incorporate the magnetic loop closures and straight-line constraints
into the filtering process to ensure robust trajectory recovery. We show this
allows room ambiguities to be resolved.
  An entire building can be surveyed by the proposed system in minutes rather
than days. We evaluate in a large office space and compare to state-of-the-art
approaches. We achieve trajectories within 1.1 m of the ground truth 90% of the
time. Output signal maps well approximate those built from conventional,
laborious manual survey. We also demonstrate that the signal maps built by
PFSurvey provide similar or even better positioning performance than the manual

distributed machine learning paradigm called Advanced Model Server (AMS). With
the well known Parameter Server (PS) framework, each server node handles a
separate part of parameters and updates them independently. AMS goes beyond
this and is designed to be capable of learning a unified image descriptor model
shared by all server nodes which embeds large images into low dimensional high
level features before transmitting images to worker nodes. AMS thus
dramatically reduces the communication load and enables the arduous joint
training process. Based on AMS, the methods of effectively combining the images

three-dimensionally, we define a plane in the phase space to build the
Poincar\'e surface of sections. Despite the extra dimension, the sections

we have also been able to map stable and chaotic regions, as well as to find

as in everyday life, with applications ranging from body scanners at airport

waveguides and other devices to manipulate radiation are well established. This
is not yet the case in the THz regime because of the strong interaction of THz
radiation with matter, leading to absorption, and the millimeter size of the
wavelength and therefore of the required waveguides. We propose the use of a
new material, polyurethane, for waveguides that allows high flexibility,
overcoming the problem that large sizes otherwise result in rigid structures.
With this material we realize antiresonant hollow-core waveguides and we use
the flexibility of the material to mechanically twist the waveguide in a
tunable and reversible manner, with twist periods as short as tens of
wavelengths. Twisting the waveguide, we demonstrate the generation of modes
carrying orbital angular momentum. We use THz time domain spectroscopy to
measure and clearly visualize the vortex nature of the mode, which is difficult
in the optical domain. The proposed waveguide is a new platform offering new
perspectives for THz guidance and particularly mode manipulation. The
demonstrated ability to generate modes with orbital angular momentum within a
waveguide, in a controllable manner, will be beneficial to both fundamental,
e.g. matter-radiation interaction, and applied, e.g. THz telecommunications,
advances of THz research and technology. Moreover, this platform is not limited

algorithm for finding the closest point in the intersection of convex sets to
any arbitrary point in a Hilbert space. This method can be seen as an adequate
modification of the Douglas--Rachford method that yields a solution to the best
approximation problem. In this paper we consider the particular case of two
subspaces in a Euclidean space. We obtain the rate of linear convergence of the
AAMR method in terms of the Friedrichs angle between the subspaces and the
parameters defining the scheme, by studying the linear convergence rates of the
powers of matrices. We further optimize the value of these parameters in order
to get the minimal convergence rate, which turns out to be better than the one
of other projection methods. Finally, we provide some numerical experiments
that demonstrate the theoretical results.

vectors are sparsified in such a way that only the top-k elements (in terms of
magnitude) are kept. As a result, only k rows or columns (depending on the
layout) of the weight matrix are modified, leading to a linear reduction in the
computational cost. Based on the sparsified gradients, we further simplify the
model by eliminating the rows or columns that are seldom updated, which will
reduce the computational cost both in the training and decoding, and
potentially accelerate decoding in real-world applications. Surprisingly,
experimental results demonstrate that most of time we only need to update fewer
than 5% of the weights at each back propagation pass. More interestingly, the
accuracy of the resulting models is actually improved rather than degraded, and
a detailed analysis is given. The model simplification results show that we
could adaptively simplify the model which could often be reduced by around 9x,

The vectorization and normalization operations are performed in the
vectorization layer for reducing the redundancy and accelerating the
convergence. The SPD matrix in our network can be considered as a mid-level

it is responsible for a drastic drag increase in flows over bounding surfaces.
While much effort is invested into developing ways to control and reduce
turbulence intensities, so far no methods exist to altogether eliminate
turbulence if velocities are sufficiently large. We demonstrate for pipe flow
that appropriate distortions to the velocity profile lead to a complete
collapse of turbulence and subsequently friction losses are reduced by as much
as 95%. Counterintuitively, the return to laminar motion is accomplished by
initially increasing turbulence intensities or by transiently amplifying wall
shear. The usual measures of turbulence levels, such as the Reynolds number
(Re) or shear stresses, do not account for the subsequent relaminarization.
Instead an amplification mechanism measuring the interaction between eddies and
the mean shear is found to set a threshold below which turbulence is suppressed
beyond recovery.

deduce from it the KPZ formula. We also show that the full partition function

complying with the principles of special relativity and elementary causality.
At their classification we restrict ourselves to real mass and finite spinor
systems. It follows that (up to certain not yet discarded unitarily related
systems) the only irreducible causal systems are the Dirac and the Weyl
fermions. Their wave-equations are established as a mere consequence of causal
localization. - The bounded localized Dirac and Weyl wavefunctions are studied
in detail. One finds that, at the speed of light, the carriers shrink in the
past and expand in the future. For every direction in space there is a definite
time at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing
time characterizes those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in
the opposite direction. Using a density result for these late-change states one
shows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected to Lorentz
contraction. The latter is discussed in some detail. - We tackle the question
whether a causal system induces a representation of a causal logic and thus
provides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike
hyperplanes. The causal logic generated by the spacelike relation is shown to
do not admit representations at all. But the logic generated by the
non-timelike relation in general does, and the necessary condition is derived
that there is a projection valued measure on every non-timelike non-spacelike
hyperplane being the high boost limit of the localization on the spacelike
hyperplanes. Dirac and Weyl systems are shown to satisfy this condition and
thus to extend to all non-timelike hyperplanes, which implies more profound
properties of the causal systems. The bounded localized eigenstates of the
projections to non-spacelike flat strips are late-change states.

problems with smooth $\phi$-divergence penalties and smooth concave objective
functions, and develop a theory for data-driven calibration of the non-negative
""robustness parameter"" $\delta$ that controls the size of the deviations from
the nominal model. Building on the intuition that robust optimization reduces
the sensitivity of the expected reward to errors in the model by controlling
the spread of the reward distribution, we show that the first-order benefit of
``little bit of robustness"" (i.e., $\delta$ small, positive) is a significant
reduction in the variance of the out-of-sample reward while the corresponding
impact on the mean is almost an order of magnitude smaller. One implication is
that substantial variance (sensitivity) reduction is possible at little cost if
the robustness parameter is properly calibrated. To this end, we introduce the
notion of a robust mean-variance frontier to select the robustness parameter
and show that it can be approximated using resampling methods like the
bootstrap. Our examples show that robust solutions resulting from ""open loop""
calibration methods (e.g., selecting a $90\%$ confidence level regardless of
the data and objective function) can be very conservative out-of-sample, while
those corresponding to the robustness parameter that optimizes an estimate of
the out-of-sample expected reward (e.g., via the bootstrap) with no regard for
the variance are often insufficiently robust.

an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to
atmospheric models. To quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in
low-mass stars over the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical
information on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare
our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine
the spectroscopic RV information content, $Q$, and signal-to-noise ratio. We
find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be reached in the
wavelength range 700--900nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally
precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We demonstrate that
in this spectroscopic range, the large amount of absorption features
compensates for the intrinsic faintness of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision
of 1ms$^{-1}$ in very low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires
the use of a 10m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the
combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search
for low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar
variability. At a 4m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the
potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of

propose a novel point set registration method using the Gaussian mixture model

transformation model is defined as a combination of the similar transformation,
motion coherence, and the statistical shape model. Therefore, the proposed
method works effectively if the target point set includes outliers and missing

and therefore the method is scalable to large point sets. The effectiveness of
the method will be verified through comparisons with existing algorithms using

to an explosive production of hidden photons by tachyonic instability. We use
lattice simulations to evaluate the cosmological abundance of the QCD axion. In
doing so, we incorporate the backreaction of the produced hidden photons on the
axion dynamics, which becomes significant in the non-linear regime. We find
that the axion abundance is suppressed by at most ${\cal O}(10^{2})$ for the

For a sufficiently large coupling, the motion of the QCD axion becomes strongly
damped, and as a result, the axion abundance is enhanced. Our results show that
the cosmological upper bound on the axion decay constant can be relaxed by a
few hundred for a certain range of the coupling to hidden photons.

that instructors can achieve participation rates with online assessments

  In this paper, we leverage Gaussian Processes to investigate adversarial
examples in the framework of Bayesian inference. Across different models and
datasets, we find deviating levels of uncertainty reflect the perturbation
introduced to benign samples by state-of-the-art attacks, including novel
white-box attacks on Gaussian Processes. Our experiments demonstrate that even
unoptimized uncertainty thresholds already reject adversarial examples in many
scenarios.
  Comment: Thresholds can be broken in a modified attack, which was done in
arXiv:1812.02606 (The limitations of model uncertainty in adversarial
settings).

towers of ""1-soft-pion"" global Ward-Takahashi Identities (WTI), which govern
the $\phi$-sector, and represent a new global symmetry, $SU(2)_L\otimes$BRST, a
symmetry not of the Lagrangian but of the physical states. The first gives
relations among 1-$\phi$-I (but one $W^{\mu},B^{\mu}$ reducible) off-shell
Green's functions, the second governs on-shell T-matrix elements, replacing the
Adler self-consistency conditions. These WTI constrain the all-loop-orders

These on-shell WTI include a Lee-Stora-Symanzik (LSS) theorem, which enforces
the condition $m_{\pi}^2=0$ (far stronger than $m_{\tilde{\pi}}^2=0$) and
causes all relevant-operator contributions to the effective Lagrangian to
vanish exactly. The global $SU(2)_L$ and the BRST transformations commute in
$R_\xi$ gauges. With the on-shell T-matrix constraints, the physics therefore
has more symmetry than does its BRST invariant Lagrangian. We also show that

Boltzmann collision integral in the kinetic equation for 3D systems of

Balescu-Lenard-like collision term. However, the latter diverges at small
impact parameters. This comes from the fact that only weak interactions are
considered while strong collisions between close particles are neglected in its
derivation. We show that a solution to this dilemma exists in the framework of
the BBGKY formulation of statistical mechanics. It is based on a separate
treatment of the contribution of the strong interactions from that of the weak
interactions. The strong interaction part leads to a new term that involves a
fractional Laplacian operator in velocity space while the weak interaction
component yields the Balescu-Lenard collision term with an explained lower
cut-off at the Landau length. For spatially uniform initial conditions, the
fractional Laplacian contribution leads to a long-tailed velocity distribution
as long as the spatial inhomogeneity remains small. We present results from

instead has a fixed budget: the total amount of wages allocated by each
hospital to doctors is constrained. With budget constraints, stable matchings
may fail to exist and checking for the existence is hard. To deal with the
nonexistence of stable matchings, we extend the ""matching with contracts"" model
of Hatfield and Milgrom, so that it handles approximately stable matchings
where each of the hospitals' utilities after deviation can increase by factor
up to a certain amount. We then propose two novel mechanisms that efficiently
return such a stable matching that exactly satisfies the budget constraints. In
particular, by sacrificing strategy-proofness, our first mechanism achieves the
best possible bound. Furthermore, we find a special case such that a simple
mechanism is strategy-proof for doctors, keeping the best possible bound of the

object rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. The
problems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,
horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and perform
pick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case
where the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For
overlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of
pick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the
end-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize
the travel distance of the end-effector. While such problems do not involve all
the complexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hard in
both cases. This is shown through reductions from well-understood, hard
combinatorial challenges to these rearrangement problems. The reductions are
also shown to hold in the reverse direction, which enables the convenient
application on rearrangement of well studied algorithms. These algorithms can
be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The paper builds on
these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for dealing with the
rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation, including hardware-based
trials, shows that the proposed pipeline computes high-quality paths with
regards to the optimization objectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly
desirable scalability as the number of objects increases in both the

  Information","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1710.08277",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ergodic rate performance and limits of orthogonal frequency-division
multiple access (OFDMA) cognitive radios (CRs) is studied under imperfect
cross-link knowledge. We propose a novel stochastic interference management and
exploitation technique to mitigate and control the imposed interference by CRs
on licensed users in underlay spectrum sharing. The optimum downlink
channel-adaptive resource allocation (RA) algorithm is designed to maximize the
CRs functionality subject to the satisfying average transmit and probabilistic
peak interference power constraints. An expression of the cumulative density
function (cdf) of CRs' received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
is developed to evaluate the resultant ergodic rate. Simulation studies are
conducted to examine the proposed RA algorithm and investigate the impact of
parameters uncertainty on the overall system performance.

suffering from blunt force trauma, including co-morbidity. Methodology: The
Injury severity Score (ISS) is the default world standard for assessing the
severity of multiple injuries. ISS is a mathematical fit to empirical field
data. It is demonstrated that ISS is proportional to the Gibbs/Shannon Entropy.
A new Entropy measure of morbidity from blunt force trauma including
co-morbidity is derived based on the von Neumann Entropy, called the
Abbreviated Morbidity Scale (AMS). Results: The ISS trauma measure has been
applied to a previously published database, and good correlation has been
achieved. Here the existing trauma measure is extended to include the
co-morbidity of disease by calculating an Abbreviated Morbidity Score (AMS),
which encapsulates the disease co-morbidity in a manner analogous to AIS, and
on a consistent Entropy base. Applying Entropy measures to multiple injuries,
highlights the role of co-morbidity and that the elderly die at much lower
levels of injury than the general population, as a consequence of co-morbidity.
These considerations lead to questions regarding current new car assessment
protocols, and how well they protect the most vulnerable road users. Keywords:
Blunt Force Trauma, Injury Severity Score, Co-morbidity, Entropy.

customers to that restaurant. The word of mouth has been systematically
replaced with the online reviews. It gives a sense of satisfaction for people
to know beforehand about the number of average stars the restaurant has
acquired before stepping into a restaurant. However, these ratings are
indirectly biased based on the location, amenities, and the perception of
individual people. In this work, we analyze the ratings of restaurants
available through the Yelp public data for the discrepancies in the rating
system and attempt to provide an optimized global rating system. For a frequent
visitor to a high- end restaurant with lavish amenities, even a slightest of
reduction in the expected ambiance may prompt a 4 star rating, while a
restaurant, which guarantees a minimum taste for its food, may get a 5 star
rating. These discrepancies can often be attributed to three factors- the
perspective of individual people, features of the restaurant and Location. The
perspective of individual people is always subjective and what seems good for
one person may be poor for another. In this work, we focus on the other two
important factors, Reviews and the features.

unraveling the true potential of plasmonics by exploiting an enhanced native

directly translate the information encoded in the amplitude and phase of the

execute instructions from a group of consecutive threads, called warps. At each
cycle, an SM schedules a warp from a group of active warps and can context
switch among the active warps to hide various stalls. Hence the performance of
warp scheduler is critical to the performance of GPU. Several heuristic warp
scheduling algorithms have been proposed which work well only for the
situations they are designed for. GPU workloads are becoming very diverse in
nature and hence one heuristic may not work for all cases. To work well over a
diverse range of workloads, which might exhibit hitherto unseen
characteristics, a warp scheduling algorithm must be able to adapt on-line.
  We propose a Reinforcement Learning based Warp Scheduler (RLWS) which learns
to schedule warps based on the current state of the core and the long-term
benefits of scheduling actions, adapting not only to different types of
workloads, but also to different execution phases in each workload. As the
design space involving the state variables and the parameters (such as learning
and exploration rates, reward and penalty values) used by RLWS is large, we use
Genetic Algorithm to identify the useful subset of state variables and
parameter values. We evaluated the proposed RLWS using the GPGPU-SIM simulator
on a large number of workloads from the Rodinia, Parboil, CUDA-SDK and
GPGPU-SIM benchmark suites and compared with other state-of-the-art warp
scheduling methods. Our RL based implementation achieved either the best or
very close to the best performance in 80\% of kernels with an average speedup
