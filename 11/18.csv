approaches may be particularly appealing in this field, as they promise to
optimize complex multi-material machines with very little or no human
intervention. Evolutionary soft robotics is concerned with the application of
optimization algorithms inspired by natural evolution in order to let soft
robots (both morphologies and controllers) spontaneously evolve within
physically-realistic simulated environments, figuring out how to satisfy a set
of objectives defined by human designers. In this paper a powerful evolutionary
system is put in place in order to perform a broad investigation on the
free-form evolution of walking and swimming soft robots in different
environments. Three sets of experiments are reported, tackling different
aspects of the evolution of soft locomotion. The first two sets explore the
effects of different material properties on the evolution of terrestrial and
aquatic soft locomotion: particularly, we show how different materials lead to
the evolution of different morphologies, behaviors, and energy-performance
tradeoffs. It is found that within our simplified physics world stiffer robots
evolve more sophisticated and effective gaits and morphologies on land, while
softer ones tend to perform better in water. The third set of experiments
starts investigating the effect and potential benefits of major environmental
transitions (land - water) during evolution. Results provide interesting
morphological exaptation phenomena, and point out a potential asymmetry between
land-water and water-land transitions: while the first type of transition
appears to be detrimental, the second one seems to have some beneficial
effects.

annotated datasets are required for training. Such datasets are difficult to
acquire because labeled medical images are not usually available due to privacy
issues, lack of experts available for annotation, underrepresentation of rare
conditions and poor standardization. Lack of annotated data has been addressed
in conventional vision applications using synthetic images refined via
unsupervised adversarial training to look like real images. However, this
approach is difficult to extend to general medical imaging because of the
complex and diverse set of features found in real human tissues. We propose an
alternative framework that uses a reverse flow, where adversarial training is
used to make real medical images more like synthetic images, and hypothesize
that clinically-relevant features can be preserved via self-regularization.
These domain-adapted images can then be accurately interpreted by networks
trained on large datasets of synthetic medical images. We test this approach
for the notoriously difficult task of depth-estimation from endoscopy. We train
a depth estimator on a large dataset of synthetic images generated using an
accurate forward model of an endoscope and an anatomically-realistic colon.
This network predicts significantly better depths when using synthetic-like
domain-adapted images compared to the real images, confirming that the
clinically-relevant features of depth are preserved.

machines improves the scalability of graph database management systems.
However, these systems will incur additional network cost during the execution
of a query workload, due to inter-partition traversals. Workload-agnostic
partitioning algorithms typically minimise the likelihood of any edge crossing
partition boundaries. However, these partitioners are sub-optimal with respect
to many workloads, especially queries, which may require more frequent
traversal of specific subsets of inter-partition edges. Furthermore, they
largely unsuited to operating incrementally on dynamic, growing graphs.
  We present a new graph partitioning algorithm, Loom, that operates on a
stream of graph updates and continuously allocates the new vertices and edges
to partitions, taking into account a query workload of graph pattern
expressions along with their relative frequencies.
  First we capture the most common patterns of edge traversals which occur when
executing queries. We then compare sub-graphs, which present themselves
incrementally in the graph update stream, against these common patterns.
Finally we attempt to allocate each match to single partitions, reducing the
number of inter-partition edges within frequently traversed sub-graphs and
improving average query performance.
  Loom is extensively evaluated over several large test graphs with realistic
query workloads and various orderings of the graph updates. We demonstrate
that, given a workload, our prototype produces partitionings of significantly
better quality than existing streaming graph partitioning algorithms Fennel and
LDG.

the $r$-process and on the nature of dense matter. A set of realistic models of
the equation of state (EOS) that yield an accurate description of the
properties of finite nuclei, support neutron stars of two solar masses, and
provide a Lorentz covariant extrapolation to dense matter are used to confront
its predictions against tidal polarizabilities extracted from the
gravitational-wave data. Given the sensitivity of the gravitational-wave signal
to the underlying EOS, limits on the tidal polarizability inferred from the
observation translate into constraints on the neutron-star radius. Based on
these constraints, models that predict a stiff symmetry energy, and thus large
stellar radii, can be ruled out. Indeed, we deduce an upper limit on the radius
of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star of $R_{\star}^{1.4}\!<\!13.76\,{\rm km}$.
Given the sensitivity of the neutron-skin thickness of ${}^{208}$Pb to the
symmetry energy, albeit at a lower density, we infer a corresponding upper
limit of about $R_{\rm skin}^{208}\!\lesssim\!0.25\,{\rm fm}$. However, if the
upcoming PREX-II experiment measures a significantly thicker skin, this may be
evidence of a softening of the symmetry energy at high densities---likely
indicative of a phase transition in the interior of neutron stars.

-stable $r$-uniform Kneser hypergraphs is equal to $\left\lceil \frac{n-\max

conjecture proposed by Ziegler (2002), and Alon, Drewnowski and \L uczak
(2009). The problem about the chromatic number of almost $s$-stable $r$
-uniform Kneser hypergraphs has also been introduced by Meunier (2011).
  For the $r=2$ case of the Meunier conjecture, Jonsson (2012) provided a
purely combinatorial proof to confirm the conjecture for $s\geq 4$ and $n$
sufficiently large, and by Chen (2015) for even $s$ and any $n$. The case $
s=3$ is completely open, even the chromatic number of the usual almost $s$
-stable Kneser graphs.
  In this paper, we obtain a topological lower bound for the chromatic number
of almost $s$-stable $r$-uniform Kneser hypergraphs via a different approach.
For the case $r=2$, we conclude that the chromatic number of almost $s$-stable
Kneser graphs is equal to $n-s(k-1)$ for all $s\geq 2$. Set $t=n-s(k-1)$. We
show that any proper coloring of an almost $s$-stable Kneser graph must contain
a completely multicolored complete bipartite subgraph $K_{\left\lceil

that the local chromatic number of almost $s$ -stable Kneser graphs is at least
$\left\lceil \frac{t}{2}\right\rceil +1$. It is a strengthened result of
Simonyi and Tardos (2007), and Meunier's (2014) lower bound for almost

interaction by bringing the system to the vicinity of a scattering resonance.
Although this has been a focused topic in cold atom physics for more than a
decade, these studies have so far mostly been limited for $s$-wave resonance.
Here we report the experimental observation of a broad $d$-wave shape resonance

that splits into three branches as a hallmark of $d$-wave molecules, and find
that the lifetime of this many-body system is reasonably long at strongly

input image, which we use to train a deep convolutional network. At run-time we
use the predicted ephemerality and depth as an input to a monocular visual
odometry (VO) pipeline, using either sparse features or dense photometric
matching. Our approach yields metric-scale VO using only a single camera and
can recover the correct egomotion even when 90% of the image is obscured by
dynamic, independently moving objects. We evaluate our robust VO methods on
more than 400km of driving from the Oxford RobotCar Dataset and demonstrate
reduced odometry drift and significantly improved egomotion estimation in the

cylinder flow at Reynolds number 525 and Mach number 0.1. By computing the
first 40 Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs), we find that unstable CLVs are
active in the near-wake region, whereas stable CLVs are active in the far-wake
region. This phenomenon is related to hyperbolicity since it shows that CLVs
point to different directions; it also suggests that for open flows there is a
large fraction of CLVs that are stable. However, due to the extra neutral CLV
and the occasional tangencies between CLVs, our system is not uniform
hyperbolic. By the Non-intrusive least-squares shadowing (NILSS) algorithm, we
compute shadowing directions and sensitivities of long-time-averaged
objectives. Our results suggest that shadowing methods may be valid for general

to deal with the user modeling problem is to manually extract all kinds of
aggregated features over the heterogeneous behaviors, which may fail to fully
represent the data itself due to limited human instinct. Recent works usually
use RNN-based methods to give an overall embedding of a behavior sequence,
which then could be exploited by the downstream applications. However, this can
only preserve very limited information, or aggregated memories of a person.
When a downstream application requires to facilitate the modeled user features,
it may lose the integrity of the specific highly correlated behavior of the
user, and introduce noises derived from unrelated behaviors. This paper
proposes an attention based user behavior modeling framework called ATRank,
which we mainly use for recommendation tasks. Heterogeneous user behaviors are
considered in our model that we project all types of behaviors into multiple
latent semantic spaces, where influence can be made among the behaviors via
self-attention. Downstream applications then can use the user behavior vectors
via vanilla attention. Experiments show that ATRank can achieve better
performance and faster training process. We further explore ATRank to use one
unified model to predict different types of user behaviors at the same time,
showing a comparable performance with the highly optimized individual models.

find that, in the case of the recovery time $\tau_R$ is larger than the
infection time $\tau_I$, the infection will flow directionally from the
ancestors to the descendants however, the descendants will not able to reinfect
their ancestors during their infection time. This behavior leads us to deduce
that, for this case and when the infection rate $\lambda$ is high enough in
such that, any infected node on the network infects all of its neighbors during
its infection time, SIRS model on the network evolves to extinction state,
where all the nodes on the network become susceptible. Moreover, we assert
that, in order to the infection occurs repeatedly inside the network, the loops
on the network are necessary, which means the clustering coefficient will play
an important role for this model. Hence, unlike the other models such as SIS
model and SIR model, SIRS model has a two critical threshold which separate the
persistence phase from the extinction phase when $\tau_I<\tau_R$. That means,
for fixed values of $\tau_I$ and $\tau_R$ there are a two critical points for

the orthogonal transformation by taking one observed data point at a time.
Existing works on the convergence of (subspace) online PCA iterations mostly
focus on the case where sample are almost surely uniformly bounded. In this
paper, we analyze the convergence of a subspace online PCA iteration under more
practical assumption and obtain a nearly optimal finite-sample error bound. Our
convergence rate almost matches the minimax information lower bound. We prove
that the convergence is nearly global in the sense that the subspace online PCA

between fragments (back-to-back). Protonated fragments exhibit a distinct
kinematic correlation, indicating a delay between ionization and fragmentation

However, it was recently found that the reduction of residual out-of-plane

to a superconducting phase. Here we use a recently developed first principles
method to explore how displacement of the apical oxygen (A-O) in LCO affects
the optical gap, spin and charge susceptibilities, and superconducting order
parameter. By combining quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QS\emph{GW}) and
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), that LCO is a Mott insulator; but small
displacements of the apical oxygens drive the compound to a metallic state

the deep physical reasons why the behaviour of NCO is so different than the
hole doped materials. We shed new light on the recent correlation observed

enhanced by a factor of 5 or more compared to the neighboring O IV 1401.2 A,
contrary to predictions of ionization equilibrium models and the Maxwellian
distribution of particle energies. Non-equilibrium effects in TR spectra are
therefore expected. To investigate the combination of non-equilibrium
ionization and high-energy particles, we apply the model of the periodic
electron beam, represented by a kappa-distribution that recurs at periods of
several seconds, to plasma at chromospheric temperatures of 10^4 K. This simple
model can approximate a burst of energy release involving accelerated
particles. Instantaneous time-dependent charge states of silicon and oxygen
were calculated and used to synthesize the instantaneous and period-averaged
spectra of Si IV and O IV. The electron beam drives the plasma out of
equilibrium. At electron densities of N_e = 10^10 cm^-3, the plasma is out of
ionization equilibrium at all times in all cases we considered, while for a
higher density of N_e = 10^11 cm^-3, ionization equilibrium can be reached
toward the end of each period, depending on the conditions. In turn, the
character of the period-averaged synthetic spectra also depends on the
properties of the beam. While the case of kappa = 2 results in spectra with
strong or even dominant O IV, higher values of kappa can approximate a range of
observed TR spectra. Spectra similar to typically observed spectra, with the Si
IV 1402.8 A line about a factor 5 higher than O IV 1401.2 A, are obtained for
kappa = 3. An even higher value of kappa = 5 results in spectra that are
exclusively dominated by Si IV, with negligible O IV emission. This is a
possible interpretation of the TR spectra of UV bursts, although an
interpretation that requires a density that is 1-3 orders of magnitude lower
than for equilibrium estimates.

entangled. Here we build a theory to understand the energy cost of entanglement
extraction. First, we apply it to a toy model, and then we define the
entanglement temperature, which relates the energy cost to the amount of

cost of entanglement extraction in some condensed matter and quantum field

space of the theory. Recently, extensions of Horndeski theory, which are free
from Ostrogradsky ghosts despite the presence of higher order derivatives in
the equations of motion, have been identified and classified exploiting the
degeneracy criterium. In these new theories, the fifth force mediated by the

variously described as being due to line-of-sight effects of the Galactic warp
and flare or of extragalactic origin (via accretion). Despite being intensely
scrutinised in the literature for more than a decade, no studies to-date have
been able to definitively uncover its origins. Here we use $N$-body simulations
and a genetic algorithm to explore the parameter space for the initial
position, orbital parameters and, for the first time, the final location of a
satellite progenitor. We fit our models to the latest Pan-STARRS data to
determine whether an accretion scenario is capable of producing an in- Plane
ring-like structure matching the known parameters of the MRi. Our simulations
produce streams that closely match the location, proper motion and kinematics
of the MRi structure. However, we are not able to reproduce the mass estimates
from earlier studies based on Pan-STARRS data. Furthermore, in contrast with
earlier studies our best-fit models are those for progenitors on retrograde
orbits. If the MRi was produced by satellite accretion, we find that its
progenitor has an initial mass upper limit of ~$10^{10}$M$_\odot$ and the
remnant is likely located behind the Galactic bulge, making it diffcult to
locate observationally. While our models produce realistic MRi-like structures
we cannot definitively conclude that the MRi was produced by the accretion of a
satellite galaxy.

remove several percent of a planet's H/He envelope by mass; in many cases, this
removal results in bare rocky cores, many of which situated in the habitable
zones (HZs) of G-type stars. The erosion of sub-Neptune sized planets may be
one of the most prevalent channels by which terrestrial super-Earths are
created near the Galactic Center. As such, the planet population demographics
may be quite different close to Sgr A$^*$ than in the Galaxy's outskirts. The
high stellar densities in this region (about seven orders of magnitude greater
than the solar neighborhood) imply that the distance between neighboring rocky
worlds is short ($500-5000$~AU). The proximity between potentially habitable
terrestrial planets may enable the onset of widespread interstellar panspermia
near the nuclei of galaxies. More generally, we predict these phenomena to be
ubiquitous for planets in nuclear star clusters and ultra-compact dwarfs.
Globular clusters, on the other hand, are less affected by the black holes.

populations of local early-type galaxies encode the assembly history of
galaxies over cosmic time. We use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical

track how the morphological mix of their progenitors evolves over time. We
provide a framework for alleviating `progenitor bias' -- the bias that occurs
if one uses only early-type galaxies to study the progenitor population.
Early-types attain their final morphology at relatively early epochs -- by
$z\sim1$, around 60 per cent of today's early-types have had their last
significant merger. At all redshifts, the majority of mergers have one
late-type progenitor, with late-late mergers dominating at $z>1.5$ and
early-early mergers becoming significant only at $z<0.5$. Progenitor bias is
severe at all but the lowest redshifts -- e.g. at $z\sim0.6$, less than 50 per
cent of the stellar mass in today's early-types is actually in progenitors with
early-type morphology, while, at $z\sim2$, studying only early-types misses
almost all (80 per cent) of the stellar mass that eventually ends up in local
early-type systems. At high redshift, almost all massive late-type galaxies,
regardless of their local environment or star-formation rate, are progenitors
of local early-type galaxies, as are lower-mass (M$_\star$ $<$ 10$^{10.5}$
M$_{\odot}$) late-types as long as they reside in high density environments. In
this new era of large observational surveys (e.g. LSST, JWST), this study
provides a framework for studying how today's early-type galaxies have been
built up over cosmic time.

variable subsets with high prediction power. Most fitness measures used by
these genetic algorithms are based on the ordinary least-squares fit of the
resulting model to the entire data or a subset thereof. Due to
multicollinearity, partial least squares regression is often more appropriate,
but rarely considered in genetic algorithms due to the additional cost for
estimating the optimal number of components. We introduce two novel fitness
measures for genetic algorithms, explicitly designed to estimate the internal
prediction performance of partial least squares regression models built from
the variable subsets. Both measures estimate the optimal number of components
using cross-validation and subsequently estimate the prediction performance by
predicting the response of observations not included in model-fitting. This is
repeated multiple times to estimate the measures' variations due to different
random splits. Moreover, one measure was optimized for speed and more accurate
estimation of the prediction performance for observations not included during
variable selection. This leads to variable subsets with high internal and
external prediction power. Results on high-dimensional chemical-analytical data
show that the variable subsets acquired by this approach have competitive
internal prediction power and superior external prediction power compared to
variable subsets extracted with other fitness measures.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, which deals with the
interaction of electromagnetic radiation with nuclei in a magnetic field and
possessing a fundamental quantum mechanical property called spin.
Orientation-dependent interactions in ssNMR, while offering a wealth of
information, lead to broad indistinct signal and therefore are averaged out,
predominantly by Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS). Reintroduction of the coupling
interactions is achieved through radio frequency recoupling pulse sequences.
NMR experiments are in general understood by finding the effective Hamiltonian,
which best approximates the spin dynamics and is found using average
Hamiltonian theory (AHT) or the Floquet theory, the former is the popular
approach. The two theories yield the same effective Hamiltonian, valid for
stroboscopic observations. Generalised expressions, for the effective
Hamiltonian using AHT, are derived in the frequency domain in this dissertation
to allow for appreciation of the equivalence with Floquet theory-mediated
effective Hamiltonian. The derivation relies on the ability to express the time
dependency of the interactions with a finite set of fundamental frequencies,
which has long been sought and the lack of which has, at times, been
misunderstood as limitations of AHT. A formalism to represent any periodic
time-dependent interaction in the Fourier space with no more than two

for the computation of effective Hamiltonian for any pulsed experiment. The

$z_i$ is the sum of the volumes of all $d$-simplices of $T$ having $v^i \in V$
as a vertex. It is clear that given $V$ and a triangulation $T$ we can find
$\phi(T)$. The focus of this paper is recovering a lexicographic triangulation
from its GKZ-vector.
  The motivation for studying triangulations and their GKZ-vectors arises from
the work of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinski\v{\i} in which they illuminate
connections between regular triangulations and subdivisions of Newton
polytopes, and generalized discriminants and determinants.
  The secondary polytope, $\Sigma (V)$, of an arbitrary finite point set $V
\subset \mathbb R^d$, introduced by Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinski\v{\i},
is defined to be the convex hull of the GKZ-vectors of all triangulations of
$V$. They showed the vertices of $\Sigma (V)$ are in one-to-one correspondence
with the regular triangulations of $V$. Since the GKZ-vector of a regular
triangulation is uniquely associated with that triangulation, a natural
question is how that triangulation can be recovered from its vector. We answer
this question in the case that the associated triangulation is lexicographic.

demonstrate a simple, yet complete work-chain that allows for the conversion of

identification errors, and the inter-operator variance within APT experiments.
This work chain is compared to current procedures via experimental trials with
different APT operators, to determine the relative effectiveness and precision
of the two approaches. It is found that there is little loss of precision (and
occasionally gain) when participants are given computer assistance. We find
that in either case, inter-operator precision for ranging varies between 0 and
2 ""significant figures"" (2{\sigma} confidence in the first n digits of the

optimal procedure to combine the denoised outputs via convex optimization; (2)
A deep neural network to estimate the mean squared error (MSE) of denoised
images without needing the ground truths; (3) An image boosting procedure using
a deep neural network to improve contrast and to recover lost details of the
combined images. Experimental results show that CsNet can consistently improve
denoising performance for both deterministic and neural network denoisers.

trees. One way to approach this problem, known as the supertree method,
involves inferring a phylogenetic tree with leaves consisting of a set $X$ of
species from a collection of trees, each having leaf-set some subset of $X$. In
the 1980's characterizations, certain inference rules were given for when a
collection of 4-leaved trees, one for each 4-element subset of $X$, can all be
simultaneously displayed by a single supertree with leaf-set $X$. Recently, it
has become of interest to extend such results to phylogenetic networks. These
are a generalization of phylogenetic trees which can be used to represent
reticulate evolution (where species can come together to form a new species).
It has been shown that a certain type of phylogenetic network, called a level-1
network, can essentially be constructed from 4-leaved trees. However, the
problem of providing appropriate inference rules for such networks remains
unresolved. Here we show that by considering 4-leaved networks, called
quarnets, as opposed to 4-leaved trees, it is possible to provide such rules.
In particular, we show that these rules can be used to characterize when a
collection of quarnets, one for each 4-element subset of $X$, can all be
simultaneously displayed by a level-1 network with leaf-set $X$. The rules are
an intriguing mixture of tree inference rules, and an inference rule for
building up a cyclic ordering of $X$ from orderings on subsets of $X$ of size
4. This opens up several new directions of research for inferring phylogenetic
networks from smaller ones, which could yield new algorithms for solving the
supernetwork problem in phylogenetics.

based on the assumption that the porous media can be represented by a bundle of
capillary tubes with throats or ""ink-bottles"" and a fractal pore size
distribution. Under these hypotheses, hysteretic curves are obtained for
saturation and relative hydraulic conductivity in terms of pressure head.
However, a non-hysteretic relationship is obtained when relative hydraulic
conductivity is expressed as a function of saturation. The proposed
relationship between permeability and porosity is similar to the well-known
Kozeny-Carman equation but depends on the fractal dimension. The performance of
the constitutive model is tested against different sets of experimental data

within the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to their center of mass energy,
then a black hole will form. Despite a large body of work on the formation of
primordial black holes, so far this conjecture has not been generalized to
expanding spacetimes. We derive a formula which gives the distance within which
two particles must be localized to give a black hole, and which crucially
depends on the expansion rate of the background space. In the limit of a very
slow expansion, we recover the flat spacetime case. In the opposite limit of
the large expansion rate when the inverse Hubble radius is smaller than the
Schwarzschild radius of a ""would be"" black hole, the new critical distance
between two particles that can make a black hole becomes equal to the particle
horizon, which is just a requirement that the particles are in a causal

turbulent, star-forming clouds to analyze the detailed interaction between
non-ionizing UV radiation and the cloud material. Our simulations trace the
evolution of gas and star particles through self-gravitating collapse, star
formation, and cloud destruction via radiation-driven outflows. These models
are idealized in that we include only radiation feedback and adopt an
isothermal equation of state. Turbulence creates a structure of dense filaments
and large holes through which radiation escapes, such that only ~50% of the
radiation is (cumulatively) absorbed by the end of star formation. The surface
density distribution of gas by mass as seen by the central cluster is roughly
lognormal with sigma_ln(Sigma) = 1.3-1.7, similar to the externally-projected
surface density distribution. This allows low surface density regions to be
driven outwards to nearly 10 times their initial escape speed v_esc. Although
the velocity distribution of outflows is broadened by the lognormal surface
density distribution, the overall efficiency of momentum injection to the gas
cloud is reduced because much of the radiation escapes. The mean outflow
velocity is approximately twice the escape speed from the initial cloud radius.
Our results are also informative for understanding galactic-scale wind driving
by radiation, in particular the relationship between velocity and surface
density for individual outflow structures, and the resulting velocity and mass
distributions arising from turbulent sources.

brings through the excited states up to the closest approach point. There
released, the projectile is trapped into a primary, highly excited state in the
continuum. The lifetime of the primary state depends on the multipolarity of
the deformed projectile. At intermediate energy the collision is a sudden
reaction, the valence neutron may stay --- during the impact --- in the forward

gets prolate or oblate, dipole or multipole deformation and the nucleus gets
single-particle or collective excitation. The primary excited states,

Chandra-HETGS spectroscopy at orbital phase ~0.25, when our line of sight
towards the source does not pass through the large-scale accretion structure
such as the accretion wake, we observe changes in overall spectral shape on
timescales of a few kiloseconds. This spectral variability is, at least in

variable absorption cannot be caused by unperturbed clumpy winds of O/B stars.
We detect line features from high and low ionization species of silicon,
magnesium and neon whose strengths and presence depend on the overall level of

most crucial online places for political debate. Most of the previous studies
focus on the formal structure of the Twitter political field, such as its
homophilic tendency, or otherwise limit the analysis to a few topics. In order
to explore whether Twitter functions as an echo chamber in general, however, we
have to investigate not only the structure but also the contents of Twitter's
political field. Accordingly, we conducted both large-scale social network
analysis and natural language processing. We firstly applied a community
detection method to the reciprocal following network in Twitter and found five
politically distinct communities in the field. We further examined dominant
topics discussed therein by employing a topic model in analyzing the content of
the tweets, and we found that a topic related to xenophobia is circulated
solely in right-wing communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
address echo chambers in Japanese Twitter political field and to examine the
formal structure and the contents of tweets with the combination of large-scale
social network analysis and natural language processing.

localisation with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We first compare and
analyse different loss functions including L2, L1 and smooth L1. The analysis
of these loss functions suggests that, for the training of a CNN-based
localisation model, more attention should be paid to small and medium range
errors. To this end, we design a piece-wise loss function. The new loss
amplifies the impact of errors from the interval (-w, w) by switching from L1
loss to a modified logarithm function.
  To address the problem of under-representation of samples with large
out-of-plane head rotations in the training set, we propose a simple but
effective boosting strategy, referred to as pose-based data balancing. In
particular, we deal with the data imbalance problem by duplicating the minority
training samples and perturbing them by injecting random image rotation,
bounding box translation and other data augmentation approaches. Last, the
proposed approach is extended to create a two-stage framework for robust facial
landmark localisation. The experimental results obtained on AFLW and 300W
demonstrate the merits of the Wing loss function, and prove the superiority of
the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

high-quality hierarchical features in deep networks. Updating the features or
weights in one layer, however, requires waiting for the propagation of error
signals from higher layers. Learning using delayed and non-local errors makes
it hard to reconcile backpropagation with the learning mechanisms observed in
biological neural networks as it requires the neurons to maintain a memory of
the input long enough until the higher-layer errors arrive. In this paper, we
propose an alternative learning mechanism where errors are generated locally in
each layer using fixed, random auxiliary classifiers. Lower layers could thus
be trained independently of higher layers and training could either proceed
layer by layer, or simultaneously in all layers using local error information.
We address biological plausibility concerns such as weight symmetry
requirements and show that the proposed learning mechanism based on fixed,
broad, and random tuning of each neuron to the classification categories
outperforms the biologically-motivated feedback alignment learning technique on
the MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets, approaching the performance of standard
backpropagation. Our approach highlights a potential biological mechanism for
the supervised, or task-dependent, learning of feature hierarchies. In

can reduce the ensemble size required to avoid collapse in particle filtering
of spatially-extended dynamics and improve the resulting uncertainty
quantification at large scales. Particle filter weights depend on how well
ensemble members agree with observations, and collapse occurs when a few
ensemble members receive most of the weight. Collapse causes catastrophic
variance underestimation. Increasing small-scale variance in the observation
error model reduces the incidence of collapse by de-emphasizing small-scale
differences between the ensemble members and the observations. Doing so smooths
the posterior mean, though it does not smooth the individual ensemble members.
Two options for implementing the proposed observation error model are
described. Taking discretized elliptic differential operators as an observation
error covariance matrix provides the desired property of a spectrum that grows
in the approach to small scales. This choice also introduces structure
exploitable by scalable computation techniques, including multigrid solvers and
multiresolution approximations to the corresponding integral operator.
Alternatively the observations can be smoothed and then assimilated under the
assumption of independent errors, which is equivalent to assuming large errors
at small scales. The method is demonstrated on a linear stochastic partial
differential equation, where it significantly reduces the occurrence of
particle filter collapse while maintaining accuracy. It also improves
continuous ranked probability scores by as much as 25%, indicating that the
weighted ensemble more accurately represents the true distribution. The method
is compatible with other techniques for improving the performance of particle
filters.

terminal positions, we obtain the so-called {\em deterministic graphical}(DG)

terminal positions and one special outcome $c$ that is assigned to all infinite

games. However, by doing so, we lose two important properties: the modified
algorithm always outputs a {\em Nash equilibrium} (NE) only when $n = 2$ and,
even in this case, this NE may be not {\em subgame perfect}. (Yet, in the
zero-sum case it is.) The lack of these two properties is not a fault of the

Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the convergence characteristics can be
significantly improved through the incorporation of memetics (local solution
refinements as a form of lifelong learning), as a promising means of mitigating
(or at least suppressing) the Red Queen phenomenon by providing a guiding hand
to the purely genetic mechanisms of co-evolution. Our practical motivation is
to address MOGs of a time-sensitive nature that are characterized by
computationally expensive evaluations, wherein there is a natural need to
reduce the total number of true function evaluations consumed in achieving good
quality solutions. To this end, we propose novel enhancements to
co-evolutionary approaches for tackling MOGs, such that memetic local
refinements can be efficiently applied on evolved candidate strategies by
searching on computationally cheap surrogate payoff landscapes (that preserve
postponed preference conditions). The efficacy of the proposal is demonstrated
on a suite of test MOGs that have been designed.

Coding-theoretic techniques have been recently proposed to mitigate stragglers

inexact solutions can be acceptable in applications that are robust to noise,

\times X_n \rightarrow A$, where $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, and $A$ are arbitrary
finite sets. Function $g$ is called {\em separable} if there exist $n$
functions $g_i : X_i \rightarrow A$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, such that for every
input $x_1, \ldots ,x_n$ the function $g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ takes one of the
values $g_1(x_1), \ldots ,g_n(x_n)$. Given a discrete function $g$, it is an
interesting problem to ask whether $g$ is separable or not. Although this seems
to be a very basic problem concerning discrete functions, the complexity of
recognition of separable discrete functions of $n$ variables is known only for
$n=2$. In this paper we will show that a slightly more general recognition
problem, when $g$ is not fully but only partially defined, is NP-complete for
$n \geq 3$. We will then use this result to show that the recognition of fully
defined separable discrete functions is NP-complete for $n \geq 4$.
  The case $n = 2$ is well-studied in the context of game theory, where
(separable) discrete functions of $n$ variables are referred to as (assignable)
$n$-person game forms. There is a known sufficient condition for assignability
(separability) of two-person game forms (discrete functions of two variables)
called (weak) total tightness of a game form. This property can be tested in
polynomial time, and can be easily generalized both to higher dimension and to
partially defined functions. We will prove in this paper that weak total
tightness implies separability for (partially defined) discrete functions of
$n$ variables for any $n$, thus generalizing the above result known for $n=2$.

the velocity perturbation field. However, the pressure perturbation field is
not directly accessible in laboratory or field observations. Previously, a
Green's function based method was developed to calculate the instantaneous
energy flux field from a measured density perturbation field $\rho(x,z,t)$,
given a $constant$ buoyancy frequency $N$. Here we present methods for
computing the instantaneous energy flux $\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$ for a spatially

To generalize this approach to $arbitrary$ $N(z)$, we present a computational
method for obtaining $\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$. The results for $\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$

decay by bubble nucleation of a Minkowski or AdS false vacuum. In their
thin-wall approximation this happens whenever the surface tension in the bubble
wall exceeds an upper bound proportional to the difference of the square roots
of the true and false vacuum energy densities. Recently it was shown that there
is another type of thin-wall regime that differs from that of CDL in that the
radius of curvature grows substantially as one moves through the wall. Not only
does the CDL derivation of the bound fail in this case, but also its very
formulation becomes ambiguous because the surface tension is not well-defined.
We propose a definition of the surface tension and show that it obeys a bound
similar in form to that of the CDL case. We then show that both thin-wall
bounds are special cases of a more general bound that is satisfied for all
bounce solutions with Minkowski or AdS false vacua. We discuss the limit where
the parameters of the theory attain critical values and the bound is saturated.
The bounce solution then disappears and a static planar domain wall solution
appears in its stead. The scalar field potential then is of the form expected

optimally seeding the predator cascade over time to minimize the harmful prey

influences whether plate tectonics can take place on a planet, with cool
climates being favorable for plate tectonics because they enhance stresses in
the lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing, and promote hydration and
weakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics plays a vital role in the
long-term carbon cycle, which helps to maintain a temperate climate. Plate
tectonics provides long-term cooling of the core, which is vital for generating
a magnetic field, and the magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric
volatiles from the solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can
potentially explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies
too close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon
cycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore plate tectonics cannot
operate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to insufficient
core cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where liquid water is
possible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can take place depending on
initial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile content, or the timing of when
plate tectonics initiates, among other factors. Many of these evolutionary
trajectories would render the planet uninhabitable. However, there is still
significant uncertainty over the nature of the coupling between climate,
mantle, and core. Future work is needed to constrain potential evolutionary
scenarios and the likelihood of an Earth-like evolution.

and parameter regularization---which together reduce the extent to which the
model is over-fitted to match the idiosyncracies of observed survey data. The
automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development
setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the
costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed
to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after
data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the
model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that
may be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data
from Zambia, the model's out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households
from non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.

neurological movement disorders, which can significantly degrade quality of

importance because of its application in assistive and rehabilitative devices.
In this paper, we propose a novel on-line adaptive method which can adjust the
hyper-parameters of the filter to the variable characteristics of the tremor.
The proposed ""WAKE: Wavelet decomposition coupled with Adaptive Kalman

framework"" is composed of a new adaptive Kalman filter and a wavelet transform
core to provide indirect prediction of the tremor, one sample ahead of time, to
be used for its suppression. In this paper, the design, implementation and
evaluation of WAKE are given. The performance is evaluated based on three
different datasets, the first one is a synthetic dataset, developed in this
work, that simulates hand tremor under ten different conditions. The second and
third ones are real datasets recorded from patients with PHTs. The results
obtained from the proposed WAKE framework demonstrate significant improvements
in the estimation accuracy in comparison with two well regarded techniques in

applications. The representation of spatial knowledge is often modeled with
spatial templates, i.e., regions of acceptability of two objects under an
explicit spatial relationship (e.g., ""on"", ""below"", etc.). In contrast with
prior work that restricts spatial templates to explicit spatial prepositions
(e.g., ""glass on table""), here we extend this concept to implicit spatial
language, i.e., those relationships (generally actions) for which the spatial
arrangement of the objects is only implicitly implied (e.g., ""man riding
horse""). In contrast with explicit relationships, predicting spatial
arrangements from implicit spatial language requires significant common sense
spatial understanding. Here, we introduce the task of predicting spatial
templates for two objects under a relationship, which can be seen as a spatial
question-answering task with a (2D) continuous output (""where is the man w.r.t.
a horse when the man is walking the horse?""). We present two simple
neural-based models that leverage annotated images and structured text to learn
this task. The good performance of these models reveals that spatial locations
are to a large extent predictable from implicit spatial language. Crucially,
the models attain similar performance in a challenging generalized setting,
where the object-relation-object combinations (e.g.,""man walking dog"") have
never been seen before. Next, we go one step further by presenting the models
with unseen objects (e.g., ""dog""). In this scenario, we show that leveraging
word embeddings enables the models to output accurate spatial predictions,
proving that the models acquire solid common sense spatial knowledge allowing
for such generalization.

$\infty$ is inaccessible, it is always an entrance boundary. In the case where
$\infty$ is accessible, explosion can occur either by a single jump to $\infty$
(the process at $z$ jumps to $\infty$ at rate $\lambda z$ for some $\lambda>0$)
or by accumulation of large jumps over finite intervals. We construct a natural
extension of the minimal process and show that when $\infty$ is accessible and
$0\leq \frac{2\lambda}{c}<1$, the extended process is reflected at $\infty$. In
the case $\frac{2\lambda}{c}\geq 1$, $\infty$ is an exit of the extended

and applicability of semantic segmentation models in real applications. In this
paper, we propose a novel transferable semi-supervised semantic segmentation
model that can transfer the learned segmentation knowledge from a few strong

image-level annotations, significantly broadening the applicable territory of
deep segmentation models. In particular, the proposed model consists of two

Prediction transfer Network (P-Net). The L-Net learns to transfer the
segmentation knowledge from strong categories to the images in the weak
categories and produces coarse pixel-level semantic maps, by effectively
exploiting the similar appearance shared across categories. Meanwhile, the
P-Net tailors the transferred knowledge through a carefully designed
adversarial learning strategy and produces refined segmentation results with
better details. Integrating the L-Net and P-Net achieves 96.5% and 89.4%

random access protocol is proposed that resolves collisions and performs timing
estimation by simply utilizing the large number of antennas envisioned in
Massive MIMO networks. UEs entering the network perform spreading in both time
and frequency domains, and their timing offsets are estimated at the base
station in closed-form using a subspace decomposition approach. This
information is used to compute channel estimates that are subsequently employed
by the base station to communicate with the detected UEs. The favorable
propagation conditions of Massive MIMO suppress interference among UEs whereas
the inherent timing misalignments improve the detection capabilities of the
protocol. Numerical results are used to validate the performance of the
proposed procedure in cellular networks under uncorrelated and correlated

this class of problems, we propose a proximal gradient method with
extrapolation and line search (PGels). This method is developed based on a
special potential function and successfully incorporates both extrapolation and
non-monotone line search, which are two simple and efficient accelerating
techniques for the proximal gradient method. Thanks to the line search, this
method allows more flexibilities in choosing the extrapolation parameters and
updates them adaptively at each iteration if a certain line search criterion is
not satisfied. Moreover, with proper choices of parameters, our PGels reduces
to many existing algorithms. We also show that, under some mild conditions, our
line search criterion is well defined and any cluster point of the sequence
generated by PGels is a stationary point of our problem. In addition, by
assuming the Kurdyka-${\L}$ojasiewicz exponent of the objective in our problem,
we further analyze the local convergence rate of two special cases of PGels,
including the widely used non-monotone proximal gradient method as one case.
Finally, we conduct some numerical experiments for solving the $\ell_1$
regularized logistic regression problem and the $\ell_{1\text{-}2}$ regularized
least squares problem. Our numerical results illustrate the efficiency of PGels
and show the potential advantage of combining two accelerating techniques.

approach for robot gaze control. Our approach enables a robot to learn and to
adapt its gaze control strategy for human-robot interaction neither with the
use of external sensors nor with human supervision. The robot learns to focus
its attention onto groups of people from its own audio-visual experiences,
independently of the number of people, of their positions and of their physical
appearances. In particular, we use a recurrent neural network architecture in
combination with Q-learning to find an optimal action-selection policy; we
pre-train the network using a simulated environment that mimics realistic
scenarios that involve speaking/silent participants, thus avoiding the need of
tedious sessions of a robot interacting with people. Our experimental
evaluation suggests that the proposed method is robust against parameter
estimation, i.e. the parameter values yielded by the method do not have a
decisive impact on the performance. The best results are obtained when both
audio and visual information is jointly used. Experiments with the Nao robot
indicate that our framework is a step forward towards the autonomous learning
of socially acceptable gaze behavior.

which are located in a diamond phononic crystal resonator. The strain in the
lattice would induce the coupling between the NV centers and the phonon mode.
The strong coupling between the excited state of the NV centers and the phonon
is realized by adding an optical laser driving. This four level NV centers
system exhibits the coherent population trapping (CPT), and yields giant
resonantly enhanced acoustic nonlinearities, with zero linear susceptibility.
Based on this nonlinearity, the single phonon source can be realized. We
numerically calculate $g^{(2)}(0)$ of the single phonon source. We discuss the
effects of the thermal noise and the external driving strength.

  Journal of Topology and Analysis",,,,"math.MG math.AT math.GT math.KT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is a systematic approach to the construction of coronas (i.e.
Higson dominated boundaries at infinity) of combable spaces. We introduce three
additional properties for combings: properness, coherence and expandingness.
Properness is the condition under which our construction of the corona works.
Under the assumption of coherence and expandingness, attaching our corona to a
Rips complex construction yields a contractible $\sigma$-compact space in which
the corona sits as a $Z$-set. This results in bijectivity of transgression
maps, injectivity of the coarse assembly map and surjectivity of the coarse
co-assembly map. For groups we get an estimate on the cohomological dimension
of the corona in terms of the asymptotic dimension. Furthermore, if the group
admits a finite model for its classifying space $BG$, then our constructions
yield a $Z$-structure for the group.

Attachment (SPA) model. This model naturally combines geometry and preferential
attachment using the notion of spheres of influence. It was previously shown in
several research papers that graphs generated by the SPA model are similar to
real-world networks in many aspects. Also, this model was successfully used for
several practical applications. However, the clustering properties of the SPA
model were not fully analyzed. The clustering coefficient is an important
characteristic of complex networks which is tightly connected with its
community structure. In the current paper, we study the behaviour of C(d),
which is the average local clustering coefficient for the vertices of degree d.
It was empirically shown that in real-world networks C(d) usually decreases as
1/d^a for some a>0 and it was often observed that a=1. We prove that in the SPA
model C(d) decreases as 1/d. Furthermore, we are also able to prove that not
only the average but the individual local clustering coefficient of a vertex v
of degree $d$ behaves as 1/d if d is large enough. The obtained results further
confirm the suitability of the SPA model for fitting various real-world complex
networks.

correlations generally have no Gaussian extremality. We therefore propose a
different approach by introducing relevantly averaged states to address
correlation. This enables us to define a non-Gaussianity measure based on,

Aitken's work in 1934. Equivalently each JCF corresponds to a certain
permutation $\pi$ introduced by Norman in 1995. These permutations $\pi =
\pi(r,s,p)$ depend on the dimensions $r$, $s$ of the Jordan blocks, and on $p$.
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for $\pi(r,s,p)$ to be trivial,
building on work of M.J. Barry. We show that when $\pi(r,s,p)$ is nontrivial,
it is an involution involving reversals. Finally, we prove that the group
$G(r,p)$ generated by $\pi(r,s,p)$ for all $s$, `factors' as a wreath product
corresponding to the factorisation $r=ab$ as a product of its $p'$-part $a$ and
$p$-part $b$: precisely $G(r, p)={\sf S}_a\wr {\sf D}_b$ where ${\sf S}_a$ is a
symmetric group of degree $a$, and ${\sf D}_b$ is a dihedral group of degree
$b$.

and the effect of noise into account. We then discuss how the distribution of
individual galaxy shapes in the observed field of view can be modeled by
fitting Fourier modes to the shear pattern directly. We simulated samples of
galaxy ellipticities, using both theoretical distributions and real data for
ellipticities and noise. We determined the possible bias $\Delta e$, the
efficiency $\eta$ and the robustness of the least absolute deviations, the
biweight, and the convex hull peeling estimators, compared to the canonical
weighted mean. Using these statistics for regression, we have shown the
applicability of direct Fourier mode fitting. These estimators can be unbiased
in the absence of noise, and decrease noise bias by more than $\sim 30\%$. The
convex hull peeling estimator distribution is centered around the underlying
shear, and its bias least affected by noise. The least absolute deviations
estimator to be the most efficient estimator in almost all cases, except in the
Gaussian case, where it's still competitive ($0.83<\eta <5.1$) and therefore
robust. These results hold when fitting Fourier modes, where amplitudes of
variation in ellipticity are determined to the order of $10^{-3}$. The peak of
the ellipticity distribution is a direct tracer of the underlying shear and
unaffected by noise, and we have shown that estimators that are sensitive to a
central cusp perform more efficiently, potentially reducing uncertainties by
more than $50\%$ and significantly decreasing noise bias.

Covariance matrices are crucial in spatio-temporal statistical tasks, but are
often very expensive to compute and store, especially in 3D. Therefore, we
approximate covariance functions by cheap surrogates in a low-rank tensor
format. We apply the Tucker and canonical tensor decompositions to a family of
Matern- and Slater-type functions with varying parameters and demonstrate
numerically that their approximations exhibit exponentially fast convergence.
We prove the exponential convergence of the Tucker and canonical approximations
in tensor rank parameters. Several statistical operations are performed in this
low-rank tensor format, including evaluating the conditional covariance matrix,
spatially averaged estimation variance, computing a quadratic form,
determinant, trace, loglikelihood, inverse, and Cholesky decomposition of a
large covariance matrix. Low-rank tensor approximations reduce the computing
and storage costs essentially. For example, the storage cost is reduced from an
exponential $\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ to a linear scaling $\mathcal{O}(drn)$, where
$d$ is the spatial dimension, $n$ is the number of mesh points in one
direction, and $r$ is the tensor rank. Prerequisites for applicability of the
proposed techniques are the assumptions that the data, locations, and

affect cooperators' punishment behaviors. We focus on how different parameters
and spatial structures govern evolutionary dynamics on three different kinds of
networks by employing mean-field analysis based on replicator dynamics and
Monte Carlo simulations. On regular lattices, defectors are overall extincted
since cooperators, especially selfish cooperators, have great evolutionary
advantages due to strong network reciprocity, and at the same time the number
of altruistic cooperators decays. Conversely, abundant shortcuts in regular
random networks lead to the prevalence of altruistic cooperators, but
cooperators suffer from free-riding behaviors of defectors. Of particular
interest, we find that small-world topology can simultaneously help cooperators
successfully outperform defectors by means of strong network reciprocity, and
enable rich contacting opportunities with defectors to facilitate the expansion
of altruistic cooperators. Therefore, we clarify that small world is the

recent model of Livnat \etal~\cite{evolfocs14} the fitness of an individual
depends on whether the truth assignments on $n$ variables that reproduce
through recombination satisfy a particular Boolean function. Whereas in the
original model a satisfying assignment always confers a small evolutionary
advantage, in our model the two species are in an evolutionary race with the
parasite enjoying the advantage if the value of its Boolean function matches
its host, and the host wishing to mismatch its parasite. Surprisingly, this
model makes a simple and robust behavioral prediction. The typical system
behavior is \textit{periodic}. These cycles stay bounded away from the boundary
and thus, \textit{learning-dynamics competition between sexual species can
provide an explanation for genetic diversity.} This explanation is due solely
to the natural selection process. No mutations, environmental changes, etc.,
need be invoked.
  The game played at the gene level may have many Nash equilibria with widely
diverse fitness levels. Nevertheless, sexual evolution leads to gene
coordination that implements an optimal strategy, i.e., an optimal population
mixture, at the species level. Namely, the play of the many ""selfish genes""
implements a time-averaged correlated equilibrium where the average fitness of
each species is exactly equal to its value in the two species zero-sum
competition.
  Our analysis combines tools from game theory, dynamical systems and Boolean
functions to establish a novel class of conservative dynamical systems.

layer depth and can potentially contribute to the phytoplankton sustenance over
winter: 1) variability of air-sea fluxes and 2) three-dimensional processes
arising from strong fronts. To study the role of these factors, we perform
several three-dimensional numerical simulations forced with air-sea fluxes at
different temporal averaging frequencies as well as different spatial
resolutions. Results show that in the winter, when the average mixed layer is
much deeper than the euphotic layer and the days are short, phytoplankton
production is relatively insensitive to the high-frequency variability in
air-sea fluxes. The duration of upper ocean stratification due to
high-frequency variability in air-sea fluxes is short and hence has a small
impact on phytoplankton production. On the other hand, slumping of fronts
creates patchy, stratified, shallow regions that persist considerably longer
than stratification caused by changes in air-sea fluxes. Simulations show that
before spring warming, the average MLD with fronts is about 700 m shallower
than the average MLD without fronts. Therefore, fronts increase the residence
time of phytoplankton in the euphotic layer and contribute to phytoplankton
growth. Results show that before the spring warming, the depth-integrated
phytoplankton concentration is about twice as large as phytoplankton
concentration when there are no fronts. Hence, fronts are important for setting
the MLD and sustaining phytoplankton in the winter. Model results also show
that higher numerical resolution leads to stronger restratification, shallower
mixed layers, greater variability in the MLD and higher production of
phytoplankton.

impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. On the other hand,
their opaqueness has led to a surge of interest in explainable systems. In this
work, we emphasize the importance of model explanation in various forms such as
visual pointing and textual justification. The lack of data with justification
annotations is one of the bottlenecks of generating multimodal explanations.
Thus, we propose two large-scale datasets with annotations that visually and
textually justify a classification decision for various activities, i.e. ACT-X,
and for question answering, i.e. VQA-X. We also introduce a multimodal
methodology for generating visual and textual explanations simultaneously. We
quantitatively show that training with the textual explanations not only yields
better textual justification models, but also models that better localize the
evidence that support their decision.

differ from the scattering from long range potential? With the development of

distribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing and
understanding momentum-resolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits
of long range and short range potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical
model to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability
distribution in both and real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering
potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright-field disk to
deflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of
a deflection cause a redistribution of intensity within the bright-field disk.
Because long range and short range features are encoded differently in the
diffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in
differential phase contrast (DPC) or Center-of-Mass (CoM) imaging. The shape
profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the
probe gradient and not the highly-singular atomic potentials or their local
fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic-number sensitivity, whose
precise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence
angles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to
bright field imaging. The range of collection angles impacts DPC and CoM
imaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit,
while DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.

a hybrid approach that combines continuous-time quantum walks with Grover

sharpness of probability improves. The results between the new algorithm,

large fraction of options does not have any reviews available. Such options are
frequently neglected as viable choices, and in turn are unlikely to be
evaluated, creating a vicious cycle. Platforms can engage users to deviate from
their preferred choice by offering monetary incentives for choosing a different
option instead. To efficiently learn the optimal incentives to offer, we
consider structural information in user preferences and introduce a novel
algorithm - Coordinated Online Learning (CoOL) - for learning with structural
information modeled as convex constraints. We provide formal guarantees on the
performance of our algorithm and test the viability of our approach in a user
study with data of apartments on Airbnb. Our findings suggest that our approach
is well-suited to learn appropriate incentives and increase exploration on the

stratifies CKD severity levels obtaining high average sensitivity, precision
and F-measure (~93%). We also conduct experiments in which the dimensionality

many RF-signal processing applications. To this end, numerous schemes for
electronic, MEMS-based, and microwave photonic filters have been demonstrated.
Filtering schemes based on microwave photonic systems offer superior
flexibility and tunability to traditional RF filters. However, these
optical-based filters are typically limited to GHz-widths and often have large
RF insertion losses, posing challenges for integration into high-fidelity
radiofrequency circuits. In this article, we demonstrate a novel type of
microwave filter that combines the attractive features of microwave photonic
filters with high-Q phononic signal processing using a photonic-phononic
emit-receive process. Through this process, a RF signal encoded on a guided
optical wave is transduced onto a GHz-frequency acoustic wave, where it may be
filtered through shaping of acoustic transfer functions before being re-encoded
onto a spatially separate optical probe. This emit-receive functionality,
realized in an integrated silicon waveguide, produces MHz-bandwidth band-pass
filtering while supporting low RF insertion losses necessary for high dynamic
range in a microwave photonic link. We also demonstrate record-high internal
efficiency for emit-receive operations of this type, and show that the
emit-receive operation is uniquely suitable for the creation of serial filter
banks with minimal loss of fidelity. This photonic-phononic emitter-receiver
represents a new method for low-distortion signal-processing in an integrated
all-silicon device.

models of black hole formation were largely abandoned. The result is that later
models appear to either assume that black hole event horizons already exist
(such as in Hawking's 1975 paper on radiation from black holes), bypass the
relative frames altogether (such as in Mirabel's 2017 paper on the formation of
stellar black holes), or use coordinate systems that essentially ignore the
remote viewer's point of view (Kruskal 1960).
  This paper attempts to re-establish the concept of a ""nascent black hole"" as
the correct approach for modelling black holes from remote reference frames. It
uses, and only needs to use, Schwarzschild metrics and presents some example
scenarios to demonstrate the concepts through worked examples. Alternatives
such as Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates and Penrose's local collapsing frames
are not disputed; the Schwarzschild metrics must still be valid outside the
event horizon and this paper is largely concerned with ""remote viewers"" for
various meanings of ""remote"".
  For most astrophysical or cosmological questions the difference between
""actual"" and ""nascent"" black holes is largely irrelevant as they behave
similarly for most practical purposes. However the difference becomes critical
for effects that require an event horizon to interact with the remote viewer,
such as Hawking-Zel'dovich radiation and the related information problems
outlined by Susskind. That is: if there are no possible observable paths from a
nascent event horizon to any remote viewer then there also cannot be any
evaporation to the remote viewer
