different species, called mixed-species flocks. Mathematical and computational
models of collective animal movement behaviour, however, typically assume that
groups and populations consist of identical individuals. In this paper, using
the mathematical framework of the coagulation-fragmentation process, we develop
and analyse a model of merge and split group dynamics, also called
fission-fusion dynamics, for heterogeneous populations that contain two types
(or species) of individuals. We assume that more heterogeneous groups
experience higher split rates than homogeneous groups, forming two daughter
groups whose compositions are drawn uniformly from all possible partitions. We
analytically derive a master equation for group size and compositions and find
mean-field steady-state solutions. We predict that there is a critical group
size below which groups are more likely to be homogeneous and contain the
abundant type/species. Despite the propensity of heterogeneous groups to split
at higher rates, we find that groups are more likely to be heterogeneous but
only above the critical group size. Monte-Carlo simulation of the model show
excellent agreement with these analytical model results. Thus, our model makes
a testable prediction that composition of flocks are group-size dependent and
do not merely reflect the population level heterogeneity. We discuss the
implications of our results to empirical studies on flocking systems.

  in November 2016. Section 8 of the previous version is omitted from the
  current version; other than minor changes triggered by the omission of this
  section, the two versions are identical",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite significant research efforts, the state-of-the-art algorithm for
maintaining an approximate matching in fully dynamic graphs has a polynomial
{worst-case} update time, even for very poor approximation guarantees. In a
recent breakthrough, Bhattacharya, Henzinger and Nanongkai showed how to
maintain a constant approximation to the minimum vertex cover, and thus also a
constant-factor estimate of the maximum matching size, with polylogarithmic
worst-case update time. Later (in SODA'17 Proc.) they improved the
approximation factor all the way to $2+\epsilon$. Nevertheless, the
longstanding fundamental problem of {maintaining} an approximate matching with
sub-polynomial worst-case time bounds remained open.
  We present a randomized algorithm for maintaining an {almost-maximal}
matching in fully dynamic graphs with polylogarithmic worst-case update time.
Such a matching provides $(2+\epsilon)$-approximations for both the maximum
matching and the minimum vertex cover, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Our result was
done independently of the $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation result of Bhattacharya
et al., so it provides the first $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for minimum
vertex cover (together with Bhattacharya et al.'s result) and the first
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for maximum (integral) matching.
  The polylogarithmic worst-case update time of our algorithm holds
deterministically, while the almost-maximality guarantee holds with high
probability. This result not only settles the aforementioned problem on dynamic
matchings, but also provides essentially the best possible approximation
guarantee for dynamic vertex cover (assuming the unique games conjecture).

historical importance in nuclear clustering. In the last 15 years the $4\alpha$
condensate state has been proposed as a new-type cluster state.
  Purpose: The aim is to reveal a dynamical process of the formation of
different kinds of cluster states, in terms of a ""container"" aspect of
clusters, in $^{16}{\rm O}$.
  Method: The so-called THSR wave function for the $4\alpha$ clusters is
extended to inclusion of two different containers occupied independently by the
$^{12}{\rm C}$ $(3\alpha)$ and $\alpha$ clusters.
  Results: The five $J^\pi=0^+$ states with $4\alpha$ tetrahedral shape,
$\alpha+{^{12}{\rm C}}$ cluster structures, and the $4\alpha$ condensate
character, are found to be represented, to good approximation, by single
configurations of the extended THSR wave function with containers of
appropriate shape and size.
  Conclusions: It is demonstrated in $^{16}{\rm O}$ that the dynamical
evolution of cluster structures can be caused by size and shape evolution of a
container occupied with clusters. The $\alpha$ condensate with gaslike
$4\alpha$ configuration appears as a limit of the cluster formation.

cosmological constant. First introduced to the general theory of relativity by
Einstein in 1917 in order to describe a universe that was assumed to be static,
the term fell from favour in the wake of the discovery of the expanding
universe, only to make a dramatic return in recent times. We consider
historical and philosophical aspects of the cosmological constant over four
main epochs: (i) the use of the term in static cosmologies (both Newtonian and
relativistic); (ii) the marginalization of the term following the discovery of
cosmic expansion; (iii) the use of the term to address specific cosmic puzzles
such as the timespan of expansion, the formation of galaxies and the redshifts
of the quasars; (iv) the re-emergence of the term in today's Lamda-CDM
cosmology. We find that the cosmological constant was never truly banished from
theoretical models of the universe, but was sidelined by astronomers for
reasons of convenience. We also find that the return of the term to the
forefront of modern cosmology did not occur as an abrupt paradigm shift due to
one particular set of observations, but as the result of a number of empirical
advances such as the measurement of present cosmic expansion using the Hubble
Space Telescope, the measurement of past expansion using type SN 1a supernovae
as standard candles, and the measurement of perturbations in the cosmic
microwave background by balloon and satellite. We give a brief overview of
contemporary interpretations of the physics underlying the cosmic constant and
conclude with a synopsis of the famous cosmological constant problem.

We evaluate BMPS on three increasingly difficult metareasoning problems: when
to terminate computation, how to allocate computation between competing
options, and planning. Across all three domains, BMPS achieved near-optimal
performance and compared favorably to previously proposed metareasoning
heuristics. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of BMPS in an

list of decimal equivalents of Multiplicative Inverses (MI) of all the
elemental polynomials of a monic irreducible polynomial over Galois Field
GF(2^8) [1]. In this paper a new method to search monic Irreducible Polynomials
(IPs) over Galois fields GF(p^q) has been introduced. Here the decimal
equivalents of each monic elemental polynomial (ep), two at a time, are split
into the p-nary coefficients of each term, of those two monic elemental
polynomials. From those coefficients the p-nary coefficients of the resultant
monic basic polynomials (BP) have been obtained. The decimal equivalents of
resultant basic polynomials with p-nary coefficients are treated as decimal
equivalents of the monic reducible polynomials, since monic reducible
polynomials must have two monic elemental polynomials as its factor. The
decimal equivalents of polynomials belonging to the list of reducible
polynomials are cancelled leaving behind the monic irreducible polynomials. A
non-monic irreducible polynomial is computed by multiplying a monic irreducible
polynomial by alpha where alpha belongs to GF(p^q) and assumes values from 2 to
(p-1).

relations between different states. In this work, we show how this two-fold
role of observables constitutes a key feature in the conceptual analysis of
classical and quantum kinematics, shedding a new light on the distinguishing
feature of the quantum at the kinematical level. We first take a look at the

to the geometric reformulation of quantum kinematics in terms of K\""ahler

role of observables is the constitutive ingredient defining what an observable
is. Moreover, it points to the fact that, from the restricted point of view of
the transformational role of observables, classical and quantum kinematics
behave in exactly the same way. Finally, we present Landsman's general

processed spatially in the radio-frequency (RF) front-end and thereby the
number of RF chains can be reduced to save hardware cost, power consumptions
and pilot overhead. Most existing work focuses on how to select, or design
analog beams to achieve performance close to full digital systems. However,
since beams are strongly correlated (directed) to certain users, the selection
of beams and scheduling of users should be jointly considered. In this paper,
we formulate the joint user scheduling and beam selection problem based on the
Lyapunov-drift optimization framework and obtain the optimal scheduling policy
in a closed-form. For reduced overhead and computational cost, the proposed
scheduling schemes are based only upon statistical channel state information.
Towards this end, asymptotic expressions of the downlink broadcast channel
capacity are derived. To address the weighted sum rate maximization problem in
the Lyapunov optimization, an algorithm based on block coordinated update is
proposed and proved to converge to the optimum of the relaxed problem. To
further reduce the complexity, an incremental greedy scheduling algorithm is
also proposed, whose performance is proved to be bounded within a constant
multiplicative factor. Simulation results based on widely-used spatial channel
models are given. It is shown that the proposed schemes are close to optimal,
and outperform several state-of-the-art schemes.

their differences on a bounded domain are significant. We provide extensive
numerical experiments to understand and compare their differences. We find that
these four operators collapse to the classical Laplace operator as \alpha \to
2. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these four operators are different,
and the k-th (for k \in N) eigenvalue of the spectral fractional Laplacian is
always larger than those of the fractional Laplacian and regional fractional
Laplacian. For any \alpha \in (0, 2), the peridynamic operator can provide a
good approximation to the fractional Laplacian, if the horizon size \delta is
sufficiently large. We find that the solution of the peridynamic model

O(\delta^{-\alpha}). In contrast, although the regional fractional Laplacian
can be used to approximate the fractional Laplacian as \alpha \to 2, it

having each node of the network learn its entire $|H|$-neighborhood. However,
when bandwidth is limited, the problem becomes harder.
  Upper and lower bounds in the presence of congestion have been established
for several classes of subgraphs, including cycles, trees, and more complicated
subgraphs. All bounds shown so far have been linear or sublinear. We show that
the subgraph-freeness problem is not, in general, solvable in linear time: for

Theory, the studies in Algorithmic Mechanism Design typically employ the
worst-case analysis and approximation schemes of Theoretical Computer Science.
For instance, the approximation ratio, which is the canonical measure of
evaluating how well an incentive-compatible mechanism approximately optimizes
the objective, is defined in the worst-case sense. It compares the performance
of the optimal mechanism against the performance of a truthful mechanism, for
all possible inputs.
  In this paper, we take the average-case analysis approach, and tackle one of
the primary motivating problems in Algorithmic Mechanism Design -- the
scheduling problem [Nisan and Ronen 1999]. One version of this problem which
includes a verification component is studied by [Koutsoupias 2014]. It was
shown that the problem has a tight approximation ratio bound of (n+1)/2 for the
single-task setting, where n is the number of machines. We show, however, when
the costs of the machines to executing the task follow any independent and
identical distribution, the average-case approximation ratio of the mechanism
given in [Koutsoupias 2014] is upper bounded by a constant. This positive
result asymptotically separates the average-case ratio from the worst-case
ratio, and indicates that the optimal mechanism for the problem actually works
well on average, although in the worst-case the expected cost of the mechanism
is Theta(n) times that of the optimal cost.

comparative case studies. Like the classical method, we present an algorithm to
estimate the unobservable counterfactual of a treatment unit. A distinguishing
feature of our algorithm is that of de-noising the data matrix via singular
value thresholding, which renders our approach robust in multiple facets: it
automatically identifies a good subset of donors, overcomes the challenges of
missing data, and continues to work well in settings where covariate
information may not be provided. To begin, we establish the condition under
which the fundamental assumption in synthetic control-like approaches holds,
i.e. when the linear relationship between the treatment unit and the donor pool
prevails in both the pre- and post-intervention periods. We provide the first
finite sample analysis for a broader class of models, the Latent Variable
Model, in contrast to Factor Models previously considered in the literature.
Further, we show that our de-noising procedure accurately imputes missing
entries, producing a consistent estimator of the underlying signal matrix
provided $p = \Omega( T^{-1 + \zeta})$ for some $\zeta > 0$; here, $p$ is the
fraction of observed data and $T$ is the time interval of interest. Under the
same setting, we prove that the mean-squared-error (MSE) in our prediction
estimation scales as $O(\sigma^2/p + 1/\sqrt{T})$, where $\sigma^2$ is the
noise variance. Using a data aggregation method, we show that the MSE can be
made as small as $O(T^{-1/2+\gamma})$ for any $\gamma \in (0, 1/2)$, leading to
a consistent estimator. We also introduce a Bayesian framework to quantify the
model uncertainty through posterior probabilities. Our experiments, using both
real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrate that our robust generalization
yields an improvement over the classical synthetic control method.

characteristic Kondo temperature, TK, where coupling with the conduction-band
electrons produces an entangled state that screens the local moment. In
contrast, moments embedded in insulators remain unscreened at all temperatures.
This raises the question about the fate of magnetic moments in intermediate,
pseudogap systems, such as graphene. In these systems theory predicts a quantum
phase-transition at a critical coupling strength which separates a local
magnetic-moment phase from a Kondo screened phase. However, attempts to
experimentally confirm these predictions and their intriguing consequences such
as the ability to electrostatically control magnetic moments, have thus far
been elusive. Here we report the observation of Kondo screening and the quantum
phase-transition between screened and unscreened phases of vacancy
magnetic-moments in graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
spectroscopy (STS) and numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, we
identified Kondo screening by its spectroscopic signature and mapped the
phase-transition as a function of coupling strength and chemical potential. We
show that this transition makes it possible to turn the magnetic-moment on and
off electrostatically through a gate voltage or mechanically through variations
in local curvature.

We find that in the absence of an external pressure, the liquid interface is

is displaced along the spherical surface but remains stable due to re-entrant

surroundings. We thus performed a spectral classification of the sample using
He I-II and metal lines rates, as well as the Marxist Ghost Buster (MGB)
software for O-type stars and the IACOB standards catalog for B-type stars. Out
of the 61 candidates, we have classified 42 stars as new massive OB-type stars,
earlier than B3, in Cygnus OB2 and surroundings, including 11 O-type stars. The
other candidates are discarded as they display later spectral types
inconsistent with membership in the association. However, the magnitude cutoff
and dust extinction introduce an incompleteness. Many O and early B stars at B
> 16 mag are still undiscovered in the region. Finally, we have studied the age
and extinction distribution of our sample within the region, placing them in
the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram using different stellar models in order to
assess age uncertainties. Massive star formation in Cygnus OB2 seems to have
proceeded from lower to higher Galactic longitudes, regardless of the details
of the models used. The correlation between age and Galactic longitude
previously found in the region is now confirmed.

a nonlinear map, and then define a coupled image of an original image in order
to construct a kernel function. Finally, the proposed model is solved in a
kernel function space instead of in the projecting space from a nonlinear map.
For the proposed model, we theoretically show under what conditions the mapping
image is in the space of bounded variation when the original image is in the
space of bounded variation. It is also found that the proposed model further
extends the generalized TV model and the information from three different
channels of color images can be fused by adopting various kernel functions. A

qubits, spintronics and quantum computations. Efficient heat dissipation is a
key factor for the reliability and stability of topological semimetal-based
nano-electronics devices, which is closely related to high thermal
conductivity. In this work, the elastic properties and lattice thermal
conductivity of TaN are investigated by first-principles calculations and the
linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time
approximation (RTA). According to the calculated bulk modulus, shear modulus
and $C_{44}$, TaN can be regarded as a potential incompressible and hard
material. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is predicted to be
838.62 $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ along a axis and 1080.40 $\mathrm{W m^{-1}
K^{-1}}$ along c axis, showing very strong anisotropy. It is found that the
lattice thermal conductivity of TaN is several tens of times higher than one of
other topological semimetal, such as TaAs, MoP and ZrTe, which is due to very
longer phonon lifetimes for TaN than other topological semimetal. The very
different atomic masses of Ta and N atoms lead to a very large acoustic-optical
band gap, and then prohibits the scattering between acoustic and optical phonon
modes, which gives rise to very long phonon lifetimes. Based on mass difference
factor, the WC and WN can be regarded as potential candidates with ultrahigh
lattice thermal conductivity. Calculated results show that isotope scattering
has little effect on lattice thermal conductivity, and that phonon with mean
free path(MFP) larger than 20 (80) $\mathrm{\mu m}$ at 300 K has little
contribution to the total lattice thermal conductivity. This work implies that
TaN-based nano-electronics devices may be more stable and reliable due to
efficient heat dissipation.

determine the step size for current gradient given the history of previous

can locate the global optimality within finite iterations. Empirically an

previously published distances to the same Cepheids with Hubble Space Telescope
parallax measurements and distances based on the IR surface brightness method,
Wesenheit functions, and the main-sequence fitting method. The systematic
deviations in the distances determined here with respect to those of previous
publications is less than 1-2%. Hence, we constructed Galactic mid-IR
period-luminosity (PL) relations for classical Cepheids in the four Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) bands (W1, W2, W3, and W4) and the four Spitzer
Space Telescope bands ([3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0]). Based on our sample of
hundreds of Cepheids, the WISE PL relations have been determined for the first
time; their dispersion is approximately 0.10 mag. Using the currently most
complete sample, our Spitzer PL relations represent a significant improvement
in accuracy, especially in the [3.6] band which has the smallest dispersion
(0.066 mag). In addition, the average mid-IR extinction curve for Cepheids has
been obtained: A_W1/A_Ks=0.560, A_W2/A_Ks=0.479, A_W3/A_Ks=0.507,
A_W4/A_Ks=0.406, A_[3.6]/A_Ks=0.481, A_[4.5]/A_Ks=0.469, A_[5.8]/A_Ks=0.427,
and A_[8.0]/A_Ks=0.427 mag.

edges. The falling of valence band edge (VBE) facilitates production of free

suffers high computational complexity. In particular, a complex optimization
problem needs to be solved to obtain the remote radio head (RRH) ordering
criterion in each transmission block, which will help to determine the active
RRHs and the associated fronthaul links. In this paper, we propose innovative
approaches to reduce the complexity of this key step in group sparse
beamforming. Specifically, we first develop a smoothed $\ell_p$-minimization
approach with the iterative reweighted-$\ell_2$ algorithm to return a
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point solution, as well as enhancing the capability of
inducing group sparsity in the beamforming vectors. By leveraging the
Lagrangian duality theory, we obtain closed-form solutions at each iteration to
reduce the computational complexity. The well-structured solutions provide the
opportunities to apply the large-dimensional random matrix theory to derive
deterministic approximations for the RRH ordering criterion. Such an approach
helps to guide the RRH selection only based on the statistical channel state
information (CSI), which does not require frequent update, thereby
significantly reducing the computation overhead. Simulation results shall
demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed $\ell_p$-minimization
approach, as well as the effectiveness of the large system analysis based

different shapes owing to their high deformability. Predicting the realized
shapes is a complex field as they are determined by the intricate interplay
between the flow conditions and the membrane mechanics. In this work we
construct the shape phase diagram of a single red blood cell with a
physiological viscosity ratio flowing in a microchannel. We use both
experimental in-vitro measurements as well as 3D numerical simulations to
complement the respective other one. Numerically, we have easy control over the
initial starting configuration and natural access to the full 3D shape. With
this information we obtain the phase diagram as a function of initial position,
starting shape and cell velocity. Experimentally, we measure the occurrence
frequency of the different shapes as a function of the cell velocity to
construct the experimental diagram which is in good agreement with the
numerical observations. Two different major shapes are found, namely croissants
and slippers. Notably, both shapes show coexistence at low (<1 mm/s) and high
velocities (>3 mm/s) while in-between only croissants are stable. This
pronounced bistability indicates that RBC shapes are not only determined by
system parameters such as flow velocity or channel size, but also strongly
depend on the initial conditions.

time-scale $\tau$ is non-Gaussian, and skewed towards negative values. This
implies that, on average, particles gain energy over a period of time that is
longer than the duration over which they lose energy. We call this
$\textit{slow gain}$ and $\textit{fast loss}$. We find that the third moment of
$W(\tau)$ scales as $\tau^3$, for small values of $\tau$. We show that the PDF
of power-input $p$ is negatively skewed too; we use this skewness ${\rm Ir}$ as
a measure of the time-irreversibility and we demonstrate that it increases
sharply with the Stokes number ${\rm St}$, for small ${\rm St}$; this increase
slows down at ${\rm St} \simeq 1$. Furthermore, we obtain the PDFs of $t^+$ and
$t^-$, the times over which $p$ has, respectively, positive or negative signs,
i.e., the particle gains or loses energy. We obtain from these PDFs a direct
and natural quantification of the the slow-gain and fast-loss of the particles,
because these PDFs possess exponential tails, whence we infer the
characteristic loss and gain times $t_{\rm loss}$ and $t_{\rm gain}$,
respectively; and we obtain $t_{\rm loss} < t_{\rm gain}$, for all the cases we
have considered. Finally, we show that the slow-gain in energy of the particles
is equally likely in vortical or strain-dominated regions of the flow; in
contrast, the fast-loss of energy occurs with greater probability in the latter
than in the former.

approach for incrementally predicting values of an unknown function at test
points using the Gaussian Processes framework. It is well-known that in the
Gaussian processes framework, the computational bottlenecks are the inversion
of the (regularized) kernel matrix and the computation of the hyper-parameters
defining the kernel. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First,
we formalize an approach to compute the inverse of the kernel matrix using
randomized matrix factorization algorithms in a streaming scenario, i.e., data
is generated incrementally over time. The metrics of accuracy and computational
efficiency of the proposed method are compared against a batch approach based
on use of randomized matrix factorization and an existing streaming approach
based on approximating the Gaussian process by a finite set of basis vectors.
Second, we extend the sequential factorization approach to a class of kernel
functions for which the hyperparameters can be efficiently optimized. All
results are demonstrated on two publicly available datasets.

constant power loads methods is addressed in this paper. Constant power loads
(CPLs) often cause instability due to its negative impedance characteristics.
What is the worse, CPLs may cause that the system admits no equilibria for its
nonlinearity. The purpose of paper can be summarized as: A) designing a
controller to overcome CPLs instability; B) obtaining the sufficient conditions
to guarantee the existence of the equilibria; C) Under the conditions of
equilibria existing, obtaining the sufficient conditions of local stability.
For the first objective, the method based on virtual resistance and virtual
inductance is proposed. For the second objective, we transform the problem of
solvability of quadratic equations into the existence of the fixed point of a
mapping. Thus, the analytical sufficient conditions is obtained based on Tarski
fixed point theorem. Moreover, a numerical method is also provided to reduce
conservatism. For the third objective, the small-signal model is established to
predict the system qualitative behavior around equilibria. The stability
conditions are obtained by using quadratic eigenvalue problem (GEP) theorem.
These explicit conditions are obtained as a function of system parameters and
it lead to build reliable microgrid.

a procedure for characterizing connectivity in a network by clustering nodes or
groups of channels that display high level of coordination as measured by
""cluster-coherence"". While the most common approach to measuring dependence
between clusters is through pairs of single time series, our method proposes
cluster coherence which measures dependence between whole clusters rather than
between single elements. Thus it takes into account both the dependence between
clusters and within channels in a cluster. Using our method, the identified
clusters contain time series that exhibit high cross-dependence in the spectral
domain. That is, these clusters correspond to connected brain regions with
synchronized oscillatory activity. In the simulation studies, we show that the
proposed HCC outperforms commonly used clustering algorithms, such as average
coherence and minimum coherence based methods. To study clustering in a network
of multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG) during an epileptic seizure, we
applied the HCC method and identified connectivity in alpha (8-12) Hertz and
beta (16-30) Hertz bands at different phases of the recording: before an
epileptic seizure, during the early and middle phases of the seizure episode.

a fine-grained grid search is needed for tuning the temperature hyperparameter

final network size (or the compression rate). On the other hand, KD is proved
to be useful for model compression for the FER problem, and we discovered that
its effects gets more and more significant with the decreasing model size. In
addition, we hypothesized that translation invariance achieved using
max-pooling layers would not be useful for the FER problem as the expressions
are sensitive to small, pixel-wise changes around the eye and the mouth.
However, we have found an intriguing improvement on generalization when
max-pooling is used. We conducted experiments on two widely-used FER datasets,
CK+ and Oulu-CASIA. Our smallest model (MicroExpNet), obtained using knowledge
distillation, is less than 1MB in size and works at 1851 frames per second on

In our formalism an additional factor is obtained, which describes distribution

discover new most stable states (called quasibound states) of the compound
nucleus (CN) formed during the capture of $\alpha$ particle by the nucleus.
With a simple example, we explain why these states cannot appear in traditional
calculations of the $\alpha$ capture cross sections based on monotonic
penetrabilities of a barrier, but they appear in a complete description of the
evolution of the CN. Our result is obtained by a complete description of the CN
evolution, which has the advantages of (1) a clear picture of the formation of
the CN and its disintegration, (2) a detailed quantum description of the CN,
(3) tests of the calculated amplitudes based on quantum mechanics (not realized
in other approaches), and (4) high accuracy of calculations (not achieved in
other approaches). These peculiarities are shown with the capture reaction of
$\alpha + ^{44}{\rm Ca}$. We predict quasibound energy levels and determine
fusion probabilities for this reaction. The difference between our approach and
theory of quasistationary states with complex energies applied for the $\alpha$
capture is also discussed. We show (1) that theory does not provide
calculations for the cross section of $\alpha$ capture (according to modern
models of the $\alpha$ capture), in contrast with our formalism, and (2) these
two approaches describe different states of the $\alpha$ capture (for the same
$\alpha$-nucleus potential).

thermodynamical quantities, such as the mass, the Wald entropy and the Hawking
temperature. The mass expression is obtained by using the generalized off-shell
Noether potential formulation. It is found that the anti-de Sitter black holes
as well as the Lifshitz black holes with $z=0$ have zero mass and zero entropy,
although they have non-zero temperature. A similar behavior has been observed
in previous works, where the integration constant is not associated with a
conserved charge, and it can be interpreted as a kind of gravitational hair. On
the other hand, the Lifshitz black holes with dynamical exponent $z=4$ have
non-zero conserved charges, and the first law of black hole thermodynamics
holds. Also, we analyze the horizon thermodynamics for the Lifshitz black holes
with $z=4$, and we show that the first law of black hole thermodynamics arises
from the field equations evaluated on the horizon. Furthermore, we study the
propagation of a conformally coupled scalar field on these backgrounds and we
find the quasinormal modes analytically in several cases. We find that for
anti-de Sitter black holes and Lifshitz black holes with $z=4$, there is a
continuous spectrum of frequencies for Dirichlet boundary condition; however,
we show that discrete sets of well defined quasinormal frequencies can be
obtained by considering Neumann boundary conditions.

search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan
Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8th,
is identified tentatively. Its midtime, $T_{C}=2,457,640.1990\pm0.0017$ HJD, is
consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1$\sigma$
confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of
Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a
Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential
transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence
level of $2.5\sigma$. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to
confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima
Centauri in next Polar night at Dome A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of
continuous darkness. \citet{Kipping17} reported two tentative transit-like
signals of Proxima Centauri b, observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation

our detection is 138 minutes later than that predicted by their transit

timescale, these signals can present a limiting background to the low-energy
threshold of dark matter searches, and prevent discovery-class searches for MeV
scale hidden sector dark matter. A systematic study reveals a fast (tau_1) and
slow (tau_2) component to the background. The fast component is compatible with
electrons which were trapped at the liquid surface, and can be reduced by
increasing the electric field. However, the slow component increases linearly
with electric field. Hypotheses for the origin of the effect are discussed, and
techniques for mitigation are suggested.

generalize well to another. In our attempt, we present a ""learning via
translation"" framework. In the baseline, we translate the labeled images from
source to target domain in an unsupervised manner. We then train re-ID models
with the translated images by supervised methods. Yet, being an essential part
of this framework, unsupervised image-image translation suffers from the
information loss of source-domain labels during translation.
  Our motivation is two-fold. First, for each image, the discriminative cues
contained in its ID label should be maintained after translation. Second, given
the fact that two domains have entirely different persons, a translated image
should be dissimilar to any of the target IDs. To this end, we propose to
preserve two types of unsupervised similarities, 1) self-similarity of an image
before and after translation, and 2) domain-dissimilarity of a translated
source image and a target image. Both constraints are implemented in the
similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) which consists of
an Siamese network and a CycleGAN. Through domain adaptation experiment, we
show that images generated by SPGAN are more suitable for domain adaptation and
yield consistent and competitive re-ID accuracy on two large-scale datasets.

$\mathbb{R}^n$ that are projections of mixed-integer linear sets, also known as
MILP-representable or MILP-R sets. We give an alternate algebraic
characterization by showing that a set is MILP-R {\em if and only if} the set
can be described as the intersection of finitely many {\em affine Chvatal
inequalities} in continuous variables (termed AC sets). These inequalities are
a modification of a concept introduced by Blair and Jeroslow. Unlike the case
for linear inequalities, allowing for integer variables in Chvatal inequalities
and projection does not enhance modeling power. We show that the MILP-R sets
are still precisely those sets that are modeled as affine Chvatal inequalites
with integer variables. Furthermore, the projection of a set defined by affine
Chvatal inequalites with integer variables is still an MILP-R set.
  We give a sequential variable elimination scheme that, when applied to a
MILP-R set yields the AC set characterization. This is related to the
elimination scheme of Williams and Williams-Hooker, who describe projections of
integer sets using \emph{disjunctions} of affine Chvatal systems. We show that
disjunctions are unnecessary by showing how to find the affine Chvatal
inequalities that cannot be discovered by the Williams-Hooker scheme. This
allows us to answer a long-standing open question due to Ryan (1991) on
designing an elimination scheme to represent finitely-generated integral
monoids as a system of Chvatal inequalities \emph{without} disjunctions.
Finally, our work can be seen as a generalization of the approach of Blair and
Jeroslow, and Schrijver for constructing consistency testers for integer
programs to general AC sets.

found with much lower frequency than non-nodules. In the class imbalanced
problem, conventional classifiers tend to be overwhelmed by the majority class
and ignore the minority class. We showed that cascaded convolutional neural
networks can classify the nodule candidates precisely for a class imbalanced
nodule candidate data set in our previous study. In this paper, we propose
Fusion classifier in conjunction with the cascaded convolutional neural network
models. To fuse the models, nodule probabilities are calculated by using the
convolutional neural network models at first. Then, Fusion classifier is
trained and tested by the nodule probabilities. The proposed method achieved
the sensitivity of 94.4% and 95.9% at 4 and 8 false positives per scan in Free
Receiver Operating Characteristics (FROC) curve analysis, respectively.
