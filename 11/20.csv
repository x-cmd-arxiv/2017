learning, besides model-free and model-based control, by analogy with the three
types of human memory. i.e. episodic, procedural and semantic memory. But the
theoretical properties of episodic control are not well investigated. Here I
show that in deterministic tree Markov decision processes, episodic control is
equivalent to a form of prioritized sweeping in terms of sample efficiency as
well as memory and computation demands. For general deterministic and
stochastic environments, prioritized sweeping performs better even when memory
and computation demands are restricted to be equal to those of episodic
control. These results suggest generalizations of prioritized sweeping to
partially observable environments, its combined use with function approximation
and the search for possible implementations of prioritized sweeping in brains.

  waveguides at room temperature",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Van der Waals (vdW) materials, weakly bound layered compounds, have received
enormous interest as they offer a malleable playground for a wide range of
physical properties in thermal, electronic and optical devices. In particular,
owing to their inherent deep subwavelength light confinement, they support a
variety of light-matter interactions phenomena such as plasmons, excitons and
phonons conveyed as polaritonic modes. Specifically, semiconductor vdW
materials such as WSe_2 are particularly attractive for photonic and quantum
integrated technologies since they sustain VIS-NIR exciton-polariton modes at
room temperature. In the quest to unravel the underlying physics of these
intriguing phenomena, advanced subdiffraction imaging techniques such as SNOM
has provided valuable insights on the nature of the EP coupling mechanism to
the waveguide modes sustained in vdW materials. While most of these works
focused on the steady state of the EP, the spatio-temporal dynamics of EP
formation, happening in the sub-picosecond regime, remains largely unexplored.
Hence, a direct imaging at the femtosecond-nanoscale of the EP evolution is
critical to the understanding of these coupled light-matter states. Here we
report for the first time the ultrafast and deep-subwavelength imaging of EP
formation and propagation in WSe2 waveguides. Our method, based on a novel
ultrafast pump-probe near-field imaging, allows to directly visualize the EP
time evolution at room temperature. More specifically, and in agreement with
our time dependent model, we directly observe a significantly slow EP wave
packet group velocity of v_g~0.017c which is attributed to the bandgap
renormalization originating in the light coupling near the exciton transition.
These findings suggest that vdW materials could be used for slow light with
applications in light storage for memory, enhanced optical nonlinearity,
sensing and more.

the reduced convex sub-problem, which is proven to always converge to the
optimal solution with global linear convergence rate and local quadratic

Bi$_2$Te$_3$ in three domains, rotated by 0$^{\circ}$, 120$^{\circ}$, and
240$^{\circ}$. This results in a superposition of photoemission intensity from
the domains, complicating the analysis. However, by combining bulk and thin

structure and an overall good agreement with first principles calculations,
assuming a p-doping shift of 65~meV for the bulk and a renormalization factor
of around 2. By tracking the change of substrate electronic structure upon film
growth, we find indications of an electron transfer from the FeTe film to the

is observed when alkali atoms are dosed onto the surface. This is ascribed to
the film's high density of states at the Fermi energy. This behavior is also
supported by the ab-initio calculations.

non-dissipative scalar field $\theta$ in unsteady Stokes flows. The objective
of our approach is to achieve optimal mixing at a given final time $T>0$, via
the active control of the flow velocity $v$ through boundary inputs. Due to the
zero diffusivity of the scalar field $\theta$, establishing the well-posedness
of its G\^{a}teaux derivative requires $\sup_{t\in[0,T]}\|\nabla
\theta\|_{L^2}<\infty$, which in turn demands the flow velocity field to
satisfy the condition $ \int^{T}_{0}\|\nabla v\|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}\,
dt<\infty$. This condition results in the need to penalize the time derivative
of the boundary control in the cost functional. As a result, the optimality
system becomes difficult to solve \cite{hu2017boundary}. Our current
approximating approach will provide a more transparent optimality system, with
the set of admissible controls being $L^{2}$ in both time and space. This is
achieved by first introducing a small diffusivity to the scalar equation and
then establishing a rigorous analysis of convergence of the approximating
control problem to the original one as the diffusivity approaches to zero.
Uniqueness of the optimal solution is obtained for the two dimensional case.

emergence of simultaneous upscale and downscale energy transfer. Indeed, both
numerics and experiments show the formation of large-scale anisotropic vortices
together with the development of small-scale dissipative structures. However
the organization of interactions leading to this complex dynamics remains
unclear. Two different mechanisms are known to be able to transfer energy
upscale in a turbulent flow. The first is characterized by two-dimensional
interactions among triads lying on the two-dimensional, three-component (2D3C)
manifold, namely on the Fourier plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. The
second mechanism is three-dimensional and consists of interactions between
triads with the same sign of helicity (homochiral). Here, we present a detailed
numerical study of rotating flows using a suite of high Reynolds number direct
numerical simulations within different parameter regimes to analyze both
upscale and downscale cascade ranges. We find that the upscale cascade at wave
numbers close to the forcing scale is generated by increasingly dominant
homochiral interactions which couple the three-dimensional bulk and the 2D3C
plane. This coupling produces an accumulation of energy in the 2D3C plane,
which then transfers energy to smaller wave numbers thanks to the
two-dimensional mechanism. In the forward cascade range, we find that the
energy transfer is dominated by heterochiral triads and is dominated primarily
by interaction within the fast manifold where $k_z\ne0$. We further analyze the
energy transfer in different regions in the real-space domain. In particular,
we distinguish high-strain from high-vorticity regions and we uncover that
while the mean transfer is produced inside regions of strain, the rare but
extreme events of energy transfer occur primarily inside the large-scale column
vortices.

automotive collision avoidance (also referred to as conflict detection in other
contexts). After reviewing existing approaches to the definition and
computation of a collision probability we argue that the question ""What is the
probability of collision within the next three seconds?"" can be answered on the
basis of a collision probability rate.
  Using results on level crossings for vector stochastic processes we derive a
general expression for the upper bound of the distribution of the collision
probability rate. This expression is valid for arbitrary prediction models
including process noise.
  We demonstrate in several examples that distributions obtained by large-scale
Monte-Carlo simulations obey this bound and in many cases approximately
saturate the bound. We derive an approximation for the distribution of the
collision probability rate that can be computed on an embedded platform. An
upper bound of the probability of collision is then obtained by one-dimensional
numerical integration over the time period of interest.
  A straightforward application of this method applies to the collision of an
extended object with a second point-like object. Using an abstraction of the
second object by salient points of its boundary we propose an application of
this method to two extended objects with arbitrary orientation.
  Finally, the distribution of the collision probability rate is compared to
approximations of time-to-collision distributions for one-dimensional motions
that have been obtained previously.

power-law scaling of total mass with temperature. Our goals are: i) to
determine parameters of the scaling between galaxy velocity dispersion and
X-ray temperature, $T_{\rm 300kpc}$, for the halos hosting XXL-selected
clusters, and; ii) to infer the log-mean scaling of total halo mass with
temperature, $\langle \ln M_{200} \, | \, T, z \rangle$. We apply an ensemble
velocity likelihood to a sample of $> 1500$ spectroscopic redshifts within
$132$ spectroscopically confirmed clusters with redshifts $z < 0.6$ to model,
$\langle \ln \sigma_{\rm gal}\,|\,T,z\rangle$, where $\sigma_{\rm gal}$ is the
velocity dispersion of XXL cluster member galaxies and $T$ is a 300 kpc
aperture temperature. To infer total halo mass we use a precise virial relation
for massive halos calibrated by N-body simulations along with a single degree
of freedom summarizing galaxy velocity bias with respect to dark matter. For
the XXL-N cluster sample, we find $\sigma_{\rm gal} \propto T^{0.63\pm0.05}$, a
slope significantly steeper than the self-similar expectation of $0.5$.
Assuming scale-independent galaxy velocity bias, we infer a mean logarithmic
mass at a given X-ray temperature and redshift, $\langle\ln (E(z)

$z_p=0.25$, with normalization $\pi=0.45\pm0.24$ and slope
$\alpha=1.89\pm0.15$. We obtain only weak constraints on redshift evolution,

and practical applications. In particular, in unidirectional drying, the
evaporation of the solvent induces flows which accumulate particles at the
liquid/air interface. The progressive build-up of a dense region of particles
can be used, in particular, in the processing of advanced materials and
architectures while the development of heterogeneities and defects in such
systems is critical to their function. A lot of attention has thus been paid to
correlate the flow and particles dynamics to the ordering of particles.
However, dynamic observation at the particle scale and its correlation with
local particle ordering are still missing. Here we show by measuring the
particle velocities with high frame rate laser scanning confocal microscopy
that the ordering of weakly Brownian particles during directional drying in a
Hele-Shaw cell opened on one side depends on the particle velocity. Under the
ambient and experimental conditions presented in the following, the particle
velocities accumulate in two branches. A higher degree of ordering is found for
the branch of faster particle velocity which we explain by an increase in the
pressure drop which drags the particles into a denser packing as the flow
velocity increases. This counter-intuitive behaviour is the opposite to what is
found with Brownian particles, which can reorganize by Brownian motion into
denser packing during drying, as long as the flow velocity is not too high.
These results show that different kinetic conditions can be used to obtain
dense, defect-free regions of particles after drying. In particular, it
suggests that rapid, directional drying could be used to control the
crystallinity of particle deposits.

pulses are applied to a series connection of the ferroelectric capacitor and a
resistor to directly measure the ferroelectric negative capacitance during
switching. A time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach is used to investigate the
underlying domain dynamics. The transient negative capacitance is shown to
originate from reverse domain nucleation and unrestricted domain growth.
However, with the onset of domain coalescence, the capacitance becomes positive
again. The persistence of the negative capacitance state is therefore limited
by the speed of domain wall motion. By changing the applied electric field,
capacitor area or external resistance, this domain wall velocity can be varied
predictably over several orders of magnitude. Additionally, detailed insights
into the intrinsic material properties of the ferroelectric are obtainable
through these measurements. A new method for reliable extraction of the average
negative capacitance of the ferroelectric is presented. Furthermore, a simple
analytical model is developed, which accurately describes the negative
capacitance transient time as a function of the material properties and the

balanced steady states in chemical reaction network theory. To this end, we
generalize the graph commonly used to represent a reaction network.
Specifically, we introduce a graph, called a reaction graph, that has one edge
for each reaction but potentially multiple nodes for each complex. A special
class of steady states, called node balanced steady states, is naturally
associated with such a reaction graph. We show that complex and detailed
balanced steady states are special cases of node balanced steady states by
choosing appropriate reaction graphs. Further, we show that node balanced
steady states have properties analogous to complex balanced steady states, such
as uniqueness and asymptotical stability in each stoichiometric compatibility
class. Moreover, we associate an integer, called the deficiency, to a reaction
graph that gives the number of independent relations in the reaction rate
constants that need to be satisfied for a positive node balanced steady state
to exist.
  The set of reaction graphs (modulo isomorphism) is equipped with a partial
order that has the complex balanced reaction graph as minimal element. We
relate this order to the deficiency and to the set of reaction rate constants
for which a positive node balanced steady state exists.

to shape the study of fairness in algorithmic decision-making. Algorithms
exhibit treatment disparity if they formally treat members of protected
subgroups differently; algorithms exhibit impact disparity when outcomes differ
across subgroups, even if the correlation arises unintentionally. Naturally, we
can achieve impact parity through purposeful treatment disparity. In one thread
of technical work, papers aim to reconcile the two forms of parity proposing
disparate learning processes (DLPs). Here, the learning algorithm can see group
membership during training but produce a classifier that is group-blind at test
time. In this paper, we show theoretically that: (i) When other features
correlate to group membership, DLPs will (indirectly) implement treatment
disparity, undermining the policy desiderata they are designed to address; (ii)
When group membership is partly revealed by other features, DLPs induce
within-class discrimination; and (iii) In general, DLPs provide a suboptimal
trade-off between accuracy and impact parity. Based on our technical analysis,
we argue that transparent treatment disparity is preferable to occluded methods
for achieving impact parity. Experimental results on several real-world
datasets highlight the practical consequences of applying DLPs vs. per-group
thresholds.

consideration for the exploration vs. exploitation framework that does not
arise in multi-armed bandits but is crucial in contextual bandits; the way
exploration and exploitation is conducted in the present affects the bias and
variance in the potential outcome model estimation in subsequent stages of
learning. We develop parametric and non-parametric contextual bandits that
integrate balancing methods from the causal inference literature in their
estimation to make it less prone to problems of estimation bias. We provide the
first regret bound analyses for contextual bandits with balancing in the domain
of linear contextual bandits that match the state of the art regret bounds. We
demonstrate the strong practical advantage of balanced contextual bandits on a
large number of supervised learning datasets and on a synthetic example that
simulates model mis-specification and prejudice in the initial training data.
Additionally, we develop contextual bandits with simpler assignment policies by
leveraging sparse model estimation methods from the econometrics literature and

general nonlocal. Thus if nuclear densities obtained from {\it ab initio}
no-core-shell-model (NCSM) calculations are to be used in reaction
calculations, translationally invariant nonlocal densities must be available.
[Purpose:] Though it is standard to extract translationally invariant one-body
local densities from NCSM calculations to calculate local nuclear observables
like radii and transition amplitudes, the corresponding nonlocal one-body
densities have not been considered so far. A major reason for this is that the
procedure for removing the center-of-mass component from NCSM wavefunctions up
to now has only been developed for local densities. [Results:] A formulation
for removing center-of-mass contributions from nonlocal one-body densities
obtained from NCSM and symmetry-adapted NCSM (SA-NCSM) calculations is derived,
and applied to the ground state densities of $^4$He, $^6$Li, $^{12}$C, and
$^{16}$O. The nonlocality is studied as a function of angular momentum
components in momentum as well as coordinate space [Conclusions:] We find that
the nonlocality for the ground state densities of the nuclei under
consideration increases as a function of the angular momentum. The relative
magnitude of those contributions decreases with increasing angular momentum. In
general, the nonlocal structure of the one-body density matrices we studied is
given by the shell structure of the nucleus, and can not be described with
simple functional forms.

Euclidean space. A regular simplex is a special type of ETF in which the number
of vectors is one more than the dimension of the space they span. In this
paper, we consider ETFs that contain a regular simplex, that is, have the
property that a subset of its vectors forms a regular simplex. As we explain,
such ETFs are characterized as those that achieve equality in a certain
well-known bound from the theory of compressed sensing. We then consider the
so-called binder of such an ETF, namely the set of all regular simplices that
it contains. We provide a new algorithm for computing this binder in terms of
products of entries of the ETF's Gram matrix. In certain circumstances, we show
this binder can be used to produce a particularly elegant Naimark complement of
the corresponding ETF. Other times, an ETF is a disjoint union of regular
simplices, and we show this leads to a certain type of optimal packing of
subspaces known as an equichordal tight fusion frame. We conclude by
considering the extent to which these ideas can be applied to numerous known
constructions of ETFs, including harmonic ETFs.

  Applications",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a nondecreasing function $f$ on $[-1,1]$, we investigate how well it
can be approximated by nondecreasing algebraic polynomials that interpolate it
at $\pm 1$. We establish pointwise estimates of the approximation error by such
polynomials that yield interpolation at the endpoints (i.e., the estimates
become zero at $\pm 1$). We call such estimates ""interpolatory estimates"".
  In 1985, DeVore and Yu were the first to obtain this kind of results for
monotone polynomial approximation.
  Their estimates involved the second modulus of smoothness $\omega_2(f,\cdot)$
of $f$ evaluated at $\sqrt{1-x^2}/n$ and were valid for all $n\ge1$.
  The current paper is devoted to proving that if $f\in C^r[-1,1]$, $r\ge1$,
then the interpolatory estimates are valid for the second modulus of smoothness
of $f^{(r)}$, however, only for $n\ge N$ with $N= N(f,r)$, since it is known
that such estimates are in general invalid with $N$ independent of $f$.
  Given a number $\alpha>0$, we write $\alpha=r+\beta$ where $r$ is a
nonnegative integer and $0<\beta\le1$, and denote by $Lip^*\alpha$ the class of
all functions $f$ on $[-1,1]$ such that $\omega_2(f^{(r)}, t) = O(t^\beta)$.
Then, one important corollary of the main theorem in this paper is the
following result that has been an open problem for $\alpha\geq 2$ since 1985:
  If $\alpha>0$, then a function $f$ is nondecreasing and in $Lip^*\alpha$, if
and only if, there exists a constant $C$ such that, for all sufficiently large
$n$, there are nondecreasing polynomials $P_n$, of degree $n$, such that \[
|f(x)-P_n(x)| \leq C \left(\frac{\sqrt{1-x^2}}{n}\right)^\alpha, \quad x\in
[-1,1]. \]

\lambda^{2}/(2^{d}\|S(g)\|_{\infty}^{2})}, \] where $S(g)$ denotes the
classical dyadic square function in $[0,1)^{d}$. The estimate is sharp when
dimension $d$ tends to infinity in the sense that the constant $2^{d}$ in the
denominator cannot be replaced by $C2^{d}$ with $0<C<1$ independent of $d$ when
$d \to \infty$.
  For $d=1$ this is a classical result of Chang--Wilson--Wolff [4]; however, in
the case $d>1$ they work with a special square function $S_\infty$, and their
result does not imply the estimates for the classical square function.
  Using good $\lambda$ inequalities technique we then obtain unweighted and
weighted $L^p$ lower bounds for $S$; to get the corresponding good $\lambda$
inequalities we need to modify the classical construction.
  We also show how to obtain our superexponential distribution inequality
(although with worse constants) from the weighted $L^2$ lower bounds for $S$,
obtained in [5].

femtoseconds, followed by torsional relaxation on a ~300 femtosecond time
scale. The second step is the driving force for exciton migration, as initial
conjugation breaks are removed by dynamical planarization. The quantum coherent
nature of the elementary exciton migration step is consistent with experimental
observations highlighting the correlated and vibrationally coherent nature of
the dynamics on ultrafast time scales.

  II-Solidification, Residual Stresses, and Modeling of the Nozzle","Accepted by Rapid Prototyping Journal",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose - This paper continues the development of a comprehensive methodology
for fully resolved numerical simulations of fusion deposition modeling.
Design/methodology/approach - A front-tracking/finite volume method introduced
in Part I to simulate the heat transfer and fluid dynamics of the deposition of
a polymer filament on a fixed bed is extended by adding an improved model for
the injection nozzle, including the shrinkage of the polymer as it cools down,
and accounting for stresses in the solid. Findings - The accuracy and
convergence properties of the new method are tested by grid refinement and the
method is shown to produce convergent solutions for the shape of the filament,
the temperature distribution, the shrinkage and the solid stresses. Research
limitations/implications - The method presented in the paper focuses on
modeling the fluid flow, the cooling and solidification, as well as volume
changes and residual stresses, using a relatively simple viscoelastic
constitutive model. More complex material models, depending, for example, on
the evolution of the configuration tensor, are not included. Practical
implications - The ability to carry out fully resolved numerical simulations of
the fusion deposition process is expected to be critical for the validation of
mathematical models for the material behavior, to help explore new deposition
strategies, and to provide the ""ground truth"" for the development of reduced
order models. Originality/value - The paper completes the development of the
first numerical method for fully resolved simulation of fusion filament
modeling.

energetic hot carriers can be extracted from the metal-semiconductor interface

extraction upon plasmon decay using such an interface has been argued to occur
after the formation of an intermediate electron population with a uniform
momentum distribution. The efficiency of the charge separation process is thus
discussed to be limited by this spatial homogeneity in certain plasmon-induced
applications. Here we demonstrate using visible pump, near-infrared probe
transient absorption spectroscopy that increases in the contact area between
metal and semiconductor leads to an increase in the quantum yield for hot
electron injection that is inconsistent with the homogeneous energy-momentum

as He concentration is varied in ion-ITB type experiments, having constant
electron density and input heating power but with a clear increase of central
ion temperature in He rich discharges. This activity consists of bursty, but
damped energetic interchange modes (EICs, X Du et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114
p.155003 (2015)), whose occurrence rate is dramatically lower in the He-rich
discharges. Mechanisms are discussed for the changes in drive and damping of
the modes with He concentration. These EIC bursts consist of marked changes in
the radial electric field, which is derived from the phase velocity of
turbulence measured with the 2D phase contrast imaging (PCI) system. Similar
bursts are detected in edge fast ion diagnostics. Ion thermal transport by
gyro-Bohm scaling is recognised as a contribution to the change in ion
temperature, though fast ion losses by these EIC modes may also contribute to
the ion temperature dependence on He concentration, most particularly
controlling the height of an ""edge-pedestal"" in the $T_{i}$ profile. The
steady-state level of fast ions is shown to be larger in Helium rich discharges
on the basis of a compact neutral particle analyser (CNPA), and the fast-ion
component of the diamagnetic stored energy. These events also have an influence
on turbulence and transport. The large velocity shear induced produced during
these events transiently improves confinement and suppresses turbulence, and
has a larger net effect when bursts are more frequent in Hydrogen discharges.
This exactly offsets the increased gyro-Bohm related turbulence drive in
Hydrogen which results in the same time-averaged turbulence level in Hydrogen
as in Helium.

hydrogen-air mixture. Numerical analysis of the problem shows the possibility
of the stable self-sustained flame ball existence in unconfined space on
sufficiently large spatial scales. The structure of the flame ball is
determined by the convection processes related to the hot products rising in
the terrestrial gravity field. It is shown that the structure of the flame ball
corresponds to the axisymmetric structures of the gaseous bubble in the liquid.
In addition to the stable flame core, there are satellite burning kernels
separated from the original flameball and developing inside the thermal wake
behind the propagating flame ball. The effective area of burning expands with
time due to flame ball and satellite kernels development. Both stable flame
ball existence in the ultra-lean mixture and increase in the burning area
indicate the possibility of transition to rapid deflagrative combustion as soon
as the flame ball enters the region filled with hydrogen-air mixture of the
richer composition. Such a scenario is intrinsic to the natural spatial
distribution of hydrogen in the conditions of terrestrial gravity and therefore
it is crucial to take it into account in elaborating risk assessments
techniques and prevention measures.

problem based on the principle that any regularity in a given dataset can be

introducing the noisy lossy source coding paradigm with the log-loss fidelity
criterion which provides the fundamental tradeoffs between the
\emph{cross-entropy loss} (average risk) and the information rate of the
features (model complexity). Our approach allows an information theoretic
formulation of the \emph{multi-task learning} (MTL) problem which is a
supervised learning framework in which the prediction models for several
related tasks are learned jointly from common representations to achieve better
generalization performance. Then, we present an iterative algorithm for
computing the optimal tradeoffs and its global convergence is proven provided
that some conditions hold. An important property of this algorithm is that it
provides a natural safeguard against overfitting, because it minimizes the
average risk taking into account a penalization induced by the model
complexity. Remarkably, empirical results illustrate that there exists an
optimal information rate minimizing the \emph{excess risk} which depends on the
nature and the amount of available training data. An application to
hierarchical text categorization is also investigated, extending previous
works.

an elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) sheet between two more rigid layers and

as little as 20 mW of power. We investigate this mechanism and establish design
rules by varying dimensions, configurations, and materials. We show the

the computer-assisted image processing goes with the combination of five 3D

essentially on accuracy maximization, but recent work has shown that
economically irrational and socially unacceptable scenarios of discrimination
and unfairness are likely to arise unless these issues are explicitly
addressed. This undesirable behavior has several possible sources, such as
biased datasets used for training that may not be detected in black-box models.

logical theory of preferences. An AI model can be preferred over others on
purely rational grounds after one or more attempts at refutation based on
accuracy and fairness. Inspired by such epistemological principles, this paper
proposes a structured approach to mitigate discrimination and unfairness caused
by bias in AI systems. In the proposed computational framework, models are
selected and enhanced after attempts at refutation. To illustrate our

Tidal detonation is also a WD explosion induced by a TDE. In this case, helium
(He) and carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation waves incinerate He~WD and CO~WD,
respectively. On the other hand, for tidal double detonation, He detonation is
first excited in the He shell of a CO~WD, and drives CO detonation in the CO
core. We name this mechanism after the double detonation scenario in the
context of type Ia supernovae. In this paper, we show tidal double detonation
occurs in shallower encounter of a CO~WD with an intermediate mass black hole
(IMBH) than simple tidal detonation, performing numerical simulations for
CO~WDs with $0.60M_\odot$ with and without a He shell. We expect tidal double
detonation spreads opportunity to WD~TDEs illuminating IMBHs.

learning based framework to yield pDECT images from SECT images, utilizing the
intrinsic characteristics underlying DECT images, i.e., global correlation and
high similarity. To demonstrate the performance of the deep learning based
framework, a cascade deep ConvNet (CD-ConvNet) approach is specifically
presented in the deep learning framework. In the training step, the CD-ConvNet
is designed to learn the non-linear mapping from the measured energy-specific
(i.e., low-energy) CT images to the desired energy-specific (i.e., high-energy)
CT images. In the testing step, the trained CD-ConvNet can be used to yield
desired high-energy CT images from the low-energy CT images, and then produce
accurate basic material maps. Clinical patient data were employed to validate
and evaluate the presented CD-ConvNet approach performance. Both visual and

high quality pDECT images and basic material maps.

securest encryption methods, and the key distribution problem can be solved by
using the QKD (quantum key distribution). The objective of this project is to
design an Android APP (application) to exchange several random keys between
mobile phones. Inspired by QKD, the developed APP uses the quick response (QR)
code as a carrier to dispatch large amounts of one-time keys. After evaluating
the performance of APP, it allows the mobile phone to capture and decode 1800
bytes of random data in 600ms. The continuous scanning mode of APP is designed
to improve the overall transmission performance and user experience, and the
maximum transmission rate of this mode is around 2200 bytes/s. The
omnidirectional readability and error correction capability of QR code gives it
better real-life application, and the features of adequate storage capacity and
quick response optimize overall transmission efficiency. The security of this
APP is guaranteed since QR code is exchanged face-to-face, eliminating the risk
of being eavesdropped. Also, the id of QR code is the only message that would
be transmitted through the whole communication. The experimental results show
this project can achieve superior transmission performance, and the correlation
between the transmission rate of the system and several parameters, such as the
QR code size, has been analyzed. In addition, some existing technologies and

maximum permissible exposure in the wavelength ranging from 0.3 um to 10 um,
the eye-safe 1.5 um lidar can be deployed in urban areas. In such a case, the
measured extinction coefficient at 1.5 um should be converted to that at 0.55
um for visibility retrieval. Although several models have been established
since 1962, the accurate wavelength conversion remains a challenge. An adaptive
inversion algorithm for 1.5 um visibility lidar is proposed and demonstrated by
using the in situ Angstrom wavelength exponent, which is derived from either a
sun photometer or an aerosol spectrometer. The impact of the particle size
distribution of atmospheric aerosols and the Rayleigh backscattering of
atmospheric molecules are taken into account. In comparison, the Angstrom
wavelength exponent derived from the sun photometer is 7.7% higher than that
derived from the aerosol spectrometer. Then, using 1.5 um visibility lidar, the
visibility with a temporal resolution of 5 min is detected over 48 hours in
Hefei (31.83 N, 117.25 E). The average visibility error between the new method
and a visibility sensor (Vaisala, PWD52) is 5.2% with the R-square value of

  Principles of Distributed Systems",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the topological study of distributed systems, the immediate snapshot is
the fundamental computation block for the topological characterization of
wait-free solvable tasks. However, in reality, the immediate snapshot is not
available as a native built-in operation on shared memory distributed systems.
Borowsky and Gafni have proposed a wait-free multi-round protocol that
implements the immediate snapshot using more primitive operations, namely the
atomic reads and writes.
  In this paper, up to an appropriate reformulation on the original protocol by
Borowsky and Gafni, we establish a tight link between each round of the
protocol and a topological operation of subdivision using Schlegel diagram. Due
to the fact shown by Kozlov that the standard chromatic subdivision is obtained
by iterated subdivision using Schlegel diagram, the reformulated version is
proven to compute the immediate snapshot in a topologically smoother way. We
also show that the reformulated protocol is amenable to optimization: Since
each round restricts the possible candidates of output to an iteratively
smaller region of finer subdivision, each process executing the protocol can
decide at an earlier round, beyond which the same final output is reached no
matter how the remaining rounds are executed. This reduces the number of read
and write operations involved in the overall execution of the protocol,
relieving the bottleneck of access to shared memory.

require precise knowledge of the true data generating mechanisms. As such,
numerous authors have advocated for ML methods to estimate causal effects.
Unfortunately, ML algorithms can perform worse than parametric regression. We
demonstrate the performance of ML-based single- and double-robust estimators.
We use 100 Monte Carlo samples with sample sizes of 200, 1200, and 5000 to
investigate bias and confidence interval coverage under several scenarios. In a
simple confounding scenario, confounders were related to the treatment and the
outcome via parametric models. In a complex confounding scenario, the simple
confounders were transformed to induce complicated nonlinear relationships. In
the simple scenario, when ML algorithms were used, double-robust estimators
were superior to single-robust estimators. In the complex scenario,
single-robust estimators with ML algorithms were at least as biased as
estimators using misspecified parametric models. Double-robust estimators were
less biased, but coverage was well below nominal. The use of sample splitting,
inclusion of confounder interactions, reliance on a richly specified ML
algorithm, and use of doubly robust estimators was the only explored approach
that yielded negligible bias and nominal coverage. Our results suggest that ML
based singly robust methods should be avoided.

important role. However, most known constructions are over large fields with

expensive. Due to this, binary LRCs are of interest in practice. In this paper,
we focus on binary linear LRCs with disjoint repair groups. We first derive an
explicit bound for the dimension k of such codes, which can be served as a
generalization of the bounds given in [11, 36, 37]. We also give several new
constructions of binary LRCs with minimum distance $d = 6$ based on weakly
independent sets and partial spreads, which are optimal with respect to our
newly obtained bound. In particular, for locality $r\in \{2,3\}$ and minimum

Here, we study the spin dynamics for binaries with a distant black hole
companion. For spins initially aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the
binary, we find that $\chi_{\rm eff}$ ""freezes"" near zero as the orbit decays
through the emission of gravitational waves. Through a population study, we
show that this process predominantly leads to merging black hole binaries with
near-zero $\chi_{\rm eff}$. We conclude that if the detected black hole
binaries were formed in triples, then this would explain their low $\chi_{\rm
eff}$ without the need to invoke near-zero spins or initially large spin-orbit
angles.

wavefronts rapidly separates from RPWs and move towards umbral center, wherein
they expand radially outwards suggesting the beginning of a new umbral

develop further into RPWs. We speculate that the waveguides of running waves
are twisted in spiral structures and hence the wavefronts are first seen at
high latitudes of umbral boundaries and later at lower latitudes of the umbral

mathematics curriculum. A particular difficult task is to add auxiliary
constructions (i.e, additional lines or points) to aid proof discovery.
Although there exist many intelligent tutoring systems proposed for geometry
proofs, few teach students how to find auxiliary constructions. And the few
exceptions are all limited by their underlying reasoning processes for
supporting auxiliary constructions. This paper tackles these weaknesses of
prior systems by introducing an interactive geometry tutor, the Advanced
Geometry Proof Tutor (AGPT). It leverages a recent automated geometry prover to
provide combined benefits that any geometry theorem prover or intelligent
tutoring system alone cannot accomplish. In particular, AGPT not only can
automatically process images of geometry problems directly, but also can
interactively train and guide students toward discovering auxiliary
constructions on their own. We have evaluated AGPT via a pilot study with 78
high school students. The study results show that, on training students how to
find auxiliary constructions, there is no significant perceived difference

from a gallery that contains images of multiple people obtained from a
multi-camera system. Many challenges such as occlusions, drastic lighting and
pose variations across the camera views, indiscriminate visual appearances,
cluttered backgrounds, imperfect detections, motion blur, and noise make this
task highly challenging. While most approaches focus on learning features and
metrics to derive better representations, we hypothesize that both local and
global contextual cues are crucial for an accurate identity matching. To this
end, we propose a Feature Mask Network (FMN) that takes advantage of ResNet
high-level features to predict a feature map mask and then imposes it on the
low-level features to dynamically reweight different object parts for a locally
aware feature representation. This serves as an effective attention mechanism
by allowing the network to focus on local details selectively. Given the
resemblance of person re-identification with classification and retrieval
tasks, we frame the network training as a multi-task objective optimization,
which further improves the learned feature descriptions. We conduct experiments
on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets, where the proposed approach
respectively achieves significant improvements of $5.3\%$, $9.1\%$ and $10.7\%$

orders of magnitude for a centimeter diameter lens) and stepper

initialised on a two-dimensional surface, act to close an artificial wound
space. While real wounds have different shapes, standard wound healing assays
often deal with just one simple wound shape, and it is unclear whether varying
the wound shape might impact how we interpret results from these experiments.
In this work, we describe a new kind of wound healing assay, called a sticker
assay, that allows us to examine the role of wound shape in a series of wound
healing assays performed with fibroblast cells. In particular, we show how to
use the sticker assay to examine wound healing with square, circular and
triangular shaped wounds. We take a standard approach and report measurements
of the size of the wound as a function of time. This shows that the rate of
wound closure depends on the initial wound shape. This result is interesting
because the only aspect of the assay that we change is the initial wound shape,
and the reason for the different rate of wound closure is unclear. To provide
more insight into the experimental observations we describe our results
quantitatively by calibrating a mathematical model, describing the relevant
transport phenomena, to match our experimental data. Overall, our results
suggest that the rates of cell motility and cell proliferation from different
initial wound shapes are approximately the same, implying that the differences
we observe in the wound closure rate are consistent with a fairly typical
mathematical model of wound healing. Our results imply that parameter estimates
obtained from an experiment performed with one particular wound shape could be
used to describe an experiment performed with a different shape. This
fundamental result is important because this assumption is often invoked, but
never tested.

that can be difficult to capture by only considering its syntax (i.e.
syntactically similar pro- grams can exhibit vastly different run-time

This paper proposes a novel semantic program embedding that is learned from
program execution traces. Our key insight is that program states expressed as
sequential tuples of live variable values not only captures program semantics
more precisely, but also offer a more natural fit for Recurrent Neural Networks
to model. We evaluate different syntactic and semantic program embeddings on
predicting the types of errors that students make in their submissions to an

significantly outperforms the syntactic program embeddings based on token

and Chikungunya. Due to modifications in weather patterns, its geographical
range is continuously evolving. Temperature is a key factor for its expansion
into regions with cool winters, but rainfall can also have a strong impact on
the colonization of these regions, since larvae emerging after a rainfall are
likely to die at temperatures below $10^{\circ}$C. As climate change is
expected to affect rainfall regimes, with a higher frequency of heavy storms
and an increase in drought-affected areas, it is important to understand how
different rainfall scenarios may shape Ae. aegypti's range. We develop a model
for the population dynamics of Ae. aegypti, coupled with a rainfall model to
study the effect of the temporal distribution of rainfall on mosquito
abundance. Using a fracturing process, we then investigate the effect of a
higher variability in the daily rainfall. As an example, we show that rainfall
distribution is necessary to explain the geographic range of Ae. aegypti in
Taiwan, an island characterized by rainy winters in the north and dry winters
in the south. We also predict that a higher variability in the rainfall time
distribution will decrease the maximum abundance of Ae. aegypti during the
summer. An increase in daily rainfall variability will likewise enhance its
extinction probability. Finally, we obtain a nonlinear relationship between dry
season duration and extinction probability. These findings can have a
significant impact on our ability to predict disease outbreaks.

SrMnSb$_2$ possesses a small Fermi surface originating from highly 2D, sharp

$k$-space. The ARPES Fermi surface agrees perfectly with that from
bulk-sensitive Shubnikov de Haas data from the same crystals, proving the
Y$-$states to be responsible for electrical conductivity in SrMnSb$_2$. DFT and
tight binding (TB) methods are used to model the electronic states, and both
show good agreement with the ARPES data. Despite the great promise of the
latter, both theory approaches show the Y-states to be gapped above E$_F$,
suggesting trivial topology. Subsequent analysis within both theory approaches
shows the Berry phase to be zero, indicating the non-topological character of
the transport in SrMnSb$_2$, a conclusion backed up by the analysis of the
quantum oscillation data from our crystals.

planetary upper atmosphere, which is driven by stellar XUV, and its interaction
with the stellar wind has been performed. The model selfconsistently describes
the escaping planetary wind, taking into account the generation of ENAs due to
particle acceleration by the radiation pressure and by the charge exchange
between the stellar wind protons and planetary atoms. The calculations in a
wide range of stellar wind parameters and XUV flux values showed that under
typical Sun-like star conditions, the amount of generated ENAs is too small,
and the observed absorption at the level of 6-8 percent can be attributed only
to the non-resonant natural line broadening. For lower XUV fluxes, e.g., during
the activity minima, the number of planetary atoms that survive photoionization
and give rise to ENAs increases, resulting in up to 10-15 percent absorption at
the blue wing of the Lya line, caused by resonant thermal line broadening. A
similar asymmetric absorption can be seen under the conditions realized during
coronal mass ejections, when sufficiently high stellar wind pressure confines
the escaping planetary material within a kind of bowshock around the planet. It
was found that the radiation pressure in all considered cases has a negligible
contribution to the production of ENAs and the corresponding absorption.

abundance of data. However, collecting large-scale data is not always possible,
especially for the supervised labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims
to utilize labeled data from a source domain to learn a model that generalizes
to a target domain of unlabeled data. A large amount of existing work uses
Siamese network-based models, where two streams of neural networks process the
source and the target domain data respectively. Nevertheless, most of these
approaches focus on minimizing the domain discrepancy, overlooking the
importance of preserving the discriminative ability for target domain features.
Another important problem in UDA research is how to evaluate the methods
properly. Common evaluation procedures require target domain labels for
hyper-parameter tuning and model selection, contradicting the definition of the
UDA task. Hence we propose a more reasonable evaluation principle that avoids
this contradiction by simply adopting the latest snapshot of a model for
evaluation. This adds an extra requirement for UDA methods besides the main
performance criteria: the stability during training. We design a novel method
that connects the target domain stream to the source domain stream with a
Parameter Reference Loss (PRL) to solve these problems simultaneously.
Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed PRL not only improves
the performance on the target domain, but also stabilizes the training
procedure. As a result, PRL based models do not need the contradictory model
selection, and thus are more suitable for practical applications.

long-term radial velocity (RV) variations of K-type giants and to confirm
planetary companions around the stars.
  Methods. We have conducted two planet search programs by precise RV
measurement using the 1.8 m telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy
Observatory (BOAO) and the 1.88 m telescope at Okayama Astrophysical
Observatory (OAO). The BOAO program searches for planets around 55 early K
giants. The OAO program is looking for 190 G-K type giants.
  Results. In this paper, we report the detection of long-period RV variations
of three K giant stars, HD 40956, HD 111591, and HD 113996. We investigated the
cause of the observed RV variations and conclude the substellar companions are
most likely the cause of the RV variations. The orbital analyses yield P =

challenging problem of predicting inhomogeneous vertical and horizontal
chemical element distributions in the atmospheres of magnetic ApBp stars. Here
we critically assess the most sophisticated of such diffusion models - based on
a time-dependent treatment of the atomic diffusion in a magnetised stellar
atmosphere - by direct comparison with observations as well by testing the
widely used surface mapping tools with the spectral line profiles predicted by
this theory. We show that the mean abundances of Fe and Cr are grossly
underestimated by the time-dependent theoretical diffusion model, with
discrepancies reaching a factor of 1000 for Cr. We also demonstrate that
Doppler imaging inversion codes, based either on modelling of individual metal
lines or line-averaged profiles simulated according to theoretical
three-dimensional abundance distribution, are able to reconstruct correct
horizontal chemical spot maps despite ignoring the vertical abundance
variation. These numerical experiments justify a direct comparison of the
empirical two-dimensional Doppler maps with theoretical diffusion calculations.
This comparison is generally unfavourable for the current diffusion theory, as
very few chemical elements are observed to form overabundance rings in the
horizontal field regions as predicted by the theory and there are numerous
examples of element accumulations in the vicinity of radial field zones, which
cannot be explained by diffusion calculations.

of understanding the working mechanism of deep neural networks. Most existing
approaches generated perturbations in the image space, i.e., each pixel can be
modified independently. However, in this paper we pay special attention to the
subset of adversarial examples that correspond to meaningful changes in 3D
physical properties (like rotation and translation, illumination condition,
etc.). These adversaries arguably pose a more serious concern, as they
demonstrate the possibility of causing neural network failure by easy
perturbations of real-world 3D objects and scenes.
  In the contexts of object classification and visual question answering, we
augment state-of-the-art deep neural networks that receive 2D input images with
a rendering module (either differentiable or not) in front, so that a 3D scene
(in the physical space) is rendered into a 2D image (in the image space), and
then mapped to a prediction (in the output space). The adversarial
perturbations can now go beyond the image space, and have clear meanings in the
3D physical world. Though image-space adversaries can be interpreted as
per-pixel albedo change, we verify that they cannot be well explained along
these physically meaningful dimensions, which often have a non-local effect.
But it is still possible to successfully attack beyond the image space on the
physical space, though this is more difficult than image-space attacks,
reflected in lower success rates and heavier perturbations required.

the dot-edge localized SWs in a vortex state and vanishes in skyrmion states.
Furthermore, channeling of the azimuthal SWs localized at the skyrmion edge is
present and induces large frequency splitting. This is attributed to DMI
induced nonreciprocity, while coupling of the breathing and gyrotropic modes is
related to soliton motion. Finally, an efficient coupling of the dynamic

formation and evolution. Although the IMF is often assumed to be universal,
there is continuing evidence that it is not universal. Spectroscopic studies
that derive the IMF of the unresolved stellar populations of a galaxy often
assume that this spectrum can be described by a single stellar population
(SSP). To alleviate these limitations, in this paper we have developed a unique
hierarchical Bayesian framework for modelling composite stellar populations
(CSPs). Within this framework we use a parameterized IMF prior to regulate a
direct inference of the IMF. We use this new framework to determine the number
of SSPs that is required to fit a set of realistic CSP mock spectra. The CSP
mock spectra that we use are based on semi-analytic models and have an IMF that
varies as a function of stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy. Our results
suggest that using a single SSP biases the determination of the IMF slope to a
higher value than the true slope, although the trend with stellar velocity
dispersion is overall recovered. If we include more SSPs in the fit, the
Bayesian evidence increases significantly and the inferred IMF slopes of our
mock spectra converge, within the errors, to their true values. Most of the
bias is already removed by using two SSPs instead of one. We show that we can
reconstruct the variable IMF of our mock spectra for signal-to-noise ratios

pseudospectral method for the Dirac equation by splitting the Dirac equation
into two parts together with using the double commutator between them to
integrate the Dirac equation at each time interval. The method is explicit,
fourth-order in time and spectral order in space. It is unconditional stable
and conserves the total density in the discretized level. It is called a
compact time-splitting method since, at each time step, the number of sub-steps
in $S_\text{4c}$ is much less than those of the standard fourth-order splitting
method and the fourth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta splitting method.
Comparison among $S_\text{4c}$ and many other existing time-splitting methods
for the Dirac equation are carried out in terms of accuracy and efficiency as
well as long time behavior. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage in
terms of efficiency and accuracy of the proposed $S_\text{4c}$. Finally we
report the spatial/temporal resolutions of $S_\text{4c}$ for the Dirac equation
in different parameter regimes including the nonrelativistic limit regime, the
semiclassical limit regime, and the simultaneously nonrelativisic and massless
limit regime.

liquid-like behavior. While much progress has been made to understand their
elastic (small strain) and flow (infinite strain) properties, such
understanding is lacking for the softening and yielding phenomena that connect
these asymptotic regimes. Here we present a comprehensive framework for
softening and yielding of soft glassy materials, based on extensive numerical
simulations of oscillatory rheological tests, and show that two distinct
scenarios unfold depending on the material's packing density. For dense
systems, there is a single, pressure-independent strain where the elastic
modulus drops and the particle motion becomes diffusive. In contrast, for
weakly jammed systems, a two-step process arises: at an intermediate softening
strain, the elastic and loss moduli both drop down and then reach a new plateau
value, whereas the particle motion becomes diffusive at the distinctly larger
yield strain. We show that softening is associated with an extensive number of
microscopic contact changes leading to a non-analytic rheological signature.
Moreover, the scaling of the softening strain with pressure suggest the
existence of a novel pressure scale above which softening and yielding
coincide, and we verify the existence of this crossover scale numerically. Our
findings thus evidence the existence of two distinct classes of soft glassy
materials -- jamming dominated and dense -- and show how these can be
distinguished by their rheological fingerprint.

been always one of the interesting issues in real high-density physical
systems, where the relativistic and quantum effects due to spin can be
important. This paper discusses the case where plasma is not strongly coupled
but is still in regimes where a classic plasma description is not fully
adequate. The length scale of the plasma can be larger than the de-Broglie
length so that the quantum effects relevance to the spin can be significant. In
addition, the only relativistic effects are due to the electrons spin, for
example the spin-orbit coupling effect (the weak (semi) relativistic effects).
Obtained results imply that these effects can not be important in the ICF
subjects while these can lead to significant results in the astrophysical
subjects because of the strong magnetic fields. It is found that the weakly
relativistic effects can cover the magnetic dipole force and the spin
precession effects so that the growth rate of the instability can increase
compared to the non relativistic spin polarized cases. Indeed, it is expected
that the probability of electron capture in the background magnetic fields and
the particle energy dissipation will be reduced so that there will be a high

develop a set of techniques that yield new efficient algorithms with

  {\bf List-Decodable Mean Estimation.} Fix any $d \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and $0<
\alpha <1/2$. We design an algorithm with runtime $O
(\mathrm{poly}(n/\alpha)^{d})$ that outputs a list of $O(1/\alpha)$ many
candidate vectors such that with high probability one of the candidates is
within $\ell_2$-distance $O(\alpha^{-1/(2d)})$ from the true mean. The only
previous algorithm for this problem achieved error $\tilde O(\alpha^{-1/2})$
under second moment conditions. For $d = O(1/\epsilon)$, our algorithm runs in
polynomial time and achieves error $O(\alpha^{\epsilon})$. We also give a
Statistical Query lower bound suggesting that the complexity of our algorithm
is qualitatively close to best possible.
  {\bf Learning Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians.} We give a learning algorithm
for mixtures of spherical Gaussians that succeeds under significantly weaker
separation assumptions compared to prior work. For the prototypical case of a
uniform mixture of $k$ identity covariance Gaussians we obtain: For any
$\epsilon>0$, if the pairwise separation between the means is at least
$\Omega(k^{\epsilon}+\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)})$, our algorithm learns the unknown
parameters within accuracy $\delta$ with sample complexity and running time
$\mathrm{poly} (n, 1/\delta, (k/\epsilon)^{1/\epsilon})$. The previously best
known polynomial time algorithm required separation at least $k^{1/4}
\mathrm{polylog}(k/\delta)$.
  Our main technical contribution is a new technique, using degree-$d$

the Northern Hemisphere. The highly significant cosmic neutrino excess observed
by the Antarctic IceCube detector can be studied with ANTARES, exploiting its
complementing field of view, exposure, and lower energy threshold. Searches for
an all-flavor diffuse neutrino signal, covering 9 years of ANTARES data taking,
are presented in this letter. Upward-going events are used to reduce the
atmospheric muon background. This work includes for the first time in ANTARES
both track-like (mainly $\nu_\mu)$ and shower-like (mainly $\nu_e$) events in
this kind of analysis. Track-like events allow for an increase of the effective
volume of the detector thanks to the long path traveled by muons in rock and/or
sea water. Shower-like events are well reconstructed only when the neutrino
interaction vertex is close to, or inside, the instrumented volume. A mild
excess of high-energy events over the expected background is observed in 9
years of ANTARES data in both samples. The best fit for a single power-law
cosmic neutrino spectrum, in terms of per-flavor flux at 100 TeV, is
$\Phi_0^{1f}(100\ \textrm{TeV}) = \left(1.7\pm 1.0\right)

in the laboratory by mimicking an accretion disk threaded by a poloidal
magnetic field with concentric planar electrodes in front of a solenoidal coil.
The unique setup consists of three electrodes, each with azimuthally symmetric
gas slits. Two of the electrodes are biased independently with respect to the
third electrode to control the radial electric field profile across the
poloidal bias magnetic field. This design approximates a shear azimuthal
rotation profile in an accretion disk. The azimuthally symmetric gas slits
provide a continuously symmetric mass source at the footpoint of the plasma
jet, so any azimuthal rotation of the plasma jet is not hindered by a discrete
number of gas holes. The initial set of diagnostics consists of current
Rogowski coils, voltage probes, magnetic field probe arrays, an interferometer

azimuthally symmetric mass sources in the experiment successfully produces
short-lived (10 {\mu}s, >5 Alfv\'en times) collimated magnetic jets with ~10:1

optimization algorithm, and have shown empirically good performance in solving
various real-word optimization problems. During the past two decades, promising
results on the running time analysis (one essential theoretical aspect) of EAs
have been obtained, while most of them focused on isolated combinatorial
optimization problems, which do not reflect the general-purpose nature of EAs.
To provide a general theoretical explanation of the behavior of EAs, it is
desirable to study their performance on general classes of combinatorial
optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, the only result towards
this direction is the provably good approximation guarantees of EAs for the
problem class of maximizing monotone submodular functions with matroid
constraints. The aim of this work is to contribute to this line of research.
Considering that many combinatorial optimization problems involve non-monotone
or non-submodular objective functions, we study the general problem classes,
maximizing submodular functions with/without a size constraint and maximizing
monotone approximately submodular functions with a size constraint. We prove
that a simple multi-objective EA called GSEMO-C can generally achieve good
approximation guarantees in polynomial expected running time.

relaxation patterns change from multi-timescale relaxation for samples grown at
temperatures below the amorphous-crystalline transition temperature to single
exponential recovery for samples grown above the transition temperature. The
slow-relaxation contribution seen in cold-grown samples exhibits a temperature
dependence, and becomes even slower after the sample is annealed at 200K. The
fast-relaxation contribution seen in these samples, does not seem to change or
disappear even when heating to temperatures where the sample is evaporated. The
possibility that the fast relaxation component is linked to the microporous

metamorphosis equations of image analysis, in the geometrical context of the
Euler-Poincar\'e theory. In the metamorphosis of images, the Lie group of
diffeomorphisms deforms a template image that is undergoing its own internal
dynamics as it deforms. This type of deformation allows more freedom for image
matching and has analogies with complex fluids when the template properties are
regarded as order parameters (coset spaces of broken symmetries). The first
stochastic perturbation we consider corresponds to uncertainty due to random
errors in the reconstruction of the deformation map from its vector field. We
also consider a second stochastic perturbation, which compounds the uncertainty
in of the deformation map with the uncertainty in the reconstruction of the
template position from its velocity field. We apply this general geometric
theory to several classical examples, including landmarks, images, and closed
curves, and we discuss its use for functional data analysis.

nanoparticles in the biological environment. The effects of the irradiation on
the biological medium depend critically on the heat transfer process at the
nanoparticle interface, on the temperature reached by the tissues as well as on
the spatial extent of temperature gradients. Unfortunately, both the
temperature and its biological effects are difficult to be probed
experimentally at the molecular scale. Here, we approach this problem using
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on photoporation, a
photothermal application based on the irradiation of gold nanoparticles by
single, short-duration laser pulses. The nanoparticles, stably bound to cell
membranes, convert the radiation into heat, inducing transient changes of
membrane permeability. We make a quantitative prediction of the temperature
gradient around the nanoparticle upon irradiation by typical experimental laser
fluences. Water permeability is locally enhanced around the NP, in an annular
region that extends only a few nm far from the nanoparticle interface. We
correlate the local enhancement of permeability at the NP-lipid interface to
the temperature inhomogeneities of the membrane and to the consequent
availability of free volume pockets within the membrane core.

features extraction from multiple ROIs, we design an effective ROI mapping
strategy. The proposed tracker also provides flexibility to couple with the
more advanced correlation filter trackers. The DeepHKCF tracker performs
exceptionally well with deep features set up in a synthetic hyperspectral video
generated by the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG)

are born in clusters, their disks are not only irradiated by their parent star

to quantify the impact of X-ray background fields produced by young embedded
clusters on the chemical structure of disks. Further, we want to investigate
the importance of the dust for X-ray radiative transfer in disks.
  We present a new X-ray radiative transfer module for the radiation
thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo, which includes X-ray scattering and
absorption by both the gas and dust component. For the X-ray radiative
transfer, we consider irradiation by the star and by X-ray background fields.
To study the impact of X-rays on the chemical structure of disks we use the
well-established disk ionization tracers N2H+ and HCO+.
  For evolved dust populations, X-ray opacities are mostly dominated by the
gas; only for photon energies $E\gtrsim5-10\,$keV, dust opacities become
relevant. Consequently, the local disk X-ray radiation field is only affected
in dense regions close to the disk midplane. X-ray background fields can
dominate the local X-ray disk ionization rate for disk radii $r\gtrsim20\,$au.
However, the N2H+ and HCO+ column densities are only significantly affected in
case of low cosmic-ray ionization rates, or if the background flux is at least
a factor of ten higher than the flux level expected for clusters typical for
the solar vicinity. Observable signatures of X-ray background fields in
low-mass star-formation regions, like Taurus, are only expected for cluster
members experiencing a strong X-ray background field. For the majority of the
cluster members, the X-ray background field has only little impact on the disk
chemical structure.

theory (DFT). Calculations based both on molecular models and with periodic

from pyrene (pyrene-2C) which was then expanded to circumpyrene-2C. The
structural characterization of these cases revealed that the ground state is
slightly non-planar, with the bonding carbons displaced from the plane by up to
$\pm$0.2 {\AA}. This non-planar structure was confirmed by embedding the defect
into a 10$\times$8 supercell of graphene, resulting in 0.22 eV lower energy
than the previously considered planar structure. Natural bond orbital (NBO)
analysis showed sp$^3$ hybridization at the silicon atom for the non-planar

resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and corresponding spectrum

better overall spectrum match, but a small observed pre-peak is only present in
the corrugated simulation. Considering the small energy barrier between the two
equivalent corrugated conformations, both structures could plausibly exist as a

to the theory of random structures. For any given hypergraph ${\cal H}$ the
main questions is to determine the smallest bias $q({\cal H})$ that allows
Breaker to force that Maker ends up with an independent set of ${\cal H}$. Here
we prove matching general winning criteria for Maker and Breaker when the game
hypergraph satisfies a couple of natural `container-type' regularity conditions
about the degree of subsets of its vertices. This will enable us to derive a
hypergraph generalization of the $H$-building games, studied for graphs by
Bednarska and {\L}uczak. Furthermore, we investigate the biased version of
generalizations of the van der Waerden games introduced by Beck. We refer to
these generalizations as Rado games and determine their threshold bias up to
constant factors by applying our general criteria. We find it quite remarkable
that a purely game theoretic deterministic approach provides the right order of
magnitude for such a wide variety of hypergraphs, when the generalizations to
hypergraphs in the analogous setup of sparse random discrete structures are
usually quite challenging.

accelerated expansion of the universe, the energy conditions (ECs) are of
particular interest, since it is possible to confront and constrain the many
models, including different theories of gravity, with observational data. In
this context, we use the ECs to probe any alternative theory whose extra term
acts as a cosmological constant. For this purpose, we apply a model-independent
approach to reconstruct the recent expansion of the universe. Using Type Ia
supernova, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic-chronometer data, we perform
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to put constraints on the effective
cosmological constant $\Omega^0_{\rm eff}$. By imposing that the cosmological
constant is the only component that possibly violates the ECs, we derive lower
and upper bounds for its value. For instance, we obtain that $0.59 <
\Omega^0_{\rm eff} < 0.91$ and $0.40 < \Omega^0_{\rm eff} < 0.93$ within,
respectively, $1\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ confidence levels. In addition, about
30\% of the posterior distribution is incompatible with a cosmological
constant, showing that this method can potentially rule it out as a mechanism
for the accelerated expansion. We also study the consequence of these
constraints for two particular formulations of the bimetric massive gravity.
Namely, we consider the Visser's theory and the Hassan and Roses's massive
gravity by choosing a background metric such that both theories mimic General
Relativity with a cosmological constant. Using the $\Omega^0_{\rm eff}$
observational bounds along with the upper bounds on the graviton mass we obtain
constraints on the parameter spaces of both theories.

significantly from the Poisson baseline and demonstrate the existence of rich

critical end point of the nuclear liquid-gas first order phase transition. In
particular, $\kappa\sigma^2$ shows a non-monotonic energy dependence, and, in
contrast to the standard scenario for the QCD critical point, it does not
decrease at low collision energies. It is also found that the measurable net

has been extensively investigated using the techniques of inelastic neutron

structural complexity and flexibility, which leads to increased values of
thermal expansion coefficients approaching colossal values. In several
compounds, neutron inelastic scattering experiments have produced quantitative
estimates of the anharmonicity of phonons over a range of low energies, and
thereby explained the observed thermal expansion quantitatively. The
anharmonicity is found to be an order of magnitude larger than that in usual
materials. Lattice dynamical calculations have correctly predicted the observed
anharmonicity in the neutron experiments and revealed the overall nature of
phonons involved. In compounds showing negative thermal expansion, the phonons
responsible have rather low energies up to 10 meV. In most compounds, the
anharmonic phonons span all over the Brillouin zone, while in some cases the
specific phonons are limited to certain wave-vectors. The nature of specific
phonons responsible for anomalous behavior is found to be different in all
these compounds. These phonons generally involve transverse vibrations,
librations and internal distortions of the polyhedral units. The paper reviews
recent advances in the understanding of anomalous thermal expansion behaviour.

  and more numerical simulations",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In machine learning or statistics, it is often desirable to reduce the
dimensionality of a sample of data points in a high dimensional space
$\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper introduces a dimensionality reduction method where
the embedding coordinates are the eigenvectors of a positive semi-definite
kernel obtained as the solution of an infinite dimensional analogue of a
semi-definite program. This embedding is adaptive and non-linear. We discuss
this problem both with weak and strong smoothness assumptions about the learned
kernel. A main feature of our approach is the existence of an out-of-sample
extension formula of the embedding coordinates in both cases. This
extrapolation formula yields an extension of the kernel matrix to a
data-dependent Mercer kernel function. Our empirical results indicate that this
embedding method is more robust with respect to the influence of outliers,
compared with a spectral embedding method.

usually small, and it is challenging to suppress the bulk conductance and thus
to realize the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect. In this study, we find a novel

semi-metal bulk band structure with no full SOC-induced gap. Surprisingly, in
this two-dimensional system, we find the electron interactions open a Coulomb

and its two-parameter extension, fall in the class of exchangeable random
partitions, and have found wide applicability in model-based clustering,
population genetics, ecology or network analysis. While the exchangeability
assumption is sensible in many cases, it has some strong implications. In
particular, Kingman's representation theorem implies that the size of the
clusters necessarily grows linearly with the sample size; this feature may be
undesirable for some applications, as recently pointed out by Miller et al.
(2015). We present here a flexible class of non-exchangeable random partition
models which are able to generate partitions whose cluster sizes grow
sublinearly with the sample size, and where the growth rate is controlled by
one parameter. Along with this result, we provide the asymptotic behaviour of
the number of clusters of a given size, and show that the model can exhibit a
power-law behavior, controlled by another parameter. The construction is based
on completely random measures and a Poisson embedding of the random partition,
and inference is performed using a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm.
Additionally, we show how the model can also be directly used to generate
sparse multigraphs with power-law degree distributions and degree sequences
with sublinear growth. Finally, experiments on real datasets emphasize the
usefulness of the approach compared to a two-parameter Chinese restaurant
process.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implement translational equivariance by

the proper mapping. In this work, we develop Steerable Filter CNNs (SFCNNs)
which achieve joint equivariance under translations and rotations by design.
The proposed architecture employs steerable filters to efficiently compute
orientation dependent responses for many orientations without suffering
interpolation artifacts from filter rotation. We utilize group convolutions
which guarantee an equivariant mapping. In addition, we generalize He's weight
initialization scheme to filters which are defined as a linear combination of a
system of atomic filters. Numerical experiments show a substantial enhancement
of the sample complexity with a growing number of sampled filter orientations
and confirm that the network generalizes learned patterns over orientations.

potential choices, including the power-law and the exponential ones, we show
that mimetic gravity can be brought into good agreement with the observed
behavior of the universe. Moreover, with an inverse square potential we find
that mimetic gravity offers an appealing unified cosmological scenario where
both dark energy and dark matter are characterized by a single scalar field,
and where the cosmic coincidence problem is alleviated.

analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). In the second step, we test the
relationship between the dimensions and quality of papers (as measured by the
post-publication peer-review system of F1000Prime assessments) - using
regression analysis. The results of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate
along different dimensions, whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation
counts, and tweets form a separate dimension. The results of the regression
analysis indicate that citation-based metrics and readership counts are
significantly more related to quality, than tweets. This result on the one hand
questions the use of Twitter counts for research evaluation purposes and on the
other hand indicates potential use of Mendeley reader counts.

two collections of sets, with respect to a threshold and a similarity function
such as overlap, Jaccard, dice or cosine. The naive approach verifies all pairs
of sets and it is often considered impractical due the high number of
combinations. So, Exact Set Similarity Join algorithms are usually based on the
Filter-Verification Framework, that applies a series of filters to reduce the
number of verified pairs. This paper presents a new filtering technique called
Bitmap Filter, which is able to accelerate state-of-the-art algorithms for the
exact Set Similarity Join problem. The Bitmap Filter uses hash functions to
create bitmaps of fixed b bits, representing characteristics of the sets. Then,
it applies bitwise operations (such as xor and population count) on the bitmaps
in order to infer a similarity upper bound for each pair of sets. If the upper
bound is below a given similarity threshold, the pair of sets is pruned. The
Bitmap Filter benefits from the fact that bitwise operations are efficiently
implemented by many modern general-purpose processors and it was easily applied
to four state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in CPU: AllPairs, PPJoin,
AdaptJoin and GroupJoin. Furthermore, we propose a Graphic Processor Unit (GPU)
algorithm based on the naive approach but using the Bitmap Filter to speedup
the computation. The experiments considered 9 collections containing from 100
thousands up to 10 million sets and the joins were made using Jaccard
thresholds from 0.50 to 0.95. The Bitmap Filter was able to improve 90% of the
experiments in CPU, with speedups of up to 4.50x and 1.43x on average. Using
the GPU algorithm, the experiments were able to speedup the original CPU
algorithms by up to 577x using an Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 Ti.

morphology and how clear or indistinct it is, (b) whether the mass map and
synthetic lensed image appear to be plausible, and (c) how the lens-model mass
compares with the stellar mass and the abundance-matched halo mass. The lensing
masses range from ~10^11 Msun to >10^13 Msun. Preliminary estimates of the
stellar masses show a smaller spread in stellar mass (except for two lenses): a
factor of a few below or above ~10^11 Msun. Therefore, we expect the
stellar-to-total mass fraction to decline sharply as lensing mass increases.
The most massive system with a convincing model is J1434+522 (SW05). The two
low-mass outliers are J0206-095 (SW19) and J2217+015 (SW42); if these two are

optimization. Using a dynamical model of the vehicle, control inputs are
computed by receding horizon based controllers, where the objective is to
maximize progress on the track subject to the requirement of staying on the

The first controller employs a two-level structure, consisting of a path
planner and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for tracking. The
second controller combines both tasks in one nonlinear optimization problem
(NLP) following the ideas of contouring control. Linear time varying models
obtained by linearization are used to build local approximations of the control
NLPs in the form of convex quadratic programs (QPs) at each sampling time. The
resulting QPs have a typical MPC structure and can be solved in the range of
milliseconds by recent structure exploiting solvers, which is key to the
real-time feasibility of the overall control scheme. Obstacle avoidance is
incorporated by means of a high-level corridor planner based on dynamic
programming, which generates convex constraints for the controllers according
to the current position of opponents and the track layout. The control
performance is investigated experimentally using 1:43 scale RC race cars,
driven at speeds of more than 3 m/s and in operating regions with saturated
rear tire forces (drifting). The algorithms run at 50 Hz sampling rate on
embedded computing platforms, demonstrating the real-time feasibility and high

without any training data. Recently, structure-transfer based methods are
proposed to implement ZSL by transferring structural knowledge from the
semantic embedding space to image feature space to classify testing images.
However, we observe that such a knowledge transfer framework may suffer from
the problem of the geometric inconsistency between the data in the training and
testing spaces. We call this problem as the space shift problem. In this paper,
we propose a novel graph based method to alleviate this space shift problem.
Specifically, a Shared Reconstruction Graph (SRG) is pursued to capture the
common structure of data in the two spaces. With the learned SRG, each unseen
class prototype (cluster center) in the image feature space can be synthesized
by the linear combination of other class prototypes, so that testing instances
can be classified based on the distance to these synthesized prototypes. The
SRG bridges the image feature space and semantic embedding space. By applying
spectral clustering on the learned SRG, many meaningful clusters can be
discovered, which interprets ZSL performance on the datasets. Our method can be
easily extended to the generalized zero-shot learning setting. Experiments on
three popular datasets show that our method outperforms other methods on all
datasets. Even with a small number of training samples, our method can achieve
the state-of-the-art performance.

non-linear diffusion equation using mixing length theory to quantify heat
transport by both convection and mixing of the melt and solid phases. In this
formulation the effective or eddy diffusivity depends on the entropy gradient,
$\partial S/\partial r$, as well as entropy. First we present a simplified
model with semi-analytical solutions, highlighting the large dynamic range of
$\partial S/\partial r$, around 12 orders of magnitude, for physically-relevant
parameters. It also elucidates the thermal structure of a magma ocean during
the earliest stage of crystal formation. This motivates the development of a
simple, stable numerical scheme able to capture the large dynamic range of
$\partial S/\partial r$ and provide a flexible and robust method for
time-integrating the energy equation.
  We then consider a full model including energy fluxes associated with
convection, mixing, gravitational separation, and conduction that all depend on
the thermophysical properties of the melt and solid phases. This model is
discretised and evolved by applying the finite volume method (FVM), allowing
for extended precision calculations and using $\partial S/\partial r$ as the
solution variable. The FVM is well-suited to this problem since it is naturally
energy conserving, flexible, and intuitive to incorporate arbitrary non-linear
fluxes that rely on lookup data. Special attention is given to the numerically
challenging scenario in which crystals first form in the centre of a magma
ocean.
  Our computational framework is immediately applicable to modelling high melt

This problem is then solved using an iterative method. However, in each step of
the iteration the computation of the functional value involves a finite

recent years. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been
proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performances on detecting steganography.
In this paper, we explore an important technique in deep learning, the batch
normalization, for the task of image steganalysis. Different from natural image
classification, steganalysis is to discriminate cover images and stego images
which are the result of adding weak stego signals into covers. This
characteristic makes a cover image is more statistically similar to its stego
than other cover images, requiring steganalytic methods to use paired learning
to extract effective features for image steganalysis. Our theoretical analysis
shows that a CNN model with multiple normalization layers is hard to be
generalized to new data in the test set when it is well trained with paired
learning. To hand this difficulty, we propose a novel normalization technique
called Shared Normalization (SN) in this paper. Unlike the batch normalization
layer utilizing the mini-batch mean and standard deviation to normalize each
input batch, SN shares same statistics for all training and test batches. Based
on the proposed SN layer, we further propose a novel neural network model for
image steganalysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network
with SN layers is stable and can detect the state of the art steganography with
better performances than previous methods.

mass spectrum of $J/\psi K$ to demonstrate that nontrivial lineshapes can arise
from such a mechanism. This process, which goes through triangle loop
transitions, is located in the vicinity of the so-called ""triangle singularity
(TS)"" kinematics. As a result, it provides a special mechanism for the
production of exotic states $Z_{cs}$, which is the strange partner of
$Z_c(3900)$, but with flavor contents of $c\bar{c}q\bar{s}$ (or
$c\bar{c}s\bar{q}$) with $q$ denoting $u/d$ quarks. The lineshapes of the
$e^+e^-\to J/\psi K\bar{K}$ cross sections and $J/\psi K \ (J/\psi \bar{K})$

that a pole structure can be easily distinguished from open threshold CUSP
effects if an exotic state is created. A precise measurement of the cross
section lineshapes can test such a mixing mechanism and provide navel
information for the exotic partners of the $Z_c(3900)$ in the charmonium

self-interested agents. They offer a number of solution concepts describing how
the outcome of the cooperation should be shared among the players.
Unfortunately, computational problems associated with many of these solution
concepts tend to be intractable---NP-hard or worse. In this paper, we
incorporate complexity measures recently proposed by Feige and Izsak (2013),
called dependency degree and supermodular degree, into the complexity analysis
of cooperative games. We show that many computational problems for cooperative
games become tractable for games whose dependency degree or supermodular degree
are bounded. In particular, we prove that simple games admit efficient
algorithms for various solution concepts when the supermodular degree is small;
further, we show that computing the Shapley value is always in FPT with respect
to the dependency degree. Finally, we note that, while determining the
dependency among players is computationally hard, there are efficient
algorithms for special classes of games.

The gas streaming into the halo compresses and heats the massive filamentary
cloud to a temperature of $\sim\!10,000\,$Kelvin. The gas cloud cools rapidly
by atomic hydrogen cooling, and then by molecular hydrogen cooling down to
$\sim\!400\,$Kelvin. The rapid decrease of the temperature and hence of the
Jeans mass triggers fragmentation of the filament to yield multiple gas clumps

stellar masses are in the range of $\sim\!50$-$120\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The massive
stars gravitationally attract each other and form a compact star cluster. We
follow the dynamics of the star cluster using a hybrid $N$-body simulation. We
show that massive star binaries are formed in a few million years through

paper, we present a novel network structure called Cascaded Pyramid Network
(CPN) which targets to relieve the problem from these ""hard"" keypoints. More
specifically, our algorithm includes two stages: GlobalNet and RefineNet.
GlobalNet is a feature pyramid network which can successfully localize the
""simple"" keypoints like eyes and hands but may fail to precisely recognize the
occluded or invisible keypoints. Our RefineNet tries explicitly handling the
""hard"" keypoints by integrating all levels of feature representations from the
GlobalNet together with an online hard keypoint mining loss. In general, to
address the multi-person pose estimation problem, a top-down pipeline is
adopted to first generate a set of human bounding boxes based on a detector,
followed by our CPN for keypoint localization in each human bounding box. Based

problems affect their proof complexity. We show that, for the most studied
propositional, algebraic, and semi-algebraic proof systems, the classical
constructions of pp-interpretability, homomorphic equivalence and addition of
constants to a core preserve the proof complexity of the CSP. As a result, for
those proof systems, the classes of constraint languages for which small
unsatisfiability certificates exist can be characterised algebraically. We
illustrate our results by a gap theorem saying that a constraint language
either has resolution refutations of constant width, or does not have
bounded-depth Frege refutations of subexponential size. The former holds
exactly for the widely studied class of constraint languages of bounded width.
This class is also known to coincide with the class of languages with
refutations of sublinear degree in Sums-of-Squares and Polynomial Calculus over
the real-field, for which we provide alternative proofs. We then ask for the
existence of a natural proof system with good behaviour with respect to
reductions and simultaneously small size refutations beyond bounded width. We
give an example of such a proof system by showing that bounded-degree
Lov\'asz-Schrijver satisfies both requirements. Finally, building on the known
lower bounds, we demonstrate the applicability of the method of reducibilities

In total we observe five phonon modes and a phonon cutoff energy of about 40
meV. We identify the origin of each phonon mode based on the selection rules of
HREELS and by comparing the experimental results to the ones of \emph{ab
initio} density functional calculations. The most prominent phonon modes
$A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $A_{2u}$ appear at energies of about $20.5$ and $25.6$

changing the momentum from zero up to the zone boundary, indicating that they
are mainly of optical nature. A comparison between our results and the results
of \emph{ab initio} calculations indicates that there must be a mutual
interplay between magnetism and lattice dynamics in this compound, similar to
the other Fe-based superconductors. Finally, we comment on the role of
temperature on the phonon modes probed at the $\bar{\Gamma}$--point. It is
observed that both the $B_{1g}$ and $A_{2u}$ phonon modes undergo a downward
shift while increasing the temperature from 15 to 300 K. In the case of the
$A_{2u}$ mode this shift is about 1.5 meV.

For instance,
a helicopter flying over terrain encounters a very different arrangement of
obstacles than a robotic arm manipulating objects on a cluttered table top.
State-of-the-art motion planning systems do not exploit this structure, thereby
expending valuable planning effort searching for implausible solutions. We are
interested in planning algorithms that actively infer the underlying structure
of the valid configuration space during planning in order to find solutions
with minimal effort. Consider the problem of evaluating edges on a graph to
quickly discover collision-free paths. Evaluating edges is expensive, both for
robots with complex geometries like robot arms, and for robots with limited
onboard computation like UAVs. Until now, this challenge has been addressed via
laziness i.e. deferring edge evaluation until absolutely necessary, with the
hope that edges turn out to be valid. However, all edges are not alike in value
- some have a lot of potentially good paths flowing through them, and some
others encode the likelihood of neighbouring edges being valid. This leads to
our key insight - instead of passive laziness, we can actively choose edges
that reduce the uncertainty about the validity of paths. We show that this is
equivalent to the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region
determination (DRD). However, the DRD problem is not only combinatorially hard,
but also requires explicit enumeration of all possible worlds. We propose a
novel framework that combines two DRD algorithms, DIRECT and BISECT, to
overcome both issues. We show that our approach outperforms several
state-of-the-art algorithms on a spectrum of planning problems for mobile

attention due to their fascinating properties and promising applications.
Although the ferroelectric (FE)-ferroelastic and ferromagnetic
(FM)-ferroelastic multiferroics have been observed/predicted in 2D systems, 2D
ferromagnetic-ferroelectric (FM-FE) multiferroics remain to be discovered since
FM insulators are very rare. Here, we proposed for the first time the concept
of 2D hyperferroelectric metals, with which the insulating prerequisite for the
FM-FE multiferroic is no longer required in 2D systems. We validate the concept
of 2D hyperferroelectric metals and 2D metallic FM-FE multiferroics by
performing first-principle calculations on 2D CrN and CrB2 systems. The 2D
buckled monolayer CrN is found to be a hyperferroelectic metal with the FM
ground state, i.e., a 2D FM-FE multiferroic. With the global optimization
approach, we find the 2D CrB2 system has an antiferromagnetic (AFM)/planar
ground state and a FM/FE metastable state, suggesting that it can be used to
realize electric field control of magnetism. Our analysis demonstrates that the
spin-phonon coupling and metal-metal interaction are two new mechanisms for
stabilizing the out-of-plane electric polarization in 2D systems. Our work not
only extends the concept of FE to metallic systems, but also paves a new way to
search the long-sought high temperature FM-FE multiferroics.

academic interest and an increase in start-up businesses in the past decade. MD
has expanded into a niche of small scale thermal desalination using solar and

acceptable efficiency. Recent studies indicate that MD could attain the
efficiencies of state-of-the-art mature thermal desalination technologies,

  The aim of this research is to better understand and provide solutions for
two major challenge areas for MD: efficiency and membrane fouling. Studies on
improving MD efficiency included examining the effects of tilt angle on MD
performance using numerical simulations paired with experiments, devising a
novel MD system design for with superhydrophobic surfaces to improved
efficiencies, and an entropy-generation comparison of MD to other desalination
technologies. For fouling studies in MD, a review of MD fouling was undertaken
to synthesize conclusions from the literature and to explore gaps in the
literature. This review lead to studies of the effect of filtration and bulk

exhaustive derivation of all tree-level terms of the non-Gaussian covariance of
the galaxy $C_\ell$, with the computation developed up to the third order in
perturbation theory and local halo bias, including the non-local tidal tensor
effect. A diagrammatic method was used to derive the involved galaxy 3D
trispectra, including shot-noise contributions. The projection to the angular
covariance was derived in all trispectra cases with and without Limber's
approximation, with the formulae being of potential interest for other
observables than galaxies. The effect of subtracting shot-noise from the
measured spectrum is also discussed, and does simplify the covariance, though
some non-Gaussian shot-noise terms still remain. I make the link between this
complete derivation and partial terms which have been used previously in the

additional terms which were not previously considered, including a whole new
class which I dub braiding terms as it contains multipole-mixing kernels. The

leads to inelastic backscattering which makes the transport diffusive. Using a
semiclassical Boltzmann equation we compute the electrical conductivity and
show that it exhibits a metallic Bloch-Gr\""uneisen law. At temperatures on the

thus lowers the conductivity of the edge state drastically. Transport remains
ballistic only for short enough edges, and in this case the correction to the
quantized conductance vanishes as $\delta G \propto T^5$ at low temperatures.
Relying only on parallel transport of the helical spin texture along the

includes as special and limiting cases the normal, gamma and Laplace
distributions. Some of the numerous applications include financial modelling
and approximation on Wiener space. Recently, Stein's method has been extended
to the VG distribution. However, technical difficulties have meant that bounds
for distributional approximations have only been given for smooth test
functions (typically requiring at least two derivatives for the test function).
In this paper, which deals with symmetric variance-gamma (SVG) distributions,
and a companion paper \cite{gaunt vgii}, which deals with the whole family of
VG distributions, we address this issue. In this paper, we obtain new bounds
for the derivatives of the solution of the SVG Stein equation, which allow for
approximations to be made in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein metrics, and also
introduce a distributional transformation that is natural in the context of SVG
approximation. We apply this theory to obtain Wasserstein or Kolmogorov error
bounds for SVG approximation in four settings: comparison of VG and SVG
distributions, SVG approximation of functionals of isonormal Gaussian
processes, SVG approximation of a statistic for binary sequence comparison, and
Laplace approximation of a random sum of independent mean zero random
variables.

electron impact dissociation of H2O. Following delivery of the lander, Philae,
on 2014 November 12, the trajectory of Rosetta shifted to near-terminator
orbits that allowed for these emissions to be observed against the shadowed

identify unique spectral signatures of dissociative electron impact excitation
of H2O, CO2, and O2. CO emissions were found to be due to both electron and
photoexcitation processes. Thus we are able, from far-ultraviolet spectroscopy,
to qualitatively study the evolution of the primary molecular constituents of
the gaseous coma from start to finish of the escort phase. Our results show
asymmetric outgassing of H2O and CO2 about perihelion, H2O dominant before and

increase evolvability. Here, we report on a previously unknown phenomenon when
embodied agents are allowed to develop and evolve: Evolution discovers body
plans robust to control changes, these body plans become genetically
assimilated, yet controllers for these agents are not assimilated. This allows
evolution to continue climbing fitness gradients by tinkering with the
developmental programs for controllers within these permissive body plans. This
exposes a previously unknown detail about the Baldwin effect: instead of all
useful traits becoming genetically assimilated, only traits that render the
agent robust to changes in other traits become assimilated. We refer to this as
differential canalization. This finding also has implications for the
evolutionary design of artificial and embodied agents such as robots: robots
robust to internal changes in their controllers may also be robust to external
changes in their environment, such as transferal from simulation to reality or

not handle dissipation. Therefore, a resistive pulsar magnetic field model is
needed. To break the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) condition $E \cdot B = 0$,
Ohm's law is used. In this work, I introduce resistivity depending upon the
distance from the star and obtain a self-consistent steady state by time
integration. Poloidal current circuits form in the magnetosphere while the
toroidal magnetic-field region expands beyond the light cylinder and the
Poynting flux radiation appears. High electric resistivity causes a large space
scale poloidal current circuit and the magnetosphere radiates a larger Poynting
flux than the linear increase outside of the light cylinder radius. The formed
poloidal current circuit has width, which grows with the electric conductivity.
This result contributes to a more concrete dissipative pulsar magnetosphere
model.

static-analysis based system that abstracts the API calls performed by an app
to their class, package, or family, and builds a model from their sequences
obtained from the call graph of an app as Markov chains. This ensures that the
model is more resilient to API changes and the features set is of manageable
size. We evaluate MaMaDroid using a dataset of 8.5K benign and 35.5K malicious
apps collected over a period of six years, showing that it effectively detects
malware (with up to 0.99 F-measure) and keeps its detection capabilities for
long periods of time (up to 0.87 F-measure two years after training). We also
show that MaMaDroid remarkably outperforms DroidAPIMiner, a state-of-the-art

assess whether MaMaDroid's effectiveness mainly stems from the API abstraction
or from the sequencing modeling, we also evaluate a variant of it that uses

this duality provides a concrete instance of the large $N$ gauge/string

In this work, we learn reusable options whose parameters can vary, encouraging
different behaviors, based on the current situation. In principle, these
behaviors can include vigor, defence or even risk-averseness. These are some
examples of what we refer to in the broader context as Situational Awareness

and learning situationally aware options in a Probabilistic Goal Semi-Markov
Decision Process (PG-SMDP). This is achieved using our Situationally Aware
oPtions (SAP) policy gradient algorithm which comes with a theoretical
convergence guarantee. We learn reusable options in different scenarios in a
RoboCup soccer domain (i.e., winning/losing). These options learn to execute
with different levels of vigor resulting in human-like behaviours such as
`time-wasting' in the winning scenario. We show the potential of the agent to
exit bad local optima using reusable options in RoboCup. Finally, using SAP,
the agent mitigates feature-based model misspecification in a Bottomless Pit of

robust demand prediction methods for weather sensitive products at retail

are often exposed to extreme weather events which can have a huge impact on
sales regarding the affected stores and products. We want to accurately predict
the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products around the time of

level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and
after that storm. While they rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales

lacks a systematic measure of effectiveness. We employ all the methods critical

extracted from the raw historical dataset for demand forecasting accuracy and

parallelization algorithms. The framework of this work is the Semi-Lagrangian
setting for solving the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation and the Gyseka code. In
this paper, a new variant for the interpolation method is proposed that can
handle the mesh singularity in the poloidal plane at r=0 (polar system is used
for the moment in Gysela). A non-uniform meshing of the poloidal plane is
proposed instead of uniform one in order to save memory and computations. The
interpolation method, the gyroaverage operator, and the Poisson solver are
revised in order to cope with non-uniform meshes. A mapping that establish a
bijection from polar coordinates to more realistic plasma shape is used to
improve realism. Convergence studies are provided to establish the validity and
robustness of our new approach.

circuits. Here, we designed, fabricated and characterized a nanophotonic all
optical modulator (NOM) in silicon that is an order of magnitude smaller than
any previous silicon modulators, and exhibits an extinction ratio and operable
spectrum that are an order of magnitude larger than alternatives. Simulations
indicate that our device can provide about 9.5dB extinction ratio with a
bandwidth of 10nm, centered at 1.55um, corresponding to extinction ratio per
device length of about 3.2dB/{\mu}m. Our device is fully compatible with
standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes.
The device is an example of a photonic device designed using multi-state
topological optimization and will lead to a new class of ultra-compact and
multi-functional active integrated-silicon devices.

challenging open problems in modern science. The very term complexity is very
elusive, so that the main goal of this theory is to find meaningful quantifiers
for it. In fact we need various measures to take into account the multiple
facets of this term. Here some biparametric Cr\'amer-Rao and Heisenberg-R\'enyi
measures of complexity of continuous probability distributions are defined and
discussed. Then, they are applied to the blackbody radiation at temperature T
in a d-dimensional universe. It is found that these dimensionless quantities do
not depend on T nor on any physical constants. So, they have an universal
character in the sense that they only depend on the spatial dimensionality. To
determine these complexity quantifiers we have calculated their dispersion
(typical deviations) and entropy (R\'enyi entropies and the generalized Fisher
information) constituents. They are found to have a temperature-dependent
behavior similar to the celebrated Wien's displacement law of the dominant
frequency $\nu_{max}$ at which the spectrum reaches its maximum. Moreover, they
allow us to gain insights into new aspects of the d-dimensional blackbody
spectrum and about the quantification of quantum effects associated with space
dimensionality.

fractional integral operators $I_\gamma$ on these new function spaces.
Furthermore, the weighted strong-type estimate and endpoint estimate of linear
commutators $[b,I_{\gamma}]$ generated by $b$ and $I_{\gamma}$ are established
as well. In addition, we are going to study related problems about two-weight,
weak type inequalities for $I_{\gamma}$ and $[b,I_{\gamma}]$ on the weighted
amalgam spaces and give some results. Based on these results and pointwise
domination, we can prove norm inequalities involving fractional maximal
operator $M_{\gamma}$ and generalized fractional integrals $\mathcal
L^{-\gamma/2}$ in the context of weighted amalgam spaces, where $0<\gamma<n$
and $\mathcal L$ is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup on
$L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ with Gaussian kernel bounds.

classification. Since CNN feed forward propagation involves highly regular
parallel computation, it benefits from a significant speed-up when running on
fine grain parallel programmable logic devices. As a consequence, several
studies have proposed FPGA-based accelerators for CNNs. However, because of the
large computationalpower required by CNNs, none of the previous studies has
proposed a direct mapping of the CNN onto the physical resources of an FPGA,
allocating each processing actor to its own hardware instance.In this paper, we
demonstrate the feasibility of the so called direct hardware mapping (DHM) and
discuss several tactics we explore to make DHM usable in practice. As a proof
of concept, we introduce the HADDOC2 open source tool, that automatically
transforms a CNN description into a synthesizable hardware description with
platform-independent direct hardware mapping.
