Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where conduction and valence bands touch at points in
reciprocal (k)-space, and the Dirac nodal-line semimetals, where these bands
touch along a line or a loop in k-space. However, the coexistence of multiple
fermion phases in one and the same material has not been verified yet. Using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles
electronic structure calculations, we systematically study the metallic
topological quantum material, Hf2Te2P. Our investigations discover various
properties that are rare and never observed in a single Dirac material. We
observe the coexistence of both weak and strong topological surface states in
the same material and interestingly, at the same momentum position. An
one-dimensional Dirac crossing{the Dirac-node arc-along a high-symmetry
direction is revealed by our first-principles calculations and confirmed by our
ARPES measurements. This novel state is associated with the surface bands of a
weak topological insulator protected by in-plane time-reversal invariance.
Ternary compound Hf2Te2P thus emerges as an intriguing platform to study the
coexistence and competition of multi-fermionic states in one material.

spins aligned along a large transverse field and ramp down the field across the
critical point following various protocols. We measure the spin observables,
both experimentally and in our simulations to characterize the state of the
system at the end of the ramp. We find that under current operating conditions
an optimally designed ramp is not sufficient to achieve significant fidelity
with the superradiant ground state. However, our theoretical investigation
shows that slight modifications of experimental parameters, together with
modest reductions in decoherence rates and thermal noise can increase the

A three-level model with realistic molecular dissipation is employed to analyze
the performance as function of the pump field amplitude and number of
molecules. Few molecules and moderate pumping produce a single narrow emission
peak because the excited molecules transfer energy to a single dipole plasmon
mode by amplified spontaneous emission. Under strong pumping, the single peak
splits into broader and weaker emission peaks because two molecular excited
levels interfere with each other through coherent coupling with the pump field
and with the dipole plasmon field. A large number of molecules gives rise to a
Poisson-like distribution of plasmon number states with a large mean number
characteristic of lasing action. These characteristics of lasing, however,
deteriorate under strong pumping because of the molecular interference effect.

and technological applications. A novel strategy is proposed to validate the
reliability of the 3D structures of aptamers, produced in silico by using free
software. The procedure consists of three steps: a. the production of a large
set of conformations for each candidate aptamer, b. the rigid docking upon the
receptor, c. the topological and electrical characterization of the products.
Steps a. and b. allow a global binding score of the ligand-receptor complexes
based on the distribution of the ""effective affinity"", i.e. the sum of the
conformational and the docking energy. Step c. employs a complex network
approach (Proteotronics) to characterize the electrical properties of the
aptamers and the ligand-receptor complexes. The test-bed is represented by a
group of anti- Angiopoietin-2 aptamers. In a previous literature these aptamers
were processed both in vitro and in silico, by using an approach different from
that here presented, and finally tested with a SPS experiment. Computational
expectations and experimental outcomes did not agree, while our results show a
good agreement with the known measurements. The devised procedure is not
aptamer-specific and, integrating structure production with structure
selection, candidates itself as a quite complete theoretical approach for
aptamer selection.

  2017), Published at CVPR 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the existing deep learning-based methods for 3D hand and human pose
estimation from a single depth map are based on a common framework that takes a
2D depth map and directly regresses the 3D coordinates of keypoints, such as
hand or human body joints, via 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The
first weakness of this approach is the presence of perspective distortion in
the 2D depth map. While the depth map is intrinsically 3D data, many previous
methods treat depth maps as 2D images that can distort the shape of the actual
object through projection from 3D to 2D space. This compels the network to
perform perspective distortion-invariant estimation. The second weakness of the
conventional approach is that directly regressing 3D coordinates from a 2D
image is a highly non-linear mapping, which causes difficulty in the learning
procedure. To overcome these weaknesses, we firstly cast the 3D hand and human
pose estimation problem from a single depth map into a voxel-to-voxel
prediction that uses a 3D voxelized grid and estimates the per-voxel likelihood
for each keypoint. We design our model as a 3D CNN that provides accurate
estimates while running in real-time. Our system outperforms previous methods
in almost all publicly available 3D hand and human pose estimation datasets and
placed first in the HANDS 2017 frame-based 3D hand pose estimation challenge.

(YBCO) to address several issues therein by using the temperature derivative of
in-plane resistivity, d\{rho}ab/dT. For p less than about 0.15, a temperature
Tf has been defined to mark the onset of an upturn in d\{rho}ab/dT at T>Tc,
which, in light of prior studies on another cuprate La2-xSrxCuO4, is attributed
to the onset of superconducting fluctuations in normal state. The Tf exhibits a
doping dependence similar to Tc, and the interval between Tf and Tc is about
5-30 K across the underdoped regime, showing agreement with a variety of other
measurements to probe a restricted temperature range of superconducting
fluctuations. Above Tf, the d\{rho}ab/dT increases linearly as T increases up
to a value denoted as T2, which is about half the T* and falls roughly in
parallel with T* as p rises up to about 0.13, indicating a prominent
T^2-dependent \{rho}ab in this T-p region. The d\{rho}ab/dT helps reveal that,
at Tf<T<T2, the \{rho}ab also involves an insulating-like component for p<0.08,
or a T-linear component for p>0.10-0.11, thereby leaving a narrow window of
doping for \{rho}ab to show a pure T^2 dependence. As T increases further, the
d\{rho}ab/dT reaches a local maximum at a temperature T_R, signifying the known
curvature change (inflection point) in \{rho}ab. With the derivatives, it is
illustrated that, in the vicinity of T_R, the in-plane Hall coefficient R_H and
thermopower Sab of YBCO display curvature changes as well, suggesting a
correlation of the three transport properties. It is also found that the
dSab/dT shows the onset of an upturn at a temperature coinciding with the Tf,
which, backing the identification of Tf with the onset of superconducting
fluctuations, demonstrates further the virtue of using the temperature
derivative to unveil information helpful for the study of high-Tc cuprates.

nanotechnology. How to accurately predict the motion of a crystal surface is of
fundamental importance. Many continuum models have been developed for this
purpose, including a number of PDE models, which are often obtained as the
continuum limit of a family of kinetic Monte Carlo models of crystal surface
relaxation that includes both the solid-on-solid and discrete Gaussian models.
In this paper we offer an analytical perspective into some of these models. To
be specific, we study the existence of a weak solution to the boundary value
problem for the equation $ - \Delta e^{-\mbox{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla
u\right)}+au=f$, where $p>1, a>0$ are given numbers and $f$ is a given
function. This problem is derived from a crystal surface model proposed by
J.L.~Marzuola and J.~Weare (2013 Physical Review, E 88, 032403). The
mathematical challenge is due to the fact that the principal term in our
equation is an exponential function of a p-Laplacian. Existence of a
suitably-defined weak solution is established under the assumptions that
$p\in(1,2], \ N\leq 4$, and $f\in W^{1,p}$. Our investigations reveal that the
key to our existence assertion is how to control the set where
$-\mbox{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\right)$ is $\pm\infty$.

finite volume method. The results depict that the enhance of nano-particles
volume concentration and Reynolds number have dramatic effects on heat transfer
coefficient enhancement. Moreover, the increase of nano-particle diameter has
opposite impact on heat transfer efficiency. The passive way leads to higher
pressure drops. For all fluids under consideration, pressure drop escalated
with Reynolds number. Injecting nano-particles into the water causes to
increase in pressure drop and this impact is more significant in high
nano-particle volume fraction.

solitons. The first type corresponds to gauged Skyrmions living within a finite

$U(1)$ gauged Skyrme model whose periodic time-dependence is protected by a
winding number). The notion of electromagnetic duality can be extended for
these two types of configurations in the sense that the electric and one of the
magnetic components can be interchanged. These analytic solutions show very
explicitly the Callan-Witten mechanism (according to which magnetic monopoles
may ""swallow"" part of the topological charge of the Skyrmion) since the
electromagnetic field contribute directly to the conserved topological charge
of the gauged Skyrmions. As it happens in superconductors, the magnetic field
is suppressed in the core of the gauged Skyrmions. On the other hand, the
electric field is strongly suppresed in the core of gauged time crystals.

disentangled factors of variation without exploiting any manual labeling or

of feature chunks, each chunk representing a factor of variation. It supports
applications such as transferring attributes from one image to another, by
simply mixing and unmixing feature chunks, and classification or retrieval
based on one or several attributes, by considering a user-specified subset of
feature chunks. We learn our representation without any labeling or knowledge
of the data domain, using an autoencoder architecture with two novel training
objectives: first, we propose an invariance objective to encourage that
encoding of each attribute, and decoding of each chunk, are invariant to
changes in other attributes and chunks, respectively; second, we include a
classification objective, which ensures that each chunk corresponds to a
consistently discernible attribute in the represented image, hence avoiding
degenerate feature mappings where some chunks are completely ignored. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the MNIST, Sprites, and CelebA
datasets.

desirable that rescaling the model parameters leads to rescaled distances

leads to complex, anisotropic patterns. We study the resulting stationary

repositioning, and an X-ray ""lucky imaging"" technique, Chandra imaging suggests
an upper limit of about 0.3 arc seconds on the size of the Fe K-alpha emission
region, corresponding to 98 pc. Both spectroscopy and direct imaging now point
to an emission region consistent with an extended molecular torus or disk,
potentially available to fuel the black hole. A low X-ray continuum flux was
likely measured from NGC 1275; contemporaneously, radio flaring and record-high
GeV fluxes were measured. This may be an example of the correlation between
X-ray flux dips and jet activity that is observed in other classes of accreting
black holes across the mass scale.

The radiation monitor made in situ measurements of the cosmic ray flux while
also providing information about its energy spectrum. We describe the monitor
and present measurements which show a gradual 40% increase in count rate
coinciding with the declining phase of the solar cycle. Modulations of up to
10% were also observed with periods of 13 and 26 days that are associated with
co-rotating interaction regions and heliospheric current sheet crossings. These
variations in the flux above the monitor detection threshold (approximately 70

of this interaction, this research analyzes short-range interactions of an edge
dislocation with an array of equally-spaced identical precipitates. We use a
modified dislocation dynamics approach accounting for penetrable and
impenetrable precipitates. This research quantifies the effects of precipitate
resistance on the geometry of the dislocation-precipitation interaction and the
local distribution of plastic strain near a precipitate. The results show that
a precipitate with a higher resistance causes an increase in the maximum value
of dislocation curvature during the bypass. In addition, a higher level of
precipitate resistance leads to a lower level of plastic deformation. Moreover,
we observed a high plastic strain gradient at the interface of non-shearable
precipitates.

information streams. We first introduce a coarse-to-fine network which extracts
shared deep features at different action class granularities and progressively
integrates them to obtain a more accurate feature representation for input
actions. We further introduce an asynchronous fusion network. It fuses
information from different streams by asynchronously integrating stream-wise
features at different time points, hence better leveraging the complementary
information in different streams. Experimental results on action recognition
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance.

into an equilibrium state exhibiting vertical shear. This state may be subject
to a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical shear instability' (VSI), whose
breakdown into turbulence transports a moderate amount of angular momentum
while also facilitating planet formation, possibly via the production of
small-scale vortices. In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit
arbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the
incompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are
themselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk
rotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain
large amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in
saturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global
simulations. More generally, the parasites may set the amplitude of VSI
turbulence in strongly irradiated disks. They are also important in breaking
the axisymmetry of the flow, via the unavoidable formation of vortices. The
vortices, however, are not aligned with the orbital plane and thus express a
pronounced $z$-dependence. We also briefly demonstrate that the vertical shear
has little effect on the magnetorotational instability, whereas magnetic fields
easily quench the VSI, a potential issue in the ionised surface regions of the
disk and also at larger radii.

for clustering. It localizes the centroids of data clusters via estimating
modes of the probability distribution that generates the data points, using the
`optimal' Epanechnikov kernel density estimator. However, since the procedure
involves non-smooth kernel density functions, the convergence behavior of
Epanechnikov mean shift lacks theoretical support as of this writing---most of
the existing analyses are based on smooth functions and thus cannot be applied
to Epanechnikov Mean Shift. In this work, we first show that the original
Epanechnikov Mean Shift may indeed terminate at a non-critical point, due to
the non-smoothness nature. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple remedy to
fix it. The modified Epanechnikov Mean Shift is guaranteed to terminate at a
local maximum of the estimated density, which corresponds to a cluster
centroid, within a finite number of iterations. We also propose a way to avoid
running the Mean Shift iterates from every data point, while maintaining good
clustering accuracies under non-overlapping spherical Gaussian mixture models.
This further pushes Epanechnikov Mean Shift to handle very large and
high-dimensional data sets. Experiments show surprisingly good performance
compared to the Lloyd's K-means algorithm and the EM algorithm.

interest for their use in applications involving large-scale superconductor
systems. These systems are typically made from hundreds to thousands of turns
of conductors. Due to the large number of turns, the simulations of a whole
system can become prohibitive in terms of computing time and load. Therefore,
an efficient strategy which does not compromise the accuracy of calculations is
needed. Recently, a method, based on a multi-scale approach, showed that the
computational load can be lowered by simulating, in detail, only several
significant tapes from the system. The main limitation of this approach is the
inaccuracy of the estimation of the background magnetic field. To address this
issue, we consider the following two complementary strategies. The first
strategy consists in the iterative implementation of the multi-scale method.
The multi-scale method solves itself a dynamic problem, the iterative
implementation proposed here is the iterative application of the multi-scale
method, and a dynamic solution is obtained at each iteration. The second
strategy is a new interpolation method for current distributions, based on the
inverse cumulative density function interpolation technique. With respect to
conventional interpolation methods, a more realistic current density
distribution is then obtained, which allows for a better estimation of the
background magnetic field, and consequently, a better estimation of the
hysteresis losses. In contrast with previous works, here we do not focus only
on the estimation of the hysteresis losses, but also the estimation of
background field and the current density distribution is addressed.

It has maximal supersymmetry and is superconformal. Very little is known about
this intriguing theory. While the spectrum of fields occurring in its

to constitute $\sim 10\%$ of the total BBH merger rate from GCs. Such GW
capture mergers can only be probed with an $N$-body code that includes General

learning well-separated mixtures of Gaussians and robust mean estimation, both
in high dimensions, that substantially improve upon the statistical guarantees
achieved by previous efficient algorithms.
  Firstly, we study mixtures of $k$ distributions in $d$ dimensions, where the
means of every pair of distributions are separated by at least
$k^{\varepsilon}$. In the special case of spherical Gaussian mixtures, we give
a $(dk)^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$-time algorithm that learns the means assuming
separation at least $k^{\varepsilon}$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$. This is the
first algorithm to improve on greedy (""single-linkage"") and spectral
clustering, breaking a long-standing barrier for efficient algorithms at
separation $k^{1/4}$.
  We also study robust estimation. When an unknown $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction
of $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are chosen from a sub-Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$
but the remaining points are chosen adversarially, we give an algorithm
recovering $\mu$ to error $\varepsilon^{1-1/t}$ in time $d^{O(t^2)}$, so long
as sub-Gaussian-ness up to $O(t)$ moments can be certified by a Sum of Squares
proof. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm with guarantees approaching
the information-theoretic limit for non-Gaussian distributions. Previous
algorithms could not achieve error better than $\varepsilon^{1/2}$.
  Both of these results are based on a unified technique. Inspired by recent
algorithms of Diakonikolas et al. in robust statistics, we devise an SDP based
on the Sum of Squares method for the following setting: given $X_1,\ldots,X_n
\in \mathbb{R}^d$ for large $d$ and $n = poly(d)$ with the promise that a
subset of $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ were sampled from a probability distribution with

the source location can be estimated by localizing the peaks of a pair of

the source localization mean squared error (MSE) faster than O(1/M^1.5) with M

four approximate approaches. Two of these, magneto-frictional relaxation and a
quasi-1D Grad-Shafranov approach, assume sequences of equilibria, whilst the

Reduced MHD, are time-dependent.
  The relaxation method is very accurate compared to full MHD for force-free
equilibria for all footpoint displacements but has significant errors when the
plasma $\beta_0$ is of order unity. The 1D approach gives an extremely accurate
description of the equilibria away from the photospheric boundary layers, and
agrees well with Lare2D for all parameter values tested. The linearised MHD
equations correctly predict the existence of photospheric boundary layers that
are present in the full MHD results. As soon as the footpoint displacement
becomes a significant fraction of the loop length, the RMHD method fails to

interesting in its own right, and care must be taken for low $\beta_0$ plasmas

small deep neural network architectures that are more suitable for edge
devices, with one of the most popular architectures being SqueezeNet, with an
incredibly small model size of 4.8MB. Taking further advantage of the notion
that many applications of machine learning on edge devices are often
characterized by a low number of target classes, this study explores the
utility of combining architectural modifications and an evolutionary synthesis
strategy for synthesizing even smaller deep neural architectures based on the
more recent SqueezeNet v1.1 macroarchitecture for applications with fewer
target classes. In particular, architectural modifications are first made to
SqueezeNet v1.1 to accommodate for a 10-class ImageNet-10 dataset, and then an
evolutionary synthesis strategy is leveraged to synthesize more efficient deep
neural networks based on this modified macroarchitecture. The resulting
SquishedNets possess model sizes ranging from 2.4MB to 0.95MB (~5.17X smaller
than SqueezeNet v1.1, or 253X smaller than AlexNet). Furthermore, the
SquishedNets are still able to achieve accuracies ranging from 81.2% to 77%,

understanding of the response of these instruments in the presence of
environmental and instrumental noise. Of particular interest is the study of
anomalous non-Gaussian noise transients known as glitches, since their high
occurrence rate in LIGO/Virgo data can obscure or even mimic true gravitational
wave signals. Therefore, successfully identifying and excising glitches is of
utmost importance to detect and characterize gravitational waves. In this
article, we present the first application of Deep Learning combined with
Transfer Learning for glitch classification, using real data from LIGO's first
discovery campaign labeled by Gravity Spy, showing that knowledge from
pre-trained models for real-world object recognition can be transferred for
classifying spectrograms of glitches. We demonstrate that this method enables
the optimal use of very deep convolutional neural networks for glitch
classification given small unbalanced training datasets, significantly reduces
the training time, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy above 98.8%. Once
trained via transfer learning, we show that the networks can be truncated and
used as feature extractors for unsupervised clustering to automatically group
together new classes of glitches and anomalies. This novel capability is of
critical importance to identify and remove new types of glitches which will
occur as the LIGO/Virgo detectors gradually attain design sensitivity.

dwarf galaxy (UFD). Previous tidal disruption studies of the Hercules UFD have
been hindered by the high degree of foreground contamination in the direction
of the dwarf. We bypass this issue by using RR Lyrae stars, which are standard
candles with a very low field-volume density at the distance of Hercules. We
use wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera on CTIO to identify
candidate RR Lyrae stars, supplemented with observations taken in coordination
with the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey on the Bok Telescope. Combining color,
magnitude, and light-curve information, we identify three new RR Lyrae stars
associated with Hercules. All three of these new RR Lyrae stars lie outside its
published tidal radius. When considered with the nine RR Lyrae stars already
known within the tidal radius, these results suggest that a substantial
fraction of Hercules' stellar content has been stripped. With this degree of
tidal disruption, Hercules is an interesting case between a visibly disrupted
dwarf (such as the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy) and one in dynamic
equilibrium. The degree of disruption also shows that we must be more careful
with the ways we determine object membership when estimating dwarf masses in
the future. One of the three discovered RR Lyrae stars sits along the minor
axis of Hercules, but over two tidal radii away. This type of debris is
consistent with recent models that suggest Hercules' orbit is aligned with its
minor axis.

emission observed from these pulsars is surprising, in that it implies that
cosmic-ray diffusion is significantly inhibited within ~25 pc of these objects,
compared to the expectations of standard Galactic diffusion models. This raises
the important question of whether the diffusion coefficient in the local
interstellar medium is also low, or whether it is instead better fit by the
mean Galactic value. Here, we utilize recent observations of the cosmic-ray
electron spectrum (extending up to ~20 TeV) by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration to
show that the local diffusion coefficient cannot be as low as it is in the

efficiently diffuse through the bulk of the local interstellar medium. Among
other implications, this further supports the conclusion that pulsars
significantly contribute to the observed positron excess.

the Standard Model (SM), since they do not generate loop corrections to the
potential $V(\phi)$. We consider such a coupling to SM gauge fields, of the
form $\phi F\tilde{F}/f$, with sub-Planckian $f$. In this case gauge fields can
be exponentially produced already {\it during inflation} and thermalize via
interactions with charged particles, as pointed out in previous work. This can
lead to a plasma of temperature $T$ during inflation and the thermal masses
$gT$ of the gauge bosons can equilibrate the system. In addition, inflaton
perturbations $\delta \phi$ can also have a thermal spectrum if they have
sufficiently large cross sections with the plasma. In this case inflationary
predictions are strongly modified: (1) scalar perturbations are thermal, and so
enhanced over the vacuum, leading to a generic way to {\it suppress} the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$; (2) the spectral index is $n_s-1=\eta-4\epsilon$.
After presenting the relevant conditions for thermalization, we show that
thermalized natural and monomial models of inflation agree with present

higher-dimensional operator as a complete UV model. In order to reach
consistent, model-independent EFT conclusions, it is necessary to truncate the
EFT effects consistently at order $1/\Lambda^2$ and to include the possibility
of multiple operators simultaneously contributing to the observables, neither
of which has been done in previous searches of this nature. Furthermore, it is
important to give consistent error estimates for the theoretical predictions of
the signal model, particularly in the region of phase space where the probed
energy is approaching the cutoff scale of the EFT. There are two linear
combinations of operators which contribute to dijet production in the SMEFT

determine the ability of LHC searches to constrain them simultaneously.
Consistently treating the EFT generically leads to weakened bounds on
new-physics parameters. These constraints will be a useful input to future

appears to coincide with the break in the halo's radial density profile at ~25

different types of accretion events are necessary to explain the observed RRab

and the total stellar content of a dwarf satellite, we hypothesize that the
field halo RRab composition is controlled by the mass of the progenitor
contributing the bulk of the stellar debris at the given radius. This idea is
tested against a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like

the high-$q^2$ hint may be explained by new short-ranged interactions, the
low-$q^2$ one cannot. We thus explore the possibility that the latter is
explained by a new light resonance. We find that LHCb's central value of
$R_{K^*}$ in the low-$q^2$ bin is achievable in a restricted parameter space of
new-physics scenarios in which the new, light resonance decays preferentially
to electrons and has a mass within approximately $10$ MeV of the di-muon
threshold. Interestingly, such an explanation can have a kinematic origin and
does not require a source of lepton-flavor universality violation. A
model-independent prediction is a narrow peak in the differential $B \to K^*
e^+e^-$ rate close to the di-muon threshold. If such a peak is observed, other
observables, such as the differential $B \to K e^+e^-$ rate and $R_K$, may be
employed to distinguish between models. However, if a low-mass resonance is not
observed and the low-$q^2$ anomaly increases in significance, then the case for
an experimental origin of the lepton-flavor universality violating anomalies
would be strengthened. To further explore this, we also point out that, in
analogy to $J/\psi$ decays, $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ decays of $\phi$ mesons
can be used as a cross check of lepton-flavor universality by LHCb with $5$

that the outcome of the contraction is stable to noise and that the estimated

numerically substantiate, follows from the positivity of operator scaling

follows from a particular assignment of physical qubits to different locations
of the tensor network plus the assumption that the noise model is local. We
postulate a scaling law for how well the tensor network can approximate ground
states of lattice regulated conformal field theories in d spatial dimensions
and provide evidence for the postulate. Under this postulate, a
$O(\log^{d}(1/\delta))$-qubit quantum computer can prepare a valid
quantum-mechanical state with energy density $\delta$ above the ground state.
In the presence of noise, $\delta = O(\epsilon \log^{d+1}(1/\epsilon))$ can be
achieved, where $\epsilon$ is the noise strength.

preventing hazardous chemical leakages, forest fires, or while estimating a
spatially distributed physical quantities such as terrain elevation. Although
prior methods can do such mapping tasks efficiently via dispatching a group of
autonomous agents, they are unable to ensure satisfactory convergence to the
underlying ground truth distribution in a decentralized manner when any of the
agents fail. Since the types of agents utilized to perform such mapping are
typically inexpensive and prone to failure, this results in poor overall
mapping performance in real-world applications, which can in certain cases
endanger human safety. This paper presents a Bayesian approach for robust
spatial mapping of environmental parameters by deploying a group of mobile
robots capable of ad-hoc communication equipped with short-range sensors in the
presence of hardware failures. Our approach first utilizes a variant of the
Voronoi diagram to partition the region to be mapped into disjoint regions that
are each associated with at least one robot. These robots are then deployed in
a decentralized manner to maximize the likelihood that at least one robot
detects every target in their associated region despite a non-zero probability
of failure. A suite of simulation results is presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method when compared to existing
techniques.

approach is strongly connected to the existing literature. Specifically, we
provide a new interpretation for popular sparsity inducing non-convex

four well-studied star-forming regions in local molecular clouds(MCs): Taurus,
Perseus, $\rho$ Ophiuchi, and Orion A. Using published mass and age estimates
for young stellar objects in each system, we show that the rate of star
formation over the last 10 Myrs has been accelerating and is (roughly)
consistent with a $t^2$ power law. This is in line with previous studies of the
star formation history of molecular clouds and with recent theoretical studies.
We further study the clustering of star formation in the Orion Nebula
Cluster(ONC). We examine the distribution of young stellar objects as a
function of their age by computing an effective half-light radius for these
young stars subdivided into age bins. We show that the distribution of young
stellar objects is broadly consistent with the star formation being entirely
localized within the central region. We also find a slow radial expansion of
the newly formed stars at a velocity of $v=0.17\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$, which is
roughly the sound speed of the cold molecular gas. This strongly suggests the
dense structures that form stars persist much longer than the local dynamical
time. We argue that this structure is quasi-static in nature and is likely the
result of the density profile approaching an attractor solution as suggested by
recent analytic and numerical analysis.

The need to amend ICH E9 grew out of the realization of a lack of alignment
between the objectives of a clinical trial stated in the protocol and the
accompanying quantification of the ""treatment effect"" reported in a regulatory
submission. We embed time-to-event endpoints in the estimand framework, and
discuss how the four estimand attributes described in the addendum apply to
time-to-event endpoints. We point out that if the proportional hazards
assumption is not met, the estimand targeted by the most prevalent methods used
to analyze time-to-event endpoints, logrank test and Cox regression, depends on
the censoring distribution. We discuss for a large randomized clinical trial
how the analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints as well as the
sensitivity analyses actually performed in the trial can be seen in the context
of the addendum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do
so for a trial with a time-to-event endpoint. Questions that remain open with
the addendum for time-to-event endpoints and beyond are formulated, and
recommendations for planning of future trials are given. We hope that this will
provide a contribution to developing a common framework based on the final

networks suffers the privacy issue that users need to give out their data to
the model (typically hosted in a server or a cluster on Cloud) for training or

or medical data (e.g fMRI or body sensors measures like EEG signals). In
addition to this, there is also a security risk of leaking these data during
the data transmission from user to the model (especially when it's through
Internet). Targeting at these issues, in this paper we proposed a new
architecture for deep network in which users don't reveal their original data
to the model. In our method, feed-forward propagation and data encryption are
combined into one process: we migrate the first layer of deep network to users'
local devices, and apply the activation functions locally, and then use
""dropping activation output"" method to make the output non-invertible. The
resulting approach is able to make model prediction without accessing users'
sensitive raw data. Experiment conducted in this paper showed that our approach
achieves the desirable privacy protection requirement, and demonstrated several
advantages over the traditional approach with encryption / decryption

velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) and low [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios for the

Maximization (NUM) provides a framework to optimize the rate allocation when
network resources are limited. Unfortunately, in the scenario where the amount
of available resources is not known a priori, classical NUM solving methods do
not offer a viable solution. To overcome this limitation we design an overlay
rate allocation scheme that attempts to infer the actual amount of available
network resources while coordinating the users rate allocation. Due to the
general and complex model assumed for the congestion measurements, a passive
learning of the available resources would not lead to satisfying performance.
The coordination scheme must then perform active learning in order to speed up
the resources estimation and quickly increase the system performance. By
adopting an optimal learning formulation we are able to balance the tradeoff
between an accurate estimation, and an effective resources exploitation in

bursts, and spikes have been observed almost simultaneously. Two phenomena have
been selected to show that the pulsations of radio emission are caused by
particles accelerated in the magnetic reconnection region and that the zebra

The complex combination of unusual fiber bursts, zebra structure, and spikes in

Solar Probe's unprecedented distances down to 9.86 Rs in its mission phase
during 2018-2025. The study is performed within the CGAUSS project which is the
German contribution to the PSP mission as part of the WISPR imager on PSP. We
present an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere which is
derived from OMNI and Helios data. The sunspot number (SSN) and its predictions
are used to derive dependencies of solar-wind parameters on solar activity and
to forecast them for the PSP mission. The frequency distributions for the
solar-wind key parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density,
and temperature, are represented by lognormal functions, considering the
velocity distribution's bi-componental shape. Functional relations to the SSN
are compiled using OMNI data and based on data from both Helios probes, the
parameters' frequency distributions are fitted with respect to solar distance.
Thus, an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere is derived,
accounting for solar activity and solar distance. The inclusion of SSN
predictions and the extrapolation down to PSP's perihelion region enables us to
estimate the solar-wind environment for PSP's planned trajectory during its
mission duration. This empirical model yields estimated solar-wind values for
PSP's 1st perihelion in 2018 at 0.16 au: 87 nT, 340 km s-1, 214 cm-3 and 503000
K. The estimates for PSP's first closest perihelion, occurring in 2024 at 0.046
au, are 943 nT, 290 km s-1, 2951 cm-3, and 1930000 K. Since the modeled
velocity and temperature values below approximately 20 Rs appear overestimated
in comparison with existing observations, this suggests that PSP will directly
measure solar-wind acceleration and heating processes below 20 Rs as planned.

goal of this paper is to demarcate which partition functions should be

finite-temperature path integrals for quantum field theories (QFTs) should be
T-reflection invariant. Because multi-particle partition functions are equal to
Euclidean path integrals for QFTs, we expect them to be T-reflection invariant.
Single-particle partition functions though are often not invariant under
T-reflection. Several exactly solvable systems are non-invariant under naive
T-reflection, but are likely invariant under an extended T-reflection. We give
example systems that are T-reflection invariant but are (1) non-unitary, (2)
chiral, (3) interacting, (4) non-supersymmetric, or (5) non-conformal, and (6)
argue that T-reflection is unrelated to time-reversal. Finally, we study the
interplay between T-reflection and perturbation theory in the anharmonic
harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics and in Yang-Mills in four-dimensions.

X-ray loud for their corresponding UV luminosities, but given that we measured
them in a historic high state, it is not clear whether to take the high-state
or low-state as typical of the properties of these HVAs. We estimate black hole
masses based on MgII and H$\alpha$ emission line profiles, and either the high
and low state luminosities, finding mass ranges $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) =
8.2-8.8$ and $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) = 7.9-8.3$ respectively. We then fit
energy conserving models to the SEDs, obtaining strong constraints on the
bolometric luminosity and $\alpha_{\rm OX}$. We compare the SED properties with
a larger, X-ray selected AGN sample for both of these scenarios, and observe
distinct groupings in spectral shape versus luminosity parameter space. In
general, the SED properties are closer to normal if we assume that the
low-state is representative. This supports the idea that the large slow
outbursts may be due to extrinsic effects (for example microlensing) as opposed
to accretion rate changes, but a larger sample of HVAs is needed to be

responsible for the spreading width of the populated single-particle states. We
see that the introduction of this complex potential gives rise to an additional

binding potentials. The equivalence is numerically tested for reaction induced

these algorithms consume orders of magnitude higher energy compared to the
human brain, mainly due to heavy data movements between the memory unit and the
computation cores. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) built using bio-plausible
neuron and synaptic models have emerged as the power-efficient choice for
designing cognitive applications. These algorithms involve several lookup-table
(LUT) based function evaluations such as high-order polynomials and
transcendental functions for solving complex neuro-synaptic models, that
typically require additional storage. To that effect, we propose `SPARE' - an
in-memory, distributed processing architecture built on ROM-embedded RAM
technology, for accelerating SNNs. ROM-embedded RAMs allow storage of LUTs,
embedded within a typical memory array, without additional area overhead. Our
proposed architecture consists of a 2-D array of Processing Elements (PEs).
Since most of the computations are done locally within each PE, unnecessary
data transfers are restricted, thereby alleviating the von-Neumann bottleneck.
We evaluate SPARE for two different ROM-Embedded RAM structures - CMOS based
ROM-Embedded SRAMs (R-SRAMs) and STT-MRAM based ROM-Embedded MRAMs (R-MRAMs).
Moreover, we analyze trade-offs in terms of energy, area and performance, for
using the two technologies on a range of image classification benchmarks.
Furthermore, we leverage the additional storage density to implement complex
neuro-synaptic functionalities. This enhances the utility of the proposed
architecture by provisioning implementation of any neuron/synaptic behavior as
necessitated by the application. Our results show up-to 1.75x, 1.95x and 1.95x
improvement in energy, iso-storage area, and iso-area performance,
respectively, by using neural network accelerators built on ROM-embedded RAM
primitives.

average distance among the molecules, neat and substantial changes in the power
spectrum of the time variation of a collective observable are found. As the
average intermolecular distance can be varied by changing the concentration of
the solvated molecules, and as the collective variable investigated is
proportional to the projection of the total dipole moment of the model
biomolecules on a coordinate plane, we have found a prospective experimental
strategy of spectroscopic kind to check whether the mentioned intermolecular

exceptional radiative output up to TeV energies, remain to be clarified. Most
likely, these physical processes take place at short separations from the
supermassive black hole, on scales which are inaccessible to VLBI observations
at centimeter wavelengths. Due to their high synchrotron opacity, the dense and

penetrated when observing at shorter wavelengths, in the millimeter and

have started to incorporate data sources from ubiquitous sensing devices, the
opportunity is to develop comprehensive models at urban scale leveraging
sources such as Global Positioning System (GPS) data and Call Detail Records.
We combine these big data sets in a novel method to model fuel consumption

so we calibrate a fuel consumption model for use on any car fleet fuel economy
distribution and apply it in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The model proposed, based on
speed profiles, is then used to test the effects on fuel consumption of
reducing flow, both randomly and by targeting the most fuel inefficient trips

decomposition of the Jacobian variety $JS$ of $S,$ called the group algebra
decomposition of $JS$ with respect to $H.$
  If $S_1 \to S_2$ is a regular covering map, then it is also known that the
group algebra decomposition of $JS_1$ induces an isogeny decomposition of
$JS_2.$
  In this article we deal with the converse situation. More precisely, we prove
that the group algebra decomposition can be lifted under regular covering maps,
under appropriate conditions.

generalizing deep learning techniques to graph domains. In this paper, we are
interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order
to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification,
graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused
on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of
graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have
been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two
fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review
existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of
LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of
analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph
matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures. Numerical
results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and
1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than
variational (non-learning) techniques. Finally, the most effective graph
ConvNet architecture uses gated edges and residuality. Residuality plays an
essential role to learn multi-layer architectures as they provide a 10% gain of
performance.

non-invasive and remote clinimetric testing of symptoms has considerable
potential. However, the clinimetric accuracy achievable with such technology is
highly reliant on separating the useful from irrelevant or confounded sensor
data. Monitoring patient symptoms using digital sensors outside of controlled,
clinical lab settings creates a variety of practical challenges, such as
unavoidable and unexpected user behaviours. These behaviours often violate the
assumptions of clinimetric testing protocols, where these protocols are
designed to probe for specific symptoms. Such violations are frequent outside
the lab, and can affect the accuracy of the subsequent data analysis and
scientific conclusions. At the same time, curating sensor data by hand after
the collection process is inherently subjective, laborious and error-prone. To
address these problems, we report on a unified algorithmic framework for
automated sensor data quality control, which can identify those parts of the
sensor data which are sufficiently reliable for further analysis. Algorithms
which are special cases of this framework for different sensor data types (e.g.
accelerometer, digital audio) detect the extent to which the sensor data
adheres to the assumptions of the test protocol for a variety of clinimetric
tests. The approach is general enough to be applied to a large set of
clinimetric tests and we demonstrate its performance on walking, balance and
voice smartphone-based tests, designed to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson's

of thin boundary layers poses both modelling and computational challenges. In
this paper, we derive simplified electro-neutral (EN) models where the thin
boundary layers are replaced by effective boundary conditions. There are two
major advantages of EN models. First of all, it is much cheaper to solve them
numerically. Secondly, EN models are easier to deal with compared with the
original PNP, therefore it is also easier to derive macroscopic models for
cellular structures using EN models.
  Even though the approach is applicable to higher dimensional cases, this
paper mainly focuses on the one-dimensional system, including the general
multi-ion case. Using systematic asymptotic analysis, we derive a variety of
effective boundary conditions directly applicable to EN system for the bulk
region. This EN system can be solved directly and efficiently without computing
the solution in the boundary layer. The derivation is based on matched
asymptotics, and the key idea is to bring back higher order contributions into
effective boundary conditions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the higher
order terms can be neglected and classical results (continuity of
electrochemical potential) are recovered. For flux boundary conditions,
however, neglecting higher contribution leads to physically incorrect solutions
since they account for accumulation of ions in boundary layer. The validity of
our EN model is verified by several examples and numerical computation. In
particular, our EN model is much more efficient than the original PNP model
when applied to the computation of membrane potential.

shells with rotation, framing it in the context of the weak cosmic censorship
conjecture. The analysis is based on a formalism developed specifically for
higher odd dimensions that is able to describe the dynamics of collapsing
rotating shells exactly. We analise and classify a plethora of shell
trajectories in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The parameters varied include
the shell's mass and angular momentum, its radial velocity at infinity, the
(linear) equation-of-state parameter and the spacetime dimensionality. We find
that plunges of rotating shells into black holes never produce naked
singularities, as long as the matter shell obeys the weak energy condition, and
so respect cosmic censorship. This applies to collapses of dust shells starting
from rest or with a finite velocity at infinity. Not even shells with a
negative isotropic pressure component (i.e., tension) lead to the formation of
naked singularities, as long as the weak energy condition is satisfied.
Endowing the shells with a positive isotropic pressure component allows the
existence of bouncing trajectories satisfying the dominant energy condition and
fully contained outside rotating black holes. Otherwise any turning point
occurs always inside the horizon. These results are based on strong numerical
evidence from scans of numerous sections in the large parameter space available
to these collapsing shells. The generalisation of the radial equation of motion

  Haystack: A Scan Statistics Perspective",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent results in coupled or temporal graphical models offer schemes for
estimating the relationship structure between features when the data come from
related (but distinct) longitudinal sources. A novel application of these ideas
is for analyzing group-level differences, i.e., in identifying if trends of
estimated objects (e.g., covariance or precision matrices) are different across
disparate conditions (e.g., gender or disease). Often, poor effect sizes make
detecting the differential signal over the full set of features difficult: for
example, dependencies between only a subset of features may manifest
differently across groups. In this work, we first give a parametric model for
estimating trends in the space of SPD matrices as a function of one or more
covariates. We then generalize scan statistics to graph structures, to search
over distinct subsets of features (graph partitions) whose temporal dependency
structure may show statistically significant group-wise differences. We
theoretically analyze the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) and bounds on Type 1
and Type 2 error. On a cohort of individuals with risk factors for Alzheimer's
disease (but otherwise cognitively healthy), we find scientifically interesting
group differences where the default analysis, i.e., models estimated on the
full graph, do not survive reasonable significance thresholds.

diamond is that optical illumination initializes its electronic spin almost
completely, a feature that can be exploited to polarize other spin species in
their proximity. Here we use field-cycled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to
investigate the mechanisms of spin polarization transfer from NVs to 13C spins
in diamond at room temperature. We focus on the dynamics near 51 mT, where a
fortuitous combination of energy matching conditions between electron and
nuclear spin levels gives rise to alternative polarization transfer channels.
By monitoring the 13C spin polarization as a function of the applied magnetic
field, we show 13C spin pumping takes place via a multi-spin cross relaxation
process involving the NV- spin and the electronic and nuclear spins of
neighboring P1 centers. Further, we find that this mechanism is insensitive to
the crystal orientation relative to the magnetic field, although the absolute
level of 13C polarization - reaching up to ~3% under optimal conditions - can
vary substantially depending on the interplay between optical pumping
efficiency, photo-generated carriers, and laser-induced heating.

in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). One of the ways to query these KGs is to
use SPARQL queries over a database engine. Since SPARQL follows exact match
semantics, the queries may return too few or no results. Recent works have
proposed query relaxation where the query engine judiciously replaces a query
predicate with similar predicates using weighted relaxation rules mined from
the KG. The space of possible relaxations is potentially too large to fully
explore and users are typically interested in only top-k results, so such query
engines use top-k algorithms for query processing. However, they may still
process all the relaxations, many of whose answers do not contribute towards
top-k answers. This leads to computation overheads and delayed response times.
  We propose Spec-QP, a query planning framework that speculatively determines
which relaxations will have their results in the top-k answers. Only these
relaxations are processed using the top-k operators. We, therefore, reduce the
computation overheads and achieve faster response times without adversely
affecting the quality of results. We tested Spec-QP over two datasets - XKG and
Twitter, to demonstrate the efficiency of our planning framework at reducing
runtimes with reasonable accuracy for query engines supporting relaxations.

based on their preferences. IPTV users must ensure their sensitive preferences
collected by any recommendation service are properly secured. In this work, we
introduce a framework for private recommender service based on Enhanced
Middleware for Collaborative Privacy (EMCP). EMCP executes a two-stage
concealment process that gives the user a complete control on the privacy level
of his/her profile. We utilize trust mechanism to augment the accuracy and
privacy of the recommendations. Trust heuristic spot users who are trustworthy
with respect to the user requesting the recommendation. Later, the neighborhood
formation is calculated using proximity metrics based on these trustworthy
users. Finally, Users submit their profiles in an obfuscated form without
revealing any information about their data, and the computation of
recommendations proceeds over the obfuscated data using secure multiparty
computation protocol. We expand the obfuscation scope from single obfuscation
level for all users to arbitrary obfuscation levels based on trustworthy
between users. In other words, we correlate the obfuscation level with
different trust levels, so the more trusted a target user is the less
obfuscation copy of profile he can access. We also provide an IPTV network
scenario and experimentation results. Our results and analysis show that our
two-stage concealment process not only protects the privacy of users but also
can maintain the recommendations accuracy.

(ISR) jet has been a useful strategy for searches of supersymmetry with a
compressed spectrum at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the case of the top
squark (stop), the ratio of the missing transverse momentum from the lightest
neutralinos and the ISR momentum, defined as $\bar{R}_M$, turns out to be an
effective variable to distinguish the signal from the backgrounds. It has
helped to exclude the stop mass below 590 GeV along the top corridor where
$m_{\tilde{t}} - m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \approx m_t$. On the other hand, the
current experimental limit is still rather weak in the $W$ corridor where
$m_{\tilde{t}} - m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \approx m_W +m_b$. In this work we extend
this strategy to the parameter region around the $W$ corridor by considering
the one lepton final state. In this case the kinematic constraints are
insufficient to completely determine the neutrino momentum which is required to
calculate $\bar{R}_M$. However, the minimum value of $\bar{R}_M$ consistent
with the kinematic constraints still provides a useful discriminating variable,
allowing the exclusion reach of the stop mass to be extended to $\sim 550$ GeV
based on the current 36 fb$^{-1}$ LHC data. The same method can also be applied
to the chargino search with $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm} -m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}
\approx m_W$ because the analysis does not rely on $b$ jets. If no excess is
present in the current data, a chargino mass of 300 GeV along the $W$ corridor
can be excluded, beyond the limit obtained from the multilepton search.

common metric space, and cardinal preferences are naturally given by distances
in the metric space. In a positional voting rule, each candidate receives a
score from each ballot based on the ballot's rank order; the candidate with the
highest total score wins the election. The cost of a candidate is his sum of
distances to all voters, and the distortion of an election is the ratio between
the cost of the elected candidate and the cost of the optimum candidate. We
consider the case when candidates are representative of the population, in the
sense that they are drawn i.i.d. from the population of the voters, and analyze
the expected distortion of positional voting rules.
  Our main result is a clean and tight characterization of positional voting
rules that have constant expected distortion (independent of the number of
candidates and the metric space). Our characterization result immediately
implies constant expected distortion for Borda Count and elections in which
each voter approves a constant fraction of all candidates. On the other hand,
we obtain super-constant expected distortion for Plurality, Veto, and approving
a constant number of candidates. These results contrast with previous results
on voting with metric preferences: When the candidates are chosen
adversarially, all of the preceding voting rules have distortion linear in the
number of candidates or voters. Thus, the model of representative candidates
allows us to distinguish voting rules which seem equally bad in the worst case.

is compared to a previous formulation where the surface and energy functional
are discretized before forces are computed. For the case of Stokes flow, a
method for computing quadrature weights is provided to ensure the integral of
the elastic spread force density remains zero throughout a dynamic simulation.
Tests on the method are conducted and show that it yields more accurate force
computations than previous formulations as well as more accurate geometric
information such as mean curvature. The method is then applied to a model of a
red blood cell in capillary flow and a 3D model of cellular blebbing.

Answering task in that the agent needs to answer a question about an image, but

GAN is tightly integrated into the attention mechanism that generates
human-interpretable reasons for each answer. This means that the discriminative

because it drives the generative model to produce high quality answers that are
well supported by the associated reasoning. The method also generates the

432 (2016)]. This remarkable progress enables an energy-efficient spin-wave
propagation with a well-defined wave vector along its propagating path inside
the wall. In the mentioned experiment, a micro-focus Brillouin light scattering
spectroscopy was taken in a line-scans manner to measure the frequency of the
bounded spin wave. Due to their localization nature, the confined spin waves
can hardly be detected from outside the wall channel, which guarantees the
information security to some extent. In this work, we theoretically propose a
scheme to detect/eavesdrop on the spin waves inside the domain-wall nanochannel
via nonlinear three-magnon processes. We send a spin wave in one magnetic
domain to interact with the bounded mode in the wall. Two kinds of three-magnon
processes, i.e., confluence and splitting, are expected to occur. The
confluence process is conventional. We predict a stimulated three-magnon
splitting (or ""magnon laser"") effect: the presence of a bound magnon
propagating along the domain wall channel assists the splitting of the incident
wave into two modes, one of which is identical to the bound mode in the
channel. Micromagnetic simulations confirm our theoretical analysis. These
results demonstrate that one is able to uniquely infer the spectrum of the
spin-wave in the domain-wall nanochannel once we know both the injection and
the transmitted waves.

sorting is possible. The underlying mechanism here is cell migration due to the
cell's positive inclination and the shear gradient. The higher the inclination
is, the farther the cell can travel laterally. We also assess the efficiency of
the technique for dense suspensions. It turns out that most of the cells in

manner. For this problem, maximin share (MMS) is a well-studied solution
concept which provides a fairness threshold. Specifically, maximin share is
defined as the minimum utility that an agent can guarantee for herself when
asked to partition the set of goods into n bundles such that the remaining
(n-1) agents pick their bundles adversarially. An allocation is deemed to be
fair if every agent gets a bundle whose valuation is at least her maximin
share.
  Even though maximin shares provide a natural benchmark for fairness, it has
its own drawbacks and, in particular, it is not sufficient to rule out
unsatisfactory allocations. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we
define a stronger notion of fairness, called groupwise maximin share guarantee
(GMMS). In GMMS, we require that the maximin share guarantee is achieved not
just with respect to the grand bundle, but also among all the subgroups of
agents. Hence, this solution concept strengthens MMS and provides an ex-post
fairness guarantee. We show that in specific settings, GMMS allocations always
exist. We also establish the existence of approximate GMMS allocations under
additive valuations, and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to find such
allocations. Moreover, we establish a scale of fairness wherein we show that
GMMS implies approximate envy freeness.
  Finally, we empirically demonstrate the existence of GMMS allocations in a
large set of randomly generated instances. For the same set of instances, we
additionally show that our algorithm achieves an approximation factor better
than the established, worst-case bound.

uniform recovery guarantees for these decoders, deriving recipes for the

compare them in the pure function approximation case and in applications to
uncertainty quantification of ODEs and PDEs with random inputs. Our main
conclusion is that the lesser-known square-root LASSO is better suited for

detection is unrelated to the radius of an AFM tip, and in fact, a matter of

is neutral and radial along the magnetic field lines of a split monopole in a
Schwarzschild spacetime. A combined mechanism of dragging by the black hole's
spin and the Lorentz force produces charge separation and current flow, and
hence electric and toroidal magnetic fields. By WKB analysis, two classes of
solutions of perturbation equations for small black hole spin are identified:
one is related to inward flux, and the amplitude inwardly increases; the other
generates an outward flux with a peak position around $r=3M$, tending to zero
at the horizon. The power induced by the two-fluid effect is inversely

situations. A magnetic vacuum region is located elsewhere for effective

values at any location and time point. Such inferences are not only required to
answer important questions about our climate, but they are also needed for
validating the satellite instrument, since Level 2 retrievals are generally not
co-located with ground-based remote sensing instruments. Here, we discuss
statistical approaches to construct Level 3 products from Level 2 retrievals,
placing particular emphasis on the strengths and potential pitfalls when using
statistical prediction in this context. Following this discussion, we use a
spatio-temporal statistical modelling framework known as fixed rank kriging
(FRK) to obtain global predictions and prediction standard errors of
column-averaged carbon dioxide based on Version 7r and Version 8r retrievals
from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. The FRK predictions
allow us to validate statistically the Level 2 retrievals globally even though
the data are at locations and at time points that do not coincide with
validation data. Importantly, the validation takes into account the prediction
uncertainty, which is dependent both on the temporally-varying density of
observations around the ground-based measurement sites and on the
spatio-temporal high-frequency components of the trace gas field that are not
explicitly modelled. Here, for validation of remotely-sensed CO$_2$ data, we
use observations from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network. We demonstrate
that the resulting FRK product based on Version 8r compares better with TCCON

symmetry, whose breaking leads to the lepton number violating mass of the heavy
Majorana neutrinos. This would imply the existence of a new neutral scalar
associated with the $B-L$ symmetry breaking, analogous to the Higgs boson of
the Standard Model. If in such models, the heavy neutrino decays are also
responsible for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via the
leptogenesis mechanism, the new seesaw scalar interactions with the heavy
neutrinos will induce additional dilution terms for the heavy neutrino and
lepton number densities. We make a detailed study of this dilution effect on
the lepton asymmetry in three generic classes of seesaw models with TeV-scale
$B-L$ symmetry breaking, namely, in an effective theory framework and in
scenarios with global or local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. We find that requiring
successful leptogenesis imposes stringent constraints on the mass and couplings
of the new scalar in all three cases, especially when it is lighter than the
heavy neutrinos. We also discuss the implications of these new constraints and
prospects of testing leptogenesis in presence of seesaw scalars at colliders.

narrow with time, which is interpreted as a shock expanding into the red giant
wind. Using the photoionisation code CLOUDY, spectra at nine epochs spanning 14
months after the outburst peak, thus covering a broad range of ionisation and
excitation levels in the ejecta, are modelled. The best-fit model parameters

change over time, often in uncoordinated ways and at irregular intervals. For
example, university students connect in intermittent groups that repeatedly
form and dissolve based on multiple factors, including their lectures,
interests, and friends. Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer
networks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In
this representation, it is crucial that the links between layers accurately
capture real dependencies between those layers. Often, however, these
dependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers based on
simplistic assumptions that do not capture node-level layer dependencies. For
example, connecting every node to itself in other layers with the same weight
can wipe out dependencies between intermittent groups, making it difficult or
even impossible to identify them. In this paper, we present a principled
approach to estimating node-level layer dependencies based on the network
structure within each layer. We implement our node-level coupling method in the
community detection framework Infomap and demonstrate its performance compared
to current methods on synthetic and real temporal networks. We show that our
approach more effectively constrains information inside multilayer communities
so that Infomap can better recover planted groups in multilayer benchmark
networks that represent multiple modes with different groups and better
identify intermittent communities in real temporal contact networks. These
results suggest that node-level layer coupling can improve the modeling of
information spreading in temporal networks and better capture intermittent
community structure.

future power system. To make WAMS construction plans, practical models of the
power network observability, reliability, and underlying communication
infrastructures need to be considered. To address this challenging problem, in
this paper we propose a unified framework for WAMS planning to cover most
realistic concerns in the construction process. The framework jointly optimizes
the system construction cost, measurement reliability, and volume of
synchrophasor data traffic resulting in a multi-objective optimization problem,
which provides multiple Pareto optimal solutions to suit different requirements
by the utilities. The framework is verified on two IEEE test systems. The
simulation results demonstrate the trade-off relationships among the proposed
objectives. Moreover, the proposed framework can develop optimal WAMS plans for
full observability with minimal cost. This work develops a comprehensive
framework for most practical WAMS construction designs.

applications. However, most existing networks are typically designed in
heuristic manners, thus lack of rigorous mathematical principles and
derivations. Several recent studies build deep structures by unrolling a
particular optimization model that involves task information. Unfortunately,
due to the dynamic nature of network parameters, their resultant deep
propagation networks do \emph{not} possess the nice convergence property as the
original optimization scheme does. This paper provides a novel proximal
unrolling framework to establish deep models by integrating experimentally
verified network architectures and rich cues of the tasks. More importantly, we
\emph{prove in theory} that 1) the propagation generated by our unrolled deep
model globally converges to a critical-point of a given variational energy, and
2) the proposed framework is still able to learn priors from training data to
generate a convergent propagation even when task information is only partially
available. Indeed, these theoretical results are the best we can ask for,
unless stronger assumptions are enforced. Extensive experiments on various
real-world applications verify the theoretical convergence and demonstrate the
effectiveness of designed deep models.

heavy-metal thickness in ferromagnet/normal metal (FM/NM) bilayers is critical
for the development of magnetic memory based on SOT. However, several
experiments have revealed an apparent discrepancy between damping enhancement
and damping-like SOT regarding their dependence on NM thickness. Here, using
linewidth and phase-resolved amplitude analysis of vector network analyzer
ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) measurements, we simultaneously extract
damping enhancement and both field-like and damping-like inverse SOT in
Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt bilayers as a function of Pt thickness. By enforcing an
interpretation of the data which satisfies Onsager reciprocity, we find that
both the damping enhancement and damping-like inverse SOT can be described by a
single spin diffusion length ($\approx$ 4 nm), and that we can separate the
spin pumping and spin memory loss (SML) contributions to the total damping.
This analysis indicates that less than 40% of the angular momentum pumped by
FMR through the Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt interface is transported as spin current
into the Pt. On account of the SML and corresponding reduction in total spin
current available for spin-charge transduction in the Pt, we determine the Pt
spin Hall conductivity ($\sigma_\mathrm{SH} = (2.36 \pm 0.04)\times10^6
\Omega^{-1} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$) and bulk spin Hall angle
($\theta_\mathrm{SH}=0.387 \pm0.008$) to be larger than commonly-cited values.
These results suggest that Pt can be an extremely useful source of SOT if the
FM/NM interface can be engineered to minimize SML. Lastly, we find that
self-consistent fitting of the damping and SOT data is best achieved by a model
with Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation and extrinsic inverse spin Hall effect, such
that both the spin diffusion length and spin Hall conductivity are proportional
to the Pt charge conductivity.

This paper explores the idea of learning temporal gates for sequence pairs

pairwise manner. In our approach, temporal gates are learned via 1D
convolutional layers and then subsequently cross applied across question and
answer for joint learning. Empirically, we show that this conceptually simple

Based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a classification

updated microphysics input. The consideration of short timescales ($\lesssim1$
yr) is made possible by a treatment of the heat-blanketing envelope without the
quasistationary approximation inherent to its treatment in traditional

observations. Suppression of radiative and conductive opacities in strongly
quantizing magnetic fields and formation of a condensed radiating surface
substantially enhance the photon luminosity at early ages, making the life of
magnetars brighter but shorter. These effects together with the effect of
strong proton superfluidity, which slows down the cooling of kiloyear-aged
neutron stars, can explain thermal luminosities of about a half of magnetars

system and the electron spectra, experimentally accessible by photoemission. In
a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 236402 (2015)], we introduced the
""fluctuation diagnostics"" approach, to extract the dominant wave vector
dependent bosonic fluctuations from the electronic self-energy. Here, we first
reformulate the theory in terms of fermionic modes, to render its connection
with resonance valence bond (RVB) fluctuations more transparent. Secondly, by
using a large-U expansion, where U is the Coulomb interaction, we relate the
fluctuations to real space correlations. Therefore, it becomes possible to
study how electron spectra are related to charge, spin, superconductivity and
RVB-like real space correlations, broadening the analysis of an earlier work
[Phys. Rev. B 89, 245130 (2014)]. This formalism is applied to the pseudogap
physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, studied in the dynamical cluster
approximation. We perform calculations for embedded clusters with up to 32
sites, having three inequivalent K-points at the Fermi surface. We find that as
U is increased, correlation functions gradually attain values consistent with
an RVB state. This first happens for correlation functions involving the
antinodal point and gradually spreads to the nodal point along the Fermi
surface. Simultaneously a pseudogap opens up along the Fermi surface. We relate
this to a crossover from a Kondo-like state to an RVB-like localized cluster
state and to the presence of RVB and spin fluctuations. These changes are
caused by a strong momentum dependence in the cluster bath-couplings along the
Fermi surface. We also show, from a more algorithmic perspective, how the
time-consuming calculations in fluctuation diagnostics can be drastically
simplified.

luminosity. With X-ray monitoring observations in the past decade, we were able
to identify state transitions towards the lowest luminosity limit in 4U
0614+091, 2S 0918-549 and 4U 1246-588. By analysing corresponding X-ray pointed
observations with the Swift/XRT and the RXTE/PCA, we found no hysteresis of
state transitions in these sources, and determined the critical mass accretion
rate in the range of 0.002 - 0.04 $\dot{\rm M}_{\rm Edd}$ and 0.003 - 0.05
$\dot{\rm M}_{\rm Edd}$ for the hard-to-soft and the soft-to-hard transition,
respectively, by assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 solar masses. This range
is comparable to the lowest transition luminosity measured in black hole X-ray
binaries, indicating the critical mass accretion rate is not affected by the
nature of the surface of the compact stars. Our result does not support the
Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model which predicts that the
critical mass accretion rate in neutron star systems is an order of magnitude
lower if same viscosity parameters are taken. The low transition luminosity and
insignificant hysteresis in these ultracompact X-ray binaries provide further
evidence that the transition luminosity is likely related to the mass in the
disc.

(FQHSs), fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) are envisioned as strongly
correlated, incompressible states emerging in a fractionally filled, (nearly)
flat band with non-trivial Chern number. Built upon this vision, fractional
topological insulators (FTIs) have been proposed as being composed of two
independent copies of the FCI with opposite Chern numbers for different spins,
preserving the time-reversal symmetry as a whole. An important question is if
the correlation between electrons with different spins can be really ignored.
To address this question, we investigate the effects of correlation in the
presence of spin-dependent holomorphicity, i.e., electrons of one spin species
reside in the holomorphic lowest Landau level, while those of the other in the
antiholomorphic counterpart. By constructing and performing exact
diagonalization of an appropriate model Hamiltonian, here, we show that
generic, strongly correlated, fractionally filled states with spin-dependent
holomorphicity cannot be described as two independent copies of the FQHS,
suggesting that FTIs in the lattice cannot be described as those of the FCI
either. Fractionally filled states in this system are generally compressible
except at half filling, where an insulating state called the half-filled
spin-holomorphic FTI occurs. It is predicted that the half-filled
spin-holomorphic FTI is susceptible to an inherent spontaneous symmetry
breaking, leading to the spatial separation of spins.

  Series (JPCS)",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The CRESST experiment, located at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in
Italy, searches for dark matter particles via their elastic scattering off
nuclei in a target material. The CRESST target consists of scintillating
CaWO$_4$ crystals, which are operated as cryogenic calorimeters at millikelvin
temperatures. Each interaction in the CaWO$_4$ target crystal produces a phonon
signal and a light signal that is measured by a second cryogenic calorimeter.
Since the CRESST-II result in 2015, the experiment is leading the field of
direct dark matter search for dark matter masses below 1.7\,GeV/$c^2$,
extending the reach of direct searches to the sub-GeV/$c^2$ mass region. For
CRESST-III, whose Phase 1 started in July 2016, detectors have been optimized
to reach the performance required to further probe the low-mass region with
unprecedented sensitivity. In this contribution the achievements of the
CRESST-III detectors will be discussed together with preliminary results and
perspectives of Phase 1.

  presentation",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dueling bandit is a learning framework wherein the feedback information
in the learning process is restricted to a noisy comparison between a pair of
actions. In this research, we address a dueling bandit problem based on a cost
function over a continuous space. We propose a stochastic mirror descent
algorithm and show that the algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$-regret
bound under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions for the cost function.
Subsequently, we clarify the equivalence between regret minimization in dueling
bandit and convex optimization for the cost function. Moreover, when
considering a lower bound in convex optimization, our algorithm is shown to
achieve the optimal convergence rate in convex optimization and the optimal
regret in dueling bandit except for a logarithmic factor.

feature computation or superpixel generation. We show that this network yields
better results than existing methods on different public data sets. For
evaluation of this model we introduce a novel metric that is independent of
ambiguous ground truth called Foreground Pixel Accuracy (FgPA). This pixel
based measure only counts foreground pixels in the binarized page, any
background pixel is omitted. The major advantage of this metric is, that it
enables researchers to compare different segmentation methods on their ability
to successfully segment text or pictures and not on their ability to learn and
possibly overfit the peculiarities of an ambiguous hand-made ground truth

an interaction of the high speed wind from WC8 central star (CS) with the
nebula. It shows strong Civ 1550 {\AA} emission that cannot be explained by
thermal processes alone. We present here the first map of this nebula in C IV
emission, using broad band filters on the UVIT.
  Aims. To map the hot C IV emitting gas and its correspondence with soft X-ray
(0.3-8 keV) emitting regions, in order to study the shock interaction with the
nebula and the ISM. This also illustrates the potential of UVIT for nebular
studies.
  Methods. Morphological study of images of the nebula obtained at an angular
resolution of about 1.3"" in four UVIT filter bands that include C IV 1550 {\AA}
and C II] 2326 {\AA} lines and UV continuum. Comparisons with X-ray, optical,
and IR images from literature.
  Results. The C II] 2326 {\AA} images show the core of the nebula with two
lobes on either side of CS similar to [N II]. The C IV emission in the core
shows similar morphology and extant as that of diffuse X-ray emission
concentrated in nebular condensations. A surprising UVIT discovery is the
presence of a large faint FUV halo in FUV Filter with {\lambda}eff of 1608
{\AA}. The UV halo is not present in any other UV filter. FUV halo is most
likely due to UV fluorescence emission from the Lyman bands of H2 molecules.
Unlike the optical and IR halo, FUV halo trails predominantly towards
south-east side of the nebular core, opposite to the CS's proper motion
direction.
  Conclusions. Morphological similarity of C IV 1550 {\AA} and X-ray emission
in the core suggests that it results mostly from interaction of strong CS wind
with the nebula. The FUV halo in NGC 40 highlights the existence of H2
molecules extensively in the regions even beyond the optical and IR halos.

Gaia-ESO Survey data, enable the comparison of observed open star cluster
sequences with stellar evolutionary models. The final, long-term goal is the
exploitation of open clusters as age calibrators. We perform a homogeneous
analysis of eight open clusters using the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue for bright
members, and information from the Gaia-ESO Survey for fainter stars. Cluster
membership probabilities for the Gaia-ESO Survey targets are derived based on
several spectroscopic tracers. The Gaia-ESO Survey also provides the cluster
chemical composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first
one relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide members, while
the other one fits the parallax distribution of a larger sample of TGAS
sources. Ages and reddening values are recovered through a Bayesian analysis
using the 2MASS magnitudes and three sets of standard models. Lithium depletion
boundary (LDB) ages are also determined using literature observations and the
same models employed for the Bayesian analysis. For all but one cluster,
parallaxes derived by us agree with those presented in Gaia Collaboration et
al. (2017), while a discrepancy is found for NGC 2516; we provide evidence
supporting our own determination. Inferred cluster ages are robust against
models and are generally consistent with literature values. The systematic
parallax errors inherent in the Gaia DR1 data presently limit the precision of
our results. Nevertheless, we have been able to place these eight clusters onto
the same age scale for the first time, with good agreement between isochronal
and LDB ages where there is overlap. Our approach appears promising and
demonstrates the potential of combining Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic
datasets.

given a set of n axis-aligned rectangular items, each one with an associated
profit, and an axis-aligned square knapsack. The goal is to find a
(non-overlapping) packing of a maximum profit subset of items inside the
knapsack (without rotating items). The best-known polynomial-time approximation
factor for this problem (even just in the cardinality case) is (2 + \epsilon)

  In this paper, we break the 2 approximation barrier, achieving a
polynomial-time (17/9 + \epsilon) < 1.89 approximation, which improves to
(558/325 + \epsilon) < 1.72 in the cardinality case. Essentially all prior work
on 2DK approximation packs items inside a constant number of rectangular
containers, where items inside each container are packed using a simple greedy
strategy. We deviate for the first time from this setting: we show that there

PTAS for this case. We believe that this will turn out to be useful in future
work in geometric packing problems.
  We also consider the variant of the problem with rotations (2DKR), where
items can be rotated by 90 degrees. Also, in this case, the best-known
polynomial-time approximation factor (even for the cardinality case) is (2 +
\epsilon) [Jansen and Zhang, SODA 2004]. Exploiting part of the machinery
developed for 2DK plus a few additional ideas, we obtain a polynomial-time (3/2
+ \epsilon)-approximation for 2DKR, which improves to (4/3 + \epsilon) in the
cardinality case.

rational points over local fields, and so, if it satisfies a local-global

enough roots of unity.
  At the heart of the paper is the construction of a finite group $\tilde
U_5(\mathbb{F}_p)$, which has $U_5(\mathbb{F}_p)$ as a quotient. Here
$U_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is the group of unipotent $n\times n$-matrices with entries
in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ with p elements; it is classical that
$U_{n+1}(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is intimately related to n-fold Massey products.
Although $\tilde U_5(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is much larger than $U_5(\mathbb{F}_p)$,
its definition is very natural, and for our purposes, it is easier to study.

ways to find invariant Markov laws for a given jump rate matrix or to prove
that none exists. The voter models and the contact processes are shown not to

of observations of a stellar cycle ever obtained for a Sun-like star, we show
how the solar analog HD 173701 exhibits solar-like differential rotation and a
7.4-year activity cycle. While the duration of the cycle is comparable to that
generated by the solar dynamo, the amplitude of the brightness variability is
substantially stronger. The only significant difference between HD 173701 and
the Sun is its metallicity, which is twice the solar value. Therefore, this
provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the higher metallicity on
the dynamo acting in this star and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of
the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed photometric variability.
The observations can be explained by the higher metallicity of the star, which
is predicted to foster a deeper outer convection zone and a higher facular
contrast, resulting in stronger variability.

lines and puts strong constraints on the line centroid and width. The line
width corresponds to the velocity of 160^{+300}_{-70} km s^{-1}. This
represents the most accurate, and smallest, width measurement of this line made
so far from any X-ray binary, much less than the Doppler broadening and shift
expected from speeds which are characteristic of similar systems. Combined with
the K-shell edge energy measured by the SXI and HXI spectra, the ionization
state of Fe is estimated to be in the range of Fe I--IV. Considering the
estimated ionization parameter and the distance between the X-ray source and
the absorber, the density and thickness of the materials are estimated. The
extraordinarily strong absorption and the absence of a Compton shoulder
component is confirmed. These characteristics suggest reprocessing materials
which are distributed in a narrow solid angle or scattering primarily with warm
free electrons or neutral hydrogen.

fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on planar plasmonic antenna arrays with
different nanogap sizes to assess the dynamic nanoscale organization of mimetic

confined excitation light provided by the nanoantennas together with their
outstanding planarity to investigate membrane regions as small as 10 nm in size

coexistence of transient nanoscopic domains in both the liquid-ordered and the
liquid-disordered microscopic phases of multicomponent lipid bilayers. These
nanodomains have characteristic residence times between 30 and 150 {\mu}s and
sizes around 10 nm, as inferred from the diffusion data. Thus, although
microscale phase separation occurs on mimetic membranes, nanoscopic domains
also coexist, suggesting that these transient assemblies might be similar to
those occurring in living cells, which in the absence of raft-stabilizing

heterogeneous orders and rules that force the implementation of heuristic and
iterative solving methods. In particular, curtailable block orders and the
uniform purchase price (UPP) pose serious difficulties. A block is an order
that spans over multiple hours, and can be either fully accepted or fully
rejected. The UPP prescribes that all consumers pay a common price, i.e., the
UPP, in all the zones, while producers receive zonal prices, which can differ
from one zone to another.
  The market clearing problem in the presence of both the UPP and block orders
is a major open issue in the European context. The UPP scheme leads to a
non-linear optimization problem involving both primal and dual variables,
whereas block orders introduce multi-temporal constraints and binary variables
into the problem. As a consequence, the market clearing problem in the presence
of both blocks and the UPP can be regarded as a non-linear integer programming
problem involving both primal and dual variables with complementary and
multi-temporal constraints.
  The aim of this paper is to present a non-iterative and heuristic-free
approach for solving the market clearing problem in the presence of both
curtailable block orders and the UPP. The solution is exact, with no
approximation up to the level of resolution of current market data. By
resorting to an equivalent UPP formulation, the proposed approach results in a
mixed-integer linear program, which is built starting from a non-linear integer
bilevel programming problem. Numerical results using real market data are
reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The model has been
implemented in Python, and the code is freely available on a public repository.

for training DBMs with intra-layer connections between the hidden nodes.
Experiments with MNIST and Fashion MNIST demonstrate that VPF learns reasonable
features quickly, reconstructs corrupted images more accurately, and generates
samples with a high estimated log-likelihood. Lastly, we note that,
interestingly, if an asymmetric version of VPF exists, the weight updates
directly explain experimental results in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity

rotation and the properties of rotating stars appear as the key factor. In
binaries, the interaction between axial rotation and tidal effects often leads
to interesting and unexpected results. Rotation plays a key role in shaping the
evolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars with very low metallicities
(metallicity below about the Small Magellanic Cloud metallicity down to
Population III stars). At solar and higher metallicities, the effects of
rotation compete with those of stellar winds. In close binaries, the
synchronisation process can lock the star at a high rotation rate despite
strong mass loss and thus both effects, rotation and stellar winds, have a
strong impact. In conclusion, rotation is a key physical ingredient of the
stellar models and of presupernova stages, and the evolution both of single

applications in fields ranging from drug delivery to sonoluminesce. This
phenomenon has been widely studied for cases where the amplitude of the forcing
remains constant over time. However, in many practical applications, the
duration of the forcing is not long enough for the bubble to attain a constant
translational velocity, mainly due to the effect of the history force. Here, we
develop a formulation, valid in the limit of very viscous flow and
small-amplitude acoustic forcing, that allows us to describe the transient
dynamics of bubbles driven by acoustic pulses consisting of a finite number of
cycles. We also present an asymptotic solution to this theory for the case of a
finite-duration sinusoidal pressure pulse. This solution takes into account
both the history integral term and the transient period that the bubble needs
to achieve steady radial oscillations, being the former dominant during most of
the acceleration process. Moreover, by introducing some additional assumptions,
we derive a simplified formula that describes fairly well the time evolution of
the bubble velocity. Using this solution we show that the convergence to the
steady translational velocity, given by the so-called Bjerknes force, occurs
rather slowly, namely as $\tau^{-1/2}$, which explains the slow convergence of
the bubble velocity and stresses the importance of taking into account the

any external parameter control. We identify four different regimes as time
evolves: (i) the conductive regime, (ii) linear regime, (iii) coarsening regime
and (iv) turbulent regime. The first two regimes appear at all domain sizes.
However the third and fourth regime require a minimum advance of the

  The transition to turbulence takes places after a secondary instability that
forces the coarsening of the thermal plumes. Each one of the melting regimes
creates a distinct solid/liquid front that characterizes the internal state of

atmospheric escape. Specifically, we compare the actual possible atmospheres to
a threshold thickness above which a primordial (H$_2$-dominated) atmosphere can
be retained against evaporation over the planet's lifetime. The best
constrained parameters are the individual layer thicknesses. The maximum radius
fraction of possible atmospheres are 0.18 and 0.13 $R$ (radius), for planets b

cannot be uniquely determined. Our main conclusions are: (1) the possible
atmospheres for planets b and c are enriched and thus possibly secondary in
nature, and (2) both planets may contain a gas layer, whereas the layer of HD
219134 b must be larger. HD 219134 c can be rocky.

  the AVL RAM Model",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we generalize the definition of ""Search Trees"" (ST) to enable
reference values other than the key of prior inserted nodes. The idea builds on
the assumption an $n$-node AVL (or Red-Black) requires to assure $O(\log_2n)$
worst-case search time, namely, a single comparison between two keys takes
constant time. This means the size of each key in bits is fixed to $B=c\log_2
n$ ($c\geq1$) once $n$ is determined, otherwise the $O(1)$-time comparison
assumption does not hold. Based on this we calculate \emph{ideal} reference
values from the mid-point of the interval $0..2^B$. This idea follows
`recursively' to assure each node along the search path is provided a reference
value that guarantees an overall logarithmic time. Because the search tree
property works only when keys are compared to reference values and these values
are calculated only during searches, we term the data structure as the Hidden
Binary Search Tree (HBST). We show elementary functions to maintain the HSBT
height $O(B)=O(\log_2n)$. This result requires no special order on the input --
as does BST -- nor self-balancing procedures, as do AVL and Red-Black.

continuous data. Nevertheless, since the number of model parameters scales
quadratically with the number of variables, these models can be easily
over-parameterized. For this reason, parsimonious models have been developed
via covariance matrix decompositions or assuming local independence. However,
these remedies do not allow for direct estimation of sparse covariance matrices
nor do they take into account that the structure of association among the
variables can vary from one cluster to the other. To this end, we introduce
mixtures of Gaussian covariance graph models for model-based clustering with
sparse covariance matrices. A penalized likelihood approach is employed for
estimation and a general penalty term on the graph configurations can be used
to induce different levels of sparsity and incorporate prior knowledge. Model
estimation is carried out using a structural-EM algorithm for parameters and
graph structure estimation, where two alternative strategies based on a genetic
algorithm and an efficient stepwise search are proposed for inference. With
this approach, sparse component covariance matrices are directly obtained. The
framework results in a parsimonious model-based clustering of the data via a
flexible model for the within-group joint distribution of the variables.
Extensive simulated data experiments and application to illustrative datasets
show that the method attains good classification performance and model quality.

fluorescence (pumping of O III 303.80 A by He II), but none to our knowledge in
X-rays. However, here we report on a scheme where a He-like line of Ne IX at

intensity enhancement in the Ne IX 82.76 A transition under physical conditions
found in solar flare plasmas. A comparison of our theoretical models with
published X-ray observations of a solar flare obtained during a rocket flight

characterized by neo-Hookean model, and the influence of surface energy is
addressed through finite element simulation. Based on dimensional analysis, the
explicit expressions of load-depth relation accounting for film thickness,

the indent depth, while the finite thickness of films tends to decrease the
indent depth, compared to the linear elastic Hertzian solution. More

driving cycles. We find that the geometric distance, $d$, between the reduced
density matrices of non-equilibrium state and steady-state obeys a power-law
scaling of the form $d \sim n^{-B}$, where $n$ is the number of driving cycles
and $B$ is the scaling exponent. The steady-state quantum correlations are
studied as a function of time period of the driving field and are marked by the
presence of prominent peaks in frequency domain. The steady-state features can
be further understood by probing band structures of Floquet Hamiltonian and
purity of the bipartite state between nearest neighbor sites. Finally, we
compare the steady-state values of the local quantum correlations with that of
the canonical Gibbs ensemble and infer about their canonical ergodic
properties. Moreover, we identify generic features in the ergodic properties
depending upon the quantum phases of the initial state and the pathway of
repeated driving that may be within the same quantum phase or across two
different equilibrium phases.

Low-Latency Communication (URLLC). A way to offer URLLC without intervention in
the baseband/PHY layer design is to use interface diversity and integrate
multiple communication interfaces, each interface based on a different
technology. In this work, we propose to use coding to seamlessly distribute
coded payload and redundancy data across multiple available communication
interfaces. We formulate an optimization problem to find the payload allocation
weights that maximize the reliability at specific target latency values. In
order to estimate the performance in terms of latency and reliability of such
an integrated communication system, we propose an analysis framework that
combines traditional reliability models with technology-specific latency
probability distributions. Our model is capable to account for failure
correlation among interfaces/technologies. By considering different scenarios,
we find that optimized strategies can in some cases significantly outperform
strategies based on $k$-out-of-$n$ erasure codes, where the latter do not
account for the characteristics of the different interfaces. The model has been
validated through simulation and is supported by experimental results.

Vibrating sample magnetometry revealed that magnetization at saturation (Ms)
for the Pt and Ir buffered films is higher than the usual Ms of CFA due to the
proximity induced magnetization (PIM) in Ir and Pt, estimated to be 19% and
27%, respectively. The presence of PIM in these materials is confirmed using
x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity. Moreover, while no PIM is induced in W,
higher PIM is obtained with Pt when it is used as buffer layer rather than
capping layer. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) in the Damon-Eshbach geometry
has been used to investigate iDMI constants and the perpendicular anisotropy
field versus the annealing temperature. The DMI sign has been found to be
negative for Pt/CFA and Ir/CFA while it is positive for W/CFA. The thickness
dependence of the effective iDMI constant for stacks involving Pt and W shows
the existence of two regimes similarly to that of the perpendicular anisotropy
constant due to the degradation of the interfaces as the CFA thickness
approaches the nanometer. The surface iDMI and anisotropy constants of each
stack have been determined for the thickest samples where a linear thickness
dependence of the effective iDMI constant and the effective magnetization has
been observed. The interface anisotropy and iDMI constants, investigated for

decrease of iDMI constant with increasing annealing temperature is probably due
to the electronic structure changes at the interfaces, while the increase of
the interface anisotropy constant is coherent the interface quality and

mapping out the parameter space. Crucially, we augment numerical solutions with
asymptotic analysis to better understand the physical controls on the

analyse the associated bifurcation structure. We also determine scalings for
the wavelength and growth rate of the channel structures that emerge. We obtain
quantitative theories for and a physical understanding of: first, how advection

Constituent gamma-ray spectra of a chemical compound have been determined from
its sole spectrum through a forward Monte Carlo simulation coupled with a least
squares method (MCLLS). The method's limitations include its linearity
assumption and its oversensitivity to correlated or noisy data, which render
the method unfit to deal with such numerical ill conditioning. Recently this
issue was tackled by iteratively reducing the condition number of the linear
system of equations. Despite its superior results, it is not suitable for cases
where there are missing libraries in the analysis. Our work introduces a novel
framework that allows treating spectral analyses problems through geometrical

trace direct and reflected acoustic paths using inverse acoustic ray tracing
and utilize these paths with Monte Carlo localization to estimate a 3D sound

microphone array and tested it against different settings with continuous and
intermittent sound signals with a stationary or a mobile source. Across
different settings, our approach can localize the sound with an average

represent spectral features through the sequence of intermediate stages of the

higher sensitivity to EEG amplitude features at later stages. Intriguingly, we
observed a specialization of individual stages of the network to the classical
EEG frequency bands alpha, beta, and high gamma. Furthermore, we find first
evidence that particularly in the last convolutional layer, the network learns
to detect more complex oscillatory patterns beyond spectral phase and
amplitude, reminiscent of the representation of complex visual features in
later layers of ConvNets in computer vision tasks. Our findings thus provide
insights into how ConvNets hierarchically represent spectral EEG features in

Revectorization-based shadow mapping (RBSM) minimizes shadow aliasing by
revectorizing the jagged shadow edges generated with shadow mapping, keeping
low memory footprint and real-time performance for the shadow computation.
However, the current implementation of RBSM is not so well optimized because
its visibility functions are composed of a set of 43 cases, each one of them
handling a specific revectorization scenario and being implemented as a
specific branch in the shader. Here, we take advantage of the shadow shape

meaningful use of visual data in many fields including movement science,
security, and rehabilitation. In this paper we tackle MPPE with a bottom-up
approach, starting with candidate detections of body parts from a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and grouping them into people. We formulate the grouping
of body part detections into people as a minimum-weight set packing (MWSP)
problem where the set of potential people is the power set of body part
detections. We model the quality of a hypothesis of a person which is a set in
the MWSP by an augmented tree-structured Markov random field where variables
correspond to body-parts and their state-spaces correspond to the power set of
the detections for that part.
  We describe a novel algorithm that combines efficiency with provable bounds
on this MWSP problem. We employ an implicit column generation strategy where
the pricing problem is formulated as a dynamic program. To efficiently solve
this dynamic program we exploit the problem structure utilizing a nested
Bender's decomposition (NBD) exact inference strategy which we speed up by
recycling Bender's rows between calls to the pricing problem.
  We test our approach on the MPII-Multiperson dataset, showing that our
approach obtains comparable results with the state-of-the-art algorithm for
joint node labeling and grouping problems, and that NBD achieves considerable
speed-ups relative to a naive dynamic programming approach. Typical algorithms
that solve joint node labeling and grouping problems use heuristics and thus
can not obtain proofs of optimality. Our approach, in contrast, proves that for

of the cluster from redshift $z = 0.5$ (half-mass epoch) to the present. The
cluster A2142 may have formed as a result of past and present mergers and
infallen groups, predominantly along the supercluster axis. Mergers cause
complex radio and X-ray structure of the cluster and affect the properties of
galaxies in the cluster, especially in the infall region. Explaining the

and thus it is able to exploit the inherent non-local self-similarity property
of natural images. As opposed to most of the existing deep network approaches,
which require the training of a specific model for each considered noise level,
the proposed models are able to handle a wide range of noise levels using a
single set of learned parameters, while they are very robust when the noise
degrading the latent image does not match the statistics of the noise used
during training. The latter argument is supported by results that we report on
publicly available images corrupted by unknown noise and which we compare
against solutions obtained by competing methods. At the same time the
introduced networks achieve excellent results under additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN), which are comparable to those of the current state-of-the-art
network, while they depend on a more shallow architecture with the number of
trained parameters being one order of magnitude smaller. These properties make
the proposed networks ideal candidates to serve as sub-solvers on restoration
methods that deal with general inverse imaging problems such as deblurring,
demosaicking, superresolution, etc.

of position estimation using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle. An
additional benefit of these steps is that the time for estimating the position,
and the required data storage are virtually independent of the size of the RoI
and of the total number of available features within the RoI. Thus the proposed
steps facilitate application of FIPS to large areas. Results of an experimental

corroborate the expected performance of the proposed approach. The positioning
accuracy obtained by only processing 10 automatically identified features

automatically identified sub-regions instead of the entire RoI is equivalent to
processing all available data. In the chosen example, 50% of the errors are
less than 1.8 m and 90% are less than 5 m. However, the computation time using
the automatically identified subset of data is only about 1% of that required

places but also for interacting with surrounding environments. While walking to
destinations, pedestrians may acquaint themselves with attractions such as
artworks, shop displays, and public events. If such attractions are tempting
enough, pedestrians opt to stop walking in order to join the attractions. In
crowded conditions, the existence of attractions may considerably affect the
pedestrian flow patterns. One can see that the attracted pedestrians often
impede passerby flow near the attractions during peak hour in a shopping
center. During shopping holidays such as Black Friday in the United States,
shoppers are competing for very attractive products in stores and such behavior
might lead to pedestrian incidents.
  The work presented in this dissertation reproduced those phenomena in

the robust census transform to circumvent the need for ground truth flow. On
the KITTI benchmarks, our unsupervised approach outperforms previous
unsupervised deep networks by a large margin, and is even more accurate than
similar supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets alone. By optionally
fine-tuning on the KITTI training data, our method achieves competitive optical

We extracted the X-ray spectra for various regions inside the CND footprint as
well as for the region where the footprint is observed and for a region located
outside the footprint. We simultaneously fitted these spectra as an optically
thin plasma whose absorption by the interstellar medium and by the local plasma
were fitted independently using the MCMC method. The hydrogen column density of
the ISM is 7.5x10^22 cm^-2. The X-ray diffuse emission inside the CND footprint
is formed by a 2T plasma of 1 and 4keV with slightly super-solar abundances
except for the iron and carbon which are sub-solar. The plasma from the CND, in
turn, is better described by a 1T model with abundances and local hydrogen
column density which are very different to those of the innermost regions. The
large iron abundance in this region confirms that the CND is dominated by the
shock-heated ejecta of the Sgr A East supernova remnant. We deduced that the
CND rather acts as a barrier for the Galactic Centre plasma and that the plasma
located outside the CND may correspond to the collimated outflow possibly

to instrumental sensitivity but instead due to inherent systematic
uncertainties in the instrumentation and data analysis methods. The field of HI
intensity mapping (IM) is still maturing, however early attempts are already
systematics limited. One such systematic limitation is 1/f noise, which largely
originates within the instrumentation and manifests as multiplicative gain
fluctuations. To date there has been little discussion about the possible
impact of 1/f noise on upcoming single-dish HI IM experiments such as BINGO,
FAST or SKA. Presented in this work are Monte-Carlo end-to-end simulations of a
30 day HI IM survey using the SKA-MID array covering a bandwidth of 950 and
1410 MHz. These simulations extend 1/f noise models to include not just
temporal fluctuations but also correlated gain fluctuations across the receiver
bandpass. The power spectral density of the spectral gain fluctuations are
modelled as a power-law, and characterised by a parameter $\beta$. It is found
that the degree of 1/f noise frequency correlation will be critical to the
success of HI IM experiments. Small values of $\beta$ ($\beta$ < 0.25) or high
correlation is preferred as this is more easily removed using current component
separation techniques. The spectral index of temporal fluctuations ($\alpha$)
is also found to have a large impact on signal-to-noise. Telescope slew speed
has a smaller impact, and a scan speed of 1 deg s$^{-1}$ should be sufficient
for a HI IM survey with the SKA.

carried out in terms of the equivalent width of ${\rm H}\alpha$ ($W_{{\rm

where photoionization is dominated by hot, low-mass, evolved stars. Regions
where $W_{{\rm H}\alpha} > 14\ \AA$ trace SF complexes. $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$
values in the intermediate 3--14 $\AA$ range reflect a mixed regime (mDIG)
where more than one process contributes. This three-tier scheme is inspired
both by theoretical and empirical considerations. Its application to CALIFA
galaxies of different types and inclinations leads to the following results:
$\textit{(i)}$ the hDIG component is prevalent throughout ellipticals and S0's
as well as in bulges, and explains the strongly bimodal distribution of
$W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ both among and within galaxies. $\textit{(ii)}$ Early-type
spirals have some hDIG in their discs, but this component becomes progressively
less relevant for later Hubble types. $\textit{(iii)}$ hDIG emission is also
present above and below galactic discs, as seen in several edge-on spirals in
our sample. $\textit{(iv)}$ The SF/mDIG proportion grows steadily from early-
to late-type spirals, and from inner to outer radii. $\textit{(v)}$ Besides
circumventing basic inconsistencies in conventional DIG/SF separation criteria
based on the ${\rm H}\alpha$ surface brightness, our $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$-based
method produces results in agreement with a classical excitation diagram
analysis.

adoption of time derivative of the flux function. To achieve fourth order
accuracy, a finite volume method for GKS using cubic spline reconstruction is

framework based on smaller containers that are packed with simpler rules; while
variations of this scheme are indeed a standard technique in this area, we
abstract away some of the problem-specific differences, obtaining simpler

potential algebras with homogeneous potential of degree $n+1\geq 4$, the
minimal Hilbert series is $H_n=\frac{1}{1-2t+2t^n-t^{n+1}}$, so they are all

series and the Johnson filtration, and that its core part was identified with
the secondary characteristic class $d_1$ associated with the fact that the
first $\mathrm{MMM}$ class vanishes on the Torelli group (however it turned out
that Johnson proved the former part highly likely prior to the above, see
Remark 1.1). This secondary class $d_1$ is a rational generator of
$H^1(\mathcal{K}_g;\mathbb{Z})^{\mathcal{M}_g}\cong\mathbb{Z}$ where
$\mathcal{K}_g$ denotes the Johnson subgroup of the mapping class group
$\mathcal{M}_g$. Hain proved, as a particular case of his fundamental result,
that this is the only difference in degree $2$. In this paper, we prove that no
other invariant than the above gives rise to new rational difference between
the two filtrations up to degree $6$. We apply this to determine
$H_1(\mathcal{K}_g;\mathbb{Q})$ explicitly by computing the description given
by Dimca, Hain and Papadima. We also show that any finite type rational
invariant of homology $3$-spheres of degrees up to $6$, including the second
and the third Ohtsuki invariants, can be expressed by $d_1$ and lifts of
Johnson homomorphisms.

than the one family GUTs like as $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, or $E(6)$ for
classification of all observed quarks and leptons. Any attempt to describe all
three quark-lepton families in the GUT framework leads to higher symmetries
with enormously extended representations which contain lots of exotic states as
well that never been detected in an experiment. This may motivate us to
continue seeking a solution in some subparticle or preon models for quark and
leptons just like as in the nineteen-sixties the spectroscopy of hadrons had
required to seek a solution in the quark model for hadrons. At that time, there
was very popular some concept invoked by Murray Gell-Mann and called the
Eightfold Way according to which all low-lying baryons and mesons are grouped
into octets. We now find that this concept looks much more adequate when it is
applied to elementary preons and composite quarks and leptons. Remarkably, just
the eight left-handed and right-handed preons and their generic metaflavor
symmetry $SU(8)$ may determine the fundamental constituens of material world.
This result for an admissible number of preons, $N=8$, appears as a solution to
the 't Hooft's anomaly matching condition provided that (1) this condition is
satisfied separately for the $L$-preon and $R$-preon composites and (2) these
composites fill only one multiplet of some $SU(N)$ symmetry group rather than a
set of its multiplets. We next show that a partial $L$-$R$ symmetry breaking
reduces an initially emerged vectorlike $SU(8)$ theory down to the conventional
$SU(5)$ GUT with an extra local family symmetry $SU(3)_{F}$ and three standard
generations of quarks and leptons.

investigate the probabilities of producing the late-time acceleration for the

to these cosmological models for chosen series of parameters to see if they
distinguish from one another. The diagnostic involves the statefinder pair
$\{r,s\}$, where $r$ is derived from the scale factor $a$ and its higher
derivatives with respect to the cosmic time $t$, and $s$ is expressed by $r$
and the deceleration parameter $q$. In conclusion, we find that although two
types of $f(R)$ theories: (i) $f(R) = R + \alpha R^m - \beta R^{-n}$ and (ii)
$f(R) = R + \alpha \ln R - \beta$ can lead to late-time acceleration, their
evolutionary trajectories in the $r-s$ and $r-q$ planes reveal different
evolutionary properties, which certainly justify the merits of statefinder
diagnostic. Additionally, we utilize the observational Hubble parameter data
(OHD) to constrain these models of $f(R)$ gravity. As a result, except for
$m=n=1/2$ of (i) case, $\alpha=0$ of (i) case and (ii) case allow $\Lambda$CDM

diagnostic to the best-fit models, we find that all the best-fit models are
capable of going through deceleration/acceleration transition stage with
late-time acceleration epoch, and all these models turn to de-Sitter point
($\{r,s\}=\{1,0\}$) in the future. Also, the evolutionary differences between
these models are distinct, especially in $r-s$ plane, which makes the

E 96, 042306, 2017","10.1103/PhysRevE.96.042306",,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the process of reaching the final state in the coevolving voter
model. There is a coevolution of state dynamics, where a node can copy a state
from a random neighbor with probabilty $1-p$ and link dynamics, where a node
can re-wire its link to another node of the same state with probability $p$.
That exhibits an absorbing transition to a frozen phase above a critical value
of rewiring probability. Our analytical and numerical studies show that in the
active phase mean values of magnetization of nodes $n$ and links $m$ tend to
the same value that depends on initial conditions. In a similar way mean
degrees of spins up and spins down become equal. The system obeys a special
statistical conservation law since a linear combination of both types
magnetizations averaged over many realizations starting from the same initial
conditions is a constant of motion: $\Lambda\equiv (1-p)\mu m(t)+pn(t) =
const$, where $\mu$ is the mean node degree. The final mean magnetization of
nodes and links in the active phase is proportional to $\Lambda$ while the
final density of active links is a square function of $\Lambda$. If the
rewiring probability is above a critical value and the system separates into
disconnected domains, then the values of nodes and links magnetizations are not
the same and final mean degrees of spins up and spins down can be different.

state-space explosion problem is fought by representing sets of states by
first-order formulas over the bit-vector theory. In this model checking
approach, most of the verification time is spent in an SMT solver on deciding
satisfiability of quantified queries, which represent equality of symbolic
states. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for decomposition of symbolic
states, which can be used to significantly improve the performance of any
semi-symbolic model checker. Using the decomposition, a model checker can issue
much simpler and smaller queries to the solver when compared to the original
case. Some SMT calls may be even avoided completely, as the satisfaction of
some of the simplified formulas can be decided syntactically. Moreover, the
decomposition allows for an efficient caching scheme for quantified formulas.

of the accretion of magnetic flux embedded in the matter falling through the

circular-linear (or poly- cylindrical) distribution obtained by combining the
projected and the skew-normal. We show the flexibility of our proposal, its
property of closure under marginalization and how to quantify multivariate
dependence. Due to a non-identifiability issue that our proposal inherits from
the projected normal, a compu- tational problem arises. We overcome it in a
Bayesian framework, adding suitable latent variables and showing that posterior
samples can be obtained with a post-processing of the estimation algo- rithm
output. Under specific prior choices, this approach enables us to implement a
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm relying only on Gibbs steps, where the
updates of the parameters are done as if we were working with a multivariate
normal likelihood. The proposed approach can be also used with the projected
normal. As a proof of concept, on simulated examples we show the ability of our
algorithm in recovering the parameters values and to solve the identification
problem. Then the proposal is used in a real data example, where the
turning-angles (circular variables) and the logarithm of the step-lengths
(linear variables) of four zebras are jointly modelled.

as well as in depth-microhardness and residual stress distribution, and
corrosion resistance were investigated. Successive light surface grinding was
used after severe shot peening to eliminate the effect of surface roughness and
separately investigate the influence of grain refinement alone.
Cytocompatibility tests with osteoblasts (or bone forming cells) were performed
using sample extracts. Results revealed for the first time that severe shot
peening can significantly enhance mechanical properties without causing adverse
effects to the growth of surrounding osteoblasts. The corrosion behavior, on
the other hand, was not improved by severe shot peening; nevertheless, slight
grinding of the rough surface layer with a high density of crystallographic
lattice defects, without removing the entire nanocrystallized layer, provided a
good potential for improving corrosion characteristics after severe shot
peening and thus, this method should be studied for a wide range of orthopedic
