composed of three predictors: team role, personality types, and gender

techniques used for model development were logistic regression, decision tree,

the dynamic regime to the static one. The origin of memory-dependent scaling

(MHD) model in Cartesian coordinates, we carry out numerical simulations to
investigate the evolution of a magnetic system consisting of a flux rope
embedded in a fully-closed quadrupolar magnetic field with different
photospheric flux distributions. It is found that, when the photospheric flux
is not concentrated too much towards the polarity inversion line (PIL) and the
constraint exerted by the background field is not too weak, the equilibrium
states of the system are divided into two branches: the rope sticks to the
photosphere for the lower branch and levitates in the corona for the upper
branch. These two branches are connected by an upward catastrophe (from the
lower branch to the upper) and a downward catastrophe (from the upper branch to
the lower). Our simulations reveal that there exist both upward and downward
catastrophes in quadrupolar fields, which may be either force-free or
non-force-free. The existence and the properties of these two catastrophes are
influenced by the photospheric flux distribution, and a downward catastrophe is
always paired with an upward catastrophe. Comparing the decay indices in
catastrophic and non-catastrophic cases, we infer that torus unstable might be
a necessary but not sufficient condition for a catastrophic system.

scalar bosons, $H$ and $S$, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These two new
bosons are an extension to the Standard Model (SM) and interact with the SM
Higgs boson, $h$. We consider two production modes for $H$, one being gluon
fusion and the other being in association with top quarks. The $H \to S h$
decay mode is considered, where leptonic final states are studied. The CP
properties of $S$ are characterised by considering effective couplings derived
from dimension six operators through $SWW$ vertices. The nature of the $S$
boson is considered in two separate contexts. Firstly in a simplified model, it
is considered to have Higgs-like couplings. Secondly, we consider a heavy
neutrino model and its interactions with the $Z, W$ and $S$ bosons. The
predictions of the models are compared both to ATLAS and CMS results at
$\sqrt{s} = 8$ and $13$~TeV, where appropriate. The data is interpreted using a
simplified model where all the signal comes from $H \to S h$, assuming $S$ to
be Higgs-like, $m_H=270$~GeV and $m_S=150$~GeV. The combined result yields
gives a best fit value for the parameter $\beta_g$ (the strength of the Yukawa
coupling of $H$ to top quarks), $\beta_g^2=1.38\pm 0.22$. A number of regions

sources, dusty galaxies -DSFGs-, thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich -tSZ- distortions
from hot gas, and gravitational lensing) are highly non-Gaussian. Statistics
beyond the power spectrum are therefore potentially important sources of
information about the physics of these processes. We combine data from the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope and with data from the Planck satellite (only using
Planck data in the overlapping region) to constrain the amplitudes of a set of
theoretical bispectrum templates from the tSZ effect, DSFGs, gravitational
lensing, and radio galaxies. We make a strong detection of radio galaxies
(>5$\sigma$) and have hints of non-Gaussianity arising from the tSZ effect,
DSFGs, from cross-correlations between the tSZ effect and DSFGs and from
cross-correlations among the tSZ effect, DSFGs and radio galaxies. These
results suggest that the same halos host radio sources, DSFGs, and have tSZ
signal. We present a new method to calculate the non-Gaussian contributions to
the template covariances. Using this method we find significant non-Gaussian
contributions to the variance and covariance of our templates, with templates
involving the tSZ effect most effected. Strong degeneracies exist between the
various sources at the current noise levels. In light of these degeneracies,
combined with theoretical uncertainty in the templates, these results are a
demonstration of this technique. With these caveats, we demonstrate the utility

engineering, but user-developer perception gaps in requirements understanding
occur frequently. Since user participation in practice is not as active as we
expect and the requirements perception gap has been recognized as a risk that
negatively affects projects, exploring whether user-developer perception gaps
in requirements understanding will hinder user participation is worthwhile.
This will help develop a greater comprehension of the intertwined relationship
between user participation and perception gap, a topic that has not yet been
extensively examined. This study investigates the direct and mediating
influences of user-developer requirements perception gaps on user participation
by integrating requirements uncertainty and top management support. Survey data
collected from 140 subjects were examined and analyzed using structural
equation modeling. The results indicate that perception gaps have a direct
negative effect on user participation and negate completely the positive effect
of top management support on user participation. Additionally, perception gaps
do not have a mediating effect between requirements uncertainty and user
participation because requirements uncertainty does not significantly and
directly affect user participation, but requirements uncertainty indirectly
influences user participation due to its significant direct effect on
perception gaps. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and
limitations and possible future research areas are identified.

(EMG) analysis in SCI, we evaluated the standing quality of paralyzed patients

quantified manually by experienced clinicians. By correlating features of the

We assume the use of a standard compression path, and augment it with a
suitable pre-processing procedure, providing a compressed signal intended to
compensate the degradation without any post-filtering. Our approach originates
from an intricate rate-distortion problem, optimizing the modifications to the
input image/video for reaching best end-to-end performance. We address this

Particularly, we use our method to reduce motion-blur perceived while viewing

without breaking. Furthermore, mechanical deformations lead to the generation
of pseudo-magnetic fields (PMF) that can exceed 300 T. The generated PMF has
opposite direction for electrons originating from different valleys. We show
that valley-polarized currents can be generated by local straining of
multi-terminal graphene devices. The pseudo-magnetic field created by a
Gaussian-like deformation allows electrons from only one valley to transmit and
a current of electrons from a single valley is generated at the opposite side
of the locally strained region. Furthermore, applying a pressure difference
between the two sides of a graphene membrane causes it to bend/bulge resulting
in a resistance change. We find that the resistance changes linearly with
pressure for bubbles of small radius while the response becomes non-linear for
bubbles that stretch almost to the edges of the sample. This is explained as
due to the strong interference of propagating electronic modes inside the
bubble. Our calculations show that high gauge factors can be obtained in this
way which makes graphene a good candidate for pressure sensing.

issue is how to balance convergence, diversity and feasibility simultaneously.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a parameter-free constraint handling
technique, two-archive evolutionary algorithm, for constrained multi-objective
optimization. It maintains two co-evolving populations simultaneously: one,
denoted as convergence archive, is the driving force to push the population
toward the Pareto front; the other one, denoted as diversity archive, mainly
tends to maintain the population diversity. In particular, to complement the
behavior of the convergence archive and provide as much diversified information
as possible, the diversity archive aims at exploring areas under-exploited by
the convergence archive including the infeasible regions. To leverage the
complementary effects of both archives, we develop a restricted mating
selection mechanism that adaptively chooses appropriate mating parents from
them according to their evolution status. Comprehensive experiments on a series
of benchmark problems and a real-world case study fully demonstrate the
competitiveness of our proposed algorithm, comparing to five state-of-the-art
constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimizers.

This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate

introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind
of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with
the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several

less taps, consequently it has less near-common zeros among channels and less
computational complexity. The work proposes three speech-source recovery
methods, namely: i) the multichannel inverse filtering method, i.e. the
multiple input/output inverse theorem (MINT), is exploited in the CTF domain,
and for the multi-source case, ii) a beamforming-like multichannel inverse
filtering method applying single source MINT and using power minimization,
which is suitable whenever the source CTFs are not all known, and iii) a
constrained Lasso method, where the sources are recovered by minimizing the
$\ell_1$-norm to impose their spectral sparsity, with the constraint that the
$\ell_2$-norm fitting cost, between the microphone signals and the mixing model
involving the unknown source signals, is less than a tolerance. The noise can
be reduced by setting a tolerance onto the noise power. Experiments under

the operation of servers (routers or base stations) with sleeping mechanism to
optimize energy-delay tradeoffs. This problem is very challenging when
considering realistic bursty, non-Poisson traffic. We prove for the first time
the optimal structure of such a sleep mechanism for multiple servers when the
arrival of jobs is modeled by a bursty Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP).
It is shown that the optimal operation, which determines the number of active
(or sleeping) servers dynamically, is hysteretic and monotone, and hence it is
a queue-threshold-based policy. This work settles a conjecture in the
literature that the optimal sleeping mechanism for a single server with
interrupted Poisson arrival process, which can be treated as a special case of
MMPP, is queue-threshold-based. The exact thresholds are given by numerically
solving the Markov decision process.

should be allocated to some users. The main goal persuaded in the current work
is finding the best power and sub-channel assignment strategies so that the
associated sum-rate of network is maximized, while a minimum rate constraint is
maintained by each user. The underlying optimization problem is a highly
non-convex mixed integer and non-linear problem which does not yield a trivial
solution. In this regard, to tackle the problem, using an approximate function
which is quite tight at moderate to high signal to interference plus noise
ratio (SINR) region, the problem is divided into two disjoint sub-channel
assignment and power allocation problems. It is shown that having fixed the
allocated power of each user, the subchannel assignment can be thought as a
well-known assignment problem which can be effectively solved using the
so-called Hungarian method. Then, the power allocation is analytically derived.
Furthermore, it is shown that the power can be chosen from two extremal points
of the maximum available power or the minimum power satisfying the rate
constraint. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach over the random selection strategy as well as the method proposed in
[3] which is regarded as the best known method addressed in the literature.

of them working very differently from each other, covering distinct aspects of
the problem and disparate strategies. Despite the large number of existent
techniques, there is no single one which fits well in all cases or for all data
sources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations but
they require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive
to acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, in here, we propose
to combine several very popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment
analysis methods, by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy for
polarity classification. One of our main goals is to reduce the large
variability (lack of stability) of the unsupervised methods across different
domains (datasets). Our solution was thoroughly tested considering thirteen
different datasets in several domains such as opinions, comments, and social
media. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka,
10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, but more
importantly, it solves a key problem in the field. It is consistently among the
best methods in many data types, meaning that it can produce the best (or close
to best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional
costs (e.g., manual labeling). Our self-learning approach is also very
independent of the base methods, which means that it is highly extensible to
incorporate any new additional method that can be envisioned in the future.
Finally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment
analysis as a means to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the
proposed approach and we show the potential of this technique to improve our
results.

approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance
threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a
diminishing repressor. We find that the optimal strategy corresponds to a
nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time. Optimality
arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the extrinsic timing noise of the
regulator, and minimizing the intrinsic timing noise of the target molecule
itself. Although either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated
strategy, when we consider the effects of cell division, we find that
repression outperforms activation if division occurs late in the process. Our
results explain the nonlinear increase and low noise of mig-1 gene expression
in migrating neuroblast cells during Caenorhabditis elegans development, and
suggest that mig-1 regulation is dominated by repression for maximal temporal
precision. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and
powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.

too large to be due to microlensing alone. This is true whether one assumes
knowledge of the luminosity of the supernova or allows the luminosity to be a
free parameter. Varying the dark/stellar ratio likewise doesn't help. In
addition, other macro-models with quadruplicity from external shear or
ellipticity do not significantly improve to model. Finally, microlensing also
makes it difficult to accurately determine the standard candle brightness of
the supernova, as the likelihood plot for the intrinsic magnitude of the source

find that systems with parameters close to the observed one evolve into a state
where consecutive planets are linked by first order resonances and consecutive
triples, apart from planets c, d and e, by connected three body Laplace
resonances. The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean
eccentricities decreasing with time. This evolution is largely driven by tides
acting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. In order
that deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time
scales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the
planets has to be such that $Q' > \sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start
with two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one,
$Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly
exceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the
observed configuration. This scenario is also supported by modelling of the
evolution through disk migration which indicates that the whole system cannot
have migrated inwards together. Also in order to avoid large departures from
commensurabilities, the system cannot have stalled at a disk inner edge for
significant time periods. We discuss the habitability consequences of the tidal
dissipation implied by our modelling, concluding that planets d, e and f are
potentially in habitable zones.

nonlinear loss (two-photon absorption) added to the LL model. Numerical
findings demonstrate that these exact solutions are stable, both dynamically

external magnetic field, time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational
symmetry along the edge are broken spontaneously in a second order phase
transition at a temperature $T^*\approx 0.18 T_c$, where $T_c$ is the
superconducting transition temperature. At the phase transition there is a jump
in the specific heat that scales with the ratio between the edge length $D$ and
layer area ${\cal A}$ as $(D\xi_0/{\cal A})\Delta C_d$, where $\Delta C_d$ is
the jump in the specific heat at the d-wave superconducting transition and
$\xi_0$ is the superconducting coherence length. The phase with broken symmetry
is characterized by a gauge invariant superfluid momentum ${\bf p}_s$ that
forms a non-trivial planar vector field with a chain of sources and sinks along
the edges with a period of approximately $12\xi_0$, and saddle point
disclinations in the interior. To find out the relative importance of
time-reversal and translational symmetry breaking we apply an external field
that breaks time-reversal symmetry explicitly. We find that the phase
transition into the state with the non-trivial ${\bf p}_s$ vector field keeps
its main signatures, and is still of second order. In the external field, the
saddle point disclinations are pushed towards the edges, and thereby a chain of
edge motifs are formed, where each motif contains a source, a sink, and a
saddle point. Due to a competing paramagnetic response at the edges, the phase
transition temperature $T^*$ is slowly suppressed with increasing magnetic
field strength, but the phase with broken symmetry survives into the mixed
state.

that it exhibits a universal extension property: it can be any desired
particular finite set in the right set-theoretic universe and it can become
successively any desired larger finite set in top-extensions of that universe.
Specifically, ZFC proves the set is finite; the definition $\varphi$ has
complexity $\Sigma_2$, so that any affirmative instance of it $\varphi(x)$ is
verified in any sufficiently large rank-initial segment of the universe
$V_\theta$; the set is empty in any transitive model and others; and if

model of set theory can realize a maximal $\Sigma_2$ theory with its natural
number parameters, although this is possible without parameters. Using the
universal finite set, we prove that the validities of top-extensional
set-theoretic potentialism, the modal principles valid in the Kripke model of
all countable models of set theory, each accessing its top-extensions, are
precisely the assertions of S4. Furthermore, if ZFC is consistent, then there

biological threats such as invasive species and cancer metastasis. Expansion is
primarily driven by reproduction and dispersal, but nature abounds with
examples of evolution where organisms pay a reproductive cost to disperse
faster. When does selection favor this 'survival of the fastest?' We searched
for a simple rule, motivated by evolution experiments where swarming bacteria
evolved into an hyperswarmer mutant which disperses $ \sim 100\%$ faster but
pays a growth cost of $\sim 10 \%$ to make many copies of its flagellum. We
analyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this
observation: the population expansion rate ($v$) results from an interplay of
growth ($r$) and dispersal ($D$) and is independent of the carrying capacity:
$v=2\sqrt{rD}$. A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate
($v_2$) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species ($v_1$); this
simple condition ($v_2 > v_1$) determines the maximum cost in slower growth
that a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical
simulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging
bacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay
but do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest. Thus, the expansion
rate defines a traveling wave fitness, which could be combined with trade-offs
to predict evolution of expanding populations.

from the perspective of fine-grained complexity (conditional polynomial lower
bounds). Specifically, we aim to answer why sparse graph problems are so hard,
and why the Longest Common Subsequence problem gets a savings of a factor of
the size of cache times the length of a cache line, but no more. We take the
reductions and techniques from complexity and fine-grained complexity and apply
them to the I/O model to generate new (conditional) lower bounds as well as
faster algorithms. We also prove the existence of a time hierarchy for the I/O
model, which motivates the fine-grained reductions.
  Using fine-grained reductions, we give an algorithm for distinguishing 2 vs.
3 diameter and radius that runs in $O(|E|^2/(MB))$ cache misses, which for
sparse graphs improves over the previous $O(|V|^2/B)$ running time. We give new
reductions from radius and diameter to Wiener index and median. We show
meaningful reductions between problems that have linear-time solutions in the
RAM model. The reductions use low I/O complexity (typically $O(n/B)$), and thus
help to finely capture the relationship between ""I/O linear time"" $\Theta(n/B)$
and RAM linear time $\Theta(n)$. We generate new I/O assumptions based on the
difficulty of improving sparse graph problem running times in the I/O model. We
create conjectures that the current best known algorithms for Single Source
Shortest Paths (SSSP), diameter, and radius are optimal. From these I/O-model
assumptions, we show that many of the known reductions in the word-RAM model
can naturally extend to hold in the I/O model as well (e.g., a lower bound on
the I/O complexity of Longest Common Subsequence that matches the best known
running time). Finally, we prove an analog of the Time Hierarchy Theorem in the
I/O model.

of magnitude. Sending probes with inscribed matter requires less energy, but

the UFO in the well-studied Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4151. We find that the UFO can
be accelerated along magnetic streamlines anchored in the accretion disk. In

proposed the use of deep convolutional neural networks for the detection and

non-stationary non-Gaussian noise, with minimal resources, and also enables the
detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed

the dominant decay channel is mostly $H^{\pm}\rightarrow tb$ such that ${\rm

In this context, the decay patterns of the charged Higgs can play a significant
role to distinguish among the SUSY models. In addition to the $tb$ decay mode,
we find that the narrow mass scale in CMSSM allows only the decay modes for the
charged Higgs boson to $\tau\nu$ ($\sim 16\%$), and their supersymmetric
partners $\tilde{\tau}\tilde{\nu}$ ($\sim 13\%$). On the other hand, it is
possible to realize the mode in NMSSM and UMSSM in which the charged Higgs
boson decays into a chargino and neutralino pair up to about $25\%$. {This
decay mode requires non-universal boundary conditions within the MSSM framework

stellar temperature, exemplified by a sharp increase in rotation near the M$4$
transition to fully convective stellar interiors, which is consistent with the
hypothesis that fully convective stars are unable to shed angular momentum as

the results are broadly consistent, the photometric surveys exhibit a smaller
fraction of rotators beyond the M$4$ transition by a factor of $\sim 2$. We
discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. Given our detection limit, our
results are consistent with a bi-modal distribution in rotation that is seen in

measurement with previous observations in the ultraviolet shows that the
chromosphere is co-rotating with the star up to a radius of ~10 au (45 mas or
1.5x the ALMA continuum radius). The coincidence of the position angle of the
polar axis of Betelgeuse with that of the major ALMA continuum hot spot, a

if the curvature is measured to be at the value of the amplitude of the CMB
fluctuations, it would offer a powerful test on the inflationary paradigm and
would indicate that our Universe must be significantly larger than the current

value above CMB fluctuations will lead us to conclude that the Universe is not
much larger than the current observed horizon, this can also be interpreted as
the presence of large fluctuations outside the horizon. However, it has proven
difficult, so far, to find observables that can achieve such level of accuracy,

halos and typically grow significantly in mass until $z = 0$, where they span

massive (Mstar~3e11 Msun) early-type galaxies and its dependence on redshift,
specifically in the range 0<z<1. We start from a large sample of SDSS
early-type galaxies with stellar masses and effective radii measured assuming
two different profiles, de Vaucouleurs and S\'{e}rsic. We assign dark matter
haloes to galaxies via abundance matching relations with standard LCDM profiles
and concentrations. We then compute the total, mass-weighted density slope at
the effective radius gamma', and study its redshift dependence at fixed stellar
mass. We find that a necessary condition to induce an increasingly flatter
gamma' at higher redshifts, as suggested by current strong lensing data, is to
allow the intrinsic stellar profile of massive galaxies to be S\'{e}rsic and
the input S\'{e}rsic index n to vary with redshift approximately as
n(z)~(1+z)^(-1). This conclusion holds irrespective of the input Mstar-Mhalo
relation, the assumed stellar initial mass function, or even the chosen level
of adiabatic contraction in the model. Secondary contributors to the observed
redshift evolution of gamma' may come from an increased contribution at higher
redshifts of adiabatic contraction and/or bottom-light stellar initial mass
functions. The strong lensing selection effects we have simulated seem not to
contribute to this effect. A steadily increasing S\'{e}rsic index with cosmic
time is supported by independent observations, though it is not yet clear
whether cosmological hierarchical models (e.g., mergers) are capable of
reproducing such a fast and sharp evolution.

populations, dynamical equivalence of stellar-dynamical systems has been
postulated by Kroupa and Belloni et al. to allow mapping of solutions of the
initial conditions of embedded clusters such that they yield, after a period of
dynamical processing, the Galactic field population. Dynamically equivalent
systems are defined to initially and finally have the same distribution
functions of periods, mass ratios and eccentricities of binary stars. Here we
search for dynamically equivalent clusters using the {\sc mocca} code. The
simulations confirm that dynamically equivalent solutions indeed exist. The
result is that the solution space is next to identical to the radius--mass
relation of Marks \& Kroupa, $\left( r_h/{\rm pc} \right)=
0.1^{+0.07}_{-0.04}\, \left( M_{\rm ecl}/{\rm M}_\odot \right)^{0.13\pm0.04}$.
This relation is in good agreement with the observed density of molecular cloud
clumps. According to the solutions, the time-scale to reach dynamical
equivalence is about 0.5~Myr which is, interestingly, consistent with the
lifetime of ultra-compact HII regions and the time-scale needed for gas
expulsion to be active in observed very young clusters as based on their
dynamical modelling.

of fundamental and technological importance. For example, the simultaneous

to enhanced functionalities. In high-temperature superconductors, intertwining
between charge- and spin-order can form superconducting states at high
transition temperatures. However, pinning down the microscopic mechanisms
responsible for the simultaneous presence of different orders is difficult,
making it hard to predict the phenomenology of a material or to experimentally

scenarios of competition, coexistence and coupling between them. In the latter
case, intriguingly, the presence of one order lowers the critical point of the
other. Our system is realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate which can undergo
self-organization phase transitions in two optical resonators, resulting in two
distinct crystalline density orders. We characterize the intertwining between
these orders by measuring the composite order parameter and the elementary

Line Energy Distribution (SLED) as resulting mainly from Herschel and ALMA

suggests the presence of a heavily obscured AGN with an intrinsic luminosity of
L$_{\rm{1-100\,keV}} \simeq 4.0\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. ALMA high
resolution data ($\theta \simeq 0.2''$) allows us to scan the nuclear region
down to a spatial scale of $\approx 100$ pc for the CO(6-5) transition. We
model the observed SLED using Photo-Dissociation Region (PDR), X-ray-Dominated
Region (XDR), and shock models, finding that a combination of a PDR and an XDR
provides the best fit to the observations. The PDR component, characterized by
gas density ${\rm log}(n/{\rm cm^{-3}})=2.5$ and temperature $T=30$ K,
reproduces the low-J CO line luminosities. The XDR is instead characterised by
a denser and warmer gas (${\rm log}(n/{\rm cm^{-3}})=4.5$, $T =65$ K), and is
necessary to fit the high-J transitions. The addition of a third component to
account for the presence of shocks has been also tested but does not improve

the memory accesses of cryptographic operations to follow a uniform key

thereby invalidates the assumption that microarchitectural side-channel

investigate the Riemannian geometry of these generated manifolds. First, we
develop efficient algorithms for computing geodesic curves, which provide an
intrinsic notion of distance between points on the manifold. Second, we develop
an algorithm for parallel translation of a tangent vector along a path on the
manifold. We show how parallel translation can be used to generate analogies,
i.e., to transport a change in one data point into a semantically similar
change of another data point. Our experiments on real image data show that the
manifolds learned by deep generative models, while nonlinear, are surprisingly
close to zero curvature. The practical implication is that linear paths in the
latent space closely approximate geodesics on the generated manifold. However,
further investigation into this phenomenon is warranted, to identify if there
are other architectures or datasets where curvature plays a more prominent

optimization task through iteratively solving a sequence of (much easier) local
optimization tasks on different parts (or blocks) of the input parameters.
While popular and widely applicable, very few examples of this heuristic are
rigorously shown to converge to optimality, and even fewer to do so
efficiently.
  In this paper we present a general framework which is amenable to rigorous
analysis, and expose its applicability. Its main feature is that the local
optimization domains are each a group of invertible matrices, together
naturally acting on tensors, and the optimization problem is minimizing the
norm of an input tensor under this joint action. The solution of this
optimization problem captures a basic problem in Invariant Theory, called the
null-cone problem.
  This algebraic framework turns out to encompass natural computational
problems in combinatorial optimization, algebra, analysis, quantum information
theory, and geometric complexity theory. It includes and extends to high
dimensions the recent advances on (2-dimensional) operator scaling.
  Our main result is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this
general problem, which may be viewed as a multi-dimensional scaling algorithm.
This directly leads to progress on some of the problems in the areas above, and
a unified view of others. We explain how faster convergence of an algorithm for
the same problem will allow resolving central open problems.
  Our main techniques come from Invariant Theory, and include its rich
non-commutative duality theory, and new bounds on the bitsizes of coefficients
of invariant polynomials. They enrich the algorithmic toolbox of this very
computational field of mathematics, and are directly related to some challenges

collection of $m$ sets, and the goal is to find the smallest sub-collection of

time $O(mn2^n)$ [Fomin et al., WG 2004], and the Set Cover Conjecture (SeCoCo)
[Cygan et al., TALG 2016] asserts that for every fixed $\varepsilon>0$, no
algorithm can solve Set Cover in time $2^{(1-\varepsilon)n}poly(m)$, even if
set sizes are bounded by $\Delta=\Delta(\varepsilon)$. We show strong
connections between this problem and kTree, a special case of Subgraph
Isomorphism where the input is an $n$-node graph $G$ and a $k$-node tree $T$,
and the goal is to determine whether $G$ has a subgraph isomorphic to $T$.
  First, we propose a weaker conjecture Log-SeCoCo, that allows input sets of
size $\Delta=O(1/\varepsilon \cdot\log n)$, and show that an algorithm breaking
Log-SeCoCo would imply a faster algorithm than the currently known $2^n
poly(n)$-time algorithm [Koutis and Williams, TALG 2016] for Directed nTree,
which is kTree with $k=n$ and arbitrary directions to the edges of $G$ and $T$.
This would also improve the running time for Directed Hamiltonicity, for which
no algorithm significantly faster than $2^n poly(n)$ is known despite extensive
research.
  Second, we prove that if Set Cover cannot be solved significantly faster than
$2^npoly(m)$ (an assumption even weaker than Log-SeCoCo), then kTree cannot be
computed significantly faster than $2^kpoly(n)$, the running time of the Koutis
and Williams' algorithm. Applying the same techniques to the p-Partial Cover
problem, a parameterized version of Set Cover that requires covering at least
$p$ elements, we obtain a new algorithm with running time $(2+\varepsilon)^p
(m+n)^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ for arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$, which improves
previous work and is nearly optimal assuming say Log-SeCoCo.

accelerators on the Earth. Relativistic electrons accelerated by electric
fields therein emit bremsstrahlung gamma rays, which have been detected at
ground observations, by airborne detectors, and as terrestrial gamma-ray
flashes (TGFs) from space. The energy of the gamma rays is sufficiently high to
potentially invoke atmospheric photonuclear reactions 14N(gamma, n)13N, which
would produce neutrons and eventually positrons via beta-plus decay of
generated unstable radioactive isotopes, especially 13N. However, no clear
observational evidence for the reaction has been reported to date. Here we
report the first detection of neutron and positron signals from lightning with
a ground observation. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a
TGF-like intense flash (within 1 ms) was detected at our monitoring sites
0.5-1.7 km away from the lightning. The subsequent initial burst quickly
subsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a
prolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a
minute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the
initial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the
nuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line
emission corresponds to the electron-positron annihilation, and hence is the
conclusive indication of positrons produced after the lightning. Our detection
of neutrons and positrons is unequivocal evidence that natural lightning
triggers photonuclear reactions. No other natural event on the Earth is known
to trigger photonuclear reactions. This discovery places lightning as only the

colour bimodality distribution, indicating the presence of ""blue"" and ""red"" GC

surface density profile, suggesting a significant accretion of low-mass
satellites in the outer halo of the galaxy. In addition, the slope of the
projected spatial distribution of the blue GCs in the outer regions of the
galaxy, is similar to that of the X-ray halo emission. Integrating up to 165
kpc the profile of the projected spatial distribution of the GCs, we estimated
a total GC population and specific frequency of 6000$\pm$1100 and
$S_N$=7.4$\pm$1.4, respectively. Regarding NGC 1395 itself, the analysis of the
deep Gemini/GMOS images shows a low surface brightness umbrella-like structure

hypothetical storm is largely dependent on the radio spectral roll-off, $n$,
and the flash duration, $\tau_\mathrm{fl}$. The best-case scenario would
require a flash density of the same order of magnitude as can be found during
volcanic eruptions on Earth. On average, $3.8 \times 10^6$ times larger flash

cells are generated from progenitors in the subgranular zone and integrate in a
typical fashion. During the development of epilepsy, granule cell integration
is profoundly altered. The new cells migrate to ectopic locations and develop
misoriented basal dendrites. Although it has been established that these
abnormal cells are newly generated, it is not known whether they arise
ubiquitously throughout the progenitor cell pool or are derived from a smaller

majority of ectopic cells following status epilepticus, indicating that either
the affected progenitors or their local microenvironments have become
pathological. By contrast, granule cells with basal dendrites were equally

non-contextual quantum mechanics can be simulated efficiently by classical
computers in many cases. Orders of Planck's constant, $\hbar$, can also be used
to characterize the classical-quantum divide by expanding quantities of
interest in powers of $\hbar$---all orders higher than $\hbar^0$ can be
interpreted as quantum corrections to the order $\hbar^0$ term. We show that
contextual measurements in finite-dimensional systems have formulations within
the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal (WWM) formalism that require higher than order $\hbar^0$
terms to be included in order to violate the classical bounds on their
expectation values. As a result, we show that contextuality as a resource is
equivalent to orders of $\hbar$ as a resource within the WWM formalism. This
explains why qubits can only exhibit state-independent contextuality under
Pauli observables as in the Peres-Mermin square while odd-dimensional qudits
can also exhibit state-dependent contextuality. In particular, we find that
qubit Pauli observables lack an order $\hbar^0$ contribution in their Weyl
symbol and so exhibit contextuality regardless of the state being measured. On
the other hand, odd-dimensional qudit observables generally possess non-zero
order $\hbar^0$ terms, and higher, in their WWM formulation, and so exhibit
contextuality depending on the state measured: odd-dimensional qudit states
that exhibit measurement contextuality have an order $\hbar^1$ contribution
that allows for the violation of classical bounds while states that do not
exhibit measurement contextuality have insufficiently large order $\hbar^1$
contributions.

without trampling the privacy afforded to users by end-to-end encryption, our
threat detection model needs to evolve from signature based detection to a
heuristic model that flags deviations from normal network-wide behavior for
further investigation. In this paper we present such a heuristic model and test
its effectiveness for detecting intrusions in an entirely encrypted network
environment. Our results demonstrate the network intrusion detection system's
ability to monitor a network carrying only host-to-host encrypted traffic. This
work indicates that a broad perspective change is required. Network security
models need to evolve from endeavoring to define attack signatures to
describing what the network looks like under normal conditions and searching
for deviations from the norm.

covariances and this feature is important to take into account for statistical
models that attempt to emulate the physical process. A convolution-based model
is used to represent non-stationary Gaussian processes that allows for
variation in the correlation range and vari- ance of the process across space.
Application of this model has two steps: windowed estimates of the covariance
function under the as- sumption of local stationary and encoding the local
estimates into a single spatial process model that allows for efficient
simulation. Specifically we give evidence to show that non-stationary
covariance functions based on the Mat`ern family can be reproduced by the Lat-
ticeKrig model, a flexible, multi-resolution representation of Gaussian
processes. We propose to fit locally stationary models based on the Mat`ern
covariance and then assemble these estimates into a single, global LatticeKrig
model. One advantage of the LatticeKrig model is that it is efficient for
simulating non-stationary fields even at 105 locations. This work is motivated
by the interest in emulating spatial fields derived from numerical model
simulations such as Earth system models. We successfully apply these ideas to
emulate fields that de- scribe the uncertainty in the pattern scaling of mean
summer (JJA) surface temperature from a series of climate model experiments.
This example is significant because it emulates tens of thousands of loca-
tions, typical in geophysical model fields, and leverages embarrassing parallel
computation to speed up the local covariance fitting

mechanistic description of biochemical processes. If parameters are inferred
from experimental data, such mechanistic models can provide accurate
predictions about the behavior of latent variables or the process under new
experimental conditions. Complementarily, inference of model structure can be
used to identify the most plausible model structure from a set of candidates,
and thus gain novel biological insight. Several toolboxes can infer model
parameters and structure for small- to medium-scale mechanistic models out of
the box. However, models for highly multiplexed datasets can require hundreds
to thousands of state variables and parameters. For the analysis of such
large-scale models, most algorithms require intractably high computation times.
This chapter provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods for parameter and

concept in computational game theory, largely inspired by practical problems
such as security settings. In practice, however, there is typically uncertainty
regarding the model about the opponent. This paper is, to our knowledge, the
first to investigate Stackelberg equilibria under uncertainty in extensive-form
games, one of the broadest classes of game. We introduce robust Stackelberg
equilibria, where the uncertainty is about the opponent's payoffs, as well as
ones where the opponent has limited lookahead and the uncertainty is about the
opponent's node evaluation function. We develop a new mixed-integer program for
the deterministic limited-lookahead setting. We then extend the program to the
robust setting for Stackelberg equilibrium under unlimited and under limited
lookahead by the opponent. We show that for the specific case of interval
uncertainty about the opponent's payoffs (or about the opponent's node
evaluations in the case of limited lookahead), robust Stackelberg equilibria
can be computed with a mixed-integer program that is of the same asymptotic
size as that for the deterministic setting.

particle-laden flows may degrade when the particle and fluid momentum equations
are two-way coupled. In these cases the fluid velocity at the location of the
particle, which is often used as an estimation of the undisturbed velocity, is
altered by the presence of the particle, modifying the slip velocity and
producing an erroneous prediction of coupling forces between fluid and
particle. In this article, we propose a correction scheme to eliminate this
error and predict the undisturbed fluid velocity accurately. Conceptually, in
this method, the computation cell is treated as a solid object immersed in the
fluid that is subjected to the two-way coupling force and dragged at a velocity
that is identical to the disturbance created by the particle. The proposed
scheme is generic as it can be applied to unstructured grids with arbitrary
geometry and particles that have different size and density. At its crudest
form for isotropic grids, the present correction scheme reduces to dividing the
Stokes drag by $1 - 0.75\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is the ratio of the particle
diameter to the grid size. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is evaluated by
comparing the computed settling velocity of individual and pair of particles
under gravity on anisotropic rectilinear grids against analytical solutions.
This comparison shows up to two orders of magnitude reduction in error in cases
where the particle is up to 5 times larger than the grid that may have an
aspect ratio of over 10. Furthermore, a comparison against the
particle-resolved simulation of decaying turbulence demonstrates the excellent
accuracy of the proposed scheme.

genomic data that are high dimensional and sparse? Furthermore, how can we
incorporate prior knowledge, such as the association between genes, in the
analysis systematically? Method: To solve this problem, we propose a Scalable
Network Constrained Tucker decomposition method we call SNeCT. SNeCT adopts
parallel stochastic gradient descent approach on the proposed parallelizable
network constrained optimization function. SNeCT decomposition is applied to
tensor constructed from large scale multi-platform multi-cohort cancer data,
PanCan12, constrained on a network built from PathwayCommons database. Results:
The decomposed factor matrices are applied to stratify cancers, to search for
top-k similar patients, and to illustrate how the matrices can be used for
personalized interpretation. In the stratification test, combined twelve-cohort
data is clustered to form thirteen subclasses. The thirteen subclasses have a
high correlation to tissue of origin in addition to other interesting
observations, such as clear separation of OV cancers to two groups, and high
clinical correlation within subclusters formed in cohorts BRCA and UCEC. In the
top-k search, a new patient's genomic profile is generated and searched against
existing patients based on the factor matrices. The similarity of the top-k
patient to the query is high for 23 clinical features, including
estrogen/progesterone receptor statuses of BRCA patients with average precision
value ranges from 0.72 to 0.86 and from 0.68 to 0.86, respectively. We also
provide an illustration of how the factor matrices can be used for
interpretable personalized analysis of each patient.

coordinate visual-audio feature fusion effectively and achieve the state-of-art

  Generation","Have some problems need to be handled",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual and audio modalities are two symbiotic modalities underlying videos,
which contain both common and complementary information. If they can be mined
and fused sufficiently, performances of related video tasks can be
significantly enhanced. However, due to the environmental interference or
sensor fault, sometimes, only one modality exists while the other is abandoned
or missing. By recovering the missing modality from the existing one based on
the common information shared between them and the prior information of the
specific modality, great bonus will be gained for various vision tasks. In this
paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CMCGAN)
to handle cross-modal visual-audio mutual generation. Specifically, CMCGAN is
composed of four kinds of subnetworks: audio-to-visual, visual-to-audio,
audio-to-audio and visual-to-visual subnetworks respectively, which are
organized in a cycle architecture. CMCGAN has several remarkable advantages.
Firstly, CMCGAN unifies visual-audio mutual generation into a common framework
by a joint corresponding adversarial loss. Secondly, through introducing a
latent vector with Gaussian distribution, CMCGAN can handle dimension and
structure asymmetry over visual and audio modalities effectively. Thirdly,
CMCGAN can be trained end-to-end to achieve better convenience. Benefiting from
CMCGAN, we develop a dynamic multimodal classification network to handle the
modality missing problem. Abundant experiments have been conducted and validate
that CMCGAN obtains the state-of-the-art cross-modal visual-audio generation
results. Furthermore, it is shown that the generated modality achieves
comparable effects with those of original modality, which demonstrates the
effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.

(1887-1986) show surface protrusions of varying width, up to several hundreds
of microns. These protrusions are similar to those described in the art
conservation literature as metallic soaps. Since the presence of these
protrusions raises questions about the state of conservation and long-term
prospects for deterioration of these artworks, a 3D-imaging technique,
photometric stereo using ultraviolet illumination, was developed for the
long-term monitoring of the surface-shape of the protrusions and the
surrounding paint. Because the UV fluorescence response of painting materials
is isotropic, errors typically caused by non-Lambertian (anisotropic)
specularities when using visible reflected light can be avoided providing a
more accurate estimation of shape. As an added benefit, fluorescence provides
additional contrast information contributing to materials characterization. The
developed methodology aims to detect, characterize, and quantify the
distribution of micro-protrusions and their development over the surface of
entire artworks. Combined with a set of analytical in-situ techniques, and
computational tools, this approach constitutes a novel methodology to
investigate the selective distribution of protrusions in correlation with the
composition of painting materials at the macro-scale. While focused on
O'Keeffe's paintings as a case study, we expect the proposed approach to have
broader significance by providing a non-invasive protocol to the conservation
community to probe topological changes for any relatively flat painted surface
of an artwork, and more specifically to monitor the dynamic formation of
protrusions, in relation to paint composition and modifications of
environmental conditions, loans, exhibitions and storage over the long-term.

model represents within its weights all of the information required to answer
any question about any image. Learning this information from any real training
set seems unlikely, and representing it in a reasonable number of weights
doubly so. We propose instead to approach VQA as a meta learning task, thus
separating the question answering method from the information required. At test
time, the method is provided with a support set of example questions/answers,
over which it reasons to resolve the given question. The support set is not
fixed and can be extended without retraining, thereby expanding the
capabilities of the model. To exploit this dynamically provided information, we
adapt a state-of-the-art VQA model with two techniques from the recent meta
learning literature, namely prototypical networks and meta networks.
Experiments demonstrate the capability of the system to learn to produce
completely novel answers (i.e. never seen during training) from examples
provided at test time. In comparison to the existing state of the art, the
proposed method produces qualitatively distinct results with higher recall of
rare answers, and a better sample efficiency that allows training with little
initial data. More importantly, it represents an important step towards
vision-and-language methods that can learn and reason on-the-fly.

attempt to learn a joint embedding space where images from different domains

Importantly, mid-level features already exist in earlier layers of the DNN.
They just need to be extracted, represented, and fused properly with the final
layer. Based on this simple but powerful idea, we propose a unified framework
for CDIM. Instantiating our framework for FG-SBIR and ReID, we show that our
simple models can easily beat the state-of-the-art models, which are often

static analysis. Current practice is to continuously fuzz and sanitize internal
pre-release builds. Sanitization-enabled builds are rarely released publicly.
This is in large part due to the high memory and processing requirements of
sanitizers.
  We present PartiSan, a run-time partitioning technique that speeds up
sanitizers and allows them to be used in a more flexible manner. Our core idea
is to partition the execution into sanitized slices that incur a run-time
overhead, and unsanitized slices running at full speed. With PartiSan,
sanitization is no longer an all-or-nothing proposition. A single build can be
distributed to every user regardless of their willingness to enable
sanitization and the capabilities of their host system. PartiSan can
automatically adjust the amount of sanitization to fit within a performance
budget or disable sanitization if the host lacks sufficient resources. The
flexibility afforded by run-time partitioning also means that we can alternate
between different types of sanitizers dynamically; today, developers have to
pick a single type of sanitizer ahead of time. Finally, we show that run-time
partitioning can speed up fuzzing by running the sanitized partition only when
the fuzzer discovers an input that causes a crash or uncovers new execution
paths.

density-dependent chemotactic sensitivity, and we provide a more realistic
description of cell migration process for its early and late stages. Different
from the existing studies focusing on the case of non-degenerate diffusion, the
new model with degenerate diffusion causes us some essential difficulty on the
boundedness estimates and the propagation behavior of its compact support. In
the presence of logistic damping, for the early stage before tumour cells
spread to the whole body, we first estimate the expanding speed of tumour
region as $O(t^{\beta})$ for $0<\beta<\frac{1}{2}$. Then, for the late stage of
cell migration, we further prove that the asymptotic profile of the original
system is just its corresponding steady state. The global convergence of the
original weak solution to the steady state with exponential rate $O(e^{-ct})$
for some $c>0$ is also obtained.

to reduce the initial user waiting time and client side buffer requirement at

augmentation is required to the basic FB scheme as it lacks any mechanism to
realise a well defined relationship among the segment sizes at channel

However, the theoretical neutrino-nucleon interaction cross section rises with
energy such that, at energies above 40 TeV, neutrinos are expected to be
absorbed as they pass through the Earth. Experimentally, the cross section has
been measured only at the relatively low energies (below 400 GeV) available at
neutrino beams from accelerators \cite{Agashe:2014kda, Formaggio:2013kya}. Here
we report the first measurement of neutrino absorption in the Earth, using a
sample of 10,784 energetic upward-going neutrino-induced muons observed with
the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The flux of high-energy neutrinos transiting
long paths through the Earth is attenuated compared to a reference sample that
follows shorter trajectories through the Earth. Using a fit to the
two-dimensional distribution of muon energy and zenith angle, we determine the
cross section for neutrino energies between 6.3 TeV and 980 TeV, more than an
order of magnitude higher in energy than previous measurements. The measured
cross section is $1.30^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$ (stat.) $^{+0.39}_{-0.43}$ (syst.)
times the prediction of the Standard Model \cite{CooperSarkar:2011pa},
consistent with the expectation for charged and neutral current interactions.
We do not observe a dramatic increase in the cross section, expected in some
speculative models, including those invoking new compact dimensions
\cite{AlvarezMuniz:2002ga} or the production of leptoquarks
\cite{Romero:2009vu}.

understanding of the AGN unified model. We present a sample of 21 new CL AGNs
at $0.08<z<0.58$, which doubles the number of such objects known to date. These
new CL AGNs were discovered by several ways, from (1) repeat spectra in the
SDSS, (2) repeat spectra in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) and SDSS, and (3) photometric variability and new
spectroscopic observations. We use the photometric data from surveys, including
the SDSS imaging survey, the Pan-STARRS1, the DESI Legacy imaging survey, the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Catalina Real-time Transient
Survey, and the Palomar Transient Factory. The estimated upper limits of
transition timescale of the CL AGNs in this sample spans from 0.9 to 13 years
in the rest frame. The continuum flux in the optical and mid-infrared becomes
brighter when the CL AGNs turn on, or vice versa. Variations of more than 0.2
mag in $W1$ band were detected in 15 CL AGNs during the transition. The optical
and mid-infrared variability is not consistent with the scenario of variable
obscuration in 10 CL AGNs at more than $3\sigma$ confidence level. We confirm a
bluer-when-brighter trend in the optical. However, the mid-infrared WISE colors
$W1-W2$ become redder when the objects become brighter in the $W1$ band,
possibly due to a stronger hot dust contribution in the $W2$ band when the AGN
activity becomes stronger. The physical mechanism of type transition is
important for understanding the evolution of AGNs.

spectra of 13 gravitationally lensed quasars with image separation angles of a
few arcseconds, which correspond to 100 pc to 10 kpc in physical distances.
After separating metal absorption lines detected in the spectra into high-ions
with ionization parameter (IP) $>$ 40 eV and low-ions with IP $<$ 20 eV, we
find that i) the fraction of absorption lines that are detected in only one of
the lensed images is larger for low-ions ($\sim$16%) than high-ions ($\sim$2%),
ii) the fractional difference of equivalent widths ($EW$s) between the lensed
images is almost same (${\rm d}EW$ $\sim$ 0.2) for both groups although the
low-ions have a slightly larger variation, and iii) weak low-ion absorbers tend
to have larger ${\rm d}EW$ compared to weak high-ion absorbers. We construct
simple models to reproduce these observed properties and investigate the
distribution of physical quantities such as size and location of absorbers,
using some free parameters. Our best models for absorbers with high-ions and
low-ions suggest that i) an overall size of the CGM is at least $\sim$ 500 kpc,
ii) a size of spherical clumpy cloud is $\sim$ 1 kpc or smaller, and iii) only
high-ion absorbers can have diffusely distributed homogeneous component
throughout the CGM. We infer that a high ionization absorber distributes almost
homogeneously with a small-scale internal fluctuation, while a low ionization
absorber consists of a large number of small-scale clouds in the diffusely
distributed higher ionized region. This is the first result to investigate the
internal small-scale structure of the CGM, based on the large number of

aligned signals are then decoded into noiseless integer combinations of
messages, also known as network-coded messages, by physical-layer network
coding. The key idea of our scheme is to ensure that independent integer

processor can recover the original messages of the transmitters by solving the
linearly independent equations. We prove that our SNC scheme achieves full

from efficient utilization of the signal subspaces for conveying independent
linear equations of messages to the central processor.

  Sharp features including edges and corners can not be well preserved in most

  However, these two methods have suffered producing staircase artifacts in

  The proposed model can preserve sharp features and simultaneously suppress

(ISS) and 15 GHz intrinsic variability of compact, radio-selected AGNs drawn

discover that the strongest scintillators at 5 GHz (modulation index, $m_5 \geq
0.02$) all exhibit strong 15 GHz intrinsic variability ($m_{15} \geq 0.1$).
This relationship can be attributed mainly to the mutual dependence of
intrinsic variability and ISS amplitudes on radio core compactness at $\sim
100\, \mu$as scales, and to a lesser extent, on their mutual dependences on
source flux density, arcsec-scale core dominance and redshift. However, not all
sources displaying strong intrinsic variations show high amplitude
scintillation, since ISS is also strongly dependent on Galactic line-of-sight
scattering properties. This observed relationship between intrinsic variability
and ISS highlights the importance of optimizing the observing frequency,
cadence, timespan and sky coverage of future radio variability surveys, such
that these two effects can be better distinguished to study the underlying
physics. For the full MASIV sample, we find that Fermi-detected gamma-ray loud
sources exhibit significantly higher 5 GHz ISS amplitudes than gamma-ray quiet
sources. This relationship is weaker than the known correlation between
gamma-ray loudness and the 15 GHz variability amplitudes, most likely due to
jet opacity effects.

pilot transmission scheme and assess its performance, specifically the ergodic
sum-rate. The proposed scheme -- the simultaneous pilot transmission (SPT) --
enables to reduce pilot overhead, where the pilot overhead depends on the
number of antennas at the base station (BS), since the self-interference
channel has to be estimated. We consider two multicell scenarios-- cooperative
and non-cooperative multicell systems--, and derive the analytic model of the
ergodic achievable sum-rate for cell-boundary users. The model is derived by
applying a simple linear filter, i.e., matched filter or zero-forcing filter,
to the BS. In the analytic model, we also consider large-scale fading, pilot
contamination, transmitter noise and receiver distortion. Exploiting the
derived analytic model, the feasibility of full-duplex large-scale MIMO systems
is shown with respect to system parameters. In the end, we confirm that our
analytic model matches well the numerical results and the SPT has advantages

often face the problem of multiple testing based on discrete test statistics,
aimed at controlling family-wise error rate (FWER). Most existing FWER
controlling procedures are developed for continuous data, which are often
conservative when analyzing discrete data. By using minimal attainable
$p$-values, several FWER controlling procedures have been specifically
developed for discrete data in the literature. In this paper, by utilizing
known marginal distributions of true null $p$-values, three more powerful
stepwise procedures are developed, which are modified versions of the
conventional Bonferroni, Holm and Hochberg procedures, respectively. It is
shown that the first two procedures strongly control the FWER under arbitrary
dependence and are more powerful than the existing Tarone-type procedures,
while the last one only ensures control of the FWER in special settings.
Through extensive simulation studies, we provide numerical evidence of superior
performance of the proposed procedures in terms of the FWER control and minimal
power. A real clinical safety data is used to demonstrate applications of our

In this setup, source
messages are distributed among the senders possibly with common messages. In
addition, there are multiple receivers, with each receiver having some messages
a priori, known as side-information, and requesting one unique message such
that each message is requested by only one receiver. Index coding in this setup
is called two-sender unicast index coding (TSUIC). The main goal is to find the
shortest aggregate normalized codelength, which is expressed as the optimal
broadcast rate. In this work, firstly, for a given TSUIC problem, we form three
independent sub-problems each consisting of the only subset of the messages,
based on whether the messages are available only in one of the senders or in
both senders. Then we express the optimal broadcast rate of the TSUIC problem
as a function of the optimal broadcast rates of those independent sub-problems.
In this way, we discover the structural characteristics of TSUIC. For the
proofs of our results, we utilize confusion graphs and coding techniques used
in single-sender index coding. To adapt the confusion graph technique in TSUIC,
we introduce a new graph-coloring approach that is different from the normal
graph coloring, which we call two-sender graph coloring, and propose a way of
grouping the vertices to analyze the number of colors used. We further
determine a class of TSUIC instances where a certain type of side-information
can be removed without affecting their optimal broadcast rates. Finally, we
generalize the results of a class of TSUIC problems to multiple senders.

relying on material gain, we use parametric amplification by considering a
time-periodic modulation of the refractive index at a frequency equal to twice
the incident signal frequency. We show that the scattering from a simple
parametric slab, whose dynamics follow Mathieu equation, can be described by a
PT-symmetric scattering matrix, whose PT-breaking threshold corresponds to the
Mathieu instability threshold. By combining different parametric slabs
modulated out-of-phase, we create PT-symmetric time-Floquet systems that
feature exceptional scattering properties, such as CPA/Laser operation and
bidirectional invisibility. These bidirectional properties, rare for regular
PT-symmetric systems, are related to a compensation of parametric amplification
due to multiple scattering between two parametric systems modulated with a
phase difference.

specific azimuthal field was found to have quadruple symmetry and local maxima
inside the magnetosphere adjacent to the boundary layer. Cases of metallic and
dielectric dipole covers modeling good conductive and non-conductive ionosphere
revealed that the presence or absence of FACs results in different amplitudes
and spatial structures of the sheared field. The current associated with the
azimuthal field flows upward at the dawnside, and toward the equator plane at
the duskside. It was found to coincide by direction and to correspond by
amplitude to a total cross-polar current measured independently. The results
suggest that compressional and Alfven waves are responsible for FAC generation.

than one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral
arms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet
excites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous
speculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be
understood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A
planet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching
spiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is
in phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral
arm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference
can occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching
position of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk
temperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the
planet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus
larger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional
arms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses
for $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave
modes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the
primary arm. Improvements in our understanding of the formation of spiral arms
can provide crucial insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in
protoplanetary disks.

be used to constrain the masses of unseen planets and their positions within
their disks. By carrying out two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations varying
planet mass and disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number of spiral
arms form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. A planet
excites two or more spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of disk
temperature characterized by the disk aspect ratio $0.04\leq(h/r)_p\leq0.15$,
whereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral arms can form only in cold
disks with $(h/r)_p \lesssim 0.06$. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch
angle of spiral arms requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might
be challenging even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of
planet-driven spiral arms decreases away from the planet can be a powerful
diagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior or exterior to
the observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of
planet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends
on disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm
separations are measured. We apply these diagnostics to the spiral arms seen in
MWC 758 and Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al. (2017), planet-driven spiral
arms can create concentric rings and gaps, which can produce more dominant
observable signature than spiral arms under certain circumstances. We discuss
the observability of planet-driven spiral arms versus rings and gaps.

We further explore theoretical connections to normalized hypergraph cut on a

Method, which adds an ""inspect"" phase to existing algorithms that helps escape
from non-global stationary points. The inspection samples a set of points in a
radius $R$ around the current point. When a sample point yields a sufficient
decrease in the objective, we move there and resume an existing algorithm. If
no sufficient decrease is found, the current point is called an approximate
$R$-local minimizer. We show that an $R$-local minimizer is globally optimal,
up to a specific error depending on $R$, if the objective function can be
implicitly decomposed into a smooth convex function plus a restricted function
that is possibly nonconvex, nonsmooth. For high-dimensional problems, we
introduce blockwise inspections to overcome the curse of dimensionality while
still maintaining optimality bounds up to a factor equal to the number of
blocks. Our method performs well on a set of artificial and realistic nonconvex

  We propose a novel filter-type equalizer to improve the solution of the
linear minimum-mean squared-error (LMMSE) turbo equalizer, with computational
complexity constrained to be quadratic in the filter length. When high-order
modulations and/or large memory channels are used the optimal BCJR equalizer is
unavailable, due to its computational complexity. In this scenario, the
filter-type LMMSE turbo equalization exhibits a good performance compared to
other approximations. In this paper, we show that this solution can be
significantly improved by using expectation propagation (EP) in the estimation
of the a posteriori probabilities. First, it yields a more accurate estimation
of the extrinsic distribution to be sent to the channel decoder. Second,
compared to other solutions based on EP the computational complexity of the
proposed solution is constrained to be quadratic in the length of the finite
impulse response (FIR). In addition, we review previous EP-based turbo
equalization implementations. Instead of considering default uniform priors we
exploit the outputs of the decoder. Some simulation results are included to
show that this new EP-based filter remarkably outperforms the turbo approach of
previous versions of the EP algorithm and also improves the LMMSE solution,

are difficult to recognize at smaller and larger scales respectively, we
present a novel training scheme called Scale Normalization for Image Pyramids
(SNIP) which selectively back-propagates the gradients of object instances of
different sizes as a function of the image scale. On the COCO dataset, our

as a viable alternative to model checking with standard point-based temporal
logics, such as LTL, CTL, CTL*, and the like. The behavior of the system is
modeled by means of (finite) Kripke structures, as usual. However, while
temporal logics which are interpreted ""point-wise"" describe how the system
evolves state-by-state, and predicate properties of system states, those which
are interpreted ""interval-wise"" express properties of computation stretches,
spanning a sequence of states. A proposition letter is assumed to hold over a
computation stretch (interval) if and only if it holds over each component
state (homogeneity assumption). A natural question arises: is there any
advantage in replacing points by intervals as the primary temporal entities, or
is it just a matter of taste?
  In this paper, we study the expressiveness of Halpern and Shoham's interval
temporal logic (HS) in model checking, in comparison with those of LTL, CTL,
and CTL*. To this end, we consider three semantic variants of HS: the
state-based one, introduced by Montanari et al., that allows time to branch
both in the past and in the future, the computation-tree-based one, that allows
time to branch in the future only, and the trace-based variant, that disallows
time to branch. These variants are compared among themselves and to the
aforementioned standard logics, getting a complete picture. In particular, we
show that HS with trace-based semantics is equivalent to LTL (but at least
exponentially more succinct), HS with computation-tree-based semantics is
equivalent to finitary CTL*, and HS with state-based semantics is incomparable
with all of them (LTL, CTL, and CTL*).

  pictures. Comment welcome. Presented at ""X Black Holes Workshop"", Aveiro,
  Dec. 2017",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the Einstein field equations for a five-dimensional warped
spacetime, where only gravity can propagate into the bulk, determine the
dynamical evolution of the warp factor of the four-dimensional brane spacetime.
This can be explained as a holographic manifestation. The warped 5D model can
be reformulated by considering the warp factor as a dilaton field ($\omega$)
conformally coupled to gravity and embedded in a smooth $M_4 \otimes R$
manifold. On the brane, where the U(1) scalar gauge fields live, the dilaton
field manifests itself classically as a warp factor and enters the evolution
equations for the metric components and matter fields. We write the Lagrangian
for the Einstein-scalar gauge fields in a conformal invariant setting. However,
as expected, the conformal invariance is broken (trace-anomaly) by the
appearance of a mass term and a quadratic term in the energy-momentum tensor of
the scalar gauge field, arising from the extrinsic curvature terms in the
projected Einstein tensor. These terms can be interpreted as a constraint in
order to maintain conformal invariance. By considering the dilaton field and
Higgs field on equal footing on small scales, there will be no singular
behavior, when $\omega\rightarrow 0$ and one can deduce constraints to maintain
regularity of the action. Our conjecture is that $\omega$, alias warp factor,
has a dual meaning. At very early times, when $\omega \rightarrow 0$, it
describes the small-distance limit, while at later times it is a warp (or
scale) factor that determines the dynamical evolution of the universe. We also
present a numerical solution of the model and calculate the (time-dependent)
trace-anomaly. The solution depends on the mass ratio of the scalar and gauge
fields, the parameters of the model and the vortex charge $n$.

particularly evident in nonadiabatic systems, where the accuracy of this

DenseNet architecture - which normally is 2D - with 3D filters and pooling

Our experiments show that T3D outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods
on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets.
  The other issue in training 3D ConvNets is about training them from scratch
with a huge labeled dataset to get a reasonable performance. So the knowledge
learned in 2D ConvNets is completely ignored. Another contribution in this work
is a simple and effective technique to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained 2D
CNN to a randomly initialized 3D CNN for a stable weight initialization. This
allows us to significantly reduce the number of training samples for 3D CNNs.
Thus, by finetuning this network, we beat the performance of generic and recent
methods in 3D CNNs, which were trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-1M,
and finetuned on the target datasets, e.g. HMDB51/UCF101. The T3D codes will be

neural sources, which are embedded as a subspace into the recorded brain
signals. Decoding such processes from noisy
magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG) signals usually requires the
use of data-driven analysis methods. The objective evaluation of such decoding
algorithms on experimental raw signals, however, is a challenge: the amount of
available M/EEG data typically is limited, labels can be unreliable, and raw
signals often are contaminated with artifacts. The latter is specifically
problematic, if the artifacts stem from behavioral confounds of the oscillatory
neural processes of interest.
  To overcome some of these problems, simulation frameworks have been
introduced for benchmarking decoding methods. Generating artificial brain
signals, however, most simulation frameworks make strong and partially
unrealistic assumptions about brain activity, which limits the generalization
of obtained results to real-world conditions.
  In the present contribution, we thrive to remove many shortcomings of current

objective evaluation and benchmarking of novel data-driven decoding methods for
neural signals. Its central idea is to utilize post-hoc labelings of arbitrary
M/EEG recordings. This strategy makes it paradigm-agnostic and allows to
generate comparatively large datasets with noiseless labels. Source code and

approximation to the time-dependent Riesz tempered fractional problem is
provided without the fractional regularity assumption. Because the
time-dependent problems should become easier to solve as the time step $\tau
\rightarrow 0$, which correspond to the mass matrix dominant [R. E. Bank and T.
Dupont, {\em Math. Comp.}, 153 (1981), pp. 35--51]. Based on the introduced and
analysis of the fractional $\tau$-norm, the uniform convergence estimates of
the V-cycle multigrid method with the time-dependent fractional problem is
strictly proved, which means that the convergence rate of the V-cycle MGM is
independent of the mesh size $h$ and the time step $\tau$. The numerical
experiments are performed to verify the convergence with only $\mathcal{O}(N
\mbox{log} N)$ complexity by the fast Fourier transform method, where $N$ is
the number of the grid points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
proof for the convergence rate of the V-cycle multigrid finite element method
with $\tau\rightarrow 0$.

the electroweak production of a single top quark and a Higgs boson ($tH$). In
the Standard Model, the cross section for $tH$ production is much smaller than
the cross section for $t\bar{t}H$ production as there is a destructive
interference between diagrams where the Higgs boson is radiated off a top quark
and diagrams where it is radiated off a $W$ boson. Despite the reduced cross
section, this interference provides additional sensitivity to the sign of the
Yukawa coupling.

and applied more or less successfully to the isovector resonances, $a_0(980),
a_0(1450)$, as well as to the isodoublet resonances, $K^*_0(800), K^*_0(1430)$.
In this work, we present a more extensive view on the mixing framework and
extend this to the isoscalar resonances, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_0 (1370)$,
$f_0(1500)$. Tetraquarks in this framework can have two spin configurations
containing either spin-0 diquark or spin-1 diquark and each configuration forms
a nonet in flavor space. The two spin configurations are found to mix strongly
through the color-spin interactions. Their mixtures, which diagonalize the
hyperfine masses, can generate the physical resonances constituting the two
nonets, which, in fact, coincide roughly with the experimental observation. We
identify that $f_0 (500)$, $f_0(980)$ are the isoscalar members in the light
nonet, and $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ are the similar members in the heavy
nonet. This means that the spin configuration mixing, as it relates the
corresponding members in the two nonets, can generate $f_0 (500), f_0 (1370)$
among the members in light mass, and $f_0(980), f_0(1500)$ in heavy mass. The
complication arises because the isoscalar members of each nonet are subject to
an additional flavor mixing known as OZI rule so that $f_0 (500), f_0 (980)$,
and similarly $f_0 (1370), f_0 (1500)$, are the mixture of two isoscalar
members belonging to an octet and a singlet in SU$_f$(3). The tetraquark mixing
framework including the flavor mixing is tested for the isoscalar resonances in
terms of the mass splitting and the fall-apart decay modes.

that integrates the good features of different sources, such as JXTA, EXI,

EmbJXTAChord provides for several interesting properties, such as, distributed
and fault-tolerant resource discovery, transparent routing over subnetworks,
application protocol independence from the transport protocol in narrowband
WSN, thus eliminating the need for using dedicated software or configuring
custom gateways to achieve these functionalities. Moreover, EmbJXTAChord offers
native support not only for TCP/HTTP, but also for Bluetooth RFCOMM and
6LoWPAN, thus opening to a broad range of IoT devices in supernetworks composed
of networks using different interconnection technologies, not necessarily
IP-based. In addition, EmbJXTAChord offers security over heterogeneous networks
providing support for secure peergroups (even nested) and for group encryption,
thus allowing for unicast and multicast communication between groups of objects
sharing the same resources. Finally, EmbJXTAChord provides jxCOAP-E, a new CoAP
implementation that leverages on the transport mechanisms for heterogeneous
networks offered by EmbJXTAChord. jxCOAP-E enables to realize a RESTful service
architecture for peer-to-peer narrowband or broadband networks composed of
devices connected via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE or IEEE 802.15.4.
Differently from CoAP, jxCOAP-E provides a distributed and fault-tolerant
service discovery mechanism and support for secure multicast communications.
The paper presents EmbJXTAChord, discusses all the relevant design challenges
and presents a comparative experimental performance assessment with
state-of-the-art solutions on commercial-off-the-shelf devices.

by the interaction with its magnetic field. This occurs in a variety of
astrophysical settings involving young stellar objects, white dwarfs, and
neutron stars. As matter is endowed with angular momentum, its inflow toward
the star is often mediated by an accretion disc. The pressure of matter and
that originating from the stellar magnetic field balance at the magnetospheric
radius: at smaller distances the motion of matter is dominated by the magnetic
field, and funnelling towards the magnetic poles ensues. However, if the star,
and thus its magnetosphere, is fast spinning, most of the inflowing matter will
be halted at the magnetospheric radius by centrifugal forces, resulting in a
characteristic reduction of the accretion luminosity. The onset of this
mechanism, called the propeller, has been widely adopted to interpret a
distinctive knee in the decaying phase of the light curve of several
transiently accreting X-ray pulsar systems. By comparing the observed
luminosity at the knee for different classes of objects with the value
predicted by accretion theory on the basis of the independently measured
magnetic field, spin-period, mass, and radius of the star, we disclose here a
general relation for the onset of the propeller which spans about eight orders
of magnitude in spin period and ten in magnetic moment. The
parameter-dependence and normalisation constant that we determine are in
agreement with basic accretion theory.

matrix $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ with known matrix factorization $X = UW$,
where $U\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ is column-orthogonal, i.e. $U^TU=I$.
Arguably the most important methods that produce such factorizations are the
singular value decomposition (SVD), where $X=UW=U\Sigma V^T$, and the
QR-decomposition, where $X = UW = QR$. An elementary approach to produce a
column-orthogonal matrix $U_{new}$, whose columns span the same subspace as the
columns of the rank-one modified $X_{new} = X +ab^T$ is via applying a suitable
coordinate change such that in the new coordinates, the update affects a single
column and subsequently performing a Gram-Schmidt step for reorthogonalization.
This may be interpreted as a rank-one adaptation of the $U$-factor in the SVD
or a rank-one adaptation of the $Q$-factor in the QR-decomposition,
respectively, and leads to a decomposition for the adapted matrix $X_{new} =
U_{new}W_{new}$. By using a geometric approach, we show that this operation is
equivalent to traveling from the subspace $\mathcal{S}= \text{ran}(X)$ to the

addition, this allows us to determine the subspace distance between the

tidal deformations are probably the ultimate cause. Recent gravity and
libration data indicate that Enceladus's icy crust floats on a global ocean, is
rather thin, and has a strongly non-uniform thickness. Tidal effects are
enhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of
tidal tectonics and dissipation should take into account the lateral variations
of shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic
thin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations
of shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2D linear partial
differential equations of the 4th order on the sphere which take into account
self-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity.
If the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas
for tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5%
and 15%, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10% of the radius. If the
shell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of
coupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis. Compared to finite
element models, thin shell predictions are similar for the deformations due to
Enceladus's pressurized ocean, but differ for the tides of Ganymede. If
Enceladus's shell is conductive with isostatic thickness variations, surface
stresses are approximately inversely proportional to the local shell thickness.
The radial tide is only moderately enhanced at the south pole. The combination
of crustal thinning and convection below the poles can amplify south polar
stresses by a factor of 10, but it cannot explain the apparent time lag between
the maximum plume brightness and the opening of tiger stripes. In a second
paper, I will study tidal dissipation in a non-uniform crust.

interaction, while vacuum field fluctuations do not. By considering specific
geometric configurations of the two-atom-system with respect to the mirror and
specific choices of dipole orientations, we show that the presence of the
mirror significantly affects the resonance interaction energy and that
different features appear with respect to the case of atoms in free space, for
example a change in the spatial dependence of the interaction. Our findings
also suggest that the presence of a boundary can be exploited to tailor and
control the resonance interaction between two atoms, as well as the related
energy transfer process. The possibility of observing these phenomena is also
discussed.

significant physical and chemical differences with respect to other models. We
have included $^{15}$N fractionation of CN in neutral-neutral reactions and
also updated rate coefficients for key reactions in the nitrogen chemistry. We
find that the revised fractionation rates have the effect of suppressing
$^{15}$N enrichment in ammonia at all times, while the depletion is even more
pronounced, reaching $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios of >2000. Taking the updated
nitrogen chemistry into account, no significant enrichment occurs in HCN or
HNC, contrary to observational evidence in dark clouds and comets, although the
$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio can still be below 100 in CN itself. However, such low

the bulk $^{15}$N enhancements observed in primitive materials. It is clear
that alternative fractionating reactions are necessary to reproduce

methods can be classified into two categories: generative models that learn the
underlying connectivity distribution in the graph, and discriminative models
that predict the probability of edge existence between a pair of vertices. In
this paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning
framework unifying above two classes of methods, in which the generative model
and discriminative model play a game-theoretical minimax game. Specifically,
for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true
connectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces ""fake"" samples
to fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to
detect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the
generative model. With the competition between these two models, both of them
can alternately and iteratively boost their performance. Moreover, when
considering the implementation of generative model, we propose a novel graph
softmax to overcome the limitations of traditional softmax function, which can
be proven satisfying desirable properties of normalization, graph structure
awareness, and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments on
real-world datasets, we demonstrate that GraphGAN achieves substantial gains in
a variety of applications, including link prediction, node classification, and

robot with high degrees of freedom (e.g., a humanoid robot).
High-dimensionality of the robot configuration space often leads to
difficulties in utilizing the widely-used motion planning algorithms, since the
volume of the decision space increases exponentially with the number of
dimensions. To handle complications arising from the large decision space, and
to solve a corresponding motion planning problem efficiently, two key concepts
are adopted in this work: First, the Gaussian process latent variable model
(GP-LVM) is utilized for low-dimensional representation of the original
configuration space. Second, an approximate inference algorithm is used,
exploiting through the duality between control and estimation, to explore the
decision space and to compute a high-quality motion trajectory of the robot.
Utilizing the GP-LVM and the duality between control and estimation, we
construct a fully probabilistic generative model with which a high-dimensional
motion planning problem is transformed into a tractable inference problem.
Finally, we compute the motion trajectory via an approximate inference
algorithm based on a variant of the particle filter. The resulting motions can
be viewed in the supplemental video. ( https://youtu.be/kngEaOR4Esc )

advancement of computer vision. Despite their promising performances on many
tasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine
intelligence. One is that CNNs are complex and hard to interpret. Another is
that standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes
hard to obtain, and it is desirable to learn to recognize objects from few
examples. In this work, we address these limitations of CNNs by developing
novel, flexible, and interpretable models for few-shot learning. Our models are
based on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts (VCs), which
are interpretable visual cues represented by the feature vectors within CNNs.
We first adapt the learning of VCs to the few-shot setting, and then uncover
two key properties of feature encoding using VCs, which we call category
sensitivity and spatial pattern. Motivated by these properties, we present two
intuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning. Experiments show that
our models achieve competitive performances, while being more flexible and
interpretable than alternative state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. We
conclude that using VCs helps expose the natural capability of CNNs for
few-shot learning.

to the complexity of real markets, we consider that the investors are connected
among them through a small world network; each one has its own psychological
profile (Imitation, Anti-Imitation, Random); two different strategies for
decision making: one of them is based on the trust neighborhood of the investor
and the other one considers a technical analysis, the momentum of the market
index technique. We analyze the market index fluctuations, the wealth
distribution of the investors according to their psychological profiles and the
rate of return distribution. Moreover, we analyze the influence of changing the
psychological profile of the hub of the network and report interesting results
which show how and when anti-imitation becomes the most profitable strategy for
investment. Besides this, an intriguing asymmetry of the return rate
distribution is explained considering the behavioral aspect of the investors.
This asymmetry is quite robust being observed even when a completely different
algorithm to calculate the decision making of the investors was applied to it,
a remarkable result which, up to our knowledge, has never been reported before.

Khammash (Cell Systems, 2017) is known to ensure robust perfect adaptation for
the mean dynamics of a given molecular species involved in a complex stochastic
biomolecular reaction network. However, it was observed that it also leads to a
higher variance in the controlled network than that obtained when using a
constitutive (i.e. open-loop) control strategy. This was interpreted as the
cost of the adaptation property and may be viewed as a performance
deterioration for the overall controlled network. To decrease this variance and
improve the performance, we propose to combine the antithetic integral feedback
motif with a negative feedback strategy. Both theoretical and numerical results
are obtained. The theoretical ones are based on a tailored moment closure
method allowing one to obtain approximate expressions for the stationary
variance for the controlled network and predict that the variance can indeed be
decreased by increasing the strength of the negative feedback. Numerical
results verify the accuracy of this approximation and show that the controlled
species variance can indeed be decreased, sometimes below its constitutive
level. Three molecular networks are considered in order to verify the wide
applicability of two types of negative feedback strategies. The main conclusion
is that there is a trade-off between the speed of the settling-time of the mean

charge, two equal magnitude angular momenta and the magnitude of the magnetic
potential at infinity. These black holes possess a horizon of spherical
topology; however, both the horizon and the sphere at infinity can be
arbitrarily squashed, with nonextremal solutions interpolating between black
strings and black branes. A particular set of extremal configurations
corresponds to a new one-parameter family of supersymmetric black holes. While
their conserved charges are determined by the squashing of the sphere at

results in a significant reduction of the line width of the Raman modes of
black phosphorus, due to a reduced phonon scattering rate. We observe a so far
elusive peak in the Raman spectra $\sim$4cm$^{-1}$ above the A$_{\text{g}}^1$
mode in trilayer and thicker flakes, which had not been observed
experimentally. The newly observed mode originates from the strong black
phosphorus inter-layer interaction, which induces a hardening of the surface
atoms vibration with respect to the corresponding modes of the inner layers.
The observation of this mode suggests a significant impact of h-BN
encapsulation on the properties of black phosphorus and can serve as an
indicator of the quality of its surface.

sequence of Cayley graphs such that |S_n^n|=O(n^D|S_n|), then the sequence
(G_n,d_{S_n}/n) is relatively compact for the Gromov-Hausdorff topology and
every cluster point is a connected nilpotent Lie group equipped with a
left-invariant sub-Finsler metric. In this paper we show that the dimension of
such a cluster point is bounded by D, and that, under the stronger bound
|S_n^n|=O(n^D), the homogeneous dimension of a cluster point is bounded by D.
Our approach is roughly to use a well-known structure theorem for approximate
groups due to Breuillard, Green and Tao to replace S_n^n with a coset
nilprogression of bounded rank, and then to use results about nilprogressions
from a previous paper of ours to study the ultralimits of such coset
nilprogressions. As an application we bound the dimension of the scaling limit
of a sequence of vertex-transitive graphs of large diameter. We also recover
and effectivise parts of an argument of Tao concerning the further growth of
single set S satisfying the bound |S^n| < Mn^D|S|.

systems, particularly suited in application domains such as smart cities,
complex sensor networks, and the Internet of Things. These systems tend to
feature large scale, heterogeneity of communication model (including
opportunistic peer-to-peer wireless interaction), and require inherent
self-adaptiveness properties to address unforeseen changes in operating
conditions. In this context, it is extremely difficult (if not seemingly
intractable) to engineer reusable pieces of distributed behaviour so as to make
them provably correct and smoothly composable.
  Building on the field calculus, a computational model (and associated
toolchain) capturing the notion of aggregate network-level computation, we
address this problem with an engineering methodology coupling formal theory and
computer simulation. On the one hand, functional properties are addressed by
identifying the largest-to-date field calculus fragment generating
self-stabilising behaviour, guaranteed to eventually attain a correct and
stable final state despite any transient perturbation in state or topology, and
including highly reusable building blocks for information spreading,
aggregation, and time evolution. On the other hand, dynamical properties are
addressed by simulation, empirically evaluating the different performances that
can be obtained by switching between implementations of building blocks with
provably equivalent functional properties. Overall, our methodology sheds light
on how to identify core building blocks of collective behaviour, and how to
select implementations that improve system performance while leaving overall
system function and resiliency properties unchanged.

of an attractive electron-electron interaction but can be described in terms of
quantum mechanical constraining forces constraining the electrons to form
Cooper pairs. There is theoretical and experimental evidence that only this
nonadiabatic mechanism operating in superconducting bands may produce
eigenstates in which the electrons form Cooper pairs. These constraining forces
stabilize the Cooper pairs in any superconductor, whether conventional or

external inputs remain poorly understood. Recent work has focused on the
response of a single neuron to a weak, subthreshold periodic signal. By
simulating the FitzHugh-Nagumo stochastic model and then using a symbolic
method to analyze the firing activity of the neuron, preferred and infrequent
spike patterns (defined by the relative timing of the spikes) were detected,
whose probabilities encode information about the signal. As not individual
neurons in isolation but neuronal populations are responsible for the emergence
of complex behaviors, a relevant question is whether this coding mechanism is
robust when the neuron is not isolated. We study how a second neuron, which
does not perceive the subthreshold signal, affects the detection and the
encoding of the signal, done by the first neuron. Through simulations of two
coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons we show that the coding mechanism is indeed
robust, as the neuron that perceives the signal fires a spike train that has
symbolic patterns whose probabilities depend on the features of the signal.
Moreover, we show that the second neuron facilitates the detection of the
signal, by lowering the firing threshold of the first neuron. This in turn
decreases the internal noise level need to fire the spikes that encode the
signal. We also show that the probabilities of the symbolic patterns achieve
maximum or minimum values when the period of the external signal is close to
(or is half of) the mean firing period of the neuron.

The tomographic method allows to recover the distribution of the component of
the velocity field projected on the line of sight at different optical depths

restricted range of optical depths. On the other hand, in 3D simulations, the
line formation depths are spread in the atmosphere mainly because of
temperature and density inhomogeneities. Comparison of CCF profiles obtained

are proposed: (i) the Galerkin/least-squares method with dynamic small-scales
(GLSD) and (ii) the dynamic orthogonal formulation (DO). The methods are
presented in combination with an energy-decaying generalized-$\alpha$
time-integrator. Numerical verification shows that dissipation due to the
small-scales in classical stabilized methods can become negative, both on a
local and global scale. The results show that without loss of accuracy the
correct-energy behavior can be recovered by the proposed methods. The
computations employ NURBS-based isogeometric analysis for the spatial
discretization.

paper to build a stabilized method within the variational multiscale (VMS)
setting which displays correct-energy behavior. Similar to the
convection--diffusion case, a key ingredient is the proper dynamic and
orthogonal behavior of the small-scales. This is demanded for correct energy
behavior and links the VMS framework to the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin
(SUPG) and the Galerkin/least-squares method (GLS).
  The presented method is a Galerkin/least-squares formulation with dynamic
divergence-free small-scales (GLSDD). It is locally mass-conservative for both
the large- and small-scales separately. In addition, it locally conserves
linear and angular momentum. The computations require and employ NURBS-based
isogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization. The resulting formulation
numerically shows improved energy behavior for turbulent flows comparing with
the original VMS method.

structure formation in dilute wormlike micellar solutions. The micellar
solution is treated as a dilute suspension of rigid Brownian rods whose length
varies dynamically. Consistent with the mechanism presented by Turner and Cates
[J. Phys.:~Condens. Matter 4, 3719 (1992)], flow-induced alignment of the rods
is assumed to promote increase of rod length that corresponds to the formation
of flow-induced structures observed in experiments. At very high deformation
rate, hydrodynamic stresses causes the rod length to decrease. These mechanisms
are implemented in a phenomenological equation governing the evolution of rod
length, with the number density of rods appropriately modified to ensure
conservation of surfactant mass. The model leads first to an increase in both
shear and extensional viscosity as deformation rate increases and then to a
decrease at higher rates. If the rate constant for flow-induced rod growth is
sufficiently large, the model predicts a multivalued relation between stress
and deformation rate in both shear and uniaxial extension. Predictions for
shear and extensional flow at steady state are in reasonable agreement with
experimental results. By design, the model is simple enough to serve as a
tractable constitutive relation for computational fluid dynamics studies.

topological mechanical states with two type of bosons, Dirac and Weyl bosons,
were reported in some macroscopic systems of kHz frequency and those with a
type of doubly-Weyl phonons in atomic vibrational framework of THz frequency of
solid crystals were recently predicted. However, to date no three-component
bosons of phonon has been reported. Here, through first-principles
calculations, we have reported that the phonon spectra of the WC-type TiS,
ZrSe, and HfTe commonly host the unique triply degenerate nodal points (TDNPs)
and single two-component Weyl points (WPs) in THz frequency. Quasiparticle
excitations near TDNPs of phonons are three-component bosons, beyond the
conventional and known classifications of Dirac, Weyl and doubly-Weyl phonons.
{Moreover, we have found that both TiS and ZrSe have five pairs of type-I Weyl
phonons and a pair of type-II Weyl phonons, whereas HfTe only has four pairs of
type-I Weyl phonons. They carry non-zero topological charges. On the
(10$\bar{1}$0) crystal surfaces, we observe topological protected surface arc
states connecting two WPs with opposite charges, which host modes that
propagate nearly in one direction on the surface.

by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo paves the unprecedented way for
multi-messenger observations. The propagation speed of this GW can be
scrutinized by comparing the arrival times between GW and neutrinos or photons.
It provides the constraint on the mass of the graviton. f(R) gravity theories
have the habitual non-zero mass gravitons in addition to usual massless ones.
Previously, we show that the model independent f(R) gravity theories can be
constructed from the both background evolution and the matter growth with one
undetermined parameter. We show that this parameter can be constrained from the
graviton mass bound obtained from GW detection. Thus, the GW detection provides
the invaluable constraint on the validity of f(R) gravity theories.

the continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol with discrete
modulation against collective attacks by using the reliable tomography of the
covariance matrix, leading to the reliable and tight error bounds in the
derived confidence regions. Combining the proof with de Finetti reduction, the
discrete-modulation-based continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(DM-CVQKD) is proved to be secure even exposing to general attacks. Specially,
we use an energy test to truncate the Hilbert space globally to provide
security.

a two-user decentralized interference channel, assuming that the transmitters
are unaware of the instantaneous CSIs. The availability of the channel state
information at receivers (CSIR) is considered in two scenarios of perfect and
imperfect CSIR. In the imperfect CSIR case, we consider a more practical
assumption of having an MMSE estimation of the channel gain at the receivers.
In this case, minimizing the expected achievable distortion associated with
each link is considered. Due to the absence of CSI at the transmitters, the
Gaussian sources are encoded in a successively refinable manner and the
resulting code words are transmitted over the channel using a multi-layer
coding technique. Accordingly, the optimal power assignment between code layers
leading to the least expected achievable distortion, under a mean-square error
criterion is derived for both, the perfect and imperfect CSIR scenarios.
Finally, some numerical examples are provided and it is demonstrated that the
proposed method results in better performance as compared with the conventional
single-layer approach, termed as outage approach.

role in processing the spectrum of graph signals. This paper proposes two
different strategies for designing autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph
filters on both directed and undirected graphs. The first approach is inspired
by Prony's method, which considers a modified error between the modeled and the
desired frequency response. The second technique is based on an iterative
approach, which finds the filter coefficients by iteratively minimizing the
true error (instead of the modified error) between the modeled and the desired
frequency response. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and
compared with finite impulse response (FIR) graph filters, on both synthetic
and real data. The obtained results show that ARMA filters outperform FIR
filters in terms of approximation accuracy and they are suitable for graph
signal interpolation, compression and prediction.

Raspberry broadcasts them via a web page. For such activity is possible thanks
to Raspbian, a Linux-based operating system. It has a lot of libraries and
resources available, among them Apache Web Server, that gives the possibility
to host a web-page. On it, the user can observe temperature, humidity, solar
radiance, and wind speed and direction. Information on the web-page is
refreshed each five minute; however, measurements arrive at Raspberry every ten
seconds. This low refreshment rate was determined because weather variables
normally do not abruptly change. As an additional feature, system stores all
information on the log file, this gives the possibility for future analysis and

challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature and various artifacts presented
in 2D X-ray images. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system with an auto
attention mechanism for robust and efficient 2D/3D image registration.
Specifically, an individual agent is trained with dilated Fully Convolutional
Network (FCN) to perform registration in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by
observing a local region, and the final action is then taken based on the
proposals from multiple agents and weighted by their corresponding confidence
levels. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we formulate
2D/3D registration as a MDP with observations, actions, and rewards properly
defined with respect to X-ray imaging systems. Second, to handle various
artifacts in 2D X-ray images, multiple local agents are employed efficiently
via FCN-based structures, and an auto attention mechanism is proposed to favor
the proposals from regions with more reliable visual cues. Third, a dilated
FCN-based training mechanism is proposed to significantly reduce the Degree of
Freedom in the simulation of registration environment, and drastically improve
training efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to standard CNN-based
training method. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high
robustness on both spine cone beam Computed Tomography data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio and data from minimally invasive spine surgery where
severe image artifacts and occlusions are presented due to metal screws and
guide wires, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods (single agent-based
and optimization-based) by a large margin.

feature maps of convolutional networks. To this end, we study a number of
methods for video-based person re-identification and make the following
findings: 1) Max-pooling only focuses on the maximum value of a receptive
field, wasting a lot of information. 2) Networks with different streams even
including the one with the worst performance work better than networks with
same streams, where each one has the best performance alone. 3) A full
connection layer at the end of convolutional networks is not necessary. Based
on these studies, we propose a new convolutional architecture termed
Three-Stream Convolutional Networks (TSCN). It first uses different streams to
learn different aspects of feature maps for attentive spatio-temporal fusion of
video, and then merges them together to study some union features. To further
utilize the feature maps, two architectures are designed by using the
strategies of multi-scale and upsampling. Comparative experiments on iLIDS-VID,
PRID-2011 and MARS datasets illustrate that the proposed architectures are
significantly better for feature extraction than the state-of-the-art models.

The aim of this strategy is to fulfill the requirements of legislations and
lower cost of the operation by avoiding operational problems. If CCS is going
to be a widespread technology to deliver energy without CO2 emissions,
cost-efficient monitoring programs will be a key to reduce the storage costs. A
simulation framework, previously used to estimate flow parameters at Sleipner
Layer 9 [1], is here extended and employed to identify how the number of
measurements can be reduced without significantly reducing the obtained
information. The main part of the methodology is based on well-proven, stable
and robust, simulation technology together with adjoint-based sensitivities and
data mining techniques using singular value decomposition (SVD). In particular
we combine the simulation framework with time-dependent (seismic) measurements
of the migrating plume. We also study how uplift data and gravitational data
give complementary information.
  We apply this methodology to the Sleipner project, which provides the most
extensive data for CO2 storage to date. For this study we utilize a
vertical-equilibrium (VE) flow model for computational efficiency as
implemented in the open-source software MRST-co2lab.
  However, our methodology for deriving efficient monitoring schemes is not
restricted to VE-type flow models, and at the end, we discuss how the
methodology can be used in the context of full 3D simulations.
