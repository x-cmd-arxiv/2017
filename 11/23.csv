most commonly based on subjective clinical interpretations. Quantitative
electroencephalography (QEEG) measures have been shown to reflect
neurodegenerative processes in AD and might qualify as affordable and thereby
widely available markers to facilitate the objectivization of AD assessment.
Here, we present a novel framework combining Riemannian tangent space mapping
and elastic net regression for the development of brain atrophy markers. While
most AD QEEG studies are based on small sample sizes and psychological test
scores as outcome measures, here we train and test our models using data of one
of the largest prospective EEG AD trials ever conducted, including MRI
biomarkers of brain atrophy.

relay nodes and multiple channels per hop, we consider two traffic allocation
schemes, namely local allocation and global allocation, and investigate the
end-to-end latency of a file transfer. We formulate the problem for generic
multi-hop queuing systems and subsequently derive closed-form expressions of
the end-to-end latency. We quantify the advantages of the global allocation
scheme relative to its local allocation counterpart, and we conduct an
asymptotic analysis on the performance gain when the number of channels in each
hop increases to infinity. The traffic allocations and the analytical delay
performance are validated through simulations. Furthermore, taking a specific
two-hop mm-wave network as an example, we derive lower bounds on the average
end-to-end latency, where Nakagami-$m$ fading is considered. Numerical results
demonstrate that, compared to the local allocation scheme, the advantage of
global allocation grows as the number of relay nodes increases, at the expense
of higher complexity that linearly increases with the number of relay nodes. It
is also demonstrated that a proper deployment of relay nodes in a linear
mm-wave network plays an important role in reducing the average end-to-end
latency, and the average latency decays as the mm-wave channels become more
deterministic. These findings provide insights for designing multi-hop mm-wave
networks with low end-to-end latency.

  Convolutional Networks","Accepted to ECCV 2018",,,,"cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hash codes are efficient data representations for coping with the ever
growing amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a random forest semantic
hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into
shallow random forests, with near-optimal information-theoretic code
aggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme, where random
trees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting `1' for the visited tree
leaf, and `0' for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to
generate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees,
rendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this,
we propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node
into two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification
problem, which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such
random class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to
share its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional
low-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code
consistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class
distance for the two random class groups. Finally, we introduce an
information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a
single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
for image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets, while performing at
the level of other state-of-the-art image classification techniques while
utilizing a more compact and efficient scalable representation. This work
proposes a principled and robust procedure to train and deploy in parallel an
ensemble of light-weight CNNs, instead of simply going deeper.

Earth-bound observers are modulated by the motions of the observer with respect
to the source, and through relativistic effects. These modulations depend
critically on the source's sky-location. Precise knowledge of the modulations
are required to coherently track the source's phase over long observations, for
example, in pulsar timing, or searches for continuous gravitational waves. The
modulations can be modelled as sky-location and time-dependent time delays that
convert arrival times at the observer to the inertial frame of the source,
which can often be the Solar system barycentre. We study the use of reduced
order modelling for speeding up the calculation of this time delay for any
sky-location. We find that the time delay model can be decomposed into just
four basis vectors, and with these the delay for any sky-location can be
reconstructed to sub-nanosecond accuracy. When compared to standard routines
for time delay calculation in gravitational wave searches, using the reduced
basis can lead to speed-ups of 30 times. We have also studied components of
time delays for sources in binary systems. Assuming eccentricities $< 0.25$ we
can reconstruct the delays to within 100s of nanoseconds, with best case
speed-ups of a factor of 10, or factors of two when interpolating the basis for
different orbital periods or time stamps. In long-duration phase-coherent
searches for sources with sky-position uncertainties, or binary parameter
uncertainties, these speed-ups could allow enhancements in their scopes without
large additional computational burdens.

thermoelectric materials since they exhibit extremely low thermal
conductivities as a result of phonon scattering on the boundaries of the
various material phases. The nanoinclusions, however, should not degrade the
thermoelectric power factor, and ideally should increase it, so that benefits
to the ZT figure of merit can be achieved. In this work we employ the
Non-Equilibrium Greens Function (NEGF) quantum transport method to calculate
the electronic and thermoelectric coefficients of materials embedded with
nanoinclusions. For computational effectiveness we consider two-dimensional
nanoribbon geometries, however, the method includes the details of geometry,
electron-phonon interactions, quantisation, tunneling, and the ballistic to
diffusive nature of transport, all combined in a unified approach. This makes
it a convenient and accurate way to understand electronic and thermoelectric
transport in nanomaterials, beyond semiclassical approximations, and beyond
approximations that deal with the complexities of the geometry. We show that
the presence of nanoinclusions within a matrix material offers opportunities
for only weak energy filtering, significantly lower in comparison to
superlattices, and thus only moderate power factor improvements. However, we
describe how such nanocomposites can be optimised to limit degradation in the
thermoelectric power factor and elaborate on the conditions that achieve the
aforementioned mild improvements. Importantly, we show that under certain
conditions, the power factor is independent of the density of nanoinclusions,
meaning that materials with large nanoinclusion densities which provide very
low thermal conductivities, can also retain large power factors and result in
large ZT figures of merit.

to automatically discover for each returned cluster the most appropriate

large-scale mmWave MIMO systems because of its ability to significantly reduce
the hardware complexity of the conventional fully-digital beamforming schemes
while being capable of approaching the performance of fully-digital schemes.
Most of the prior work on hybrid beamforming considers narrowband channels.
However, broadband systems such as mmWave systems are frequency-selective. In
broadband systems, it is desirable to design common analog beamformer for the
entire band while employing different digital beamformers in different
frequency sub-bands. This paper considers hybrid beamforming design for systems
with OFDM modulation. First, for a SU-MIMO system where the hybrid beamforming
architecture is employed at both transmitter and receiver, we show that hybrid
beamforming with a small number of RF chains can asymptotically approach the
performance of fully-digital beamforming for a sufficiently large number of
transceiver antennas due to the sparse nature of the mmWave channels. For
systems with a practical number of antennas, we then propose a unified
heuristic design for two different hybrid beamforming structures, the
fully-connected and the partially-connected structures, to maximize the overall
spectral efficiency of a mmWave MIMO system. Numerical results are provided to
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing hybrid beamforming
methods and for the fully-connected architecture the proposed algorithm can
achieve spectral efficiency very close to that of the optimal fully-digital
beamforming but with much fewer RF chains. Second, for the MU-MISO case, we
propose a heuristic hybrid percoding design to maximize the weighted sum rate
in the downlink and show numerically that the proposed algorithm with practical
number of RF chains can already approach the performance of fully-digital
beamforming.

increasing feature dimensionality in target problems and growing interest in
advanced but computationally expensive methodologies able to model complex
associations. Specifically, there is a need for feature selection methods that
are computationally efficient, yet sensitive to complex patterns of
association, e.g. interactions, so that informative features are not mistakenly
eliminated prior to downstream modeling. This paper focuses on Relief-based
algorithms (RBAs), a unique family of filter-style feature selection algorithms
that have gained appeal by striking an effective balance between these
objectives while flexibly adapting to various data characteristics, e.g.
classification vs. regression. First, this work broadly examines types of
feature selection and defines RBAs within that context. Next, we introduce the
original Relief algorithm and associated concepts, emphasizing the intuition
behind how it works, how feature weights generated by the algorithm can be
interpreted, and why it is sensitive to feature interactions without evaluating
combinations of features. Lastly, we include an expansive review of RBA
methodological research beyond Relief and its popular descendant, ReliefF. In
particular, we characterize branches of RBA research, and provide comparative
summaries of RBA algorithms including contributions, strategies, functionality,
time complexity, adaptation to key data characteristics, and software

of holography; I focused in especially on the impact of the chiral anomaly at
transport properties and non-equilbrium behaviour in response to an holographic
quench. Concretely, I considered an $U(1)_\text{A}\times
U(1)_\text{V}$-Einstein-Maxwell bottom-up model consisting of two massless
gauge fields, coupled by a Chern-Simons term in the fivedimensional AdS
spacetime. The two gauge fields provide a time dependent electric field and a
static magnetic field, parallel to it. As response of the system to quench, I
investigated the electromagnetic current in direction of the magnetic field
which is generated due to the CME. In the first part of the thesis, I
characterised the initial response of the system, in a fixed Schwarzschild AdS
background, subjected to a 'fast' quench. The corresponding hyperbolic PDE is
solved by means of a fully spectral code in spaces as well as in time
direction. Note that this was the first application of a fully spectral code
within holography. In the case of 'fast' quenches, the system exhibits an
universal scaling behaviour, independent of the external parameters as the
strength of the anomaly and the magnetic field, respectively. The late time
behaviour of the system shows, depending on the quench and external parameters,
in some cases long lived oscillations in the current. Furthermore, I computed
the quasi-normal modes of the systems, including the backreaction of the matter
fields on the background metric. It turns out that the long lived oscillations
appear only in presence of the anomaly and can be traced back to the presence
of Landau levels in the system. The results of my master thesis were partly
published in arXiv:1607.06817; however, the thesis contains a lot of
interesting, and so far unpublished, results and can be viewed as extended

-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}^N} - \lambda$ where $0 \leq \lambda \leq
\lambda_{1}(\mathbb{H}^N)$ and $\lambda_{1}(\mathbb{H}^N)$ is the bottom of the

its return time (or return period), is a useful statistical concept for
practical applications. For instance insurances or public agency may be
interested by the return time of a 10m flood of the Seine river in Paris.
However, due to their scarcity, reliably estimating return times for rare
events is very difficult using either observational data or direct numerical
simulations. For rare events, an estimator for return times can be built from
the extrema of the observable on trajectory blocks. Here, we show that this
estimator can be improved to remain accurate for return times of the order of
the block size. More importantly, we show that this approach can be generalised
to estimate return times from numerical algorithms specifically designed to
sample rare events. So far those algorithms often compute probabilities, rather
than return times. The approach we propose provides a computationally extremely
efficient way to estimate numerically the return times of rare events for a
dynamical system, gaining several orders of magnitude of computational costs.
We illustrate the method on two kinds of observables, instantaneous and
time-averaged, using two different rare event algorithms, for a simple
stochastic process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As an example of realistic
applications to complex systems, we finally discuss extreme values of the drag
on an object in a turbulent flow.

Telescope, Spitzer, and on ground-based facilities) have allowed the scientific
community to obtain important information on the physical and chemical
properties of these planets. However, for a more in-depth characterisation of
these worlds, more powerful telescopes are needed. Thanks to the high
sensitivity of their instruments, the next generation of space observatories
(e.g. JWST, ARIEL) will provide observations of unprecedented quality, allowing
us to extract far more information than what was previously possible. Such high
quality observations will provide constraints on theoretical models of
exoplanet atmospheres and lead to a greater understanding of their physics and
chemistry. Important modelling efforts have been carried out during the past
few years, showing that numerous parameters and processes (such as the
elemental abundances, temperature, mixing, etc.) are likely to affect the
atmospheric composition of exoplanets and subsequently the observable spectra.
In this manuscript, we review the different parameters that can influence the
molecular composition of exoplanet atmospheres. We show that the high-precision
of ARIEL observations will improve our view and characterisation of exoplanet
atmospheres. We also consider future developments that are necessary to improve
atmospheric models, driven by the need to interpret the available observations.

constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, through Bayesian
inference. Because these constraints depend on the choice for the prior
probability $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$, we argue that this prior should be motivated
by fundamental physical principles rather than the ad hoc choices that are
common in the literature. The first step in this direction is to specify the
prior directly at the level of the neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$, since this is
the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian of the particle physics theory. Thus
by specifying a probability distribution over $M_\nu$, and by including the
known squared mass splittings, we predict a theoretical probability
distribution over $\Sigma m_\nu$ that we interpret as a Bayesian prior
probability $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$. We find that $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$ peaks close
to the smallest $\Sigma m_\nu$ allowed by the measured mass splittings, roughly
$0.06 \, {\rm eV}$ ($0.1 \, {\rm eV}$) for normal (inverted) ordering, due to
the phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion in random matrices. We consider three
models for neutrino mass generation: Dirac, Majorana, and Majorana via the
seesaw mechanism; differences in the predicted priors $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$ allow
for the possibility of having indications about the physical origin of neutrino
masses once sufficient experimental sensitivity is achieved. We present fitting
functions for $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$, which provide a simple means for applying
these priors to cosmological constraints on the neutrino masses or
marginalizing over their impact on other cosmological parameters.

the amplitudes of the kSZ effect resulting from the two models are both on the
order of $\Delta T/T\sim10^{-5}$; but their morphologies are different, which
trace the different line-of-sight velocity distributions of the systems; (2)
the relativistic correction of the tSZ effect around $240 {\rm\,GHz}$ can be
possibly used to constrain the temperature of the hot electrons heated by the
shocks; and (3) the shift between the X-ray spectral lines emitted from
different regions of the cluster can be significantly different in the two
models. The shift and the line broadening can be up to $\sim 25{\rm\,eV}$ and
$50{\rm\,eV}$, respectively. We expect that future observations of the kSZ

detected with 2.2 sigma significance, dropping to 2 sigma when the primordial

previous work we now allow the spectrum to have arbitrary scale-dependence. Our
non-parametric reconstruction then suggests several spectral features, the most
prominent at k ~ 0.006/Mpc. When a constant quadrupolar modulation is fitted to
data in the range 0.005 < k Mpc < 0.008, its preferred directions are found to
be related to the cosmic hemispherical asymmetry and the CMB dipole. To
determine the significance we apply two test statistics to our reconstructions

realisations of noise only. With a test statistic sensitive only to the
amplitude of the modulation, the reconstructions from the multipole range 30 <

speed up Gaussian elimination. This ordering is based on viewing the non-zero
elements of a symmetric positive definite matrix as edges of an undirected
graph, and aims at reducing the additional non-zeros (fill) in the matrix by
repeatedly removing the vertex of minimum degree. It is one of the most widely
used primitives for pre-processing sparse matrices in scientific computing.
  Our result is in part motivated by the observation that sub-quadratic time
algorithms for finding min-degree orderings are unlikely, assuming the strong
exponential time hypothesis (SETH). This provides justification for the lack of
provably efficient algorithms for generating such orderings, and leads us to
study speedups via degree-restricted algorithms as well as approximations. Our
two main results are: (1) an algorithm that produces a min-degree ordering
whose maximum degree is bounded by $\Delta$ in $O(m \Delta \log^3{n})$ time,
and (2) an algorithm that finds an $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate marginal
min-degree ordering in $O(m \log^{5}n \epsilon^{-2})$ time.
  Both of our algorithms rely on a host of randomization tools related to the
$\ell_0$-estimator by [Cohen `97]. A key technical issue for the final
nearly-linear time algorithm are the dependencies of the vertex removed on the
randomness in the data structures. To address this, we provide a method for
generating a pseudo-deterministic access sequence, which then allows the
incorporation of data structures that only work under the oblivious adversary

  Computing via Work Exchange",,,,,"cs.DC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Owing to data-intensive large-scale applications, distributed computation
systems have gained significant recent interest, due to their ability of
running such tasks over a large number of commodity nodes in a time efficient
manner. One of the major bottlenecks that adversely impacts the time efficiency
is the computational heterogeneity of distributed nodes, often limiting the
task completion time due to the slowest worker.
  In this paper, we first present a lower bound on the expected computation
time based on the work-conservation principle. We then present our approach of
work exchange to combat the latency problem, in which faster workers can be
reassigned additional leftover computations that were originally assigned to
slower workers. We present two variations of the work exchange approach: a)
when the computational heterogeneity knowledge is known a priori; and b) when
heterogeneity is unknown and is estimated in an online manner to assign tasks
to distributed workers. As a baseline, we also present and analyze the use of
an optimized Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) coded distributed computation
scheme over heterogeneous nodes. Simulation results also compare the proposed
approach of work exchange, the baseline MDS coded scheme and the lower bound
obtained via work-conservation principle. We show that the work exchange scheme
achieves time for computation which is very close to the lower bound with
limited coordination and communication overhead even when the knowledge about
heterogeneity levels is not available.

sizeable for three minimal extensions of the Standard Model: a singlet

that the known two-loop RGEs tend to moderate the running of their one-loop

addition of vector-like quarks we show that the complete two-loop matching and

temperature distributions of planets as a function of height in their
atmospheres. For example, 3.6 micron emission originates from deeper layers of
the atmosphere than 4.5 micron due to greater water vapor absorption at the
longer wavelength. Since heat transport efficiency increases with pressure, we
expect thermal phase curves at 3.6 micron to exhibit smaller amplitudes and
greater phase offsets than at 4.5 micron; this trend is not observed. Of the
seven hot Jupiters with full-orbit phase curves at 3.6 and 4.5 micron, all have
greater phase amplitude at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, while four of seven
exhibit a greater phase offset at 3.6 micron. We use a 3D
radiative-hydrodynamic model to calculate theoretical phase curves of HD
189733b, assuming thermo-chemical equilibrium. The model exhibits temperature,
pressure, and wavelength dependent opacity, primarily driven by carbon
chemistry: CO is energetically favored on the dayside, while CH4 is favored on
the cooler nightside. Infrared opacity therefore changes by orders of magnitude
between day and night, producing dramatic vertical shifts in the
wavelength-specific photospheres, which would complicate eclipse or phase
mapping with spectral data. The model predicts greater relative phase amplitude
and greater phase offset at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, in agreement with
the data. Our model qualitatively explains the observed phase curves, but is in
tension with current thermo-chemical kinetics models that predict zonally
uniform atmospheric composition due to transport of CO from the hot regions of
the atmosphere.

equilibrium and surface conditions of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key
to assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous modeling of the impact of
electromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an
Earth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in
ozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more
realistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law distribution of
energies. Here we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model
to investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and
surface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field.
We use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM3 star AD Leo, combined
with flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 10$^{30.5}$ to
10$^{34}$ erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star
GJ1243. Our model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on
the ozone column depth, but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the
ozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with
nominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet
can be depleted by 94% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery
unlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O3
depletion allows a constant 0.1-1 W m$^{-2}$ of UV-C at the planet's surface,
which is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results suggest that
active M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the
surface of magnetically-unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation
that can damage complex organic structures. However, this does not preclude
habitability, as a safe haven for life could still exist below an ocean
surface.

consider an alternative formulation of Abelian T-duality on GLSM's as a gauging
of a global $U(1)$ symmetry with the addition of appropriate Lagrange
multipliers. For GLSMs with Abelian gauge groups and without superpotential we
reproduce the dual models introduced by Hori and Vafa. We extend the
construction to formulate non-Abelian T-duality on GLSMs with global
non-Abelian symmetries. The equations of motion that lead to the dual model are
obtained for a general group, they depend in general on semi-chiral
superfields; for cases such as $SU(2)$ they depend on twisted chiral
superfields. We solve the equations of motion for an $SU(2)$ gauged group with
a choice of a particular Lie algebra direction of the vector superfield. This
direction covers a non-Abelian sector that can be described by a family of
Abelian dualities. The dual model Lagrangian depends on twisted chiral
superfields and a twisted superpotential is generated. We explore some
non-perturbative aspects by making an Ansatz for the instanton corrections in
the dual theories. We verify that the effective potential for the $U(1)$ field
strength in a fixed configuration on the original theory matches the one of the
dual theory. Imposing restrictions on the vector superfield, more general
non-Abelian dual models are obtained. We analyze the dual models via the
geometry of their susy vacua.

driven towards chemical equilibrium on a prescribed chemical timescale, but it
has surprisingly never been validated. First, we generalize the treatment by
forgoing the use of a single chemical timescale, instead developing a pathway
analysis tool that allows us to identify the rate-limiting reaction as a
function of temperature and pressure. For the interconversion between methane
and carbon monoxide and between ammonia, and molecular nitrogen, we identify
the key rate-limiting reactions for conditions relevant to currently
characterizable exo-atmospheres (500-3000 K, 0.1 mbar to 1 kbar). Second, we
extend chemical relaxation to include carbon dioxide and water. Third, we
examine the role of metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio in chemical
relaxation. Fourth, we apply our pathway analysis tool to diagnose the
differences between our chemical network and that of Moses and Venot. Finally,
we validate the chemical relaxation method against full chemical kinetics

maximal independent set. On a graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices, this
takes $\tilde O(\log^2 n)$ time and $(m + n) n^{o(1)}$ processors, nearly
matching the best randomized parallel algorithms. Other applications include
reduced processor counts for algorithms of Berger (1997) for maximum acyclic
subgraph and Gale-Berlekamp switching games.
  This bilinear factorization also gives better algorithms for problems
involving discrepancy. An important application of this is to automata-fooling
probability spaces, which are the basis of a notable derandomization technique
of Sivakumar (2002). Our method leads to large reduction in processor
complexity for a number of derandomization algorithms based on
automata-fooling, including set discrepancy and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
Lemma.

encodes them on a weak coherent pulse using optical amplitude and phase
modulators, and then transmits the Gaussian-modulated weak coherent pulse to
Bob. Here we propose a \emph{passive} state preparation scheme using a thermal
source. In our scheme, Alice splits the output of a thermal source into two
spatial modes using a beam splitter. She measures one mode locally using
conjugate optical homodyne detectors, and transmits the other mode to Bob after
applying appropriate optical attenuation. Under normal conditions, Alice's
measurement results are correlated to Bob's, and they can work out a secure
key, as in the active state preparation scheme. Given the initial thermal state
generated by the source is strong enough, this scheme can tolerate high
detector noise at Alice's side. Furthermore, the output of the source does not
need to be single mode, since an optical homodyne detector can selectively
measure a single mode determined by the local oscillator. Preliminary
experimental results suggest that the proposed scheme could be implemented
using an off-the-shelf amplified spontaneous emission source.

recently emerged as they are shown to be promising candidates for magnetic
storage media, magneto-resistive sensors, and personalized medical treatment.
As these artificial materials show large differences in properties compared to
conventional ones, many experimental and theoretical works have been dedicated
on shedding light on these differences and tremendous results have emerged.
However, little is known how the interfaces influence the structure of the
layers around them. By a numerical approach, we show that the structure of each
layer depends on its thickness and the interface morphology. The Fe and Cu
layers can adopt either the body-centered-cubic (bcc) or face-centered-cubic
(fcc) structure, while the interface can assume amorphous, bcc, fcc, or a
mixture of bcc and fcc structures depending on the layer thicknesses. These
results are in good agreement with the experiments. They could be helpful in
understanding effects such as giant magneto-resistance from the structural
viewpoint.

energy-conserving code for reflection and reprocessing from cold media. We show
that a static corona above a disc extending to the innermost stable circular
orbit produces spectra not compatible with those observed. They are either too
soft or require a much higher disc ionization than that observed. This
conclusion confirms a number of previous findings, but disproves a recent study
claiming an agreement of that model with observations. We show that the cold
disc has to be truncated in order to agree with the observed spectral hardness.
However, a cold disc truncated at a large radius and replaced by a hot flow
produces spectra which are too hard if the only source of seed photons for
Comptonization is the accretion disc. Our favourable geometry is a truncated
disc coexisting with a hot plasma either overlapping with the disc or
containing some cold matter within it, also including seed photons arising from
cyclo-synchrotron emission of hybrid electrons, i.e. containing both thermal
and non-thermal parts.

derived from the argument of Pomeau which includes the assumption of the
dominance, at large enough times, of small landing regions into each of which
only a single particle can be deposited without overlapping earlier deposited
particles and which, after a certain time are no longer created by depositions
in larger gaps. The second assumption has been that the size distribution of
gaps open for particle-center landing in this large-time small-gaps regime is
finite in the limit of zero gap size. We report numerical Monte Carlo studies
of a recently introduced model of random sequential adsorption on patterned
one-dimensional substrates that suggest that the second assumption must be
generalized. We argue that a region exists in the parameter space of the
studied model in which the gap-size distribution in the Pomeau large-time
regime actually linearly vanishes at zero gap sizes. In another region, the
distribution develops a threshold property, i.e., there are no small gaps below
a certain gap size. We discuss the implications of these findings for new

a generalized Anderson-Hubbard Hamiltonian that accounts for both randomly

the material. Second, we parameterize this energy-dependent Hamiltonian from
first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and the Green
function and screened Coulomb (GW) method. Third, we apply a
first-principles-based many-body typical medium method to determine the
single-particle electronic structure. Fourth, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter
equation to obtain the charge susceptibility $\chi$ with its imaginary part
being related to the absorbance $\mathcal{A}$. Our results show that an
increased vacancy concentration leads to decreased absorption both in the band
continuum and from exciton states within the band gap. We also observe
increased absorption below the band gap threshold and present an expression,
which describes Lifshitz tails, in excellent qualitative agreement with our
numerical calculations. This latter increased absorption in the
$1.0$--$2.5$\,eV makes defect engineering of potential interest for solar cell
applications.

precise characterizations of variability in Mercury-Manganese (HgMn/CP3) stars,
which might advance our understanding of their internal structure. We have
carried out a spectroscopic and photometric investigation of the candidate CP3
star KIC 6128830. A detailed abundance analysis based on newly-acquired
high-resolution spectra was performed, which confirms that the star's abundance
pattern is fully consistent with its proposed classification. Photometric
variability was investigated using four years of archival Kepler data. In
agreement with results from the literature, we have identified a single
significant and independent frequency $f_1$=0.2065424 d$^{-1}$ with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of $\sim$3.4 mmag and harmonic frequencies up to $5f_1$.
Drawing on the predictions of state-of-the-art pulsation models and information
on evolutionary status, we discuss the origin of the observed light changes.
Our calculations predict the occurrence of g-mode pulsations at the observed
variability frequency. On the other hand, the strictly mono-periodic nature of
the variability strongly suggests a rotational origin. While we prefer the
rotational explanation, the present data leave some uncertainty.

  section II, and discussions on electromagnetic responses in Section IV",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The particle-hole (PH) symmetry at half-filled Landau level requires the
relationship between the flux number N_phi and the particle number N on a
sphere to be exactly N_phi - 2(N-1) = 1. The wave functions of composite
fermions with 1/2 ""orbital spin"", which contributes to the shift ""1"" in the
N_phi and N relationship, are proposed, shown to be PH symmetric, and validated
with exact finite system results. It is shown the many-body composite electron
and composite hole wave functions at half-filling can be formed from the two
components of the same spinor wave function of a massless Dirac fermion at
zero-magnetic field. It is further shown that away from half-filling, the
many-body composite electron wave function at filling factor nu and its PH
conjugated composite hole wave function at 1-nu can be formed from the two
components of the very same spinor wave functions of a massless Dirac fermion
at non-zero magnetic field. This relationship leads to the proposal of a very
simple Dirac composite fermion effective field theory, where the two-component
Dirac fermion field is a particle-hole spinor field coupled to the same
emergent gauge field, with one field component describing the composite
electrons and the other describing the PH conjugated composite holes. As such,
the density of the Dirac spinor field is the density sum of the composite
electron and hole field components, and therefore is equal to the degeneracy of
the Lowest Landau level. On the other hand, the charge density coupled to the
external magnetic field is the density difference between the composite
electron and hole field components, and is therefore neutral at exactly
half-filling. It is shown that the proposed particle-hole spinor effective
field theory gives essentially the same electromagnetic responses as Son's
Dirac composite fermion theory does.

that the connection between the 4-D isotropic harmonic oscillator and the

both bilinear functions among the variables. We will show that an alternative

another integral of the system including them among a new set of variables that
allows to connect the 4-D isotropic harmonic oscillator and the planar Kepler

classes modulo $q$, assuming the standard conjectures GRH and LI.
  We show that provided $n/\log q \rightarrow \infty$ as $q \rightarrow
\infty$, we can find $n$ competitor classes modulo $q$ so that the
corresponding $n$-way prime number race is extremely biased. This improves on
the previous range $n \geq \varphi(q)^{\epsilon}$, and (together with an
existing result of Harper and Lamzouri) establishes that the transition from
all $n$-way races being asymptotically unbiased, to biased races existing,
occurs when $n = \log^{1+o(1)}q$.
  The proofs involve finding biases in certain auxiliary races that are easier
to analyse than a full $n$-way race. An important ingredient is a quantitative,
moderate deviation, multi-dimensional Gaussian approximation theorem, which we
prove using a Lindeberg type method.

modes can exist simultaneously in a CM cylinder with an extremely large size,
where the excitations of CPA and laser modes depend on the angular momentum of
coherent incident light. Therefore, compared with the well known parity time
symmetry, our work opens up a brand-new path to obtaining CPA and laser modes,
and is a significant advance in non-Hermitian optical systems.

in solar-type stars. This study requires at least a 2D description to capture
the latitudinal variations of the differential rotation. We build 2D numerical
models of a radiative core on the top of which we impose a latitudinal shear so
as to reproduce a cylindrical differential rotation in a convective envelope.
We perform a systematic study over the Rossby number measuring the latitudinal
differential rotation at the radiative-convective interface. The imposed shear
generates a geostrophic flow implying a cylindrical differential rotation. When
compared to the baroclinic flow that arises from the stable stratification, we
find that the geostrophic flow is dominant when the Rossby number is high
enough with a cylindrical rotation profile. For low Rossby numbers, the
baroclinic solution dominates with a quasi-shellular rotation profile. Using
scaling laws from 3D simulations, we show that slow rotators are expected to
have a cylindrical rotation profile. Fast rotators may have a shellular profile
at the beginning of the main-sequence in stellar radiative zones. This study
enables us to predict different types of differential rotation and emphasizes
the need of a new generation of 2D rotating stellar models developed in synergy
with 3D numerical simulations. The shear induced by a surface convective zone
has a strong impact on the dynamics of the underlying radiative zone in
low-mass stars. But, it cannot produce a flat internal rotation profile in a

that a large valley splitting can be obtained in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides by magnetic proximity coupling to an insulating
antiferromagnetic substrate. As an example, we perform first-principles
calculations to investigate the electronic structures of monolayer WS$_2$ on
the MnO(111) surface. Our calculation results suggest that a large valley
splitting of 214 meV, which corresponds to a Zeeman magnetic field of 1516 T,
is induced in the valence band of monolayer WS$_2$. The magnitude of valley
splitting relies on the strength of interfacial orbital hybridization, and can
be continually tuned by applying an external out-of-plane pressure and in-plane
strain. More interestingly, we find that both spin and valley index will flip
when the magnetic ordering of MnO is reversed. Besides, owing to the sizeable
Berry curvature and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the WS$_2$/MnO
heterostructure, a spin and valley polarized anomalous Hall current can be
generated in the presence of an in-plane electric field, which allow one to
detect valleys by the electrical approach. Our results shed light on the

in the wavelength range around the period of the arrays, the plasmonic lattice

wavelength-dependent diffracted waves generated by the periodic arrays and the

Increasing the height of SiO2 nanopillars can weaken the near-field coupling
between Ag nanospheres and the quartz substrates, and lead to the greater

the triple-$q$ CDW state is thus examined to show that the transverse phonon

introduce the intersite Coulomb interactions between the nearest-neighbor Ti

remodelling, age-related bone loss, and tissue engineering. However, how
exactly geometry influences the behaviour of bone-forming cells remains
elusive. Geometry modulates cell populations collectively through the evolving
space available to the cells, but it may also modulate the individual
behaviours of cells. To factor out the collective influence of geometry and
gain access to the geometric regulation of individual cell behaviours, we
develop a mathematical model of the infilling of cortical bone pores and use it
with available experimental data on cortical infilling rates. Testing different
possible modes of geometric controls of individual cell behaviours consistent
with the experimental data, we find that efficient smoothing of irregular pores
only occurs when cell secretory rate is controlled by porosity rather than
curvature. This porosity control suggests the convergence of a large scale of
intercellular signalling to single bone-forming cells, consistent with that
provided by the osteocyte network in response to mechanical stimulus. After
validating the mathematical model with the histological record of a real
cortical pore infilling, we explore the infilling of a population of randomly
generated initial pore shapes. We find that amongst all the geometric
regulations considered, the collective influence of curvature on cell crowding
is a dominant factor for how fast cortical bone pores infill, and we suggest
that the irregularity of cement lines thereby explains some of the variability
in double labelling data as well as the overall speed of osteon infilling.

devices. In addition, the characteristics are often confounded by substrate
induced trap effects. Here we report multi-layer SnSe2 based photoconductive
devices using two different structures: (1) SiO2 substrate supported

exhibits a responsivity of ~ 10^3 A/W and 8.66x10^4 A/W at operating voltages
of 1 mV and 100 mV, respectively - a superior low voltage performance over
existing literature on planar 2D structures. However, the responsivity reduces

classifiers for the target samples. In particular, it was shown that a GAN
objective function can be used to learn target features indistinguishable from
the source ones. In this work, we extend this framework by (i) forcing the
learned feature extractor to be domain-invariant, and (ii) training it through
data augmentation in the feature space, namely performing feature augmentation.
While data augmentation in the image space is a well established technique in
deep learning, feature augmentation has not yet received the same level of
attention. We accomplish it by means of a feature generator trained by playing
the GAN minimax game against source features. Results show that both enforcing
domain-invariance and performing feature augmentation lead to superior or
comparable performance to state-of-the-art results in several unsupervised

meet the fast growing demand for large capacity memory in computer systems,
replacing DRAM that is impeded by physical limitations. Multi-level cell (MLC)
PCM offers high density with low per-byte fabrication cost. However, despite
many advantages, such as scalability and low leakage, the energy for
programming intermediate states is considerably larger than programing
single-level cell PCM. In this paper, we study encoding techniques to reduce
write energy for MLC PCM when the encoding granularity is lowered below the
typical cache line size. We observe that encoding data blocks at small
granularity to reduce write energy actually increases the write energy because
of the auxiliary encoding bits. We mitigate this adverse effect by 1) designing
suitable codeword mappings that use fewer auxiliary bits and 2) proposing a new
Word-Level Compression (WLC) which compresses more than 91% of the memory lines
and provides enough room to store the auxiliary data using a novel restricted
coset encoding applied at small data block granularities.
  Experimental results show that the proposed encoding at 16-bit data
granularity reduces the write energy by 39%, on average, versus the leading
encoding approach for write energy reduction. Furthermore, it improves
endurance by 20% and is more reliable than the leading approach. Hardware
synthesis evaluation shows that the proposed encoding can be implemented
on-chip with only a nominal area overhead.

gravitational wave (GW) signals from a low mass compact binary merger GW170817,
which is most likely due to a double neutron star (NS) merger. With the GW
signals only, the chirp mass of the binary is precisely constrained to
$1.188^{+0.004}_{-0.002}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$, but the mass ratio is loosely
constrained in the range $0.4-1$, so that a very rough estimation of the

$1.36~{\rm M_{\odot}}<M_2<2.26~\rm{M_{\odot}}$) was obtained. Here we propose
that if one can constrain the dynamical ejecta mass through performing kilonova
modeling of the optical/IR data, by utilizing an empirical relation between the
dynamical ejecta mass and the mass ratio of NS binaries, one may place a more
stringent constraint on the mass ratio of the system. For instance, considering
that the red ""kilonova"" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, we reach
a tight constraint on the mass ratio in the range of $0.46-0.59$.
Alternatively, if the blue ""kilonova"" component is powered by the dynamical
ejecta, the mass ratio would be constrained in the range of $0.53-0.67$.
Overall, such a multi-messenger approach could narrow down the mass ratio of
GW170817 system to the range of $0.46-0.67$, which gives a more precise
estimation of the individual NS mass than pure GW signal analysis, i.e.

for 2D image analysis, it is still challenging to apply them to 3D anisotropic

between-slice resolution and when the amount of 3D volumes is relatively small.
On one hand, direct learning of CNN with 3D convolution kernels suffers from
the lack of data and likely ends up with poor generalization; insufficient GPU
memory limits the model size or representational power. On the other hand,
applying 2D CNN with generalizable features to 2D slices ignores between-slice

the above challenges, we propose a 3D Anisotropic Hybrid Network (AH-Net) that
transfers convolutional features learned from 2D images to 3D anisotropic

for within-slice information while naturally exploiting between-slice
information for more effective modelling. The focal loss is further utilized
for more effective end-to-end learning. We experiment with the proposed 3D

different states of the flare during MJD 57530 - 57589 using simultaneous
multiwaveband data to understand the possible broadband emission scenario
during the flare. Methods : The UV/optical and X-ray data from UVOT and XRT
respectively on board Swift and high energy $\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT
are used to generate multiwaveband lightcurves as well as to obtain high flux
states and quiescent state SEDs. The correlation and lag between different
energy bands is quantified using discrete correlation function. The synchrotron
self Compton (SSC) model was used to reproduce the observed SEDs during flaring
and quiescent states of the source. Results : A decent correlation is seen
between X-ray and high energy $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The spectral hardening with
increase in the flux is seen in X-ray band. The powerlaw index vs flux plot in
$\gamma$-ray band indicates the different emission regions for 0.1 - 3 GeV and
3-300 GeV energy photons. Two zone SSC model satisfactorily fits the observed
broadband SEDs. The inner zone is mainly responsible for producing synchrotron
peak and high energy $\gamma$-ray part of the SED in all states. The second
zone is mainly required to produce less variable optical/UV and low energy
$\gamma$-ray emission. Conclusions : Conventional single zone SSC model does
not satisfactorily explain broadband emission during observation period
considered. There is an indication of two emission zones in the jet which are
responsible for producing broadband emission from optical to high energy
$\gamma$-rays.

shown the effectiveness of dividing the task of 3D pose estimation into two
steps: using a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimator to estimate the 2D pose from
images and then mapping them into 3D space. They also showed that a
low-dimensional representation like 2D locations of a set of joints can be
discriminative enough to estimate 3D pose with high accuracy. However,
estimation of 3D pose for individual frames leads to temporally incoherent
estimates due to independent error in each frame causing jitter. Therefore, in
this work we utilize the temporal information across a sequence of 2D joint
locations to estimate a sequence of 3D poses. We designed a
sequence-to-sequence network composed of layer-normalized LSTM units with
shortcut connections connecting the input to the output on the decoder side and
imposed temporal smoothness constraint during training. We found that the
knowledge of temporal consistency improves the best reported result on
Human3.6M dataset by approximately $12.2\%$ and helps our network to recover
temporally consistent 3D poses over a sequence of images even when the 2D pose
detector fails.

deep neural networks. We cast the proposed approach in the form of regular
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) weight layers using a decorrelation
transform with fixed basis functions. Our spectral dropout method prevents
overfitting by eliminating weak and `noisy' Fourier domain coefficients of the
neural network activations, leading to remarkably better results than the
current regularization methods. Furthermore, the proposed is very efficient due
to the fixed basis functions used for spectral transformation. In particular,
compared to Dropout and Drop-Connect, our method significantly speeds up the
network convergence rate during the training process (roughly x2), with
considerably higher neuron pruning rates (an increase of ~ 30%). We demonstrate
that the spectral dropout can also be used in conjunction with other
regularization approaches resulting in additional performance gains.

fundamental bands, located at 660 and 500 cm$^{-1}$, respectively, and their
associated hot bands. Pure rotational transitions in the ground and
vibrationally excited states have been recorded in the millimetre and
sub-millimetre regions in order to extend the frequency range so far considered
in previous investigations. All the transitions from the literature and from
this work involving energy levels lower than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ have been fitted
together to an effective Hamiltonian. Because of the presence of various
anharmonic resonances, the Hamiltonian includes a number of interaction
constants, in addition to the conventional rotational and vibrational l-type
resonance terms. The data set contains about 3400 ro-vibrational lines of 13
bands and some 1500 pure rotational lines belonging to 12 vibrational states.
More than 120 spectroscopic constants have been determined directly from the
fit, without any assumption deduced from theoretical calculations or

distribution is factorized into an autoregressive product of one-dimensional
conditional distributions according to the chain rule. Data completion is a
more involved task than data generation: the model must infer missing variables
for any partially observed input vector. Previous work introduced an
order-agnostic training procedure for data completion with autoregressive
models. Missing variables in any partially observed input vector can be imputed
efficiently by choosing an ordering where observed dimensions precede
unobserved ones and by computing the autoregressive product in this order. In
this paper, we provide evidence that the order-agnostic (OA) training procedure
is suboptimal for data completion. We propose an alternative procedure (OA++)
that reaches better performance in fewer computations. It can handle all data
completion queries while training fewer one-dimensional conditional
distributions than the OA procedure. In addition, these one-dimensional
conditional distributions are trained proportionally to their expected usage at
inference time, reducing overfitting. Finally, our OA++ procedure can exploit
prior knowledge about the distribution of inference completion queries, as

A robust time-warping algorithm which synchronizes two singing recordings can
provide a promising solution. We thereby propose to address the problem by
canonical time warping (CTW) which aligns amateur singing recordings to
professional ones. A new pitch contour is generated given the alignment
information, and a pitch-corrected singing is synthesized back through the
vocoder. The objective evaluation shows that CTW is robust against
pitch-shifting and time-stretching effects, and the subjective test
demonstrates that CTW prevails the other methods including DTW and the

originated for the goal of positive frequency representations of signals. It
achieved the goal and at the same time offered fast decompositions of signals.
There then arose several types of AFDs. AFD merged with the greedy algorithm
idea, and in particular, motivated the so-called pre-orthogonal greedy
algorithm (Pre-OGA) that was proven to be the most efficient greedy algorithm.
The cost of the advantages of the AFD type decompositions is, however, the high
computational complexity due to the involvement of maximal selections of the
dictionary parameters. The present paper offers one formulation of the 1-D AFD
algorithm by building the FFT algorithm into it. Accordingly, the algorithm
complexity is reduced, from the original $\mathcal{O}(M N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(M

areas in natural language processing (NLP) and text classifications. This
technique has become an essential part of a wide range of applications
including politics, business, advertising and marketing. There are various
techniques for sentiment analysis, but recently word embeddings methods have
been widely used in sentiment classification tasks. Word2Vec and GloVe are
currently among the most accurate and usable word embedding methods which can
convert words into meaningful vectors. However, these methods ignore sentiment
information of texts and need a huge corpus of texts for training and
generating exact vectors which are used as inputs of deep learning models. As a
result, because of the small size of some corpuses, researcher often have to
use pre-trained word embeddings which were trained on other large text corpus
such as Google News with about 100 billion words. The increasing accuracy of
pre-trained word embeddings has a great impact on sentiment analysis research.
In this paper we propose a novel method, Improved Word Vectors (IWV), which
increases the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings in sentiment analysis.
Our method is based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging techniques, lexicon-based
approaches and Word2Vec/GloVe methods. We tested the accuracy of our method via
different deep learning models and sentiment datasets. Our experiment results
show that Improved Word Vectors (IWV) are very effective for sentiment

speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, there have been few positive results of deep models on ad-hoc
retrieval tasks. This is partially due to the fact that many important
characteristics of the ad-hoc retrieval task have not been well addressed in
deep models yet. Typically, the ad-hoc retrieval task is formalized as a
matching problem between two pieces of text in existing work using deep models,
and treated equivalent to many NLP tasks such as paraphrase identification,
question answering and automatic conversation. However, we argue that the
ad-hoc retrieval task is mainly about relevance matching while most NLP
matching tasks concern semantic matching, and there are some fundamental
differences between these two matching tasks. Successful relevance matching
requires proper handling of the exact matching signals, query term importance,
and diverse matching requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
relevance matching model (DRMM) for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically, our model
employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level for relevance
matching. By using matching histogram mapping, a feed forward matching network,
and a term gating network, we can effectively deal with the three relevance
matching factors mentioned above. Experimental results on two representative
benchmark collections show that our model can significantly outperform some
well-known retrieval models as well as state-of-the-art deep matching models.

As online social networks have become significant sources of information for

harnessing social influence, for example, by spreading fake news and other

  We consider the computational problem of election control via social

probability and margin of victory (POV and MOV, respectively). We present

constraints on the parton (quark/antiquark) fragmentation functions. We find
that already a fraction of $q/{\bar q} \to D$ fragmentation probability is
sufficient to account for the measured asymmetry. We make predictions for
similar asymmetry for neutral $D$ mesons. Large $D$-meson production
asymmetries are found for large $x_F$ which is related to dominance of light
quark/antiquark $q/\bar q \to D$ fragmentation over the standard $c \to D$
fragmentation. As a consequence, prompt atmospheric neutrino flux at high
neutrino energies can be much larger than for the conventional $c \to D$
fragmentation. The latter can constitute a sizeable background for the cosmic
neutrinos claimed to be observed recently by the IceCube Observatory. Large
rapidity-dependent $D^+/D^-$ and $D^0/{\bar D}^0$ asymmetries are predicted for
low ($\sqrt{s} =$ 20 - 100 GeV) energies. The $q/\bar q \to D$ fragmentation
leads to enhanced production of $D$ mesons at low energies. At $\sqrt{s}$ = 20
GeV the enhancement factor with respect to the conventional contribution is
larger than a factor of five. In the considered picture the large-$x_F$ $D$
mesons are produced dominantly via fragmentation of light quarks/antiquarks.

between spins and systems carry XXX Heisenberg interaction. By tuning the
coupling distance $R$, temperature and magnetic field quantum correlations can
be scaled in the bipartite system. We find the long sustainable behaviour of
quantum discord in comparison to entanglement over the coupling distance $R$.
We also investigate the situations, where entanglement totally dies but quantum
discord exist in the system. The present findings in the letter may be useful
for designing quantum wires, data bus, solid state gates and quantum

amorphous materials or glasses as thermal insulators. It has thus come as a
surprise that certain crystal structures defy this paradigm. A prominent
example are type-I clathrates and other materials with guest-host structures.
They sustain low-energy Einstein-like modes in their phonon spectra, but are
also prone to various types of disorder and phonon-electron scattering and thus
the mechanism responsible for their ultralow thermal conductivities has
remained elusive. While recent ab initio lattice dynamics simulations show that
the Einstein-like modes enhance phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering, they
reproduce experimental data only at low temperatures. Here we show that a new
effect, an ""all phononic Kondo effect"", can resolve this discrepancy. This is
evidenced by our thermodynamic and transport measurements on various clathrate
single crystal series and their comparison with ab initio simulations. Our new
understanding devises design strategies to further suppress the thermal
conductivity of clathrates and other related materials classes, with relevance
for the field of thermoelectric waste heat recovery but also more generally for
phononic applications. More fundamentally, it may trigger theoretical work on
strong correlation effects in phonon systems.

to the incompatibility of the gyrotropic order with any phonon mode at the

have only an electronic origin. Through magnetic susceptibility and previously

anisotropy has thermal variation, due to which orientation of rare earth

reconfiguration of magnetic fields, but their origin is still unclear. We
carried out a statistical analysis of permanent line-of-sight magnetic field
($B_{\rm LOS}$) changes during 18 X-, 37 M-, 19 C- and 1 B-class flares using
data from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We
investigated the properties of permanent changes, such as frequency, areas, and
locations. We detected changes of $B_{\rm LOS}$ in 59/75 flares. We find that
strong flares are more likely to show changes, with all flares $\ge$ M1.6
exhibiting them. For weaker flares, permanent changes are observed in 6/17
C-flares. 34.3\% of the permanent changes occurred in the penumbra and 18.9\%
in the umbra. Parts of the penumbra appeared or disappeared in 23/75 flares.
The area where permanent changes occur is larger for stronger flares. Strong
flares also show a larger change of flux, but there is no dependence of the
magnetic flux change on the heliocentric angle. The mean rate of change of
flare-related magnetic field changes is 20.7 Mx cm$^{-2}$ min$^{-1}$. The
number of permanent changes decays exponentially with distance from the
polarity inversion line. The frequency of the strength of permanent changes
decreases exponentially, and permanent changes up to 750 Mx cm$^{-2}$ were
observed. We conclude that permanent magnetic field changes are a common
phenomenon during flares, and future studies will clarify their relation to
accelerated electrons, white light emission, and sunquakes to further
investigate their origin.

analytic expressions of the error exponent when the length of the codeword

Analyzing its behavior at rates close to the ergodic rate, we find that the
Gallager error bound becomes asymptotically close to an upper error bound
obtained recently by Hoydis et al. 2015. We also obtain an expression for the
Gallager exponent in the case when the codelength spans several Rayleigh fading

over this time period. The spin-down of these stars is controlled by
interactions between stellar winds and magnetic fields, thus magnetic evolution
in turn plays an important role in rotational evolution. We present here the
second part of a study investigating the evolution of large-scale surface
magnetic fields in this critical time period. We observed stars in open
clusters and stellar associations with known ages between 120 and 650 Myr, and
used spectropolarimetry and Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterize their
large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry. We report 15 stars with
magnetic detections here. These stars have masses from 0.8 to 0.95 Msun,
rotation periods from 0.326 to 10.6 days, and we find large-scale magnetic
field strengths from 8.5 to 195 G with a wide range of geometries. We find a
clear trend towards decreasing magnetic field strength with age, and a
power-law decrease in magnetic field strength with Rossby number. There is some
tentative evidence for saturation of the large-scale magnetic field strength at
Rossby numbers below 0.1, although the saturation point is not yet well
defined. Comparing to younger classical T Tauri stars, we support the
hypothesis that differences in internal structure produce large differences in
observed magnetic fields, however for weak lined T Tauri stars this is less
clear.

$\simeq50$ minutes with 99% significance levels is confirmed by ZDCF method,
Lomb-Scargle method, REDFIT and fitting sinusoidal curves. The observed QPO is
likely to be explained by accretion disk variability. If the observed QPO
indicates an innermost stable orbital period from the accretion disk, the QPO
$\simeq50$ min corresponds to a black hole mass of $5.03\times10^6 M_\odot$ for
a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole and $3.2\times10^7 M_\odot$ for a

based on noisy data by using $\ell^1$-regularization as a sparsity-enforcing
version of Tikhonov regularization. We summarize recent results on situations
where the sparsity of the solution slightly fails. In particular, we show how
the recently established theory for weak*-to-weak continuous linear forward
operators can be extended to the case of weak*-to-weak* continuity. This might
be of interest when the image space is non-reflexive. We discuss existence,
stability and convergence of regularized solutions. For injective operators, we
will formulate convergence rates by exploiting variational source conditions.
The typical rate function obtained under an ill-posed operator is strictly
concave and the degree of failure of the solution sparsity has an impact on its
behavior. Linear convergence rates just occur in the two borderline cases of
proper sparsity, where the solutions belong to $\ell^0$, and of well-posedness.
For an exemplary operator, we demonstrate that the technical properties used in
our theory can be verified in practice. In the last section, we briefly mention
the difficult case of oversmoothing regularization where $x^\dag$ does not
belong to $\ell^1$.

interactions. In long-term photometric monitoring of the accreting T Tauri star
GI Tau, we detect extinction events with typical depths of $\Delta V \sim 2.5$
mag that last for days-to-months and often appear to occur stochastically. In
2014 - 2015, extinctions that repeated with a quasi-period of 21 days over
several months is the first empirical evidence of slow warps predicted from MHD
simulations to form at a few stellar radii away from the central star. The
reddening is consistent with $R_V=3.85\pm0.5$ and, along with an absence of
diffuse interstellar bands, indicates that some dust processing has occurred in
the disk. The 2015 -- 2016 multi-band lightcurve includes variations in spot
coverage, extinction, and accretion, each of which results in different traces
in color-magnitude diagrams. This lightcurve is initially dominated by a
month-long extinction event and return to the unocculted brightness. The
subsequent light-curve then features spot modulation with a 7.03 day period,
punctuated by brief, randomly-spaced extinction events. The accretion rate
measured from $U$-band photometry ranges from $1.3\times10^{-8}$ to
$1.1\times10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (excluding the highest and lowest 5% of

scalable and reliable control plane of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).
However, it brings a new challenge for balancing loads on the distributed
controllers as the network traffic dynamically changes. The unbalanced load
distribution on the controllers will increase response delay for processing
flows and reduce the controllers'throughput. Switch migration is an effective
approach to solve the problem. However, existing schemes focus only on the load
balancing performance but ignore migration efficiency, which may result in high
migration costs and unnecessary control overheads. This paper proposes
Efficiency-Aware Switch Migration (EASM) to balance the controllers'loads and
improve migration efficiency. We introduce load difference matrix and trigger
factor to measure load balancing on controllers. We also introduce the
migration efficiency problem, which considers load balancing rate and migration
cost simultaneously to optimally migrate switches. We propose EASM to
efficiently solve to the problem. The simulation results show that EASM
outperforms baseline schemes by reducing the controller response time by about
21.9%, improving the controller throughput by 30.4% on average, maintaining
good load balancing rate, low migration costs and migration time, when the
network scale changes.

energy (APE) from a local principle has been known for some time, but has
received very little attention so far. Yet, the local APE framework offers the
advantage of providing a positive definite local form of potential energy,
which like kinetic energy can be transported, converted, and created/dissipated
locally. In contrast to Lorenz's definition, which relies on the exact from of
potential energy, the local APE theory uses the particular form of potential
energy appropriate to the approximations considered. In this paper, this idea
is illustrated for the dry hydrostatic primitive equations, whose relevant form
of potential energy is the specific enthalpy. The local APE density is
non-quadratic in general, but can nevertheless be partitioned exactly into mean
and eddy components regardless of the Reynolds averaging operator used.
  This paper introduces a new form of the local APE that is easily computable
from atmospheric datasets. The advantages of using the local APE over the
classical Lorenz APE are highlighted. The paper also presents the first
calculation of the three-dimensional local APE in observation-based atmospheric
data. Finally, it illustrates how the eddy and mean components of the local APE
can be used to study regional and temporal variability in the large-scale
circulation. It is revealed that advection from high latitudes is necessary to
supply APE into the storm track regions, and that Greenland and Ross Sea, which
have suffered from rapid land ice and sea ice loss in recent decades, are
particularly susceptible to APE variability.

novel Visual Grounding Model (VGM) to implicitly and efficiently predict the
NFoVs given the video content and subtitles. Specifically, at each frame, we
efficiently encode the panorama into feature map of candidate NFoVs using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the subtitles to the same hidden space
using an RNN with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Then, we apply soft-attention on
candidate NFoVs to trigger sentence decoder aiming to minimize the reconstruct
loss between the generated and given sentence. Finally, we obtain the NFoV as
the candidate NFoV with the maximum attention without any human supervision. To
train VGM more robustly, we also generate a reverse sentence conditioning on
one minus the soft-attention such that the attention focuses on candidate NFoVs
less relevant to the given sentence. The negative log reconstruction loss of
the reverse sentence (referred to as ""irrelevant loss"") is jointly minimized to
encourage the reverse sentence to be different from the given sentence. To
evaluate our method, we collect the first narrated 360{\deg} videos dataset and
achieve state-of-the-art NFoV-grounding performance.

in the context of the Large Interstellar Polarisation Survey (LIPS) towards 59
sight-lines in the Southern Hemisphere, and we fit these data using a dust
model composed of silicate and carbon particles with sizes from the molecular

for the observed polarisation. For 32 sight-lines we complement our data set
with UVES archive high-resolution spectra, which enable us to establish the
presence of single-cloud or multiple-clouds towards individual sight-lines. We
find that the majority of these 35 sight-lines intersect two or more clouds,
while eight of them are dominated by a single absorbing cloud. We confirm
several correlations between extinction and parameters of the Serkowski law
with dust parameters, but we also find previously undetected correlations
between these parameters that are valid only in single-cloud sight-lines. We
find that interstellar polarisation from multiple-clouds is smaller than from
single-cloud sight-lines, showing that the presence of a second or more clouds
depolarises the incoming radiation. We find large variations of the dust
characteristics from cloud-to-cloud. However, when we average a sufficiently
large number of clouds in single-cloud or multiple-cloud sight-lines, we always

epistemic restriction, a constraint on what the observer can know about the
reality. It has been shown in [3] that for qudits of odd dimensions it is
operationally equivalent to stabiliser quantum mechanics by making use of
Gross' theory of discrete Wigner functions. This result does not hold in the
case of qubits, because of the unavoidable negativity of any Wigner function
representation of qubit stabiliser quantum mechanics. In this work we define
and characterise the subtheories of Spekkens' theory that are operationally
equivalent to subtheories of stabiliser quantum mechanics. We use these
Spekkens' subtheories as a unifying framework for the known examples of
state-injection schemes where contextuality is an injected resource to reach
universal quantum computation. In addition, we prove that, in the case of
qubits, stabiliser quantum mechanics can be reduced to a Spekkens' subtheory in
the sense that all its objects that do not belong to the Spekkens' subtheory,
namely non-covariant Clifford gates, can be injected. This shows that within
Spekkens' subtheories we possess the toolbox to perform state-injection of
every object outside of them and it suggests that there is no need to use
bigger subtheories to reach universal quantum computation via state-injection.
We conclude with a novel scheme of computation suggested by our approach which
is based on the injection of CCZ states and we also relate different proofs of
contextuality to different state injections of non-covariant gates.

only a few first results on video prediction and no relevant significant

in these three problems. In this paper, we focus on human action videos, and
propose a general, two-stage deep framework to generate human action videos
with no constraints or arbitrary number of constraints, which uniformly address
the three problems: video generation given no input frames, video prediction
given the first few frames, and video completion given the first and last
frames. To make the problem tractable, in the first stage we train a deep
generative model that generates a human pose sequence from random noise. In the
second stage, a skeleton-to-image network is trained, which is used to generate
a human action video given the complete human pose sequence generated in the
first stage. By introducing the two-stage strategy, we sidestep the original
ill-posed problems while producing for the first time high-quality video
generation/prediction/completion results of much longer duration. We present
quantitative and qualitative evaluation to show that our two-stage approach

approach to multicritical scalar theories with higher derivative kinetic term
of the form $\phi(-\Box)^k\phi$ and upper critical dimension $d_c = 2nk/(n-1)$.
Depending on whether the numbers $k$ and $n$ have a common divisor two classes
of theories have been distinguished which show qualitatively different
features. For coprime $k$ and $n-1$ the theory admits a Wilson-Fisher type
fixed point with a marginal interaction $\phi^{2n}$. We derive in this case the
renormalization group equations of the potential at the functional level and
compute the scaling dimensions and some OPE coefficients, mostly at leading
order in $\epsilon$. While giving new results, the critical data we provide are
compared, when possible, and accord with a recent alternative approach using
the analytic structure of conformal blocks. Instead when $k$ and $n-1$ have a
common divisor we unveil a novel interacting structure at criticality. In this
case the phase diagram is more involved as other operators come into play at
the scale invariant point. $\Box^2$ theories with odd $n$, which fall in this
class, are analyzed in detail. Using the RG flows that are derived at quadratic
level in the couplings it is shown that a derivative interaction is unavoidable
at the critical point. In particular there is an infrared fixed point with a
pure derivative interaction at which we compute the scaling dimensions. For the
particular example of $\Box^2$ theory in $d_c=6$ we include some cubic
corrections to the flow of the potential which enable us to compute some OPE
coefficients as well.

can aid both in model selection and establishing parameter identifiability.
Here we explore the first natural geometric property of these varieties: their
dimension. The expected projective dimension of the join variety of a set of
varieties is one more than the sum of their dimensions. A join variety that
realizes the expected dimension is nondefective. Nondefectiveness is not only
interesting from a geometric point-of-view, but has been used to establish
combinatorial identifiability for several classes of phylogenetic mixture
models. In this paper, we focus on group-based models where the equivalence
classes of identified parameters are orbits of a subgroup of the automorphism
group of the group defining the model. In particular, we show that, for these
group-based models, the variety corresponding to the mixture of $r$ trees with
$n$ leaves is nondefective when $n \geq 2r+5$. We also give improved bounds for
claw trees and give computational evidence that 2-tree and 3-tree mixtures are

motile algae exhibit spontaneous density heterogeneities at large enough
concentrations. Based on the relative location of the biological actuation
appendages i.e. flagella or cilia) microswimmers' propulsion mechanism can be
classified into two categories: (i) pushers, like \textit{E. coli} bacteria or
spermatozoa, that generate thrust in their rear, push fluid away from them and
propel themselves forward; (ii) pullers, like the microalgae
\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}, that have two flagella attached to their
front, pull the fluid in and thereby generate thrust in their front. We
introduce a novel model for biological microswimmers that creates the flow
field of the corresponding microswimmers, and takes into account the shape
anisotropy of the swimmer's body and stroke-averaged flagella. By employing
multiparticle collision dynamics, we directly couple the swimmer's dynamics to
the fluid's. We characterize the nonequilibrium phase diagram, as the filling
fraction and P\'eclet number are varied, and find density heterogeneities in
the distribution of both pullers and pushers, due to hydrodynamic
instabilities. We find a maximum degree of clustering at intermediate filling
fractions and at large P\'eclet numbers resulting from a competition of
hydrodynamic and steric interactions between the swimmers. We develop an
analytical theory that supports these results. This maximum might represent an
optimum for the microorganisms' colonization of their environment.

only in the modeling of the static facial appearance, but also in the capturing
of the temporal facial dynamics. Traditional techniques to this problem focus
on constructing handcrafted features to explore the discriminative information
contained in facial appearance and dynamics separately. This relies on
sophisticated feature-refinement and framework-design. In this paper, we
present an end-to-end architecture for age estimation, called Spatially-Indexed
Attention Model (SIAM), which is able to simultaneously learn both the
appearance and dynamics of age from raw videos of facial expressions.
Specifically, we employ convolutional neural networks to extract effective
latent appearance representations and feed them into recurrent networks to
model the temporal dynamics. More importantly, we propose to leverage attention
models for salience detection in both the spatial domain for each single image
and the temporal domain for the whole video as well. We design a specific
spatially-indexed attention mechanism among the convolutional layers to extract
the salient facial regions in each individual image, and a temporal attention
layer to assign attention weights to each frame. This two-pronged approach not
only improves the performance by allowing the model to focus on informative
frames and facial areas, but it also offers an interpretable correspondence
between the spatial facial regions as well as temporal frames, and the task of
age estimation. We demonstrate the strong performance of our model in
experiments on a large, gender-balanced database with 400 subjects with ages
spanning from 8 to 76 years. Experiments reveal that our model exhibits
significant superiority over the state-of-the-art methods given sufficient

differences and similarities between the FUor and EXor populations. We find
that FUor discs are significantly more massive (~80-600 M_JUP) than the EXor
objects (~0.5-40 M_JUP ). We also report that the EXor sources lack the
prominent outflows seen in the FUor population. Even though our sample is
small, the large differences in disc masses and outflow activity suggest that
the two types of objects represent different evolutionary stages. The FUor
sources seem to be rather compact (Rc < 20-40 au) and to have a smaller

the shape of the particle energy spectrum. By analyzing the current sheet
structure, we show that physical cause of saturation is the spontaneous
formation of secondary magnetic islands that can disrupt particle acceleration.
By comparing the size of acceleration regions to the typical distance between
disruptive islands, we show that the maximum Lorentz factor produced in
reconnection is \gamma ~ 5 \sigma, which is very close to what we find in our
particle energy spectra. We also show that the dynamic range in Lorentz factor
of the power law spectrum in reconnection is < 40. The hardness of the power
law combined with its narrow dynamic range implies that relativistic
reconnection is capable of producing the hard narrowband flares observed in the
Crab Nebula but has difficulty producing the softer broadband prompt GRB
emission.

line-driven wind of the stellar donor, a fraction of which is captured by the
gravitational field of the NS. The subsequent accretion process onto the NS is
responsible for the abundant X-ray emission from SgXB. They also display
peak-to-peak variability of the X-ray flux by a factor of a few 10 to 100,
along with changes in the hardness ratios possibly due to varying absorption
along the line-of-sight. We use recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of
inhomogeneities (aka clumps) in the non-stationary wind of massive hot stars to
evaluate their impact on the time-variable accretion process. For this, we run
3D hydrodynamic simulations of the wind in the vicinity of the accretor to
investigate the formation of the bow shock and follow the inhomogeneous flow
over several spatial orders of magnitude, down to the NS magnetosphere. In
particular, we show that the impact of the wind clumps on the time-variability
of the intrinsic mass accretion rate is severely tempered by the crossing of
the shock, compared to the purely ballistic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton estimation.
We also account for the variable absorption due to clumps passing by the
line-of-sight and estimate the final effective variability of the column
density and mass accretion rate for different orbital separations. Finally, we
compare our results to the most recent analysis of the X-ray flux and the
hardness ratio in Vela X-1.

Nambu-Goldstone bosons (named axion-like particles or ALPS for their similarity
with the axion) are predicted to exist. For ALPs with a mass of neV,
photon-ALPs oscillation takes place in extra-galactic magnetic fields during
the propagation of very high energy gamma-ray photons leading to excess
radiation observed for optically thick sources. In order to verify this effect,
gamma-ray spectra from strong Galactic plane or non-galactic plane sources can
be used and the photon-ALPs mixing would lead to an energy dependent
suppression of the observed gamma-ray spectra. Here, we have used Fermi-LAT
observations of a sample of non Galactic plane gamma-ray pulsars located at
different line-of-sights to search for spectral signatures and compare the
result with the predictions using particular models for the Galactic magnetic
field.We find consistent evidence with our prevoius analysis of objects located
in the Galactic plane for a modulation of the spectra investigated at the level
of 3.66 standard deviations . In the framework of ALPS-photon oscillation, the
resulting parameters strongly depend upon the chosen magnetic field model, but
seem to be within reach of new experiments(e.g. IAXO).

fundamental weaknesses. First, memory attacks have emerged as an important
threat to the security of even device-independent quantum key distribution

example of covert channels, which have attracted a lot of attention in security
research in conventional cryptographic and communication systems. Second, it is
often implicitly assumed that the classical post-processing units of a QKD

this article, we revisit models of H2 emission in these bow shocks. We
approximate the bow shock by a statistical distribution of planar shocks
computed with a magnetized shock model. We improve on previous works by
considering arbitrary bow shapes, a finite irradiation field, and by including
the age effect of non-stationary C-type shocks on the excitation diagram and
line profiles of H2. We also examine the dependence of the line profiles on the
shock velocity and on the viewing angle: we suggest that spectrally resolved
observations may greatly help to probe the dynamics inside the bow shock. For
reasonable bow shapes, our analysis shows that low velocity shocks largely
contribute to H2 excitation diagram. This can result in an observational bias
towards low velocities when planar shocks are used to interpret H2 emission
from an unresolved bow. We also report a large magnetization bias when the
velocity of the planar model is set independently. Our 3D models reproduce
excitation diagrams in BHR71 and Orion bow shocks better than previous 1D

system at hand comprises of a dilute emulsion of concentric compound drops,

flows are considered in this study, namely, a uniaxial extensional flow and a
simple shear flow. Presence of surfactants along the drop surface leads to the
generation of an interfacial viscosity, which is different from the bulk. This
interfacial viscosity generates a viscous drag that along with bulk

that presence of interfacial viscosity reduces the deformation of a compound

the effective viscosity of the emulsion also increases with rise in interfacial
viscosity. For large values of interfacial dilatational viscosity the drop
deformation is seen to increase and hence the stability of the double emulsion

effort to capture the intricate and non-trivial coupling between the various

and convective transport of thermal energy, we obtain the droplet migration
velocity through small-deformation perturbation analysis for two different
limiting cases, namely, convection-driven-surfactant transport and
surface-diffusion-dominated surfactant transport. Under each of these limiting
cases, the cross-stream migration of droplet is studied for a constant
temperature gradient applied in the same direction as well as in a direction
opposite to the imposed flow. For the former limiting case, the droplet is
always migrates towards the centerline of flow. For a highly viscous droplet,
the direction of its cross-stream migration reverses. When the temperature
decreases in the direction of the imposed flow, cross-stream migration velocity
reduces with increase in the applied temperature gradient till a critical point
is reached at which there is no cross-stream migration. Beyond the critical
point, there is a gradual increase in the magnitude of the cross-stream
velocity. The droplet, below the critical temperature gradient, migrates
towards the flow centerline; however, above it the droplet moves away from the
centerline. For the other limiting case of surfactant transport dominated by
surface convection, the magnitude of the cross-stream velocity is found to be

Existing methods address this estimation problem by interpolating within data

assumptions about the nature of the data-generating process and/or the pattern
of missing data (both of which are especially problematic for medical data). We

$\sim 22\%$ smaller than the optimized stochastic bank constructed over a
nominal range of parameters. We also construct an explicit hybrid template bank
with parameters identical to the `uber-bank' used in the recently-concluded CBC
searches in the second observation run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo
detectors. We demonstrate a reduction of more than 53,000 templates over the
stochastic template bank at a near-identical coverage as determined by fitting
factor studies. A computationally efficient technique for semi-numerical
calculation of the parameter space metric, applicable for aligned-spin waveform
family, is also outlined. The resulting hybrid template banks can be generated
much faster in comparison to the stochastic banks, and are ready to be used in
the upcoming observation runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo.

inference and identification. For the problem of testing for existence of a
change point in an independent sample generated from the mean-shift model, we
introduce a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap to calibrate critical values of the
CUSUM test statistics in high dimensions. The proposed bootstrap CUSUM test is
fully data-dependent and it has strong theoretical guarantees under arbitrary
dependence structures and mild moment conditions. Specifically, we show that
with a boundary removal parameter the bootstrap CUSUM test enjoys the uniform
validity in size under the null and it achieves the minimax separation rate
under the sparse alternatives when the dimension $p$ can be larger than the
sample size $n$.
  Once a change point is detected, we estimate the change point location by
maximizing the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm of the generalized CUSUM statistics at two
different weighting scales corresponding to covariance stationary and
non-stationary CUSUM statistics. For both estimators, we derive their rates of
convergence and show that dimension impacts the rates only through logarithmic
factors, which implies that consistency of the CUSUM estimators is possible
when $p$ is much larger than $n$. In the presence of multiple change points, we
propose a principled bootstrap-assisted binary segmentation (BABS) algorithm to
dynamically adjust the change point detection rule and recursively estimate
their locations. We derive its rate of convergence under suitable signal
separation and strength conditions.
  The results derived in this paper are non-asymptotic and we provide extensive
simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance. The empirical
evidence shows an encouraging agreement with our theoretical results.

electron-phonon interaction from the weak coupling perturbative window to the
strong coupling polaronic regime. We explore three typical electron densities,
dilute - where spatial correlations between polarons is weak, intermediate -
where correlations are significant, and half-filling - where there is long
range checkerboard order at low temperature. We use two methods both of which
exploit the ""slowness"" of the phonons to handle the problem. These are (i)~a
standard random phase approximation (RPA), adapted to capture small quantum
fluctuations on Monte Carlo generated classical thermal backgrounds, and (ii)~a
Langevin dynamics scheme, with a simplified ``thermal noise'', that can address
large amplitude dynamical fluctuations. The Langevin scheme, as we argue in the
paper, is the superior method in the strong coupling part of the phase diagram,
where lattice distortions are large. It reveals a non trivial multi-peak
momentum resolved spectrum with a high energy part, on the scale of the bare
phonon frequency $\Omega$, and a low energy peak at $\omega \ll \Omega$. Below
the polaronic threshold, the high energy dispersion changes only modestly with
temperature $T$, while the broadening, arising from mode coupling, increases
linearly with $T$ at low temperature. The low energy peak shows up at strong
coupling and finite temperature and arises from the slow tunneling of polarons.
The tunneling events become spatially correlated as electron density increases
towards half-filling, and the weight becomes strongly momentum and temperature
dependent. We suggest the analytic basis of these results.

bulk structure BLG intercalated with first row TMs (Sc-Zn). The present DFT
calculations show that the 2$p_z$ sub-shells of C atoms in graphene and the
3$d_{yz}$ sub-shells of the TM atoms provide the electron density near the
Fermi level controlling the material properties of the BLG-intercalated
materials. This article highlights how the Dirac point moves in both the BLG
and bulk-BLG given a different TM intercalated materials. The implications of
controllable electronic structure and properties of intercalated BLG-TM for
future device applications are discussed. This work opens up new avenues for
the efficient production of two-dimensional and three-dimensional carbon-based
intercalated materials with promising future applications in nanomaterial
science.

subset $A$ of an abelian Polish group $X$ is called
Haar-countable/Haar-finite/Haar-$n$ if there are a Borel hull $B\supseteq A$
and a copy $C$ of $2^\omega$ such that $(C+x)\cap B$ is countable/finite/of
cardinality at most $n$, for all $x\in X$.
  Recently, Banakh et al. have unified the notions of Haar-null and Haar-meager
sets by introducing Haar-$\mathcal{I}$ sets, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a
collection of subsets of $2^\omega$. It turns out that if $\mathcal{I}$ is the
$\sigma$-ideal of countable sets, the ideal of finite sets or the collection of
sets of cardinality at most $n$, then we get the above notions. Moreover, those
notions have been studied independently by Zakrzewski (under a different name
-- perfectly $\kappa$-small sets).
  We study basic properties of the corresponding families of small sets, give
suitable examples distinguishing them (in all abelian Polish groups of the form
$\mathbb{R}\times X$) and study $\sigma$-ideals generated by compact members of
the considered families. In particular, we show that Haar-countable sets do not
form an ideal. Moreover, we answer some questions concerning null-finite sets,
asked by Banakh and Jab{\l}o\'nska, and pose several open problems.

intuitively one assumes that features which are good for reconstruction will
also lead to high classification accuracy. Indeed, it became research practice
and is a suggested strategy by introductory books. However, we prove that this
is not always the case. We thoroughly investigate the quality of features
produced by Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoders when trained to reconstruct
their input. In particular, we analyze the relation between the reconstruction
and classification capabilities of the network, if we were to use the same
features for both tasks. Experimental results suggest that in fact, there is no
correlation between the reconstruction score and the quality of features for a
classification task. This means, more formally, that the sub-dimension
representation space learned from the Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (while
being trained for input reconstruction) is not necessarily better separable
than the initial input space. Furthermore, we show that the reconstruction
error is not a good metric to assess the quality of features, because it is
biased by the decoder quality. We do not question the usefulness of
pre-training, but we conclude that aiming for the lowest reconstruction error
is not necessarily a good idea if afterwards one performs a classification
task.

describe ionic transport in ion channels, nanofluidic devices, and many
electrochemical systems. Despite their wide applications, the PNP equations
fail in predicting dynamics and equilibrium states of ionic concentrations in
confined environments, due to the ignorance of the excluded volume effect. In
this work, a simple but effective modified PNP (MPNP) model with the excluded
volume effect is derived, based on a modification of diffusion coefficients of
ions. At the steady state, a modified Poisson--Boltzmann (MPB) equation is
obtained with the help of the Lambert-W special function. The existence and
uniqueness of a weak solution to the MPB equation are established. Further
analysis on the limit of weak and strong electrostatic potential leads to two
modified Debye screening lengths, respectively. A numerical scheme that
conserves total ionic concentration and satisfies energy dissipation is
developed for the MPNP model. Numerical analysis is performed to prove that our
scheme respects ionic mass conservation and satisfies a corresponding discrete
free energy dissipation law. Positivity of numerical solutions is also
discussed and numerically investigated. Numerical tests are conducted to
demonstrate that the scheme is of second-order accurate in spatial
discretization and has expected properties. Extensive numerical simulations
reveal that the excluded volume effect has pronounced impacts on the dynamics
of ionic concentration and flux. In addition, the effect of volume exclusion on
the timescales of charge diffusion is systematically investigated by studying
the evolution of free energies and diffuse charges.
