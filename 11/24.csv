(MAVs) with limited communication is a challenging problem. In this paper we
address the problem of multiple MAVs mechanically coupled to a bulky object for
transportation purposes without explicit communication between agents. The
apparent physical properties of each agent are reshaped to achieve robustly
stable transportation. Parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics of each
agent are quantified and techniques from robust control theory are employed to
choose the physical parameters of each agent to guarantee stability. Extensive
simulation analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method
guarantees stability in worst case scenarios.

constraining $\tau$, $b$ and $n$ parameters, we find that the quadratic
power-law model of velocity bias $b_{v}(k)=1+b(k/k_{0})^{2}$ provides the
best-fit to the data. The best-fit values are $\tau=(1.18 \pm 0.24) \times

scale-dependent velocity bias. The fitting results indicate that the
large-scale ($k \leq 0.1\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) velocity bias is unity, while on
small scales the bias tends to become negative. The value of $\tau$ is
consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass and optical depth relation proposed

consistent with the peak background-split theory. Our method provides a direct

accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs. They essentially increased the connectivity,

graphs which are simultaneously sparse and well connected. Sparsity results in
efficiency while well connectedness can preserve the expressive power of the
CNNs. We use a well-studied class of graphs from theoretical computer science
that satisfies these properties known as Expander graphs. Expander graphs are
used to model connections between filters in CNNs to design networks called
X-Nets. We present two guarantees on the connectivity of X-Nets: Each node
influences every node in a layer in logarithmic steps, and the number of paths
between two sets of nodes is proportional to the product of their sizes. We
also propose efficient training and inference algorithms, making it possible to
train deeper and wider X-Nets effectively.
  Expander based models give a 4% improvement in accuracy on MobileNet over
grouped convolutions, a popular technique, which has the same sparsity but
worse connectivity. X-Nets give better performance trade-offs than the original

in the Deser-Woodard (DW) nonlocal gravity model. One group previously analyzed
the model in its original nonlocal form and showed that the growth of structure
in the DW model is enhanced compared to general relativity (GR) and thus
concluded that the model was ruled out. Recently, however, another group has
reanalyzed it by localizing the model and found that the growth in their
localized version is suppressed even compared to the one in GR. The question
was whether the discrepancy originates from an intrinsic difference between the
nonlocal and localized formulations or is due to their different
implementations of the sub-horizon limit. We show that the nonlocal and local
formulations give the same solutions for the linear perturbations as long as
the initial conditions are set the same. The different implementations of the
sub-horizon limit lead to different transient behaviors of some perturbation
variables; however, they do not affect the growth of matter perturbations at
the sub-horizon scale much. In the meantime, we also report an error in the
numerical calculation code of the former group and verify that after fixing the
error the nonlocal version also gives the suppressed growth. Finally, we
discuss two alternative definitions of the effective gravitational constant

The new interaction is non-renormalizable, and the model only describes physics
below some cutoff scale. Even if the unknown UV physics does not affect the
tree level inflaton potential significantly, it may still enter at loop level
and modify the running of the Standard Model (SM) parameters. This is analogous
to what happens in the original model for Higgs inflation. A key difference,
though, is that in new Higgs inflation the inflationary predictions are
sensitive to this running. Thus the boundary conditions at the EW scale as well
as the unknown UV completion may leave a signature on the inflationary
parameters. However, this dependence can be evaded if the kinetic terms of the
SM fermions and gauge fields are non-minimally coupled to gravity as well. Our
approach to determine the model's UV dependence and the connection between low

have led to considerable efforts in recent years to realize topological matters
that host these excitations. For a number-conserving system, there have been a
few proposals, using either coupled-chain models or multi-component system with
spin-orbit coupling, to create number fluctuation of fermion pairs in achieving
Majorana fermion. In this work, we show that Majorana edge states can occur in
a spinless Fermi gas in 1D lattices with tunable $p$-wave interaction. This is
facilitated by the conversion between a pair of (open-channel) fermions and a
(close-channel) boson, thereby allowing the number fluctuation of fermion pairs
in a single chain. This scheme requires neither spin-orbit coupling nor
multi-chain setup and can be implemented easily. Using the
density-matrix-renormalization-group method, we have identified the Majorana
phase in a wide range of parameter regime as well as its associated phase
transitions. The topological nature of the Majorana phase manifests itself in a
strong edge-edge correlation in an open chain that is robust against disorder,
as well as in a non-trivial winding number in the bulk generated by using
twisted boundary condition. It is also shown that the Majorana phase in this
system can be stable against atom losses due to few-body collisions on the same
site, and can be easily identified from the fermion momentum distribution.
These results pave the way for probing the intriguing Majorana physics in a

including capturing infrequent patterns, achieving small-sized but expressive
models and alleviating overfitting, several studies have been devoted to
""diversifying"" LVMs, which aim at encouraging the components in LVMs to be
diverse. Most existing studies fall into a frequentist-style regularization
framework, where the components are learned via point estimation. In this
paper, we investigate how to ""diversify"" LVMs in the paradigm of Bayesian
learning. We propose two approaches that have complementary advantages. One is
to define a diversity-promoting mutual angular prior which assigns larger
density to components with larger mutual angles and use this prior to affect
the posterior via Bayes' rule. We develop two efficient approximate posterior
inference algorithms based on variational inference and MCMC sampling. The
other approach is to impose diversity-promoting regularization directly over
the post-data distribution of components. We also extend our approach to
""diversify"" Bayesian nonparametric models where the number of components is
infinite. A sampling algorithm based on slice sampling and Hamiltonian Monte

the constituent particles. Here, we report experiments and numerical
simulations revealing that red blood cells (RBCs) assemble into regular
patterns in a confined shear flow. The order is of pure hydrodynamic and
inertialess origin, and emerges from a subtle interplay between (i)
hydrodynamic repulsion by the bounding walls which drives deformable cells
towards the channel mid-plane and (ii) intercellular hydrodynamic interactions
which can be attractive or repulsive depending on cell-cell separation. Various
crystal-like structures arise depending on RBC concentration and confinement.
Hardened RBCs in experiments and rigid particles in simulations remain
disordered under the same conditions where deformable RBCs form regular
patterns, highlighting the intimate link between particle deformability and the
emergence of order. The difference in structuring ability of healthy
(deformable) and diseased (stiff) RBCs creates a flow signature potentially
exploitable for diagnosis of blood pathologies.

and show that at a sufficiently strong coupling it demonstrates a chaotic
behavior. The chaos emerges since the spin-orbit coupling reduces the number of
the integrals of motion as compared to the number of the degrees of freedom.
This reduction is manifested in the equations of motion as the emergence of the
anomalous velocity determined by the spin orientation. By using analytical and
numerical arguments, we demonstrate that the chaotic behavior, being driven by
this anomalous term, is related to the system energy dependence on the initial
spin orientation. We observe the critical dependence of the dynamics on the
initial conditions, where system can enter and exit a stability domain by very
small changes in the initial spin orientation. Thus, this system can
demonstrate a reentrant order-from-disorder transition driven by very small
variations in the initial conditions.

current publicly available tools for nanopore sequence analysis to understand
their advantages, disadvantages, and performance bottlenecks. It is important
to understand where the current tools do not perform well to develop better
tools. To this end, we 1) analyze the multiple steps and the associated tools
in the genome assembly pipeline using nanopore sequence data, and 2) provide
guidelines for determining the appropriate tools for each step. We analyze
various combinations of different tools and expose the tradeoffs between
accuracy, performance, memory usage and scalability. We conclude that our
observations can guide researchers and practitioners in making conscious and
effective choices for each step of the genome assembly pipeline using nanopore
sequence data. Also, with the help of bottlenecks we have found, developers can
improve the current tools or build new ones that are both accurate and fast, in
order to overcome the high error rates of the nanopore sequencing technology.

transform, it is easy to derive explicit expressions for the two, three and
four-point functions. The Fourier transformation disentangles singularities in
the complex plane and extract their contribution as two-point functions in two
dimensions. We explicitly derive a one dimensional expression for the (4D)

which immediate reversals of the walks are allowed (RA) or forbidden (RF). In

phase diagrams - in space $\beta_2 \times \beta_1$ - are featured by coil and
globule phases separated by a line of $\Theta$ points, as thoroughly
demonstrated by the metric $\nu_t$, crossover $\phi_t$ and entropic $\gamma_t$

virial coefficient. This shows that no discontinuous collapse transition exists
in these models, in contrast to previous claims based on a weak bimodality
observed in some distributions, which indeed exists in a narrow region very
close to the $\Theta$-line when $\beta_1 < 0$. Interestingly, in
two-dimensions, only a crossover is found between the coil and globule phases.

  Reduction","Preliminary version of this paper will appear at NIPS 2017",,,,"stat.ML cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hashing is a basic tool for dimensionality reduction employed in several
aspects of machine learning. However, the perfomance analysis is often carried
out under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function
is used, without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The
concrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question
is if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured
input.
  In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing, namely
similarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et
al. [NIPS'12] and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. [ICML'09], both of
which have found numerous applications, i.e. in approximate near-neighbour
search with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM.
  We consider mixed tabulation hashing of Dahlgaard et al.[FOCS'15] which was
proved to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications,
including OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with
truly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar for
sparse input. Our main contribution, however, is an experimental comparison of
different hashing schemes when used inside FH, OPH, and LSH.
  We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the
multiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work
well on sufficiently random data, but we demonstrate that in the above
applications, it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and
synthetic data. We also compare with the popular MurmurHash3, which has no
proven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to
truly random hashing in our experiments. However, mixed tabulation is 40%
faster than MurmurHash3, and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on
all possible input.

dependence of the photometric calibration on interstellar reddening leads to
these conclusions: (1) For all broadband filters, a linear colour-dependent
correction compensates the gross effects of reddening where $E(B-V)<5.0$. (2)
For $Z$ and $Y$, there is a significantly larger scatter above E(B-V)=5.0, and
insufficient measurements to adequately constrain the relation beyond this
value. (3) The $JHK\!s$ filters can be corrected to a few percent up to
E(B-V)=10.0. We analyse spatial systematics over month-long timescales, both

levels in VISTA. We monitor and remove residual detector-to-detector offsets.

We show how variable seeing and transparency affect the final calibration
accuracy of VISTA tiles, and discuss a technique, {\it grouting}, for
mitigating these effects. Comparison between repeated reference fields is used

improve several existing results under different sharing environment. A number

set sharing problems were started which was later shifted towards the

develop scalable circuit models that contain the minimum information required

methods, divergent and non-divergent Hamiltonian models in circuit quantum
electrodynamics have been proposed to explain the dynamics of superconducting
quantum networks coupled to infinite-dimensional systems, such as transmission
lines and general impedance environments. Here, we study systematically common
linear coupling configurations between networks and infinite-dimensional
systems. The main result is that the simple Lagrangian models for these
configurations present an intrinsic natural length that provides a natural
ultraviolet cutoff. This length is due to the unavoidable dressing of the
environment modes by the network. In this manner, the coupling parameters
between their components correctly manifest their natural decoupling at high
frequencies. Furthermore, we show the requirements to correctly separate
infinite-dimensional coupled systems in local bases. We also compare our
analytical results with other analytical and approximate methods available in
the literature. Finally, we propose several applications of these general

12+log(O/H)=8.29-8.56, and have significantly sub-solar Fe enrichment, with an
interquartile range of [Fe/H]=[-0.79,-0.53], contributing additional evidence
in favor of super-solar O/Fe in high-z galaxies. Model-inferred ionization
parameter and N/O are strongly correlated with common strong-line indices (such
as O32 and N2O2), with the latter exhibiting similar behavior to local
extragalactic HII regions. In contrast, diagnostics commonly used for measuring
gas-phase O/H (such as N2 and O3N2) show relatively large scatter with the
overall amount of oxygen present in the gas and behave differently than
observed at z~0. We provide a new calibration for using R23 to measure O/H in
typical high-z galaxies, although it is most useful for relatively O-rich
galaxies; combining O32 and R23 does not yield a more effective calibration.
Finally, we consider implications for the intrinsic correlations between
physical conditions across the galaxy sample and find that N/O varies with O/H
in high-z galaxies in a manner almost identical to local HII regions. However,
we do not find a strong anti-correlation between ionization parameter and

We discuss in detail the two-nucleon contact interactions at fourth order and

be eliminated via suitably chosen unitary transformations. The removal of the
redundant contact terms results in a drastic simplification of the fits to
scattering data and leads to interactions which are much softer (i.e. more
perturbative) than our recent semilocal coordinate-space regularized

pion-nucleon Roy-Steiner equations to chiral perturbation theory, we perform a
comprehensive analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering and the deuteron
properties up to fifth chiral order and study the impact of the leading F-wave
two-nucleon contact interactions which appear at sixth order. The resulting

other chiral potential. For the first time, the chiral potentials match in

reduced by about ~40%. Last but not least, we perform a detailed error analysis

extends to the Riemannian setting the Minkowski addition operation of convex

geometric flow is characterized by having parallel normals (of varying
velocity) to the evolving hypersurface along the trajectory, and is intimately
related to a homogeneous Monge-Amp\`ere equation on the exterior of the convex

the evolving hypersurface, we obtain a novel Brunn--Minkowski inequality in the

for different interaction Lagrangians and for some kinds of Gaussian
propagators modified by different ultraviolet form factors $F$ which depend on
some length parameter $l$. The expansion of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is of the
form of a grand canonical partition function of some $D+N$-dimensional ($N\geq

field theory (QFT) is considered where the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is calculated
in closed form. Then, the functional Schwinger-Dyson and Schr\""{o}dinger
equations for the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix in Efimov representation are derived.
These equations play a central role in the present paper. The functional
Schwinger-Dyson and Schr\""{o}dinger equations in Efimov representation do not
involve explicit functional derivatives but involve a shift of the field which
is the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix argument. The asymptotic solutions of the
Schwinger-Dyson equation are obtained in different limits. Also, the solution
is found in one heuristic case allowing us to study qualitatively the behavior
of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix for an arbitrary finite value of its argument.
Self-consistency equations, which arise during the process of derivation, are

of the distances $d(v_i,r)$ between the detectors and the entity's location $r$

  We consider the natural generalization of the latter problem, where vertices
may be probed sequentially until the moving entity is located. At every turn, a
set $\{v_1,\cdots,v_k\}$ of vertices is probed and then the relative distances

does, in the graph $G$.
  We prove that $\zeta^* (T)\leq 2$ for every tree $T$ and give an upper bound
on $\zeta^*(G\square H)$ in cartesian product of graphs $G$ and $H$. Our main
result is that $\zeta^* (G)\leq 3$ for any outerplanar graph $G$. We then prove
that $\zeta^* (G)$ is bounded by the pathwidth of $G$ plus 1 and that the
optimization problem of determining $\zeta^* (G)$ is NP-hard in general graphs.

of vehicles to minimise a combination of acquisition and running costs over the
whole time horizon. This leads to fleet choices with much greater fleet
utilisation than methods that consider only a subset of the available demand

filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) system can achieve low out of band (OoB)
emissions and is also robust to the channel and synchronization errors.
However, it comes at a cost of long filter tails which may reduce the spectral
efficiency significantly when the block size is small. Filter output truncation
(FOT) can reduce the overhead by discarding the filter tails but may also
significantly destroy the orthogonality of FBMC system, by introducing inter
carrier interference (ICI) and inter symbol interference (ISI) terms in the
received signal. As a result, the signal to interference ratio (SIR) is
degraded. In addition, the presence of intrinsic interference terms in FBMC
also proves to be an obstacle in combining multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) with FBMC. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on the
effect of FOT in an MIMO-FBMC system. First, we derive the matrix model of
MIMO-FBMC system which is subsequently used to analyze the impact of finite
filter length and FOT on the system performance. The analysis reveals that FOT
can avoid the overhead in time domain but also introduces extra interference in
the received symbols. To combat the interference terms, we then propose a
compensation algorithm that considers odd and even overlapping factors as two
separate cases, where the signals are interfered by the truncation in different
ways. The general form of the compensation algorithm can compensate all the
symbols in a MIMO-FBMC block and can improve the SIR values of each symbol for
better detection at the receiver. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm
requires no overhead and can still achieve a comparable BER performance to the
case with no filter truncation.

maps, where $u$ maps from a fixed closed surface $M$ with metric $g$ to a
general target manifold $N$. It arises naturally as a gradient flow for the
Dirichlet energy functional viewed as acting on equivalence classes of such
pairs, obtained from the invariance under diffeomorphisms and conformal changes
of the domain metric.
  In the construction of a suitable inner product for the gradient flow a
choice of relative weight of the map tangent directions and metric tangent
directions is made, which manifests itself in the appearance of a coupling
constant $\eta$ in the flow equations.
  We study limits of the flow as $\eta$ approaches 0, corresponding to slowing
down the evolution of the metric.

automatic and derives symbolic bounds that are multivariate polynomials of the

for probabilistic programs with an effective method for automatic
resource-bound analysis of deterministic programs. It can be seen as both, an
extension of automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA) to probabilistic

has been an issue due to the self-interference between the transmitted symbols
both in the time and frequency domain (so-called intrinsic interference). In
this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity interference-free filter bank
multicarrier system with QAM modulation (FBMC/QAM) using filter deconvolution.
The proposed method is based on inversion of the prototype filters which
completely removes the intrinsic interference at the receiver and allows the
use of complex-valued signaling. The interference terms in FBMC/QAM with and
without the proposed system are analyzed and compared in terms of mean square
error (MSE). It is shown with theoretical and simulation results that the
proposed method cancels the intrinsic interference and improves the output
signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the expense of slight
enhancement of residual interferences caused by multipath channel. The
complexity of the proposed system is also analyzed along with performance
evaluation in an asynchronous multiservice scenario. It is shown that the
proposed FBMC/QAM system with filter deconvolution outperforms the conventional
OFDM system.

the number of solutions of a problem in $\#$P, is by constructing a rapidly
mixing Markov chain converging to the uniform distribution over this set of
solutions. This construction is not always an easy task, and it is conjectured
that it is not always possible. We want to investigate other possibilities for
using Markov Chains in relation to counting, and whether we can relate
algorithmic counting to other, non-uniform, probability distributions over the
set we want to count.
  In this paper we present a family of probability distributions over the set
of solutions of a problem in TotP, and show how they relate to counting;
counting is equivalent to computing their normalizing factors. We analyse the
complexity of sampling, of computing the normalizing factor, and of computing
the size support of these distributions. The latter is also equivalent to
counting. We also show how the above tasks relate to each other, and to other
problems in complexity theory as well.
  In short, we prove that sampling and approximating the normalizing factor is
easy. We do this by constructing a family of rapidly mixing Markov chains for
which these distributions are stationary. At the same time we show that exactly
computing the normalizing factor is TotP-hard. However the reduction proving
the latter is not approximation preserving, which conforms with the fact that
TotP-hard problems are inapproximable if NP $\neq$ RP.
  The problem we consider is the Size-of-Subtree, a TotP-complete problem under
parsimonious reductions. Therefore the results presented here extend to any
problem in TotP. TotP is the Karp-closure of self-reducible problems in $\#$P,
having decision version in P.

critical periods during which a temporary stimulus deficit can impair the
development of a skill. The extent of the impairment depends on the onset and
length of the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of the
neural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level statistics, such as
vertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on performance and can
be overcome with further training. To better understand this phenomenon, we use
the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity
between layers of a network during training. Counterintuitively, information
rises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing
redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss
of ""Information Plasticity"". Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs
are critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative
to the input data distribution. Once such strong connections are created, they
do not appear to change during additional training. These findings suggest that
the initial learning transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic
behavior, plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training process.
Our findings, combined with recent theoretical results in the literature, also
suggest that forgetting (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to
achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation learning. Finally,
critical periods are not restricted to biological systems, but can emerge
naturally in learning systems, whether biological or artificial, due to
fundamental constrains arising from learning dynamics and information
processing.

fill gaps between structural components in the airframe that arise due to
manufacturing tolerances adding up across large structures. These shims are
necessary to eliminate gaps, maintain structural performance, and minimize
pull-down forces required to bring the aircraft into engineering nominal
configuration for peak aerodynamic efficiency. Gap filling is a time-consuming
process, involving either expensive by-hand inspection or computations on vast
quantities of measurement data from increasingly sophisticated metrology
equipment. Either case amounts to significant delays in production, with much
of the time spent in the critical path of aircraft assembly. This work presents
an alternative strategy for predictive shimming, based on machine learning and
sparse sensing to first learn gap distributions from historical data, and then
design optimized sparse sensing strategies to streamline data collection and
processing. This new approach is based on the assumption that patterns exist in
shim distributions across aircraft, which may be mined and used to reduce the
burden of data collection and processing in future aircraft. Specifically,
robust principal component analysis is used to extract low-dimensional patterns
in the gap measurements while rejecting outliers. Next, optimized sparse
sensors are obtained that are most informative about the dimensions of a new
aircraft in these low-dimensional principal components. We demonstrate the
success of the proposed approach, called PIXel Identification Despite
Uncertainty in Sensor Technology (PIXI-DUST), on historical production data

inflation is the most successful in accounting for the latest CMB data from the
PLANCK satellite and other experiments. Moreover, recently it was shown to be
ultra-violet (UV) complete via an embedding into an analytic infinite
derivative (AID) non-local gravity. In this paper, we derive a most general
theory of gravity that contributes to perturbed linear equations of motion
around maximally symmetric space-times. We show that such a theory is quadratic
in the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor with AID operators along with the
Einstein-Hilbert term and possibly a cosmological constant. We explicitly
demonstrate that introduction of the Ricci tensor squared term is redundant.
Working in this quadratic AID gravity framework without a cosmological term we
prove that for a specified class of space homogeneous space-times, a space of
solutions to the equations of motion is identical to the space of backgrounds
in a local $R^2$ model. We further compute the full second order perturbed
action around any background belonging to that class. We proceed by extracting
the key inflationary parameters of our model such as a spectral index ($n_s$),
a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) and a tensor tilt ($n_t$). It appears that $n_s$
remains the same as in the local $R^2$ inflation in the leading slow-roll
approximation, while $r$ and $n_t$ get modified due to modification of the
tensor power spectrum. This class of models allows for any value of $r<0.07$
with a modified consistency relation which can be fixed by future observations
of primordial $B$-modes of the CMB polarization. This makes the UV complete
$R^2$ gravity a natural target for future CMB probes.

which finds latent topic variables in documents using continuous semantic
distance function between the topics and the words by means of the variational
autoencoder(VAE). The semantic distance could be represented by any symmetric
bell-shaped geometric distance function on the Euclidean space, for which the
Mahalanobis distance is used in this paper. In order for the semantic distance
to perform more properly, we newly introduce an additional model parameter for
each word to take out the global factor from this distance indicating how
likely it occurs regardless of its topic. It certainly improves the problem
that the Gaussian distribution which is used in previous topic model with
continuous word embedding could not explain the semantic relation correctly and
helps to obtain the higher topic coherence. Through the experiments with the
dataset of 20 Newsgroup, NIPS papers and CNN/Dailymail corpus, the performance
of the recent state-of-the-art models is accomplished by our model as well as
generating topic embedding vectors which makes possible to observe where the
topic vectors are embedded with the word vectors in the real Euclidean space
and how the topics are related each other semantically.

as the foundation for a new generation of magnetic storage devices. Magnetic
skyrmions, vortex-like spin textures stabilized by their topology are
particularly promising candidates for this technology. Their nanometric size
and ability to be displaced in response to an electrical current density
several orders of magnitude lower than required to induce motion of magnetic
domain walls suggest their potential for high-density memory devices that can
be operated at low power. However, to achieve this, skyrmion movement needs to
be controlled, where a key question concerns the coupling of skyrmions with the
underlying atomic lattice and disorder (pinning). Here, we use Resonant
Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), a probe highly sensitive to changes in the
elastic properties, to shed new light on skyrmion elasticity and depinning in
the archetypal skyrmion material MnSi. In MnSi, skyrmions form a lattice that
leads to pronounced changes in the elastic properties of the atomic lattice as
a result of magneto-crystalline coupling. Without an applied current, the shear
and compressional moduli of the underlying crystal lattice exhibit an abrupt
change in the field-temperature range where skyrmions form. For current
densities exceeding $j_c^*$ the changes of elastic properties vanish, signaling
the decoupling of skyrmion and atomic lattices. Interestingly, $j_c^*$, which
we identify as the onset of skyrmion depinning, is about 20 times smaller than
$j_c$ previously measured via non-linear Hall effect. Our results suggest the
presence of a previously-undetected intermediate dynamic regime possibly
dominated by skyrmion-creep motion with important consequences for potential
applications.

stretched along the 3' directions of the opposite strands (OS3) and is
characterized by the changes in the number of H-bonds, entropy and free energy.
Stretching along 5' directions of the opposite strands (OS5) leads to force
induced melting form of the DNA. Interestingly, stretching along the opposite
ends of the same strand (SS) leads to a coexistence of both the S- and melted
M-DNA structures. We also do the structural characterization of the S-DNA by
calculating various helical parameters. We find that S-DNA has a twist of ~10
degrees which corresponds to helical repeat length of ~ 36 base pairs in close
agreement with the previous experimental results. Moreover, we find that the
free energy barrier between the canonical and overstretched states of DNA is
higher for the same termini (SE) pulling protocol in comparison to all other
protocols considered in this work. Overall, our observations not only reconcile

small. Extending the model further with a singlet fermion and a triplet scalar,
DM relic density can be satisfied for even much lower masses. The lower mass DM
can be copiously produced at LHC and hence the model can be tested at collider.
For the present model we have studied the multi jet ($\geq 2\,j$) + missing

this work, we build mathematical models of various non-idealities that occur in
crossbar implementations such as source resistance, neuron resistance and
chip-to-chip device variations and analyze their impact on the classification
accuracy of a fully connected network (FCN) and convolutional neural network
(CNN) trained with standard training algorithm. We show that a network trained
under ideal conditions can suffer accuracy degradation as large as 59.84% for
FCNs and 62.4% for CNNs when implemented on non-ideal crossbars for relevant
non-ideality ranges. This severely constrains the sizes for crossbars. As a
solution, we propose a technology aware training algorithm which incorporates
the mathematical models of the non-idealities in the standard training
algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves significant
recovery of testing accuracy within 1.9% of the ideal accuracy for FCNs and
1.5% for CNNs. We further show that our proposed training algorithm can
potentially allow the use of significantly larger crossbar arrays of sizes

to suppress magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability in dynamic Z-pinches. A
rotational drive magnetic field is equivalent to two magnetic-field components,
{\Theta} and Z, that alternate in time, referred to as an alternate
Theta-Z-pinch configuration. We consider the finitely thick cylindrical liner
configuration in this paper. We numerically integrate the perturbation equation
to stagnation time based on the optimal background unperturbed trajectories. We
assess the cumulative growth of the dominant mode selected by some mechanism at
the beginning of an implosion. The maximum e-folding number at stagnation of
the dominant mode of an optimized alternate Theta-Z-pinch is significantly
lower than that of the standard Theta- or Z-pinch. The directional rotation of
the magnetic field contributes to suppress the instabilities, independent of
the finite thickness. The finite thickness effect plays a role only when the
orientation of the magnetic field varies in time whereas it does not appear in
the standard Theta- or Z-pinch. The rotating frequency of the magnetic field
and the thickness of liner are both having a monotonic effect on suppression.
Their synergistic effect can enhance the suppression on MRT instability.
Because the MRT instability can be well suppressed in this way, the alternate
Theta-Z-pinch configuration has potential applications in liner inertial
fusion. This work is supported by the NSFC (Grant Nos. 11405167, 51407171,

we provide a simple proof of confidentiality for parallel quantum channels
established via entanglement distillation based on hashing, in the presence of
noise, and a malicious eavesdropper who is restricted only by the laws of
quantum mechanics. The direct contribution lies in improving the linear
confidentiality levels of recurrence-type entanglement distillation protocols
to exponential levels for hashing protocols. The proof directly exploits the
security relevant physical properties: measurement-based quantum computation
with resource states and the separation of Bell-pairs from an eavesdropper. The
proof also holds for situations where Eve has full control over the input
states, and obtains all information about the operations and noise applied by
the parties. The resulting state after hashing is private, i.e., disentangled
from the eavesdropper. Moreover, the noise regimes for entanglement
distillation and confidentiality do not coincide: Confidentiality can be
guaranteed even in situation where entanglement distillation fails. We extend
our results to multiparty situations which are of special interest for secure
quantum networks.

beneficial technologies for next generation wireless networks due to its
enhanced performance compared to other conventional radio access techniques.
Although the principle of NOMA allows multiple users to use the same frequency
resource, due to decoding complication, information of users in practical
systems cannot be decoded successfully if many of them use the same channel.
Consequently, assigned spectrum of a system needs to be split into multiple
subchannels in order to multiplex that among many users. Uplink resource
allocation for such systems is more complicated compared to the downlink ones
due to the individual users' power constraints and discrete nature of
subchannel assignment. In this paper, we propose an uplink subchannel and power
allocation scheme for such systems. Due to the NP-hard and non-convex nature of
the problem, the complete solution, that optimizes both subchannel assignment
and power allocation jointly, is intractable. Consequently, we solve the
problem in two steps. First, based on the assumption that the maximal power
level of a user is subdivided equally among its allocated subchannels, we apply
many-to-many matching model to solve the subchannel-user mapping problem. Then,
in order to enhance the performance of the system further, we apply iterative
water-filling and geometric programming two power allocation techniques to
allocate power in each allocated subchannel-user slot optimally. Extensive
simulation has been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme always outperforms all
existing works in this context under all possible scenarios.

source domain is generally different from that of the target domain, which
results in the emergence of general cross-domain visual recognition problems.
To address the problems of visual domain mismatch, we propose a novel
semi-supervised adversarial transfer learning approach, which is called Coupled
adversarial transfer Domain Adaptation (CatDA), for distribution alignment
between two domains. The proposed CatDA approach is inspired by cycleGAN, but
leveraging multiple shallow multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of deep
networks. Specifically, our CatDA comprises of two symmetric and slim
sub-networks, such that the coupled adversarial learning framework is
formulated. With such symmetry of two generators, the input data from
source/target domain can be fed into the MLP network for target/source domain
generation, supervised by two confrontation oriented coupled discriminators.
Notably, in order to avoid the critical flaw of high-capacity of the feature
extraction function during domain adversarial training, domain specific loss
and domain knowledge fidelity loss are proposed in each generator, such that
the effectiveness of the proposed transfer network is guaranteed. Additionally,
the essential difference from cycleGAN is that our method aims to generate
domain-agnostic and aligned features for domain adaptation and transfer
learning rather than synthesize realistic images. We show experimentally on a
number of benchmark datasets and the proposed approach achieves competitive
performance over state-of-the-art domain adaptation and transfer learning
approaches.

its practical applicability. In this work, a method is presented to reconstruct
balanced gradient-echo (GRE) acquisitions with established iterative algorithms

exhaustive search. The global convergence of the iterative approach is
investigated by studying the transient dynamic response of balanced GRE

viewpoints. Our system supports three types of input queries: keyword,
single-paper and two-paper queries. The construction of a PEG mainly consists
of three steps. First, the papers are soft-clustered into communities via
metagraph factorization during which the topic distribution of each paper is
obtained. Second, topically cohesive evolution chains are extracted from the
communities that are relevant to the query. Each chain focuses on one aspect of
the query. Finally, the extracted chains are combined to generate a PEG, which
fully covers all the topics of the query. The experimental results on a
real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is able to construct

myocardium is segmented using a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN).
To characterize the segmented LV myocardium, it is subsequently encoded using
unsupervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Thereafter, patients are
classified according to the presence of functionally significant stenosis using
an SVM classifier based on the extracted and clustered encodings. Quantitative
evaluation of LV myocardium segmentation in 20 images resulted in an average
Dice coefficient of 0.91 and an average mean absolute distance between the
segmented and reference LV boundaries of 0.7 mm. Classification of patients was
evaluated in the remaining 126 CCTA scans in 50 10-fold cross-validation

demonstrate that automatic analysis of the LV myocardium in a single CCTA scan

base, a Borel set $A$ in $X$ is called $G$-semipolar, if there is no measure
$\nu\ne 0$ supported by $A$ such that $G\nu:=\int G(\cdot,y)\,d\nu(y)$ is a
continuous real function on $X$. Introducing an intrinsic Hausdorff measure
$m_G$ using $G$-balls $B(x,\rho):=\{y\in X\colon G(x,y)>1/\rho\}$, it is shown
that every set $A$ in $X$ with $m_G(A)<\infty$ is contained in a $G$-semipolar
Borel set.
  This is of interest, since $G$-semipolar sets are semipolar in the
potential-theoretic sense (countable unions of totally thin sets, hit by a
corresponding process at most countably many times) provided $G$ is really a
Green function for a harmonic space or, more generally, a balayage space.
  For classical potential theory and Riesz potentials on $R^n$ or, more
generally, for Green functions on a metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$ (where
balls are relatively compact) given by a continuous heat kernel $(x,y,t)\mapsto
p_t(x,y)$ with upper and lower bounds of the form
$t^{-\alpha/\beta}\Phi_j(d(x,y)t^{-1/\beta})$, $j=1,2$, the intrinsic Hausdorff
measure is equivalent to an ordinary Hausdorff measure $m_{\alpha-\beta}$.
  It is shown that for the corresponding space-time situation on $X\times R$
(heat equation on $R^n \times R$ in the classical case of the Gauss-Weierstrass
kernel) the intrinsic Hausdorff measure is equivalent to an anisotropic
Hausdorff measure $m_{\alpha,\beta}$ (with $\alpha=n$ and $\beta=2$ for the
heat equation). In particular, our result solves an open problem for the heat
equation (which was the initial motivation for the paper).

limiting compression to luminance values only. This may lead to changes in

However, current post-processing techniques for tone reproduction do not
explicitly consider the target display gamut. Gamut mapping on the other hand,
deals with mapping images from one color gamut to another, usually smaller,
gamut but has traditionally focused on smaller scale, chromatic changes. In
this context, we present a novel gamut and tone management framework for
color-accurate reproduction of high dynamic range (HDR) images, which is
conceptually and computationally simple, parameter-free, and compatible with
existing TMOs. In the CIE LCh color space, we compress chroma to fit the gamut
of the output color space. This prevents hue and luminance shifts while taking
gamut boundaries into consideration. We also propose a compatible lightness
compression scheme that minimizes the number of color space conversions. Our
results show that our gamut management method effectively compresses the chroma
of tone mapped images, respecting the target gamut and without reducing image
quality.

previous studies which also use radio data as a proxy for inclination angle and
suggests the Mg II emission region does not occupy a disk-like geometry. The
lack of correlation with Mg II equivalent width, however, is reported in at
least one previous study. Although the significance is not very strong (86
percent), there is a possible negative relationship between inclination angle

regulatory networks, which uses probabilistic graphical models to learn modules
of coregulated genes and their upstream regulatory programs from genome-wide

network inference, present protocols for common gene regulatory network
reconstruction scenarios based on the Lemon-Tree software, and show, using
human gene expression data, how the software can also be applied to learn
differential module networks across multiple experimental conditions.

in Local Group dwarf irregular galaxies (LMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, Sgr dIG) are
described. Two aspects of these variables are discussed. First, the short
period (P < 420 days) Miras are potentially powerful distance indicators,
provided that they have low circumstellar extinction, or can be corrected for
extinction. These are the descendants of relatively low mass stars. Secondly,
the longer period stars, many of which undergo hot bottom burning, are poorly
understood. These provide new insight into the evolution of intermediate mass
stars during the high mass-loss phases, but their use as distance indicators
depends on a much firmer understanding of their evolution.
  The change in slope of the K period luminosity relation for O-rich stars that
is seen around 400 to 420 days in the LMC is due to the onset of hot bottom
burning. It will be sensitive to metallicity and should therefore be expected
at different periods in populations with significant differences from the LMC.
  The [4.5] period-luminosity relation splits into two approximately parallel
sequences. The fainter one fits stars where the mid-infrared flux originates
from the stellar photosphere, while the brighter one fits observations
dominated by the circumstellar shell.

Here, we unravel a hidden role of A-site cation of PSCs in carrier transport
which has been largely neglected, i.e., tuning the Frohlich electron-phonon
(e-ph) coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonon by A-site cations. The key
for steering Frohlich polaron is to control the interaction strength and the
number of proton (or lithium) coordination to halide ion. The coordination to I
alleviates electron-phonon scattering by either decreasing the Born effective
charge or absorbing the LO motion of I. This novel principle discloses lower
electron-phonon coupling by several promising organic cations including
hydroxyl-ammonium cation (NH$_3$OH$^+$) and possibly Li$^+$ solvating
methylamine (Li$^+$NH$_2$CH$_3$) than methyl-ammonium cation. A new perspective
on the role of A-site cation could help in improving power efficiency and

is currently at its closest approach to the Milky Way and moving on an
elongated high-inclination orbit that takes it much farther away than
previously thought. For the first time we are also able to measure the internal
motions of stars in Sculptor. We find $\sigma_{R}=11.5 \pm 4.3$ km/s and
$\sigma_{T}=8.5\pm3.2$ km/s along the projected radial and tangential
directions, implying that the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial
orbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be
$\beta\sim 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.83}$ at a location beyond the core radius. Taken at
face value such a high radial anisotropy requires abandoning conventional
models for the mass distribution in Sculptor. Our sample is dominated by
metal-rich stars and for these we find $\beta^{MR} \sim 0.95^{+0.04}_{-0.27}$,
a value consistent with multi-component models where Sculptor is embedded in a

deep reinforcement learning. However, applying these algorithms to
high-dimensional action tasks requires tackling the combinatorial increase of
the number of possible actions with the number of action dimensions. This
problem is further exacerbated for continuous-action tasks that require fine
control of actions via discretization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural
architecture featuring a shared decision module followed by several network
branches, one for each action dimension. This approach achieves a linear
increase of the number of network outputs with the number of degrees of freedom
by allowing a level of independence for each individual action dimension. To
illustrate the approach, we present a novel agent, called Branching Dueling
Q-Network (BDQ), as a branching variant of the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network
(Dueling DDQN). We evaluate the performance of our agent on a set of
challenging continuous control tasks. The empirical results show that the
proposed agent scales gracefully to environments with increasing action
dimensionality and indicate the significance of the shared decision module in
coordination of the distributed action branches. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed agent performs competitively against a state-of-the-art continuous
control algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).

divergence, has recently gained popularity in machine learning and statistics,
as it makes feasible the use of smoothed optimal transportation distances for
data analysis. The Sinkhorn divergence allows the fast computation of an
entropically regularized Wasserstein distance between two probability
distributions supported on a finite metric space of (possibly) high-dimension.
For data sampled from one or two unknown probability distributions, we derive
the distributional limits of the empirical Sinkhorn divergence and its centered
version (Sinkhorn loss). We also propose a bootstrap procedure which allows to
obtain new test statistics for measuring the discrepancies between multivariate
probability distributions. Our work is inspired by the results of Sommerfeld
and Munk (2016) on the asymptotic distribution of empirical Wasserstein
distance on finite space using unregularized transportation costs. Incidentally
we also analyze the asymptotic distribution of entropy-regularized Wasserstein
distances when the regularization parameter tends to zero. Simulated and real
datasets are used to illustrate our approach.

minimization under the assumption of low rank plus sparse structure. In this
approach, the low rank plus sparse decomposition of the covariance matrix is
recovered by least squares minimization under nuclear norm plus $l_1$ norm
penalization. This paper proposes a new estimator of that family based on an
additional least-squares re-optimization step aimed at un-shrinking the
eigenvalues of the low rank component estimated at the first step. We prove
that such un-shrinkage causes the final estimate to approach the target as
closely as possible in Frobenius norm while recovering exactly the underlying
low rank and sparsity pattern. Consistency is guaranteed when $n$ is at least
$O(p^{\frac{3}{2}\delta})$, provided that the maximum number of non-zeros per
row in the sparse component is $O(p^{\delta})$ with $\delta \leq \frac{1}{2}$.
Consistent recovery is ensured if the latent eigenvalues scale to $p^{\alpha}$,
$\alpha \in[0,1]$, while rank consistency is ensured if $\delta \leq \alpha$.
The resulting estimator is called UNALCE (UNshrunk ALgebraic Covariance
Estimator) and is shown to outperform state of the art estimators, especially
for what concerns fitting properties and sparsity pattern detection. The
effectiveness of UNALCE is highlighted on a real example regarding ECB banking

open question in understanding high-mass star formation. Here, we present the
mass accumulation process in a hub-filament cloud G22 which is composed of four
supercritical filaments. Velocity gradients detected along three filaments
indicate that they are collapsing with a total mass infall rate of about 440
$M_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$, suggesting the hub mass would be doubled in six free-fall
times, adding up to $ \sim2 $ Myr. A fraction of the masses in the central
clumps C1 and C2 can be accounted for through large-scale filamentary collapse.
Ubiquitous blue profiles in HCO$^+$ $ (3-2) $ and $^{13}$CO $ (3-2) $ spectra
suggest a clump-scale collapse scenario in the most massive and densest clump
C1. The estimated infall velocity and mass infall rate are 0.31 km s$^{-1}$ and
$ 7.2 \times10^{-4} $ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In clump C1, a hot
molecular core (SMA1) is revealed by the SMA observations and an
outflow-driving high-mass protostar is located at the center of SMA1. The mass
of the protostar is estimated to be $ 11-15 $ $M_\odot$ and it is still growing
with an accretion rate of $ 7\times10^{-5} $ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The
coexistent infall in filaments, clump C1, and the central hot core in G22
suggests that pre-assembled mass reservoirs (i.e., high-mass starless cores)
may not be required to form high-mass stars. In the course of high-mass star
formation, the central protostar, the core, and the clump can simultaneously
grow in mass via core-fed/disk accretion, clump-fed accretion, and
filamentary/cloud collapse.

popular detection methods for univariate time series data: the EARS algorithm
of the CDC, and the Farrington algorithm more popular at European public health
institutions. This is followed by a discussion of methods that extend some of
the univariate methods to a multivariate setting. This may enable the detection
of outbreaks whose signal is only weakly present in any single data stream

outbreak detection in spatio-temporal data. These methods are not only tasked
with determining if and when an outbreak started to emerge, but also where. In
particular, the scan statistics methodology for outbreak cluster detection in
discrete-time area-referenced data is discussed, as well as similar methods for

programmability and implementation of traditional network functions into
generic hardware, in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). To provide
services, the VNFs are commonly concatenated in a certain ordered sequence,
known as Service Function Chains (SFCs). SFCs are usually required to meeting a
certain level of reliability. This creates the need to place the VNFs while
optimizing reliability jointly with other objectives, such as network and
server load balancing. Traditional migration and replication mechanisms,
commonly used for Virtual Machines (VM) in data centers, can be used to improve
SFC reliability. We study how to improve service reliability using jointly
replications and migrations, considering the chaining problem inherent in NFV.
While replications provide reliability, performing migrations to more reliable
servers decreases the resource overhead. A Linear Programming (LP) model is
presented to study the impact of active-active configurations on the network
and server resources. Additionally, to provide a fast recovery from server
failures, we consider N-to-N configurations in NFV networks and study its
impact on server resources. The results show that replications do not only
improve reliability, but can also be used to achieving a better server and
network load balancing, and when used jointly with migrations can improve
resource utilization without degrading reliability.

demographic fluctuations (internal noise) drive two species to extinction in a

the most likely to be the surviving one (""law of the weakest""). Here, we model
environmental (external) noise by assuming that the reproduction-predation rate
of the ""strongest species"" (the fastest to reproduce/predate) in a given static
environment randomly switches between two values corresponding to more and less
favorable external conditions. We study the joint effect of environmental and
demographic noise on the species survival probabilities and on the mean
extinction time. In particular, we investigate whether the survival
probabilities follow the law of the weakest and analyze their dependence of the
external noise intensity and switching rate. Remarkably, when, on average,
there is a finite number of switches prior to extinction, the survival
probability of the predator of the species whose reaction rate switches
typically varies non-monotonically with the external noise intensity (with
optimal survival about a critical noise strength). We also outline the
relationship with the case where all reaction rates switch on markedly
different time scales.

size, electric field strength and surfactant concentration we cover the whole
range of electric capillary numbers ($Ca_E$) from 0 up to the limit of drop
disintegration. The results are compared with the analytical result by Taylor
(1964) which predicts the asymptotic deformation as a function of $Ca_E$. We
find that the addition of surfactant damps the transient oscillations and that
the drops may be stretched slightly beyond the stability limit found by Taylor.
We proceed to study the damping of the oscillations, and show that increasing
the surfactant concentration has a dual effect of first increasing the damping
at low concentrations, and then increasing the asymptotic deformation at higher
concentrations. We explain this by comparing the Marangoni forces and the
interfacial tension as the drops deform. Finally, we have observed in the
experiments a significant hysteresis effect when drops in oil with large
concentration of surfactant are subjected to repeated deformations with
increasing electric field strengths. This effect is not attributable to the

The effects of the Mach number on the VSF evolution are different in three
stages. In the early stage, the jumps of the compressive velocity component
near shocklets generate sinks to contract surrounding vortex surfaces, which
shrink vortex volume and distort vortex surfaces. The subsequent reconnection
of vortex surfaces, quantified by the minimal distance between approaching
vortex surfaces and the exchange of vorticity fluxes, occurs earlier and has a
higher reconnection degree for larger $Ma$ owing to the dilatational
dissipation and shocklet-induced reconnection of vortex lines. In the late
stage, the positive dissipation rate and negative pressure work accelerate the
loss of kinetic energy and suppress vortex twisting with increasing $Ma$.

When the
input sketch is badly drawn, the output of common image-to-image translation
follows the input edges due to the hard condition imposed by the translation
process. Instead, we propose to use sketch as weak constraint, where the output
edges do not necessarily follow the input edges. We address this problem using
a novel joint image completion approach, where the sketch provides the image
context for completing, or generating the output image. We train a generated
adversarial network, i.e, contextual GAN to learn the joint distribution of
sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our contextual GAN
has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for
simple and effective learning of joint distribution in the same image-sketch
space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while
the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more
freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features as
previous conditional GANs do. Third, from the joint image's point of view,
image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image
completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments
evaluated on three different datasets show that our contextual GAN can generate
more realistic images than state-of-the-art conditional GANs on challenging
inputs and generalize well on common categories.

pre-trained CNN followed by fully-connected layers is investigated for
representing music audio. ii) We further suggest an end-to-end architecture
that simultaneously trains convolutional layers and fully-connected layers to
better learn temporal structures of music audio. Particularly, our end-to-end

of the IMF, while accounting also for radial variations in stellar metallicity,
the overall $\alpha$-elements abundance, and the abundance of individual
elements such as Ti, O, Na and Ca. Our analysis reveals a strong IMF gradient
in M87, corresponding to an exceeding fraction of low-mass stars compared to
the case of the Milky Way toward the center of M87 that drops to nearly
Milky-way levels by 0.4 $R_e$. This IMF gradient is found to correlate well
with both the radial profile for stellar metallicity and for $\alpha$-elements
abundance but not with stellar velocity dispersion. Such IMF variations
correspond to over a factor two increase in stellar mass-to-light M/L ratio
compared to the case of a Milky-way like IMF, consistent with other
investigations into IMF gradients in early-type galaxies, including recent
dynamical constraints on M/L radial variations in M87 by Oldham & Auger. In
addition to constraining the IMF in M87 we also looked into the abundance of
Sodium, which turned up to be super-Solar over the entire radial range of our

findings suggest an additional role of metallicity in boosting the Na-yields in
the central, metal-rich regions of M87 during its early and brief

inclined ~6 degrees compared to the outer disk. The gas-disk inclination is
well constrained from the kinematics; the derived inclination 13.7 $\pm$ 0.4
degrees agrees well with that derived from photometry and from what one expects
using the inverse Tully-Fisher relation. We find a prolonged SFH in the ring
with stellar populations as old as 2-3 Gyr and an indication that the star
formation triggered by the minor merger event was delayed in the disk compared
to the ring. There are two separate stellar components: an old population that
counter-rotates with the gas, and a young one, concentrated to the ring, that
co-rotates with the gas. We recover the kinematics of the old stars from a
two-component fit, and show that combining the old and young stellar
populations results in the erroneous average velocity of nearly zero found from
a one-component fit. The superior spatial resolution and large field of view of
MUSE allow us to establish the kinematics and SFH of the nuclear ring in NGC

orientifolds tend to stabilize runaway directions. These two properties can
have interesting implications and widen in an intriguing way the variety of

toward elucidation of the origins of life because optimization of the growth
potential across rounds of selection is necessary for Darwinian evolution. To
produce another copy with approximately the same composition, the exponential
growth rates for all components have to be equal. How such balanced growth is
achieved, however, is not a trivial question, because this kind of growth
requires orchestrated replication of the components in stochastic and nonlinear
catalytic reactions. By considering a mutually catalyzing reaction in two- and
three-dimensional lattices, as represented by a cellular automaton model, we
show that self-reproduction with exponential growth is possible only when the
replication and degradation of one molecular species is much slower than those
of the others, i.e., when there is a minority molecule. Here, the synergetic
effect of molecular discreteness and crowding is necessary to produce the
exponential growth. Otherwise, the growth curves show superexponential growth
because of nonlinearity of the catalytic reactions or subexponential growth due
to replication inhibition by overcrowding of molecules. Our study emphasizes
that the minority molecular species in a catalytic reaction network is
necessary to acquire evolvability at the primitive stage of life.

levels. We further investigate the interplay between autoscaling and regular

state-of-the-art elasticity metrics, but also on time- and memory-related
autoscaling-complexity metrics. Our main results give strong and quantitative

autoscaling policies perform differently across application domains and by how

obtained during a time span of $\sim$1200 days. We investigate spectroscopic
variability of up to 12 diagnostic lines by using the zero and first moments of
the line profiles. We perform a frequency analysis of both the spectroscopic

amplitudes in the zero and first moments of the photospheric lines of up to
15\% and 30 \kms, respectively. The amplitude of the line-profile variability
is correlated with the line formation depth in the photosphere and wind. All

multi-periodic variability with timescales of a few days to several weeks. The

a labeled source domain and learn a classifier for an unlabeled target domain,
with a similar but different data distribution. Most deep learning approaches
to domain adaptation consist of two steps: (i) learn features that preserve a
low risk on labeled samples (source domain) and (ii) make the features from
both domains to be as indistinguishable as possible, so that a classifier
trained on the source can also be applied on the target domain. In general, the
classifiers in step (i) consist of fully-connected layers applied directly on
the indistinguishable features learned in (ii). In this paper, we propose a
different way to do the classification, using similarity learning. The proposed
method learns a pairwise similarity function in which classification can be
performed by computing similarity between prototype representations of each
category. The domain-invariant features and the categorical prototype
representations are learned jointly and in an end-to-end fashion. At inference
time, images from the target domain are compared to the prototypes and the
label associated with the one that best matches the image is outputed. The
approach is simple, scalable and effective. We show that our model achieves

is achieved by careful design choices in pose parameterization, which leverages
both 2D and 3D properties of depth map. Specifically, we decompose the pose
parameters into a set of per-pixel estimations, i.e., 2D heat maps, 3D heat
maps and unit 3D directional vector fields. The 2D/3D joint heat maps and 3D
joint offsets are estimated via multi-task network cascades, which is trained
end-to-end. The pixel-wise estimations can be directly translated into a vote

while enforcing consensus between the the estimated 3D pose and the pixel-wise
2D and 3D estimations by design. Our method is efficient and highly accurate.

conductive lid over warm convective ice scenarios for a variety of conditions.
The modeled crater depth-diameter is strongly dependent on thermal gradient and
temperature of the warm convective ice. Our results indicate that both a fully
conductive (thin) shell and a conductive-convective (thick) shell can reproduce
the observed crater depth-diameter and morphologies. For the conductive ice
shell over ocean, the best fit is an approximately 8 km thick conductive ice
shell. Depending on the temperature (255 - 265 K) and therefore strength of
warm convective ice, the thickness of the conductive ice lid is estimated at 5
- 7 km. If central features within the crater, such as pits and domes, form
during crater collapse, our simulations are in better agreement with the fully
conductive shell (thin shell). If central features form well after the impact,
however, our simulations suggest a conductive-convective shell (thick shell) is
more likely. Although our study does not provide firm conclusion regarding the

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called SENATUS, for joint traffic
anomaly detection and root-cause analysis. Inspired from the concept of a
senate, the key idea of the proposed approach is divided into three stages:
election, voting and decision. At the election stage, a small number of
\nop{traffic flow sets (termed as senator flows)}senator flows are chosen\nop{,
which are used} to represent approximately the total (usually huge) set of
traffic flows. In the voting stage, anomaly detection is applied on the senator
flows and the detected anomalies are correlated to identify the most possible
anomalous time bins. Finally in the decision stage, a machine learning
technique is applied to the senator flows of each anomalous time bin to find
the root cause of the anomalies. We evaluate SENATUS using traffic traces
collected from the Pan European network, GEANT, and compare against another
approach which detects anomalies using lossless compression of traffic
histograms. We show the effectiveness of SENATUS in diagnosing anomaly types:
network scans and DoS/DDoS attacks.

treatment both in vitro and in vivo. However, the anti-cancer mechanism is
still largely unknown. CAP may kill cancer cells via triggering the rise of
intracellular ROS, DNA damage, mitochondrial damage, or cellular membrane
damage. While, the specific vulnerability of cancer cells to CAP has been
observed, the underlying mechanism of such cell-based specific vulnerability to
CAP is completely unknown. Here, through the comparison of CAP treatment and
H2O2 treatment on 10 different cancer cell lines in vitro, we observed that the
H2O2 consumption speed by cancer cells was strongly correlated to the
cytotoxicity of CAP treatment on cancer cells. Cancer cells that clear
extracellular H2O2 more quickly are more resistant to the cytotoxicity of CAP
treatment. This finding strongly indicates that the anti-oxidant system in
cancer cells play a key role in the specific vulnerability of cancer cells to
CAP treatment in vitro.

derive the equivalent kernels of MLPs with ReLU or Leaky ReLU activations for

by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights. In deep

to identify 1) a prevalence of both [OIII]$\lambda5007$ line blue asymmetry and
bulk velocity blueshift of both [NeIII]$\lambda3869$ and [NeV]$\lambda3426$
lines, when the [\ion{O}{2}]$\lambda3727$ line is used as a reference. The
velocity offset of [\ion{O}{3}]$\lambda5007$ line is, however, distributed

dependence of NLR gas outflow on $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ allows us to argue that
the pressure caused by the wind/radiation launched/emitted from central
supermassive black hole is the most likely origin of the outflow in these
distant quasars, which implies that the outflow in luminous AGNs up to $z\sim1$

subjected to a Fourier transformation. The logarithm of the squared norm of the
Fourier transform was plotted against the squared distance from the origin.
Linear correlations were observed in the logarithmic plots, indicating that the
PSF of the test images can be approximated with a Gaussian. The MTF was then
calculated from the Gaussian-approximated PSF. The obtained MTF closely
coincided with the MTF predicted from the original PSF. The MTF of an x-ray

The obtained MTF showed good agreement with the MTF determined from an edge
profile of an aluminum test object. We suggest that this approach is an
alternative way of estimating the MTF, independently of the image type.

methods display HSIs in false color, which contradicts with user experience and
expectation. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach based on
constrained manifold learning, whose goal is to learn a visualized image that
not only preserves the manifold structure of the HSI but also has natural
colors. Manifold learning preserves the image structure by forcing pixels with
similar signatures to be displayed with similar colors. A composite kernel is
applied in manifold learning to incorporate both the spatial and spectral
information of HSI in the embedded space. The colors of the output image are
constrained by a corresponding natural-looking RGB image, which can either be
generated from the HSI itself (e.g., band selection from the visible
wavelength) or be captured by a separate device. Our method can be done at
instance-level and feature-level. Instance-level learning directly obtains the
RGB coordinates for the pixels in the HSI while feature-level learning learns
an explicit mapping function from the high dimensional spectral space to the
RGB space. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed
method in information preservation and natural color visualization.

increasing ion beam fluence. The results are analyzed and compared with those
of previous experiments performed with pure acetone. It is observed that the
molecular nitrogen column density decrease very fast, suggesting that nitrogen
quickly leaves a porous sample under irradiation. The behavior of acetone in
the mixture confirms that the ice formed by deposition of vapor mixture is more
porous than that of pure acetone ice. The most abundant molecular species
formed from the mixture during irradiation are: C$_3$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_6$, N$_3$,
CO, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. Some N-bearing species are also formed, but with low
production yield. Comparing with pure acetone results, it is seen that
dissolving acetone in nitrogen affects the formation cross sections of the new
species: CH$_4$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$CO, for example, have formation cross section
smaller than the respective values for irradiated pure acetone, while those for
CO and C$_2$H$_6$ species are higher. This fact can explain the presence of
C$_2$H$_6$ even in regions on Pluto where CH$_4$ is not pure, but diluted in a

  Perspectives",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The excessive amounts of data generated by devices and Internet-based sources
at a regular basis constitute, big data. This data can be processed and
analyzed to develop useful applications for specific domains. Several
mathematical and data analytics techniques have found use in this sphere. This
has given rise to the development of computing models and tools for big data
computing. However, the storage and processing requirements are overwhelming
for traditional systems and technologies. Therefore, there is a need for
infrastructures that can adjust the storage and processing capability in
accordance with the changing data dimensions. Cloud Computing serves as a
potential solution to this problem. However, big data computing in the cloud
has its own set of challenges and research issues. This chapter surveys the big
data concept, discusses the mathematical and data analytics techniques that can
be used for big data and gives taxonomy of the existing tools, frameworks and
platforms available for different big data computing models. Besides this, it
also evaluates the viability of cloud-based big data computing, examines
existing challenges and opportunities, and provides future research directions
in this field.

critical point, they act as cavities in a fluctuating medium and thereby
restrict and modify the fluctuation spectrum in a way which depends on their
relative configuration. As a result effective, so-called critical Casimir
forces (CCFs) emerge between the colloids. The range and the amplitude of CCFs
depend sensitively on the temperature and the composition of the solvent as
well as on the boundary conditions of the order parameter of the solvent at the
particle surfaces. These remarkable, moreover universal features of the CCFs
provide the possibility for an active control over the assembly of colloids.
This has triggered a recent surge of experimental and theoretical interest in
these phenomena. We present an overview of current research activities in this
area. Various experiments demonstrate the occurrence of thermally reversible
self-assembly or aggregation or even equilibrium phase transitions of colloids
in the mixed phase below the lower consolute points of binary solvents. We
discuss the status of the theoretical description of these phenomena, in
particular the validity of a description in terms of effective, one-component
colloidal systems and the necessity of a full treatment of a ternary
solvent-colloid mixture. We suggest perspectives on the directions towards
which future research in this field might develop.

  Approach","14 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use a relativistic argument to define an effective photon that travels
through a transparent (non-absorbing) nondispersive dielectric medium of index
of refraction $n$. If $p$ is the momentum of the photon in a vacuum, then the
momentum of an effective photon inside the medium may be of the form $p_{\rm
eff}=pn^\alpha$ and still reproduce the observed transverse relativistic drift
when the medium is in motion. We employ an energy argument to determine the
value of the exponent to be $\alpha =-1$, so that the effective photon momentum
is $p_{\rm eff}=p/n$, which is the Abraham momentum.
