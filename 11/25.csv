that can be computed recursively by deleting and contracting edges. We
generalize this invariant to any class of combinatorial objects with deletion
and contraction operations, associating to each such class a universal Tutte
character by a functorial procedure. We show that these invariants satisfy a
universal property and convolution formulae similar to the Tutte polynomial.
With this machinery we recover classical invariants for delta-matroids, matroid
perspectives, relative and colored matroids, generalized permutohedra, and
arithmetic matroids, and produce some new convolution formulae. Our principal
tools are combinatorial coalgebras and their convolution algebras. Our results
generalize in an intrinsic way the recent results of
Krajewski--Moffatt--Tanasa.

tearing, suggesting they will not form in physical systems. Understanding
magnetic reconnection thus requires study of the stability of a current sheet
as it forms. Formation can occur due to sheared, sub-Alfv\'enic incompressible
flows which narrow the sheet. Standard tearing theory (Furth et al. 1963; Coppi
et al. 1976; Rutherford 1973) is not immediately applicable to such forming
sheets for two reasons: first, because the flow introduces terms not present in
the standard calculation; second, because the changing equilibrium introduces
time dependence to terms which are constant in the standard calculation,
complicating the formulation of an eigenvalue problem. This paper adapts
standard tearing mode analysis to confront these challenges. In an initial
phase when any perturbations are primarily governed by ideal MHD, a coordinate
transformation reveals that the flow compresses and stretches perturbations. A
multiple scale formulation describes how linear tearing mode theory (Furth et
al. 1963; Coppi et al. 1976) can be applied to an equilibrium changing under
flow, showing that the flow affects the separable exponential growth only
implicitly, by making the standard scalings time-dependent. In the nonlinear
Rutherford stage, the coordinate transformation shows that standard theory can
be adapted by adding to the stationary rates time dependence and an additional
term due to the strengthening equilibrium magnetic field. Overall, this
understanding supports the use of flow-free scalings with slight modifications
to study tearing in a forming sheet.

Although, the modes (n=1-10) are found to be unstable in ideal MHD, the
structure of all modes is edge localized. Growth rates of all modes are found
to be increasing initially with wall position before they reach ideal wall
saturation limit (no wall limit). No global core modes are found to be
dominantly unstable in our analysis. The design of $q_{min}>2$ and strong

complex of narrow absorption lines (NALs). As a pilot study of this type of
BAL, we show this discovery through a typical example in this paper. Utilizing
the two-epoch observations of J002710.06-094435.3 (hereafter J0027-0944) from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find that each of the C IV and Si IV
BAL troughs contains at least four NAL doublets. By resolving the Si IV BAL
into multiple NALs, we present the following main results and conclusions.
First, all these NALs show coordinated variations between the two-epoch SDSS
observations, suggesting that they all originate in the quasar outflow, and
that their variations are due to global changes in the ionization condition of
the absorbing gas. Secondly, a BAL consisting of a number of NAL components
indicates that this type of BAL is basically the same as the intrinsic NAL,
which tends to support the inclination model rather than the evolution model.
Thirdly, although both the C IV and Si IV BALs originate from the same clumpy
substructures of the outflow, they show different profile shapes: multiple
absorption troughs for the Si IV BAL in a wider velocity range, while P-Cygni
for the C IV BAL in a narrower velocity range. This can be interpreted by the
substantial differences in fine structure and oscillator strength between the
Si IV {\lambda}{\lambda}1393, 1402 and C IV {\lambda}{\lambda}1548, 1551
doublets. Based on the above conclusions, we consider that the decomposition of
a BAL into NALs can serve as a way to resolve the clumpy structure for
outflows, and it can be used to learn more about characteristics of the clumpy
structure and to test the outflow model, when utilizing high-resolution spectra
and photoionization model.

speculate upon the detection prospect of the quantum graviton in the
terrestrial accelerator-based experiment. We carefully investigate the ""golden""
channels, $J/\psi(\Upsilon)\to\gamma+\text{graviton}$, which can be pursued at
\textsf{BESIII} and \textsf{Belle 2} experiments, by searching for
single-photon plus missing energy events. Within the effective field theory
(EFT) framework of General Relativity (GR) together with Nonrelativistic QCD
(NRQCD), we are capable of making solid predictions for the corresponding decay
rates. It is found that these extremely suppressed decays are completely
swamped by the Standard Model background events $J/\psi (\Upsilon)\to
\gamma+\nu\bar{\nu}$. Meanwhile, we also study these rare decay processes in
the context of massive gravity, and find the respective decay rates in the
limit of vanishing graviton mass drastically differ from their counterparts in
GR. Counterintuitive as the failure of smoothly recovering GR results may look,
our finding is reminiscent of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity
widely known in classical gravity, which can be traced to the finite
contribution of the helicity-zero graviton in the massless limit. Nevertheless,
at this stage we are not certain about the fate of the discontinuity
encountered in this work, whether it is merely a pathology or not. If it could
be endowed with some physical significance, the future observation of these
rare decay channels, would, in principle, shed important light on the nature of
gravitation, whether the graviton is strictly massless, or bears a very small
but nonzero mass.

the recent proposal of a novel ruler, also located in the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation range of scales of the correlation function, dubbed the ""linear
point"". Unlike the peak, it is insensitive at the $0.5\%$ level to many of the
non-linear effects that distort the clustering correlation function and shift
the peak. However, this is not enough to make the linear point a useful
standard ruler. In addition, we require a model-independent method to estimate
its value from real data, avoiding the need to deploy a poorly known non-linear
model of the correlation function. In this manuscript, we precisely validate a
procedure for model-independent estimation of the linear point. We also
identify the optimal set-up to estimate the linear point from the correlation
function using galaxy catalogs. The methodology developed here is of general
validity, and can be applied to any galaxy correlation-function data. As a
working example, we apply this procedure to the LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples

paper, we propose a set of methods based on kernel rotation and flip to enable

rotation can be achieved on kernels of 3 $\times$ 3, while kernel flip can be
applied on kernels of any size. By rotating in eight or four angles, the
convolutional layers could produce the corresponding number of feature maps

retain the invariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the

desired steady-state values of the input and output variables are nonzero, and
thus one is interested in passivity with respect to the shifted signals. We
consider port-Hamiltonian systems with strictly convex Hamiltonian, and derive
conditions under which shifted passivity is guaranteed. In case the Hamiltonian
is quadratic and state dependency appears in an affine manner in the
dissipation and interconnection matrices, our conditions reduce to negative
semidefiniteness of an appropriately constructed constant matrix. Moreover, we
elaborate on how these conditions can be extended to the case when the shifted
passivity property can be enforced via output feedback, thus paving the path
for controller design. Stability of forced equilibria of the system is analyzed
invoking the proposed passivity conditions. The utility and relevance of the
results are illustrated with their application to a 6th order synchronous

an SNR expanding in an ambient density gradient that increases from east to

asymmetric interaction between the SN reverse shock and the PWN that displaces
the bulk of the PWN material away from the pulsar, towards the northeast. The

10 solar masses, and an average surrounding density of 0.4 cm^-3. However, a

complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant
properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this
problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is
only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite
precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly
convoluted Euclidean sets, are \emph{a priori} unknown, and, as it happens in
any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and
over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a
network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional
complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to
approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and
finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled
maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these
sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any
spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately
calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from observed
data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable
to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain
activity from EEG signals measured at different brain regions or the
characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at
different Earth regions.

  capacities in quantum brain networks: Lesson from black holes","11 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We implement a mechanism - originally proposed as a model for the large
memory storage capacity of black holes - in quantum neural networks and show
that an exponentially increased capacity of pattern storage and recognition is
achieved in certain critically excited states, without involvement of synaptic
plasticity. We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons
with weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic
weights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity.
These states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the
neurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower
the response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results,
the latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of
patterns within a narrow energy gap. The stored patterns can be recognized and
retrieved with perfect response under the influence of arbitrarily soft input
stimuli. In sharp contrast, under the same stimuli the recall is absent in the
ground-state of the system. The lesson is that the state with the highest
micro-state entropy and memory storage capacity is not necessarily a local
minimum of energy, but rather an excited critical state. The considered
phenomenon has a smooth classical limit and can serve for achieving an enhanced
memory storage capacity in classical brain networks.

$\mu_{\alpha}\,\cos(\delta) = -0.37\pm0.57$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\delta}
=-3.39\pm0.58$ mas yr$^{-1}$. Combining this with the known line-of-sight
velocity, this corresponds to a Galactocentric V$_\mathrm{rad}=84\pm9$ and
V$_\mathrm{tan}=164^{+66}_{-55}$ km s$^{-1}$. Applying Milky Way halo masses
between 0.8 to 1.6$\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ results in an apocenter at
33.9$^{+21.7}_{-7.4}$ kpc and pericenter at 15.4$^{+10.1}_{-9.0}$ kpc from the
Galactic center, indicating Segue~1 is rather tightly bound to the Milky Way.
Since neither the orbital pole of Segue 1 nor its distance to the Milky Way is
similar to the more massive classical dwarfs, it is very unlikely that Segue 1
was once a satellite of a massive known galaxy. Using cosmological zoom-in
simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we identify subhalos on similar orbits
as Segue~1, which imply the following orbital properties: a median first infall
8.1$^{+3.6}_{-4.3}$ Gyrs ago, a median of 4 pericentric passages since then and
a pericenter of 22.8$^{+4.7}_{-4.8}$ kpc. This is slightly larger than the
pericenter derived directly from Segue 1 and Milky Way parameters, because
galaxies with a small pericenter are more likely to be destroyed. Of the
surviving subhalo analogs only 27\% were previously a satellite of a more
massive dwarf galaxy (that is now destroyed), thus Segue 1 is more likely to
have been accreted on its own.

layers enriched with seed nuclei coming from prior strong $s$ processing. These
seeds are transformed to proton-richer isotopes mainly by photodisintegration
reactions. Several thousand trajectories from a 2D explosion model were used in
a Monte Carlo approach. Temperature-dependent uncertainties were assigned
individually to thousands of rates varied simultaneously in post-processing in
an extended nuclear reaction network. The uncertainties in the final nuclear
abundances originating from uncertainties in the astrophysical reaction rates
were determined. In addition to the 35 classical $p$ nuclides, abundance
uncertainties were also determined for the radioactive nuclides $^{92}$Nb,
$^{97,98}$Tc, $^{146}$Sm, and for the abundance ratios

velocity kick while located at the center of a gravitational potential,
analogous to a star cluster, due to either a natal kick or the anisotropic
emission of gravitational waves during a black hole-black hole merger. Our
investigation specifically focuses on how well various Chandrasekhar-based
dynamical friction models can predict the orbital decay of kicked black holes
with $m_{bh} \lesssim 100 M_\odot$ due to an inhomogeneous background stellar
field. In general, the orbital evolution of a kicked black hole follows that of
a damped oscillator where two-body encounters and dynamical friction serve as
sources of damping. However, we find models for approximating the effects of
dynamical friction do not accurately predict the amount of energy lost by the
black hole if the initial kick velocity $v_{k}$ is greater than the stellar
velocity dispersion $\sigma$. For all kick velocities, we also find that
two-body encounters with nearby stars can cause the energy evolution of a
kicked BH to stray significantly from standard dynamical friction theory as
encounters can sometimes lead to an energy gain. For larger kick velocities, we
find the orbital decay of a black hole departs from classical theory completely
as the black hole's orbital amplitude decays linearly with time as opposed to
exponentially. Therefore, we have developed a linear decay formalism which
scales linearly with black hole mass and $\frac{v_{k}}{\sigma}$ in order to
account for the variations in the local gravitational potential.

to think of amplitudes as differential forms directly on kinematic space. We
explore this picture for a wide range of massless theories in general spacetime
dimensions. For the bi-adjoint cubic scalar, we establish a direct connection
between its ""scattering form"" and a classic polytope--the associahedron--known
to mathematicians since the 1960's. We find an associahedron living naturally
in kinematic space, and the tree amplitude is simply the ""canonical form""
associated with this ""positive geometry"". Basic physical properties such as
locality, unitarity and novel ""soft"" limits are fully determined by the
geometry. Furthermore, the moduli space for the open string worldsheet has also
long been recognized as an associahedron. We show that the scattering equations
act as a diffeomorphism between this old ""worldsheet associahedron"" and the new
""kinematic associahedron"", providing a geometric interpretation and novel
derivation of the bi-adjoint CHY formula. We also find ""scattering forms"" on
kinematic space for Yang-Mills and the Non-linear Sigma Model, which are dual
to the color-dressed amplitudes despite having no explicit color factors. This
is possible due to a remarkable fact--""Color is Kinematics""--whereby kinematic
wedge products in the scattering forms satisfy the same Jacobi relations as

yield can match the peak luminosities of fast-declining, 91bg-like Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), they systematically fail to reproduce their faster
light-curve evolution. Here we illustrate the impact of a low ejecta mass on
the radiative display of low-luminosity SNe Ia, by comparing a sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$
model resulting from the pure central detonation of a C-O White Dwarf (WD) to a
$M_{\rm Ch}$ delayed-detonation model with the same $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ yield of
0.12 M$_{\odot}$. Our sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ model from a 0.90 M$_{\odot}$ WD
progenitor has a $\sim$5 day shorter rise time in the integrated UV-optical-IR
(uvoir) luminosity, as well as in the $B$-band, and a $\sim$20 per cent higher
peak uvoir luminosity ($\sim$1 mag brighter peak $M_B$). This sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$
model also displays bluer maximum-light colours due to the larger specific
heating rate, and larger post-maximum uvoir and $B$-band decline rates. The
luminosity decline at nebular times is also more pronounced, reflecting the
enhanced escape of gamma rays resulting from the lower density of the
progenitor WD. The deficit of stable nickel in the innermost ejecta leads to a
notable absence of forbidden lines of [Ni II] in the nebular spectra. In
contrast, the $M_{\rm Ch}$ model displays a strong line due to [Ni II] 1.939
$\mu\rm{m}$, which could in principle serve to distinguish between different
progenitor scenarios. Our sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ model offers an unprecedented
agreement with optical and near-infrared observations of the 91bg-like SN
1999by, making a strong case for a WD progenitor significantly below the
Chandrasekhar-mass limit for this event and other low-luminosity SNe Ia.

redshift can lead to the formation of star-forming clumps in the halos of these
galaxies without the presence of dark matter sub-structure. In certain cases,
these clumps can be the birth places of metal poor globular-clusters (MP GCs).
Using cosmological simulations, we show that narrow streams of dense gas
feeding massive galaxies from the cosmic web can fragment, producing
star-forming clumps. We then derive an analytical model for the properties of
streams as a function of halo mass and redshift, and assess when these are
gravitationally unstable, when this can lead to collapse and star-formation in
the halo, and when it may result in the formation of MP GCs. For stream
metalicities >~1% solar, this is likely to occur at z>4.5. At z~6, the
collapsing clouds have masses of (5-10)x10^7 M_{sun} and the average stream
pressure is ~10^6 K cm^{-3}. The conditions for GC formation are met in the
extremely turbulent ""eyewall"" at ~0.3 R_{vir}, where counter-rotating streams
can collide, driving very large densities. Our scenario can account for the
observed kinematics and spatial distribution of MP GCs, the correlation between
their mass and metalicity, and the mass ratio between the GC system and the
host halo. For MW mass halos, we infer that ~30% of MP GCs could have formed in
this way, the remainder likely accreted in mergers. Our predictions for GC
formation along circumgalactic filaments at high-redshift are testable with
JWST.

that physical systems with hierarchical organization tend to be more adaptable
due to their ability to efficiently span the set of available states. We used
the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) to quantify the hierarchical
organization in the expression of collective dissemination associated and IBC
associated genes, and found that the CCC of both gene sets was higher in (a)
epithelial cell lines as compared to mesenchymal cell lines and (b) IBC tumor
samples as compared to non-IBC breast cancer samples. A higher CCC of both
networks was also correlated with a higher rate of metastatic relapse in breast
cancer patients. Gene set enrichment analysis could not provide similar
insights, indicating that the CCC provides additional information regarding the

retention of epithelial traits in disseminating tumor cells as IBC progresses
promotes successful metastasis and the CCC may be a prognostic factor for IBC.

both aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy
production and biomass synthesis. Understanding the metabolic reprogramming in

characterized by a more modular expression pattern of cancer-associated genes.
In this work, we analyzed the expression patterns of metabolism genes in terms
of modularity for 371 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that higher modularity significantly correlated
with glycolytic phenotype, later tumor stages, higher metastatic potential, and
cancer recurrence, all of which contributed to poorer overall prognosis. Among
patients that recurred, we found the correlation of greater modularity with
worse prognosis during early to mid-progression. Furthermore, we developed
metrics to calculate individual modularity, which was shown to be predictive of
cancer recurrence and patients' survival and therefore may serve as a
prognostic biomarker. Our overall conclusion is that more aggressive HCC
tumors, as judged by decreased host survival probability, had more modular
expression patterns of metabolic genes. These results may be used to identify
cancer driver genes and for drug design.

building blocks, called as SMART, whose goal is to simultaneously model
appearance and relation from RGB input in a separate and explicit manner.
Specifically, SMART blocks decouple the spatiotemporal learning module into an
appearance branch for spatial modeling and a relation branch for temporal
modeling. The appearance branch is implemented based on the linear combination
of pixels or filter responses in each frame, while the relation branch is
designed based on the multiplicative interactions between pixels or filter
responses across multiple frames. We perform experiments on three action
recognition benchmarks: Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrating that SMART
blocks obtain an evident improvement over 3D convolutions for spatiotemporal
feature learning. Under the same training setting, ARTNets achieve superior
performance on these three datasets to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

that the family constitutes a Lie algebra structure and each vector field from

vector fields share a common quadratic invariant. We provide a Poisson
structure for the Lie algebra from which the second invariant for each vector
field can be readily derived. We show that each vector field from this family
can be uniquely characterized by two alternative representations, one uses a
vector potential while the other uses two functionally independent Clebsch
potentials. Our normal form results are designed to preserve these structures

allow the global melting of water ice and the release of volatile compounds,
mainly constituted of CO2, CH4 and NH3. The duration and efficiency of exchange
between the primitive massive atmosphere and the global impact-induced water
ocean likely play a key role in the chemical evolution of the early Titan's
atmosphere. To investigate the atmospheric composition of early Titan for a
wide range of global (atmosphere + ocean) composition in volatils, we first
developed a gas-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where the
non-ideal behavior of both gas and liquid phases, and the speciation of
volatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase are taken into account. We show that
the relative abundance of CO2 and NH3 determine the composition of Titan's
atmosphere. For CO2/NH3 < 1, CO2 is massively dissolved in the ocean. On the
contrary, for CO2/NH3 > 1, CO2 is the main constituent of Titan's primitive
atmosphere while the NH3 atmospheric content is dramatically decreased. We then
investigate the conditions for the formation of CH4-rich clathrates hydrates at
Titan's surface that could be the main reservoir of methane for the present-day
atmosphere. In absence of reliable experimental data in the CH4-CO2-NH3-H2O
system, the dissolution of methane in water is included using a simplified
Henry's law approach. We find that if the concentration of CH4 in Titan's
building block was higher than ~0.1 mol.kg-1 and CO2/NH3 < 3, a large fraction
of methane may be stored in the primordial crust, which would form at
temperature below ~10{\deg}C.

Recently, we have shown that the sparsity pattern of the optimal solution of GL
is equivalent to the one obtained from simply thresholding the sample
covariance matrix, for sparse graphs under different conditions. We have also
derived a closed-form solution that is optimal when the thresholded sample
covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. As a major generalization of the
previous result, in this paper we derive a closed-form solution for the GL for

equivalence conditions can significantly be simplified and are expected to hold
for high-dimensional problems if the thresholded sample covariance matrix has a

enough to reduce the GL to a maximum determinant matrix completion problem and
drive a recursive closed-form solution for the GL when the thresholded sample

taking this approach have found that individual differences in the degree of

However, inconsistent results concerning the direction of this relationship
have been obtained, with some tasks showing better performance as modularity
increases and other tasks showing worse performance. A recent theoretical model
(Chen & Deem, 2015) suggests that these inconsistencies may be explained on the
grounds that high-modularity networks favor performance on simple tasks whereas
low-modularity networks favor performance on more complex tasks. The current
study tests these predictions by relating modularity from resting-state fMRI to
performance on a set of simple and complex behavioral tasks. Complex and simple
tasks were defined on the basis of whether they did or did not draw on
executive attention. Consistent with predictions, we found a negative
correlation between individuals' modularity and their performance on a
composite measure combining scores from the complex tasks but a positive
correlation with performance on a composite measure combining scores from the
simple tasks. These results and theory presented here provide a framework for
linking measures of whole brain organization from network neuroscience to

Generalization of the detected precursors of strong flares can be used to

development of NOAA AR 12242, in which an X1.8 flare occurred on December 20,
2014. The analysis is based on regular multiazimuth and multiwavelength
observations with the RATAN-600 radio telescope in the range 1.65-10 cm with
intensity and circular polarization analysis and data from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). It was found that a new component appeared in the AR
microwave radiation two days before the X-flare. It became dominant in the AR
the day before the flare and significantly decreased after the flare. The use
of multiazimuth observations from RATAN-600 and observations at 1.76 cm from
the Nobeyama Radioheliograph made it possible to identify the radio source that
appeared before the X-flare with the site of the closest convergence of
opposite polarity fields near the neutral line in the AR. It was established
that the X-flare occurred 20 h after the total gradient of the magnetic field
of the entire region calculated from SDO/HMI data reached its maximum value.
Analysis of the evolution of the microwave source that appeared before the
X-flare in AR 12242 and comparison of its parameters with the parameters of
other components of the AR microwave radiation showed that the new source can
be classified as neutral line associated source (NLS), which were repeatedly
detected by the RATAN-600 and other radio telescopes 1-3 days before the large
flares.

to the standard RAM operations. We give lower bounds on the number of symbolic
operations for basic graph problems such as the computation of the strongly

problems in model checking such as safety, liveness, and co-liveness. Our lower
bounds are linear in the number of vertices of the graph, even for
constant-diameter graphs. For none of these problems lower bounds on the number
of symbolic operations were known before. The lower bounds show an interesting
separation of these problems from the reachability problem, which can be solved
with $O(D)$ symbolic operations, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph.

$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. This compares to
$O(n \cdot D)$ symbolic steps for the (naive) exact algorithm and $O(D)$

expression without the union operation. A union-free language is deterministic
if it can be accepted by a deterministic one-cycle-free-path finite automaton;
this is an automaton which has one final state and exactly one cycle-free path
from any state to the final state. Jir\'askov\'a and Masopust proved that the
state complexities of the basic operations reversal, star, product, and boolean
operations in deterministic union-free languages are exactly the same as those
in the class of all regular languages. To prove that the bounds are met they
used five types of automata, involving eight types of transformations of the
set of states of the automata. We show that for each $n\ge 3$ there exists one
ternary witness of state complexity $n$ that meets the bound for reversal and
product. Moreover, the restrictions of this witness to binary alphabets meet
the bounds for star and boolean operations. We also show that the tight upper
bounds on the state complexity of binary operations that take arguments over
different alphabets are the same as those for arbitrary regular languages.
Furthermore, we prove that the maximal syntactic semigroup of a union-free
language has $n^n$ elements, as in the case of regular languages, and that the
maximal state complexities of atoms of union-free languages are the same as
those for regular languages. Finally, we prove that there exists a most complex
union-free language that meets the bounds for all these complexity measures.
Altogether this proves that the complexity measures above cannot distinguish

of the system, but that model's parameters are updated online by another
mechanism called the adaptive update. This allows the controller to aim for the
benefits of exact model knowledge while simultaneously remaining robust to
model uncertainty.
  Like most nonlinear controllers, adaptive controllers are often designed and
analyzed under the assumption of deterministic full state feedback. However,
doing so inherently decouples the adaptive update mechanism from the
probabilistic information provided by modern state observers.
  The simplest way to reconcile this is to let the observer produce both state
estimates and model parameter estimates, so that all probabilistic information
is shared within the framework of the observer. While this technique is
becoming increasingly common, it is still not widely accepted due to a lack of
general closed-loop stability proofs.
  In this thesis, we will investigate observer-side parameter estimation for
adaptive control by precisely juxtaposing its mechanics against the current,
widely accepted adaptive control designs. Additionally, we will propose a new
technique that increases the robustness of observer-based adaptive control by
following the same line of reasoning used for the popular concurrent learning

exploits prefix characteristics to build a two-level data structure designed to

prefix density, SHIP first clusters prefixes into groups sharing similar
characteristics, then it builds a hybrid trie-tree for each prefix group. The
compact and scalable data structure built can be stored in on-chip low-latency

synthetic prefix tables holding up to 580 k IPv6 prefixes, SHIP has a
logarithmic scaling factor in terms of the number of memory accesses, and a
linear memory consumption scaling. Using the largest synthetic prefix table,
simulations show that compared to other well-known approaches, SHIP uses at

the loop, indicating the type-II nature of the nodal line. Spin-orbit coupling
generates only a small energy gap ($\sim$35 meV) at the nodal points and does
not negate the band dispersion of Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ that yields the type-II nodal
line. Based on this prediction we have synthesized Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ single crystals
and confirmed the presence of the type-II nodal lines in the material. Our
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements agree well with
our first-principles results and thus establish Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ as an ideal
materials platform for studying the exotic properties of type-II nodal line
semimetals.

studied for a network of wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating over

stations (SBSs) with limited computational resources act as VR control centers
that collect the tracking information from VR users over the cellular uplink
and send them to the VR users over the downlink. In such a setting, VR users
may send or request correlated or similar data (panoramic images and tracking
data). This potential spatial data correlation can be factored into the
resource allocation problem to reduce the traffic load in both uplink and
downlink. This VR resource allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative
game that allows jointly optimizing the computational and spectrum resources,
while being cognizant of the data correlation. To solve this game, a transfer
learning algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state
networks (ESNs) is proposed. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning
algorithms that must be executed each time the environment changes, the
proposed algorithm can intelligently transfer information on the learned
utility, across time, to rapidly adapt to environmental dynamics due to factors
such as changes in the users' content or data correlation. Simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 16.7% and 18.2% gains in terms

for example considering document title only or document body only. Since in
practice documents typically have multiple fields, and given that non-neural
ranking models such as BM25F have been developed to take advantage of document
structure, this paper investigates how neural models can deal with multiple
document fields. We introduce a model that can consume short text fields such
as document title and long text fields such as document body. It can also
handle multi-instance fields with variable number of instances, for example
where each document has zero or more instances of incoming anchor text. Since
fields vary in coverage and quality, we introduce a masking method to handle
missing field instances, as well as a field-level dropout method to avoid
relying too much on any one field. As in the studies of non-neural field
weighting, we find it is better for the ranker to score the whole document
jointly, rather than generate a per-field score and aggregate. We find that
different document fields may match different aspects of the query and
therefore benefit from comparing with separate representations of the query
text. The combination of techniques introduced here leads to a neural ranker
that can take advantage of full document structure, including multiple instance
and missing instance data, of variable length. The techniques significantly
enhance the performance of the ranker, and also outperform a learning to rank

to a single buyer (specifically, the buyer has a value drawn fresh from known

rational and will perfectly reason about how their bids today affect the
seller's decisions tomorrow. In this work we initiate a different direction:
the buyer simply runs a no-regret learning algorithm over possible bids. We
provide a fairly complete characterization of optimal auctions for the seller
in this domain. Specifically:
  - If the buyer bids according to EXP3 (or any ""mean-based"" learning
algorithm), then the seller can extract expected revenue arbitrarily close to
the expected welfare. This auction is independent of the buyer's valuation $D$,
but somewhat unnatural as it is sometimes in the buyer's interest to overbid. -
There exists a learning algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ such that if the buyer bids
according to $\mathcal{A}$ then the optimal strategy for the seller is simply
to post the Myerson reserve for $D$ every round. - If the buyer bids according
to EXP3 (or any ""mean-based"" learning algorithm), but the seller is restricted
to ""natural"" auction formats where overbidding is dominated (e.g. Generalized
First-Price or Generalized Second-Price), then the optimal strategy for the
seller is a pay-your-bid format with decreasing reserves over time. Moreover,
the seller's optimal achievable revenue is characterized by a linear program,
and can be unboundedly better than the best truthful auction yet simultaneously
unboundedly worse than the expected welfare.

${\cal O}\big( (\log \delta(G))\times T_{kecc}(G)\big)$, where $\delta(G)$ is
the degeneracy of $G$ and equals the maximum value among the minimum vertex

delay between SBBH formation and merger ranges from $\la$\,Gyr to the Hubble
time, SBBH mergers at redshift $z\la0.3$ occur preferentially in big galaxies
with stellar mass $M_*\ga2\times10^{10}\msun$ and metallicities $Z$ peaking at
$\sim0.6Z_\odot$. However, the host galaxy stellar mass distribution of heavy
SBBH mergers ($M_{\bullet\bullet}\ga50\msun$) is bimodal with one peak at
$\sim10^9\msun$ and the other peak at $\sim2\times10^{10}\msun$. The
contribution fraction from host galaxies with $Z\la0.2Z_\odot$ to heavy mergers
is much larger than that to less heavy mergers. If SBBHs were formed in the
early universe (e.g., $z>6$), their mergers detected at $z\la0.3$ occur
preferentially in even more massive galaxies with $M_*>3\times10^{10}\msun$ and
in galaxies with metallicities mostly $\ga0.2Z_\odot$ and peaking at

fraction of SBBH mergers occur in elliptical galaxies can be significant if
those SBBHs were formed in the early universe; and about two thirds of those

distributed among multiple locations. Taking medicine for example, models of
best-practice guidelines during rural ambulance transport are distributed
across hospital settings from a rural hospital, to an ambulance, to a central
tertiary hospital. Unfortunately, these medical models require continuous and
real-time communication across individual medical models in physically
distributed treatment locations which provides vital assistance to the
clinicians and physicians. This makes it necessary to offer methods for
model-driven communication and synchronization in a distributed environment. In
this paper, we describe ModelSink, a middleware to address the problem of
communication and synchronization of heterogeneous distributed models. Being
motivated by the synchronization requirements during emergency ambulance
transport, we use medical best-practice models as a case study to illustrate
the notion of distributed models. Through ModelSink, we achieve an efficient
communication architecture, open-loop-safe protocol, and queuing and mapping
mechanisms compliant with the semantics of statechart-based model-driven
development. We evaluated the performance of ModelSink on distributed sets of
medical models that we have developed to assess how ModelSink performs in
various loads. Our work is intended to assist clinicians, EMT, and medical
staff to prevent unintended deviations from medical best practices, and
overcome connectivity and coordination challenges that exist in a distributed
hospital network. Our practice suggests that there are in fact additional
potential domains beyond medicine where our middleware can provide needed
utility.

define sentiment score through a natural language algorithm process, based on

that higher sentiment scores (more positive descriptions) and longer summary
length lead to higher occupancy rates. Our results show that while longer

play a key role in the proper wiring of the early visual system. During the
stage II these waves are triggered by a transient network of neurons, called
Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), showing a bursting activity which disappears
upon further maturation. While several models have attempted to reproduce
retinal waves, none of them is able to mimic the rhythmic autonomous bursting
of individual SACs and reveal how these cells change their intrinsic properties
during development. Here, we introduce a mathematical model, grounded on
biophysics, which enables us to reproduce the bursting activity of SACs and to
propose a plausible, generic and robust, mechanism that generates it. The core
parameters controlling repetitive firing are fast depolarizing $V$-gated
calcium channels and hyperpolarizing $V$-gated potassium channels. The
quiescent phase of bursting is controlled by a slow after hyperpolarization
(sAHP), mediated by calcium-dependent potassium channels. Based on a
bifurcation analysis we show how biophysical parameters, regulating calcium and
potassium activity, control the spontaneously occurring fast oscillatory
activity followed by long refractory periods in individual SACs. We make a
testable experimental prediction on the role of voltage-dependent potassium
channels on the excitability properties of SACs and on the evolution of this
excitability along development. We also propose an explanation on how SACs can
exhibit a large variability in their bursting periods, as observed
experimentally within a SACs network as well as across different species, yet
based on a simple, unique, mechanism. As we discuss, these observations at the
cellular level have a deep impact on the retinal waves description.

method for nonparametric regression. A classical result is that its rate of
convergence depends on the number of covariates and deteriorates quickly as the
dimension grows, which underscores the ""curse of dimensionality"" and has
limited its use in high dimensional settings. In this article, we show that
when the true regression function is single or multi-index, the effects of the
curse of dimensionality may be mitigated for the Nadaraya-Watson kernel
estimator. Specifically, we prove that with $K$-fold cross-validation, the
Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator indexed by a positive semidefinite bandwidth
matrix has an oracle property that its rate of convergence depends on the
number of indices of the regression function rather than the number of
covariates. Intuitively, this oracle property is a consequence of allowing the
bandwidths to diverge to infinity as opposed to restricting them all to
converge to zero at certain rates as done in previous theoretical studies. Our
result provides a theoretical perspective for the use of kernel estimation in
high dimensional nonparametric regression and other applications such as metric
learning when a low rank structure is anticipated. Numerical illustrations are
given through simulations and real data examples.

approximately represented by an MPS. However, the recurrence relations of
Chebyshev polynomials are broken by the approximation, leading to an error
which is accumulated with the increase of the order of expansion. Here we
propose a reorthonormalization approach to remove this error introduced in the
loss of orthogonality of the Chebyshev polynomials. Our approach, as
illustrated by comparison with the exact results for the one-dimensional XY and
Heisenberg models, improves significantly the accuracy in the calculation of
dynamical correlation functions.

massless particles. Then, how is the photon helicity translated into the
electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of propagation?
This is an issue of the internal space-time symmetries defined by Wigner's
little group for massless particles. It is noted that there are three
generators for the rotation group defining the spin of a particle at rest. The
closed set of commutation relations is a direct consequence of Heisenberg's
uncertainty relations. The rotation group can be generated by three two-by-two
Pauli matrices for spin-half particles. This group of two-by-two matrices is
called SU(2), with two-component spinors. The direct product of two spinors
leads to four states leading to one spin-0 state and one spin-1 state with
three sub-states. The SU(2) group can be expanded to another group of
two-by-two matrices called SL(2,c), which serves as the covering group for the
group of Lorentz transformations. In this Lorentz-covariant regime, it is
possible to Lorentz-boost the particle at rest to its infinite-momentum or
massless state. Also in this SL(2,c) regime, there are four spin states for
each particle, as in the case of the Dirac equation. The direct product of two
SL(2,c) spinors thus leads sixteen states. Among them, four of them can be used
for the electromagnetic four-potential, and six for the Maxwell tensor. The
gauge degree of freedom is shown to be a Lorentz-boosted rotation. The
polarization of massless neutrinos is interpreted as a consequence of the gauge
invariance.

presented computational method simulates a broad ensemble of possible molecule

energetically most convenient helical twist by free energy minimization. As
this is done for any external load, the method yields the characteristic
twist-stretch profile of the molecule and also computes the changes in the
macroscopic helix parameters i.e. average diameter and rise distance. It is
predicted that short molecules under stretching should first over-twist and
then untwist by increasing the external load. Moreover, applying a constant
load and simulating a torsional strain which over-twists the helix, it is found
that the average helix diameter shrinks while the molecule elongates, in
agreement with the experimental trend observed in kilo-base long sequences. The
quantitative relation between percent relative elongation and superhelical

They implicitly learn high (even infinite) dimensional nonlinear features in

Motivated by recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) that learn
multi-layer hierarchical representations, we propose a Stacked Kernel Network
(SKN) that learns a hierarchy of RKHS-based nonlinear features. SKN interleaves
several layers of nonlinear transformations (from a linear space to a RKHS) and
linear transformations (from a RKHS to a linear space). Similar to DNNs, a SKN
is composed of multiple layers of hidden units, but each parameterized by a
RKHS function rather than a finite-dimensional vector. We propose three ways to
represent the RKHS functions in SKN: (1)nonparametric representation,
(2)parametric representation and (3)random Fourier feature representation.
Furthermore, we expand SKN into CNN architecture called Stacked Kernel
Convolutional Network (SKCN). SKCN learning a hierarchy of RKHS-based nonlinear
features by convolutional operation with each filter also parameterized by a
RKHS function rather than a finite-dimensional matrix in CNN, which is suitable
for image inputs. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness

thick, radiatively inefficient state of the accretion disk is established.
There is a limited number of closed-form physical solutions for geometrically
thick (non-selfgravitating) toroidal equilibria of perfect fluids orbiting a
spinning black hole, and these are predominantly used as initial conditions for
simulations of accretion in the aforementioned mode. However, different initial
configurations might lead to different results and thus observational
predictions drawn from such simulations.
  We expand the known equilibria by a number of closed multiparametric
solutions with various possibilities of rotation curves and geometric shapes.
Then, we ask whether choosing these as initial conditions influences the onset
of accretion and the asymptotic state of the disk.
  We investigate a set of examples from the derived solutions in detail; we
analytically estimate the growth of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI)
from their rotation curves and evolve the analytically obtained tori using the
2D magneto-hydrodynamical code HARM. Properties of the evolutions are then
studied through the mass, energy, and angular-momentum accretion rates.
  The rotation curve has a decisive role in the numerical onset of accretion in
accordance with our analytical MRI estimates: In the first few orbital periods,
the average accretion rate is linearly proportional to the initial MRI rate in
the toroids. The final state obtained from any initial condition within the
studied class after an evolution of $\gtrsim 10$ orbital periods is mostly
qualitatively identical and the quantitative properties vary within a single
order of magnitude. The average values of the energy of the accreted fluid have
an irregular dependency on initial data, and in some cases fluid with energies
many times its rest mass is systematically accreted.

partial protein models are sufficient for some applications such as
crystallographic phasing by molecular replacement (MR) in particular, provided
these models represent a certain part of the target structure with reasonable

Twists and tangles in
coronal magnetic fields build up energy and ultimately erupt, hurling plasma
into interplanetary space. These coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are transient
riders on the ever-outflowing solar wind, which itself possesses a
three-dimensional morphology shaped by the global coronal magnetic field.
Coronal magnetism is thus at the heart of any understanding of the origins of
space weather at the Earth. However, we have historically been limited by the
difficulty of directly measuring the magnetic fields of the corona, and have
turned to observations of coronal plasma to trace out magnetic structure. This
approach is complicated by the fact that plasma temperatures and densities vary
among coronal magnetic structures, so that looking at any one wavelength of
light only shows part of the picture. In fact, in some regimes it is the lack
of plasma that is a significant indicator of the magnetic field. Such a case is
the coronal cavity: a dark, elliptical region in which strong and twisted
magnetism dwells. I will elucidate these enigmatic features by presenting
observations of coronal cavities in multiple wavelengths and from a variety of
observing vantages, including unprecedented coronal magnetic field measurements
now being obtained by the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP). These
observations demonstrate the presence of twisted magnetic fields within
cavities, and also provide clues to how and why cavities ultimately erupt as
CMEs.

redshift or systematic errors -- could potentially cause a significant bias in
the estimation of cosmological parameters. I aim to verify whether a
theoretical correction on redshift is sufficient to ease the tension between
the estimates of cosmological parameters from SNe 1a dataset and Planck 2015
results. A free parameter for redshift shift($\Delta z$) is implemented in the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Redshift error was estimated from the Joint
Light-curve Analysis(JLA) dataset and results from the Planck 2015 survey. The
estimation from JLA dataset alone gives a best fit value of $\Omega_m = 0.272$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.390$, and $\Delta z = 3.77 \times 10^{-4}$. The best fit
values of both $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ disagrees heavily with results
from other observations. Information criteria and observed density contrasts
suggest that the current data from SNe 1a is not accurate enough to give a
proper estimate of $\Delta z$. A joint analysis with Planck results seems to
give a more plausible value of the redshift error, and can potentially be used
as a probe to measure our local gravitational environment.

complex structures entail high overfitting risks. To control the
structure-based overfitting, we propose to conduct structure regularization
decoding (SR decoding). The decoding of the complex structure model is
regularized by the additionally trained simple structure model. We
theoretically analyze the quantitative relations between the structural
complexity and the overfitting risk. The analysis shows that complex structure
models are prone to the structure-based overfitting. Empirical evaluations show
that the proposed method improves the performance of the complex structure
models by reducing the structure-based overfitting. On the sequence labeling
tasks, the proposed method substantially improves the performance of the
complex neural network models. The maximum F1 error rate reduction is 36.4% for
the third-order model. The proposed method also works for the parsing task. The
maximum UAS improvement is 5.5% for the tri-sibling model. The results are
competitive with or better than the state-of-the-art results.

quantum-tunneling. In this paper we report how such a dynamical system can be
implemented using a counting process that naturally arises from sequential FN
tunneling and integration of electrons on a floating-gate (FG) device. The
self-compensating physics of the FG device makes the operation reliable and
repeatable even when tunneling-currents approach levels below 1 attoamperes. We
report measured results from different variants of fabricated prototypes, each
of which shows an excellent match with the asymptotic prime number statistics.
We also report similarities between the spectral signatures produced by the FN
device and the spectral statistics of a hypothetical prime number sequence

distributed within two specially designed seismic cloaks thanks to a
combination of transformational elastodynamics and effective medium theory was
shown to detour Rayleigh waves of frequencies lower than 10 Hz around a
cylindrical region. The aforementioned studies motivate our exploration of
interactions of surface elastic waves propagating in a thick plate (with soil
parameters) structured with concrete pillars above it. Pillars are 40 m in
height and the plate is 100 m in thickness, so that typical frequencies under
study are below 1 Hz, a frequency range of particular interest in earthquake
engineering. We demonstrate that three seismic cloaks allow for an
unprecedented flow of elastodynamic energy. These designs are achieved by first
computing ideal cloaks' parameters deduced from a geometric transform in the
Navier equations that leads to almost isotropic and symmetric elasticity (4th
order) and density (2nd order) tensors. To do this we extend the theory of
Non-Euclidean cloaking for light as proposed by the theoretical physicists
Leonhardt and Tyc. In a second step, ideal heterogeneous nearly isotropic
cloak's parameters are approximated by averaging elastic properties of sets of
pillars placed at the nodes of a bipolar coordinate grid, which is an essential
ingredient in our Non-Euclidean cloaking theory for elastodynamic waves.
Cloaking effects are studied for a clamped obstacle (reduction of the
disturbance of the wave wavefront and its amplitude behind a clamped obstacle).
Protection is achieved through reduction of the wave amplitude within the
center of the cloak.These results represent a first step towards designs of
Non-Euclidean seismic cloaks for surface (Rayleigh and Love) waves propagating
