changes to the distribution of the incoming data. Such changes can severely
affect the model performance, leading for example to misclassifications of
data. This is particularly apparent in the domain of bionic hand prostheses,
where machine learning models promise faster and more intuitive user
interfaces, but are hindered by their lack of robustness to everyday
disturbances, such as electrode shifts. One way to address changes in the data
distribution is transfer learning, that is, to transfer the disturbed data to a
space where the original model is applicable again. In this contribution, we
propose a novel expectation maximization algorithm to learn linear
transformations that maximize the likelihood of disturbed data after the
transformation. We also show that this approach generalizes to discriminative
models, in particular learning vector quantization models. In our evaluation on
data from the bionic prostheses domain we demonstrate that our approach can
learn a transformation which improves classification accuracy significantly and
outperforms all tested baselines, if few data or few classes are available in

  Gossip algorithms, which allow each node to contact a uniformly random other

applications due to their fast convergence and their robustness to failures.
Kempe et al. [FOCS'03] gave gossip algorithms to compute important aggregate
statistics if every node is given a value. In particular, they gave a beautiful
$O(\log n + \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ round algorithm to $\epsilon$-approximate
the sum of all values and an $O(\log^2 n)$ round algorithm to compute the exact
$\phi$-quantile, i.e., the the $\lceil \phi n \rceil$ smallest value.
  We give an quadratically faster and in fact optimal gossip algorithm for the
exact $\phi$-quantile problem which runs in $O(\log n)$ rounds. We furthermore
show that one can achieve an exponential speedup if one allows for an
$\epsilon$-approximation. We give an $O(\log \log n + \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$
round gossip algorithm which computes a value of rank between $\phi n$ and
$(\phi+\epsilon)n$ at every node.% for any $0 \leq \phi \leq 1$ and $0 <

be operated with the same running times even if every transmission fails with
a, potentially different, constant probability. We also give a matching

our algorithm is optimal for all values of $\epsilon$.

an excess at lower energies ensues, which then suggests a multicomponent
spectrum. We show that the HESE dataset can be explained by a single $E^{-2}$

interactions are modified by CPT violation. The low-energy excess is naturally
explained by the pileup of events from superluminal neutrino decay, and there
is no cutoff at high energies due to the contribution of subluminal
antineutrinos. The best-fit scenario with CPT violation also predicts the

fields applied perpendicular to the surface by mapping the density of states
(DOS) through Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Vortex core shapes are often
linked to the superconducting gap anisotropy---quasiparticle states inside
vortex cores extend along directions where the superconducting gap is smallest.
The superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$ crystallizes in a hexagonal structure and
vortices give DOS maps with a sixfold star shape for magnetic fields
perpendicular to the surface and the hexagonal plane. This has been associated
to a hexagonal gap anisotropy located on quasi two-dimensional Fermi surface
tubes oriented along the $c$ axis. The gap anisotropy in another,
three-dimensional, pocket is unknown. However, the latter dominates the STM
tunneling conductance. Here we measure DOS in magnetic fields parallel to the
surface and perpendicular to the $c$ axis. We find patterns of stripes due to
in-plane vortex cores running nearly parallel to the surface. The patterns
change with the in-plane direction of the magnetic field, suggesting that the
sixfold gap anisotropy is present over the whole Fermi surface. Due to a slight
misalignment between the vector of the magnetic field and the surface, our
images also show outgoing vortices. Their shape is successfully compared to
detailed calculations of vortex cores in tilted fields. Their features merge
with the patterns due to in plane vortices, suggesting that they exit at an
angle with the surface. Measuring the DOS of vortex cores in highly tilted
magnetic fields with STM can thus be used to study the superconducting gap
structure.

However, this scheme and its extended versions suffers from many disastrous

non-physical behavior problem, checkerboard problem, and main reason of shock
instability problem are due to that the Roe scheme cannot identify
multi-dimensional incompressible and compressible flows when normal Mach number
on the cell face tends to zero, and then leads to incorrect cross
modifications. Positively non-conservative problem is also identified as
another important reason for shock instability. Therefore, Mach number and an

modification with minimal numerical dissipation increases and even with
possible decreases in numerical dissipation, the mechanism of the

modified entropy fix and the rotated Riemann solver is combined with
complementary advantages as an assistant improvement for better robust. Based
on above improvements and previous developments for global cut-off and
expansion shock problems, an improvement Roe scheme for all Mach-number flow

pattern results from an optimal control model describing rapid hand movements

hand rapidly to the target and hitting the target accurately. The optimal
control model is constructed using principled approach in which we forbid the
muscle forces to exhibit any discontinuities and require the cost to be
expressed in terms of a psychophysical representation of the movement. This
yields a yank-control or jerk-control model of the movement which exhibits two
constants of the motion that are closely related to the energy and momentum in
classical mechanics. We force the optimal control model to obey Fitts law by
requiring a particular relationship hold between the constants of the motion
and the size of the target and show that the resulting model compares well to a
standard expression of Fitts law obtained empirically using observations of
computer mouse movements. We then proceed to further show how this relationship
may be obtained as the result of a simple models of the movement accuracy and
the speed/accuracy trade-off. We use the movement accuracy model to analyze
observed differences in computer mouse movement patterns between older adults

Thus, a multi-algorithm library was implemented in the Spark framework, called

  We show that neural word embedding models exhibit superior performance on the

syntactically informed model gives the overall best performance when predicting
brain activation patterns from word embeddings; whereas the GloVe
distributional method gives the overall best performance when predicting in the
reverse direction (words vectors from brain images). Interestingly, however,
the error patterns of these different models are markedly different. This may
support the idea that the brain uses different systems for processing different
kinds of words. Moreover, we suggest that taking the relative strengths of
different embedding models into account will lead to better models of the brain
activity associated with words.

angle of less than 180 degrees, and these bent DLRGs have been shown to
associate preferentially with galaxy clusters and groups. In this study, we
utilize a catalog of DLRGs in SDSS quasars with radio lobes visible in VLA
FIRST 20 cm radio data. We cross-match this catalog against three catalogs of
galaxies over the redshift range $0 < z < 0.70$, obtaining 81 tentative
matches. We visually examine each match and apply a number of selection
criteria, eventually obtaining a sample of 44 securely detected DLRGs which are
paired to a nearby massive galaxy, galaxy group, or galaxy cluster. Most of the
DLRGs identified in this manner are not central galaxies in the systems to
which they are matched. Using this sample, we quantify the projected density of
these matches as a function of projected separation from the central galaxy,
finding a very steep decrease in matches as the impact parameter increases (for
$\Sigma \propto b^{-m}$ we find $m = 2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$) out to $b \sim 2$ Mpc.
In addition, we show that the fraction of DLRGs with bent lobes also decreases
with radius, so that if we exclude DLRGs associated with the central galaxy in
the system the bent fraction is 78\% within 1 Mpc and 56\% within 2 Mpc,
compared to just 29\% in the field; these differences are significant at
$3.6\sigma$ and $2.8\sigma$ respectively. This behavior is consistent with ram
pressure being the mechanism that causes the lobes to bend.

according to the distance between the communicating aircraft, which is readily
available with the aid of the airborne radar or the global positioning system.
We derive an asymptotic closed-form expression of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as the number of transmitting
antennas tends to infinity, in the presence of realistic co-channel
interference and channel estimation errors. The achievable transmission rates
and the corresponding mode-switching distance-thresholds are readily obtained
based on this closed-form SINR formula. Monte-Carlo simulation results are used
to validate our theoretical analysis. For the specific example of 32 transmit
antennas and 4 receive antennas communicating at a 5 GHz carrier frequency and
using 6 MHz bandwidth, which are reused by multiple other pairs of
communicating aircraft, the proposed distance-based ACM is capable of providing
as high as 65.928 Mbps data rate when the communication distance is less than
25\,km.

through iterative dynamics represents an important task in numerous distributed
applications. Suitably designed filters applied to the state values can
significantly improve the convergence rate. For constant networks, these
filters can be viewed in terms of graph signal processing as polynomials in a
single matrix, the consensus iteration matrix, with filter response evaluated
at its eigenvalues. For random, time-varying networks, filter design becomes
more complicated, involving eigendecompositions of sums and products of random,
time-varying iteration matrices. This paper focuses on deriving an estimate for
the Gram matrix of error in the state vectors over a filtering window for
large-scale, stationary, switching random networks. The result depends on the
moments of the empirical spectral distribution, which can be estimated through
Monte-Carlo simulation. This work then defines a quadratic objective function
to minimize the expected consensus estimate error norm. Simulation results
provide support for the approximation.

selects a kernel attuned to the signal dynamics on-the-fly within the linear

exploits the eigenstructure of Laplacian kernel matrices to reduce

frequencies, and variabilities for several halo properties, including
centering, spin, shape (prolateness), scale radius, and virial ratio. However,
there were also halos that experienced relaxation without the presence of major
mergers. We hypothesized that this was due to minor mergers unrecorded by the

Considering Zero-Forcing (ZF) detection, we derive a closed-form quantized

approximation for coarse quantized M-QAM massive MIMO systems, by using a
linear quantization model. The proposed expression is a function of

  Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that our approximate formula gives a
tight upper bound for the BER performance of $b$-bit resolution quantized

cause a lower performance for the same systems. We also found a small BER
performance degradation in coarse quantized systems, for example 2-3 bits QPSK

characterize the interface between two materials. Although these quantities are
identical for interfaces involving only fluids, the Shuttleworth effect
demonstrates that this is not the case for most interfaces involving solids,
since their surface energies change with strain. Crystalline materials are
known to have strain dependent surface energies, but in amorphous materials,
such as polymeric glasses and elastomers, the strain dependence is debated due
to a dearth of direct measurements. Here, we utilize contact angle measurements
on strained glassy and elastomeric solids to address this matter. We show
conclusively that interfaces involving polymeric glasses exhibit strain
dependent surface energies, and give strong evidence for the absence of such a
dependence for incompressible elastomers. The results provide fundamental
insight into our understanding of the interfaces of amorphous solids and their

training distribution by a classifier) or out-of-distribution sufficiently
different from it arises in many real-world machine learning applications.
However, the state-of-art deep neural networks are known to be highly
overconfident in their predictions, i.e., do not distinguish in- and
out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based
detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the
performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since
they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a
novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can
work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms added to the
original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from
out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for
(implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one. In
essence, our method jointly trains both classification and generative neural
networks for out-of-distribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness using deep
convolutional neural networks on various popular image datasets.

metallic core-shell nanostructure is performed in order to optimize the
efficiency of third harmonic generation. As plenty of cavity modes ranging from
visible area to near infrared can be excited efficiently in core-shell
nanospheres, kinds of double resonant conditions can be formed by matching two
different multipolar cavity modes. Numerical simulations show that the third
harmonic generation (THG) intensity in the far field can be enhanced remarkably
when the THG signal couples well with the high order cavity mode. More
importantly, THG efficiency is optimum from the cavity on double resonant
conditions coupling two modes with the same order. The THG intensity differs up
to 3 magnitudes on this condition. Subsequent theoretical analysis indicates
that changing third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the metal shell while
keeping that of the core fixed has almost no effect on THG efficiency. This
finding about optimal double resonance has an appreciable effect on optimizing
THG in spherical cavity structures.

asphericity ${\cal A}$, which is proportional to the ratio of the squared

potential energy increases as the fourth power of the perturbation amplitude
matches the number of missing contacts relative to the isostatic value. In
addition, we calculate the principal curvatures of the inequality constraints
for each contact in circulo-line packings and identify specific types of
contacts with inequality constraints that possess convex curvature. These
contacts can constrain multiple degrees of freedom and allow hypostatic

pion exchanges in the $\Delta I=1$ channel with the parity-odd pion-nucleon
coupling constant $h_\pi^1$. Despite decades of experimental and theoretical
efforts, the size of this coupling constant is still not well-understood. In
this Letter we derive a soft-pion theorem relating $h_\pi^1$ and the
neutron-proton mass-splitting induced by an artificial parity-even counterpart
of the $\Delta I=1$ weak Lagrangian, and demonstrate that the theorem still
holds exact at the next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory. A
considerable amount of simplification is expected in the study of $h_\pi^1$ by
using either lattice or other QCD models following its reduction from a
parity-odd proton-neutron-pion matrix element to a simpler spectroscopic
quantity. The theorem paves the way to much more precise calculations of
$h_\pi^1$, and thus a quantitative test of the strangeness-conserving neutral
current interaction of the Standard Model is foreseen.

any optical element, with applications spanning telecommunications, computing
and wearable optics. However, the ability to retain functionality over a
continuous, broad range of wavelengths is essential for their widespread
adoption. So far, efforts to achieve this have been limited to either a
reflection configuration or operation at wavelengths other than the visible.
Here, we show that by judicious choice of nanostructures, one can independently
control both the phase and group delay, leading to broadband transmissive
achromatic metalenses and metalenses with tunable dispersion across the visible
spectrum. We demonstrate diffraction-limited broadband focusing and achromatic
imaging using metalenses across wavelengths from 470 nm to 670 nm, with focal
length change of a few percent across this 200 nm bandwidth. This approach
requires only a single layer metasurface whose thickness is on the wavelength
scale, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading.

retrieval have received considerable attention. Deep-networks-based cross-modal
hashing methods are appealing as they can integrate feature learning and hash
coding into end-to-end trainable frameworks. However, it is still challenging
to find content similarities between different modalities of data due to the
heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem, we propose an adversarial
hashing network with attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content
similarities by selectively focusing on informative parts of multi-modal data.
The proposed new adversarial network, HashGAN, consists of three building
blocks: 1) the feature learning module to obtain feature representations, 2)
the generative attention module to generate an attention mask, which is used to
obtain the attended (foreground) and the unattended (background) feature
representations, 3) the discriminative hash coding module to learn hash
functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our
framework, the generative module and the discriminative module are trained in
an adversarial way: the generator is learned to make the discriminator cannot
preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the background feature
representations, while the discriminator aims to preserve the similarities of
multi-modal data w.r.t. both the foreground and the background feature
representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed HashGAN brings substantial improvements over
other state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.

fine-grained information and has been verified as beneficial for person
retrieval in very recent literature. A prerequisite of part discovery is that
each part should be well located. Instead of using external cues, e.g., pose
estimation, to directly locate parts, this paper lays emphasis on the content
consistency within each part.
  Specifically, we target at learning discriminative part-informed features for
person retrieval and make two contributions. (i) A network named Part-based
Convolutional Baseline (PCB). Given an image input, it outputs a convolutional
descriptor consisting of several part-level features. With a uniform partition
strategy, PCB achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods,
proving itself as a strong convolutional baseline for person retrieval.
  (ii) A refined part pooling (RPP) method. Uniform partition inevitably incurs
outliers in each part, which are in fact more similar to other parts. RPP
re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in
refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency. Experiment confirms that
RPP allows PCB to gain another round of performance boost. For instance, on the
Market-1501 dataset, we achieve (77.4+4.2)% mAP and (92.3+1.5)% rank-1
accuracy, surpassing the state of the art by a large margin.

are as follows: the use of square elemental regions instead of pixels as the
processing unit, a seed generation method based on enhanced gradient values, a
seed region growing method exploiting local gradient values, a region merging
method using a similarity measure including a homogeneity distance based on
Tsallis entropy, and a termination condition of region merging using an
estimated desired number of regions. Using square regions as the processing
unit substantially reduces the time complexity of the algorithm and makes the
performance stable. The experimental results show that our method exhibits
stable performance for a variety of natural images, including heavily textured
areas, and produces good segmentation results using the same parameter values.
The results of our method are fairly comparable to, and in some respects better

M$_\odot$ and 0.2 - 1.5 M$_\odot$ are -1.33 and -1.23, respectively, in good
agreement with the Salpeter value in the solar neighborhood. We looked for the
radial variation of the mass function and found that the slope is flatter in
the inner region than in the outer region, indicating mass segregation. The
dynamical status of the cluster suggests that the mass segregation is likely
primordial. The age distribution of the PMS sources reveals that the younger

The
one-electron recoil contribution is treated within the framework of the
rigorous QED approach to first order in the electron-to-nucleus mass ratio
$m/M$ and to all orders in the parameter $\alpha Z$. These calculations are
performed in a range $Z=3-92$. The two-electron recoil term is calculated for
low- and middle-$Z$ ions within the Breit approximation using a four-component

strongly disagree with the previous calculations performed using an effective
two-component Hamiltonian. The obtained value for the recoil effect is used to
calculate the isotope shift of the $g$ factor of Li-like $^{A}$Ca$^{17+}$ with
$A=40$ and $A=48$ which was recently measured. It is found that the new
theoretical value for the isotope shift is closer to the experimental one than

condensation reactions result in the formation and dissociation of amphiphilic
molecules, respectively. Asymmetric reactions between the inner and outer
leaflets of a vesicle can transport amphiphilic molecules between the leaflets.
It is found that the resulting area difference between the two leaflets induces
bilayer sheet protrusion~(BP) and budding at low reduced volumes of the
vesicles, whereas BP only occurs at high reduced volumes. The probabilities of
these two types of transformations depend on the shear viscosity of the
surrounding fluids compared to the membrane as well as the reaction rates. A
higher surrounding fluid viscosity leads to more BP formation. The
inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the hydrophobic reaction products forms
the nuclei of BP formation, and faster diffusion of the products enhances BP
formation. Our results suggest that adjustment of the viscosity is important to
control membrane shape transformations in experiments.

mechanical and other physical properties can be prepared by electrospinning and
may be regarded as the base of bio-inspired cognitive computing units. For this
purpose, it is necessary to examine all relevant physical parameters of such
nanofiber networks. Due to the more or less random arrangement of the
nanofibers and the possibility of gaining bent nanofibers in this production
process, elementary single nanofibers with varying bending radii, from straight
fibers to those bent along half-circles, were investigated by micromagnetic
simulations, using different angles with respect to the external magnetic
field. As expected from the high aspect ratios and the resulting strong shape
anisotropy, all magnetization reversal processes took place via domain wall
processes. Changing the cross-section from circular to a circle-segment or a
rectangle significantly altered the coercive fields and its dependence on the
bending radius, especially for the magnetic field oriented perpendicular (90
deg) to the fiber axes. In all three cross-sections, an angle of 45{\deg}
between the fiber orientation and the external magnetic field resulted in the
smallest influence of the bending radius. The shapes of the longitudinal and
transverse hysteresis curves showed strong differences, depending on
cross-section, bending radius and orientation to the magnetic field, often
depicting distinct transverse magnetization peaks perpendicular to the fibers
for fibers which were not completely oriented parallel to the magnetic field.
Varying these parameters thus provides a broad spectrum of magnetization
reversal processes in magnetic nanofibers and correspondingly scenarios for a
variety of fiber-based information processing.

arises from Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.
Such a $P_V$ appears through its intimate relation with the Hankel determinant
that describes the moment generating function (MGF) of the Shannon capacity.
This originates through the multiplication of the Laguerre weight or the Gamma
density $x^{\alpha} {\rm e}^{-x},\;x> 0,$ for $\alpha>-1$ by
$(1+x/t)^{\lambda}$ with $t>0$ a scaling parameter. Here the $\lambda$
parameter ""generates"" the Shannon capacity, see Yang Chen and Matthew McKay,
IEEE Trans. IT, 58 (2012) 4594--4634. It was found that the MGF has an integral
representation as a functional of $y(t)$ and $y'(t)$, where $y(t)$ satisfies
the ""classical form"" of $P_V$. In this paper, we consider the situation where
$n,$ the number of transmit antennas, (or the size of the random matrix), tends
to infinity, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $P$ tends to infinity, such
that $s={4n^{2}}/{P}$ is finite. Under such double scaling the MGF, effectively
an infinite determinant, has an integral representation in terms of a ""lesser""
$P_{III}$. We also consider the situations where $\alpha=k+1/2,\;\;k\in
\mathbb{N},$ and $\alpha\in\{0,1,2,\dots\}$ $\lambda\in\{1,2,\dots\},$ linking
the relevant quantity to a solution of the two dimensional sine-Gordon equation
in radial coordinates and a certain discrete Painlev\'e-II. From the large $n$
asymptotic of the orthogonal polynomials, that appears naturally, we obtain the
double scaled MGF for small and large $s$, together with the constant term in

vector-based approach of the state-of-the-art methods, we exploit the nonlocal
similarities inherently existing in images by treating each patch of a color
image as a 3D tensor consisting of not only horizontal and vertical but also
spectral dimensions. A group of nonlocal similar patches form a 4D tensor for
which a nonlocal higher order dictionary is learned via higher order singular
value decomposition. The multiple sub-dictionaries contained in the higher
order dictionary decorrelate the group in each corresponding dimension, thus
help the detail of color images to be reconstructed better. Furthermore, we
promote sparsity of the final solution using a sparsity regularization based on
a weight tensor. It can distinguish those coefficients of the sparse
representation generated by the higher order dictionary which are expected to
have large magnitude from the others in the optimization. Accordingly, in the
iterative solution, it acts like a weighting process which is designed by
approximating the minimum mean squared error filter for more faithful recovery.
Experimental results confirm improvement by the proposed method over the

difficulty of a problem. A $t$-semirandom stream was introduced as an
interpolation between random-order ($t=1$) and adversarial-order ($t=n$)
streams where an adversary intercepts a random-order stream and can delay up to
$t$ elements at a time. IITK Sublinear Open Problem \#15 asks to find
algorithms whose performance degrades smoothly as $t$ increases. We show that
the celebrated online facility location algorithm achieves an expected
competitive ratio of $O(\frac{\log t}{\log \log t})$. We present a matching
lower bound that any randomized algorithm has an expected competitive ratio of
$\Omega(\frac{\log t}{\log \log t})$.
  We use this result to construct an $O(1)$-approximate streaming algorithm for
$k$-median clustering that stores $O(k \log t)$ points and has $O(k \log t)$
worst-case update time. Our technique generalizes to any dissimilarity measure
that satisfies a weak triangle inequality, including $k$-means, $M$-estimators,
and $\ell_p$ norms. The special case $t=1$ yields an optimal $O(k)$ space
algorithm for random-order streams as well as an optimal $O(nk)$ time algorithm
in the RAM model, closing a long line of research on this problem.

reduce the load of cellular infrastructure and enhance quality of network

aggregation (LWA) which is in line with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) released standard recently. In the LWA system, the process of data
offloading is different from that of WiFi interworking on the cellular core
network. WLAN APs directly connect to eNodeBs (eNBs), and the offloading is
realized in Packet Data Convergence Protocol layer (PDCP). Thus, this
architecture makes full use of existed WLAN APs to improve the performance of
indoor cellular network. Besides, benefiting from the flow control between LTE

implemented based on open source OpenAirInterface (OAI) software defined radio

carried out. Experimental results demonstrate that our design works stably with

collaborate together in order to gather, transmit and forward the sensed data

Accordingly, the proposed algorithm helps in selection of energy aware cluster

evaluated for network lifetime, energy efficiency, throughput and overall

the solutions of the advection-diffusion equation develop sharp gradients.
Instead of solving the Fokker-Planck equation in the Eulerian formulation, we
compute the motion of particles in the Lagrangian formulation, which is

numerical integrator based on a stochastic splitting method to solve the
corresponding SDEs in which the deterministic subproblem is symplectic

  Networks by Regularizing their Input Gradients","To appear in AAAI 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks have proven remarkably effective at solving many
classification problems, but have been criticized recently for two major
weaknesses: the reasons behind their predictions are uninterpretable, and the
predictions themselves can often be fooled by small adversarial perturbations.
These problems pose major obstacles for the adoption of neural networks in
domains that require security or transparency. In this work, we evaluate the
effectiveness of defenses that differentiably penalize the degree to which
small changes in inputs can alter model predictions. Across multiple attacks,
architectures, defenses, and datasets, we find that neural networks trained
with this input gradient regularization exhibit robustness to transferred
adversarial examples generated to fool all of the other models. We also find
that adversarial examples generated to fool gradient-regularized models fool
all other models equally well, and actually lead to more ""legitimate,""
interpretable misclassifications as rated by people (which we confirm in a
human subject experiment). Finally, we demonstrate that regularizing input
gradients makes them more naturally interpretable as rationales for model
predictions. We conclude by discussing this relationship between
interpretability and robustness in deep neural networks.

difficulties of locating the multi-angle objects and separating them
effectively from the background. The existing methods are not robust to angle
varies of the objects because of the use of traditional bounding box, which is
a rotation variant structure for locating rotated objects. In this article, a
new detection method is proposed which applies the newly defined rotatable
bounding box (RBox). The proposed detector (DRBox) can effectively handle the
situation where the orientation angles of the objects are arbitrary. The
training of DRBox forces the detection networks to learn the correct
orientation angle of the objects, so that the rotation invariant property can
be achieved. DRBox is tested to detect vehicles, ships and airplanes on
satellite images, compared with Faster R-CNN and SSD, which are chosen as the
benchmark of the traditional bounding box based methods. The results shows that
DRBox performs much better than traditional bounding box based methods do on
the given tasks, and is more robust against rotation of input image and target
objects. Besides, results show that DRBox correctly outputs the orientation
angles of the objects, which is very useful for locating multi-angle objects
efficiently. The code and models are available at
https://github.com/liulei01/DRBox.

  In: Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data MiningS",,,,"cs.SI cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network embedding aims at projecting the network data into a low-dimensional
feature space, where the nodes are represented as a unique feature vector and
network structure can be effectively preserved. In recent years, more and more
online application service sites can be represented as massive and complex
networks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learning
algorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data into
low-dimension feature representation can both save data storage space and
enable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the network
data. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are of
a sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In this
paper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emerging
network based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network is
aligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve the
problem, a new embedding framework, namely ""Deep alIgned autoencoder based
eMbEdding"" (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse link
and attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces the
multiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model the
network structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, which
define various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link and
attribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined as
the meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embedding
vectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been done
on real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated the
effectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.

Though sufficient convergence conditions have been studied in the literature,
verifying these conditions requires gathering all the information over the

using Gaussian BP. In this paper, we propose a novel sufficient convergence
condition for Gaussian BP that applies to both the pairwise linear Gaussian

relevant and irrelevant variables. It is typically invoked in inference, once
an assumption is made on what the relevant variables are, in order to estimate
a model from data, that affords predictions on all other (dependent) variables.
Conversely, maximum entropy can be invoked to retrieve the relevant variables
(sufficient statistics) directly from the data, once a model is identified by
Bayesian model selection. We explore this approach in the case of spin models
with interactions of arbitrary order, and we discuss how relevant interactions
can be inferred. In this perspective, the dimensionality of the inference
problem is not set by the number of parameters in the model, but by the
frequency distribution of the data. We illustrate the method showing its
