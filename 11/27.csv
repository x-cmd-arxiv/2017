capable of maintaining long-term memory of the object, and thus can naturally
deal with hard tracking scenarios including partial and total occlusion, motion

While this is possible in special cases, such as divergence-free advection

corresponds to time taken along individual pathlines of the flow. For advection
fields, where the time massless particles carried by the flow spend inside the

$O(h^{p+1/2})$ error estimates where the constant factor depends only on
$\widehat{T}$, but not on the final time $T$. This can be interpreted as
applying Gronwall's inequality in the error analysis along individual pathlines
(Lagrangian setting), instead of physical time (Eulerian setting).

paradoxically, however, sometimes the unforeseen effect of this ecosystem

we use a spatial version of a standard population dynamics model of ecosystem
engineers to study the colonization of unexplored virgin territories by a small
settlement of engineers. We find that during the expansion phase the population
density reaches values much higher than those the environment can support in
the equilibrium situation. When the colonization front reaches the boundary of
the available space, the population density plunges sharply and attains its
equilibrium value. The collapse takes place without warning and happens just
after the population reaches its peak number. We conclude that overpopulation
and the consequent collapse of an expanding population of ecosystem engineers

temperatures T_C ~ 14-18K and opacity spectral index values of beta=1.5-1.9.
The clumps/cores identified in SCUBA-2 maps have T~ 13K and similar beta

flatter at wavelengths longer than 500um. In fits involving Planck data, the
significance is limited by the uncertainty of the corrections for CO line
contamination. The fits to the SPIRE data give a median beta value slightly

beta ~1.6. Most of the observed T-beta anticorrelation can be explained by
noise. The typical submillimetre opacity spectral index beta of cold clumps is
found to be ~1.7. This is above the values of diffuse clouds but lower than in
some previous studies of dense clumps. There is only tentative evidence of

local-to-global phenomenon, which forms the combinatorial backbone of most PCP
constructions. In an agreement test, a function is given by an ensemble of
local restrictions. The agreement test checks that the restrictions agree when
they overlap, and the main question is whether average agreement of the local
pieces implies that there exists a global function that agrees with most local
restrictions.
  There are very few structures that support agreement tests, essentially
either coming from algebraic low degree tests or from direct product tests (and
recently also from high-dimensional expanders). In this work, we prove a new
agreement theorem which extends direct product tests to higher dimensions,
analogous to how low degree tests extend linearity testing. As a corollary of
our main theorem, it follows that an ensemble of small graphs on overlapping
sets of vertices can be glued together to one global graph assuming they agree
with each other on average.
  We prove the agreement theorem by (re)proving the agreement theorem for
dimension 1, and then generalizing it to higher dimensions (with the dimension
1 case being the direct product test, and dimension 2 being the graph case). A
key technical step in our proof is the reverse union bound, which allows us to
treat dependent events as if they are disjoint, and may be of independent
interest. An added benefit of the reverse union bound is that it can be used to
show that the ""majority decoded"" function also serves as a global function that
explains the local consistency of the agreement theorem, a fact that was not
known even in the direct product setting (dimension 1) prior to our work.

degrees of freedom and derive the conditions for the absence of ghosts and
Laplacian instabilities in the presence of a matter perfect fluid on the flat

graviton potential containing the dependence of three-dimensional metrics and a

the late-time cosmic acceleration in which the dark energy equation of state
$w_{\rm DE}$ is equivalent to $-1$ or varies in time. We find that the

arising from the graviton potential and show that there exist viable parameter
spaces in which neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities are present for both

gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ with non-relativistic matter as well as
the gravitational slip parameter $\eta_s$ associated with the observations of

general relativity for scalar perturbations deep inside the sound horizon.

by interacting with users. When learning from user behavior, systems must
interact with users while simultaneously learning from those interactions.
Unlike other Learning to Rank (LTR) settings, existing research in this field
has been limited to linear models. This is due to the speed-quality tradeoff
that arises when selecting models: complex models are more expressive and can
find the best rankings but need more user interactions to do so, a requirement
that risks frustrating users during training. Conversely, simpler models can be
optimized on fewer interactions and thus provide a better user experience, but
they will converge towards suboptimal rankings. This tradeoff creates a
deadlock, since novel models will not be able to improve either the user
experience or the final convergence point, without sacrificing the other. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a fast OLTR model called Sim-MGD
that addresses the speed aspect of the speed-quality tradeoff. Sim-MGD ranks
documents based on similarities with reference documents. It converges rapidly
and, hence, gives a better user experience but it does not converge towards the
optimal rankings. Second, we contribute Cascading Multileave Gradient Descent
(C-MGD) for OLTR that directly addresses the speed-quality tradeoff by using a
cascade that enables combinations of the best of two worlds: fast learning and
high quality final convergence. C-MGD can provide the better user experience of
Sim-MGD while maintaining the same convergence as the state-of-the-art MGD
model. This opens the door for future work to design new models for OLTR
without having to deal with the speed-quality tradeoff.

  Depth Profile Measurements","6 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thin film systems are often analysed by using sputter depth profiling. First
the sample gets eroded by inert gas ion impact during sputter depth profiling.
Then the elemental composition of the freshly unveiled surface is determined by
using a surface sensitive analytical method as AES or XPS, for instance. This
way the depth distributions of the elements are recorded as a function of
sputter time. The time to record the spectral data in a certain sputter depth
is kept as short as possible to avoid recontamination of the freshly sputtered
surface by adsorption of gas particles from the vacuum during the measurement.
Therefore in every sputter depth only those spectral regions are recorded,
which belong to the elements expected to be in the sample. But in case the
sample composition is entirely unknown, it is indispensable to measure wide
energy range spectra. By this approach the depth distributions of all elements
are estimated, which are detectable by the used analytical method. The
measurement of wide energy range spectra during sputter depth profile
acquisition is promising for samples, which are very insulating. If the surface
potential varies in different sputter depths, the elemental peaks are shifted
in an unpredictable way. If wide energy range spectra are recorded, the energy
scale can be re-adjusted afterwards and the data can be re-evaluated. Both use
cases are demonstrated exemplarily by sputter depth profile measurements.

the nodes are the communities and the links represent their interactions) in
order to evaluate the algorithms. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of overlapping community detection algorithms using a
set of real-world networks with known a priori community structure. Results
provide a better perception of their relative performance as compared to
classical metrics. Moreover, they show that more emphasis should be put on the
topology of the community structure. We also investigate the relationship
between the topological properties of the community structure and the
alternative evaluation measures (quality metrics and clustering metrics). It
appears clearly that they present different views of the community structure
and that they must be combined in order to evaluate the effectiveness of
community detection algorithms.

straightforward task, this is not the case for viscoelastic structures.
Seemingly elastically stable conformations of viscoelastic structures may

necessarily imply that a structure will eventually become unstable.
Understanding instabilities in viscoelastic structures requires a more
intuitive description of viscoelasticity to allow analytical results and
quantitative predictions. In this work we put forward a metric description of
viscoelasticity in which the continua is characterized by temporally evolving
reference lengths with respect to which elastic strains are measured.
Formulating the three dimensional theory using metric tensors we are able to
predict which structures will exhibit delayed instability due to viscoelastic
flow. We also quantitatively describe the viscoelastic relaxation in free
standing structures including cases where the relaxation leads to no apparent
motion. We demonstrate these results and the power of the metric approach by
elucidating the subtle mechanism of delayed instability in elastomer shells

$k+1$ windows of length $L$ where window $i$ starts at $(iJ + 1)$th symbol for

between images and class labels with the consideration of the relevance on the
semantic classes (the manifold structure of semantic classes). However, the
relationship of image classes (the manifold structure of image classes) is also
very important for the compatibility model construction. It is difficult to
capture the relationship among image classes due to unseen classes, so that the
manifold structure of image classes often is ignored in ZSL. To complement each
other between the manifold structure of image classes and that of semantic
classes information, we propose structure propagation (SP) for improving the
performance of ZSL for classification. SP can jointly consider the manifold
structure of image classes and that of semantic classes for approximating to
the intrinsic structure of object classes. Moreover, the SP can describe the
constrain condition between the compatibility function and these manifold
structures for balancing the influence of the structure propagation iteration.
The SP solution provides not only unseen class labels but also the relationship
of two manifold structures that encode the positive transfer in structure
propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that SP can attain the promising
results on the AwA, CUB, Dogs and SUN databases.

face images. In the last decades, many blind deblurring algorithms have been
proposed to restore latent sharp images. However, these algorithms run slowly
because of involving two steps: kernel estimation and following non-blind
deconvolution or latent image estimation. Also they cannot handle face images
in small size. Our proposed method restores sharp face images directly in one
step using Convolutional Neural Network. Unlike previous deep learning involved
methods that can only handle a single blur kernel at one time, our network is
trained on totally random and numerous training sample pairs to deal with the
variances due to different blur kernels in practice. A smoothness
regularization as well as a facial regularization are added to keep facial
identity information which is the key to face image applications. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can handle various blur kenels
and achieve state-of-the-art results for small size blurry face images
restoration. Moreover, the proposed method shows significant improvement in
face recognition accuracy along with increasing running speed by more than 100

the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons from star-forming galaxies.
However, models predict that superwinds may not launch in the most extreme,
compact starbursts. We explore the role of outflows in generating low optical
depths in the Green Peas (GPs), the only known star-forming population with
several confirmed and candidate LyC-leaking galaxies. With Hubble Space
Telescope UV spectra of 25 low-redshift GPs, including new observations of 13
of the most highly ionized GPs, we compare the kinematics of UV absorption
lines with indirect HI optical depth diagnostics: Ly-alpha escape fraction,
Ly-alpha peak separation, or low-ionization absorption line equivalent width.
The data suggest that high ionization kinematics tracing superwind activity may
correlate with low optical depth in some objects. However, the most extreme
GPs, including many of the best candidate LyC emitters with weak low-ionization
absorption and strong, narrow Ly-alpha profiles, show the lowest velocities.
These results are consistent with models for suppressed superwinds, which
suggests that outflows may not be the only cause of LyC escape from galaxies.

the annotation of complementary labels via transition probabilities

biased toward their own experience. For example, as shown in Figure 1, if an
annotator is more familiar with monkeys than prairie dogs when providing
complementary labels for meerkats, she is more likely to employ ""monkey"" as a
complementary label. We therefore reason that the transition probabilities will
be different. In this paper, we propose a framework that contributes three main

estimates transition probabilities with no bias. (2) It provides a general
method to modify traditional loss functions and extends standard deep neural

the reduction is available thanks to their high controllability. We further
give a detailed account of how to experimentally access this phenomenon; around
the edges, the destruction of one-particle gapless excitations can be observed
by the local radio frequency spectroscopy, while that of gapless spin
excitations can be observed by a time-dependent spin expectation value of a
superposed state of the ground state and the first excited state. We clarify
that even when the reduction occurs, a gapless edge mode is recovered around a
dislocation, which can be another piece of evidence for the reduction.

tracking problem as a classification task. However, the objective of the
classifier (label prediction) is not coupled to the objective of the tracker
(location estimation). The classification task focuses on the between-class
difference of the arbitrary objects, while the tracking task mainly deals with
the within-class difference of the same objects. In this paper, we cast the TIR
tracking problem as a similarity verification task, which is coupled well to
the objective of the tracking task. We propose a TIR tracker via a Hierarchical
Spatial-aware Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named HSSNet. To
obtain both spatial and semantic features of the TIR object, we design a
Siamese CNN that coalesces the multiple hierarchical convolutional layers.
Then, we propose a spatial-aware network to enhance the discriminative ability
of the coalesced hierarchical feature. Subsequently, we train this network end
to end on a large visible video detection dataset to learn the similarity
between paired objects before we transfer the network into the TIR domain.
Next, this pre-trained Siamese network is used to evaluate the similarity
between the target template and target candidates. Finally, we locate the
candidate that is most similar to the tracked target. Extensive experimental
results on the benchmarks VOT-TIR 2015 and VOT-TIR 2016 show that our proposed

Majorana-like excitations in the condensed matter community. As a promising
candidate in this race, the one-dimensional chiral Majorana edge mode (CMEM) in
topological insulator-superconductor heterostructures has gathered renewed
interests during recent months after an experimental breakthrough. In this
paper, we study the quantum transport of topological insulator-superconductor
hybrid devices subject to light-matter interaction or general time-periodic
modulation. We report half-integer quantized conductance plateaus at
$\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ and $\frac{3}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ upon applying the
so-called sum rule in the theory of quantum transport in Floquet topological
matter. In particular, in a photoinduced topological superconductor sandwiched
between two Floquet Chern insulators, it is found that for each Floquet
sideband, the CMEM admits equal probability for normal transmission and local
Andreev reflection over a wide range of parameter regimes, yielding
half-integer quantized plateaus that resist static and time-periodic disorder.
The $\frac{3}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ plateau has not yet been computationally or
experimentally observed in any other superconducting system, and indicates the
possibility to simultaneously create and manipulate multiple pairs of CMEMs by
light. The robust half-quantized conductance plateaus, due to CMEMs at
quasienergies zero or half the driving frequency, are both fascinating and
subtle because they only emerge after a summation over contributions from all
Floquet sidebands. Such a distinctive transport signature can thus serve as a
hallmark of photoinduced CMEMs in topological insulator-superconductor
junctions.

Incremental SVD approaches are proposed to process newly changed nodes and
edges in dynamic networks. However, incremental SVD approaches suffer from
serious error accumulation inevitably due to approximation on incremental
updates. SVD restart is an effective approach to reset the aggregated error,
but when to restart SVD for dynamic networks is not addressed in literature. In
this paper, we propose TIMERS, Theoretically Instructed Maximum-Error-bounded
Restart of SVD, a novel approach which optimally sets the restart time in order
to reduce error accumulation in time. Specifically, we monitor the margin
between reconstruction loss of incremental updates and the minimum loss in SVD
model. To reduce the complexity of monitoring, we theoretically develop a lower
bound of SVD minimum loss for dynamic networks and use the bound to replace the
minimum loss in monitoring. By setting a maximum tolerated error as a
threshold, we can trigger SVD restart automatically when the margin exceeds
this threshold.We prove that the time complexity of our method is linear with
respect to the number of local dynamic changes, and our method is general
across different types of dynamic networks. We conduct extensive experiments on
several synthetic and real dynamic networks. The experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing
methods by reducing 27% to 42% in terms of the maximum error for dynamic
network reconstruction when fixing the number of restarts. Our method reduces
the number of restarts by 25% to 50% when fixing the maximum error tolerated.

molecules, this approach requires us to treat the entire donor aggregate as a
unified supermolecule, leading to potentially expensive quantum-chemical
calculations and making it more difficult to understand how the aggregate
components contribute to the overall transfer. Here, we show that it is
possible to describe charge transfer between groups of molecules in terms of
the properties of the constituent molecules and couplings between them,
obviating the need for expensive supermolecular calculations. We use the
resulting theory to show that charge delocalisation between molecules in either
the donor or acceptor aggregates can enhance the rate of charge transfer
through a process we call supertransfer (or suppress it through subtransfer).
The rate can also be enhanced above what is possible with a single molecule by
judiciously tuning energy levels and reorganisation energies. We also describe
bridge-mediated charge transfer between delocalised molecular aggregates. The
equations of generalised Marcus theory are in closed form, providing

engines? Knowing why people search for images is of major concern to Web image
search engines because user satisfaction may vary as intent varies. Previous
analyses of image search behavior have mostly been query-based, focusing on
what images people search for, rather than intent-based, that is, why people
search for images. To date, there is no thorough investigation of how different
image search intents affect users' search behavior.
  In this paper, we address the following questions: (1)Why do people search
for images in text-based Web image search systems? (2)How does image search
behavior change with user intent? (3)Can we predict user intent effectively
from interactions during the early stages of a search session? To this end, we
conduct both a lab-based user study and a commercial search log analysis.
  We show that user intents in image search can be grouped into three classes:
Explore/Learn, Entertain, and Locate/Acquire. Our lab-based user study reveals
different user behavior patterns under these three intents, such as first click
time, query reformulation, dwell time and mouse movement on the result page.
Based on user interaction features during the early stages of an image search
session, that is, before mouse scroll, we develop an intent classifier that is
able to achieve promising results for classifying intents into our three intent
classes. Given that all features can be obtained online and unobtrusively, the
predicted intents can provide guidance for choosing ranking methods immediately
after scrolling.

show that the stochastic dynamics of our model exhibit strong dependence on

such as motion synthesis, augmented reality, security, and autonomous vehicles.
Due to the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), there has

  We propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for probabilistic human motion
prediction, trained with a modified version of improved Wasserstein generative
adversarial networks (WGAN-GP), in which we use a custom loss function designed
for human motion prediction. Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a
probability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous
poses. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from
the same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random
distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic
predictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that
learns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion.
  We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and
Human3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its
predictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating
multiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input.
We show that most sequences generated from the same input have more than 50\%
probabilities of being judged as a real human sequence. We will release all the

variable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they
will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric
vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution
grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely
on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers
playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present
energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits
the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we
tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to
autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors,
operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive
platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy
with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production.
We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an
incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that
responds to both pro-sumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such
markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and
realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of
appropriate mechanisms and incentives.

microscopic mechanisms is still under debate. Here, we examine second harmonic
far-field radiation patterns over a wide angle from metallic structures with
different resonances, to reveal the structure-dependent contributions from
distinct nonlinear polarizations. By comparing the measured SHG radiation
patterns of 82 antennas with different SHG models, we demonstrate the critical
role of the surface-parallel and bulk nonlinear polarizations in the far-field

multi-resonator SHG model inside a single physical resonator is introduced to
explain and control the interplay between different nonlinear polarizations and
their structure-dependent excitations. Our findings offer a new strategy for
the design of highly efficient and directional nonlinear metamaterials.

obtained: (i) ResNet-18 training resulted in significant overfitting for
UCF-101, HMDB-51, and ActivityNet but not for Kinetics. (ii) The Kinetics
dataset has sufficient data for training of deep 3D CNNs, and enables training
of up to 152 ResNets layers, interestingly similar to 2D ResNets on ImageNet.
ResNeXt-101 achieved 78.4% average accuracy on the Kinetics test set. (iii)
Kinetics pretrained simple 3D architectures outperforms complex 2D
architectures, and the pretrained ResNeXt-101 achieved 94.5% and 70.2% on
UCF-101 and HMDB-51, respectively. The use of 2D CNNs trained on ImageNet has
produced significant progress in various tasks in image. We believe that using
deep 3D CNNs together with Kinetics will retrace the successful history of 2D
CNNs and ImageNet, and stimulate advances in computer vision for videos. The
codes and pretrained models used in this study are publicly available.

on these coordinates, we devise a data-driven framework for state estimation
using the Kalman filter. We demonstrate the strengths of our method with
respect to both parametric and non-parametric algorithms in three tracking
problems. In particular, applying the approach to actual recordings of
hippocampal neural activity in rodents directly yields a representation of the
position of the animals. We show that the proposed method outperforms competing
non-parametric algorithms in the examined stochastic problem formulations.
Additionally, we obtain results comparable to classical parametric algorithms,
which, in contrast to our method, are equipped with model knowledge.

passing through our Solar System on a hyperbolic orbit. This object was likely
dynamically ejected from an extrasolar planetary system after a series of close
encounters with gas giant planets. To account for 'Oumuamua's detection, simple
arguments suggest that ~1 Earth mass of planetesimals are ejected per Solar
mass of Galactic stars. However, that value assumes mono-sized planetesimals.
If the planetesimal mass distribution is instead top-heavy the inferred mass in
interstellar planetesimals increases to an implausibly high value. The tension
between theoretical expectations for the planetesimal mass function and the
observation of 'Oumuamua can be relieved if a small fraction (~0.1-1%) of
planetesimals are tidally disrupted on the pathway to ejection into
'Oumuamua-sized fragments. Using a large suite of simulations of giant planet
dynamics including planetesimals, we confirm that 0.1-1% of planetesimals pass
within the tidal disruption radius of a gas giant on their pathway to ejection.
'Oumuamua may thus represent a surviving fragment of a disrupted planetesimal.
Finally, we argue that an asteroidal composition is dynamically disfavoured for
'Oumuamua, as asteroidal planetesimals are both less abundant and ejected at a
lower efficiency than cometary planetesimals.

overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used

lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over

given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be
learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by
neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined
Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a
neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which
is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter
of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a
change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important
parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge
related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an
interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's
rule,which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method
on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of
learning an embedding for predicting $<$subject, predicate, object$>$ triplets.
We show state-of-the-art performance and, for the first time, the ability to
adapt the importance of the parameters based on unlabeled data towards what the

problem by using a randomized physics-based motion planner that permits
robot-object and object-object interactions. The main idea is to avoid an
explicit high-level reasoning of the task by providing the motion planner with
a physics engine to evaluate possible complex multi-body dynamical

also considering uncertainty in the objects pose and in the contact dynamics.
The work enhances the state validity checker, the control sampler and the tree
exploration strategy of a kinodynamic motion planner called KPIECE. The
enhanced algorithm, called p-KPIECE, has been validated in simulation and with
real experiments. The results have been compared with an ontological
physics-based motion planner and with task and motion planning approaches,
resulting in a significant improvement in terms of planning time, success rate

FlowGAN. This hierarchical approach brings more realistic videos with plausible
motion and appearance consistency. Our experiments show that our model
generates more plausible motion videos and also achieves significantly improved
performance for unsupervised action classification in comparison to previous

integrated and used in organizing the behavior of an animal is a central
question in neuroscience. The coherence of neuronal dynamics over different
scales has been suggested as a clue to the mechanisms underlying this
integration. Balanced excitation and inhibition may amplify microscopic
fluctuations to a macroscopic level, thus providing a mechanism for generating
coherent multiscale dynamics. Previous theories of brain dynamics, however,
were restricted to cases in which inhibition dominated excitation and
suppressed fluctuations in the macroscopic population activity. In the present
study, we investigate the dynamics of neuronal networks at a critical point
between excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant states. In these networks,
the microscopic fluctuations are amplified by the strong excitation and
inhibition to drive the macroscopic dynamics, while the macroscopic dynamics
determine the statistics of the microscopic fluctuations. Developing a novel
type of mean-field theory applicable to this class of interscale interactions,
we show that the amplification mechanism generates spontaneous, irregular
macroscopic rhythms similar to those observed in the brain. Through the same
mechanism, microscopic inputs to a small number of neurons effectively entrain
the dynamics of the whole network. These network dynamics undergo a
probabilistic transition to a coherent state, as the magnitude of either the
balanced excitation and inhibition or the external inputs is increased. Our
mean-field theory successfully predicts the behavior of this model.
Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that the coherent dynamics can be used
for state-dependent read-out of information from the network. These results
show a novel form of neuronal information processing that connects neuronal

These include the first ever measurements of $\phi$ meson production in p+p

dataset with respect to existing measurements. The comparison of p+p to Pb+Pb
collisions shows a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitudinal
evolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other
mesons. Furthermore, proton density fluctuations are investigated as a possible
order parameter of the second order phase transition in the neighbourhood of
the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. An intermittency
analysis is performed of the proton second scaled factorial moments in
transverse momentum space. A previous analysis of this sort revealed
significant power-law fluctuations for the ""Si""+Si system at 158A GeV measured
by the NA49 experiment. The fitted power-law exponent was consistent within
errors with the theoretically expected critical value, a result suggesting a
baryochemical potential in the vicinity of the CP of about 250 MeV. The
analysis will now be extended to NA61/SHINE systems of similar size, Be+Be and
Ar+Sc, at 150A GeV. Finally, spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) effects on
charged meson production are being studied and bring information on the
space-time position of the pion formation zone, which appears to be much closer

analytical formulas for the momentum-conserving part of the one-loop two-point
function of this theory in D-, 4-, and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces, which
are exact with respect to the noncommutative deformation parameter beta. We
prove that these integrals are regularized by the Snyder deformation. These
results indicate that the Snyder deformation does partially regularize the UV

Furthermore, it is observed that different nonassociative phi^4 products can
generate different momentum-conserving integrals. Finally most importantly, a
logarithmic infrared divergence emerges in one of these interaction terms. We
then analyze sample momentum nonconserving integral qualitatively and show that
it could exhibit IR divergence too. Therefore infrared divergences should
exist, in general, in the Snyder phi^4 theory. We consider infrared divergences
at the limit p -> 0 as UV-IR mixings induced by nonassociativity, since they
are associated to the matching UV divergence in the zero-momentum limit and
appear in specific types of nonassociative phi^4 products. We also discuss the

increases in $b\, m^2$ when the interface is tilted. For the continuous KPZ
equation $b = 1$ and the relation $\Lambda=\lambda$ is achieved. In this work,
we study the local fluctuations of the height gradient through an analysis of
the values of $b$. We show that, for 1-dimensional discrete KPZ models, $b$ has
a power-law dependence with the discretization step $s$ chosen to calculate the
height gradient and $b$ goes to $1$ as $s$ increases. Its power-law exponent
$\gamma_b$ matches the exponent associated with the finite-size corrections of
the interface average velocity, $\textit{i.e.}$ $\gamma_b=2(\zeta-1)$, where
$\zeta$ is the global roughness exponent. We also show how, for restricted
(unrestricted) growth models, the value of $b$ goes to $1$ from below (above)
as $s$ increases.

The adopted chemical evolution models are: i) the classical ""two-infall"" model

ii) and the ""one-infall"" model designed only for the thin disk evolution. We
tested the effects on the predicted fluorine abundance ratios of different

novae, even if their yields are still uncertain, could help to better reproduce

recurrent network models in which the connectivity is a sum of a random part

dynamics are low dimensional and can be directly inferred from connectivity
using a geometrical approach. We exploit this understanding to determine
minimal connectivity required to implement specific computations, and find that
the dynamical range and computational capacity quickly increase with the

transformation. A linear electro-optical birefringence effect evidences
collective fluctuations in the molecular tilt vector direction along the
confined helical superstructures, i.e. the Goldstone phason excitations typical
of the para-to-ferroelectric transition. Their relaxation frequencies increase
with the square of the inverse pore radii as characteristic of plane-wave
excitations and are two orders of magnitude larger than in the bulk, evidencing
an exceptionally fast electro-optical functionality of the
liquid-crystalline-AAO nanohybrids.

affects the interpretation of observations regarding the evolution of the
stellar mass loss during and after the most recent thermal pulse. We aim to
provide a new, independent measurement of the distance to R Sculptoris,
reducing the absolute uncertainty of the distance estimate to this source. R
Scl is a semi-regular pulsating star, surrounded by a thin shell of dust and
gas created during a thermal pulse approximately 2000 years ago. The stellar
light is scattered by the dust particles in the shell at a radius of 19 arcsec.
The variation in the stellar light affects the amount of dust-scattered light
with the same period and amplitude ratio, but with a phase lag that depends on
the absolute size of the shell. We measured this phase lag by observing the
star R Scl and the dust-scattered stellar light from the shell at five epochs
between June - December 2017. By observing in polarised light, we imaged the
shell in the plane of the sky, removing any uncertainty due to geometrical
effects. The phase lag gives the absolute size of the shell, and together with
the angular size of the shell directly gives the absolute distance to R
Sculptoris. We measured a phase lag between the stellar variations and the
variation in the shell of 40.0 +/- 4.0 days. The angular size of the shell is
measured to be 19.1 arcsec +/- 0.7 arcsec. Combined, this gives an absolute
distance to R Sculptoris of 361 +/- 44 pc. We independently determined the
absolute distance to R Scl with an uncertainty of 12%. The estimated distance
is consistent with previous estimates, but is one of the most accurate
distances to the source to date. In the future, using the variations in
polarised, dust-scattered stellar light, may offer an independent possibility
to measure reliable distances to AGB stars.

IRDCs are not completely understood and it is thus important to study their
molecular gas kinematics and chemical content to search for any signature of
the IRDCs formation process. Using the 30m-diameter antenna at the Instituto de
Radioastronom\'ia Milim\'etrica, we have obtained emission maps of dense gas
tracers (H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and HN$^{13}$C) and typical shock tracers (SiO and
CH$_3$OH) toward three IRDCs, G028.37+00.07, G034.43+00.24 and G034.77-00.55
(clouds C, F and G, respectively). We have studied the molecular gas kinematics
in these clouds and, consistent with previous works toward other IRDCs, the
clouds show complex gas kinematics with several velocity-coherent
sub-structures separated in velocity space by a few km s$^{-1}$. Correlated
with these complex kinematic structures, widespread (parsec-scale) emission of
SiO and CH$_3$OH is present in all the three clouds. For clouds C and F, known
to be actively forming stars, widespread SiO and CH$_3$OH is likely associated
with on-going star formation activity. However, for cloud G, which lacks either
8 $\mu$m or 24 $\mu$m sources and 4.5 $\mu$m H$_2$ shock-excited emission, the
detected widespread SiO and CH$_3$OH emission may have originated in a
large-scale shock interaction, although a scenario involving a population of
low-mass stars driving molecular outflows cannot be fully ruled out.

with tilted Dirac cones at two valleys. The tilting of the Dirac cones at two
valleys are in opposite direction, which manifests itself via valley dependent
Landau levels in presence of an in-plane electric field (Hall field). The
sensitivity of the Landau levels on valley index causes valley polarized
magnetotransport properties in presence of a Hall field, which is in contrast
to the monolayer graphene with isotropic non-tilted Dirac cones. The
longitudinal conductivity and Hall conductivity are evaluated by using linear
response theory in low temperature regime. An analytical approximate form of
longitudinal conductivity is also obtained to reveal how the tilting of the
Dirac cones affects the frequency of longitudinal conductivity oscillation
(Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation). On the other hand, Hall conductivity exhibits
graphene-like plateau excepts the appearance of valley dependent steps which is
purely attributed to the Hall field induced lifting valley degeneracy in Landau
levels. Another noticeable point is that if the real magnetic field is replaced
by the strain induced pseudo magnetic field then the electric field looses its
ability to cause valley polarized transport.

combining robust MR biomarkers for prostate cancer that can be reliably

non-dipole radiation of small to intermediate sized antennas are difficult.
Here we examine the antenna bandwidth cost associated with such constraints,
and in certain cases we design antennas that approach the bounds. Far-field
shaping is in particular interesting for Internet-of-things (IoT) and Wi-Fi
applications since e.g. spatial filtering can mitigate package loss through a
reduction of mutual interference, and hence increase the power efficiency of
the devices. Even a rather careful far-field shaping of smaller antennas can be
associated with a steep reduction in the best available bandwidth. It is thus
important to develop constraints that a small antenna can support. We describe
a power front-to-back ratio, and a related, beam-shaping constraint that can be
used in optimization for the minimum Q-factor. We show that such a non-convex
Q-factor optimization can be solved with the semi-definite relaxation
technique. We furthermore show that certain of the above optimized non-standard
radiation patterns can be realized with a multi-position feeding strategy with
a moderate loss of Q-factor: $Q_\text{antenna}\leq 1.61Q_\text{optimal}$.

the interactions. The model is based on an affordance network, i.e., a mapping
between robot actions, robot perceptions, and the perceived effects of these
actions upon objects. We extend the affordance model to incorporate spoken
words, which allows us to ground the verbal symbols to the execution of actions
and the perception of the environment. The model takes verbal descriptions of a
task as the input and uses temporal co-occurrence to create links between
speech utterances and the involved objects, actions, and effects. We show that
the robot is able form useful word-to-meaning associations, even without
considering grammatical structure in the learning process and in the presence
of recognition errors. These word-to-meaning associations are embedded in the
robot's own understanding of its actions. Thus, they can be directly used to
instruct the robot to perform tasks and also allow to incorporate context in
the speech recognition task. We believe that the encouraging results with our
approach may afford robots with a capacity to acquire language descriptors in
their operation's environment as well as to shed some light as to how this
challenging process develops with human infants.

similarities but also differences with its electronic counterpart. Here, we
investigate extensively this phenomenon using all-atom molecular dynamics of
ionic transport through nanopores of about one nanometer in diameter and up to
several nanometers in length. Our goal is to better understand the role of
atomic roughness and structure of the pore walls in the ionic Coulomb blockade.
Our numerical results reveal the following general trends. First, the nanopore
selectivity changes with its diameter, and the nanopore position in the
membrane influences the current strength. Second, the ionic transport through
the nanopore takes place in a hopping-like fashion over a set of discretized
states caused by local electric fields due to membrane atoms. In some cases,
this creates a slow-varying ""crystal-like"" structure of ions inside the
nanopore. Third, while at a given voltage, the resistance of the nanopore
depends on its length, the slope of this dependence appears to be independent
of the molarity of ions. An effective kinetic model that captures the ionic
Coulomb blockade behavior observed in MD simulations is formulated.

aspects of the patient treatment process in order to provide the right
assistance at the right time. Due to the breakthrough successes of deep
learning-based solutions for automatic image annotation, the availability of
reference annotations for algorithm training is becoming a major bottleneck in
the field. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the concept of
self-supervised learning to address this issue.
  Our approach is guided by the hypothesis that unlabeled video data can be
used to learn a representation of the target domain that boosts the performance
of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms when used for pre-training.
Core of the method is an auxiliary task based on raw endoscopic video data of
the target domain that is used to initialize the convolutional neural network
(CNN) for the target task. In this paper, we propose the re-colorization of
medical images with a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
as auxiliary task. A variant of the method involves a second pre-training step
based on labeled data for the target task from a related domain. We validate
both variants using medical instrument segmentation as target task.
  The proposed approach can be used to radically reduce the manual annotation
effort involved in training CNNs. Compared to the baseline approach of
generating annotated data from scratch, our method decreases exploratively the
number of labeled images by up to 75% without sacrificing performance. Our
method also outperforms alternative methods for CNN pre-training, such as
pre-training on publicly available non-medical or medical data using the target
task (in this instance: segmentation).
  As it makes efficient use of available (non-)public and (un-)labeled data,
the approach has the potential to become a valuable tool for CNN
(pre-)training.

manipulation of the incoming light beam. Because these structures are
ultrathin, less than a wavelength, this has the potential of achieving
ultrathin optical elements, with a thickness limited mainly by the mechanical
strength of the transparent substrate. Recently proposed metalenses are based
on either dielectric nanofin arrays, or nanoparticles of large number, which
leads to severe manufacturing challenges. To overcome these challenges, this
paper predicts a new type of metalens with concentric-nanoring topology, where
the number and size of the nanorings are determined using an inverse design
method. By focusing the electrical field energy at a specified position, the
convex-like metalens is inversely predicted with desired numerical aperture and
a diffraction-limited focal spot. The Poynting vector distribution found
demonstrates the mechanism of the lensing function, in which optical vortices
are generated in the nanorings to achieve a matching of the phase and impedance
between the substrate and free space, and further, to form a spherical
wavefront and enhance the transmission of the optical energy. The inverse
design method can also be extended to predict an axicon-like metalens with
focal beam. The improved manufacturability is concluded from the geometry of
the concentric-nanoring configurations.

it contains exactly $mn$ ones, and has at most one $1$ in each line. As a
special case, Latin boxes in which $m = n = k$ are equivalent to Latin squares.
  Let $\mathcal{M}(m,n,k;p)$ be the distribution on $m \times n \times k$ 0-1
arrays where each entry is $1$ with probability $p$, independently of the other
entries. The threshold question for Latin squares asks when
$\mathcal{M}(n,n,n;p)$ contains a Latin square with high probability. More
generally, when does $\mathcal{M}(m,n,k;p)$ support a Latin box with high
probability?
  Let $\varepsilon>0$. We give an asymptotically tight answer to this question
in the special cases where $n=k$ and $m \leq \left(1-\varepsilon \right) n$,
and where $n=m$ and $k \geq \left(1+\varepsilon \right) n$. In both cases, the
threshold probability is $\Theta \left( \log \left( n \right) / n \right)$.
This implies threshold results for Latin rectangles and proper edge-colorings

analogues for cometary materials which could be present at the surface of 67P.
Grain sizes of the powders range from tens of nanometres to hundreds of
micrometres. Some of the mixtures studied here actually reach the very low
reflectance level observed by VIRTIS on 67P. The best match is provided by a
mixture of sub-micron coal, pyrrhotite, and silicates. Grain sizes are in
agreement with the sizes of the dust particles detected by the GIADA, MIDAS and
COSIMA instruments on board Rosetta. The coal used in the experiment is
responsible for the spectral slope in the visible and infrared ranges.
Pyrrhotite, which is strongly absorbing, is responsible for the low albedo
observed in the NIR. The darkest components dominate the spectra, especially
within intimate mixtures. Depending on sample preparation, pyrrhotite can coat
the coal and silicate aggregates. Such coating effects can affect the spectra
as much as particle size. In contrast, silicates seem to play a minor role.

to the outer world. Generally speaking, it allows any piece of software to
retrieve the contents published at any web address at a certain point in time,
with complete and verifiable proof of its integrity and without blindly
trusting any third party. Witnet runs on a blockchain with a native protocol
token (called Wit), which miners-called witnesses-earn by retrieving, attesting
and delivering web contents for clients. On the other hand, clients spend Wit
to pay witnesses for their Retrieve-Attest-Deliver (RAD) work. Witnesses also
compete to mine blocks with considerable rewards, but Witnet mining power is
proportional to their previous performance in terms of honesty and
trustworthiness-this is, their reputation as witnesses. This creates a powerful
incentive for witnesses to do their work honestly, protect their reputation and
not to deceive the network. The Witnet protocol is designed to assign the RAD
tasks to witnesses in a way that mitigates most attack vectors to the greatest
extent. At the same time, it includes a novel 'sharding' feature that (1)
guarantees the efficiency and scalability of the network, (2) keeps the price
of RAD tasks within reasonable bounds and (3) gives clients the freedom to
adjust certainty and price by letting them choose how many witnesses will work
on their RAD tasks. When coupled with a Decentralized Storage Network (DSN),
Witnet also gives us the possibility to build the Digital Knowledge Ark: a
decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant and eternal archive of
humanity's most relevant digital data. A truth vault aimed to ensure that
knowledge will remain democratic and verifiable forever and to prevent history
from being written by the victors.

Because forming an aqueous interface requires termination of this network, one
might expect the molecular level properties of interfacial water to markedly
differ from water in bulk. Intriguingly, much prior experimental and
theoretical work has found that, from the perspective of their time-averaged
structure and picosecond structural dynamics, hydrogen-bonded OH groups at an
air/water interface behave the same as hydrogen-bonded OH groups in bulk liquid
water. Here we report the first experimental observation of interfacial water's
libration (i.e. frustrated rotation) using the laser-based technique
vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. We find this mode has a frequency of
834 cm$^{-1}$, $\approx 165$ cm$^{-1}$ higher than in bulk liquid water at the
same temperature and similar to bulk ice. Because libration frequency is
proportional to the stiffness of water's rotational potential, this increase
suggests that one effect of terminating bulk water's hydrogen bonding network
at the air/water interface is retarding rotation of water around intact
hydrogen bonds. Because in bulk liquid water the libration plays a key role in
stabilizing reaction intermediates and dissipating excess vibrational energy,
we expect the ability to probe this mode in interfacial water to open new
perspectives on the kinetics of heterogeneous reactions at aqueous interfaces.

acceleration are conducted in order to study the differences in electron plasma
wake field acceleration in MeV versus GeV and linear versus blowout regimes.
First, we show that caution needs to be taken when using fluid simulations, as
PIC simulations prove that an approximation for an electron bunch not to evolve
in time for few hundred plasma periods only applies when it is sufficiently
relativistic. This conclusion is true irrespective of the plasma temperature.
We find that in the linear regime and GeV energies, the accelerating electric
field generated by the plasma wake is similar to the linear and MeV regime.
However, because GeV energy driving bunch stays intact for much longer time,
the final acceleration energies are much larger in the GeV energies case. In
the GeV energy range and blowout regime the wake's accelerating electric field
is much larger in amplitude compared to the linear case and also plasma wake
geometrical size is much larger. Thus, the correct positioning of the trailing
bunch is needed to achieve the efficient acceleration. For the considered case,
optimally there should be approximately $(90-100) c/\omega_{pe}$ distance
between trailing and driving electron bunches in the GeV blowout regime.

performed the so far largest resonance-model fit, using Breit-Wigner resonances

evidence of the $a_1(1640)$ and $a_2(1700)$ in our data, which are the first
excitations of the $a_1(1260)$ and $a_2(1320)$, respectively. The relative

in Hamburg, Germany, on the asymmetry between positron-proton and
electron-proton elastic scattering cross sections. A non-zero asymmetry is
evidence of hard two-photon exchange, which has been hypothesized to cause the
discrepancy in measurements of the proton's electromagnetic form factors.
Alternating electron and positron beams, accelerated to 2 GeV, were directed
through a windowless, gaseous, hydrogen target, and the scattered lepton and
recoiling proton were detected in coincidence using a large acceptance magnetic
spectrometer. Determining the relative integrated luminosity between the
electron and positron data sets was critical, and a new technique, involving
multi-interaction events, was developed to achieve the desired sub-percent
accuracy. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation was built in order to reproduce the
convolution of systematic effects at every stage of the experiment. The first
stage in the simulation was new radiative event generator, which permitted the
full simulation of the non-trivial, radiative corrections to the measurement.
The analysis of the data and simulation showed that the lepton sign asymmetry
rises by several percent between a momentum transfer of 0.5 GeV$^2/c^2$ and
2.25 GeV$^2/c^2$. This rise as a function of increasing momentum transfer
confirms that two photon exchange at least partially contributes to the proton
form factor discrepancy.

field of radio astronomy. With the advent of astronomical instruments such as
he Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China, data
volumes and data rates are exponentially growing. This fact necessitates a
focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can perform the
automatic pulsar candidate identification to mine large astronomical data sets.
Automatic pulsar candidate identification can be considered as a task of
determining potential candidates for further investigation and eliminating
noises of radio frequency interferences or other non-pulsar signals. It is very
hard to raise the performance of DCNN-based pulsar identification because the
limited training samples restrict network structure to be designed deep enough
for learning good features as well as the crucial class imbalance problem due
to very limited number of real pulsar samples. To address these problems, we
proposed a framework which combines deep convolution generative adversarial
network (DCGAN) with support vector machine (SVM) to deal with imbalance class
problem and to improve pulsar identification accuracy. DCGAN is used as sample
generation and feature learning model, and SVM is adopted as the classifier for
predicting candidate's labels in the inference stage. The proposed framework is
a novel technique which not only can solve imbalance class problem but also can
learn discriminative feature representations of pulsar candidates instead of
computing hand-crafted features in preprocessing steps too, which makes it more
accurate for automatic pulsar candidate selection. Experiments on two pulsar
datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

arbitrary flat, homogeneous cosmological background with a number of matter
contents, both in early and late time epochs. The aim was to convert the system
of the equations of the motion to a first order autonomous dynamical system and
to find fixed points and attractors using numerical codes. For this purpose,
firstly we derive effective forms of cosmological field equations describing
the whole cosmic evolution history in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological
background and construct the autonomous system of the first order dynamical
equations. In addition, we investigate the local stability in the dynamical
systems called ""the stable/unstable manifold"" by introducing a specific form of
the interaction between matter, dark energy, radiation and a scalar field.
Furthermore, we explore the exact solutions of the cosmological equations in

solutions and show whether the de Sitter solutions can exist or not. Moreover,

complexity measures like Maximal Lyapunov and Hurst exponents and HHI index for
market concentration and Entropy, a measure of uncertainty and complexity in a
dynamical system, applied on the electricity wholesale marginal prices PUN and
SMP of Italy and Greece.Our aim is to measure the complexity and dimensionality
of the manifold on which the underlying stochastic dynamical system, govenring
the prices, evolve. We also use the conditional volatility of prices, which is
a measure of the market risk, and its connection with stability, and Hurst
exponent to investigate the properties of the fluctuations of the prices which
are the footprints of the idiosyncrracies of each market.

  parafoveal area","12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose
  To determine the influence on the contrast sensitivity when the stimulus
contains a fixation target in two retinal locations, foveal and parafoveal.
  Methods
  Four young adults with 0.0 logMar acuity participated in this study. The
stimulus was based on vertical sinusoidal gratings masked by a circular (for
foveal area) or a ring (for parafoveal area). To increase the luminance
resolution of the display a bit-stealing technique was used. Four different
sets of stimuli were generated, two for exploring the foveal sensitivity and
two for the parafoveal area. The difference between the sets designed for the
same area was the presence, or absence, of a fixation target (a white cross) in
the centre of the stimulus. A modified staircase method was implemented.
  Results
  The results show a drop in the contrast sensitivity when the fixation target
was present on the stimulus for frequencies smaller than 4 cycles per degree.
  Conclusions
  The presence of fixation targets diminishes the contrast sensitivity for low
to mid frequencies over different concentric areas of the retina. This could be
due to the fixational eye movements, different patterns of eye movements were
found using an eye tracker. The relationship between the sensitivity in the
foveal area and the parafoveal agrees with those reported by other authors
using different designs confirming that the new stimulus design is suitable to
measure the contrast sensitivity outside the foveal area.

  Ghosh, Shiv Ram Dubey","Local Jet Pattern: A Robust Descriptor for Texture Classification","Accepted in Multimedia Tools and Applications, Springer",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Methods based on local image features have recently shown promise for texture
classification tasks, especially in the presence of large intra-class variation
due to illumination, scale, and viewpoint changes. Inspired by the theories of
image structure analysis, this paper presents a simple, efficient, yet robust
descriptor namely local jet pattern (LJP) for texture classification. In this
approach, a jet space representation of a texture image is derived from a set
of derivatives of Gaussian (DtGs) filter responses up to second order, so
called local jet vectors (LJV), which also satisfy the Scale Space properties.
The LJP is obtained by utilizing the relationship of center pixel with the
local neighborhood information in jet space. Finally, the feature vector of a
texture region is formed by concatenating the histogram of LJP for all elements
of LJV. All DtGs responses up to second order together preserves the intrinsic
local image structure, and achieves invariance to scale, rotation, and
reflection. This allows us to develop a texture classification framework which
is discriminative and robust. Extensive experiments on five standard texture
image databases, employing nearest subspace classifier (NSC), the proposed
descriptor achieves 100%, 99.92%, 99.75%, 99.16%, and 99.65% accuracy for
Outex_TC-00010 (Outex_TC10), and Outex_TC-00012 (Outex_TC12), KTH-TIPS,
Brodatz, CUReT, respectively, which are outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

chiral phase. Using the Gross-Neveu models in 1+1 dimensions, we shall discuss
axial anomaly and nesting from two different points of view: one is homogeneous
chiral transition and the other is the Ferrel-Fulde-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
state in superconductivity, which are closely related to each other by way of
duality. It is shown that axial anomaly leads to a particular kind of the FFLO
state within the two dimensional Nambu-Jona Lasinio model, where axial anomaly
is manifested in a different mode. Nesting is a driving mechanism for both
phenomena, but its realization has different features. We reconsider the effect
of nesting in the context of duality.

and limited available radio spectrum on the other hand have made cognitive
radio (CR) a promising solution for future mobile networks. It has attracted
considerable attention by academia and industry since its introduction in 1999
and several relevant standards have been developed within the last decade.
Cognitive radio is based on four main functions, spanning across more than one
layer of OSI model. Therefore, solutions based on cognitive radio technology
require cross layer (CL) designs for optimum performance. This article briefly
reviews the basics of cognitive radio technology as an introduction and
highlights the need for cross layer design in systems deploying CR technology.
Then some of the published standards with CL characteristics are outlined in a
later section, and in the final section some research examples of cross layer
design ideas based on the existing CR standards conclude this article.
