stochasticity. Here we expand the theory of life history evolution to account
for the effects of finite population size on the evolution of pathogen
virulence. We show that demographic stochasticity introduces additional
evolutionary forces that can qualitatively affect the dynamics and the
evolutionary outcome. We discuss the importance of the shape of pathogen
fitness landscape and host heterogeneity on the balance between mutation,
selection and genetic drift. In particular, we discuss scenarios where finite
population size can dramatically affect classical predictions of deterministic
models. This analysis reconciles Adaptive Dynamics with population genetics in
finite populations and thus provides a new theoretical toolbox to study

plasma electron temperature, $T_{e,0} = m_{ion} v_0^2/k_B$ (where $m_{ion}$ is
the Rb$^+$ ion mass), as a function of the original Rydberg atom density and
binding energy, $E_{b,i}$. We have also simulated numerically the interaction
of UNPs with a large reservoir of Rydberg atoms to obtain data to compare with
our experimental results. We find that for Rydberg atom densities in the range
$10^7 - 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$, for states with principal quantum number $n > 40$,
$T_{e,0}$ is insensitive to the initial ionization mechanism which seeds the
plasma. In addition, the quantity $k_B \, T_{e,0}$ is strongly correlated with
the fraction of atoms which ionize, and is in the range $0.6 \times |E_{b,i}|

from Rydberg samples with $n \lesssim 40$ evolve with no significant additional
ionization of the remaining atoms once a threshold number of ions has been
established. The dominant interaction between the plasma electrons and the

open book, as introduced by Giroux, and of contact fiber bundle, as introduced
by Lerman. For instance, we give a definition of Bourgeois contact structures
on flat contact fiber bundles which is local, (strictly) includes the results

reinterpretation, inspired by an idea by Giroux, of supporting open books in

managed by social network platforms is modeled and investigated. A stochastic
multi-agent model for opinion dynamics is proposed, that accounts for a
centralized tuning of the strength of interaction between individuals. The
evolution of each individual opinion is described by a Markov chain, whose
transition rates are affected by the opinions of the neighbors through
influence parameters. The properties of this model are studied in a general
setting as well as in interesting special cases. A general result is that the
overall model of the social network behaves like a high-dimensional Markov
chain, which is viable to Monte Carlo simulation. Under the assumption of
identical agents and unbiased influence, it is shown that the influence
intensity affects the variance, but not the expectation, of the number of
individuals sharing a certain opinion. Moreover, a detailed analysis is carried
out for the so-called Peer Assembly, which describes the evolution of binary
opinions in a completely connected graph of identical agents. It is shown that
the Peer Assembly can be lumped into a birth-death chain that can be given a
complete analytical characterization. Both analytical results and simulation
experiments are used to highlight the emergence of particular collective
behaviours, e.g. consensus and herding, depending on the centralized tuning of

2.5 years. This timing campaign allowed a precise measurement of its spin
period (62.4 ms) and its derivative (9.6 $\pm$ 0.7) $\times 10^{-20}\, \rm s\,

surface magnetic field strength of 2.5 $\times 10^{9}$ G. These numbers
indicate that this pulsar was mildly recycled by accretion of matter from the
progenitor of the companion star. The system has an eccentric ($e\, = \, 0.17$)
2.61 day orbit. This eccentricity allows a highly significant measurement of
the rate of advance of periastron, $\dot{\omega} = 0.07686 \pm 0.00046

orbital motion, this implies a total system mass M = $2.538 \pm 0.022

pulsar mass is $1.62\, M_{\odot}$. The large companion mass and the orbital
eccentricity suggest that PSR J1411+2551 is a double neutron star system; the
lightest known to date including the DNS merger GW 170817. Furthermore, the
relatively low orbital eccentricity and small proper motion limits suggest that
the second supernova had a relatively small associated kick; this and the low

scalar (or low-dimensional vector) response quantities are insufficient and,
instead, full-field (very high-dimensional) responses are of interest. To do
so, an adaptive stochastic simulation-based methodology is introduced that
refines the probability space based on Grassmann manifold variations. The
proposed method has a multi-element character discretizing the probability
space into simplex elements using a Delaunay triangulation. For every simplex,
the high-dimensional solutions corresponding to its vertices (sample points)
are projected onto the Grassmann manifold. The pairwise distances between these
points are calculated using appropriately defined metrics and the elements with
large total distance are sub-sampled and refined. As a result, regions of the
probability space that produce significant changes in the full-field solution
are accurately resolved. An added benefit is that an approximation of the
solution within each element can be obtained by interpolation on the Grassmann
manifold without the need to develop a mathematical surrogate model. The method
is applied to study the probability of shear band formation in a bulk metallic
glass using the shear transformation zone theory.

layer near the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko with a
thermo-viscoelastic model. Such a layer could be formed by the recondensation
or sintering of water ice (and dust grains), as suggested by laboratory
experiments and computer simulations, and would explain the high compressive
strength encountered by experiments on board the Philae lander. Changes in
temperature from seasonal insolation variation penetrate into the comet's
surface to depths controlled by the thermal inertia, causing the material to
expand and contract. Modelling this with a Maxwellian viscoelastic response on
a spherical nucleus, we show that a hard, icy layer with similar properties to
Martian permafrost will experience high stresses: up to tens of MPa, which
exceed its material strength (a few MPa), down to depths of centimetres to a
metre. The stress distribution with latitude is confirmed qualitatively when
taking into account the comet's complex shape but neglecting thermal inertia.
Stress is found to be comparable to the material strength everywhere for
sufficient thermal inertia ($\gtrsim50$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) and ice
content ($\gtrsim 45\%$ at the equator). In this case, stresses penetrate to a

solve complex problems which may be considered as intractable for classical
computers. From a historic perspective, two independent approaches have been
pursued, namely, digital and analog quantum simulations. The former usually
provide universality and flexibility, while the latter allows for better
scalability. Here, we review recent literature merging both paradigms in the
context of superconducting circuits, yielding: digital-analog quantum
simulations. In this manner, we aim at getting the best of both approaches in
the most advanced quantum platform involving superconducting qubits and
microwave transmission lines. The discussed merge of quantum simulation

outperforming classical computers in relevant problems, enabling the reach of a

Important effects of the relative gauge angle between two identical superfluid
nuclei (symmetric collisions) on transfer probabilities and fusion barrier have
been uncovered. A theory making contact with experiments should at least
average over different initial relative gauge-angles. In the present work, we
propose a new approach to obtain the multiple pair transfer probabilities
between superfluid systems. This method, called Phase-Space combinatorial (PSC)
technique, relies both on phase-space averaging and combinatorial arguments to
infer the full pair transfer probability distribution at the cost of multiple
mean-field calculations only. After benchmarking this approach in a schematic
model, we apply it to the collision $^{20}$O+$^{20}$O at various energies below
the Coulomb barrier. The predictions for one pair transfer are similar to
results obtained with an approximated projection method whereas significant
differences are found for two pairs transfer. Finally, we investigated the
applicability of the PSC method to the contact between non-identical superfluid
systems. [...] The applicability of the PSC method to asymmetric nuclear
collisions is investigated for the $^{14}$O+$^{20}$O collision and it turns out
that unrealistically small single- and multiple-pair transfer probabilities are
obtained. [...] We conclude that the best ground for probing gauge-angle
effects in nuclear reaction and/or for applying the proposed PSC approach on

complexity theory suggests, small scale decisions of individuals form cities.
For this, we offer the first interpretation of entropy for cities that reflects
interactions between different places through interdependently linked states in
a multiscale approach. With simulated patterns we show that structural
complexity in spatial systems can be the most probable configuration if the
elements of a system interact across multiple scales. In the case study that
observes the distribution of functions in West London from 1875 to 2005, we can
partly explain the observed polycentric sprawl as a result of higher entropy
compared to spatially random spread, compact mixed use growth or fully
segregated patterns. This work contributes to understanding why cities are
morphologically complex, and describes a consistent relationship between
entropy and complexity that accounts for contradictions in the literature.
Finally, because we evaluate the constraints urban morphology imposes on
possible ways to use the city, the general framework of thinking could be
applied to adjust urban plans to the uncertainty of underlying assumptions in
planning practice.

show trends common for the umbra, light bridges, and the inner penumbra, while
the outer penumbra has a weaker magnetic field compared to the inner penumbra

the deflected plasma flow with the analytical solutions for compressible gas

their product $\phi_{\mu}\phi_{\lambda}$ to be mostly a linear combination of
eigenfunctions with eigenvalue close to $\lambda$. This can faily quite
dramatically: on $\mathbb{T}^2$, we see that $$ 2\sin{(n x)} \sin{((n+1) x)} =

adatoms is studied with the density functional theory approach. Within the
analysis the spin-orbit interaction is taken into account. We focus on the case
when the indicated $3d$ metallic adatoms form a perfect, close-packed
single-atomic layer above the graphene surface. The two configurations are
examined, namely the adatoms in the on-top, and the hollow positions on
graphene. First, we verify that the metallic adatoms in the close-packed
structure do not form a covalent bonds with the graphene substrate. However,
due to the proximity of the metallic adatoms to the graphene, the charge
transfer from the adatom layer to the graphene takes place, and in consequence
the graphene becomes $n$-doped. The observed charge transfer results from the
arising hybridization between the graphene $2p$ and transition metal $3d$
orbitals. The proximity of metallic adatoms modifies the magnetic state of the
graphene. This effect is especially pronounced for the decoration with magnetic
atoms, when the magnetic moments on the graphene sublattices are induced. The
analysis of the band structure demonstrates that the charge transfer, as well
as the induced magnetism on graphene, modify the graphene electronic properties
near high symmetry points, especially the Dirac cones. The presence of the
metallic adatoms breaks graphene $K-K^{'}$ symmetry and splits the bands due to
the exchange coupling. We show that for the hollow configuration the gap
opening arises at the $K(K^{'})$-point due to the Rashba-like spin-orbit
interaction, while in the case of the on-top configuration the energy gap opens
mainly due to the staggered potential. We also mapped the parameters of an
effective Hamiltonian on the results obtained with the density functional
theory approach.

Using algebra tools we investigate the degree distribution asymptotic behavior.
Analytic results show that the network nodes average degree converges if the
total mutation rate is greater than 0.5 and diverges otherwise. Treating
original and duplicated node mutation rates as independent parameters has no
effect on this result. However, difference in these parameters results in a
slower rate of convergence and in different degree distributions. The more

compare the solutions obtained with simulated networks. These results are in

compressible partially ionised plasma slab embedded in a uniform magnetic
field, modelling the state of the plasma in solar prominences. In the partially
ionised plasma, the dominant dissipative effect is the Cowling resistivity. The
regions outside the slab (modelling the solar corona) are fully ionised, and
the dominant mechanism of dissipation is viscosity. Analytical solutions to the
extended magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are found inside and outside of
the slab and solutions are matched at the boundaries of the slab. The
dispersion relation is derived and solutions are found analytically in the
slender slab limit, while the conditions necessary for the appearance of the
instability is investigated numerically for the entire parameter space. Our
study is focussed on the effect of the compressibility on the generation and
evolution of instabilities. We find that compressibility reduces the threshold
of the equilibrium flow, where waves can be unstable, to a level that is
comparable to the internal cusp speed, which is of the same order of flow
speeds that are currently observed in solar prominences. Our study addresses
only the slow waves, as these are the most likely perturbations to become
unstable, however the time-scales of the instability are found to be rather
large ranging from $10^5$-$10^7$ seconds. It is determined that the instability
threshold is further influenced by the concentration of neutrals and the
strength of the viscosity of the corona. Interestingly, these two latter
aspects have opposite effects. Our numerical analysis shows that the interplay
between the equilibrium flow, neutrals and dispersion can change considerably
the nature of waves.

different network architectures, model capacity and multiscale processing, and
show that many observations made on the task of classification do not always

inference in deep structured models, multiscale processing (and more generally,
input transformations) naturally implement recently proposed adversarial

how to effectively benchmark robustness and show which segmentation models

proton's electromagnetic form factors is striking, and suggests that two-photon
exchange (TPE) may be playing a larger role in elastic electron-proton
scattering than is estimated in standard radiative corrections formulae. While
TPE is difficult to calculate in a model-independent way, it can be determined
experimentally from asymmetries between electron-proton and positron-proton
scattering. The possibility of a polarized positron beam at Jefferson Lab would
open the door to measurements of TPE using polarization observables. In these
proceedings, I examine the feasibility of measuring three such observables with
positron scattering. Polarization-transfer, specifically the
$\epsilon$-dependence for fixed $Q^2$, is an excellent test of TPE, and the
ability to compare electrons and positrons would lead to a drastic reduction of
systematics. However, such a measurement would be severely statistically
limited. Normal single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) probe the imaginary part of the
TPE amplitude and can be improved by simultaneous measurements with electron
and positron beams. Beam-normal SSAs are too small to be measured with the
proposed polarized positron beam, but target-normal SSAs could be feasibly
measured with unpolarized positrons in the spectrometer halls. This technique
should be included in the physics case for developing a positron source for

time-space tradeoffs of algorithms. One of the classical results on the ROM
model is that any sorting algorithm that uses O(s) words of extra space
requires $\Omega (n^2/s)$ comparisons for $ \lg n \leq s \leq n/\lg n$ and the
bound has also been recently matched by an algorithm. However, if we relax the
model (from ROM), we do have sorting algorithms (say Heapsort) that can sort
using $O(n \lg n)$ comparisons using $O(\lg n)$ bits of extra space, even
keeping a permutation of the given input sequence at any point of time during
the algorithm.
  We address similar questions for graph algorithms. We show that a simple
natural relaxation of ROM model allows us to implement fundamental graph search
methods like BFS and DFS more space efficiently than in ROM. By simply allowing
elements in the adjacency list of a vertex to be permuted, we show that, on an
undirected or directed connected graph $G$ having $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,
the vertices of $G$ can be output in a DFS or BFS order using $O(\lg n)$ bits
of extra space and $O(n^3 \lg n)$ time. Thus we obtain similar bounds for
reachability and shortest path distance (both for undirected and directed
graphs). With a little more (but still polynomial) time, we can also output
vertices in the lex-DFS order. As reachability in directed graphs and shortest
path distance are NL-complete, and lex-DFS is P-complete, our results show that
our model is more powerful than ROM if L $\neq$ P. En route, we also introduce
and develop algorithms for another relaxation of ROM where the adjacency lists
of the vertices are circular lists and we can modify only the heads of the
lists. All our algorithms are simple but quite subtle, and we believe that
these models are practical enough to spur interest for other graph problems in

No such result is possible for the sphere $S^2$ or the flat torus $\mathbb

to zero weakly in $L^2(\gamma)$. Our proof consists of a further refinement of

to avoid geodesic rectangles on the universal cover of $M$. In contrast, we

coupling constant related to the $U(1)_X$ factor, $g_X$, in a certain value of
$\sin^2\theta_W $, arises only assuming that the condition to match the gauge
coupling constants of the standard model, $g_{2L}$, with that of the 3-3-1
model, $g_{3L}$, is valid for all energies. However, if we impose that this
matching condition is valid only at a given energy, say $\mu = M_Z$, the pole
arises when $\sin^2\theta_X(\mu_{LP})=1$, which is the only weak mixing angle
in the models. The value of $\mu_{LP} $ depends on the energy scales, $\mu_m$
and $\mu_{331}$, in which the matching and the 3-3-1 symmetry is fully
realized, respectively. We also show that $g_{2L} $ and $g_{3L} $ have
different running with energy. Therefore, differently from what is usually
assumed in the literature, these couplings can not be considered equal for all
energies. As a consequence, the fermion couplings with neutral vector bosons
are different if we write them in terms of $\sin\theta_X$ instead of
$\sin\theta_W $.

been used to powerfully boost the performance of first-order, gradient-based
parameter estimation in scenarios where second-order optimization strategies
are either inapplicable or impractical. Not only does accelerated gradient
descent converge considerably faster than traditional gradient descent, but it
also performs a more robust local search of the parameter space by initially
overshooting and then oscillating back as it settles into a final
configuration, thereby selecting only local minimizers with a basis of
attraction large enough to contain the initial overshoot. This behavior has
made accelerated and stochastic gradient search methods particularly popular
within the machine learning community. In their recent PNAS 2016 paper,
Wibisono, Wilson, and Jordan demonstrate how a broad class of accelerated
schemes can be cast in a variational framework formulated around the Bregman
divergence, leading to continuum limit ODE's. We show how their formulation may
be further extended to infinite dimension manifolds (starting here with the
geometric space of curves and surfaces) by substituting the Bregman divergence
with inner products on the tangent space and explicitly introducing a
distributed mass model which evolves in conjunction with the object of interest
during the optimization process. The co-evolving mass model, which is
introduced purely for the sake of endowing the optimization with helpful
dynamics, also links the resulting class of accelerated PDE based optimization
schemes to fluid dynamical formulations of optimal mass transport.

make a detailed study of the phenomenology of the $\varphi_{\eta}^*$ variable,

diagonalization scheme, and use them to numerically study the transition in
very large systems. To a large extent the results are in agreement with an
analytically tractable mean-field analysis of the scheme: We find that at the
critical point the system is almost surely localized in the thermodynamic
limit, hosting a set of thermal inclusions whose sizes are power-law
distributed. On the localized side the {\em typical} localization length is
bounded from above. The bound saturates upon approach to criticality, entailing
that a finite ergodic inclusion thermalizes a region of diverging diameter. The
dominant thermal inclusions have a fractal structure, implying that averaged
correlators decay as stretched exponentials throughout the localized phase.
Slightly on the ergodic side thermalization occurs through an avalanche
instability of the nearly localized bulk, whereby rare, supercritically large
ergodic spots eventually thermalize the entire sample. Their size diverges at
the transition, while their density vanishes. The non-local, avalanche-like
nature of this instability entails a breakdown of single parameter scaling and
puts the delocalization transition outside the realm of standard critical
phenomena.

this paper, we study the K-theoretic blowup equations for general local
Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find that both vanishing and unity blowup equations
exist for the partition function of refined topological string, and the crucial
ingredients are the $\bf r$ fields introduced in our previous paper. These
blowup equations are in fact the functional equations for the partition
function and each of them results in infinite identities among the refined free
energies. Evidences show that they can be used to determine the full refined
BPS invariants of local Calabi-Yau threefolds. This serves an independent and
sometimes more powerful way to compute the partition function other than the
refined topological vertex in the A-model and the refined holomorphic anomaly
equations in the B-model. We study the modular properties of the blowup
equations and provide a procedure to determine all the vanishing and unity $\bf
r$ fields from the polynomial part of refined topological string at large
radius point. We also find that certain form of blowup equations exist at
generic loci of the moduli space.

important role in regulating the Earth's climate, and may be better understood
by identifying rocky planets outside our solar system with tectonic activity.
The key criterion for whether or not plate tectonics may occur on a terrestrial
planet is if the stress on a planet's lithosphere from mantle convection may
overcome the lithosphere's yield stress. Although many rocky exoplanets closely
orbiting their host stars have been detected, all studies to date of plate
tectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses in the planet's
lithosphere. Modeling a rocky exoplanet as a constant density, homogeneous,
incompressible sphere, we show the tidal stress from the host star acting on
close-in planets may become comparable to the stress on the lithosphere from
mantle convection. We also show that tidal stresses from planet-planet
interactions are unlikely to be significant for plate tectonics, but may be
strong enough to trigger Earthquakes. Our work may imply planets orbiting close
to their host stars are more likely to experience plate tectonics, with
implications for exoplanetary geophysics and habitability. We produce a list of
detected rocky exoplanets under the most intense stresses. Atmospheric and
topographic observations may confirm our predictions in the near future.
Investigations of planets with significant tidal stress can not only lead to
observable parameters linked to the presence of active plate tectonics, but may
also be used as a tool to test theories on the main driving force behind
tectonic activity.

cluster's potential well may undergo physical processes that are driven by the
large-scale characteristics of the galaxy clusters, it is possible that the
growth of these BHs is (indirectly) governed by the properties of their host

residing in the brightest group/cluster galaxies (BGGs/BCGs) and the virial

this end, we investigate a sample of 17 BGGs/BCGs with dynamical BH mass

temperatures and infer the $M_{\rm 500}$ mass of the galaxy groups/clusters. We
find that the $M_{\rm BH} - kT$ relation is significantly tighter and exhibits
smaller scatter than the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\rm bulge}$ relations. The
best-fitting power-law relations are $ \log_{10} (M_{\rm BH}/10^{9} \

physical processes that are governed by the properties of the host galaxy
group/cluster. These results are confronted with the Horizon-AGN simulation,
which reproduces the observed relations well, albeit the simulated relations
exhibit notably smaller scatter.

quantities in galaxies, including their number density, star formation rate

mapping probes, e.g. SPHEREx and CDIM, will observe galaxies in H-alpha
emission over a large fraction of the sky from the local Universe till a
redshift of z ~ 6 to 10, respectively. This will also be the target line for
observations by the high-resolution Euclid and WFIRST instruments in the z ~
0.7 - 2 redshift range. In this paper, we estimate the intensity and power
spectra of the H-alpha line in the z ~ 0 - 5 redshift range using observed line
luminosity functions (LFs), when possible, and simulations, otherwise. We
estimate the significance of our predictions by accounting for the modelling
uncertainties (e.g. SFR, extinction, etc.) and observational contamination. We
find that Intensity Mapping (IM) surveys can make a statistical detection of
the full H-alpha emission between z ~ 0.8 - 5. Moreover, we find that the
high-frequency resolution and the sensitivity of the planned CDIM surveys allow
for the separation of H-alpha emission from several interloping lines. We
explore ways to use the combination of these line intensities to probe galaxy
properties. As expected, our study indicates that galaxy surveys will only
detect bright galaxies that contribute up to a few percent of the overall
H-alpha intensity. However, these surveys will provide important constraints on
the high end of the H-alpha LF and put strong constraints on the AGN LF.

passive, non-emission line cluster galaxies drawn from 110 galaxy clusters. The
galaxy clusters were selected using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in the
2500~deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey and cover the redshift range $0.2 < z < 1.3$. We
model the clusters using the Jeans equation, while adopting NFW mass profiles
and a broad range of velocity dispersion anisotropy profiles. The data prefer
velocity dispersion anisotropy profiles that are approximately isotropic near
the center and increasingly radial toward the cluster virial radius, and this
is true for all redshifts and masses we study. The pseudo-phase-space density
profile of the passive galaxies is consistent with expectations for dark matter
particles and subhalos from cosmological $N$-body simulations. The dynamical
mass constraints are in good agreement with external mass estimates of the SPT
cluster sample from either weak lensing, velocity dispersions, or X-ray $Y_X$
measurements. However, the dynamical masses are lower (at the 2.2$\sigma$
level) when compared to the mass calibration favored when fitting the SPT
cluster data to a $\Lambda$CDM model with external cosmological priors,
including CMB anisotropy data from Planck. The discrepancy grows with redshift,
where in the highest redshift bin the ratio of dynamical to SPT+Planck masses
is $\eta=0.63^{+0.13}_{-0.08}\pm0.06$ (statistical and systematic),
corresponding to a $2.6\sigma$ discrepancy.

partially outlines a wake downstream of Vela X-1. To substantiate this

between Vela X-1 and the layer for three limiting cases. Namely, we run
simulations in which (i) the stellar wind and the interstellar medium (ISM)
were treated as pure hydrodynamic flows, (ii) a homogeneous magnetic field was
added to the ISM, while the stellar wind was assumed to be unmagnetized, and
(iii) the stellar wind was assumed to possess a helical magnetic field, while
there was no magnetic field in the ISM. We found that although the first two

thought to be the progenitors of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.
However, the way they accrete their mass is still an unsolved problem. In
particular, for accretion to proceed, a large amount of angular momentum has to
be extracted from the collapsing gas. Here, we investigate the constraints
stellar evolution imposes on this angular momentum problem. We present an
evolution model of a supermassive Population III star including simultaneously
accretion and rotation. We find that, for supermassive stars to form by
accretion, the accreted angular momentum has to be about 1% of the Keplerian
angular momentum. This tight constraint comes from the $\Omega\Gamma$-limit, at
which the combination of radiation pressure and centrifugal force cancels
gravity. It implies that supermassive stars are slow rotators, with a surface
velocity less than 10-20% of their first critical velocity, at which the
centrifugal force alone cancels gravity. At such low velocities, the
deformation of the star due to rotation is negligible.

Traditional denoising methods, such as principal component analysis and

Furthermore, these methods are computationally expensive on large datasets. To

TeV arise in numerous extensions of the Standard Model (SM). Decays of such a
vector into a pair of SM particles, either fermions or EW bosons, are well
studied. Many of these models have an additional scalar, which can lead to (and
even dominate in certain parameter regions) a novel decay channel for the heavy
vector particles instead - into a SM EW boson and the scalar, which
subsequently decays into a SM EW boson pair. In this work, we focus on the
scalar being relatively heavy, roughly factor of two lighter than the vector
particles, rendering its decay products well separated. Such a cascade decay
results in a final state with three isolated bosons. We argue that for this
""triboson"" signal the existing diboson searches are not quite optimal due to
combinatorial ambiguity for three identical bosons, and in addition, due to a
relatively small signal cross-section determined by the heaviness of the
decaying vector particle. In order to isolate the signal, we demonstrate that
tagging all three bosons, followed by use of the full triboson invariant mass
distribution as well as that of appropriate subsets of dibosons, is well
motivated. We develop these general strategies in detail within the context of
a specific class of models that are based on extensions of the standard warped
extra-dimensional scenario. We also point out that a similar analysis would
apply to models with an enlarged EW gauge sector in four dimensions, even if

stars between 50 and 200 kpc could be associated with distant Magellanic
debris. Indeed, without the VVDS, there are very few BHBs in the remaining
portions of the Galaxy probed by the HSC. Accordingly, this scarcity of tracers
is consistent with a significant decline in stellar density beyond 50 kpc, with
a power-law of -4 or steeper.

From an initial set of 212 AGN+companion systems, identified with the help of
Galaxy Zoo participants, we obtained long-slit optical spectra of 32 pairs
which were a priori likely to show cross-ionization based on projected
separation or angular extent of the companion. From emission-line ratios, 10 of
these systems are candidates for cross-ionization, roughly the fraction
expected if most AGN have ionization cones with 70-degree opening angles. Among
these, Was 49 remains the strongest nearby candidate. NGC 5278/9 and UGC 6081
are dual-AGN systems with tidal debris, complicating identification of
cross-ionization. The two weak AGN in the NGC 5278/9 system ionize gas
filaments to a projected radius 14 kpc from each galaxy. In UGC 6081, an
irregular high-ionization emission region encompasses both AGN, extending more
than 15 kpc from each. The observed AGN companion galaxies with and without
signs of external AGN photoionization have similar distributions in estimated
incident AGN flux, suggesting that geometry of escaping radiation or long-term
variability control this facet of the AGN environment. This parallels
conclusions for luminous QSOs based on the proximity effect among Lyman-alpha
absorbers. In some galaxies, mismatch between spectroscopic classifications in
the common BPT diagram and the intensity of weaker He II and [Ne V] emission

algebraically construct observables of interacting CFTs using free fields
without the need to explicitly construct an underlying RG flow. In this note,
we begin to extend this idea to higher dimensions by showing that one can
compute certain observables of an infinite set of unitary strongly interacting

performing simple calculations involving sets of non-unitary free
four-dimensional hypermultiplets. These free fields are distant cousins of the
Majorana fermion underlying the two-dimensional Ising model and are not
obviously connected to our interacting theories via an RG flow. Rather
surprisingly, this construction gives us Lagrangians for particular observables
in certain subsectors of many ""non-Lagrangian"" SCFTs by sacrificing unitarity
while preserving the full $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra. As a
byproduct, we find relations between characters in unitary and non-unitary

in a covert manner makes ear recognition technology an appealing choice for
surveillance and security applications as well as related application domains.
In contrast to other biometric modalities, where large datasets captured in
uncontrolled settings are readily available, datasets of ear images are still
limited in size and mostly of laboratory-like quality. As a consequence, ear
recognition technology has not benefited yet from advances in deep learning and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is still lacking behind other
modalities that experienced significant performance gains owing to deep
recognition technology. In this paper we address this problem and aim at
building a CNNbased ear recognition model. We explore different strategies
towards model training with limited amounts of training data and show that by
selecting an appropriate model architecture, using aggressive data augmentation
and selective learning on existing (pre-trained) models, we are able to learn
an effective CNN-based model using a little more than 1300 training images. The
result of our work is the first CNN-based approach to ear recognition that is
also made publicly available to the research community. With our model we are
able to improve on the rank one recognition rate of the previous

shapes the chemistry of interstellar regions; yet measurements of diffusion in

diffusion into CO$_2$ ice at low temperatures (T=11--23~K) using CO$_2$
longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes to monitor the level of mixing of
initially layered ices. We model the diffusion kinetics using Fick's second law
and find the temperature dependent diffusion coefficients are well fit by an
Arrhenius equation giving a diffusion barrier of 300 $\pm$ 40 K. The low
barrier along with the diffusion kinetics through isotopically labeled layers
suggest that CO diffuses through CO$_2$ along pore surfaces rather than through
bulk diffusion. In complementary experiments, we measure the desorption energy
of CO from CO$_2$ ices deposited at 11-50 K by temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) and find that the desorption barrier ranges from 1240 $\pm$ 90
K to 1410 $\pm$ 70 K depending on the CO$_2$ deposition temperature and
resultant ice porosity. The measured CO-CO$_2$ desorption barriers demonstrate
that CO binds equally well to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O ices when both are compact. The
CO-CO$_2$ diffusion-desorption barrier ratio ranges from 0.21-0.24 dependent on
the binding environment during diffusion. The diffusion-desorption ratio is
consistent with the above hypothesis that the observed diffusion is a surface
process and adds to previous experimental evidence on diffusion in water ice
that suggests surface diffusion is important to the mobility of molecules

where the cost function depends on uncertain problem parameters that need to be
learned from data. Earlier work proposed prescriptive formulations based on
supervised machine learning methods. These prescriptive methods can factor in
contextual information on a potentially large number of covariates to take
context specific actions which are superior to any static decision. When
working with noisy or corrupt data, however, such nominal prescriptive methods
can be prone to adverse overfitting phenomena and fail to generalize on
out-of-sample data. In this paper we combine ideas from robust optimization and
the statistical bootstrap to propose novel prescriptive methods which safeguard
against overfitting. We show indeed that a particular entropic robust
counterpart to such nominal formulations guarantees good performance on
synthetic bootstrap data. As bootstrap data is often a sensible proxy to actual
out-of-sample data, our robust counterpart can be interpreted to directly
encourage good out-of-sample performance. The associated robust prescriptive
methods furthermore reduce to convenient tractable convex optimization problems
in the context of local learning methods such as nearest neighbors and
Nadaraya-Watson learning. We illustrate our data-driven decision-making
framework and our novel robustness notion on a small newsvendor problem.

massive, compact, relic galaxies MRK 1216 and PGC 032873. Compact massive
galaxies observed at z>2, also called red nuggets, formed in quick dissipative
events and later grew by dry mergers into the local giant ellipticals. Due to
the stochastic nature of mergers, a few of the primordial massive galaxies
avoided the mergers and remained untouched over cosmic time. We find that the
hot atmosphere surrounding MRK 1216 extends far beyond the stellar population
and has an 0.5-7 keV X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm X}=(7.0\pm0.2)\times10^{41}$
erg s$^{-1}$, which is similar to the nearby X-ray bright giant ellipticals.
The hot gas has a short central cooling time of $\sim50$ Myr and the galaxy has
a $\sim13$ Gyr old stellar population. The presence of an X-ray atmosphere with
a short nominal cooling time and the lack of young stars indicate the presence
of a sustained heating source, which prevented star formation since the
dissipative origin of the galaxy 13 Gyrs ago. The central temperature peak and
the presence of radio emission in the core of the galaxy indicate that the
heating source is radio-mechanical AGN feedback. Given that both MRK 1216 and
PGC 032873 appear to have evolved in isolation, the order of magnitude
difference in their current X-ray luminosity could be traced back to a
difference in the ferocity of the AGN outbursts in these systems. Finally, we
discuss the potential connection between the presence of hot halos around such
massive galaxies and the growth of super/over-massive black holes via chaotic
cold accretion.

functions are calculated by accelerated Stokesian Dynamics simulations where
hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are fully accounted for. The study spans the
range from the short-time to the colloidal long-time regime. Additionally,
Brownian Dynamics simulation and mode-coupling theory (MCT) results are
generated where HIs are neglected. It is shown that HIs enhance collective and
self-diffusion at intermediate and long times, whereas at short times
self-diffusion, and for certain wavenumbers also collective diffusion, are
slowed down. MCT significantly overestimate the slowing influence of dynamic
particle caging. The simulated scattering functions are in decent agreement
with our dynamic light scattering (DLS) results for suspensions of charged
silica spheres. Simulation and theoretical results are indicative of a
long-time exponential decay of the intermediate scattering function. The
approximate validity of a far-reaching time-wavenumber factorization of the
scattering function is shown to be a consequence of HIs. Our study of
collective diffusion is amended by simulation and theoretical results for the
self-intermediate scattering function and the particle mean squared
displacement (MSD). Since self-diffusion is not assessed in DLS measurements, a
method to deduce the MSD approximately in DLS is theoretically validated.

results show that the initial dimensionless pericenter distance systematically
decreases with the binary component masses and the mass of the central
supermassive black hole, and its distribution depends sensitively on the
highest possible black hole mass in the nuclear star cluster. For a multi-mass
black hole population with masses between 5 Msun and 80 Msun, we find that
between 43-69% (68-94%) of 30 Msun - 30 Msun (10 Msun - 10 Msun) sources have
an eccentricity greater than 0.1 when the gravitational-wave signal reaches 10
Hz, but less than 10% of the sources with binary component masses less than 30
Msun remain eccentric at this level near the last stable orbit (LSO). The
eccentricity at LSO is typically between 0.005-0.05 for the lower-mass BHs, and
0.1 - 0.2 for the highest-mass BHs. Thus, due to the limited low-frequency
sensitivity, the six currently known quasi-circular LIGO/Virgo sources could
still be compatible with this originally highly eccentric source population.
However, at the design sensitivity of these instruments, the measurement of the
eccentricity and mass distribution of merger events may be a useful diagnostic
to identify the fraction of GW sources formed in this channel.

of phenomenological approaches such as quark models or, more recently,
computer-based calculations using Lattice QCD. However, the unique properties
of heavy quarkonium systems allow an entire calculation in terms of
non-relativistic perturbative QCD. In this work, the bottomonium spectrum, up
to $n = 3$, and the ground state charmonium states, are analyzed in the
framework of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics at N$^3$LO. For
bottomonium, finite charm quark mass effects in the QCD potential and the
$\overline{MS}$-pole mass relation are incorporated to the highest known order,
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^3)$ in the $\Upsilon$-scheme counting. The bottom
quark pole mass is expressed in terms of the MSR mass, a low-scale
short-distance mass which cancels the $u = 1/2$ renormalon of the static
potential. We study the $n_\ell = 3$ and $n_\ell = 4$ schemes, finding a
negligible difference between the two if finite $m_c$ effects are smoothly
incorporated in the MSR mass definition. We find that bottomonium $n=3$ states
are not well behaved within perturbative NRQCD. Hence, fitting to the $n=1,2$
$b\bar b$ states we obtain $\overline{m}_b(\overline{m}_b) = 4.216\pm 0.039$

for secure wireless communication under some simple and practical conditions.
In particular, we consider the fields of secrecy capacity of a wireless channel

single-antenna eavesdroppers (Eves) from unknown locations, where Alice and Bob
have zero knowledge (except a model) of the large-scale-fading
channel-state-information of Eves. These properties show how the secrecy
capacity is distributed in terms of the location of any Eve, how the optimal
jamming power applied by the full-duplex radio varies with various parameters,
and how bad or good the worst cases are. In particular, these properties show
how the quality of self-interference cancelation/suppression affects various
aspects of the fields of secrecy capacity. The cases of colluding Eves and
non-colluding Eves are treated separately and yet coherently. For non-colluding
Eves, asymptotically constant fields of secrecy capacity are revealed. For each
of the two cases, we also treat subcases with or without small-scale fading.

3$_{21}$-2$_{20}$/3$_{03}$-2$_{02}$ and 4$_{22}$-3$_{21}$/4$_{04}$-3$_{03}$

91 $\pm$ 4 K. Deduced $T_{\rm kin}$ values from the $J$ = 3-2 and 4-3

10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$. A comparison of kinetic temperatures derived from p-H$_2$CO,
NH$_3$, and the dust emission indicates that p-H$_2$CO traces a distinctly
higher temperature than the NH$_3$ (2,2)/(1,1) transitions and the dust,
tracing heated gas more directly associated with the star formation process.
The H$_2$CO linewidths are found to be correlated with bolometric luminosity
and increase with the evolutionary stage of the clumps, which suggests that
higher luminosities tend to be associated with a more turbulent molecular
medium. It seems that the spatial densities measured with H$_2$CO do not vary
significantly with the evolutionary stage of the clumps. However, averaged gas
kinetic temperatures derived from H$_2$CO increase with time through the
evolution of the clumps.

the amount of quality data growing fast. However, in order to better take
advantage of this moment, data analysis tools have to keep up the pace.
Understanding the effect of baryonic matter on the large-scale structure is one
of the challenges to be faced in cosmology. In this work, we have thoroughly
studied the effect of baryonic physics on different lensing statistics. Making
use of the Magneticum Pathfinder suite of simulations we show that the
influence of luminous matter on the 1-point lensing statistics of point sources
is significant, enhancing the probability of magnified objects with $\mu>3$ by
a factor of $2$ and the occurrence of multiple-images by a factor $5-500$
depending on the source redshift and size. We also discuss the dependence of
the lensing statistics on the angular resolution of sources. Our results and
methodology were carefully tested in order to guarantee that our uncertainties
are much smaller than the effects here presented.

clusters of galaxies by utilizing the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of
clustered galaxies jointly with weak lensing inferred masses. More
specifically, we solve the spherical Jeans equation by assuming a simple
relation between the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the radial velocity
dispersion and recast the Jeans equation as a Bernoulli differential equation
that has a well-known analytic solution. We first test our method in
cosmological N-body simulations and then derive the anisotropy profiles for 35
archival data galaxy clusters with an average redshift of $\langle
{z}_{c}\rangle =0.25$. The resulting profiles yield a weighted average global
value of $\langle \beta (0.2\leqslant R/{R}_{200}\leqslant 1)\rangle =0.35\pm
0.28$ (stat) \pm 0.15 (sys). This indicates that clustered galaxies tend to
globally fall on radially anisotropic orbits. We note that this is the first
attempt to derive velocity anisotropy profiles for a cluster sample of this

learning in both full and partial information settings. The differential
privacy framework is, at heart, less about privacy and more about algorithmic
stability, and thus has found application in domains well beyond those where
information security is central. Here we develop an algorithmic property called
one-step differential stability which facilitates a more refined regret
analysis for online learning methods. We show that tools from the differential
privacy literature can yield regret bounds for many interesting online learning
problems including online convex optimization and online linear optimization.
Our stability notion is particularly well-suited for deriving first-order
regret bounds for follow-the-perturbed-leader algorithms, something that all
previous analyses have struggled to achieve. We also generalize the standard
max-divergence to obtain a broader class called Tsallis max-divergences. These
define stronger notions of stability that are useful in deriving bounds in
partial information settings such as multi-armed bandits and bandits with
experts.

the latter providing a lower resistance current carrying channel. The

an opportunity to investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated
over cosmic time. In particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements
(chromium, manganese, iron and nickel) is key to understanding how the
progenitors of typical type Ia supernovae evolve and explode. Recent X-ray
studies of the intracluster medium found that the abundance ratios of these
elements differ substantially from those seen in the Sun, suggesting
differences between the nature of type Ia supernovae in the clusters and in the
Milky Way. However, because the K-shell transition lines of chromium and
manganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very close in photon
energy, high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate determination
of the abundances of these elements. Here we report observations of the Perseus
cluster, with statistically significant detections of the resonance emission
from chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined with the latest
atomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios with
respect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our results
and modern nucleosynthesis calculations disfavours the hypothesis that type Ia
supernova progenitors are exclusively white dwarfs with masses well below the
Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed
abundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into
account a combination of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova
systems, adding to the mounting evidence that both progenitor types make a

Building effective priors is however challenged by the low train and test
overhead dictated by real-time tasks; and the need for retrieving visually
""plausible"" and physically ""feasible"" images with minimal hallucination. To
cope with these challenges, we design a cascaded network architecture that
unrolls the proximal gradient iterations by permeating benefits from generative
residual networks (ResNet) to modeling the proximal operator. A mixture of
pixel-wise and perceptual costs is then deployed to train proximals. The
overall architecture resembles back-and-forth projection onto the intersection
of feasible and plausible images. Extensive computational experiments are
examined for a global task of reconstructing MR images of pediatric patients,
and a more local task of superresolving CelebA faces, that are insightful to
design efficient architectures. Our observations indicate that for MRI
reconstruction, a recurrent ResNet with a single residual block effectively
learns the proximal. This simple architecture appears to significantly
outperform the alternative deep ResNet architecture by 2dB SNR, and the
conventional compressed-sensing MRI by 4dB SNR with 100x faster inference. For
image superresolution, our preliminary results indicate that modeling the
denoising proximal demands deep ResNets.

different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located
above the SFR-M* main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion
times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the
main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales
typical of starbursts of ~150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the far
infrared and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star
formation rates estimated using UV-optical-NIR data alone underestimate the
total star formation rate. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead
the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of
star-formation before they become passive. Being Herschel-selected, these main
sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence
we do not know whether these ""starbursts hidden in the main sequence"" also
exist below 10^11 Msun. Active galactic nuclei are found to be ubiquitous in

while preserving the tridiagonal matrix structure of the classical single-layer

method is presented for each of the three classical time discretisation

that to ensure stability of the forward Euler scheme it is not sufficient that
the time step $\tau$ satisfies the classical constraint of $\tau\leq
h_{i}^2/(2D_{i})$ in each layer (where $D_{i}$ is the diffusivity and $h_{i}$

a framework for risk-sensitive IRL in order to explicitly account for a human's

a wide range of qualitatively different driving styles from highly risk-averse

The droplet dynamics and collisions are approximated using a superparticle
approach. In the absence of gravity, we show that the time evolution of the
shape of the droplet-size distribution due to turbulence-induced collisions
depends strongly on the turbulent energy-dissipation rate, but only weakly on
the Reynolds number. This can be explained through the energy dissipation rate
dependence of the mean collision rate described by the Saffman-Turner collision
model. Consistent with the Saffman-Turner collision model and its extensions,
the collision rate increases as the square root of the energy dissipation rate
even when coalescence is invoked. The size distribution exhibits power law
behavior with a slope of -3.7 between a maximum at approximately 10 um up to
about 40 um. When gravity is invoked, turbulence is found to dominate the time
evolution of an initially monodisperse droplet distribution at early times. At
later times, however, gravity takes over and dominates the collisional growth.
We find that the formation of large droplets is very sensitive to the turbulent
energy dissipation rate. This is due to the fact that turbulence enhances the
collisional growth between similar sized droplets at the early stage of
raindrop formation. The mean collision rate grows exponentially, which is
consistent with the theoretical prediction of the continuous collisional growth
even when turbulence-generated collisions are invoked. This consistency only
reflects the mean effect of turbulence on collisional growth.

the August, 1914 capture and imprisonment of the members of a German eclipse
expedition that had gone to the Crimea to look, at the request of Einstein, for
bending of starlight by the sun. And it ended in 1919 with the
Eddington-inspired measurements of that light bending from Principe and Sobral
and with the founding of the International Astronomical Union by scientists
from ""the countries at war with the Central Powers."" In between came
unprecedented, and in some ways unequaled, death and destruction. The
scientists lost were mostly too young to have made an impact (Henry Moseley and
Karl Schwarzschild are exceptions), but many of the best-known of the next
generation had, if citizens of the belligerent countries, served on the battle
lines, and most of the rest contributed in some other way. It may come as a
surprise to find that both theoretical physics and observational astronomy of
relevance to general relativity continued to take place and that there was a
certain amount of communication of results, information, and even goods in both
directions. The early post-war years saw something of a flowering of the
subject, before the majority of physicists turned their attention to quantum
mechanics and astronomers to stellar physics, though both had already been
under consideration during the war. War-based bitterness between French and
German scholars was surely part of the context in which Einstein and Henri
Bergson faced off on 6 April 1922, in a debate on the nature of time, as part
of an Einsteinian visit to Paris that had originally been planned for Fall,
1914.

localized structures. Previous findings have shown that such localized
structures can self-replicate in a binary fashion, where a single vegetation
patch elongates and divides into two new patches. Here, we extend these
previous results by considering the more general case, where the plants
interact non-locally, this extension adds an extra level of complexity and
shrinks the gap between the model and real ecosystems, where it is known that
the plant-to-plant competition through roots and above-ground facilitating
interactions have non-local effects, i.e. they extend further away than the
nearest neighbor distance. Through numerical simulations, we show that for a
moderate level of aridity, a transition from a single patch to periodic pattern
occurs. Moreover, for large values of the hydric stress, we predict an opposing
route to the formation of periodic patterns, where a homogeneous cover of
vegetation may decay to spot-like patterns. The evolution of the biomass of
vegetation patches can be used as an indicator of the state of an ecosystem,
this allows to distinguish if a system is in a self-replicating or decaying
dynamics. In an attempt to relate the theoretical predictions to real
ecosystems, we analyze landscapes in Zambia and Mozambique, where vegetation
forms patches of tens of meters in diameter. We show that the properties of the
patches together with their spatial distributions are consistent with the

comprehensive comparison of statistical quantities such as energy dissipation
rates and boundary layer thickness scales. Data are used from three simulation
run series at Prandtl numbers $Pr$ that cover two orders of magnitude. In
contrast to most previous studies in RBC the focus of the present work is on
convective turbulence at very low Prandtl numbers including $Pr=0.021$ for
liquid mercury or gallium and $Pr=0.005$ for liquid sodium. In this parameter
range of RBC, inertial effects cause a dominating turbulent momentum transport
that is in line with highly intermittent fluid turbulence both in the bulk and
in the boundary layers and thus should be able to trigger a transition to the
fully turbulent boundary layers of the ultimate regime of convection for higher
Rayleigh number. Secondly, we predict the ranges of Rayleigh numbers for which
the viscous boundary layer will transition to turbulence and the flow as a
whole will cross over into the ultimate regime. These transition ranges are
obtained by extrapolation from our simulation data. The extrapolation methods
are based on the large-scale properties of the velocity profile. Two of the
three methods predict similar ranges for the transition to ultimate convection

structure functions, and they are related to the generalized distribution
functions (GPDs) by the $s$-$t$ crossing of the Mandelstam variables. The GDA
studies provide information on three-dimensional tomography of hadrons. The
GDAs can be investigated by the two-photon process $\gamma^* \gamma \to h\bar
h$, and the GPDs are studied by the deeply virtual Compton scattering $\gamma^*
h \to \gamma h$. The GDA studies had been pure theoretical topics, although the
GPDs have been experimentally investigated, because there was no available
experimental measurement. Recently, the Belle collaboration reported their
measurements on the $\gamma^* \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ differential cross
section, so that it became possible to find the GDAs from their measurements.
Here, we report our analysis of the Belle data for determining the pion GDAs.
From the GDAs, the timelike gravitational form factors $\Theta_1 (s)$ and
$\Theta_2 (s)$ can be calculated, which are mechanical (pressure, shear force)
and mass (energy) form factors, respectively. They are converted to the
spacelike form factors by using the dispersion relation, and then gravitational
radii are evaluated for the pion. The mass and mechanical radii are obtained
from $\Theta_2$ and $\Theta_1$ as $\sqrt {\langle r^2 \rangle_{\text{mass}}}

parametrized algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(3^{d})$, and its space complexity
is $\mathcal{O}(nk)$, where $d$ is the depth and $k$ is the width of the given

hate speech discourse which has led to calls for improved detection methods.
Most of these rely on annotated data, keywords, and a classification technique.
While this approach provides good coverage, it can fall short when dealing with
new terms produced by online extremist communities which act as original
sources of words which have alternate hate speech meanings. These code words
(which can be both created and adopted words) are designed to evade automatic
detection and often have benign meanings in regular discourse. As an example,
""skypes"", ""googles"", and ""yahoos"" are all instances of words which have an
alternate meaning that can be used for hate speech. This overlap introduces
additional challenges when relying on keywords for both the collection of data
that is specific to hate speech, and downstream classification. In this work,
we develop a community detection approach for finding extremist hate speech
communities and collecting data from their members. We also develop a word
embedding model that learns the alternate hate speech meaning of words and
demonstrate the candidacy of our code words with several annotation
experiments, designed to determine if it is possible to recognize a word as
being used for hate speech without knowing its alternate meaning. We report an
inter-annotator agreement rate of K=0.871, and K=0.676 for data drawn from our
extremist community and the keyword approach respectively, supporting our claim
that hate speech detection is a contextual task and does not depend on a fixed
list of keywords. Our goal is to advance the domain by providing a high quality
hate speech dataset in addition to learned code words that can be fed into

visibility of a background scene and degrade an image considerably. In this
paper, we address the problem by visually removing raindrops, and thus
transforming a raindrop degraded image into a clean one. The problem is
intractable, since first the regions occluded by raindrops are not given.
Second, the information about the background scene of the occluded regions is
completely lost for most part. To resolve the problem, we apply an attentive
generative network using adversarial training. Our main idea is to inject
visual attention into both the generative and discriminative networks. During
the training, our visual attention learns about raindrop regions and their
surroundings. Hence, by injecting this information, the generative network will
pay more attention to the raindrop regions and the surrounding structures, and
the discriminative network will be able to assess the local consistency of the
restored regions. This injection of visual attention to both generative and
discriminative networks is the main contribution of this paper. Our experiments
show the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the state of the art

Edge-Cloud computing system, in which computing service providers at the edge
of the Internet (edge providers) and computing service providers at the cloud
(cloud providers) co-exist and collectively provide computing resources to
clients (e.g., end users or applications) at the edge. Different from
traditional cloud computing, the providers in an Edge-Cloud system are
independent and self-interested. To achieve high system-level efficiency, the
manager of the system adopts a task distribution mechanism to maximize the
total revenue received from clients and also adopts a revenue sharing mechanism
to split the received revenue among computing servers (and hence service
providers). Under those system-level mechanisms, service providers attempt to
game with the system in order to maximize their own utilities, by strategically
allocating their resources (e.g., computing servers).
  Our framework models the competition among the providers in an Edge-Cloud
system as a non-cooperative game. Our simulations and experiments on an
emulation system have shown the existence of Nash equilibrium in such a game.
We find that revenue sharing mechanisms have a significant impact on the
system-level efficiency at Nash equilibria, and surprisingly the revenue
sharing mechanism based directly on actual contributions can result in
significantly worse system efficiency than Shapley value sharing mechanism and
Ortmann proportional sharing mechanism. Our framework provides an effective
economics approach to understanding and designing efficient Edge-Cloud
computing systems.

$-1.6$ dB. Discrete-time algorithms are presented for timing and carrier
synchronization, as well as channel estimation, for turbo coded multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM)
systems. Simulation results show that it is possible to achieve a bit error
rate of $10^{-5}$ at an average SNR per bit of 5.5 dB, using two transmit and
two receive antennas. We then propose a near-capacity signaling method in which
each transmit antenna uses a different carrier frequency. Using the
near-capacity approach, we show that it is possible to achieve a BER of
$2\times 10^{-5}$ at an average SNR per bit of just 2.5 dB, with one receive
antenna for each transmit antenna. When the number of receive antennas for each
transmit antenna is increased to 128, then a BER of $2\times 10^{-5}$ is
attained at an average SNR per bit of 1.25 dB. In all cases, the number of
transmit antennas is two and the spectral efficiency is 1 bit/transmission or 1
bit/sec/Hz. In other words, each transmit antenna sends 0.5 bit/transmission.
It is possible to obtain higher spectral efficiency by increasing the number of
transmit antennas, with no loss in BER performance, as long as each transmit
antenna uses a different carrier frequency. The transmitted signal spectrum for
the near-capacity approach can be restricted by pulse-shaping. In all the
simulations, a four-state turbo code is used. The corresponding turbo decoder
uses eight iterations. The algorithms can be implemented on programmable

computational intractability of direct application of 3D convolutional nets to
3D volumetric data severely limits the efficiency (i.e. slow processing) and
effectiveness (i.e. unsatisfied accuracy) in processing 3D geometric data. In
this paper, powered with a novel design of adversarial networks (3D-A-Nets), we
have developed a novel 3D deep dense shape descriptor (3D-DDSD) to address the
challenging issues of efficient and effective 3D volumetric data processing. We
developed new definition of 2D multilayer dense representation (MDR) of 3D
volumetric data to extract concise but geometrically informative shape
description and a novel design of adversarial networks that jointly train a set

with correct class label, whereas the discriminator network discourages the
clustering by assigning them misleading adversarial class labels. By addressing
the challenges posed by the computational inefficiency of direct application of
CNN to 3D volumetric data, 3D-A-Nets can learn high-quality 3D-DSDD which
demonstrates superior performance on 3D shape classification and retrieval over

which are crucial for the automaton's performance, is relatively difficult due
to the necessity of a manual parameter tuning before real applications. To
ensure a stable and reliable performance in stochastic environments, parameter
tuning can be a time-consuming and interaction-costing procedure in the field
of LA. Especially, it is a fatal limitation for LA-based applications where the
interactions with environments are expensive.
  In this paper, we propose a parameter-free learning automaton scheme to avoid
parameter tuning by a Bayesian inference method. In contrast to existing
schemes where the parameters should be carefully tuned according to the
environment, the performance of this scheme is not sensitive to external
environments because a set of parameters can be consistently applied to various
environments, which dramatically reduce the difficulty of applying a learning
automaton to an unknown stochastic environment. A rigorous proof of
$\epsilon$-optimality for the proposed scheme is provided and numeric
experiments are carried out on benchmark environments to verify its
effectiveness. The results show that, without any parameter tuning cost, the
proposed parameter-free learning automaton (PFLA) can achieve a competitive
performance compared with other well-tuned schemes and outperform untuned
schemes on consistency of performance.

follows: 3/4. The differential-geometric aspects of this answer moreover
generalize to numerous variant problems.
  Hopf mathematics additionally gives a general bundle section interpretation
to Kendall's iconic spherical blackboard of vertex-unlablelled
mirror-image-identified triangles, and of its two variants where one of these
two conditions are dropped. We attribute a monopole to each of these spaces and
to the full shape sphere, one due to Dirac, one to Iwai and the other two are
new to this paper. We finally make insightful comparison of triangles in 2-$d$
with a) Part II's 4 points on the line. b) Triangles in 3-$d$, which are
particularly significant as the smallest model exhibiting stratification.
Stratified manifold-sheaf pairs - sheaves adding useful local and global
structure to general bundles - lie at the heart of Shape Theory's future
development.

domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key
insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity
information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and
clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer
learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints,
which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not.
This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source
domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for
performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for
unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize
classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering
network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs.
Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen
categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of
semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity
network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show
that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and
unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of
the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and
ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high
accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using
images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both
datasets. Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we
combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.

approach to understanding and controlling the mechanism (""AF driver"") is to
quantify inter-scale information flow from macroscopic to microscopic behaviors
of the cardiac system as a surrogate for the downward causation of the AF
driver. We use a numerical model of a cardiac system with one of the potential
AF drivers, a rotor, the rotation center of spiral waves, and generate a
renormalization group with system descriptions at multiple scales. We find that
transfer entropy accurately quantifies the upward and downward information flow
between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of the cardiac system with
spiral waves. Because the spatial profile of transfer entropy and intrinsic
transfer entropy is identical, there are no synergistic effects in the system.
We also find that inter-scale information flow significantly decreases as the
description of the system becomes more macroscopic. The downward information
flow is significantly smaller than the upward information flow. Lastly, we find
that downward information flow from macroscopic to microscopic descriptions of
the cardiac system is significantly correlated with the number of rotors, but
the higher number of rotors is not necessarily associated with a higher
downward information flow. This result contradicts the concept that the rotors
are the AF driver, and may account for the conflicting evidence from clinical
studies targeting rotors as the AF driver.

Thick-restart Lanczos is a popular restarted variant because of its simplicity
and numerically robustness. However, convergence can be slow for highly
clustered eigenvalues so more effective restarting techniques and the use of
preconditioning is needed. In this paper, we present a thick-restart
preconditioned Lanczos method, TRPL+K, that combines the power of locally

the thick-restart Lanczos method. TRPL+K employs an inner-outer scheme where
the inner loop applies Lanczos on a preconditioned operator while the outer
loop augments the resulting Lanczos subspace with certain vectors from the
previous restart cycle to obtain eigenvector approximations with which it thick
restarts the outer subspace. We first identify the differences from various
relevant methods in the literature. Then, based on an optimization perspective,
we show an asymptotic global quasi-optimality of a simplified TRPL+K method

domain of latitude and longitude variables of fatal crash data are
significantly unpredictable. This unpredictability, caused by the randomness of
fatal crash incidents, reduces the accuracy of crash frequency (i.e., counts of
fatal crashes per cluster) which is used to measure traffic safety in practice.
In this paper, a quantitative measure of traffic safety that is not
significantly affected by the aforementioned variability is proposed. It
introduces a fatal point -- a segment with the highest frequency of fatality --
concept based on cluster characteristics and detects them by imposing rounding
errors to the hundredth decimal place of the longitude. The frequencies of the
cluster and the cluster's fatal point are combined to construct a low-sensitive
quantitative measure of traffic safety for the cluster. The performance of the
proposed measure of traffic safety is then studied by varying the parameter k
of k-means clustering with the expectation that other clustering techniques can
be adopted in a similar fashion. The 2015 North Carolina fatal crash dataset of
Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is used to evaluate the proposed
fatal point concept and perform experimental analysis to determine the
effectiveness of the proposed measure. The empirical study shows that the
average traffic safety, measured by the proposed quantitative measure over
several clusters, is not significantly affected by the variability, compared to
that of the standard crash frequency.

over rings $S$ graded by a unique product monoid. We consider two situations in
detail: (a) the case where $S$ is strongly group-graded and (b) the case where
$S$ is a crossed product and the ideal or module is induced from the identity
component $R$ of $S$. We give explicit conditions for ideals and modules of $R$
to induce prime ideals of or prime modules over $S$ in these two cases. We then
describe the set of associated prime ideals of an arbitrary induced module.
  One of our main interests is to give necessary and sufficient conditions for
primeness, and to describe the associated primes, in the crossed product case
when the action of the monoid is not an action by automorphisms; this includes
the case of a skew polynomial ring $R[x;\sigma]$ where $\sigma$ is an
endomorphism of $R$.
  At the end, we give some illustrative examples, several of which show the

Classification (CTC) criterion was shown as a natural end-to-end model directly
targeting words as output units. However, this type of word-based CTC model
suffers from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue as it can only model limited
number of words in the output layer and maps all the remaining words into an
OOV output node. Therefore, such word-based CTC model can only recognize the
frequent words modeled by the network output nodes. It also cannot easily
handle the hot-words which emerge after the model is trained. In this study, we
improve the acoustic-to-word model with a hybrid CTC model which can predict
both words and characters at the same time. With a shared-hidden-layer
structure and modular design, the alignments of words generated from the
word-based CTC and the character-based CTC are synchronized. Whenever the
acoustic-to-word model emits an OOV token, we back off that OOV segment to the
word output generated from the character-based CTC, hence solving the OOV or
hot-words issue. Evaluated on a Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, the
proposed model can reduce the errors introduced by the OOV output token in the
acoustic-to-word model by 30%.

The explicit background invariance of our action is in contrast with earlier

Existing network embedding methods mainly focus on networks with pairwise
relationships. In real world, however, the relationships among data points
could go beyond pairwise, i.e., three or more objects are involved in each
relationship represented by a hyperedge, thus forming hyper-networks. These
hyper-networks pose great challenges to existing network embedding methods when
the hyperedges are indecomposable, that is to say, any subset of nodes in a

especially common in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
Deep Hyper-Network Embedding (DHNE) model to embed hyper-networks with
indecomposable hyperedges. More specifically, we theoretically prove that any
linear similarity metric in embedding space commonly used in existing methods
cannot maintain the indecomposibility property in hyper-networks, and thus

for example, for the readout of a highly packed spin based quantum memory or
the detection of unlabeled metalloproteins in a single cell. In conventional
EPR spectrometers, the energy transfer from the spins to the cavity at a
Purcell enhanced rate plays an essential role and requires the spins to be
resonant with the cavity, however the size of the cavity (limited by the
wavelength) makes it difficult to improve the spatial resolution. Here, we
demonstrate a novel EPR spectrometer using a single artificial atom as a
sensitive detector of spin magnetization. The artificial atom, a
superconducting flux qubit, provides advantages both in terms of its quantum
properties and its much stronger coupling with magnetic fields. We have
achieved a sensitivity of $\sim$400 spins/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with a magnetic
sensing volume around $10^{-14} \lambda^3$ (50 femto-liters). This corresponds
to an improvement of two-order of magnitude in the magnetic sensing volume

""local"" nature can be adapted to the distributed setting given a legal graph
coloring. The running time of the distributed algorithm will then be at least
the number of colors. Surprisingly, this well known idea was never formally
stated as a unified framework. In this paper we aim to define a robust family
of local sequential algorithms which can be easily adapted to the distributed
setting. We then develop new tools to further enhance these algorithms,
achieving state of the art results for fundamental problems.
  We define a simple class of greedy-like algorithms which we call
\emph{orderless-local} algorithms. We show that given a legal $c$-coloring of
the graph, every algorithm in this family can be converted into a distributed
algorithm running in $O(c)$ communication rounds in the CONGEST model. We show
that this family is indeed robust as both the method of conditional
expectations and the unconstrained submodular maximization algorithm of
Buchbinder \etal \cite{BuchbinderFNS15} can be expressed as orderless-local
algorithms for \emph{local utility functions} --- Utility functions which have
a strong local nature to them.
  We use the above algorithms as a base for new distributed approximation
algorithms for the weighted variants of some fundamental problems: Max $k$-Cut,
Max-DiCut, Max 2-SAT and correlation clustering. We develop algorithms which
have the same approximation guarantees as their sequential counterparts, up to
a constant additive $\epsilon$ factor, while achieving an $O(\log^* n)$ running
time for deterministic algorithms and $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ running time for

configuration about the interactions between atoms and heat baths. Using
secular approximation, the conventional master equation usually neglects
steady-state coherence, even when the system is coupled with a non-equilibrium
environment. When employing the master equation with no secular approximation,
we find that the system coherence in our model, denoted by the off-diagonal
terms in the reduced density matrix spanned by the eigenvectors of the system
Hamiltonian, would survive after a long-time decoherence evolution. The
absolute value of residual coherence in the system relies on different
configurations of interaction channels between the system and the heat baths.
We find that a large steady quantum coherence term can be achieved when the two
atoms are resonant. The absolute value of quantum coherence decreases in the
presence of additional atom-bath interaction channels. Our work sheds new light
on the mechanism of steady-state coherence in microscopic quantum systems in
non-equilibrium environments.

the time dependence of the integrated charge-current distribution in the plasma
cloud, the longitudinal shower structure, is determined by interesting physics
which one would like to extract such as the location and multiplicity of the
primary cosmic-ray collision or the values of electric fields in the atmosphere
during thunderstorms. To extract the structure of a shower from its footprint
requires solving a complicated inverse problem. For this purpose we have
developed a code that semi-analytically calculates the radio footprint of an

be used in a optimization procedure to extract the optimal longitudinal shower
structure given a radio footprint. On the basis of air-shower universality we
propose a simple parametrization of the structure of the plasma cloud. This
parametrization is based on the results of Monte-Carlo shower simulations.
Deriving the parametrization also teaches which aspects of the plasma cloud are
important for understanding the features seen in the radio-emission footprint.

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for under-resolved turbulence computations.
In particular we consider the inviscid Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) flow to
analyse the implicit large eddy simulation (iLES) capabilities of DG methods at
very high Reynolds numbers. The governing equations are discretised in two ways
in order to suppress aliasing errors introduced into the discrete variational
forms due to the under-integration of non-linear terms. The first, more
straightforward way relies on consistent/over-integration, where quadrature
accuracy is improved by using a larger number of integration points, consistent
with the degree of the non-linearities. The second strategy, originally applied
in the high-order finite difference community, relies on a split (or
skew-symmetric) form of the governing equations. Different split forms are
available depending on how the variables in the non-linear terms are grouped.
The desired split form is then built by averaging conservative and
non-conservative forms of the governing equations, although conservativity of
the DG scheme is fully preserved. A preliminary analysis based on Burgers'
turbulence in one spatial dimension is conducted and shows the potential of
split forms in keeping the energy of higher-order polynomial modes close to the
expected levels. This indicates that the favourable dealiasing properties
observed from split-form approaches in more classical schemes seem to hold for
DG. The remainder of the study considers a comprehensive set of
(under-resolved) computations of the inviscid TGV flow and compares the
accuracy and robustness of consistent/over-integration and split form
discretisations based on the local Lax-Friedrichs and Roe-type Riemann
solvers...

However, the sensors maybe faulty and thus generate inaccurate data which would
compromise the decision making. To guarantee the QoS, the system should be able
to detect faulty sensors so as to eliminate the damages of inaccurate data.
Various faulty sensor detection mechanisms have been developed in the context
of wireless sensor network (WSN). Some of them are only fit for WSN while the
others would bring a communication burden to control center. To detect the
faulty sensors for general IoT applications and save the communication resource
at the same time, an efficient faulty sensor detection scheme is proposed in
this paper. The proposed scheme takes advantage of fog computing to save the
computation and communication resource of control center. To preserve the
privacy of sensor data, the Paillier Cryptosystem is adopted in the fog
computing. The batch verification technique is applied to achieve efficient
authentication. The performance analyses are presented to demonstrate that the
proposed detection scheme is able to conserve the communication resource of
control center and achieve a high true positive ratio while maintaining an
acceptable false positive ratio. The scheme could also withstand various
security attacks and preserve data privacy.

additional participating nodes (or sensors) (e.g., to verify the location of

trimethylamine from C3H9N isomeric group are the most viable candidates for the
future astronomical detection. Based on our quantum chemical calculations and
from other approximations (from prevailing similar types of reactions), a
complete set of reaction pathways to the synthesis of ethylamine and

employed to study the presence of these species in the ISM. Our modeling
results suggest that ethylamine and (1Z)-1-propanimine could efficiently be
formed in hot-core regions and could be observed with present astronomical

their discovery in interstellar space.

  variables",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In small sample studies with binary outcome data, use of a normal
approximation for hypothesis testing can lead to substantial inflation of the
type-I error-rate. Consequently, exact statistical methods are necessitated,
and accordingly, much research has been conducted to facilitate this. Recently,
this has included methodology for the design of two-stage multi-arm studies
utilising exact binomial tests. These designs were demonstrated to carry
substantial efficiency advantages over a fixed sample design, but generally
suffered from strong conservatism. An alternative classical means of small
sample inference with dichotomous data is Fisher's exact test. However, this
method is limited to single-stage designs when there are multiple arms.
Therefore, here, we propose a two-stage version of Fisher's exact test, with
the potential to stop early to accept or reject null hypotheses, which is
applicable to multi-arm studies. In particular, we provide precise formulae
describing the requirements for achieving weak or strong control of the
familywise error-rate with this design. Following this, we describe how the
design parameters may be optimised to confer desirable operating
characteristics. For a motivating example based on a phase II clinical trial,
we demonstrate that on average our approach is less conservative than
corresponding optimal designs based on exact binomial tests.

interactions is that the results do not depend on the shape of the

three body bound states with wave function localized near the barycenter and
less localized four-body bound states. For some range of masses there is an
infinity of bound states with energies which accumulate geometrically to zero
(Efimov effect). For contact interactions these are all the bound states which
can be present in the $N$-body system. We study of zero range hamiltonians by
first compactly embedding the physical space $ L^2(R^{3 (N-1)}) $ in a larger
Hilbert space of more singular functions (Krein space) Estimates are done in
the auxiliary space, where strong resolvent convergence when $ \epsilon \to 0$
and spectral properties are easily established. If the hamiltonian \emph{in
Krein space} is positive, coming back to $L^2 (R^{3N})$ is done using the
compactness of the Krein map and the fact that for positive forms weak
convergence implies strong convergence. If it is not positive we use a somewhat
more sophisticated operation, $ \Gamma-$convergence [Dal]. In both cases the

single value. However, real-world systems often rely on interactions of
polyadic nature, where multiple values are communicated among two or more
parties, like multicast, scatter-gather, and atomic exchanges. We introduce a
new model for choreographic programming equipped with a primitive for grouped

interactions can be thought of as being carried out as one single interaction.
In practice, they are implemented by processes that carry them out in a

task of processing nested arithmetic expressions, and study whether different
types of neural networks can learn to compute their meaning. We find that
recursive neural networks can find a generalising solution to this problem, and
we visualise this solution by breaking it up in three steps: project, sum and
squash. As a next step, we investigate recurrent neural networks, and show that
a gated recurrent unit, that processes its input incrementally, also performs
very well on this task. To develop an understanding of what the recurrent
network encodes, visualisation techniques alone do not suffice. Therefore, we
develop an approach where we formulate and test multiple hypotheses on the
information encoded and processed by the network. For each hypothesis, we
derive predictions about features of the hidden state representations at each
time step, and train 'diagnostic classifiers' to test those predictions. Our
results indicate that the networks follow a strategy similar to our
hypothesised 'cumulative strategy', which explains the high accuracy of the
network on novel expressions, the generalisation to longer expressions than
seen in training, and the mild deterioration with increasing length. This is
turn shows that diagnostic classifiers can be a useful technique for opening up
the black box of neural networks. We argue that diagnostic classification,
unlike most visualisation techniques, does scale up from small networks in a
toy domain, to larger and deeper recurrent networks dealing with real-life
data, and may therefore contribute to a better understanding of the internal

rankings of objects represented as feature vectors, the goal is to learn a
ranking function that predicts a linear order of any new set of objects. In
this paper, we propose a new approach to object ranking based on principles of
analogical reasoning. More specifically, our inference pattern is formalized in
terms of so-called analogical proportions and can be summarized as follows:
Given objects $A,B,C,D$, if object $A$ is known to be preferred to $B$, and $C$
relates to $D$ as $A$ relates to $B$, then $C$ is (supposedly) preferred to
$D$. Our method applies this pattern as a main building block and combines it
with ideas and techniques from instance-based learning and rank aggregation.
Based on first experimental results for data sets from various domains (sports,
education, tourism, etc.), we conclude that our approach is highly competitive.
It appears to be specifically interesting in situations in which the objects
are coming from different subdomains, and which hence require a kind of
knowledge transfer.

technique is required to conduct the estimation, since there are false
correspondences or outliers. Current 3D keypoint techniques are much less
accurate than their 2D counterparts, thus they tend to produce extremely high
outlier rates. A large number of putative correspondences must thus be
extracted to ensure that sufficient good correspondences are available. Both
factors (high outlier rates, large data sizes) however cause existing robust
techniques to require very high computational cost. In this paper, we present a
novel preprocessing method called \emph{guaranteed outlier removal} for point
cloud registration. Our method reduces the input to a smaller set, in a way
that any rejected correspondence is guaranteed to not exist in the globally
optimal solution. The reduction is performed using purely geometric operations
which are deterministic and fast. Our method significantly reduces the
population of outliers, such that further optimization can be performed
quickly. Further, since only true outliers are removed, the globally optimal
solution is preserved. On various synthetic and real data experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our preprocessing method. Demo code is

minimizes the sum of slack variables. All the global minima of GPF with a zero

flow equations. By solving a relaxed version of GPF over a hypercube, if the
optimal value is strictly positive, there is no solution in this area and the
hypercube is discarded. Otherwise the hypercube is further divided into smaller

increased the cost of seismic acquisition. Simultaneous source acquisition
presents an opportunity to decrease costs by reducing the survey time. Source
time delays are typically long enough for seismic reflection energy to decay to
negligible levels before firing another source. Simultaneous source acquisition
abandons this minimum time restriction and allows interference between seismic
sources to compress the survey time. Seismic data processing methods must
address the interference introduced by simultaneous overlapping sources.
Simultaneous source data are characterized by high amplitude interference
artefacts that may be stronger than the primary signal. These large amplitudes
are due to the time delay between sources and the rapid decay of seismic energy
with arrival time. Therefore, source interference will appear as outliers in
denoising algorithms that make use of a Radon transform. This will reduce the
accuracy of Radon transform de-noising especially for weak signals. Formulating
the Radon transform as an inverse problem with an L1 misfit makes it robust to
outliers caused by source interference. This provides the ability to attenuate
strong source interference while preserving weak underlying signal. In order to
improve coherent signal focusing, an apex shifted hyperbolic Radon transform
(ASHRT) is used to remove source interferences. ASHRT transform basis functions
are tailored to match the travel time hyperbolas of reflections in common
receiver gathers. However, the ASHRT transform has a high computational cost
due to the extension of the model dimensions by scanning for apex locations. By
reformulating the ASHRT operator using a Stolt migration/demigration kernel
that exploits the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the computational efficiency of
the operator is drastically improved.

the network. The performance of the proposed detector improves by increasing
the number of antennas at the base station, the number of unused pilots and

data that demand extremely powerful computers for processing. This is a
limiting factor due to the large computational power and energy costs involved.
Such limitations restrict several key data processing steps in radio
interferometry. One such step is calibration where systematic errors in the
data are determined and corrected. Accurate calibration is an essential
component in reaching many scientific goals in radio astronomy and the use of
consensus optimization that exploits the continuity of systematic errors across
frequency significantly improves calibration accuracy. In order to reach full
consensus, data at all frequencies need to be calibrated simultaneously. In the
SKA regime, this can become intractable if the available compute agents do not
have the resources to process data from all frequency channels simultaneously.
In this paper, we propose a multiplexing scheme that is based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with cyclic updates. With
this scheme, it is possible to simultaneously calibrate the full dataset using
far fewer compute agents than the number of frequencies at which data are
available. We give simulation results to show the feasibility of the proposed
multiplexing scheme in simultaneously calibrating a full dataset when a limited
number of compute agents are available.

Vinod Reddy","On Structural Parameterizations of Firefighting","19 pages, To be appeared in CALDAM 2018",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Firefighting problem is defined as follows. At time $t=0$, a fire breaks
out at a vertex of a graph. At each time step $t \geq 0$, a firefighter
permanently defends (protects) an unburned vertex, and the fire then spread to
all undefended neighbors from the vertices on fire. This process stops when the
fire cannot spread anymore. The goal is to find a sequence of vertices for the
firefighter that maximizes the number of saved (non burned) vertices.
  The Firefighting problem turns out to be NP-hard even when restricted to
bipartite graphs or trees of maximum degree three. We study the parameterized
complexity of the Firefighting problem for various structural
parameterizations. All our parameters measure the distance to a graph class (in
terms of vertex deletion) on which the firefighting problem admits a polynomial
time algorithm. Specifically, for a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ and a graph $G$,
a vertex subset $S$ is called a modulator to $\mathcal{F}$ if $G \setminus S$
belongs to $\mathcal{F}$. The parameters we consider are the sizes of
modulators to graph classes such as threshold graphs, bounded diameter graphs,
disjoint unions of stars, and split graphs.
  To begin with, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by
the size of a modulator to diameter at most two graphs and split graphs. In
contrast to the above intractability results, we show that Firefighting is
fixed parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the size of a modulator
to threshold graphs and disjoint unions of stars, which are subclasses of
diameter at most two graphs. We further investigate the kernelization
complexity of these problems to find that firefighting admits a polynomial
kernel when parameterized by the size of a modulator to a clique, while it is
unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the size of a
modulator to a disjoint union of stars.

near- and far-ultraviolet spectra, we measured the line intensity, width, and
Doppler shift; followed traces of LBs in the chromosphere and transition region
(TR); and compared LB parameters with umbra and quiet Sun. There is a
systematic emission enhancement in LBs compared to nearby umbra from the
photosphere up to the TR. Light bridges are systematically displaced toward the
solar limb at higher layers: the amount of the displacement at one solar radius
compares well with the typical height of the chromosphere and TR. The intensity
of the LB sample compared to the umbra sample peaks at the middle/upper
chromosphere where they are almost permanently bright. Spectral lines emerging
from the LBs are broader than the nearby umbra. The systematic redshift of the
Si IV line in the LB sample is reduced compared to the quiet Sun sample. We
found a significant correlation between the line width of ions arising at
temperatures from 3x10^4 to 1.5x10^5 K as there is also a strong spatial
correlation among the line and continuum intensities. In addition, the
intensity-line width relation holds for all spectral lines in this study. The
correlations indicate that the cool and hot plasma in LBs are coupled. Light
bridges comprise multi-temperature and multi-disciplinary structures extending
up to the TR. Diverse heating sources supply the energy and momentum to
different layers, resulting in distinct dynamics in the photosphere,
chromosphere, and TR.

demonstration of quantum information protocols. Many relevant protocols,
however, involve an infinite set of input states, of which only a finite subset
can be used to test the quality of the implementation. This is a problem,
because the benchmark for the finitely many states used in the test can be
higher than the original benchmark calculated for infinitely many states. This
situation arises in the teleportation and storage of coherent states, for which
the benchmark of 50% fidelity is commonly used in experiments, although finite
sets of coherent states normally lead to higher benchmarks. Here we show that
the average fidelity over all coherent states can be indirectly probed with a
single setup, requiring only two-mode squeezing, a 50-50 beamsplitter, and
homodyne detection. Our setup enables a rigorous experimental validation of
quantum teleportation, storage, amplification, attenuation, and purification of
noisy coherent states. More generally, we prove that every quantum benchmark
can be tested by preparing a single entangled state and measuring a single
observable.

are partitioned into subsets called types and blocks; we seek a matching with
the largest sum of weights under the constraint that there is a pre-specified
cap on the number of vertices matched in every type-block pair. Our primary
motivation stems from the public housing program of Singapore, accounting for
over 70% of its residential real estate. To promote ethnic diversity within its
housing projects, Singapore imposes ethnicity quotas: each new housing
development comprises blocks of flats and each ethnicity-based group in the
population must not own more than a certain percentage of flats in a block.
Other domains using similar hard capacity constraints include matching
prospective students to schools or medical residents to hospitals. Limiting
agents' choices for ensuring diversity in this manner naturally entails some
welfare loss. One of our goals is to study the trade-off between diversity and
social welfare in such settings. We first show that, while the classic
assignment program is polynomial-time computable, adding diversity constraints
makes it computationally intractable; however, we identify a
$\tfrac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm, as well as reasonable assumptions on
the weights that permit poly-time algorithms. Next, we provide two upper bounds
on the price of diversity -- a measure of the loss in welfare incurred by
imposing diversity constraints -- as functions of natural problem parameters.
We conclude the paper with simulations based on publicly available data from
two diversity-constrained allocation problems -- Singapore Public Housing and
Chicago School Choice -- which shed light on how the constrained maximization

Ori-type variability: irregular, high amplitude optical and near-infrared
photometric fluctuations where flux minima coincide with polarization maxima.
This is attributed to changes in local opacity. In CO Ori A, these variations
exhibit a 12.4 yr cycle. Here, we investigate the physical origin of the
fluctuating opacity and its periodicity using interferometric observations of
CO Ori obtained using VLTI/GRAVITY. Continuum K-band circum-primary and
circum-secondary emission are marginally spatially resolved for the first time
while Br$\gamma$ emission is detected in the spectrum of the secondary. We
estimate a spectral type range for CO Ori B of K2-K5 assuming visual
extinction, $A_{\rm{V}}=2$ and a distance of 430 pc. From geometric modelling
of the continuum visibilities, the circum-primary emission is consistent with a
central point source plus a Gaussian component with a full-width-half-maximum
of 2.31$\pm$0.04 milliarcseconds (mas), inclined at 30.2$\pm$2.2$^{\circ}$ and
with a major axis position angle of 40$\pm$6$^{\circ}$. This inclination is
lower than that reported for the discs of other UX Ori-type stars, providing a
first indication that the UX Ori phenomena may arise through fluctuations in
circumstellar material exterior to a disc, e.g. in a dusty outflow. An
additional wide, symmetric Gaussian component is required to fit the
visibilities of CO Ori B, signifying a contribution from scattered light.
Finally, closure phases of CO Ori A were used to investigate whether the 12.4
yr periodicity is associated with an undetected third component, as has been
previously suggested. We rule out any additional companions contributing more
than 3.6% to the K-band flux within ~7.3-20 mas of CO Ori A.

recurrent eruptions in emerging flux regions. We find that reconnection of
sheared fieldlines, along the polarity inversion line of an emerging bipolar
region, leads to the formation of a new magnetic structure, which adopts the
shape of a magnetic flux rope during its rising motion. Initially, the flux
rope undergoes a slow-rise phase and, eventually, it experiences a fast-rise
phase and ejective eruption towards the outer solar atmosphere. In total, four
eruptions occur during the evolution of the system. For the first eruption, our
analysis indicates that the torus instability initiates the eruption and that
tether-cutting reconnection of the fieldlines, which envelope the flux rope,
triggers the rapid acceleration of the eruptive field. For the following
eruptions, we conjecture that it is the interplay between tether-cutting
reconnection and torus instability, which causes the onset of the various
phases. We show the 3D shape of the erupting fields, focusing more on how
magnetic fieldlines reconnect during the eruptions. We find that when the
envelope fieldlines reconnect mainly with themselves, hot and dense plasma is
transferred closer to the core of the erupting flux rope. The same area appears
to be cooler and less dense when the envelope fieldlines reconnect with
neighboring sheared fieldlines. The plasma density and temperature
distribution, together with the rising speeds, the energies and the size of the
erupting fields indicate that they may account for small-scale (mini) Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs).

interactions between single foreign adatoms and bismuthene structures, which
comprise stability, bonding, electronic and magnetic structures. Localized
states in diverse location of the band gap and resonant states in band continua
of bismuthene are induced upon the adsorption of different adatoms, which
modify electronic and magnetic properties. Specific adatoms result in
reconstruction around the adsorption site. Single and divacancies can form
readily in bismuthene structures and remain stable at high temperatures.
Through rebondings Stone-Whales type defects are constructed by divacancies,
which transform into a large hole at high temperature. Like adsorbed adatoms,
vacancies induce also localized gap states, which can be eliminated through
rebondings in divacancies. We also showed that not only optical and magnetic
properties, but also topological features of pristine h-bismuthene can be
modified by point defects. Modification of topological features depends on the
energies of localized states and also on the strength of coupling between point
defects.

these assumptions cannot be tested using the observed data, a mediation
analysis should always be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the
resulting estimates. In this article we propose a sensitivity analysis method
for parametric estimation of direct and indirect effects when the exposure,
mediator and outcome are all binary. The sensitivity parameters consist of the
correlation between the error terms of the mediator and outcome models, the
correlation between the error terms of the mediator model and the model for the
exposure assignment mechanism, and the correlation between the error terms of
the exposure assignment and outcome models. These correlations are incorporated
into the estimation of the model parameters and identification sets are then
obtained for the direct and indirect effects for a range of plausible
correlation values. We take the sampling variability into account through the
construction of uncertainty intervals. The proposed method is able to assess
sensitivity to both mediator-outcome confounding and confounding involving the
exposure. To illustrate the method we apply it to a mediation study based on
data from the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke).

quantum theory with gravity for the case of the maximally symmetric space. This
relation establishes a connection between fluctuations of the quantities which
determine the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of the spacelike hypersurface
in spacetime and introduces the uncertainty principle for quantum gravitational
systems. The generalized time-energy uncertainty relation, which takes into
account gravity, is proposed. It is shown that known Unruh's uncertainty
relation follows, as a particular case, from the new uncertainty relation. As
an example, the sizes of fluctuations of the scale factor and its conjugate
momentum are calculated within an exactly solvable model. All known
modifications of the uncertainty principle deduced previously from different
approaches in the theory of gravity and string theory are obtained as
particular cases of the proposed general expression.

call reinforcement mechanism design to tackle the dynamic pricing problem in
sponsored search auctions. In contrast to previous game-theoretical approaches
that heavily rely on rationality and common knowledge among the bidders, we
take a data-driven approach, and try to learn, over repeated interactions, the
set of optimal reserve prices. We implement our approach within the current
sponsored search framework of a major search engine: we first train a buyer
behavior model, via a real bidding data set, that accurately predicts bids
given information that bidders are aware of, including the game parameters
disclosed by the search engine, as well as the bidders' KPI data from previous
rounds. We then put forward a reinforcement/MDP (Markov Decision Process) based
algorithm that optimizes reserve prices over time, in a GSP-like auction. Our
simulations demonstrate that our framework outperforms static optimization
strategies including the ones that are currently in use, as well as several
other dynamic ones.

overwhelmingly employed He-3-based technologies. The He-3 crisis together with
the forthcoming establishment of the European Spallation Source have
necessitated the development of new technologies for neutron detection. Today,
several promising He-3-free candidates are under detailed study and need to be
validated. This validation process is in general long and expensive. The study
of detector prototypes using neutron-emitting radioactive sources is a
cost-effective solution, especially for preliminary investigations. That said,
neutron-emitting sources have the general disadvantage of broad, structured,
emitted-neutron energy ranges. Further, the emitted neutrons often compete with
unwanted backgrounds of gamma-rays, alpha-particles, and fission-fragments. By
blending experimental infrastructure such as shielding to provide particle
beams with neutron-detection techniques such as tagging, disadvantages may be
converted into advantages. In particular, a technique known as tagging involves
exploiting the mixed-field generally associated with a neutron-emitting source
to determine neutron time-of-flight and thus energy on an event-by-event basis.
This allows for the definition of low-cost, precision neutron beams. The
Source-Testing Facility, located at Lund University in Sweden and operated by
the SONNIG Group of the Division of Nuclear Physics, was developed for just
such low-cost studies. Precision tagged-neutron beams derived from radioactive
sources are available around-the-clock for advanced detector diagnostic
studies. Neutron measurements performed at the Source Testing Facility are thus
cost-effective and have a very low barrier for entry. In this paper, we present
an overview of the project.

remain powerful methods for action recognition. DL has brought the use of large
datasets and this is typically a problem for kernel approaches, which are not
scaling up efficiently due to kernel Gram matrices. Nevertheless, kernel
methods are still attractive and more generally applicable since they can
equally manage different sizes of the datasets, also in cases where DL
techniques show some limitations. This work investigates these issues by
proposing an explicit approximated representation that, together with a linear
model, is an equivalent, yet scalable, implementation of a kernel machine. Our
approximation is directly inspired by the exact feature map that is induced by
an RBF Gaussian kernel but, unlike the latter, it is finite dimensional and
very compact. We justify the soundness of our idea with a theoretical analysis
which proves the unbiasedness of the approximation, and provides a vanishing
bound for its variance, which is shown to decrease much rapidly than in
alternative methods in the literature. In a broad experimental validation, we
assess the superiority of our approximation in terms of 1) ease and speed of
training, 2) compactness of the model, and 3) improvements with respect to the

a nano-scale analysis of residual lattice strains and defects formed. Our
results show that 30 keV glancing incidence milling produces fewer large
defects than normal incidence milling at the same energy. However the resulting
residual lattice strains have similar magnitude and extend up to ~50 nm into
the sample. At the edges of the milled surface, where the ion-beam tails impact
the sample at near-normal incidence, large dislocation loops with a range of
burgers vectors are formed. Further glancing incidence FIB polishing with 5 keV
ion energy removes these dislocation loops and reduces the lattice strains
caused by higher energy FIB milling. However, even at the lower ion energy,
damage-induced lattice strains are present within a ~20 nm thick surface layer.

FIB damage. They also show that low-energy FIB-milling is an effective tool for

energy range of $1 - 3.5A$ GeV for elementary, proton-nucleus and
nucleus-nucleus reactions. The present approach employing a resonance treatment
based on vacuum properties is validated by an excellent agreement with
experimental data up to system sizes of carbon-carbon collisions. After
establishing this well-understood baseline in elementary and small systems, the
significance of medium effects is investigated with a coarse-graining approach
based on the same hadronic evolution. The effect of explicit in-medium
modifications to the vector meson spectral functions is important for dilepton
invariant mass spectra in ArKCl and larger systems, even though the transport
approach with vacuum properties reveals similar features due the coupling to
baryonic resonance and the intrinsically included collisional broadening. This
article provides a comprehensive comparison of our calculations with published
dielectron results from the HADES collaboration. In addition, the emission of
dileptons is predicted in gold-gold and pion-beam experiments for which results
are expected soon.

studies have shown that performing 3D convolutions is a rewarding approach to
capture both spatial and temporal dimensions in videos. However, the
development of a very deep 3D CNN from scratch results in expensive
computational cost and memory demand. A valid question is why not recycle
off-the-shelf 2D networks for a 3D CNN. In this paper, we devise multiple
variants of bottleneck building blocks in a residual learning framework by
simulating $3\times3\times3$ convolutions with $1\times3\times3$ convolutional
filters on spatial domain (equivalent to 2D CNN) plus $3\times1\times1$
convolutions to construct temporal connections on adjacent feature maps in

median-of-means (MOM) estimators of the mean of real valued random variables.
These estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence under minimal assumptions
on the dataset. The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on which
no assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard
tools from robust statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of
breakdown point. We modify the original definition by studying the number of
outliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation
properties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that
takes into account the statistical performances of the estimators, is
non-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine learning purposes. We proved
that the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of (number of
observations)*(rate of convergence). For instance, the breakdown number of our
estimators for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise
variance sigma^2 is sigma^2d and it becomes sigma^2 s log(d/s) when this vector
has only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown point, we proved that the
rate of convergence achieved by our estimator is (number of outliers) divided
by (number of observation).
  Besides these theoretical guarantees, the major improvement brought by these
new estimators is that they are easily computable in practice. In fact,
basically any algorithm used to approximate the standard Empirical Risk
Minimizer (or its regularized versions) has a robust version approximating our
estimators. As a proof of concept, we study many algorithms for the classical
LASSO estimator. A byproduct of the MOM algorithms is a measure of depth of
data that can be used to detect outliers.

in order to permit wave energy compression, redirection, imaging, sound
absorption and other special functionalities. Generally however such slow sound
structures have a poor impedance match to air, particularly at low frequencies,
and consequently exhibit strong transmission only in narrow frequency ranges.
This therefore strongly restricts their application in wave manipulation
devices. In this work we design a slow sound medium that halves the effective
speed of sound in air over a wide range of low frequencies, whilst
simultaneously maintaining a near impedance match to air. This is achieved with
a rectangular array of cylinders of elliptical cross section, a microstructure
that is motivated by combining transformation acoustics with homogenization.
Microstructural parameters are optimised in order to provide the required
anisotropic material properties as well as near impedance matching. We then
employ this microstructure in order to halve the size of a quarter-wavelength
resonator (QWR), or equivalently to halve the resonant frequency of a QWR of a
given size. This provides significant space savings in the context of
low-frequency tonal noise attenuation in confined environments where the
absorbing material is adjacent to the region in which sound propagates, such as
in a duct. We term the elliptical microstructure `universal' since it may be
employed in a number of diverse applications.

state-of-the-art in several natural language processing tasks and was

paper, we propose a novel content-based recommender system based on learned

follows: First, we learn representations on a corpus of text documents. Then,
we capture a user's interest as a generative model in the space of the document
representations. In particular, we model the distribution of interest for each
user as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Recommendations can be obtained
directly by sampling from a user's generative model. Using Latent semantic

on the Delicious bookmarks dataset, a standard benchmark for recommender
systems. We then perform density estimation in both spaces and show that
learned representations outperform LSA in terms of predictive performance.

  Missions with Long-Endurance Solar-Powered Aircraft",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solar-powered aircraft promise significantly increased flight endurance over
conventional aircraft. While this makes them promising candidates for
large-scale aerial inspection missions, their structural fragility necessitates
that adverse weather is avoided using appropriate path planning methods. This
paper therefore presents MetPASS, the Meteorology-aware Path Planning and
Analysis Software for Solar-powered UAVs. MetPASS is the first path planning
framework in the literature that considers all aspects that influence the
safety or performance of solar-powered flight: It avoids environmental risks
(thunderstorms, rain, wind, wind gusts and humidity) and exploits advantageous
regions (high sun radiation or tailwind). It also avoids system risks such as
low battery state of charge and returns safe paths through cluttered terrain.
MetPASS imports weather data from global meteorological models, propagates the
aircraft state through an energetic system model, and then combines both into a
cost function. A combination of dynamic programming techniques and an
A*-search-algorithm with a custom heuristic is leveraged to plan globally
optimal paths in station-keeping, point-to-point or multi-goal aerial
inspection missions with coverage guarantees. A full software implementation
including a GUI is provided. The planning methods are verified using three
missions of ETH Zurich's AtlantikSolar UAV: An 81-hour continuous solar-powered
station-keeping flight, a 4000km Atlantic crossing from Newfoundland to
Portugal, and two multi-glacier aerial inspection missions above the Arctic
Ocean performed near Greenland in summer 2017.

recently been derived, based on only the action principle and on the Principle
of General Relativity. It was thus shown that Einstein's General Relativity is
the special case where (i) the Hilbert Lagrangian (essentially the Ricci
scalar) is supposed to describe the dynamics of the ""free"" (uncoupled)
gravitational field, and (ii) the energy-momentum tensor is that of scalar
fields representing real or complex structureless (spin-$0$) particles. It
followed that all other source fields---such as vector fields representing
massive and non-massive spin-$1$ particles---need careful scrutiny of the
appropriate source tensor. This is the subject of our actual paper: we discuss
in detail the coupling of the gravitational field with (i) a massive complex
scalar field, (ii) a massive real vector field, and (iii) a massless vector
field. We show that different couplings emerge for massive and non-massive
vector fields. The \emph{massive} vector field has the \emph{canonical}
energy-momentum tensor as the appropriate source term---which embraces also the
energy density furnished by the internal spin. In this case, the vector fields
are shown to generate a torsion of spacetime. In contrast, the system of a
\emph{massless} and charged vector field is associated with the \emph{metric}
(Hilbert) energy-momentum tensor due to its additional $\mathrm{U}(1)$
symmetry. Moreover, such vector fields do not generate a torsion of spacetime.
The respective sources of gravitation apply for all models of the dynamics of
the `free' (uncoupled) gravitational field---which do not follow from the gauge
formalism but must be specified based on separate physical reasoning.

oxygen diffusion and oxygen catalysis in technologies like solid oxide fuel
cells. Both previous literature in various systems and our calculations in
LaMnO3, La0.75Sr0.25MnO3, LaFeO3, and La0.75Sr0.25FeO3, show mixed results for
the direction and magnitude of the change in vacancy formation energy with
strain. This paper develops a model to make sense of the different trend shapes
in vacancy formation energy versus strain. We model strain effects using a set
of consistent ab initio calculations, and demonstrate that our calculated
results may be simply explained in terms of vacancy formation volume and
changes in elastic constants between the bulk and defected states. A positive
vacancy formation volume contributes to decreased vacancy formation energy
under tensile strain, and an increase in elastic constants contributes to
increases in vacancy formation energy with compressive and tensile strains, and
vice versa. The vacancy formation volume dominates the linear portion of the
vacancy formation energy strain response, while its curvature is governed by
the vacancy-induced change in elastic constants. We show results sensitive to
B-site cation, A-site doping, tilt system, and vacancy placement, which
contributions may be averaged under thermally averaged conditions. In general,
vacancy formation energies for most systems calculated here decreased with
tensile strain, with about a 30-100 meV/% strain decrease with biaxial strain
for those systems which showed a decrease in vacancy formation energy.
Experimental verification is necessary to confirm the model outside of
calculation.

formation/decomposition of metal oxides on cycling. Irreversible parasitic
reactions cause poor rechargeability, efficiency, and cycle life and have
predominantly been ascribed to the reactivity of reduced oxygen species with
cell components. These species, however, cannot fully explain the side
reactions. Here we show that singlet oxygen forms at the cathode of a
lithium-oxygen cell during discharge and from the onset of charge, and accounts
for the majority of parasitic reaction products. The amount increases during
discharge, early stages of charge, and charging at higher voltages, and is
enhanced by the presence of trace water. Superoxide and peroxide appear to be
involved in singlet oxygen generation. Singlet oxygen traps and quenchers can
reduce parasitic reactions effectively. Awareness of the highly reactive
singlet oxygen in non-aqueous metal-oxygen batteries gives a rationale for
future research towards achieving highly reversible cell operation.

settings and thus saves valuable computational resources during the tuning
process of deep learning models. Specifically, we use a dataset collected from
a Wi-Fi campus network to train deep learning models to predict the number of
occupants and their locations. Our preliminary experiments indicate that PSO
provides an efficient approach for tuning the optimal number of hidden layers
and the number of neurons in each layer of the deep learning algorithm when
compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the
exploration process of the landscape of configurations to find the optimal
parameters is decreased by 77%-85%. In fact, the PSO yields even better
accuracy results.

key component of smart building services. Commercial, industrial and
residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy.
However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the
effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we propose to replace
sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of
occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi data sets readily
available in abundance for smart building services and train Auto Regression
Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
time series models. As a use case scenario of smart building services, these
models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location
in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point
(AP) level. For LSTM, we build our models in two ways: a separate model for
every time scale, and a combined model for the three time scales. Our
experiments show that LSTM combined model reduced the computational resources
with respect to the number of neurons by 74.48 % for the AP level, and by 67.13
% for the building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was
reduced by 88.2% - 93.4% for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA for the building
levels models and by 80.9% - 87% for the AP level models.

underlying Markov process. Based on a priori information of the temporal
dependence of the uncontrollable parameters and the spatial dependence between

obtain a sequence of transition matrices of the controllable parameters

ingredient for quantum technologies. Single atoms and atom-like defects in
solids are ideal quantum light sources and quantum memories to store
entanglement. However, a major obstacle to developing long-range quantum
networks is the mismatch between typical atomic transition energies in the
ultraviolet and visible spectrum, and the low-loss propagation band of optical
fibers in the infrared, around 1.5 $\mu$m. A notable exception is the Er$^{3+}$
ion, whose 1.5 $\mu$m transition is exploited in fiber amplifiers that drive
modern communications networks. However, an optical interface to single
Er$^{3+}$ ions has not yet been achieved because of the low photon emission
rate, less than 100 Hz, that results from the electric dipole-forbidden nature
of this transition. Here, we demonstrate that the emission rate of single
Er$^{3+}$ ions in a solid-state host can be enhanced by a factor of more than
300 using a small mode-volume, low-loss silicon nanophotonic cavity. This
enhancement enables the fluorescence from single Er$^{3+}$ ions to be clearly
observed for the first time. Tuning the excitation laser over a small frequency
range allows dozens of distinct ions to be addressed, and the splitting of the
lines in a magnetic field confirms that the optical transitions are coupled to
the Er$^{3+}$ ions' spins. These results are a significant step towards
long-distance quantum networks and deterministic quantum logic for photons,
based on a scalable silicon nanophotonics architecture.

crystallographic planes the phenomenon of planar channeling is possible, in
which the particles move in channels formed by the continuous potential of
crystalline planes. Such particle motion in a crystal is conserved for most
particles even for weak bending of crystalline planes of atoms. In [1-3] the
process of channeled electrons radiation in such a device was considered. It
was shown that the radiation spectrum of particles in the crystal in this case
contains maxima associated with the period of oscillation of the channeled
particles in the channel and with the period of the crystal planes bending. In
[4] the radiation process in a crystalline undulator with large bending
amplitude of the crystal planes was considered. In this case the trajectories
of particles that are crossing the crystal planes are close to rectilinear.
This allowed consider the radiation process in the first approximation in the
interaction of particles with the crystal field analytically. In that paper the
possibility of manifesting coherent and interference effects in radiation
leading to high radiation intensity was demonstrated. Taking into account the
incoherent effects in the particle scattering leads to particle mutual
transitions from the sub-barrier to the above-barrier states and vice versa.
Analysis of the radiation process in this case can be carried out on the basis
of numerical simulation method for this process. In this paper such method is

entrywise addition and contraction of higher-order tensors. We present, TLib,
flexible tensor framework with generic tensor functions and tensor classes that
assists users to implement generic and flexible tensor algorithms in C++. The
number of dimensions, the extents of the dimensions of the tensors and the
contraction modes of the tensor operations can be runtime variable. Our
framework provides tensor classes that simplify the management of
multidimensional data and utilization of tensor operations using
object-oriented and generic programming techniques. Additional stream classes
help the user to verify and compare of numerical results with MATLAB. Tensor
operations are implemented with generic tensor functions and in terms of
multidimensional iterator types only, decoupling data storage representation
and computation. The user can combine tensor functions with different tensor
types and extend the framework without further modification of the classes or
functions. We discuss the design and implementation of the framework and
demonstrate its usage with examples that have been discussed in the literature.

range of 7.2-19 keV. High diffraction efficiency of 62.6% together with an

  tissue engineering",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tissue engineering aims to grow artificial tissues \emph{in vitro} to replace
those in the body that have been damaged through age, trauma or disease. A
recent approach to engineer artificial cartilage involves seeding cells within
a scaffold consisting of an interconnected 3D-printed lattice of polymer fibres
combined with a cast or printed hydrogel, and subjecting the construct
(cell-seeded scaffold) to an applied load in a bioreactor. A key question is to
understand how the applied load is distributed throughout the construct. To
address this, we employ homogenisation theory to derive equations governing the
effective macroscale material properties of a periodic, elastic-poroelastic
composite. We treat the fibres as a linear elastic material and the hydrogel as
a poroelastic material, and exploit the disparate length scales (small
inter-fibre spacing compared with construct dimensions) to derive macroscale
equations governing the response of the composite to an applied load. This
homogenised description reflects the orthotropic nature of the composite. To
validate the model, solutions from finite element simulations of the
macroscale, homogenised equations are compared to experimental data describing
the unconfined compression of the fibre-reinforced hydrogels. The model is used
to derive the bulk mechanical properties of a cylindrical construct of the
composite material for a range of fibre spacings, and to determine the local
mechanical environment experienced by cells embedded within the construct.

  of tactile and auditory signals",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tactile speech aids, though extensively studied in the 1980s and 90s, never
became a commercial success. A hypothesis to explain this failure might be that
it is difficult to obtain true perceptual integration of a tactile signal with
information from auditory speech: exploitation of tactile cues from a tactile
aid might require cognitive effort and so prevent speech understanding at the
high rates typical of everyday speech. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to
create true perceptual integration of tactile with auditory information in what
might be considered the simplest situation encountered by a hearing-impaired
listener. We created an auditory continuum between the syllables BA and VA, and
trained participants to associate BA to one tactile stimulus VA to another
tactile stimulus. After training, we tested if auditory discrimination along
the continuum between the two syllables could be biased by incongruent tactile
stimulation. We found that such a bias occurred only when the tactile stimulus
was above its previously measured tactile discrimination threshold. Such a
pattern is compatible with the idea that the effect is due to a cognitive or
decisional strategy, rather than to truly perceptual integration. We therefore
ran a further study, where we created a tactile version of the McGurk effect.
We extensively trained two Subjects over six days to associate four recorded
auditory syllables with four corresponding apparent motion tactile patterns. In
a subsequent test, we presented stimulation that was either congruent or
incongruent with the learnt association, and asked Subjects to report the
syllable they perceived. We found no analog to the McGurk effect. These
findings strengthen our hypothesis according to which tactile aids failed
because integration of tactile cues with auditory speech occurred at a
cognitive or decisional level, rather than truly at a perceptual level
