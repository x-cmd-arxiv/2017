scales, while retaining attractive gravity at local scales. Mannheim (2003)
finds that CG agrees with $\Lambda$CDM for supernova data at redshifts $z<1$.
We use GRBs and quasars as standard candles to contrast these models in the
redshift range $0<z<8$. We find CG deviates significantly from $\Lambda$CDM at
high redshift and that $\Lambda$CDM is favoured by the data with
$\Delta\chi^2=48$. Mannheim's model has a bounded dark energy contribution, but
we identify a $\lambda$ fine-tuning problem and a cosmic coincidence problem.

as a major contributor to the energy consumption of compute-intensive
applications with large dynamic range. Experimental evidence shows that 50% of
the energy consumed by a core and its data memory is related to FP
computations. The adoption of FP formats requiring a lower number of bits is an
interesting opportunity to reduce energy consumption, since it allows to
simplify the arithmetic circuitry and to reduce the memory bandwidth between
memory and registers by enabling vectorization. From a theoretical point of
view, the adoption of multiple FP types perfectly fits with the principle of
transprecision computing, allowing fine-grained control of approximation while
meeting specified constraints on the precision of final results. In this paper
we propose an extended FP type system with complete hardware support to enable
transprecision computing on low-power embedded processors, including two
standard formats (binary32 and binary16) and two new formats (binary8 and
binary16alt). First, we introduce a software library that enables exploration
of FP types by tuning both precision and dynamic range of program variables.
Then, we present a methodology to integrate our library with an external tool
for precision tuning, and experimental results that highlight the clear
benefits of introducing the new formats. Finally, we present the design of a
transprecision FP unit capable of handling 8-bit and 16-bit operations in
addition to standard 32-bit operations. Experimental results on FP-intensive
benchmarks show that up to 90% of FP operations can be safely scaled down to
8-bit or 16-bit formats. Thanks to precision tuning and vectorization,
execution time is decreased by 12% and memory accesses are reduced by 27% on

state-of-the-art re-ranking methods our approach does not require to compute
new rank lists for each image pair (e.g., based on reciprocal neighbors) and
performs well by using simple direct rank list based comparison or even by just
using the already computed euclidean distances between the images. We show that

scenario, when the viewing angle is less than 180$^\circ$, which can occur due
to different factors including restrictions on scanning time, limited
flexibility of scanner rotation, etc. The sinograms obtained as a result, cause
existing techniques to produce highly artifact-laden reconstructions. In this
paper, we propose to address this problem through implicit sinogram completion,
on a challenging real world dataset containing scans of common checked-in
luggage. We propose a system, consisting of 1D and 2D convolutional neural
networks, that operates on a limited angle sinogram to directly produce the
best estimate of a reconstruction. Next, we use the x-ray transform on this

reconstruction techniques to obtain the final reconstruction. We show with
extensive experimentation that this combined strategy outperforms many
competitive baselines. We also propose a measure of confidence for the
reconstruction that enables a practitioner to gauge the reliability of a
prediction made by our network. We show that this measure is a strong indicator
of quality as measured by the PSNR, while not requiring ground truth at test
time. Finally, using a segmentation experiment, we show that our reconstruction

provide to the model the raw pixel information, achieving the same 0.97 of

Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object detection in

well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes. To advance object
detection research in Earth Vision, also known as Earth Observation and Remote

images (DOTA). To this end, we collect $2806$ aerial images from different
sensors and platforms. Each image is of the size about 4000-by-4000 pixels and
contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes.
These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation
using $15$ common object categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains
$188,282$ instances, each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.)

evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA. Experiments
demonstrate that DOTA well represents real Earth Vision applications and are

activities and personal profiles, have been an enormous success in the last
several years. Most of the existing works are based on the similarities of
users, objects or both that derived from their purchases records in the online
shopping platforms. Such approaches, however, are facing bottlenecks when the
known information is limited. The extreme case is how to recommend products to
new users, namely the so-called cold-start problem. The rise of the online
social networks gives us a chance to break the glass ceiling. Birds of a
feather flock together. Close friends may have similar hidden pattern of
selecting products and the advices from friends are more trustworthy.
  In this paper, we integrate the individual's social relationships into
recommender systems and propose a new method, called Social Mass Diffusion
(SMD), based on a mass diffusion process in the combined network of users'
social network and user-item bipartite network. The results show that the SMD
algorithm can achieve higher recommendation accuracy than the Mass Diffusion
(MD) purely on the bipartite network. Especially, the improvement is striking
for small degree users. Moreover, SMD provides a good solution to the
cold-start problem. The recommendation accuracy for new users significantly
higher than that of the conventional popularity-based algorithm. These results
may shed some light on the new designs of better personalized recommender

target regions to accelerators such as NVIDIA GPUs. The implementation in
Clang/LLVM aims to deliver a generic GPU compilation toolchain that supports
both the native CUDA C/C++ and the OpenMP device offloading models. There are
situations where the semantics of OpenMP and those of CUDA diverge. One such
example is the policy for implicitly handling local variables. In CUDA, local
variables are implicitly mapped to thread local memory and thus become private
to a CUDA thread. In OpenMP, due to semantics that allow the nesting of regions
executed by different numbers of threads, variables need to be implicitly
\emph{shared} among the threads of a contention group. In this paper we
introduce a re-design of the OpenMP device data sharing infrastructure that is
responsible for the implicit sharing of local variables in the Clang/LLVM
toolchain. We introduce a new data sharing infrastructure that lowers
implicitly shared variables to the shared memory of the GPU. We measure the
amount of shared memory used by our scheme in cases that involve scalar
variables and statically allocated arrays. The evaluation is carried out by
offloading to K40 and P100 NVIDIA GPUs. For scalar variables the pressure on
shared memory is relatively low, under 26\% of shared memory utilization for
the K40, and does not negatively impact occupancy. The limiting occupancy
factor in that case is register pressure. The data sharing scheme offers the
users a simple memory model for controlling the implicit allocation of device
shared memory.

e.g., the generation of highly indistinguishable photons, few-photon optical

charge and nuclear spin noise is of importance and the influence of photonic

scattering of single photons from the quantum dot can be obtained with an
extinction of $66 \pm 4 \%$, which is limited by the coupling of the quantum
dot to the nanostructure rather than the linewidth broadening. This is obtained
by embedding the quantum dot in an electrically-contacted nanophotonic
membrane. A clear pathway to obtaining even larger single-photon extinction is
laid out, i.e., the approach enables a fully deterministic and coherent
photon-emitter interface in the solid state that is operated at optical

systems, where certain lines are fixed (uncontrollable) and the remaining ones
are controllable via on/off switches. The goal is to identify a topology of the
power grid that minimizes the cost of the system operation while satisfying the
physical and operational constraints. Most of the existing methods for the
problem are based on first converting the OTS into a mixed-integer linear
program (MILP) or mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), and then iteratively
solving a series of its convex relaxations. The performance of these methods
depends heavily on the strength of the MILP or MIQP formulations. In this
paper, it is shown that finding the strongest variable upper and lower bounds
to be used in an MILP or MIQP formulation of the OTS based on the big-$M$ or
McCormick inequalities is NP-hard. Furthermore, it is proven that unless P=NP,
there is no constant-factor approximation algorithm for constructing these
variable bounds. Despite the inherent difficulty of obtaining the strongest
bounds in general, a simple bound strengthening method is presented to
strengthen the convex relaxation of the problem when there exists a connected
spanning subnetwork of the system with fixed lines. The proposed method can be
treated as a preprocessing step that is independent of the solver to be later
used for numerical calculations and can be carried out offline before
initiating the solver. A remarkable speedup in the runtime of the mixed-integer
solvers is obtained using the proposed bound strengthening method for medium-
and large-scale real-world systems.

processing and edge caching for content delivery to the users. To this end,
F-RAN utilizes caches at the edge nodes (ENs) and fronthaul links connecting a
cloud processor to ENs. Assuming time-invariant content popularity, existing
information-theoretic analyses of content delivery in F-RANs rely on offline
caching with separate content placement and delivery phases. In contrast, this
work focuses on the scenario in which the set of popular content is
time-varying, hence necessitating the online replenishment of the ENs' caches
along with the delivery of the requested files. The analysis is centered on the
characterization of the long-term Normalized Delivery Time (NDT), which
captures the temporal dependence of the coding latencies accrued across
multiple time slots in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Online edge
caching and delivery schemes are investigated for both serial and pipelined
transmission modes across fronthaul and edge segments. Analytical results
demonstrate that, in the presence of a time-varying content popularity, the
rate of fronthaul links sets a fundamental limit to the long-term NDT of F- RAN

yielding important design insights.

motivated by the example of a quantum dot with strong repulsive or attractive
electron-electron interaction. Using the geometric formulation of adiabatic
nonunitary evolution put forward by Sarandy and Lidar, we derive an
encompassing approach to ideal charge measurements of time-dependently driven
transport, that stays near the familiar approach to closed systems. Following
Schaller, Kie{\ss}lich and Brandes we explicitly account for a meter that
registers the transported charge outside the system. The gauge freedom
underlying geometric pumping effects in all moments of the transported charge
emerges naturally as the calibration of this meter. Remarkably, we find that
geometric and physical considerations cannot be applied independently as done
in closed systems: physical recalibrations do not form a group due to
constraints of positivity (Bochner's theorem). This complication goes unnoticed
when considering only the average charge but it is relevant for understanding
the origin of geometric effects in the higher moments of the charge-transport
statistics. As an application we derive two prominent existing approaches to
pumping, based on full-counting-statistics (FCS) and adiabatic-response (AR),
respectively, from our approach in a transparent way. This allows us to
reconcile all their apparent incompatibilities, in particular the puzzle how
for the average charge the nonadiabatic stationary-state AR result can exactly
agree with the adiabatic nonstationary FCS result. We relate this and other
difficulties to a single characteristic of geometric approaches to open
systems: the system-environment boundary can always be chosen to either include
or exclude the ideal charge meter. This leads to a physically motivated
relation between the mixed-state Berry phase and the entirely different
geometric phase of Landsberg.

i.e. not induced by the standard mass mechanism of light neutrino exchange,
would correspond to an efficient washout of lepton number above the electroweak

sphaleron transitions, this would render many baryogenesis mechanisms at higher

with the binary variable as the outcome. Extending results in Christensen
(1997), by also considering the case where factors present in the contingency
table disappear from the logistic regression model, we prove that the Maximum
Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the parameters of the logistic regression equals
the MLE for the corresponding parameters of the log-linear model. We prove
that, asymptotically, standard errors for the two sets of parameters are also
equal. Subsequently, Wald confidence intervals are asymptotically equal. These
results demonstrate the extent to which inferences from the log-linear
framework can be translated to inferences within the logistic regression
framework, on the magnitude of main effects and interactions. Finally, we prove
that the deviance of the log-linear model is equal to the deviance of the
corresponding logistic regression, provided that the latter is fitted to a

infections in complex networks. Many works have been devoted to analytically
understand how to restructure the network to minimize the impact of major
outbreaks of infections at large scale. In many cases, the strategies consist
in the isolation of certain nodes, while less attention has been paid to the
intervention on links. In epidemic spreading, links inform about the
probability of carrying the contagion of the disease from infected to
susceptible individuals. Note that these states depend on the full structure of
the network, and its determination is not straightforward from the knowledge of
nodes' states. Here, we confront this challenge and propose a set of
discrete-time governing equations \rev{which} can be closed and analyzed,
assessing the contribution of links to spreading processes in complex networks.
Our approach allows a scheme for the \rev{containment} of epidemics, based on
deactivating the most important links in transmitting the disease. The model is
validated in synthetic and real networks, obtaining an accurate determination
of the epidemic incidence and the critical thresholds. Epidemic containment
based on links' deactivation promises to be an effective tool to maintain
functionality on networks while controlling the spread of diseases, as for
example in air transportation networks.

popular methods for data detection in massive multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems. While L-MMSE equalization enables
near-optimal spectral efficiency, accurate knowledge of the signal and noise
powers is necessary. Furthermore, corresponding VLSI designs must solve linear
systems of equations, which requires high arithmetic precision, exhibits
stringent data dependencies, and results in high circuit complexity. This paper
proposes the first VLSI design of the NOnParametric Equalizer (NOPE), which
avoids knowledge of the transmit signal and noise powers, provably delivers the
performance of L-MMSE equalization for massive MU-MIMO systems, and is
resilient to numerous system and hardware impairments due to its parameter-free
nature. Moreover, NOPE avoids computation of a matrix inverse and only requires
hardware-friendly matrix-vector multiplications. To showcase the practical
advantages of NOPE, we propose a parallel VLSI architecture and provide
synthesis results in 28nm CMOS. We demonstrate that NOPE performs on par with
existing data detectors for massive MU-MIMO that require accurate knowledge of

characterizing the dynamics of droplets of non-vanishing viscosity in

separating the droplet from the tube walls, for the droplet front and rear
curvatures and pressure jumps, and for the droplet velocity in a range of
capillary numbers, $Ca$, from $10^{-4}$ to $1$ and inner-to-outer viscosity
ratios, $\lambda$, from $0$, i.e. a bubble, to high viscosity droplets.
Theoretical asymptotic results obtained in the limit of small capillary number
are combined with accurate numerical simulations at larger $Ca$. With these
models at hand, we can compute the pressure drop induced by the droplet. The
film thickness at low capillary numbers ($Ca<10^{-3}$) agrees well with
Bretherton's scaling for bubbles as long as $\lambda<1$. For larger viscosity
ratios, the film thickness increases monotonically, before saturating for
$\lambda>10^3$ to a value $2^{2/3}$ times larger than the film thickness of a
bubble. At larger capillary numbers, the film thickness follows the rational
function proposed by Aussillous \& Qu\'er\'e (2000) for bubbles, with a fitting
coefficient which is viscosity-ratio dependent. This coefficient modifies the
value to which the film thickness saturates at large capillary numbers. The
velocity of the droplet is found to be strongly dependent on the capillary
number and viscosity ratio. We also show that the normal viscous stresses at
the front and rear caps of the droplets cannot be neglected when calculating
the pressure drop for $Ca>10^{-3}$.

nonconvex procedures for solving statistical estimation problems. Due to the
highly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures
often require proper regularization (e.g. trimming, regularized cost,
projection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such
as gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly
conservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks
performance guarantees.
  This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in
the absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper
regularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient
descent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry,
consisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This ""implicit
regularization"" feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more
aggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial
computational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation
problems, i.e. phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind
deconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal
statistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In
particular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory,
we develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative
algorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a byproduct, for noisy
matrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal
error control --- measured entrywise and by the spectral norm --- which might
be of independent interest.

$\sim$20$\%$ of the local DM density could dominate the signal, while colder

$N_{\rm GW}$ needed to harden a BHB to the point that inspiral due to
gravitational wave emission occurs before the next three-body scattering event.
This is done independently for both the spherical and disk components. Using a
Monte Carlo approach, we refine our calculations for $N_{\rm GW}$ to include
gravitational wave emission between scattering events. For astrophysically
plausible models we find that typically $N_{\rm GW} \lesssim$ 10.
  We find two separate regimes for the efficient dynamical hardening of BHBs:
(1) spherical star clusters with high central densities, low velocity
dispersions and no significant Keplerian component; and (2) migration traps in
disks around SMBHs lacking any significant spherical stellar component in the
vicinity of the migration trap, which is expected due to effective orbital
inclination reduction of any spherical population by the disk. We also find a
weak correlation between the ratio of the second-order velocity moment to
velocity dispersion in galactic nuclei and the rate of BHB mergers, where this
ratio is a proxy for the ratio between the rotation- and dispersion-supported
components. Because disks enforce planar interactions that are efficient in
hardening BHBs, particularly in migration traps, they have high merger rates
that can contribute significantly to the rate of BHB mergers detected by the
advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

e_2$ can be as large as 0.3 for small $e_1 \neq 0$. The more eccentric the
perturber, the more the particle's eccentricity and inclination vary; also,
more polar orbits are more chaotic. Our inverse solutions may be applied to the
Kuiper belt and debris disks, circumbinary planets, and stellar systems.

$\sim10^5\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and minimum gas softening of $\sim180$~pc) within
ETHOS to date -- plus a CDM counterpart -- to quantify the abundance of

predicts galaxies with higher ultraviolet (UV) luminosities than their CDM
counterparts and a faster build-up of the faint end of the UV luminosity
function. These effects, however, make the optical depth to reionization less
sensitive to the power spectrum cut-off: the ETHOS model differs from the CDM
$\tau$ value by only 10 per cent and is consistent with Planck limits if the
effective escape fraction of UV photons is 0.1-0.5. We conclude that current
observations of high-redshift luminosity functions cannot differentiate between
ETHOS and CDM models, but deep JWST surveys of strongly-lensed, inherently
faint galaxies have the potential to test non-CDM models that offer attractive
solutions to CDM's Local Group problems.

scale continue to elude our experimental observation. This fact is commonly
attributed to decoherence processes affecting systems of sufficiently large
number of constituent subsystems leading to an effective macro-scale beyond
which a quantum description of the whole system becomes superfluous. Here, we
show both theoretically and experimentally that the existence of such a scale

variant of the Wigner's friend experiment in which a multiparticle quantum
system is observed by the friend. The friend undergoes rapid decoherence
through her interactions with the environment. In the usual version of this
thought experiment, decoherence removes the need for Wigner to treat her as a
quantum system. However, for our variant we prove theoretically and observe
experimentally that there exist partitions of the subsystems in which the
friend is entangled with one of the particles in assistance with the other
particle, as observed by Wigner. Importantly, we show that the friend is
indispensable for the entanglement to be observed. Hence Wigner is compelled to
treat the friend as part of a larger quantum system. By analyzing our scenario
in the context of a quantum key distribution protocol, we show that a
semi-classical description of the experiment is suboptimal for security
analysis, highlighting the significance of the quantum description of the

We intend to fill this gap in the literature by discussing the main arguments

as through quantization or discretization, and microstructure that is not
directly motivated from GR, such as strings, quantum bits or condensed matter
fields. The emergent gravity approach can then be defined as the view that the
metric field and its dynamics are derivable from the latter type of
microstructure. Subsequently, we assess in how far the following properties of
(semi-classical) GR are suggestive of underlying microstructure: (1) the
metric's universal coupling to matter fields, (2) perturbative
non-renormalizability, (3) black hole thermodynamics, and (4) the holographic

rest-frame colours. We present spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to
determine the mid-infrared AGN contribution for the radio sources and use this
information to classify them as High- versus Low-Excitation Radio Galaxies
(HERGs and LERGs) or Star-Forming galaxies. Based on these classifications we
construct luminosity functions for the separate redshift ranges going out to $z
= 2$. From the matched radio-optical catalogues, we select a sub-sample of
$624$ high power ($P_{150\mathrm{\,MHz}}>10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) radio sources
between $0.5 \leq z < 2$. For this sample, we study the fraction of galaxies
hosting HERGs and LERGs as a function of stellar mass and host galaxy colour.
The fraction of HERGs increases with redshift, as does the fraction of sources
in galaxies with lower stellar masses. We find that the fraction of galaxies
that host LERGs is a strong function of stellar mass as it is in the local
Universe. This, combined with the strong negative evolution of the LERG
luminosity functions over this redshift range, is consistent with LERGs being

operating science flights, we demonstrate that observations with the Faint
Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) can provide reliable
estimates of the internal luminosities, $L_{\rm int}$, of protostars. We have
developed a technique to estimate $L_{\rm int}$ using a pair of FORCAST
filters: one ""short-wavelength"" filter centered within 19.7-25.3 $\mu$m, and
one ""long-wavelength"" filter within 31.5-37.1 $\mu$m. These $L_{\rm int}$
estimates are reliable to within 30-40% for 67% of protostars and to within a
factor of 2.3-2.6 for 99% of protostars. The filter pair comprised of
F25.3$\mu$m and F37.1$\mu$m achieves the best sensitivity and most constrained
results. We evaluate several assumptions that could lead to systematic
uncertainties. The OH5 dust opacity matches observational constraints for
protostellar environments best, though not perfectly; we find that any improved
dust model will have a small impact of 5-10% on the $L_{\rm int}$ estimates.
For protostellar envelopes, the TSC84 model yields masses that are twice those
of the Ulrich model, but we conclude this mass difference does not
significantly impact results at the mid-infrared wavelengths probed by FORCAST.
Thus, FORCAST is a powerful instrument for luminosity studies targeting newly
discovered protostars or suspected protostars lacking detections longward of 24
$\mu$m. Furthermore, with its dynamic range and greater angular resolution,
FORCAST may be used to characterize protostars that were either saturated or
merged with other sources in previous surveys using the Spitzer Space Telescope
or Herschel Space Observatory.

expected to grow by ~30% since z~1, largely through ongoing mergers that are
also invoked to explain the observed increase in galaxy sizes. Direct evidence
for the corresponding growth in stellar mass has been elusive, however, in part
because the volumes sampled by previous redshift surveys have been too small to
yield reliable statistics. In this work, we make use of the Stripe 82 Massive
Galaxy Catalog to build a mass-limited sample of 41,770 galaxies (Mstar >
1.6e11) with optical to near-IR photometry and a large fraction (>55%) of
spectroscopic redshifts. Our sample spans 139 square degrees, significantly
larger than most previous efforts. After accounting for a number of potential
systematic errors, including the effects of Mstar scatter, we measure galaxy
stellar mass functions over 0.3 < z < 0.65 and detect no growth in the typical
Mstar of massive galaxies with an uncertainty of 9%. This confidence level is
dominated by uncertainties in the star formation history assumed for Mstar
estimates, although our inability to characterize low surface-brightness
outskirts may be the most important limitation of our study. Even among these
high-mass galaxies, we find evidence for differential evolution when splitting
the sample by recent star formation (SF) activity. While low-SF systems appear
to become completely passive, we find a mostly sub-dominant population of
galaxies with residual, but low rates of star formation (~1 Msun/yr) number
density does not evolve. Interestingly, these galaxies become more prominent at
higher Mstar, representing ~10% of all galaxies at Mstar ~ 1e12 Msun and
perhaps dominating at even larger masses.

calcium-alumino-silicate-hydrate (C-(N)-A-S-H) gel, the major binding phase of
silicate-activated blast furnace slag (one type of low-CO$_2$ cement), is
investigated from a drying perspective, since it is known to suffer extensively
from drying-induced microcracking. By employing in situ synchrotron X-ray total
scattering measurements and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis we show
that the significant contributing factor to the strain development in this
material at extremely low relative humidity (0%) is the local atomic structural
rearrangement of the C-(N)-A-S-H gel, including collapse of interlayer spacing
and slight disintegration of the gel. Moreover, analysis of the medium range
(1.0 - 2.2 nm) ordering in the PDF data reveals that the PDF-derived strain
values are in much closer agreement (same order of magnitude) with the
macroscopically measured strain data, compared to previous results based on
reciprocal space X-ray diffraction data. From a mitigation standpoint, we show
that small amounts of ZrO$_2$ nanoparticles are able to actively reinforce the
structure of silicate-activated slag during drying, preventing atomic level
strains from developing. Mechanistically, these nanoparticles induce growth of
a silica-rich gel during drying, which, via density functional theory
calculations, we show is attributed to the high surface reactivity of

The mass scales entailed by the top partner and vector resonance sectors will

Kawamura and Cook (2012) to allow for the treatment of a wider class of
representations. The main novelty is to endow represented spaces of interest
with an additional function on names, called a parameter, which measures the
complexity of a given name. This parameter generalises the size function which
is usually used in second-order complexity theory and therefore also central to
the framework of Kawamura and Cook. The complexity of an algorithm is measured
in terms of its running time as a second-order function in the parameter, as
well as in terms of how much it increases the complexity of a given name, as
measured by the parameters on the input and output side.
  As an application we develop a rigorous computational complexity theory for
interval computation. In the framework of Kawamura and Cook the representation
of real numbers based on nested interval enclosures does not yield a reasonable
complexity theory. In our new framework this representation is polytime
equivalent to the usual Cauchy representation based on dyadic rational
approximation. By contrast, the representation of continuous real functions
based on interval enclosures is strictly smaller in the polytime reducibility
lattice than the usual representation, which encodes a modulus of continuity.
Furthermore, the function space representation based on interval enclosures is
optimal in the sense that it contains the minimal amount of information amongst
those representations which render evaluation polytime computable.

highly effective at capturing CO$_2$. Based on theoretical analysis comprised
of ab-initio quantum mechanical calculations and force-field molecular dynamics
simulations, we show that this single-layer phase is robust and maintains its
stability even at high temperatures. The chemical activity of portlandene is
seen to further increase upon defect engineering of its surface using vacancy
sites. Defect-containing portlandene is capable of separating CO and CO$_2$
from a syngas (CO/CO$_2$/H$_2$) stream, yet is inert to water vapor. This
selective behavior and the associated mechanisms have been elucidated by
examining the electronic structure, local charge distribution and bonding
orbitals of portlandene. Additionally, unlike conventional CO$_2$ capturing
technologies, the regeneration process of portlandene does not require high
temperature heat treatment since it can release the captured CO$_2$ by
application of a mild external electric field, making portlandene an ideal
CO$_2$ capturing material for both pre- and post-combustion processes.

absorption strengths in these desert regions, and comparisons with theoretical
stellar population models are used to determine the time since the last
significant star formation activity, and hence the ages of the bars. We find
typical ages of approx. 1 Gyr, but with a broad range, much larger than would
be expected from measurement errors alone, extending from about 0.25 Gyr to
more than 4 Gyr. Low-level residual star formation, or mixing of stars from
outside the 'desert' regions, could result in a doubling of these age

over the additive white Gaussian (AWGN) channel under iterative decoding
algorithms. While problems involving the general category of trapping sets, and
the subcategory of elementary trapping sets (ETSs), have been shown to be
NP-hard, similar results for LETSs, which are a subset of ETSs are not
available. In this paper, we prove that, for a general LDPC code, finding a
LETS of a given size a with minimum number of unsatisfied check nodes b is
NP-hard to approximate with any guaranteed precision. We also prove that
finding the minimum size a of a LETS with a given b is NP-hard to approximate.
Similar results are proved for elementary absorbing sets, a popular subcategory
of LETSs.

the GDCs are completely dominated by the cold dust component and range from
$\sim$1.1$\cdot$10$^{3}$ - 1.4$\cdot$10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. The GDCs have
effective temperatures of $\sim$13-23 K and show a distinct cold dust effective
temperature gradient from the centre towards the outer parts of the stellar

$\sim$16% of the total dust mass of NGC 300, which we estimate to be about
5.4$\cdot$10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$. At least about 87% of our GDCs have a high
enough average dust mass surface density to provide sufficient shielding to
harbour molecular clouds. We compare our results to previous pointed molecular
gas observations in NGC 300 and results from other nearby galaxies and also

are renormalizable, gauge and Lorentz invariant. Thus, on general grounds, one
expects such couplings between the Higgs and an inflaton in quantum field

the need for reheating the Universe after inflation, whereby the inflaton
decays into the Standard Model (SM) particles. Such a coupling necessarily
leads to the Higgs-inflaton mixing, which could stabilize the electroweak
vacuum by increasing the Higgs self-coupling. We find that the inflationary
constraints on the trilinear coupling are weak such that the Higgs-inflaton
mixing up to order one is allowed, making it accessible to colliders. This
entails an exciting possibility of a direct inflaton search at the LHC.

motion of crystalline defects known as dislocations. Here, we extend an
analysis for the energetic stability of a straight dislocation, the so-called
line tension ($\Gamma$), to steady-state moving dislocations within elastically
anisotropic media.
  Upon simplification to isotropy, our model reduces to an explicit analytical
form yielding insight into the behavior of $\Gamma$ with increasing velocity.
We find that at the first shear wave speed within an isotropic solid, the screw
dislocation line tension diverges positively indicating infinite stability. The
edge dislocation line tension, on the other hand, changes sign at approximately
$80\%$ of the first shear wave speed, and subsequently diverges negatively
indicating that the straight configuration is energetically unstable.
  In anisotropic crystals, the dependence of $\Gamma$ on the dislocation
velocity is significantly more complex; At velocities approaching the first
shear wave speed within the plane of the crystal defined by the dislocation
line, $\Gamma$ tends to diverge, with the sign of the divergence strongly
dependent on both the elastic properties of the crystal, and the orientation of
the dislocation line. We interpret our analyses within the context of recent
molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of the motion of dislocations near the
first shear wave speed. Both the simulations and our analyses are indicative of
instabilities of nominally edge dislocations within fcc crystals approaching
the first shear wave speed. We apply our analyses towards predicting the
behavior of dislocations within bcc crystals in the vicinity of the first shear
wave speed.

algorithm to generate results and possibly optimize this ranking based on

of the user and simply provides recommendations dynamically without properly
understanding the thought process of the user. An intelligent recommender
system is not only useful for the user but also for businesses which want to
learn the tendencies of their users. Finding out tendencies or intents of a
user is a difficult problem to solve.
  Keeping this in mind, we sought out to create an intelligent system which
will keep track of the user's activity on a web-application as well as
determine the intent of the user in each session. We devised a way to encode
the user's activity through the sessions. Then, we have represented the
information seen by the user in a high dimensional format which is reduced to
lower dimensions using tensor factorization techniques. The aspect of intent
awareness (or scoring) is dealt with at this stage. Finally, combining the user
activity data with the contextual information gives the recommendation score.
The final recommendations are then ranked using filtering and collaborative
recommendation techniques to show the top-k recommendations to the user. A
provision for feedback is also envisioned in the current system which informs
the model to update the various weights in the recommender system. Our overall
model aims to combine both frequency-based and context-based recommendation
systems and quantify the intent of a user to provide better recommendations.
  We ran experiments on real-world timestamped user activity data, in the
setting of recommending reports to the users of a business analytics tool and
the results are better than the baselines. We also tuned certain aspects of our
model to arrive at optimized results.

more than one fundamental domains is also possible. We also provide a
constructive way for forming a Gabor window functions for a given upper

unambiguous signatures of young protostars manifest as approaching and receding
lobes of dense gas swept up by the jets created during the formation and early
evolution of stars. The lobe masses and momentum transfer rates are consistent
with young protostellar outflows found throughout the disk of the Galaxy. The
mean dynamical age of the outflow population is estimated to be
$6.5^{+8.1}_{-3.6}\times10^3$ years. The rate of star formation is
$\sim5\times10^{-4}$\msol\,yr$^{-1}$ assuming a mean stellar mass of $\sim0.3$
\msol. This discovery provides evidence that star formation is taking place
within clouds surprisingly close to Sgr A*, perhaps due to events that compress
the host cloud, creating condensations with sufficient self-gravity to resist
tidal disruption by Sgr A*. Low-mass star formation over the past few billion
years at this level would contribute significantly to the stellar mass budget
in the central few pc of the Galaxy. The presence of many dense clumps of
molecular material within 1pc of Sgr A* suggests that star formation could take
place in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of

investigation owing to its relevance to locomotion control, especially in the
context of schooling and target following. Many successful wake sensing
strategies have been devised based on models of von Karman-type wakes; however,
such wake sensing technologies are invalid in the context of exotic wake types
that commonly arise in swimming locomotion. Indeed, exotic wakes can exhibit
markedly different dynamics, and so must be modeled and sensed accordingly.
Here, we propose a general wake detection protocol for distinguishing between
wake types from measured hydrodynamic signals alone. An ideal-flow model is
formulated and used to demonstrate the general wake detection framework in a
proof-of-concept study. We show that wakes with different underlying dynamics
impart distinct signatures on a fish-like body, which can be observed in
time-series measurements at a single location on the body surface. These
hydrodynamic wake signatures are used to construct a wake classification
library that is then used to classify unknown wakes from hydrodynamic signal
measurements. The wake detection protocol is found to have an accuracy rate of
over 95% in the majority of performance studies conducted here. Thus, exotic
wake detection is shown to be viable, which suggests that such technologies
have the potential to become key enablers of multi-model sensing and locomotion
control strategies in the future.

breast MR images can aid in the prediction of occult invasive disease following
the di- agnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by core needle biopsy.
Material and Methods: In this institutional review board-approved study, we
analyzed dynamic contrast-enhanced fat-saturated T1-weighted MRI sequences of
131 patients at our institution with a core needle biopsy-confirmed diagnosis
of DCIS. The patients had no preoperative therapy before breast MRI and no
prior history of breast cancer. We explored two different deep learning
approaches to predict whether there was a hidden (occult) invasive component in
the analyzed tumors that was ultimately detected at surgical excision. In the
first approach, we adopted the transfer learning strategy, in which a network
pre-trained on a large dataset of natural images is fine-tuned with our DCIS
images. Specifically, we used the GoogleNet model pre-trained on the ImageNet
dataset. In the second approach, we used a pre-trained network to extract deep
features, and a support vector machine (SVM) that utilizes these features to
predict the upstaging of the DCIS. We used 10-fold cross validation and the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) to estimate the performance of the predictive
models. Results: The best classification performance was obtained using the
deep features approach with GoogleNet model pre-trained on ImageNet as the
feature extractor and a polynomial kernel SVM used as the classifier (AUC =
0.70, 95% CI: 0.58- 0.79). For the transfer learning based approach, the
highest AUC obtained was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.41-0.62). Conclusion: Convolutional
neural networks could potentially be used to identify occult invasive disease
in patients diagnosed with DCIS at the initial core needle biopsy.

Noetherian ring is Artinian. Many non-commutative Noetherian rings whose
injective hulls of simple modules are locally Artinian have been extensively
studied recently. This property had been denoted by property $(\diamond)$. In
this paper we investigate, which non-Noetherian semiprimary commutative
quasi-local rings $(R, m)$ satisfy property $(\diamond)$. For quasi-local rings
$(R,m)$ with $m^3=0$, we prove a characterisation of this property in terms of
the dual space of $Soc(R)$. Furthermore, we show that $(R,m)$ satisfies
$(\diamond)$ if and only if its associated graded ring $gr(R)$ does.
  Given a field $F$ and vector spaces $V$ and $W$ and a symmetric bilinear map
$\beta:V\times V\rightarrow W$ we consider commutative quasi-local rings of the
form $F\times V \times W$, whose product is given by $(\lambda_1,

patient outcomes by tailoring treatment to individual characteristics. An
individualized treatment rule formalizes precision medicine as a map from
patient information to a recommended treatment. A treatment rule is defined to
be optimal if it maximizes the mean of a scalar outcome in a population of
interest, e.g., symptom reduction. However, clinical and intervention
scientists often must balance multiple and possibly competing outcomes, e.g.,
symptom reduction and the risk of an adverse event. One approach to precision
medicine in this setting is to elicit a composite outcome which balances all
competing outcomes; unfortunately, eliciting a composite outcome directly from
patients is difficult without a high-quality instrument, and an expert-derived
composite outcome may not account for heterogeneity in patient preferences. We
propose a new paradigm for the study of precision medicine using observational
data that relies solely on the assumption that clinicians are approximately
(i.e., imperfectly) making decisions to maximize individual patient utility.
Estimated composite outcomes are subsequently used to construct an estimator of
an individualized treatment rule which maximizes the mean of patient-specific
composite outcomes. The estimated composite outcomes and estimated optimal
individualized treatment rule provide new insights into patient preference
heterogeneity, clinician behavior, and the value of precision medicine in a
given domain. We derive inference procedures for the proposed estimators under
mild conditions and demonstrate their finite sample performance through a suite
of simulation experiments and an illustrative application to data from a study

maximization problems for multi-agent systems. In these problems, agents have
utilities for connecting to each other, and the goal is to compute a
maximum-utility solution subject to a set of constraints. We represent these as
a class of graph optimization problems, including matching, spanning tree
problems, TSP, maximum weight planar subgraph, and many others. We study these
problems in the ordinal setting: latent numerical utilities exist, but we only
have access to ordinal preference information, i.e., every agent specifies an
ordering over the other agents by preference. We prove that for the large class
of graph problems we identify, ordinal information is enough to compute
solutions which are close to optimal, thus demonstrating there is no need to
know the underlying numerical utilities. For example, for problems in this
class with bounded degree $b$ a simple ordinal greedy algorithm always produces
a ($b+1$)-approximation; we also quantify how the quality of ordinal
approximation depends on the sparsity of the resulting graphs. In particular,

outliers due to the distinct characteristics of various detection models,
complicated structures of data in certain applications, and imbalanced
distribution of outliers and normal instances. In addition, the role of
contrastive contexts where outliers locate, as well as the relation between
outliers and contexts, are usually overlooked in interpretation. To tackle the
issues above, in this paper, we propose a novel Contextual Outlier
INterpretation (COIN) method to explain the abnormality of existing outliers
spotted by detectors. The interpretability for an outlier is achieved from
three aspects: outlierness score, attributes that contribute to the
abnormality, and contextual description of its neighborhoods. Experimental
results on various types of datasets demonstrate the flexibility and
effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with existing interpretation
approaches.

(extinction, age, metallicity, and star formation rate) of quiescent galaxies
within the rest-frame stellar mass$-$colour and $UVJ$ colour$-$colour diagrams
corrected for extinction up to $z\sim1$. These novel diagrams reduce the
contamination in samples of quiescent galaxies owing to dust-reddened galaxies,
and they provide useful constraints on stellar population parameters. We set
constraints on the stellar population parameters of quiescent galaxies
combining the ALHAMBRA multi-filter photo-spectra with our SED-fitting code
MUFFIT, making use of composite stellar population models. The extinction
obtained by MUFFIT allowed us to remove dusty star-forming (DSF) galaxies from
the sample of red $UVJ$ galaxies. The distributions of stellar population
parameters across these rest-frame diagrams are revealed after the dust
correction and are fitted by the LOESS method to reduce uncertainty effects.
Quiescent galaxy samples defined via classical $UVJ$ diagrams are typically
contaminated by a $\sim20$% fraction of DSF galaxies. A significant part of the
galaxies in the green valley are actually obscured star-forming galaxies
($\sim30-65$%). Consequently, the transition of galaxies from the blue cloud to
the red sequence, and hence the related mechanisms for quenching, seems to be
much more efficient and faster than previously reported. The rest-frame stellar
mass$-$colour and $UVJ$ colour$-$colour diagrams are useful for constraining
the age, metallicity, extinction, and star formation rate of quiescent galaxies
by only their redshift, rest-frame colours, and/or stellar mass. Dust
correction plays an important role in understanding how quiescent galaxies are
distributed in these diagrams and is key to performing a pure selection of
quiescent galaxies via intrinsic colours.

spectroscopic observations from VLT/MUSE, VLT/X-SHOOTER and other instruments.
Together, these data provide a wide range of rest-frame wavelength (765 \AA$\,$

evidence for jet gas interactions affecting the kinematic properties of the

feedback. We suggest that the regions of relatively lower ionization level,
spatially correlated with the radio hotspots, may be due to localised
compression of photoionized gas by the expanding radio source, thereby lowering
the ionization parameter, or due to a contribution from shock-heating. We find
that photoionization of super-solar metallicity gas ($Z/Z_{\odot}$ = 2.1) by an
AGN-like continuum ($\alpha$=--1.0) at a moderate ionization parameter ($U$ =
0.018) gives the best overall fit to the complete X-SHOOTER emission line
spectrum. We identify a strong degeneracy between column density and Doppler
parameter such that it is possible to obtain a reasonable fit to the \ion{H}{I}
absorption feature across the range log N(\ion{H}{I}/cm$^{-2}$) = 15.20 and
19.63, with the two best-fitting occurring near the extreme ends of this range.
The extended \ion{H}{I} absorber is blueshifted relative to the emission line

the domain space and the test (or dual) space of the operator, products require
a notion of the range. In the boundary element software package Bempp we have
implemented a complete operator algebra that depends on knowledge of the
domain, range and test space. The aim was to develop a way of working with
Galerkin operators in boundary element software that is as close to working
with the strong form on paper as possible while hiding the complexities of
Galerkin discretisations. In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation of
this operator algebra and show, using various Laplace and Helmholtz example
problems, how it significantly simplifies the definition and solution of a wide
range of typical boundary integral equation problems.

systems, the problem of dynamic sensor activation for the tracking of a
time-varying process is examined. The tradeoff is between energy efficiency,
which decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity, which
increases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing the
time-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under the
constraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods artfully
combine three key ingredients: Gibbs sampling, stochastic approximation for
learning, and modifications to consensus algorithms to create a high
performance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with active sensor selection.
The following progression of scenarios are considered: centralized tracking of
an i.i.d. process; distributed tracking of an i.i.d. process and finally
distributed tracking of a Markov chain. The challenge of the i.i.d. case is
that the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown
parameter which must be learned. The key theoretical results prove that the
proposed algorithms converge to local optima for the two i.i.d process cases;
numerical results suggest that global optimality is in fact achieved. The
proposed distributed tracking algorithm for a Markov chain, based on
Kalman-consensus filtering and stochastic approximation, is seen to offer an
error performance comparable to that of a competetive centralized Kalman
filter.

an explanation for the significant dips observed by Kepler, as well as the
recent May to October 2017 dips and the long term variation in flux detected by
Simon et al. (2017). Whereas the presence of such a ring structure is
attractive for its ability to explain short term fade events, we do not address
how such a ring system can be created and maintained. If our speculation is
correct, a brightening of about 1-2 percent should occur during October to
November 2017. In addition, this scenario predicts that a set of dimming

not subhalos) that have a final virial mass $M_{\mathrm{vir}}$ at $z = 0$ less
than their peak mass ($M_{\mathrm{peak}}$) in the Bolshoi-Planck cosmological
simulation. We identify two primary causes of halo mass loss: relaxation after
a major merger and tidal stripping by a massive neighbouring halo. Major
mergers initially boost $M_{\mathrm{vir}}$ and typically cause the final halo
to become more prolate and less relaxed and to have higher spin and lower NFW
concentration. As the halo relaxes, high energy material from the recent merger
gradually escapes beyond the virial radius, temporarily resulting in a net
negative accretion rate that reduces the halo mass by $5-15\%$ on average.
Halos that experience a major merger around $z = 0.4$ typically reach a minimum
mass near $z = 0$. Tidal stripping mainly occurs in dense regions, and it
causes halos to become less prolate and have lower spins and higher NFW
concentrations. Tidally stripped halos often lose a large fraction of their
peak mass ($> 20\%$) and most never recover (or even reattain a positive
accretion rate). Low mass halos can be strongly affected by both post-merger
mass loss and tidal stripping, while high mass halos are predominantly
influenced by post-merger mass loss and show few signs of significant tidal
stripping.

strategy, will detect $66\%$ of the PHA and $61\%$ of the NEO population
objects brighter than $H=22$, with the uncertainty in the estimate of $\pm5$
percentage points. By generating and examining variations on the baseline

the constant growth of the supercomputers performance, however, they are still
unattainable for lots of real-life problems. The key shortcoming of these
methods is related to the need of simulating a long time integration interval
to collect reliable statistics, while the time integration process is
inherently sequential. The novel approach with modelling of multiple flow
states is discussed in the paper. The suggested numerical procedure allows to
parallelize the integration in time by the cost of additional computations.
Multiple realizations of the same turbulent flow are performed simultaneously.
This allows to use more efficient implementations of numerical methods for
solving systems of linear algebraic equations with multiple right-hand sides,
operating with blocks of vectors. The simple theoretical estimate for the
expected simulation speedup, accounting the penalty of additional computations

weaker magnetic field and larger Doppler factor, which cause the ineffective

$4.0\times 10^{45}~\rm{ erg\cdot s}^{-1}$, comparing with radiation power,
$5.0\times 10^{42}~\rm{ erg\cdot s}^{-1}$, indicating that only a small

Lacs with large Doppler factors, their jet components could have two
substructures, e.g., the fast core and the slow sheath. For most GeV-TeV BL
Lacs, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are suppressed by their higher magnetic
fields, leading few micro-variability or intro-day variability in the optical

in the form of off-center orbiting clouds, is a common presence in bright
group-centered galaxies (BGG). CO line widths are $\gtrsim 10$ times broader
than Galactic molecular clouds, and using the reference Milky Way $X_{CO}$, the
total molecular mass ranges from as low as $2.6\times 10^5 M_\odot$ in NGC~4636
to $6.1\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in NGC~5044. With these parameters the virial
parameters of the molecular structures is $\gg 1$. Complementary observations
of NGC~5846 and NGC~4636 using the ALMA Compact Array (ACA) do not exhibit any
detection of a CO diffuse component at the sensitivity level achieved by
current exposures. The origin of the detected molecular features is still
uncertain, but these ALMA observations suggest that they are the end product of
the hot gas cooling process and not the result of merger events. Some of the
molecular clouds are associated with dust features as revealed by HST dust
extinction maps suggesting that these clouds formed from dust-enhanced cooling.
The global nonlinear condensation may be triggered via the chaotic turbulent
field or buoyant uplift. The large virial parameter of the molecular structures
and correlation with the warm ($10^3 - 10^5 K$)/hot ($\ge10^6$) phase velocity
dispersion provide evidence that they are unbound giant molecular associations
drifting in the turbulent field, consistently with numerical predictions of the
chaotic cold accretion process. Alternatively, the observed large CO line
widths may be generated by molecular gas flowing out from cloud surfaces due to
heating by the local hot gas atmosphere.

etc. are commonly used to identify critical nodes in a graph. These methods are
based on two assumptions that restrict their wider applicability. First, they
assume the exact topology of the network is available. Secondly, they do not
take into account the activity over the network and only rely on its topology.
However, in many applications, the network is autonomous, vast, and
distributed, and it is hard to collect the exact topology. At the same time,
the underlying pairwise activity between node pairs is not uniform and node
criticality strongly depends on the activity on the underlying network.
  In this paper, we propose active betweenness cardinality, as a new measure,
where the node criticalities are based on not the static structure, but the
activity of the network. We show how this metric can be computed efficiently by
using only local information for a given node and how we can find the most
critical nodes starting from only a few nodes. We also show how this metric can
be used to monitor a network and identify failed nodes.We present experimental
results to show effectiveness by demonstrating how the failed nodes can be

in finite time, while remaining inside a safe set S. Our approach synthesizes
switched controllers that select between finitely many modes to satisfy the
given RWS specification. To do so, we consider control certificates, which are
Lyapunov-like functions that represent control strategies to achieve the
desired specification. However, for RWS problems, a control Lyapunov-like
function is often hard to synthesize in a simple polynomial form. Therefore, we
combine control barrier and Lyapunov functions with an additional compatibility
condition between them. Using this approach, the controller synthesis problem
reduces to one of solving quantified nonlinear constrained problems that are
handled using a combination of SMT solvers. The synthesis of controllers is
demonstrated through a set of interesting numerical examples drawn from the
related work, and compared with the state-of-the-art tool SCOTS. Our evaluation
suggests that our approach is computationally feasible, and adds to the growing

its capability to provide a quality, reliable and high-speed data transmission
amongst the users. However, transmission of information in wireless channels is
primarily impaired by deleterious multipath fading, which affects the quality
and reliability of the system. In order to overcome the detrimental effects of
fading, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology is an attractive
scheme that employs multiple transceiver antennas to carry the data over the
same frequency band over a variety of signal paths. This technology has shown
great solutions due to its ability to provide better spectral efficiency,
capacity, throughput and robustness of the data transmission. But in practice,
it is impractical to install multiple antennas on small-sized devices. Hence,
to overcome the limitations of MIMO gain in the future wireless networks,
cooperative diversity has recently draw in attention due to its ability to
circumvent the difficulties of implementing actual antenna arrays in
Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO). By exploiting the broadcast feature
of the wireless medium, cooperation among multiple nearby nodes is formed for
data transmission. At the receiver, the signals are either coherently or
differentially detected. Coherent detection requires exact channel estimation,
which is difficult to apply in a time-varying channel. Hence, when the nodes
are mobile, or when the channel is inaccurately estimated, the differential
detection techniques that omit channel estimation become an alternative as
compared to coherent detection. This article presents a review of the
differential transmission techniques for cooperative diversity networks.

To study this coupling and its role in parallel shock formation, a new

utilizes high-energy and high-repetition-rate lasers to create a
super-Alfv\'{e}nic field-aligned debris plasma within an ambient plasma in the
Large Plasma Device (LAPD). We used a time-resolved fluorescence monochromator
and an array of Langmuir probes to characterize the laser plasma velocity
distribution and density. The debris ions were observed to be sufficiently
super-Alfv\'{e}nic and dense to excite the RHI. Measurements with magnetic flux
probes exhibited a right-hand circularly polarized frequency chirp consistent
with the excitation of the RHI near the laser target. We compared measurements
to 2D hybrid simulations of the experiment.

Then, we develop a novel V2I cybersecurity architecture, named CVGuard, which
can detect and prevent cyberattacks on the V2I environment. In designing
CVGuard, key challenges, such as scalability, resiliency and future usability
were considered. A case study using a distributed denial of service (DDoS) on a
V2I application, i.e., the Stop Sign Gap Assist (SSGA) application, shows that
CVGuard was effective in mitigating the adverse effects created by a DDoS
attack. In our case study, because of the DDoS attack, conflicts between the
minor and major road vehicles occurred in an unsignalized intersection, which
could have caused potential crashes. A reduction of conflicts between vehicles
occurred because CVGuard was in operation. The reduction of conflicts was
compared based on the number of conflicts before and after the implementation
and operation of the CVGuard security platform. Analysis revealed that the
strategies adopted by the CVGuard were successful in reducing the inter-vehicle
conflicts by 60% where a DDoS attack compromised the SSGA application at an
unsignalized intersection.

regulatory parties. The key to precision medicine is the optimal treatment
regime. Recently, Zhou et al. (2017) developed residual weighted learning (RWL)
to construct the optimal regime that directly optimize the clinical outcome.
However, this method involves computationally intensive non-convex
optimization, which cannot guarantee a global solution. Furthermore, this
method does not possess fully semiparametrical efficiency. In this article, we
propose augmented outcome-weighted learning (AOL). The method is built on a
doubly robust augmented inverse probability weighted estimator, and hence
constructs semiparametrically efficient regimes. Our proposed AOL is closely
related to RWL. The weights are obtained from counterfactual residuals, where
negative residuals are reflected to positive and accordingly their treatment
assignments are switched to opposites. Convex loss functions are thus applied
to guarantee a global solution and to reduce computations. We show that AOL is
universally consistent, i.e., the estimated regime of AOL converges the Bayes
regime when the sample size approaches infinity, without knowing any specifics
of the distribution of the data. We also propose variable selection methods for
linear and nonlinear regimes, respectively, to further improve performance. The
performance of the proposed AOL methods is illustrated in simulation studies
and in an analysis of the Nefazodone-CBASP clinical trial data.

Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in an end-to-end way to model the pedestrian, seen as
a sequence of body parts from head to foot. Integrating the contextual

also leverage the complementary information between local and global feature.
Furthermore, we integrate both identification task and ranking task in one

learned concurrently. This results in a novel three-branch framework named
Deep-Person, which learns highly discriminative features for person Re-ID.
Experimental results demonstrate that Deep-Person outperforms the

surjects onto a non-abelian free group. By work of Agol and Cooper-Long-Reid,
most 3-manifold groups are large; in particular, the fundamental groups of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds are large. In previous work, the first author gave
examples of closed, hyperbolic 3-manifolds with arbitrarily large first
homology rank but whose fundamental groups do not surject onto a non-abelian
free group. We call a group very large if it surjects onto a non-abelian free
group. In this paper, we consider the question of whether the groups of
homology handlebodies - which are very close to being free - are very large. We
show that the fundamental group of W. Thurston's tripus manifold, is not very
large; it is known to be weakly parafree by Stallings' Theorem and large by the
work of Cooper-Long-Reid since the tripus is a hyperbolic manifold with totally
geodesic boundary. It is still unknown if a 3-manifold group that is weakly
parafree of rank at least 3 must be very large. However, we more generally
consider the co-rank of the fundamental group, also known as the cut number of
the manifold. For each positive integer g we construct a homology handlebody
Y_g of genus g whose group has co-rank equal to r(g), where r(g)=g/2 for g even
and r(g)=(g+1)/2 for g odd. That is, these groups are weakly parafree of rank g
and surject onto a free group of rank roughly half of g but no larger.

represent 3D data to feed deep networks. Recent works have relied on volumetric

issues such as computational complexity, unordered data, and lack of finer
geometry. This paper demonstrates that a mesh representation (i.e. vertices and
faces to form polygonal surfaces) is able to capture fine-grained geometry for
3D reconstruction tasks. A mesh however is also unstructured data similar to
point clouds. We address this problem by proposing a learning framework to
infer the parameters of a compact mesh representation rather than learning from
the mesh itself. This compact representation encodes a mesh using free-form
deformation and a sparse linear combination of models allowing us to
reconstruct 3D meshes from single images. In contrast to prior work, we do not
rely on silhouettes and landmarks to perform 3D reconstruction. We evaluate our
method on synthetic and real-world datasets with very promising results. Our
framework efficiently reconstructs 3D objects in a low-dimensional way while

table. At each step either an empty plate is put down, an olive is put down on

plates that both have olives on them are combined on one of the two plates,
with the other plate removed. Plates are indistinguishable from one another, as
are olives, and there is an inexhaustible supply of each.
  The game derives from the consideration of Morse functions on the $2$-sphere.
Specifically, the number of topological equivalence classes of excellent Morse
functions on the $2$-sphere that have order $n$ (that is, that have $2n+2$
critical points) is the same as the number of ways of returning to an empty

  Nicolaescu gave the lower bound $M_n \geq (2n-1)!! = (2/e)^{n+o(n)}n^n$ and

feature sets about common entities. They aim to learn a linear model jointly in
a federated setting, namely, data is local and a shared model is trained from
locally computed updates. In contrast with most work on distributed learning,
in this scenario (i) data is split vertically, i.e. by features, (ii) only one
data provider knows the target variable and (iii) entities are not linked
across the data providers. Hence, to the challenge of private learning, we add
the potentially negative consequences of mistakes in entity resolution. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we describe a three-party end-to-end solution
in two phases ---privacy-preserving entity resolution and federated logistic
regression over messages encrypted with an additively homomorphic scheme---,
secure against a honest-but-curious adversary. The system allows learning
without either exposing data in the clear or sharing which entities the data
providers have in common. Our implementation is as accurate as a naive
non-private solution that brings all data in one place, and scales to problems
with millions of entities with hundreds of features. Second, we provide what is
to our knowledge the first formal analysis of the impact of entity resolution's
mistakes on learning, with results on how optimal classifiers, empirical
losses, margins and generalisation abilities are affected. Our results bring a
clear and strong support for federated learning: under reasonable assumptions
on the number and magnitude of entity resolution's mistakes, it can be
extremely beneficial to carry out federated learning in the setting where each
peer's data provides a significant uplift to the other.

a face image, i.e., to generate a new face with desired attributes while
preserving other details. Recently, generative adversarial net (GAN) and
encoder-decoder architecture are usually incorporated to handle this task with
promising results. Based on the encoder-decoder architecture, facial attribute
editing is achieved by decoding the latent representation of the given face
conditioned on the desired attributes. Some existing methods attempt to
establish an attribute-independent latent representation for further attribute
editing. However, such attribute-independent constraint on the latent
representation is excessive because it restricts the capacity of the latent
representation and may result in information loss, leading to over-smooth and
distorted generation. Instead of imposing constraints on the latent
representation, in this work we apply an attribute classification constraint to
the generated image to just guarantee the correct change of desired attributes,
i.e., to ""change what you want"". Meanwhile, the reconstruction learning is
introduced to preserve attribute-excluding details, in other words, to ""only
change what you want"". Besides, the adversarial learning is employed for
visually realistic editing. These three components cooperate with each other
forming an effective framework for high quality facial attribute editing,
referred as AttGAN. Furthermore, our method is also directly applicable for
attribute intensity control and can be naturally extended for attribute style
manipulation. Experiments on CelebA dataset show that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-arts on realistic attribute editing with facial details well
preserved.

second-order Kuramoto oscillators bearing homogeneous (heterogeneous)
degree-distribution is known to display the first-order (second-order)

having homogeneous degree-distribution support the first-order transition in
both the layers thereby facilitating ES. More interesting is the multiplexing
of a layer bearing heterogeneous degree-distribution with another layer bearing
homogeneous degree-distribution, which induces a first-order (ES) transition in
the heterogeneous layer which was incapable of showing the same in the
isolation. Further, we report that such induced ES transition in the
heterogeneous layer of multiplex networks can be controlled by varying inter

multiplexing or impact of one layer on dynamical evolution of other layers of

fragment distributions by investigating the competition between the static
structure of the collective manifold and stochastic dynamics. In particular, we
study the characteristics of the tails of yield distributions, which correspond
to very asymmetric fission. We use the stochastic Langevin framework to
simulate the nuclear evolution after the system tunnels through the
multi-dimensional potential barrier. For a representative sample of different
initial configurations along the outer turning-point line, we define effective
fission paths by computing a large number of Langevin trajectories. We extract
the relative contribution of each such path to the fragment distribution. We
then use nucleon localization functions along effective fission pathways to
analyze the characteristics of prefragments at pre-scission configurations. We
find that non-Newtonian Langevin trajectories, strongly impacted by the random
force, produce the tails of the fission fragment distribution. The prefragments
deduced from nucleon localizations are formed early and change little as the
nucleus evolves towards scission. On the other hand, the system contains many
nucleons that are not localized in the prefragments, even near the scission
point. Such nucleons are rapidly distributed at scission to form the final
fragments. Our study shows that only theoretical models of fission that account
for some form of dissipative/stochastic dynamics can give an accurate
description of the structure of fragment distributions. In particular, it
should be nearly impossible to predict the tails of these distributions within
the standard formulation of time-dependent density functional theory. At the
same time, the large number of non-localized nucleons during fission suggests
that adiabatic approaches are ill-suited to describe fission fragment
properties.

related to the motion of other facial local regions. In this paper, a novel

proposed to interpret the important relations between local dynamics for
estimating facial traits from expression sequence. The facial dynamics
interpreter network is designed to be able to encode a relational importance,
which is used for interpreting the relation between facial local dynamics and
estimating facial traits. By comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the
proposed method has been verified. The important relations between facial local

Is it
necessary to generate the entire object up front, or is it possible to provide
query access to the object and sample it incrementally ""on-the-fly""? Such an
implementation should emulate the object by answering queries in a manner
consistent with a random instance sampled from the true distribution.
  Our first set of results focus on undirected graphs with independent edge
probabilities, under certain assumptions. Then, we use this to obtain the first
efficient implementations for the Erdos-Renyi model and the Stochastic Block
model. As in previous local-access implementations for random graphs, we
support Vertex-Pair and Next-Neighbor queries. We also introduce a new
Random-Neighbor query.
  Next, we show how to implement random Catalan objects, specifically focusing
on Dyck paths (always positive random walks on the integer line). Here, we
support Height queries to find the position of the walk, and First-Return
queries to find the time when the walk returns to a specified height. This in
turn can be used to implement Next-Neighbor queries on random rooted/binary
trees, and Matching-Bracket queries on random well bracketed expressions.
  Finally, we define a new model that: (1) allows multiple independent
simultaneous instantiations of the same implementation to be consistent with
each other without communication (2) allows us to generate a richer class of
random objects that do not have a succinct description. Specifically, we study
uniformly random valid $q$-colorings of an input graph $G$ with max degree
$\Delta$. The distribution over valid colorings is specified via a ""huge""
underlying graph $G$, that is far too large to be read in sub-linear time.
Instead, we access $G$ through local neighborhood probes. We are able to answer
queries to the color of any vertex in sub-linear time for $q > 9\Delta$.

system, where a receiver (Rx) simultaneously detects the signals transmitted
from an active transmitter (Tx) and a backscatter Tag. Specifically, the
information-carrying signal sent by the Tx arrives at the Rx through two
wireless channels: the direct channel from the Tx to the Rx, and the
backscatter channel from the Tx to the Tag and then to the Rx. The received
signal from the backscatter channel also carries the Tag's information because
of the multiplicative backscatter operation at the Tag. This multiple-access
system introduces a new channel model, referred to as multiplicative
multiple-access channel (M-MAC). We analyze the achievable rate region of the
M-MAC, and prove that its region is strictly larger than that of the
conventional time-division multiple-access scheme in many cases, including,
e.g., the high SNR regime and the case when the direct channel is much stronger
than the backscatter channel. Hence, the multiplicative multiple-access scheme
is an attractive technique to improve the throughput for ambient backscatter
communication systems. Moreover, we analyze the detection error rates for
coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes adopted by the Tx and the Tag,
respectively, in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, which further
bring interesting insights for practical system design.

consistent particle sizes for the Bagnold dunes (~110-350 microns, and are
within measurement and model uncertainties), indicating that particle sizes of
homogeneous materials determined from orbit are reliable. Furthermore, we
examine the effects of two physical characteristics that could influence the
modeled thermal inertia and particle sizes, including: 1) fine-scale (cm-m
scale) ripples, and 2) thin layering of indurated/armored materials. To first
order, we find small scale ripples and thin (approximately centimeter scale)
layers do not significantly affect the determination of bulk thermal inertia
from orbital thermal data determined from a single nighttime temperature.
Modeling of a layer of coarse or indurated material reveals that a thin layer
(< ~5 mm; similar to what was observed by the Curiosity rover) would not
significantly change the observed thermal properties of the surface and would
be dominated by the properties of the underlying material. Thermal inertia and
grain sizes of relatively homogeneous materials derived from nighttime orbital

identified between $r = 50$ kpc and 300 kpc, most of which are beyond the reach
of previous large surveys including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that
the global structure of the stellar halo in this range has substructures, which
are especially remarkable in the GAMA15H and XMM-LSS fields in the HSC-SSP. We
find that the stellar halo can be fitted to a single power-law density profile
with an index of $\alpha \simeq 3.3$ ($3.5$) with (without) these fields and
its global axial ratio is $q \simeq 2.2$ ($1.3$). Thus, the stellar halo may be
significantly disturbed and be made in a prolate form by halo substructures,
perhaps associated with the Sagittarius stream in its extension beyond $r \sim

descriptors employed to discuss the photophysics and photochemistry of
transition metal complexes. In transition metal complexes, the interaction
between the metal and the different ligands gives rise to a rich variety of
excited states, including metal-centered, intra-ligand, metal-to-ligand charge
transfer, ligand-to-metal charge transfer, and ligand-to-ligand charge transfer
states. Most often, these excited states are identified by considering the most
important wave function excitation coefficients and inspecting visually the
involved orbitals. This procedure is tedious, subjective, and imprecise.
Instead, automatic and quantitative techniques for excited-state
characterization are desirable. In this contribution we review the concept of
charge transfer numbers---as implemented in the TheoDORE package---and show its
wide applicability to characterize the excited states of transition metal
complexes. Charge transfer numbers are a formal way to analyze an excited state
in terms of electron transitions between groups of atoms based only on the
well-defined transition density matrix. Its advantages are many: it can be
fully automatized for many excited states, is objective and reproducible, and
provides quantitative data useful for the discussion of trends or patterns. We
also introduce a formalism for spin-orbit-mixed states and a method for
statistical analysis of charge transfer numbers. The potential of this
technique is demonstrated for a number of prototypical transition metal
complexes containing Ir, Ru, and Re. Topics discussed include orbital
delocalization between metal and carbonyl ligands, nonradiative decay through
metal-centered states, effect of spin-orbit couplings on state character, and
comparison among results obtained from different electronic structure methods.

occupancy and user requests is proposed to turn the high-dimensional
optimization problem into three low-dimensional ones. Furthermore, a

attains close performance in comparison with theoretical bounds from

matter distribution is governed by the simplest form of the MIT bag model
equation of state (EOS) as $p=\frac{1}{3}\left(\rho-4B\right)$, where $B$ is
the bag constant. We have obtained an exact solution of the modified form of
the the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation in the framework of
$f(R,\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory and studied the dependence of different
physical properties, viz., total mass, radius, energy density and pressure on
the chosen values of $\chi$. Further, to examine physical acceptability of the
proposed stellar model in detail, we conducted different tests, viz. energy
conditions, modified TOV equation, mass-radius relation, causality condition
etc. We have precisely explained the effects arising due to the coupling of the
matter and geometry on the compact stellar system. For a chosen value of the
Bag constant we have predicted numerical values of different physical
parameters in tabular format for the different strange stars. It is found that
as the factor $\chi$ increases the strange stars shrink gradually and become
less massive to turn into a more compact stellar system. The maximum mass point
is well within the observational limits and hence our proposed model is
suitable to explain the ultra dense compact stars. For $\chi=0$ we retrieve as
usual the standard results of general relativity (GR).

structure. Oxygen exposure at 2.0 Pa for 10 min after deposition of the bottom
CFS layer was effective for obtaining PMA in the CFS layer. One of the reasons
for the PMA is the formation of nearly ideal CFS/MgO interfaces due to oxygen
exposure before the deposition of the MgO layer. The annealing process was
effective for obtaining PMA in the top CFS layer capped with a Pd layer. PMA
was clearly observed in the top CFS layer of a Cr(40 nm)/Pd(50 nm)/bottom
CFS(0.6 nm)/MgO(2.0 nm)/top CFS(0.6 nm)/Pd(10 nm) multilayer, where the top CFS
and Pd thin films were deposited at RT and subsequently annealed at 300{\deg}C.
In addition to the continuous layer growth of the films, the crystalline
orientation alignment at the top CFS/Pd interface probably attributes to the
origin of PMA at the top CFS layer.

various exotic properties for the topological states. In this paper, we
summarize and briefly review work completed over the last few years, including
our own, regarding recent developments in several topics about disorder effects
in topological states. For weak disorder, the robustness of topological states
is demonstrated, especially for both quantum spin Hall states with $Z_2=1$ and
size induced nontrivial topological insulators with $Z_2=0$. For moderate
disorder, by increasing the randomness of both the impurity distribution and
the impurity induced potential, the topological insulator states can be created
from normal metallic or insulating states. These phenomena and their mechanisms
are summarized. For strong disorder, the disorder causes a metal-insulator
transition. Due to their topological nature, the phase diagrams are much richer
in topological state systems. Finally, the trends in these areas of disorder
research are discussed.

adaptation of kinemetry to parametrise the kinematic Halpha asymmetry of all
galaxies in the sample, and find a correlation between scatter (i.e. residuals
off the TFR) and asymmetry. This effect is pronounced at low stellar mass,
corresponding to the inverse relationship between stellar mass and kinematic
asymmetry found in previous work. For galaxies with log(M*) < 9.5, 25 +/- 3%
are scattered below the root mean square (RMS) of the TFR, whereas for galaxies
with log(M*) > 9.5 the fraction is 10 +/- 1% We use 'simulated slits' to
directly compare our results with those from long slit spectroscopy and find
that aligning slits with the photometric, rather than the kinematic, position
angle, increases global scatter below the TFR. Further, kinematic asymmetry is
correlated with misalignment between the photometric and kinematic position
angles. This work demonstrates the value of 2D spatially resolved kinematics
for accurate TFR studies; integral field spectroscopy reduces the
underestimation of rotation velocity that can occur from slit positioning off
the kinematic axis.

information network (HIN) has been adopted to characterize complex and
heterogeneous auxiliary data in recommender systems, called HIN based
recommendation. It is challenging to develop effective methods for HIN based
recommendation in both extraction and exploitation of the information from
HINs. Most of HIN based recommendation methods rely on path based similarity,
which cannot fully mine latent structure features of users and items. In this
paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding based approach for
HIN based recommendation, called HERec. To embed HINs, we design a meta-path
based random walk strategy to generate meaningful node sequences for network
embedding. The learned node embeddings are first transformed by a set of fusion
functions, and subsequently integrated into an extended matrix factorization
(MF) model. The extended MF model together with fusion functions are jointly
optimized for the rating prediction task. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HERec model. Moreover,
we show the capability of the HERec model for the cold-start problem, and
reveal that the transformed embedding information from HINs can improve the
recommendation performance.

large time of the solutions u^$\epsilon$ of two deterministic models of

mutations. The first model is the so-called Lotka-Volterra parabolic PDE in R d

the first model to a finite phenotype space. The solutions of such systems
typically concentrate as Dirac masses in the limit $\epsilon$ $\rightarrow$ 0.
Our main results are, in both cases, the representation of the limits of
$\epsilon$ log u^$\epsilon$ as solutions of variational problems and regularity
results for these limits. The method mainly relies on Feynman-Kac type
representations of u $\epsilon$ and Varadhan's Lemma. Our probabilistic
approach applies to multi-resources situations not covered by standard
analytical methods and makes the link between variational limit problems and
Hamilton-Jacobi equations with irregular Hamiltonians that arise naturally from
analytical methods. The finite case presents substantial difficulties since the
rate function of the associated large deviation principle has non-compact level
sets. In that case, we are also able to obtain uniqueness of the solution of
the variational problem and of the associated differential problem which can be
interpreted as a Hamilton-Jacobi equation in finite state space.

cylindrical magnetic flux tube of radius $a$ embedded in a magnetic field B_i
and surrounded by rest magnetized plasma with magnetic field B_e. We explore
the propagation of the kink MHD mode along the jet that can become unstable
against the KHI if its speed exceeds a critical value. Concerning magnetic
fields topology we consider three different configurations, notably of (i)
spatially homogeneous magnetic fields (untwisted magnetic flux tube), (ii)
internal (label `i') twisted magnetic field and external homogeneous one (label
`e') (single-twisted flux tube), and (iii) both internal and external twisted
magnetic fields (double-twisted magnetic flux tube). Plasma densities in the
two media rho_i and rho_e are assumed to be homogeneous. The density contrast
is defined in two ways: first as rho_e/rho_i and second as rho_e/(rho_i +
rho_e). Computations show that the KHI can occur at accessible flow velocities
in all the cases of untwisted and single-twisted flux tubes. It turns out,
however, that in the case of a double-twisted flux tube the KHI can merge at an
accessible jet speed only when the density contrast is calculated from the
ratio rho_e/(rho_i} + rho_e). Evaluated KHI developing times and kink mode wave
phase velocities at wavelength of 4 Mm lie in the ranges of 1--6.2 min and

structure with local statistics while translation, we design a dual pathway
model with one coarse discriminator and one fine discriminator. For generator,
we provide one extra perceptual loss in association with adversarial loss and
cycle consistency loss to achieve representation learning for two different

associated with abrupt changes in crystalline lattice geometry or in the

topological transition is at the basis of the formation of an unusual
pressure-induced tetragonal ferromagnetic phase in Fe$_{1.08}$Te. Around 2 GPa,
the orthorhombic and incommensurate antiferromagnetic ground-state of
Fe$_{1.08}$Te is transformed upon increasing pressure into a tetragonal
ferromagnetic state via a conventional first-order transition. On the other
hand, an isostructural transition takes place from the paramagnetic
high-temperature state into the ferromagnetic phase as a rare case of a `type
0' transformation with anisotropic properties. Electronic-structure
calculations in combination with electrical resistivity, magnetization, and
x-ray diffraction experiments show that the electronic system of Fe$_{1.08}$Te
is instable with respect to profound topological transitions that can drive
fundamental changes of the lattice anisotropy and the associated magnetic
order.

Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed
distribution (i.e., only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical
property of real-world networks, such as social networks. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning representations for scale-free networks. We first
theoretically analyze the difficulty of embedding and reconstructing a
scale-free network in the Euclidean space, by converting our problem to the
sphere packing problem. Then, we propose the ""degree penalty"" principle for
designing scale-free property preserving network embedding algorithm: punishing
the proximity between high-degree vertexes. We introduce two implementations of
our principle by utilizing the spectral techniques and a skip-gram model
respectively. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our algorithms
are able to not only reconstruct heavy-tailed distributed degree distribution,
but also outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various network mining
tasks, such as vertex classification and link prediction.

joint power control and time allocation while taking into account circuit power
consumption. For both NOMA and TDMA strategies, we show that it is optimal for
each machine type communication device (MTCD) to transmit with the minimum
throughput, and the energy consumption of each MTCD is a convex function with
respect to the allocated transmission time. Based on the derived optimal
conditions for the transmission power of MTCDs, we transform the original
optimization problem for NOMA to an equivalent problem which can be solved
suboptimally via an iterative power control and time allocation algorithm.
Through an appropriate variable transformation, we also transform the original
optimization problem for TDMA to an equivalent tractable problem, which can be
iteratively solved. Numerical results verify the theoretical findings and
demonstrate that NOMA consumes less total energy than TDMA at low circuit power

Colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) $M_J/J-K_s$ and $M_G/G-J$ were used to verify
CPM candidates from UCAC5. Assuming their common distance with a given TGAS

many living microorganisms. It is characterized by straight swimming intervals
(runs), which are interrupted by sudden reorientation events (tumbles). In
contrast, directional changes of synthetic microswimmers (active particles,
APs) are caused by rotational diffusion, which is superimposed with their
translational motion and thus leads to rather continuous and slow particle
reorientations. Here we demonstrate that active particles can also perform a
swimming motion where translational and orientational changes are disentangled,
similar to RNT. In our system, such motion is realized by a viscoelastic
solvent and a periodic modulation of the self-propulsion velocity.
Experimentally, this is achieved using light-activated Janus colloids, which
are illuminated by a time-dependent laser field. We observe a strong
enhancement of the effective translational and rotational motion when the
modulation time is comparable to the relaxation time of the viscoelastic fluid.
Our findings are explained by the relaxation of the elastic stress, which
builds up during the self-propulsion, and is suddenly released when the
activity is turned off. In addition to a better understanding of active motion
in viscoelastic surroundings, our results may suggest novel steering strategies
for synthetic microswimmers in complex environments.

linearly constrained convex problems, which has already been widely used but
actually lacks theoretical justification. Namely, the penalty parameter
steadily increases and the penalized objective function is minimized inexactly
rather than exactly, e.g., with only one step of the proximal gradient descent.
For such a variant of the quadratic penalty method, we give counterexamples to
show that it may not give a solution to the original constrained problem. By
choosing special penalty parameters, we ensure the convergence and further
establish the convergence rates of $O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$ for the
generally convex problems and $O\left(\frac{1}{K}\right)$ for strongly convex
ones, where $K$ is the number of iterations. Furthermore, by adopting
Nesterov's extrapolation we show that the convergence rates can be improved to
$O\left(\frac{1}{K}\right)$ for the generally convex problems and
$O\left(\frac{1}{K^2}\right)$ for strongly convex ones.
  When applied to the decentralized distributed optimization, the penalty
methods studied in this paper become the widely used distributed gradient
method and the fast distributed gradient method. However, due to the totally
different analysis framework, we can improve their $O\left(\frac{\log
K}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$ and $O\left(\frac{\log K}{K}\right)$ convergence rates to
$O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$ and $O\left(\frac{1}{K}\right)$ with fewer

communication efficient version, i.e., finding an $\varepsilon$ solution in
$O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ communications and
$O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2+\delta}}\right)$ computations for the

show that, while having the potential to break time-reversal symmetry, iron
impurities with a coverage of up to 0.25 monolayers do not have any further

measured the spin-momentum locking of electrons from the TSS by means of

decay of photoholes introduced in the photoemission process, and by this gain
insight into the many-body interactions in the system. Surprisingly, we extract
quasiparticle lifetimes comparable to other topological materials where the TSS

chemical reactions occurring on their surfaces -- changes in the chemical
composition of the solution in which they are immersed. This process leads to
gradients in chemical composition along the surface of the particle, as well as
along any nearby boundaries, including solid walls. Chemical gradients along a
wall can give rise to chemi-osmosis, i.e., the gradients drive surface flows
which, in turn, drive flow in the volume of the solution. This bulk flow
couples back to the particle, and thus contributes to its self-motility. Since
chemi-osmosis strongly depends on the molecular interactions between the
diffusing molecular species and the wall, the response flow induced and
experienced by a particle encodes information about any chemical patterning of
the wall. Here, we extend previous studies on self-phoresis of a sphere near a
chemically patterned wall to the case of particles with elongated shape. We
focus our analysis on the new phenomenology potentially emerging from the
coupling -- which is inoperative for a spherical shape -- of the elongated
particle to the strain rate tensor of the chemi-osmotic flow. Via numerical
calculations, we show that the dynamics of a rod-like particle exhibits a novel
""edge-following"" steady state: the particle translates along the edge of a
chemical step at a steady distance from the step and with a steady orientation.
Within a certain range of system parameters, the edge-following state co-exists
with a ""docking"" state (the particle stops at the step, oriented perpendicular
to the step edge), i.e., a bistable dynamics occurs. These findings are
rationalized as a consequence of the competition between fluid vorticity and
the rate of strain by using analytical theory based on the point-particle
approximation which captures quasi-quantitatively the dynamics of the system.

demonstrate that coherence in the initial three qubit system can significantly
increase the bounding second order cooling rate. We study the efficiency of the

results strongly suggest that the deactivations(NBRs) detected by the new

also considered to be activations. Therefore, the right-tailed t-test, which is

misspecifications is required. In these situations, we suggest to resort to a
posterior distribution for the parameter of interest based on proper scoring
rules. Scoring rules are loss functions designed to measure the quality of a
probability distribution for a random variable, given its observed value.
Important examples are the Tsallis score and the Hyv\""arinen score, which allow
us to deal with model misspecifications or with complex models. Also the full
and the composite likelihoods are both special instances of scoring rules.
  The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we discuss the use of scoring
rules in the Bayes formula in order to compute a posterior distribution, named
SR-posterior distribution, and we derive its asymptotic normality. Secondly, we
propose a procedure for building default priors for the unknown parameter of
interest that can be used to update the information provided by the scoring
rule in the SR-posterior distribution. In particular, a reference prior is
obtained by maximizing the average $\alpha-$divergence from the SR-posterior
distribution. For $0 \leq |\alpha|<1$, the result is a Jeffreys-type prior that
is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the Godambe
information matrix associated to the scoring rule. Some examples are discussed.

temperatures of about 20 MK and that the range of temperatures is relatively
narrow. The highest temperatures occur at the base of the current sheet, in the
region near the top of the post-flare loop arcade. The broadest high
temperature line profiles, in contrast, occur at the largest observed heights.
Further, line broadening is strong very early in the flare and diminishes over
time. The current sheet can be observed in the AIA 211 and 171 channels, which
have a considerable contribution from thermal bremsstrahlung at flare
temperatures. Comparisons of the emission measure in these channels with other
EIS wavelengths and AIA channels dominated by Fe line emission indicate a
coronal composition and suggest that the current sheet is formed by the heating
of plasma already in the corona. Taken together, these observations suggest
that some flare heating occurs in the current sheet while additional energy is
released as newly reconnected field lines relax and become more dipolar.

Herschel selected hyper luminous (LIR(8-1000um) > 10^13Lsun) infrared galaxies
with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). CO(1 - 0) measurements are a vital tool to
trace the bulk molecular gas mass across all redshifts. Our results place tight
constraints on the total gas content of these most apparently luminous high-z
star-forming galaxies (apparent IR luminosities of LIR > 10^(13-14) Lsun),
while we confirm their predetermined redshifts measured using the Large
Millimeter Telescope, LMT (zCO = 1.33 - 3.26). The CO(1 - 0) lines show similar
profiles as compared to Jup = 2 -4 transitions previously observed with the
LMT. We report enhanced infrared to CO line luminosity ratios of
<LIR/L'CO(1-0)> = 110 (pm 22) Lsun(K km s^-1 pc^-2)^-1 compared to normal
star-forming galaxies, yet similar to those of well-studied IR-luminous
galaxies at high-z. We find average brightness temperature ratios of <r21> =
0.93 (2 sources), <r31> = 0.34 (5 sources), and <r41> = 0.18 (1 source). The
r31 and r41 values are roughly half the average values for SMGs. We estimate
the total gas mass content as uMH2 = (0.9 - 27.2) x 10^11(alphaCO/0.8)Msun,
where u is the magnification factor and alphaCO is the CO line luminosity to
molecular hydrogen gas mass conversion factor. The rapid gas depletion times
are, on average, tau = 80 Myr, which reveal vigorous starburst activity, and
contrast the Gyr depletion timescales observed in local, normal star-forming
galaxies.

constitutes the flagship channel. Based on this data set, the results of an
extensive partial-wave analysis (PWA), using a total of 88 partial waves in the
model, were published. Along with it, results of a first study of the so-called
freed-isobar method were shown. Here, the fixed amplitudes for appearing
$\pi^+\pi^-$ intermediate states used in the conventional analysis were
replaced by sets of piecewise constant functions to extract the amplitudes of
the $\pi^+\pi^-$ subsystems directly from the data. In this first study, this
was one for three $\pi$ partial waves with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ intermediate
$\pi^+\pi^-$ states. The promising results inspired further extension of this
method, by also freeing intermediate $\pi^+\pi^-$ states with $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$
and $2^{++}$. With this extension of the set of freed waves, mathematical
ambiguities in the model arise due to the much higher flexibility of the model.
We will present first results of these extended studies on COMPASS data along
with methods to resolve the arising ambiguities.

this signal is, however, buried under foregrounds that are many orders of
magnitude brighter. These must be removed accurately and precisely in order to
reveal the feeble 21-cm signal. This requires not only the modeling of the
Galactic and extra-galactic emission, but also of the often stochastic
residuals due to imperfect calibration of the data caused by ionospheric and
instrumental distortions. To stochastically model these effects, we introduce a
new method based on `Gaussian Process Regression' (GPR) which is able to
statistically separate the 21-cm signal from most of the foregrounds and other
contaminants. Using simulated LOFAR-EoR data that include strong instrumental
mode-mixing, we show that this method is capable of recovering the 21-cm signal
power spectrum across the entire range $k = 0.07 - 0.3 \ \rm{h\, cMpc^{-1}}$.
The GPR method is most optimal, having minimal and controllable impact on the
21-cm signal, when the foregrounds are correlated on frequency scales $\gtrsim
3$\,MHz and the rms of the signal has $\sigma_{\mathrm{21cm}} \gtrsim
0.1\,\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}$. This signal separation improves the 21-cm
power-spectrum sensitivity by a factor $\gtrsim 3$ compared to foreground
avoidance strategies and enables the sensitivity of current and future 21-cm

experiment observed spectra for galactic cosmic rays, specifically for protons,
electrons and positrons over a wide energy range, during what is called an A <
0 solar magnetic polarity cycle. Drift theory predicts a difference in the
behaviour for these oppositely charge particles during A < 0 cycles. An
opportunity was thus created to study the predicted charge-sign-dependent
modulation, also now for very quiet heliospheric conditions. A comprehensive
three-dimensional, drift modulation model has been used to study the solar
modulation for cosmic rays in detail with extensive comparison to the observed
PAMELA spectra for the mentioned period. First, this was done for protons and
secondly for electrons, as already published, to test and to authenticate the
modelling approach and then to come to a better understanding and appreciation
of the underlying physics, such as diffusion and drift theory. The results were
also used to make predictions of how cosmic rays are differently modulated down
to low energies (1 MeV) for the two magnetic polarity cycles of the Sun, and
what role drifts play in this process. All computed solutions are based on new
very local interstellar spectra, now also done for positrons. This report is
focussed on detailed aspects of the solar modulation of positrons during the
extraordinary quiet solar modulation period from 2006 to 2009. For the first

evaluation on relevant metrics according to the operational requirements for
tactical networks such as packet reception ratio, latency, energy consumption
and hop count. The results showed a trade-offs between clustered-based and
distributed-based dissemination approaches. With regards to packet delay,
distributed approach provided the best performance. However, in terms of
average packet reception ratio (PRR), clustered-based approach achieves up to
97% reception and remained the best strategy. Whereas, the results of the hop

high-recombining sequence, the targets of selection are individual genetic
loci; under low recombination, selection collectively acts on large,
genetically linked genomic segments. Selection under linkage can induce clonal
interference, a specific mode of evolution by competition of genetic clades
within a population. This mode is well known in asexually evolving microbes,
but has not been traced systematically in an obligate sexual organism. Here we
show that the Drosophila genome is partitioned into two modes of evolution: a
local interference regime with limited effects of genetic linkage, and an
interference condensate with clonal competition. We map these modes by
differences in mutation frequency spectra, and we show that the transition
between them occurs at a threshold recombination rate that is predictable from
genomic summary statistics. We find the interference condensate in segments of
low-recombining sequence that are located primarily in chromosomal regions
flanking the centromeres and cover about 20% of the Drosophila genome.
Condensate regions have characteristics of asexual evolution that impact gene
function: the efficacy of selection and the speed of evolution are lower and
the genetic load is higher than in regions of local interference. Our results
suggest that multicellular eukaryotes can harbor heterogeneous modes and tempi
of evolution within one genome. We argue that this variation generates

approximation of atomic wave functions in QED requires contributions of all
orders in \alpha. Bound state perturbation theory depends on the choice of this
first approximation, just as the Taylor expansion of an ordinary function
depends on the expansion point. Considering the expansion to be not in $\alpha$
but in $\hbar$, i.e., in the number of loops, defines the perturbative
expansion uniquely also for bound states. I show how the Schr\""odinger equation
for Positronium with the classical potential $V(r)=-\alpha/r$ corresponds to
the Born, $O(\hbar^0)$ bound state approximation in QED.
  Standard perturbation theory is based on an expansion around $O(\alpha^0)$
free states that have no overlap with bound states. Perturbing around bound
states requires using interacting $in$ and $out$ states. For Born states the
binding potential arises from a classical gauge field. In the absence of loops
the QCD scale $\Lambda_{QCD}$ can originate from a boundary condition imposed
on the solution of the classical gluon field equations. A perturbative
expansion may be relevant even for hadrons, if their non-perturbative features
such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are present already in the

arises from this study as a dynamical feature. The MSP in the HMF model is a
consequence of the Landau damping (LD) and it appears in systems that the
interactions belongs to a long range regime. Actually HMF is a toy model known
to show up the main characteristics of astrophysical systems due to the mean
field character of the potential and for different masses, as stellar and
galaxies clusters, also exhibits MSP. It is in this sense that computational
simulations focusing in what happens over the mass distribution in the phase
space are performed for this system. What happens through the violent
relaxation period and what stands for the quasi-stationary states (QSS) of this
dynamics is analyzed. The results obtained support the fact that MSP is
observed already in the violent relaxation time and is maintained during the
QSS. Some structures in the mass distribution function are observed. As a
result of this study the mass distribution is determined by the system dynamics
and is independent of the dimensionality of the system. MSP occurs in a one
dimensional system as a result of the long range forces that acts in the
system. In this approach MSP emerges as a dynamical feature. We also show that
for HMF with different masses, the dynamical time scale is $N$.

from our previous work that the efficiency of DSA depends on the shape of
electron spectra incident on the TS, which in turn depends on the spectral
shape of the very local interstellar spectrum. Modulation processes also
influence the efficiency of DSA. We find that TS accelerated electrons can make
contributions throughout the heliosphere to intensity levels, especially at
lower energies. An interesting result is that increases caused by DSA at the TS
are comparable in magnitude to electron intensity enhancements observed by
Voyager 1 ahead of the TS crossing. These intensity increases are large enough
to account for observed intensity peaks, and thus supports the view that DSA is
involved in their production. Additionally, the energy spectra observed by
Voyager 1 throughout the heliosheath are reproduced satisfactorily, as well as
the PAMELA spectrum at Earth at higher energies. We also find that an increase
in the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficients for these low-energy
electrons seems required to reproduce the spectral shape of observed modulated
spectra in the heliosheath at kinetic energy E < ~ 4 MeV. This is different
from intermediate energies where rigidity independent diffusion explains
observations satisfactory.

analysis of primordial perturbations to the Planck era and discuss the possible
effects of quantum geometry on the cosmic microwave background. Two approaches
to loop quantum cosmology with admissible ultraviolet behavior leading to
predictions that are compatible with observations are the so-called hybrid and
dressed metric approaches. In spite of their similarities and relations, we
show in this work that the effective equations that they provide for the
evolution of the tensor and scalar perturbations are somewhat different. When
backreaction is neglected, the discrepancy appears only in the time- dependent
mass term of the corresponding field equations. We explain the origin of this
difference, arising from the distinct quantization procedures. Besides, given
the privileged role that the big bounce plays in loop quantum cosmology, e.g.
as a natural instant of time to set initial conditions for the perturbations,
we also analyze the positivity of the time-dependent mass when this bounce
occurs. We prove that the mass of the tensor perturbations is positive in the
hybrid approach when the kinetic contribution to the energy density of the
inflaton dominates over its potential, as well as for a considerably large
sector of backgrounds around that situation, while this mass is always
nonpositive in the dressed metric approach. Similar results are demonstrated
for the scalar perturbations in a sector of background solutions that includes
the kinetically dominated ones; namely, the mass then is positive for the
hybrid approach, whereas it typically becomes negative in the dressed metric
case. More precisely, this last statement is strictly valid when the potential
is quadratic for values of the inflaton mass that are phenomenologically
favored.

inter-satellite optical wireless communication (IsOWC) systems. IsOWC systems
is the most significant application of the FSO and it will be installed in the
space in the near future because of its low input power, no licensing by ITU,
low cost, light weight, small size of the telescopes and very high data rates
as compared to the radio frequency (RF) satellite systems. In this research
article, IsOWC system is designed between LEO and GEO satellites by using
optisystem which is not stated in past examined research works. Inter-satellite
link is established between satellites which are separated by the distance of
40,000 Km at the bit rate of 10 Gbps.

Borrowing techniques from turbulence theory, we here establish a quantitative

a surprising type of turbulence-driven pattern formation far beyond linear

dark matter (CDM) is very successful at fitting cosmological observations, but
recent non-detections of candidate dark matter (DM) particles mean that various
modified-gravity theories remain of significant interest. The latter generally
involve modifications to GR below a critical acceleration scale $\sim 10^{-10}
\, m \, s^{-2}$. Wide-binary (WB) star systems with separations $> 5 \, kAU$
provide an interesting test for modified gravity, due to being in or near the
low-acceleration regime and presumably containing negligible DM. Here, we
explore the prospects for new observations pending from the GAIA spacecraft to
provide tests of GR against MOND or TeVes-like theories in a regime only
partially explored to date. In particular, we find that a histogram of (3D)
binary relative velocities against circular velocity predicted from the (2D)
projected separations predicts a rather sharp feature in this distribution for
standard gravity, with an 80th (90th) percentile value close to 1.025 (1.14)
with rather weak dependence on the eccentricity distribution. However,
MOND/TeVeS theories produce a shifted distribution, with a significant increase
in these upper percentiles. In MOND-like theories {\em without} an external
field effect, there are large shifts of order unity. With the external field
effect included, the shifts are considerably reduced to $\sim 0.04 - 0.08$, but
are still potentially detectable statistically given reasonably large samples
and good control of contaminants. In principle, followup of GAIA-selected wide
binaries with ground-based radial velocities accurate to < 0.03 km/s should be
able to produce an interesting new constraint on modified-gravity theories.

have shown that typical methanol dosage strategies produce a varying
carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the reactor, which in turn leads to unstable
nitrite concentrations in the effluent. The possibility of adding a model-free

SimBio model, which simulates the behavior of wastewater biofilters. The
corresponding ""intelligent"" feedback loop, which is using effluent nitrite
concentrations, compensates the classical strategy only when needed. Simulation
results show a clear improvement in average nitrite concentration level and

image, such as locations of hand joints, is challenging due to large viewpoint
changes and articulations, and severe self-occlusions exhibited particularly in
egocentric views. Both feature learning and prediction modeling have been
investigated to tackle the problem. Though effective, most existing
discriminative methods yield a single deterministic estimation of target poses.
Due to their single-value mapping intrinsic, they fail to adequately handle
self-occlusion problems, where occluded joints present multiple modes. In this
paper, we tackle the self-occlusion issue and provide a complete description of
observed poses given an input depth image by a novel method called hierarchical
mixture density networks (HMDN). The proposed method leverages the
state-of-the-art hand pose estimators based on Convolutional Neural Networks to
facilitate feature learning, while it models the multiple modes in a two-level
hierarchy to reconcile single-valued and multi-valued mapping in its output.
The whole framework with a mixture of two differentiable density functions is
naturally end-to-end trainable. In the experiments, HMDN produces interpretable
and diverse candidate samples, and significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks with occlusions, and performs
comparably on another benchmark free of occlusions.

instruments deployed in September 2005 to August 2006 across the four main
Arctic gateways: Davis, Fram and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening
(BSO). Sea ice transports are estimated from a sea ice assimilation product.
Monthly velocity fields are calculated with a box inverse model that enforces
volume and salinity conservation. The resulting net ocean and sea ice heat and
FW fluxes (annual mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation) are 175 $\pm$48 TW and 204
$\pm$85 mSv (respectively; 1 Sv = 10$^{6} m^{3} s^{-1}$). These boundary fluxes
accurately represent the annual means of the relevant surface fluxes. Oceanic
net heat transport variability is driven by temperature variability in upper
part of the water column and by volume transport variability in the Atlantic
Water layer. Oceanic net FW transport variability is dominated by Bering Strait
velocity variability. The net water mass transformation in the Arctic entails a
freshening and cooling of inflowing waters by 0.62$\pm$0.23 in salinity and
3.74$\pm$0.76C in temperature, respectively, and a reduction in density by
0.23$\pm$0.20 kg m$^{-3}$. The volume transport into the Arctic of waters
associated with this water mass transformation is 11.3$\pm$1.2 Sv, and the
export is -11.4$\pm$1.1 Sv. The boundary heat and FW fluxes provide a benchmark
data set for the validation of numerical models and atmospheric re-analyses

Applied to a large (1404 subjects) and documented database of FHR data,

stage of labor and continues to yield the best performance in the second stage;

the second stage;iii) babies suffering from fetal acidosis additionally show
more structured temporal dynamics than healthy ones and that this progressive

local structure and other physical properties. For example, when Mg is
partially substituted by Cu or Zn, the displacement of Cu or Zn is much larger
than that of Mg, and is even comparable to that of Nb. The polarization of
these systems is also increased, especially for the Cu-doped solution, due to
the large polarizability of Cu and Zn. As a result, the predicted maximum
dielectric constant temperatures ($T_m$) are increased. On the other hand, the
replacement of a Ti atom with a Mo or Tc dramatically decreases the
displacements of the cations and the polarization, and thus, the $T_m$ values
are also substantially decreased. The higher $T_m$ cannot be explained by the
conventional argument based on the ionic radii of the cations. Furthermore, we
find that Cu, Mo, or Tc doping increase the cations displacement disorder. The
effect of the dopants on the temperature dispersion ${\Delta}T_m$, which is the
change of $T_m$ for different frequencies, is also discussed. Our findings lay
the foundation for further investigations of unexplored dopants.

delay in predicting the expression. In an interactive setting, such as
affective interactive agents, such delay in the prediction could not be

On September 2016 the first data from Gaia were released (DR1). The
first release included photometry for over 10^9 sources in the very broad G
system. Aims. To test the correspondence between G magnitudes in DR1 and the
synthetic equivalents derived using spectral energy distributions from observed
and model spectrophotometry. To correct the G passband curve and to measure the
zero point in the Vega system. Methods. I have computed the synthetic G and
Tycho-2 BV photometry for a sample of stars using the Next Generation Spectral
Library (NGSL) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) CALSPEC spectroscopic
standards. Results. I have found that the nominal G passband curve is too blue
for the DR1 photometry, as shown by the presence of a color term in the
comparison between observed and synthetic magnitudes. A correction to the
passband applying a power law in lambda with an exponent of 0.783 eliminates
the color term. The corrected passband has a Vega zero point of 0.070$\pm$0.004
magnitudes.

  Non-Myersonian Approach",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the revenue maximization problem of a monopolist via a
non-Myersonian approach that could generalize to multiple items and multiple
buyers. Although such an approach does not lead to any closed-form solution of
the problem, it does provide some insights into this problem from different
angles. In particular, we consider both Bayesian (Bayesian Incentive Compatible
+ Bayesian Individually Rational) and Dominant-Strategy (Dominant-Strategy
Incentive Compatible + ex-post Individually Rational) implementations, where
all the buyers have additive valuations and quasi-linear utilities and all the
valuations are independent across buyers (not necessarily independent across
items).
  The main technique of our approach is to formulate the problem as an LP
(probably with exponential size) and apply primal-dual analysis. We observe
that any optimal solution of the dual program naturally defines the virtual
value functions for the primal revenue maximization problem in the sense that
any revenue-maximizing auction must be a virtual welfare maximizer (cf.
Myerson's auction for a single item [Myerson, 1981]).
  Based on this observation, we characterize a sufficient and necessary
condition for BIC = DSIC, i.e., the optimal revenue of Bayesian implementations
equals to the optimal revenue of dominant-strategy implementations (BRev =
DRev). The condition is if and only if the optimal DSIC revenue DRev can be
achieved by a DSIC and ex-post IR virtual welfare maximizer with
buyer-independent virtual value functions (buyer i's virtual value is
independent of other buyers' valuations). In light of the characterization, we
further show that when all the valuations are i.i.d., it is further equivalent
to that separate-selling is optimal. In particular, it respects one result from
the recent breakthrough work on the exact optimal solutions in the multi-item
multi-buyer setting by Yao [2016].

their choices knowing only average payoffs from the previous stages. A player's
strategy is a function from the convex hull $\mathfrak{S}$ of the set of
payoffs into the set $\{C,\,D\}$ ($C$ means cooperation, $D$ -- defection). S.
Smale in \cite{smale} presented an idea of good strategies in the repeated PD.
If both players play good strategies then the average payoffs tends to the
payoff corresponding to the profile $(C,C)$ in PD. We adopt the Smale idea to
define semi-cooperative strategies - players do not take as a referencing point
the payoff corresponding to the profile $(C,C)$, but they can take an arbitrary
payoff belonging to the $\beta$-core of PD. We show that if both players choose
the same point in the $\beta$-core then the strategy profile is an equilibrium
in the repeated game. If the players choose different points in the
$\beta$-core then the sequence of the average payoffs tends to a point in
$\mathfrak{S}$. The obtained limit can be treated as a payoff in a new game. In
this game the set of players' actions is the set of points in $S$ that
corresponds to the $\beta$-core payoffs.

Furthermore, the same prior can be used to invert deep neural representations

  Apart from its diverse applications, our approach highlights the inductive

popular in Bayesian learning due to its ability to deal with large data. A
standard SG-MCMC algorithm simulates samples from a discretized-time Markov
chain to approximate a target distribution. However, the samples are typically
highly correlated due to the sequential generation process, an undesired
property in SG-MCMC. In contrary, Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)
directly optimizes a set of particles, and it is able to approximate a target

to directly optimize particles (or samples) in SG-MCMC from scratch.
Specifically, we propose efficient methods to solve the corresponding
Fokker-Planck equation on the space of probability distributions, whose
solution (i.e., a distribution) is approximated by particles. Through our
framework, we are able to show connections of SG-MCMC to SVGD, as well as the

However, previous studies have merely built isolated, problem-specific models

we show with simulation and real-world data that the crowd wisdom problem is
analogous to one-dimensional unsupervised dimension reduction in machine
learning. This provides a natural class of crowd wisdom solutions, such as
principal component analysis and Isomap, which can handle binary and also
continuous responses, like confidence levels, and consequently can be more
accurate than existing solutions. They can even outperform
supervised-learning-based collective intelligence that is calibrated on
historical performance of individuals, e.g. penalized linear regression and
random forest. This study unifies crowd wisdom and unsupervised dimension
reduction, and thereupon introduces a broad range of highly-performing and
widely-applicable crowd wisdom methods. As the costs for data acquisition and

has continuously increased and cost has continuously decreased over decades.
This positive growth is a result of two key trends: (1) effective process
technology scaling; and (2) multi-level (e.g., MLC, TLC) cell data coding.
Unfortunately, the reliability of raw data stored in flash memory has also
continued to become more difficult to ensure, because these two trends lead to
(1) fewer electrons in the flash memory cell floating gate to represent the
data; and (2) larger cell-to-cell interference and disturbance effects. Without
mitigation, worsening reliability can reduce the lifetime of NAND flash memory.
As a result, flash memory controllers in solid-state drives (SSDs) have become
much more sophisticated: they incorporate many effective techniques to ensure
the correct interpretation of noisy data stored in flash memory cells.
  In this chapter, we review recent advances in SSD error characterization,
mitigation, and data recovery techniques for reliability and lifetime
improvement. We provide rigorous experimental data from state-of-the-art MLC
and TLC NAND flash devices on various types of flash memory errors, to motivate
the need for such techniques. Based on the understanding developed by the
experimental characterization, we describe several mitigation and recovery
techniques, including (1) cell-tocell interference mitigation; (2) optimal
multi-level cell sensing; (3) error correction using state-of-the-art
algorithms and methods; and (4) data recovery when error correction fails. We
quantify the reliability improvement provided by each of these techniques.
Looking forward, we briefly discuss how flash memory and these techniques could
evolve into the future.

privacy framework. Many existing studies employ traditional DP mechanisms
(e.g., the Laplace mechanism) as primitives to continuously release private
data for protecting privacy at each time point (i.e., event-level privacy),
which assume that the data at different time points are independent, or that
adversaries do not have knowledge of correlation between data. However,
continuously generated data tend to be temporally correlated, and such
correlations can be acquired by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate the
potential privacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism under temporal
correlations. First, we analyze the privacy leakage of a DP mechanism under
temporal correlation that can be modeled using Markov Chain. Our analysis
reveals that, the event-level privacy loss of a DP mechanism may
\textit{increase over time}. We call the unexpected privacy loss
\textit{temporal privacy leakage} (TPL). Although TPL may increase over time,
we find that its supremum may exist in some cases. Second, we design efficient
algorithms for calculating TPL. Third, we propose data releasing mechanisms
that convert any existing DP mechanism into one against TPL. Experiments
confirm that our approach is efficient and effective.

uncertainties in day-ahead electricity market clearing process in the presence
of demand response providers. A central challenge when dealing with many demand
response providers is the uncertainty of its realization. In this paper, a new
economic dispatch framework that is based on the recent theoretical development
of the scenario approach is introduced. By removing samples from a finite
uncertainty set, this approach improves dispatch performance while guaranteeing
a quantifiable risk level with respect to the probability of violating the
constraints. The theoretical bound on the level of risk is shown to be a
function of the number of scenarios removed. This is appealing to the system
operator for the following reasons: (1) the improvement of performance comes at
the cost of a quantifiable level of violation probability in the constraints;
(2) the violation upper bound does not depend on the probability distribution
assumption of the uncertainty in demand response. Numerical simulations on (1)
3-bus and (2) IEEE 14-bus system (3) IEEE 118-bus system suggest that this

exploitation and misuse behaviors coexist and the illegitimate user may act in
an intermittent and fast-changing manner, which brings about much uncertainty
for spectrum sensing. To tackle it, we firstly formulate the spectrum sensing
problems under illegitimate access and rogue power emission as a uniform
ternary hypothesis test. Then, we develop a novel test criterion, named the
generalized multi-hypothesis N-P criterion. Following the criterion, we derive
two test rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the R-test,
respectively, whose asymptotic performances are analyzed and an upper bound is
also given. Furthermore, a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is designed
based on the global N-P criterion to further improve the detection
performances. In addition, extensive simulations are provided to verify the
proposed schemes' performance under various parameter configurations.

photo-chemically produced compounds like ozone that we aim to observe to assess
habitability of exoplanets. We thus investigate a tidally locked ExoEarth
scenario for TRAPPIST-1b, TRAPPIST-1d, Proxima Centauri~b and GJ 667 C~f with a
simplified 3D atmosphere model and for different stratospheric wind breaking
assumptions.
  These planets are representatives for different circulation regimes for
orbital periods: $P_{orb}=1-100$~days. The circulation of exoplanets with
$P_{orb} \leq $ 25~days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave
in the troposphere and also in the stratosphere: It leads to a strong
equatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that
confines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the
distribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited
to an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with $P_{orb}>25$~days,
like GJ~667~C~f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the
stratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses.
  The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked
ExoEarths with $P_{orb} \leq 25$~days can, however, be circumvented with deep
stratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like
on Earth. For planets with $3 \leq P_{orb} \leq 6$~days, the extratropical
Rossby wave acts as an additional safe-guard against the tropical Rossby wave
in case of shallow wind breaking. Therefore, TRAPPIST-1d is less prone to have
an equatorial transport belt in the stratosphere than Proxima~Centauri~b.
  Even our Earth model shows an equatorial wind jet, if stratosphere wind
breaking is inefficient.

O32=[OIII]5007/[OII]3727=11.5. The escape fraction of the LyC radiation
fesc(LyC) in this galaxy is 46 per cent, the highest value found so far in

one of the lowest known for Lya-emitting galaxies, implying a high fesc(Lya).
Comparing the extinction-corrected Lya/Hb flux ratio with the case B value we
find fesc(Lya) = 98 per cent. Our observations, combined with previous
detections in the literature, reveal an increase of O32 with increasing
fesc(LyC). We also find a tight anticorrelation between fesc(LyC) and Vsep. The

bright star-forming region in the centre and an exponential disc in the

coupler of 99:1 and two thin-film mirrors located at the end of the fibre arms.
This configuration can be interrogated in reflection or in transmission
(whether if two fibre couplers are used in conventional configuration), however
the reflection interrogation presents better resolution when compared
signal-to-noise ratio in the decay time measurement. The mirrors can be also
replaced by fibre Bragg gratings and fibre loop mirrors. One of the main
advantages of this simplification is its use for remote sensing. However, it is
necessary to include amplification in the cavity to eliminate fiber length
losses. This configuration allows using any intensity-based optical fibre
sensor in the literature with twice improvement in the sensitivity and can be
easily adapted to a commercial system. A proof-of-concept for strain sensing is
demonstrated. This simplification opens new paths in physical, chemical or

i.e., the time that a particle performing a symmetric random walk in a
rectangular (2D) domain needs to cross the strip. We observe a complex
behavior, that is we find out that the residence time does not depend
monotonically on the geometric properties of the obstacle, such as its width,
length, and position. In some cases, due to the presence of the obstacle, the
mean residence time is shorter with respect to the one measured for the
obstacle--free strip. We explain the residence time behavior by developing a 1D
analog of the 2D model where the role of the obstacle is played by two defect
sites having a smaller probability to be crossed with respect to all the other
regular sites. The 1D and 2D models behave similarly, but in the 1D case we are
able to compute exactly the residence time finding a perfect match with the
Monte Carlo simulations.

$G[S]$ has at most $k$ vertices. We prove that for constant $k$, Max-$k$-OBCS
is hard to approximate within a factor of $n^{1 -\epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon

lower bound of $\sqrt{n}$ for Max-2-OBCS due to Orlovich et al. We provide
lower bounds on the approximability when $k$ is not a constant as well.
Max-$k$-OBCS can be seen as a generalization of Maximum Independent Set
(Max-IS). We generalize Tur\'an's greedy algorithm for Max-IS and prove that it
approximates Max-$k$-OBCS within a factor of $(2k - 1)\overline{d} + k$, where
$\overline{d}$ is the average degree of the input graph $G$. This approximation
factor is a generalization of Tur\'an's approximation factor for Max-IS.

play a major role. In general, for authentication, the client and the server
mutually exchange a common cryptographic key. In earlier, passwords were stored
on a single server. If an intruder gains access to the server by using some
malicious attacks, then all the passwords stored in the database be
compromised. So the e-commerce application security is endangered. In order to
improve the efficiency and performance of the authentication scheme, we
introduce multiple servers to store the passwords and participate in the key
exchange and authentication schemes. This ensures entire systems' security even
if a single server is compromised. The randomly generated nonce for each
session corresponding to two-level security mechanism where the scope of an
attacker pretends as legitimate user and login to the system is completely
restricted. In this method, passwords are stored in their equivalent hash

authentication scheme using a key exchange.

electromagnetic (EM) scattering from radially inhomogeneous spherical
structures (RISSs) based on the duality principle. According to the spherical
symmetry, similar angular dependencies in all the regions are considered using
spherical harmonics. To extract the radial dependency, the system of
differential equations of wave propagation toward the inhomogeneity direction
is equated with the dual planar ones. A general duality between electromagnetic
fields and parameters and scattering parameters of the two structures is
introduced. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through a
comprehensive example. The presented approach substitutes a complicated problem
in spherical coordinate to an easy, well posed, and a previously solved problem
in planar geometry. This approach is valid for all continuously varying
inhomogeneity profiles. One of the major advantages of the proposed method is
the capability of studying two general and applicable types of RISSs. As an
interesting application, a new class of lens antenna based on the physical
concept of the gradient refractive index material is introduced. The approach
is used to analyze the EM scattering from the structure and validate strong
performance of the lens.

uncertainty domain of uncertain-but-bounded parameters, which is very effective
for structural uncertainty analysis with limited or poor-quality experimental

convex models, in this paper, a unified framework for construction of the
non-probabilistic convex models is proposed. By introducing the correlation
analysis technique, the mathematical expression of a convex model can be
conveniently formulated once the correlation matrix of the uncertain parameters
is created. More importantly, from the theoretic analysis level, an evaluation
criterion for convex modelling methods is proposed, which can be regarded as a
test standard for validity verification of subsequent newly proposed convex
modelling methods. And from the practical application level, two model
assessment indexes are proposed, by which the adaptabilities of different
convex models to a specific uncertain problem with given experimental samples
can be estimated. Four numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the present study.
