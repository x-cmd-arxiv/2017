description of high-order harmonic generation with monochromatic excitation.
This method, although involves numerical calculations, is close to analytic
approaches with the corresponding deeper insight into the dynamics. As a first
application, we investigate the role of atomic coherence during the process of
HHG: as it is shown, different coherent superpositions of initial atomic states
produce observably different HHG spectra. For linearly polarized excitation, we
demonstrate that the question whether the constituents of the initial
superpositions are dipole coupled or not, strongly influences the dynamics. By
investigating time-dependent HHG signals, we also show that the preparation of
the initial atomic state can be used for the control of the high-harmonic
radiation.

actions. We assume that the game is symmetric and repeated infinitely many
times. At each stage players make their choices knowing only the average
payoffs from previous stages of all the players. A strategy of a player in the
repeated game is a function defined on the convex hull of the set of payoffs.
Our aim is to construct a strong Nash equilibrium in the repeated game, i.e. a
strategy profile being resistant to deviations by coalitions. Constructed
equilibrium strategies are safe, i.e. the non-deviating player payoff is not
smaller than the equilibrium payoff in the stage game, and deviating players'
payoffs do not exceed the non-deviating player payoff more than a positive
constant which can be arbitrary small and chosen by the non-deviating player.
Our construction is inspired by Smale's good strategies described in
\cite{smale}, where the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma was considered. In proofs
we use arguments based on approachability and strong approachability type
results.

  International Conference of. IEEE, 2017",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning from many real-world datasets is limited by a problem called the
class imbalance problem. A dataset is imbalanced when one class (the majority
class) has significantly more samples than the other class (the minority
class). Such datasets cause typical machine learning algorithms to perform
poorly on the classification task. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes
a new approach Neighbors Progressive Competition (NPC) for classification of
imbalanced datasets. Whilst the proposed algorithm is inspired by weighted
k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms, it has major differences from them.
Unlike k- NN, NPC does not limit its decision criteria to a preset number of
nearest neighbors. In contrast, NPC considers progressively more neighbors of
the query sample in its decision making until the sum of grades for one class
is much higher than the other classes. Furthermore, NPC uses a novel method for
grading the training samples to compensate for the imbalance issue. The grades
are calculated using both local and global information. In brief, the
contribution of this paper is an entirely new classifier for handling the
imbalance issue effectively without any manually-set parameters or any need for
expert knowledge. Experimental results compare the proposed approach with five
representative algorithms applied to fifteen imbalanced datasets and illustrate
this algorithms effectiveness.

2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation
period (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of
regime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between
different pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary
pulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine
wave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the
O-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1

previously was a coincidence due to various small effects that are carefully
analysed. Now, with a larger dataset, the presence of a planet is more
uncertain and would require confirmation with an independent method. The new
data allow us to improve the measurement of p_dot for f1 and f2: using only the

not limited to the following aspects: first, each agent does not have to know
as much as a complete row or column of the overall equation; second, each agent
only needs to control as few as two scalar states when the number of clusters
and the number of agents are sufficiently large; third, the dimensions of
agents' states in the proposed algorithms do not have to be the same (while in
contrast, algorithms based on the idea of standard consensus inherently require
all agents' states to be of the same dimension). Both analytical proof and
simulation results are provided to validate exponential convergence of the
proposed distributed algorithms in solving linear equations.

ingredient of next generation (5G) wireless networks. Effective communication
in mmWaves usually depends on the knowledge of the channel. We refer to the
problem of finding a narrow beam pair at the transmitter and at the receiver,
yielding high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as Beam Alignment (BA). Prior BA
schemes typically considered deterministic channels, where the instantaneous
channel coefficients are assumed to stay constant for a long time. In this
paper, in contrast, we propose a time-domain BA scheme for wideband mmWave
systems, where the channel is characterized by multi-path components, different
delays, Angle-of-Arrivals/Angle-of-Departures (AoAs/AoDs), and Doppler shifts.
In our proposed scheme, the Base Station (BS) probes the channel in the
downlink by some sequences with good autocorrelation property (e.g.,
Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequences), letting each user estimate its best AoA-AoD that
connects the user to the BS with two-sided high beamforming gain. We leverage
the sparse nature of mmWaves in the AoA-AoD-time domain, and formulate the BA
problem as a Compressed Sensing (CS) of a non-negative sparse vector. We use
the recently developed Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) technique to
efficiently find the strongest path connecting the BS and each user. Simulation
results show that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterpart in terms of
the training overhead and robustness to fast channel variations.

appropriately tune the network topology and its connectivity so as to support
the communication needs of those participating in the network. This paper
examines the problem of interference attacks that are intended to harm
connectivity and throughput, and illustrates the method of mapping network
performance parameters into the metric of topographic connectivity.
Specifically, this paper arrives at anti-jamming strategies aimed at coping
with interference attacks through a unified stochastic game. In such a
framework, an entity trying to protect a network faces a dilemma: (i) the
underlying motivations for the adversary can be quite varied, which depends
largely on the network's characteristics such as power and distance; (ii) the
metrics for such an attack can be incomparable (e.g., network connectivity and
total throughput). To deal with the problem of such incomparable metrics, this
paper proposes using the attack's expected duration as a unifying metric to
compare distinct attack metrics because a longer-duration of unsuccessful
attack assumes a higher cost. Based on this common metric, a mechanism of
maxmin selection for an attack prevention strategy is suggested.

where the DM particle, $S$, only has renormalizable interactions with the
Higgs, is non-operational due to strong constraints, specially from DM direct
detection limits. Thus we consider a most economical extension, called ESHP
(for extended SHP), which simply consists in the addition of a second (heavier)
scalar singlet in the dark sector. The second scalar can be integrated-out,
leaving a standard SHP plus a dimension-6 operator. Essentially, this model has
only two relevant parameters (the DM mass and the coupling of the dim-6
operator). DM annihilation occurs mainly into two Higgs bosons, $SS\rightarrow
hh$. We demonstrate that, despite its economy, the ESHP model provides
excellent fits to the GCE (with p-value $\sim 0.6-0.7$) for very reasonable
values of the parameters, in particular $m_S \simeq 130$ GeV. This is achieved
without conflicting with other observables and keeping the $S-$particle relic

processes on the plasma motion. We estimate the value ranges of plasma beta in
different regions within the solar atmosphere and we describe a possible
mechanism that helps forming a penumbra. For that we evaluate data from a 3D
magnetohydrodynamic model of the solar corona above a magnetically active
region. We compare our results with previously established data that is based
on magnetic field extrapolations and that was matched for some observations.
Our model data suggest that plasma beta in the photosphere should be considered
to be larger than unity outside of sunspots. However, in the corona we also
find that the beta value range reaches lower than previously thought, which
coincides with a recent observation. We present an idea based on a
gravity-driven process in a high-beta regime that might be responsible for the
formation of the penumbra around sunspot umbra, where the vertical field
strength reaches a given threshold. This process would also explain
counter-Evershed flows. Regarding the thermal and magnetic pressure within the
mixed-polarity solar atmosphere, including non-vertical magnetic field and
quiet regions, plasma beta may reach unity at practically any height from the

We show that networks generated by the BPPM follow an SBM in the limit of a
growing number of nodes. We use this property to develop principled and
efficient local search and variational inference procedures initialized by
regularized spectral clustering. We fit BPPMs with exponential Hawkes processes
to analyze several real network data sets, including a Facebook wall post
network with over 3,500 nodes and 130,000 events.

for higher-level processes to collect relevant low-level features from a region
of interest. Currently, max-pooling is one of the most commonly used operators
in the computational literature. However, it can lack robustness to outliers
due to the fact that it relies merely on the peak of a function. Pooling
mechanisms are also present in the primate visual cortex where neurons of
higher cortical areas pool signals from lower ones. The receptive fields of
these neurons have been shown to vary according to the contrast by aggregating
signals over a larger region in the presence of low contrast stimuli. We
hypothesise that this contrast-variant-pooling mechanism can address some of
the shortcomings of max-pooling. We modelled this contrast variation through a
histogram clipping in which the percentage of pooled signal is inversely
proportional to the local contrast of an image. We tested our hypothesis by
applying it to the phenomenon of colour constancy where a number of popular
algorithms utilise a max-pooling step (e.g. White-Patch, Grey-Edge and
Double-Opponency). For each of these methods, we investigated the consequences
of replacing their original max-pooling by the proposed
contrast-variant-pooling. Our experiments on three colour constancy benchmark
datasets suggest that previous results can significantly improve by adopting a
contrast-variant-pooling mechanism.

observed DM relic abundance and the observed DM to ordinary matter ratio can
emerge naturally. Dark matter freezes out before primordial nucleosynthesis and
does not significantly impact primordial abundances, so the conventional
argument that DM is non-baryonic does not apply. The interaction cross section
between DM and the gas in the Galaxy is such that the dark matter in our local
neighborhood is naturally co-rotating with the solar system, to a sufficient
degree that DM may not have enough energy to be detected in applicable DM
experiments. Interaction with the gas in galactic disks provides the first
(non-MONDian) explanation for the striking correlation in the small-scale
structure of rotation curves and the inhomogeneous distribution of gas, and
also accounts (unlike MOND) for instances of galaxies not exhibiting such
correlations. Depending on the cross-section, a DM-baryon interaction can
produce a dark matter disk as suggested by recent studies, and has many or all

against N-body results for four non-standard equations of state as well as
varying degrees of momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter. The
interaction is modelled phenomenologically using a time dependent drag term in
the Euler equation. We make comparisons at the level of the matter power
spectrum and the redshift space monopole and quadrupole. The multipoles are
modelled using the Taruya, Nishimichi and Saito (TNS) redshift space spectrum.
We find perturbation theory does very well in capturing non-linear effects
coming from dark sector interaction. We isolate and quantify the 1-loop
contribution coming from the interaction and from the non-standard equation of
state. We find the interaction parameter $\xi$ amplifies scale dependent
signatures in the range of scales considered. Non-standard equations of state
also give scale dependent signatures within this same regime. In redshift space
the match with N-body is improved at smaller scales by the addition of the TNS
free parameter $\sigma_v$. To quantify the importance of modelling the
interaction, we create mock data sets for varying values of $\xi$ using
perturbation theory. This data is given errors typical of Stage IV surveys. We
then perform a likelihood analysis using the first two multipoles on these sets
and a $\xi=0$ modelling, ignoring the interaction. We find the fiducial growth
parameter $f$ is generally recovered even for very large values of $\xi$ both
at $z=0.5$ and $z=1$. The $\xi=0$ modelling is most biased in its estimation of

motion is triggered by a Marangoni-like flow. This latter is generated by
variations of surfactant concentration which affect the droplet surface tension
promoting its motion. In the present paper a model for droplets with a third
amphiphilic component is adopted. The dynamics is described by Navier-Stokes
and convection-diffusion equations, solved by lattice Boltzmann method coupled
with finite-difference schemes. We focus on two cases. First the study of
self-propulsion of an isolated droplet is carried on and, then, the interaction
of two self-propelled droplets is investigated. In both cases, when the
surfactant migrates towards the interface, a quadrupolar vortex of the velocity
field forms inside the droplet and causes the motion. A weaker dipolar field
emerges instead when the surfactant is mainly diluted in the bulk. The dynamics
of two interacting droplets is more complex and strongly depends on their
reciprocal distance. If, in a head-on collision, droplets are close enough, the
velocity field initially attracts them until a motionless steady state is
achieved. If the droplets are vertically shifted, the hydrodynamic field leads
to an initial reciprocal attraction followed by a scattering along opposite

in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics subjects. One factor that
can contribute to the attrition is the lack of visible role models for women in
academia. At early career stages, the behaviour of the local community may play
a formative role in identifying ingroup role models, shaping women's
impressions of whether or not they can be successful in academia. One common
and formative setting to observe role models is the local departmental academic
seminar, talk, or presentation. We thus quantified women's visibility through
the question-asking behaviour of academics at seminars using observations and
an online survey. From the survey responses of over 600 academics in 20
countries, we found that women reported asking fewer questions after seminars
compared to men. This impression was supported by observational data from
almost 250 seminars in 10 countries: women audience members asked absolutely
and proportionally fewer questions than male audience members. When asked why
they did not ask questions when they wanted to, women, more than men, endorsed
internal factors (e.g., not working up the nerve). However, our observations
suggest that structural factors might also play a role; when a man was the
first to ask a question, or there were fewer questions, women asked
proportionally fewer questions. Attempts to counteract the latter effect by
manipulating the time for questions (in an effort to provoke more questions) in
two departments were unsuccessful. We propose alternative recommendations for
creating an environment that makes everyone feel more comfortable to ask
questions, thus promoting equal visibility for women and members of other less
visible groups.

$\gamma$-ray detector in space, has recently reported the new measurement of
the total electron plus positron flux between 25 GeV and 4.6 TeV. A spectral
softening at $\sim0.9$ TeV and a tentative peak at $\sim1.4$ TeV have been
reported. We study the physical implications of the DAMPE data in this work.
The presence of the spectral break significantly tightens the constraints on
the model parameters to explain the electron/positron excesses. The spectral
softening can either be explained by the maximum acceleration limits of
electrons by astrophysical sources, or a breakdown of the common assumption of
continuous distribution of electron sources at TeV energies in space and time.
The tentive peak at $\sim1.4$ TeV implies local sources of electrons/positrons
with quasi-monochromatic injection spectrum. We find that the cold,
ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ winds from pulsars may give rise to such a
structure. The pulsar is requird to be middle-aged, relatively slowly-rotated,
mildly magnetized, and isolated in a density cavity. The annihilation of DM
particles ($m_{\chi}\sim1.5$ TeV) into $e^+e^-$ pairs in a nearby clump or an
over-density region may also explain the data. In the DM scenario, the inferred
clump mass (or density enhancement) is about $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ (or $17-35$
times of the canonical local density) assuming a thermal production cross
section, which is relatively extreme compared with the expectation from
numerical simulations. A moderate enhancement of the annihilation cross section
via, e.g., the Sommerfeld mechanism or non-thermal production, is thus needed.

property of the auditory sensation. The interaction of two or more pitches
gives rise to a sensation that can be characterized by its degree of consonance
or dissonance. In the current study, we investigated the neuromagnetic
representations of consonant and dissonant musical dyads using a new model of
cortical activity, in an effort to assess the possible involvement of
pitch-specific neural mechanisms in consonance processing at early cortical
stages.
  In the first step of the study, we developed a novel model of cortical pitch
processing designed to explain the morphology of the pitch onset response
(POR), a pitch-specific subcomponent of the auditory evoked N100 component in
the human auditory cortex. The model explains the neural mechanisms underlying
the generation of the POR and quantitatively accounts for the relation between
its peak latency and the perceived pitch.
  Next, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the POR as elicited
by six consonant and dissonant dyads. The peak latency of the POR was strongly
modulated by the degree of consonance within the stimuli; specifically, the
most dissonant dyad exhibited a POR with a latency that was about 30ms longer
than that of the most consonant dyad, an effect that greatly exceeds the
expected latency difference induced by a single pitch sound.
  Our model was able to predict the POR latency pattern observed in the
neuromagnetic data, and to generalize this prediction to additional dyads.
These results indicate that the neural mechanisms responsible for pitch
processing exhibit an intrinsic differential response to concurrent consonant
and dissonant pitch combinations, suggesting that the perception of consonance
and dissonance might be an emergent property of the pitch processing system in
human auditory cortex.

estimates that have been constructed from stable limit cycles perturbed by

periodic autoregressive process to model the intersections of these orbits with
cross sections, then passing to the limit of a continuum of sections to obtain
a bound that depends on the continuous flow restricted to the (nontrivial)
Floquet mode. We compare our bound against the empirical variance of estimates
constructed using several cross sections. The section-based estimates are close
to being optimal. We posit that the utility of our bound persists in higher
dimensions when computed along Floquet modes for real and distinct multipliers.
Our bound elucidates some of the empirical observations noted in the
literature; e.g., (a) it is the number of cycles (as opposed to the frequency
of observations) that drives the variance of estimates to zero, and (b) the
estimator variance has a positive lower bound as the noise amplitude tends to
zero.

allowed to tackle problems that are larger by many orders of magnitudes.
However, as these linear scaling methods were developed for insulators, they
cannot, in general, be straightforwardly applied to metals, as a finite
temperature is needed to ensure locality of the density matrix. In this paper
we show that, once finite electronic temperature is employed, the linear
scaling version of the BigDFT code is able to exploit this locality to provide
a computational treatment that scales linearly with respect to the number of
atoms of a metallic system. We provide prototype examples based on bulk
Tungsten, which plays a key role in finding safe and long-lasting materials for

softening from $-3.1$ to $-3.9$. Such a feature is very similar to the knee at
the cosmic nuclei energy spectrum. In this work we propose that the knee-like
feature can be explained naturally by assuming that the electrons are
accelerated at the supernova remnants (SNRs) and released when the SNRs die out
with lifetime around $10^5$ years. The cut-off energy of those electrons have
already decreased to several TeV due to radiative cooling, which may induce the
observed TeV spectral break. Another possibility is that the break is induced
by a single nearby old SNR. Such a scenario may bring a large electron flux
anisotropy that is observable by the future detectors. We also show that a
minor part of electrons escaping during the acceleration in young and nearby
SNRs are able to contribute to several TeV or higher energy region of the
spectrum.

renormalization group method has proved to be one of the very robust
renormalization methods to study Kondo physics both in equilibrium as well as
in non-equilibrium. Here we have shown that this method can also be employed to
study local quantum criticality. We have calculated the flow equations for the
Kondo coupling and solved them for various values of the gap parameter and we
find that there is suppression of Kondo divergence as gap is increased which
signifies that as gap is increased, renormalization flow goes away from the

patients that can be used to analyze outcomes. Typically, studies on EMR data
have worked with established variables that have already been acknowledged to
be associated with certain outcomes. However, EMR data may also contain
hitherto unrecognized factors for risk association and prediction of outcomes
for a disease. In this paper, we present a scalable data-driven framework to
analyze EMR data corpus in a disease agnostic way that systematically uncovers
important factors influencing outcomes in patients, as supported by data and
without expert guidance. We validate the importance of such factors by using
the framework to predict for the relevant outcomes. Specifically, we analyze
EMR data covering approximately 47 million unique patients to characterize
renal failure (RF) among type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients. We propose a
specialized L1 regularized Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) survival model to
identify the important factors from those available from patient encounter
history. To validate the identified factors, we use a specialized generalized
linear model (GLM) to predict the probability of renal failure for individual
patients within a specified time window. Our experiments indicate that the
factors identified via our data-driven method overlap with the patient
characteristics recognized by experts. Our approach allows for scalable,
repeatable and efficient utilization of data available in EMRs, confirms prior

different models and their capability to generalise to different environments.
Therefore, this paper proposes a set of challenging simulated environments for
dialogue model development and evaluation. To provide some baselines, we
investigate a number of representative parametric algorithms, namely deep
reinforcement learning algorithms - DQN, A2C and Natural Actor-Critic and
compare them to a non-parametric model, GP-SARSA. Both the environments and
policy models are implemented using the publicly available PyDial toolkit and
released on-line, in order to establish a testbed framework for further
experiments and to facilitate experimental reproducibility.

the time-evolution operator: any unitary operator which is a function of the

implemented exactly, circumventing any Taylor or Trotter approximation errors.
The second technique is tailored to lattice models, and is targeted at reducing
the use of generic single-qubit rotations, which are very expensive to produce

single-qubit rotations used by our method scales with the number of parameters

conceptually similar to Gaussian embeddings. Interestingly, unlike the Gaussian
embeddings, we can also obtain context-specific densities: they encode
uncertainty about the sense of a word given its context and correspond to
posterior distributions within our model. The context-dependent densities have
many potential applications: for example, we show that they can be directly
used in the lexical substitution task. We describe an effective estimation
method based on the variational autoencoding framework. We also demonstrate
that our embeddings achieve competitive results on standard benchmarks.

freedom and complexity, amongst which we include biaxial (elliptical) symmetry,

the spatial extent of the region used for the analysis. For a circle of 11.5
parsecs around the cluster centre (the most homogeneous and complete region),
we find no compelling reason to abandon Kings model, although the Generalised
King model, introduced in this work, has slightly better fitting properties.
Furthermore, we find strong evidence against radially symmetric models when
compared to the elliptic extensions. Finally, we find that including mass
segregation in the form of luminosity segregation in the J band, is strongly
supported in all our models. Conclusions. We have put the question of the
projected spatial distribution of the Pleiades cluster on a solid probabilistic
framework, and inferred its properties using the most exhaustive and least
contaminated list of Pleiades candidate members available to date. Our results
suggest however that this sample may still lack about 20% of the expected

completeness and homogeneity of the data can be extended beyond the 11.5
parsecs limit. Such study will allow a more precise determination of the
Pleiades spatial distribution, its tidal radius, ellipticity, number of objects
and total mass.

dark-photon is an important benchmark for the emerging low-mass direct
detection program. Since this is one of the only predictive, detectable
freeze-in models, we investigate how robustly such testability extends to other
scenarios. For concreteness, we perform a detailed study of models in which DM
couples to a light scalar mediator and acquires a freeze-in abundance through
Higgs-mediator mixing. Unlike dark-photons, whose thermal properties weaken
stellar cooling bounds, the scalar coupling to Standard Model (SM) particles is
subject to strong astrophysical constraints, which severely limit the fraction
of DM that can be produced via freeze-in. While it seems naively possible to
compensate for this reduction by increasing the mediator-DM coupling,
sufficiently large values eventually thermalize the dark sector with itself and
yield efficient DM annihilation to mediators, which depletes the freeze-in
population; only a small window of DM candidate masses near the $\sim$ GeV
scale can accommodate the total observed abundance. Since many qualitatively
similar issues arise for other light mediators, we find it generically
difficult to realize a viable freeze-in scenario in which production arises
only from renormalizable interactions with SM particles. We also comment on
several model variations that may evade these conclusions.

between galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas-phase

mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at a fixed stellar mass are correlated with
galactic SFR. In this Letter, we quantify the timescale with which galactic
SFRs and metallicities evolve using hydrodynamical simulations. We find that
Illustris and IllustrisTNG predict that galaxy offsets from the star formation
main sequence and MZR evolve over similar timescales, are often anti-correlated
in their evolution, evolve with the halo dynamical time, and produce a
pronounced FMR. In fact, for a FMR to exist, the metallicity and SFR must
evolve in an anti-correlated sense which requires that they evolve with similar
time variability. In contrast to Illustris and IllustrisTNG, we speculate that
the SFR and metallicity evolution tracks may become decoupled in galaxy
formation models dominated by globally-bursty SFR histories, which could weaken
the FMR residual correlation strength. This opens the possibility of
discriminating between bursty and non-bursty feedback models based on the
strength and persistence of the FMR -- especially at high redshift.

discrepant both their underlying physical assumptions and their results. With
several detections and many upper limits for the gamma-ray fluxes of nearby
starforming galaxies now available, estimates that rely on empirical scalings
between gamma-ray and longer-wavelength luminosities have become possible and
increasingly popular. In this paper we examine factors that can bias such

dependence on the choice of star-formation tracer; c) uncertainties in the
slope and normalisation of empirical scalings. We find that such biases can be
significant, pointing towards the need for more sophisticated models for the
star-forming galaxy contribution to the gamma-ray background, implementing
more, and more confident, physics in their buildup. Finally, we show that there
are large regions of acceptable parameter space in observational inputs that
significantly overproduce the gamma-ray background, implying that the observed
level of the background can yield significant constraints on models of the

weak Rashba spin-orbit interactions. Diagonalizing the non-interacting
Hamiltonian leads to two separate bands, and by deriving an effective
low-energy interaction we find the mean field gap equations for the
superconducting order parameter on the bands. Solving the gap equations just
below the critical temperature, we find that superconductivity is caused by
Kohn-Luttinger type interaction, while the pairing symmetry of the bands are
indirectly affected by the spin-orbit coupling. The dominating attractive
momentum channel of the Kohn-Luttinger term depends on the filling fraction $n$
of the system, and it is therefore possible to change the momentum dependence
of the order parameter by tuning $n$. Moreover, $n$ also determines which band
has the highest critical temperature. Rotating the magnetic field changes the
momentum dependence from states that for small momenta reduce to a chiral $p_x
\pm i p_y$ type state for out-of-plane fields, to a nodal p-wave type state for
purely in-plane fields.

systems for exploring exotic states of matter. In this paper we investigate the
possibility of using experimentally tunable interactions in such systems to
mimic the physics of Majorana chains, currently a subject of intense research.
Crucially to our proposal, the interactions, which are local in space, appear
non-local in the synthetic dimension. We use this fact to induce coupling
between counter-propagating edge modes in the quantum Hall regime. For the case
of attractive interactions in a system composed of two tunneling-coupled
chains, we find a gapless quasi-topological phase with a doubly-degenerate
ground state. While the total number of particles in the system is kept fixed,
this phase is characterized by strong fluctuations of the pair number in each
chain. Each ground state is characterized by the parity of the total particle
number in each chain, similar to Majorana wires. However, in our system this
degeneracy persists for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary
conditions there is a small splitting of this degeneracy due to the
single-particle hopping at the edges. We show how subjecting the system to
additional synthetic flux or asymmetric potentials on the two chains can be
used to control this nonlocal qubit. We propose experimental probes for testing
the nonlocal nature of such a qubit and measuring its state.

the Tunka Valley, Siberia. It detects radio pulses in the 30-80 MHz band
produced during the air-shower development. As shown by Tunka-Rex, a sparse
radio array with about 200 m spacing is able to reconstruct the energy and the
depth of the shower maximum with satisfactory precision using simple methods
based on parameters of the lateral distribution of amplitudes. The LOFAR
experiment has shown that a sophisticated treatment of all individually
measured amplitudes of a dense antenna array can make the precision comparable
with the resolution of existing optical techniques. We develop these ideas
further and present a method based on the treatment of time series of measured
signals, i.e. each antenna station provides several points (trace) instead of a
single one (amplitude or power). We use the measured shower axis and energy as
input for CoREAS simulations: for each measured event we simulate a set of
air-showers with proton, helium, nitrogen and iron as primary particle (each
primary is simulated about ten times to cover fluctuations in the shower
maximum due to the first interaction). Simulated radio pulses are processed
with the Tunka-Rex detector response and convoluted with the measured signals.
A likelihood fit determines how well the simulated event fits to the measured
one. The positions of the shower maxima are defined from the distribution of
chi-square values of these fits. When using this improved method instead of the
standard one, firstly, the shower maximum of more events can be reconstructed,
secondly, the resolution is increased. The performance of the method is
demonstrated on the data acquired by the Tunka-Rex detector in 2012-2014.

  We present a novel divisive hierarchical clustering framework called
Hierarchical Stochastic Clustering (HSC), that acts in two stages. In the first
stage, it finds a primary hierarchy of clustering partitions in a dataset. In
the second stage, feeds a clustering algorithm with each one of the clusters of
the very detailed partition, in order to settle the final result. The output is
a hierarchy of clusters. Our method is based on the previous research of Meyer

in this work, dynamic thermomechanical material behavior of temperature

Counterintuitive storage modulus and loss factor dependent trends regarding the

increases with increasing photon number, but at the breakdown of thermal

the photons show strong inter-mode phase or number correlations despite the
absence of a direct nonlinearity. Experiments are well-matched to a detailed

In order to improve the error-correction performance of SC, two approaches are
available: (i) SC-List decoding which keeps a list of candidates by running a
number of SC decoders in parallel, thus increasing the implementation
complexity, and (ii) SC-Flip decoding that relies on a single SC module, and

partitioned SC-Flip (PSCF) decoding algorithm, which outperforms SC-Flip in

leading to higher throughput and reduced energy consumption per codeword. We
also introduce a partitioning scheme that best suits our PSCF decoder.
Simulation results show that at equivalent frame error rate, PSCF has up to $5
\times$ less computational complexity than the SC-Flip decoder. At equivalent
average number of iterations, the error-correction performance of PSCF
outperforms SC-Flip by up to $0.15$ dB at frame error rate of $10^{-3}$.

review board-approved single-center study, we analyzed DCE-MR images of 270
patients at our institution. Lesions of interest were identified by
radiologists. The task was to automatically determine whether the tumor is of
the Luminal A subtype or of another subtype based on the MR image patches
representing the tumor. Three different deep learning approaches were used to
classify the tumor according to their molecular subtypes: learning from scratch
where only tumor patches were used for training, transfer learning where
networks pre-trained on natural images were fine-tuned using tumor patches, and
off-the-shelf deep features where the features extracted by neural networks
trained on natural images were used for classification with a support vector
machine. Network architectures utilized in our experiments were GoogleNet, VGG,
and CIFAR. We used 10-fold crossvalidation method for validation and area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) as the measure of performance.
Results: The best AUC performance for distinguishing molecular subtypes was
0.65 (95% CI:[0.57,0.71]) and was achieved by the off-the-shelf deep features
approach. The highest AUC performance for training from scratch was 0.58 (95%
CI:[0.51,0.64]) and the best AUC performance for transfer learning was 0.60

extracted from the fully connected layer performed the best. Conclusion: Deep
learning may play a role in discovering radiogenomic associations in breast
cancer.

power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the
same voltage level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world
networks, including low local clustering, large diameter, and large average

model is to match both these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding
in two phases: the first phase adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking
desired vertex degrees and desired diameter as inputs, while the second phase
of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation process. We
test the model's performance by comparing its output across many runs to the
aforementioned real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is
more accurate in reproducing the unusual mixture of properties apparent in the

a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency, and guidelines for artificially

applications of mixture models for cluster analysis, classification, and
semi-parametric density estimation. We present several classification examples
from the literature, including identification of a new class, analysis of
contaminants, and overlapping populations. In most cases, mixtures of normal
(Gaussian) distributions are used, but it is sometimes necessary to use
different distribution functions derived from astrophysical experience. We also
address the use of mixture models for the analysis of spatial distributions of
objects, like galaxies in redshift surveys or young stars in star-forming
regions. In the case of galaxy clustering, mixture models may not be the
optimal choice for understanding the homogeneous and isotropic structure of
voids and filaments. However, we show that mixture models, using astrophysical
models for star clusters, may provide a natural solution to the problem of
subdividing a young stellar population into subclusters. Finally, we explore
how mixture models can be used for mathematically advanced modeling of data
with heteroscedastic uncertainties or missing values, providing two example
algorithms, the measurement error regression model of Kelly (2007) and the
Extreme Deconvolution model of Bovy et al. (2011). The challenges presented by

non-distributed nuclear burning fronts as a possible solution to a fundamental
problem for the thermonuclear explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{Ch}$)
white dwarf (WD), the currently favored scenario for the majority of Type Ia
SNe (SNe~Ia). All existing 3D hydrodynamical simulations predict strong global
mixing of the burning products due to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, which
is in contradiction with observations. As a first step and to study the flame
physics we present a set of computational magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models in
rectangular flux tubes, resembling a small inner region of a WD. We consider
initial magnetic fields up to $10^{12}\,\,\mathrm{G}$ of various orientations.
We find an increasing suppression of RT instabilities starting at about
$10^9\,\,\mathrm{G}$. The front speed tends to decrease with increasing
magnitude up to about $10^{11}\,\,\mathrm{G}$. For even higher fields new small
scale finger-like structures develop, which increase the burning speed by a
factor of 3 to 4 above the field-free RT-dominated regime. We suggest that the

the vanishing type and the strong space charge (SSC) type. For the former, the
threshold value of the wake tune shift is asymptotically proportional to the SC
tune shift, as it was first observed twenty years ago by M. Blaskiewicz for

Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations to study the morphology of the inner 0.3 pc
$\times$ 0.2 pc region surrounding the central binary that appears to be a
relic of a more recent outburst of the progenitor AGB star. We applied
diagnostic diagrams based on emission line ratios of H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563,
[O III] $\lambda$5007, and [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6717,6731 images to identify
the location and morphology of low-ionization structures within the inner

gas, within a radius of 55 arcsec ($\sim$ 0.15 pc) extending from the central
star: a large envelope expanding toward the northeast, and its smaller
counterpart envelope in the opposite direction toward the southwest of the
nebula. These low-ionization envelopes are surrounded by a highly-ionized
gaseous environment. We believe that these low-ionization expanding envelopes
are a result of a powerful outburst from the post-AGB star that created shocked
wind regions as they propagate through the previously expelled material along a
symmetric axis. Our diagnostic mapping using high-angular resolution line
emission imaging can provide a novel approach to detection of low-ionization
regions in other PNe, especially those showing a complex multi-scale

rigid dipole model, where the magnetization of each particle in a fluid is
supposed to be firmly fixed in the crystal lattice. Equations of motion,
employing the Newton's second law for rotational motion, the condition of rigid
body rotation, and the assumption that the friction torque is proportional to
angular velocity, are used. This oversimplification permits us to expand the
model easily: to take into account the thermal noise and inter-particle
interaction that allows to estimate from unified positions the role of thermal
activation and dipole interaction in the heating process. Our studies are
conducted in three stages. The exact expressions for the average power loss of
a single particle are obtained within the dynamical approximation. Then, in the
stochastic case, the power loss of a single particle is estimated analytically
using the Fokker-Planck equation and numerically using the effective Langevin
equation. Finally, the power loss for the particle ensemble is obtained using
the molecular dynamics method. Here, the local dipole fields are calculated
approximately based on the Barnes-Hut algorithm. The revealed trends in the
behaviour of both a single particle and the particle ensemble suggest the way
of choosing the conditions for obtaining the maximum heating efficiency. The
competitiveness character of the inter-particle interaction and thermal noise
is investigated in details. Two situations, when the thermal noise rectifies
the power loss reduction caused by the interaction, are described. The first of
them is related to the complete destruction of dense clusters at high noise
intensity. The second one is originated from the rare switching of the
particles in clusters due to thermal activation, when the noise intensity is
relatively weak.

  Optimal Policy, Performance Analysis and Implications on Road Traffic","accepted by Internet of Things Journal",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In vehicular cloud computing (VCC) systems, the computational resources of
moving vehicles are exploited and managed by infrastructures, e.g., roadside
units, to provide computational services. The offloading of computational tasks
and collection of results rely on successful transmissions between vehicles and
infrastructures during encounters. In this paper, we investigate how to provide
timely computational services in VCC systems. In particular, we seek to
minimize the deadline violation probability given a set of tasks to be executed
in vehicular clouds. Due to the uncertainty of vehicle movements, the task
replication methodology is leveraged which allows one task to be executed by
several vehicles, and thus trading computational resources for delay reduction.
The optimal task replication policy is of key interest. We first formulate the
problem as a finite-horizon sampled-time Markov decision problem and obtain the
optimal policy by value iterations. To conquer the complexity issue, we propose
the balanced-task-assignment (BETA) policy which is proved optimal and has a
clear structure: it always assigns the task with the minimum number of
replicas. Moreover, a tight closed-form performance upper bound for the BETA
policy is derived, which indicates that the deadline violation probability
follows the Rayleigh distribution approximately. Applying the vehicle
speed-density relationship in the traffic flow theory, we find that vehicle
mobility benefits VCC systems more compared with road traffic systems, by
showing that the optimum vehicle speed to minimize the deadline violation
probability is larger than the critical vehicle speed in traffic theory which
maximizes traffic flow efficiency.

The signal that a
vertex $v$ receives from a tower of signal strength $t$ located at vertex $T$
is defined as $sig(v,T)=max(t-dist(v,T),0)$, where $dist(v,T)$ denotes the
distance between the vertices $v$ and $T$. In 2015 Blessing, Insko, Johnson,
and Mauretour defined a $(t,r)$ broadcast dominating set, or simply a $(t,r)$
broadcast, on $G$ as a set $\mathbb{T}\subseteq V$ such that the sum of all
signal received at each vertex $v \in V$ is at least $r$. We say that
$\mathbb{T}$ is optimal if $|\mathbb{T}|$ is minimal among all such sets
$\mathbb{T}$. The cardinality of an optimal $(t,r)$ broadcast on a finite graph
$G$ is called the $(t,r)$ broadcast domination number of $G$. The concept of
$(t,r)$ broadcast domination generalizes the classical problem of domination on
graphs. In fact, the $(2,1)$ broadcasts on a graph $G$ are exactly the
dominating sets of $G$.
  In their paper, Blessing et al. considered
$(t,r)\in\{(2,2),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)\}$ and gave optimal $(t,r)$ broadcasts on
$G_{m,n}$, the grid graph of dimension $m\times n$, for small values of $m$ and
$n$. They also provided upper bounds on the optimal $(t,r)$ broadcast numbers
for grid graphs of arbitrary dimensions. In this paper, we define the density
of a $(t,r)$ broadcast, which allows us to provide optimal $(t,r)$ broadcasts
on the infinite grid graph for all $t\geq2$ and $r=1,2$, and bound the density
of the optimal $(t,3)$ broadcast for all $t\geq2$. In addition, we give a
family of counterexamples to the conjecture of Blessing et al. that the optimal
$(t,r)$ and $(t+1, r+2)$ broadcasts are identical for all $t\geq1$ and $r\geq1$

sparsity at the user level. In this paper, we propose a novel
mutual-enhancement framework to simultaneously partition and learn latent
activity profiles of users. We propose a flexible user partitioning approach to
effectively discover rare behaviors and tackle user-level sparsity. We
extensively evaluate the proposed framework on massive datasets from real-world
platforms including Q&A networks and interactive online courses (MOOCs). Our
results indicate significant gains over state-of-the-art behavior models ( 15%
avg ) in a varied range of tasks and our gains are further magnified for users
with limited interaction data. The proposed algorithms are amenable to
parallelization, scale linearly in the size of datasets, and provide
flexibility to model diverse facets of user behavior.

four solar cycles (1976--2015). We show that the ionospheric F$_1$ and F$_2$

the same time with the large SG numbers, especially during the solar cycle 23.
The observed differences in the sensitivity of ionospheric critical frequencies
to sunspot group (SG) numbers provide a new insight into the solar activity
effects on the ionosphere and space weather. While the F$_1$ layer is
influenced by the slow solar wind, which is largely associated with small SGs,
the ionospheric F$_2$ layer is more sensitive to Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
and fast solar winds, which are mainly produced by large SGs and coronal holes.
The SG numbers maximize during of peak of the solar cycle and the number of
coronal holes peaks during the sunspot declining phase. During solar minimum
there are relatively less large SGs, hence reduced CME and flare activity.
These results provide a new perspective for assessing how the different regions

existence. As such, they require patches that are correct and quickly deployed.
This motivates an automatic patch generation method that emphasizes both
soundness and wide applicability. To address this challenge, we propose Senx,
which uses three novel patch generation techniques to create patches for
out-of-bounds read/write vulnerabilities. Senx uses symbolic execution to
extract expressions from the source code of a target application to synthesize
patches. To reduce the runtime overhead of patches, it uses loop cloning and
access range analysis to analyze loops involved in these vulnerabilities and
elevate patches outside of loops. For vulnerabilities that span multiple
functions, Senx uses expression translation to translate expressions and place
them in a function scope where all values are available to create the patch.
This enables Senx to patch vulnerabilities with complex loops and
interprocedural dependencies that previous semantics-based patch generation
systems cannot handle.
  We have implemented a prototype using this approach. Our evaluation shows
that the patches generated by Senx successfully fix 76% of 42 real-world
vulnerabilities from 11 applications including various tools or libraries for
manipulating graphics/media files, a programming language interpreter, a
relational database engine, a collection of programming tools for creating and
managing binary programs, and a collection of basic file, shell, and text
manipulation tools. All patches that Senx produces are sound, and Senx
correctly aborts patch generations in cases where its analysis will fall short.

In the current study, static pressure loss and sound generation measured in the

dominant frequency was found to be around 1840-1870 Hz for flow rates of

and disease depends on accurate signal characterization and feature extraction.
One approach of determining signal features is to estimate its time-frequency
characteristics. In this regard, four different time-frequency distribution
(TFD) approaches were used including short-time Fourier transform (STFT),
polynomial chirplet transform (PCT), Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), and
smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD). Synthetic SCG signals with
known time-frequency properties were generated and used to evaluate the
accuracy of the different TFDs in extracting SCG spectral characteristics.
Using different TFDs, the instantaneous frequency (IF) of each synthetic signal
was determined and the error (NRMSE) in estimating IF was calculated. STFT had
lower NRMSE than WVD for synthetic signals considered. PCT and SPWVD were,
however, more accurate IF estimators especially for the signal with
time-varying frequencies. PCT and SPWVD also provided better discrimination
between signal frequency components. Therefore, the results of this study
suggest that PCT and SPWVD would be more reliable methods for estimating IF of
SCG signals. Analysis of actual SCG signals showed that these signals had
multiple spectral components with slightly time-varying frequencies. More
studies are needed to investigate SCG spectral properties for healthy subjects
as well as patients with different cardiac conditions.

some cardiac pathologies may affect SCG morphology. In this study, the effect
of the respiration on the SCG signal morphology is investigated. SCG, ECG, and
respiratory flow rate signals were measured simultaneously in 7 healthy
subjects. Results showed that SCG events tended to have two slightly different
morphologies. The respiratory flow rate and lung volume information were used
to group the SCG events into inspiratory/expiratory groups or low/high
lung-volume groups, respectively. Although respiratory flow information could
separate similar SCG events into two different groups, the lung volume
information provided better grouping of similar SCGs. This suggests that
variations in SCG morphology may be due, at least in part, to changes in the
intrathoracic pressure or heart location since those parameters correlates more
with lung volume than respiratory flow. Categorizing SCG events into different
groups containing similar events allows more accurate estimation of SCG
features, and better signal characterization, and classification.

moderate polarized intensity. Magnetic field vectors indicate a tangential
magnetic field, expected for an evolved SNR, in one part of the SNR and a
radial magnetic field in the other. The latter can be explained by an
overlapping arc-like feature, perhaps a pulsar wind nebula, emanating from the
magnetar. The presence of a pulsar wind nebula is supported by the low average
braking index of 1.2, we extrapolated for the magnetar, and the detection of
diffuse X-ray emission around it. We found a distance of 12.5 kpc for the SNR,
which identifies G57.2+0.8 as a resident of the Outer spiral arm of the Milky

from the bottom of the conduction band to lower energy gapless states in the

structural transformation involves dissociation of Mo-Te bonds (one per formula
unit), which results in a kinetic energy barrier of 0.83 eV. The transformation
involves a consecutive movement of atoms similar to a domain wall motion. The
presence of excess charge carriers modifies not only the total energy of the
initial and final states, but also lowers an energy of the transition state. An
experimentally observed hysteresis in the switching process can be attributed
to changes in the kinetic energy barrier due to its dependence on the excess
carrier density.

videos. In this study, we introduce a novel compact motion representation for
video action recognition, named Optical Flow guided Feature (OFF), which
enables the network to distill temporal information through a fast and robust
approach. The OFF is derived from the definition of optical flow and is
orthogonal to the optical flow. The derivation also provides theoretical
support for using the difference between two frames. By directly calculating
pixel-wise spatiotemporal gradients of the deep feature maps, the OFF could be
embedded in any existing CNN based video action recognition framework with only
a slight additional cost. It enables the CNN to extract spatiotemporal
information, especially the temporal information between frames simultaneously.
This simple but powerful idea is validated by experimental results. The network
with OFF fed only by RGB inputs achieves a competitive accuracy of 93.3% on
UCF-101, which is comparable with the result obtained by two streams (RGB and
optical flow), but is 15 times faster in speed. Experimental results also show
that OFF is complementary to other motion modalities such as optical flow. When
the proposed method is plugged into the state-of-the-art video action
recognition framework, it has 96:0% and 74:2% accuracy on UCF-101 and HMDB-51

understand the implications that a dysfunctional leaflet has on the blood flow

suggested that leaflet dysfunction caused increased local velocities,

increased from 2.53 m/s to 4.9 m/s when dysfunction increased from 0% to 100%.
The pressure drop increased (by up to 300%) with dysfunctionality. Results
suggested that leaflet dysfunction also caused increased wall shear stresses on
the valve frame where higher stresses developed around the hinges (at 75% and
100% dysfunctions). Analysis also showed that increased dysfunctionality of one

by gradually growing a ball around the nominal safe action. One can apply any
exploration strategy where actions are chosen from such safe regions.
Experiments on a stylized model of data center cooling dynamics show how
computing proper safe regions can increase the sample efficiency of safe

interfacing of WS2 and MoS2 layered materials in combination with other
families of 2D materials were previously reported. On the other hand, lateral
heterostructures are particularly promising for the spatial confinement of
charged carriers, excitons and phonons within an atomically-thin layer. In the
lateral geometry, the quality of the interface in terms of the crystallinity
and optical properties is of paramount importance. Using plasmonic near-field
tip-enhanced technology, we investigated the detailed nanoscale
photoluminescence (nano-PL) characteristics of the hetero-interface in a
monolayer WS2-MoS2 lateral heterostructure. Focusing the laser excitation spot
at the apex of a plasmonic tip improved the PL spatial resolution by an order
of magnitude compared to the conventional far-field PL. Nano-PL spatial line
profiles were found to be more pronounced and enhanced at the interfaces. By
analyzing the spectral signals of the heterojunctions, we obtained a better
understanding of these direct band gap layered semiconductors, which may help
to design next-generation smart optoelectronic devices.

covering all fermion operators of the nonminimal Standard-Model Extension

SME. First of all, a suitable Ansatz is made for the Lagrangian of the
spin-degenerate operators $\hat{a}$, $\hat{c}$, $\hat{e}$, and $\hat{f}$ at
leading order in Lorentz violation. The latter is shown to satisfy the set of
five nonlinear equations that govern the map from the field theory to the
classical description. After doing so, the second step is to propose results
for the spin-nondegenerate operators $\hat{b}$, $\hat{d}$, $\hat{H}$, and
$\hat{g}$. Although these are more involved than the Lagrangians for the
spin-degenerate ones, an analytical proof of their validity is viable,
nevertheless. The final step is to combine both findings to produce a generic
Lagrangian for the complete set of Lorentz-violating operators that is
consistent with the known minimal and nonminimal Lagrangians found in the
literature so far. The outcome reveals the leading-order structure of the
classical SME analog. It can be of use for both phenomenological studies of

Floquet dynamics. Here we propose a new type of Floquet physics for a

shaken lattice induces Floquet quasi-energy bands for the BEC, whose back

for the shaken lattice. Such self-adapted Floquet dynamics show two surprising

possesses a hysteresis even without atom interactions; \textit{ii}) the
dynamical atom-cavity steady state could exist at free energy maxima. The atom
interactions strongly affect the phase transition of the BEC from zero to

However, it is not clear a priori that such a switching strategy still yields
consensus in this switched system, in the normal (un-attacked) operation mode.

linear systems with unstable subsystems, we characterize sufficient conditions
for the dwell time of topology-switching signal to reach consensus. Building on

a simplified control protocol, achieves consensus while providing substantial
advantages over other control approaches: it relies only on the relative

in experiments and are expected to exhibit intriguing transport properties such
as the emergence of superconductivity and Dirac Fermions. However, quantitative
understanding of intrinsic electrical transport of borophene has not been
achieved. Here, we report a comprehensive first-principles study on
electron-phonon driven intrinsic electrical resistivity (\r{ho}) of emerging
borophene structures. We find that the resistivity is highly dependent on the
atomic structures and electron density of borophene. Low-temperature
resistivity of borophene \r{ho} exhibits a universal scaling behavior, which
increases rapidly with temperature T (\r{ho}~T^4), while \r{ho} increases
linearly for a large temperature window T > 100 K. It is observed that this
universal behavior of intrinsic resistivity is well described by
Bloch-Gr\""unesisen model. Different from graphene and conventional
three-dimensional metals, the intrinsic resistivity of borophenes can be easily
tuned by adjusting carrier densities while the Bloch-Gr\""unesisen temperature
is nearly fixed at ~100 K. Our work suggests monolayer boron can serve as an
intriguing platform for realizing high-tunable two-dimensional electronic
devices.

Existing methods assume that words in responses are generated from an identical

We propose a dynamic vocabulary sequence-to-sequence (DVS2S) model which allows
each input to possess their own vocabulary in decoding. In training, vocabulary
construction and response generation are jointly learned by maximizing a lower

the model dynamically allocates a small vocabulary for an input with the word

of the dynamic vocabulary mechanism, DVS2S eludes many generic patterns and
irrelevant words in generation, and enjoys efficient decoding at the same time.
Experimental results on both automatic metrics and human annotations show that
DVS2S can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of

bands. The amplitude of the observed variability is found to decrease from high
energy to low energy (X-ray to optical) bands. Count-count plots of
ultraviolet/optical bands with hard X-rays clearly suggest the presence of a
mixture of two major components: (i) highly variable component such as hard
X-ray emission and (ii) slowly varying disc-like component. The variations
observed in the ultraviolet/optical emission are strongly correlated with the
hard X-ray band. Cross-correlation analysis provides the lags for the longer
wavelengths compared to the hard X-rays. Such lags clearly suggest that the
changes in the ultraviolet/optical bands follow the variations in the hard
X-ray band. This implies the observed variation in longer wavelengths is due to
X-ray reprocessing. Though, the measured lag spectrum (lag vs. wavelength) is
well described by {\lambda}^(4/3) as expected from the standard disc model, the
observed lags are found to be longer than the predicted values from standard
disc model. This implies that the actual size of the disc of NGC 4593 is larger

there are two index morphisms, one related to ellipticity and a second one
related to fully ellipticity. For the first one, we are able to extend to this

that a $b$-longitudinal elliptic operator can be perturbed (up stable homotopy
within elliptic operators) with a regularizing operator in the calculus to get
a fully elliptic operator if and only if a certain boundary topological index

construct a topological index and prove the equality with the analytic-Fredholm
index, and use it to get a cohomological index formula for every fully elliptic

we can compare our formula with the one by Melrose-Piazza to get a new

triple nodal points in the absence of spin orbital coupling (SOC). By taking
into account of SOC, each triple nodal point splits into two Weyl points, which
are located on the magnetic axis with four-fold rotational symmetry. Notably,

to transmit an arbitrary memoryless source over an arbitrary additive channel.
We propose a mismatched coding architecture that consists of Gaussian codebooks
for both the source reproduction sequences and channel codewords. The natural
nearest neighbor encoder and decoder, however, need to be judiciously modified
to obtain the highest communication rates at finite blocklength. In particular,
we consider a unequal error protection (UEP) scheme in which all sources are
partitioned into disjoint power type classes. We also regularize the nearest
neighbor decoder so that an appropriate measure of the size of each power type
class is taken into account in the decoding strategy. For such an architecture,
we derive ensemble-tight second-order and moderate deviations results. Our
first-order (optimal bandwidth expansion ratio) result generalizes the seminal
results by Lapidoth (1996, 1997). The dispersion of our JSCC scheme is a linear
combination of the mismatched dispersions for the channel coding saddle-point
problem by Scarlett, Tan and Durisi (2017) and the rate-distortion saddle-point
problem by the present authors, thus also generalizing these results.

acceleration theory favors turbulent field environs in the proximity of these
shocks, turbulence driven by current instabilities involving energetic ions.
With the imminent prospect of dedicated X-ray polarimeters becoming a reality,
the possibility looms of probing turbulence on scales that couple to the
super-TeV electrons that emit X-rays. This paper presents model X-ray
polarization signatures from energetic electrons moving in simulated MHD
turbulence of varying levels of ""chaos."" The emission volumes are finite slabs
that represent the active regions of young SNR shells. We find that the
turbulent field energy must be quite limited relative to that of the total

the fermion particle representation of the spin chain. In the first case we
discover a remarkable sensitivity of $\sigma'(\omega)$ to the sign of $J_2$,

effectively non-interacting (fermions hopping on odd and even sublattices) and

of caches: a dynamic cache, which stores words from the best translation
hypotheses of preceding sentences, and a topic cache, which maintains a set of

associated with the translation invariance of the model and the existence of a
continuous family of solutions with varying wave speed. These point spectrum
results, in conjunction with previous results in the literature, imply that in
these cases the travelling wave solutions are absolute unstable if the
chemotactic coefficient is above a certain critical value, while they are
transiently unstable otherwise.

current research. Combining such an embedding model with logic rules has
recently attracted increasing attention. Most previous attempts made a one-time
injection of logic rules, ignoring the interactive nature between embedding
learning and logical inference. And they focused only on hard rules, which
always hold with no exception and usually require extensive manual effort to
create or validate. In this paper, we propose Rule-Guided Embedding (RUGE), a
novel paradigm of KG embedding with iterative guidance from soft rules. RUGE
enables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from 1) labeled triples that
have been directly observed in a given KG, 2) unlabeled triples whose labels
are going to be predicted iteratively, and 3) soft rules with various
confidence levels extracted automatically from the KG. In the learning process,
RUGE iteratively queries rules to obtain soft labels for unlabeled triples, and
integrates such newly labeled triples to update the embedding model. Through
this iterative procedure, knowledge embodied in logic rules may be better
transferred into the learned embeddings. We evaluate RUGE in link prediction on
Freebase and YAGO. Experimental results show that: 1) with rule knowledge
injected iteratively, RUGE achieves significant and consistent improvements
over state-of-the-art baselines; and 2) despite their uncertainties,
automatically extracted soft rules are highly beneficial to KG embedding, even
those with moderate confidence levels. The code and data used for this paper
can be obtained from https://github.com/iieir-km/RUGE.

nearest-neighbor $XXZ$ interactions with anisotropy ratio $\Delta$ and
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions with strength $D$. In the classical limit
where the spin $S$ at each site is very large, we find a rich phase diagram of
the ground state as a function of $\Delta$ and $D$. There are five distinct
phases which correspond to different ground state spin configurations in the
classical limit. We use spin wave theory to find the bulk energy bands of the
magnons in some of these phases. We also study a strip of the system which has
infinite length and finite width; we find modes which are localized on one of
the edges of the strip with energies which lie in the gaps of the bulk modes.
In the ferromagnetic phase in which all the spins point along the $+ \hat z$ or
$- \hat z$ direction, the bulk bands are separated from each other by finite
energy gaps. This makes it possible to calculate the Berry curvature at all
momenta, and hence the Chern numbers for every band; the number of edge states
is related to the Chern numbers. Interestingly, we find that there are four
different regions in this phase where the Chern numbers are different. Hence
there are four distinct topological phases even though the ground state spin
configuration is identical in all these phases. We calculate the thermal Hall
conductivity of the magnons as a function of the temperature in the above
ferromagnetic phase; we find that this can distinguish between the various
topological phases. These results are valid for all values of $S$.In the other
phases, there are no gaps between the different bands; hence the edge states
are not topologically protected.

For realistic applications, the ideal is to modify the bandgap in a controlled

Here, we report the observation of a universally tunable bandgap in the family
of bulk 2H transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by in situ surface doping of
Rb atoms. A series of angle-resolved photoemission spectra unexceptionally
shows that the bandgap of TMDs at the zone corners is modulated in the range of
0.8 ~ 2.0 eV, which covers a wide spectral range from visible to near infrared,
with a tendency from indirect to direct bandgap. A key clue to understand the
mechanism of this bandgap engineering is provided by the spectroscopic
signature of symmetry breaking and resultant spin splitting, which can be
explained by the formation of 2D electric dipole layers within the surface
bilayer of TMDs. Our results establish the surface Stark effect as a universal
mechanism of bandgap engineering based on the strong 2D nature of van-der-Waals
semiconductors.

factors, making the quantification of health effects associated with

sufficiently protective of human health. The quantification of the effects of
exposure to an environmental mixture poses several statistical challenges. It
is often the case that exposure to multiple pollutants interact with each other
to affect an outcome. Further, the exposure-response relationship between an
outcome and some exposures, such as some metals, can exhibit complex, nonlinear
forms, since some exposures can be beneficial and detrimental at different
ranges of exposure. To estimate the health effects of complex mixtures we
propose a flexible Bayesian approach that allows exposures to interact with
each other and have nonlinear relationships with the outcome. We induce
sparsity using multivariate spike and slab priors to determine which exposures
are associated with the outcome, and which exposures interact with each other.
The proposed approach is interpretable, as we can use the posterior
probabilities of inclusion into the model to identify pollutants that interact
with each other. We illustrate our approach's ability to estimate complex

determine which environmental pollutants adversely affect health.

difficulty of implementing non-linear activation functions, which is essential
for classical neurons, due to the linear nature of quantum mechanics. Here we
propose a solution to this roadblock in the form of a small quantum circuit
that naturally simulates neurons with threshold activation. Our quantum circuit
defines a building block, the ""quantum neuron"", that can reproduce a variety of
classical neural network constructions while maintaining the ability to process
superpositions of inputs and preserve quantum coherence and entanglement. In
the construction of feedforward networks of quantum neurons, we provide
numerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function when trained
with superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this
training suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately.
When arranged to mimic Hopfield networks, quantum neural networks exhibit
properties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded using the simple Hebbian
rule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted
inputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional)

on top of cluster structure, the data also contains a subset of
\emph{unstructured} points. Our goal is to detect the clusters despite the
presence of many unstructured points. Any algorithm that achieves this goal is
noise-robust. We consider a regularisation method which converts any
center-based clustering objective into a noise-robust one. We focus on the
$k$-means objective and we prove that the regularised version of $k$-means is
NP-Hard even for $k=1$. We consider two algorithms based on the convex (sdp and
lp) relaxation of the regularised objective and prove robustness guarantees for
both.
  The sdp and lp relaxation of the standard (non-regularised) $k$-means
objective has been previously studied by [ABC+15]. Under the stochastic ball
model of the data they show that the sdp-based algorithm recovers the
underlying structure as long as the balls are separated by $\delta > 2\sqrt{2}
+ \epsilon$. We improve upon this result in two ways. First, we show recovery
even for $\delta > 2 + \epsilon$. Second, our regularised algorithm recovers
the balls even in the presence of noise so long as the number of noisy points
is not too large. We complement our theoretical analysis with simulations and
analyse the effect of various parameters like regularization constant,
noise-level etc. on the performance of our algorithm. In the presence of noise,
our algorithm performs better than $k$-means++ on MNIST.

different Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) materials, having different d33 values,

governs the amount of force available from the system. A comparison of
piezoelectric stiffness for the case of a nanoscale site contact region,

stiffness is well below the cantilever stiffness, limiting and diminishing the

gapless nature of the observed density of states depends on the existence of

elucidating a basic element underlying this universal behavior. Similarly to
jammed particulate packings, low-frequency modes in structural glasses emerge
from a balance between a local elasticity term and an internal stress term in
the dynamical matrix, where the difference between them is orders of magnitude
smaller than their typical magnitude. By artificially reducing the magnitude of
internal stresses in a computer glass former in three dimensions, we show that
a gap is formed in the density of states below which no vibrational modes
exist, thus demonstrating the crucial importance of internal stresses. Finally,
we show that while better annealing the glass upon cooling from the liquid

processes during cooling render the gapless $D(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$ density

\textit{Kepler} ETVs. KIC 6048106 is an Algol-type binary with F5-K5
components, a near-circular orbit and a 1.56-d period undergoing variations of
the order of $\frac{\Delta P}{P}\simeq 3.60\times10^{-7}$ in $287\pm7$ days.
The primary component is a main-sequence star with
$M_{1}=1.55\pm0.11M_{\odot}$,~$R_{1}=1.57\pm0.12R_{\odot}$. The secondary is a
much cooler subgiant with $M_{2}=0.33\pm0.07M_{\odot}$,~$R_{2}=1.77
\pm0.16R_{\odot}$. Many small near-polar spots are active on its surface. The
second quadrature phase shows a brightness modulation on a time scale $290\pm7$
days, in good agreement with the ETV modulation. This study reveals a stable
binary configuration along with clear evidence of a long-term activity of the
secondary star.

enhance the distinction between nodes along object boundaries and the
similarity among object regions, a graph is constructed by introducing the
concept of virtual node. To remove incorrect outputs, a scheme for selecting
background seeds and a method for generating compactness foreground regions are
introduced, respectively. Different from prior methods, we calculate the
saliency value of each node based on the relationship between the corresponding
node and the virtual node. In order to achieve significant performance
improvement consistently, we propose an Extended Manifold Ranking (EMR)

rotating ellipsoidal fluid masses. The latter are the simplest models of fluid
celestial bodies with internal rotation and subjected to tidal forces. The
classical problem is the stability of Roche--Riemann ellipsoids moving on
circular Kepler orbits. However, previous stability studies have to be
reassessed. Indeed, they only consider global perturbations of large wavelength
or local perturbations of short wavelength. Moreover many planets and stars
undergo orbital motions on eccentric Kepler orbits, implying time-dependent
ellipsoidal semi-axes. This time dependence has never been taken into account
in hydrodynamic stability studies. In this work we overcome these stringent
assumptions. We extend the hydrodynamic stability analysis of rotating
ellipsoids to the case of eccentric orbits. We have developed two open-source
and versatile numerical codes to perform global and local inviscid stability
analyses. They give sufficient conditions for instability. The global method,
based on an exact and closed Galerkin basis, handles rigorously global
ellipsoidal perturbations of unprecedented complexity. Tidally driven and
libration-driven elliptical instabilities are first recovered and unified
within a single framework. Then we show that new global fluid instabilities can
be triggered in ellipsoids by tidal effects due to eccentric Kepler orbits.
Their existence is confirmed by a local analysis and direct numerical
simulations of the fully nonlinear and viscous problem. Thus a non-zero orbital
eccentricity may have a strong destabilising effect in celestial fluid bodies,
which may lead to space-filling turbulence in most of the parameters range.

accelerated nuclei are likely to interact with a dense photon field, leading to
a significant production of neutrinos and secondary particles. We model
numerically the propagation and interactions of high-energy nuclei in jetted

Carlo (MCMC) analysis, with which we forecast and compare with existing

that include dark energy equation of state and curvature parameters. We find
that the scatter in DM observations caused by inhomogeneities in the
intergalactic medium (IGM) poses a big challenge to the utility of FRBs as a
cosmic probe. Only in the most optimistic case, with a high number of events
and low IGM variance, do FRBs aid in improving current constraints. In
particular, when FRBs are combined with CMB+BAO+SNe+$H_0$ data, we find the
biggest improvement comes in the $\Omega_{\mathrm b}h^2$ constraint. Also, we
find that the dark energy equation of state is poorly constrained, while the
constraint on the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, shows some improvement when
combined with current constraints. When FRBs are combined with future BAO data
from 21cm Intensity Mapping (IM), we find little improvement over the
constraints from BAOs alone. However, the inclusion of FRBs introduces an
additional parameter constraint, $\Omega_{\mathrm b}h^2$, which turns out to be
comparable to existing constraints. This suggest that FRBs provide valuable
information about the cosmological baryon density in the intermediate redshift

coarsening in infinite volume when the process is started from a homogeneous

in the diffusive scaling limit, relating it to the local time of sticky

magnetohydrodynamics frame. A new process of collapse of the neutral current
sheet is demonstrated by means of analytical and numerical solutions. It shows
how at scales smaller than ion inertia length a compression of the sheet
triggers an explosive evolution of current perturbation. Collapse results in
the formation of a intense sub-sheet and then an X-point structure embedded
into the equilibrium sheet. Hall currents associated with this structure
support high reconnection rates. Nonlinear static solution at scales of the
electron skin reveals that electron inertia and small viscosity provide an
efficient mechanism of field lines breaking. The reconnection rate does not
depend on the actual value of viscosity, while the maximum current is found to
be restricted even for space plasmas with extremely rare collisions. The
results obtained are verified by a two-fluid large-scale numerical simulation.

confidence intervals based on inverse probability weighting estimators, such

scheme family has been widely used in varieties of compressive flow simulation.
However, for problems containing strong shocks and contact discontinuities,
such as the Lax shock tube problem, the WENO scheme still produces numerical
oscillations. To avoid such numerical oscillations, the characteristic-wise
construction method should be applied. Compared to component-wise
reconstruction, characteristic-wise reconstruction leads to much more
computational cost and thus is not suite for large scale simulation such as
direct numeric simulation of turbulence. In this paper, an adaptive
characteristic-wise reconstruction WENO scheme, i.e. the AdaWENO scheme, is
proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the characteristic-wise
reconstruction method. The new scheme performs characteristic-wise
reconstruction near discontinuities while switching to component-wise
reconstruction for smooth regions. Meanwhile, a new calculation strategy for
the WENO smoothness indicators is implemented to reduce over-all computational
cost. Several one dimensional and two dimensional numerical tests are performed
to validate and evaluate the AdaWENO scheme. Numerical results show that
AdaWENO maintains essentially non-oscillatory flow field near discontinuities
as the characteristic-wise reconstruction method. Besieds, compared to the
component-wise reconstruction, AdaWENO is about 40\% faster which indicates its
excellent efficiency.

over-smoothing, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC
methods. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial

evaluated our method on a parallel-data-free VC task. An objective evaluation
showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global

emission features have changed from spin-down to spin-up phase. This is well
supported by the differences in the timing characteristics (like pulse
profiles, QPOs etc) between spin-down and spin-up phases. We have also found
that during the current spin-up phase of 4U 1626-67, the X-ray pulse profile
below 2 keV is different compared to the spin-down phase. The X-ray light curve
also shows flares which produce a feature around 3 mHz in power density
spectrum of 4U 1626-67. Since flares are dominant at lower energies, the
feature around 3 mHz is prominent at low energies.

stratified in the vertical direction orthogonally to the horizontal shear.
Interest in such a flow comes from geophysical and astrophysical applications
where background shear and vertical stable stratification commonly coexist. We
perform the linear stability analysis of the flow in a domain which is periodic
in the stream-wise and vertical directions and confined in the cross-stream
direction. The stability diagram is constructed as a function of the Reynolds
number Re and the Froude number Fr, which compares the importance of shear and
stratification. We find that the flow becomes unstable when shear and
stratification are of the same order (i.e. Fr $\sim$ 1) and above a moderate
value of the Reynolds number Re$\gtrsim$700. The instability results from a
resonance mechanism already known in the context of channel flows, for instance
the unstratified plane Couette flow in the shallow water approximation. The
result is confirmed by fully non linear direct numerical simulations and to the
best of our knowledge, constitutes the first evidence of linear instability in
a vertically stratified plane Couette flow. We also report the study of a
laboratory flow generated by a transparent belt entrained by two vertical
cylinders and immersed in a tank filled with salty water linearly stratified in
density. We observe the emergence of a robust spatio-temporal pattern close to
the threshold values of F r and Re indicated by linear analysis, and explore
the accessible part of the stability diagram. With the support of numerical
simulations we conclude that the observed pattern is a signature of the same
instability predicted by the linear theory, although slightly modified due to
streamwise confinement.

situation: one can compute and compare graphs, describing the cerebral
connections between the very same, anatomically identified small regions of the
gray matter among hundreds of human subjects. The comparison of these graphs
has led to numerous recent results, as the (i) discovery that women's
connectomes have deeper and richer connectivity-related graph parameters like
those of men, or (ii) the description of more and less conservatively connected
lobes and cerebral regions, and (iii) the discovery of the phenomenon of the
Consensus Connectome Dynamics.
  Today one of the greatest challenges of brain science is the description and
modeling of the circuitry of the human brain. For this goal, we need to
identify sub-circuits that are present in almost all human subjects and those,
which are much less frequent: the former sub-circuits most probably have
functions with general importance, the latter sub-circuits are probably related
to the individual variability of the brain structure and functions. The present
contribution describes the frequent connected subgraphs (instead of
sub-circuits) of at most 6 edges in the human brain. We analyze these frequent
graphs and also examine sex differences in these graphs: we demonstrate
numerous connected sub-graphs that are more frequent in female or the male
connectome. While our results describe subgraphs, instead of sub-circuits, we
need to note that all macroscopic sub-circuits correspond to an underlying
connected subgraph.

are applying the data of 426 human subjects in this study.

In particular, every local optimum of a constrained monotone submodular

appropriate extension to the non-monotone setting. However, reaching a local
optimum quickly is a non-trivial task. Moreover, we describe a fast and very

match known approximation guarantees while disentangling and simplifying
previous approaches. Moreover, despite its generality, we are able to show that
our local search procedure is slightly faster than previous specialized
methods. Furthermore, we resolve an open question on the relation between
linear optimization and submodular maximization; namely, whether a linear
optimization oracle may be enough to obtain strong approximation algorithms for
submodular maximization. We show that this is not the case by providing an
example of a constraint family on a ground set of size $n$ for which, if only
given a linear optimization oracle, any algorithm for submodular maximization
with a polynomial number of calls to the linear optimization oracle will have
an approximation ratio of only $O ( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \cdot \frac{\log

optical resonator - both rigid or deformable - is considered in the framework
of general relativity. The optical resonator is modeled either as a rod of
matter connecting two mirrors or as a dielectric rod whose ends function as
mirrors. Explicit expressions for the frequency spectrum are derived for the
case that it is only perturbed slightly. For a deformable resonator, the
perturbation of the frequency spectrum depends on the speed of sound in the rod
supporting the mirrors. A connection is found to a relativistic concept of
rigidity when the speed of sound approaches the speed of light. In contrast,
the corresponding result for the assumption of Born rigidity is recovered when
the speed of sound becomes infinite. The results presented in this article can
be used as the basis for the description of optical and opto-mechanical systems

transiently between parallel plates or compact inclusions in a gas of
particles, following a change (""quench"") in temperature or activity of the
medium. Analytical calculations, as well as numerical simulations of passive or
active Brownian particles, indicate two distinct forces: (i) The immediate
effect of the quench is adsorption or desorption of particles of the medium to
the immersed objects, which in turn initiates a front of relaxing (mean)
density. This leads to time-dependent {\it density-induced forces}. (ii) A
long-term effect of the quench is that density fluctuations are modified,
manifested as transient (long-ranged) (pair-)correlations that relax
diffusively to their (short-ranged) steady-state limit. As a result, transient
{\it fluctuation-induced forces} emerge. We discuss the properties of
fluctuation-induced and density-induced forces as regards universality,
relaxation as a function of time, and scaling with distance between objects.
Their distinct signatures allow us to distinguish the two types of forces in
simulation data. Finally, we propose several scenarios for their experimental
observation.

range (SDR) imaging systems. The larger luminance range greatly improve the
overall quality of visual content, making it appears much more realistic and
appealing to observers. HDR is one of the key technologies of the future
imaging pipeline, which will change the way the digital visual content is
represented and manipulated today.

SPICA will be able to collect will help in clarifying the complex physical
mechanisms which underlie the baryon cycle of galaxies. In particular: (i) The
access to a large suite of atomic and ionic fine-structure lines for large
samples of galaxies will shed light on the origin of the observed spread in
star formation rates within and between galaxies. (ii) Observations of HD
rotational lines (out to $\sim$10 Mpc) and fine structure lines such as [CII]
158 $\mu$m (out to $\sim$100 Mpc) will clarify the main reservoirs of
interstellar matter in galaxies, including phases where CO does not emit. (iii)
Far-infrared spectroscopy of dust and ice features will address uncertainties
in the mass and composition of dust in galaxies, and the contributions of
supernovae to the interstellar dust budget will be quantified by photometry and
monitoring of supernova remnants in nearby galaxies. (iv) Observations of
far-infrared cooling lines such as [OI] 63 $\mu$m from star-forming molecular

ultra-thin LaMnO$_3$ films on the mostly used SrTiO$_3$ substrate is a
long-existing question under debate. Either strain effect or non-stoichiometry
was argued to be responsible for the experimental ferromagnetism. In a recent
experiment [Science \textbf{349}, 716 (2015)], one more mechanism, namely the
self-doping due to polar discontinuity, was argued to be the driving force of
ferromagnetism beyond the critical thickness. Here systematic first-principles
calculations have been performed to check these mechanisms in ultra-thin
LaMnO$_3$ films as well as superlattices. Starting from the very precise
descriptions of both LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$, it is found that the compressive
strain is the dominant force for the appearance of ferromagnetism, while the
open surface with oxygen vacancies leads to the suppression of ferromagnetism.
Within LaMnO$_3$ layers, the charge reconstructions involve many competitive
factors and certainly go beyond the intuitive polar catastrophe model
established for LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. Our study not only
explains the long-term puzzle regarding the magnetism of ultra-thin LaMnO$_3$
films, but also shed light on how to overcome the notorious magnetic dead layer

Neutral models assume that all the individuals are equivalent and that the

abundance distribution (SAD) that reflects a mutation-extinction equilibrium.
Recently, many empirical and theoretical studies emphasized the importance of
environmental variations that affect coherently the relative fitness of entire
populations. Here we consider two generic time-averaged neutral models, in both
the relative fitness of each species fluctuates independently in time but its
mean is zero. The first (model A) describes a system with local competition and
linear fitness-dependence of the birth-death rates, while in the second (model
B) the competition is global and the fitness dependence is nonlinear. Due to
this nonlinearity, model B admits a noise-induced stabilization mechanism that
facilitates the invasion of new mutants. A self-consistent mean-field approach
is used to reduce the multi-species problem to two-species dynamics, and the
large-$N$ asymptotics of the emerging set of Fokker-Planck equations is
presented and solved. Our analytic expressions are shown to fit the SADs

the nucleation of a pinned magnetic domain wall (DW) at the edges of the

elements of a list are distinct, that is, if $x=(x_1,...,x_N)$ is a list with
$N$ elements, we ask whether the elements of $x$ are distinct or not. The
solution in a classical computer requires $N$ queries because it uses sorting
to check whether there are equal elements. In the quantum case, it is possible
to solve the problem in $O(N^{2/3})$ queries. There is an extension which asks
whether there are $k$ colliding elements, known as element $k$-distinctness
problem.
  This work obtains optimal values of two critical parameters of Ambainis'
seminal quantum algorithm [SIAM J.~Comput., 37, 210-239, 2007]. The first
critical parameter is the number of repetitions of the algorithm's main block,
which inverts the phase of the marked elements and calls a subroutine. The
second parameter is the number of quantum walk steps interlaced by oracle
queries. We show that, when the optimal values of the parameters are used, the
algorithm's success probability is $1-O(N^{1/(k+1)})$, quickly approaching 1.
The specification of the exact running time and success probability is
important in practical applications of this algorithm.

sometimes generate mutually inconsistent data as a side-effect. Thus, some

examples where this selection is called for. We discuss how it can be done in a
self-consistent manner invoking a principle of maximal consensus of the
database and with the help of a sufficiently flexible model involving a minimal
number of theoretical assumptions. In the NN case this has become possible with
a combination of long distance field theoretical constraints at the hadronic

affine-rectification and radial lens distortion from coplanar repeated

rectification using the pinhole camera model is inaccurate or invalid. The
proposed solvers incorporate lens distortion into the camera model and extend
accurate rectification to wide-angle imagery, which is now common from consumer
cameras. The solvers are derived from constraints induced by the conjugate
translations of an imaged scene plane, which are integrated with the division
model for radial lens distortion. The hidden-variable trick with ideal
saturation is used to reformulate the constraints so that the solvers generated
by the Grobner-basis method are stable, small and fast.
  Rectification and lens distortion are recovered from either one conjugately
translated affine-covariant feature or two independently translated
similarity-covariant features. The proposed solvers are used in a \RANSAC-based
estimator, which gives accurate rectifications after few iterations. The
proposed solvers are evaluated against the state-of-the-art and demonstrate
significantly better rectifications on noisy measurements. Qualitative results
on diverse imagery demonstrate high-accuracy undistortions and rectifications.

record data over time. Dealing with this high-dimensional data is challenging
for every classifier for at least two aspects: First, an MTS is not only
characterized by individual feature values, but also by the interplay of
features in different dimensions. Second, this typically adds large amounts of
irrelevant data and noise. We present our novel MTS classifier WEASEL+MUSE
which addresses both challenges. WEASEL+MUSE builds a multivariate feature
vector, first using a sliding-window approach applied to each dimension of the
MTS, then extracts discrete features per window and dimension. The feature
vector is subsequently fed through feature selection, removing
non-discriminative features, and analysed by a machine learning classifier. The
novelty of WEASEL+MUSE lies in its specific way of extracting and filtering
multivariate features from MTS by encoding context information into each
feature. Still the resulting feature set is small, yet very discriminative and
useful for MTS classification. Based on a popular benchmark of 20 MTS datasets,
we found that WEASEL+MUSE is among the most accurate classifiers, when compared
to the state of the art. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL+MUSE is further
confirmed based on motion gesture recognition data, where it out-of-the-box
achieved similar accuracies as domain-specific methods.

the presence of dissipative frustration, provided by an interaction of the
system with the environment through two non-commuting operators. Such a model
can be realized in Josephson junction chains with shunt resistances and
resistances between the chain and the ground. Using a self-consistent harmonic
approximation, we determine the phase diagram at zero temperature which
exhibits a quantum phase transition between an ordered phase, corresponding to
the superconducting state, and a disordered phase, corresponding to the
insulating state with localized superconducting charge. Interestingly, we find
that the critical line separating the two phases has a non monotonic behavior
as a function of the dissipative coupling strength. This result is a
consequence of the frustration between (i) one dissipative coupling that
quenches the quantum phase fluctuations favoring the ordered phase and (ii) one
that quenches the quantum momentum (charge) fluctuations leading to a vanishing
phase coherence. Moreover, within the self-consistent harmonic approximation,
we analyze the dissipation induced crossover between a first and second order
phase transition, showing that quantum frustration increases the range in which
the phase transition is second order. The non monotonic behavior is reflected
also in the purity of the system that quantifies the degree of correlation
between the system and the environment, and in the logarithmic negativity as
entanglement measure that encodes the internal quantum correlations in the
chain.

perfect information modeled by a rooted treesome special Nash equilibrium in
pure strategies can be found by an algorithm of successive elimination of
leaves, which is now called backward induction. He also noticed the same
procedure, performed for the normal form of this game, turns into successive
elimination of dominated strategies of the players that results in a single
strategy profile (x_1,..., x_n), which is called a domination equilibrium (DE)
and appears to be a Nash-equilibrium (NE) too. In other words, the game in
normal form obtained from a positional game with perfect information is
dominance-solvable (DS) and also Nash-solvable (NS). Yet, an arbitrary game in
normal form may be not DS. We strengthen Gale's results as follows. Consider
several successive eliminations of dominated strategies that begins with X =
X_1 x ... x X_n and ends in X' = X'_1 x ... x X'_n. We will call X' a D-box of
X. Our main (but obvious) lemma claims that for any i =1,..., n} and for any
strategy x_i in X_i its projection to a D-box X' is dominated by a strategy
x'_i in X'_i. It follows that any DE is an NE and, hence, DS implies NS. It is
enough to apply the lemma in case when X' consists of a single strategy
profile. The same lemma implies that the domination procedure is well-defined.
A D-box X' is called terminal if it is domination-free, that is, it contains no
pair of strategies such that one of them is dominated by the other. Any two
terminal D-boxes X' and X"" of X are equal. More precisely, there exist $n$
permutations \pi = (\pi_1, ..., \pi_n)$, with \pi_i : X_i to X_i for i in I,

for transferring knowledge across several generations. Over the last two
hundred years, the use of prescriptive notations has been adopted for learning,
sight-playing and sight-singing. Prescriptive notations offer generic
guidelines for a raga rendition and do not include information about the
ornamentations or the gamakas, which are considered to be critical for
characterizing a raga. In this paper, we show that prescriptive notations
contain raga attributes and can reliably identify a raga of Carnatic music from
its octave-folded prescriptive notations. We restrict the notations to 7 notes
and suppress the finer note position information. A dictionary based approach
captures the statistics of repetitive note patterns within a raga notation. The
proposed stochastic models of repetitive note patterns (or SMRNP in short)
obtained from raga notations of known compositions, outperforms the state of
the art melody based raga identification technique on an equivalent melodic
data corresponding to the same compositions. This in turn shows that for
Carnatic music, the note transitions and movements have a greater role in
defining the raga structure than the exact note positions.

applications, such as model selection, calibration, optimization, quality

information regarding a prediction by answering the question ""Which uncertain
input factors are responsible for the uncertainty in the prediction?"" SA is
distinct from uncertainty analysis (UA), which instead addresses the question
""How uncertain is the prediction?"" As we discuss in the present paper much
confusion exists in the use of these terms. A proper uncertainty analysis of
the output of a mathematical model needs to map what the model does when the
input factors are left free to vary over their range of existence. A fortiori,
this is true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, most UA and SA still
explore the input space; moving along mono-dimensional corridors which leave
the space of variation of the input factors mostly unscathed. We use results
from a bibliometric analysis to show that many published SA fail the elementary
requirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results,
while discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and of
recognized good practices. The misuse of sensitivity analysis in mathematical
modelling is at least as serious as the misuse of the p-test in statistical
modelling. Mature methods have existed for about two decades to produce a
defensible sensitivity analysis. We end by offering a rough guide for proper
use of the methods.

time-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws on grids produced by the
intersection of complex geometries with a regular Cartesian grid is presented.
As it employs directional operator splitting, implementation of the scheme is
rather straightforward. Extending the method for static walls from Klein et
al., Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., A367, no. 1907, 4559-4575 (2009), the scheme
calculates fluxes needed for a conservative update of the near-wall cut-cells
as linear combinations of standard fluxes from a one-dimensional extended
stencil. Here the standard fluxes are those obtained without regard to the
small sub-cell problem, and the linear combination weights involve detailed
information regarding the cut-cell geometry. This linear combination of
standard fluxes stabilizes the updates such that the time-step yielding
marginal stability for arbitrarily small cut-cells is of the same order as that
for regular cells. Moreover, it renders the approach compatible with a wide
range of existing numerical flux-approximation methods. The scheme is extended
here to time dependent rigid boundaries by reformulating the linear combination
weights of the stabilizing flux stencil to account for the time dependence of
cut-cell volume and interface area fractions. The two-dimensional tests
discussed include advection in a channel oriented at an oblique angle to the
Cartesian computational mesh, cylinders with circular and triangular
cross-section passing through a stationary shock wave, a piston moving through

energy, its integral is an in-viscid invariant of the three-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. However, space-and time-discretization
methods typically corrupt this property, leading to violation of the inviscid
conservation principles. This work investigates the discrete helicity
conservation properties of spectral and finite-differencing methods, in
relation to the form employed for the convective term. Effects due to
Runge-Kutta time-advancement schemes are also taken into consideration in the
analysis. The theoretical results are proved against inviscid numerical
simulations, while a scale-dependent analysis of energy, helicity and their
non-linear transfers is performed to further characterize the discretization
errors of the different forms in forced helical turbulence simulations.

behaviour between faint and bright sources as well as between compact and
extended sources. These trends are explained in terms of radio galaxy
evolution. We also confirm earlier reports of an excess of steep-spectrum
sources along the galactic plane. This corresponds to 86 compact and
steep-spectrum source in excess compared to expectations. The properties of
this excess are consistent with normal non-recycled pulsars, which may have
been missed by pulsation searches due to larger than average scattering along

Audification translates data points into digital audio samples and the auditory
display's duration is determined by the playback rate. Like audification,
auditory graphs maintain the temporal relationships of data while using
parameter mappings (typically data-to-frequency) to represent the ordinate
values. Such direct approaches have the advantage of presenting the data stream
`as is' without the imposed interpretations or accentuation of particular
features found in indirect approaches. However, datasets can often be
subdivided into short non-overlapping variable length segments that each
encapsulate a discrete unit of domain-specific significant information and
current direct approaches cannot represent these. We present Direct Segmented
Sonification (DSSon) for highlighting the segments' data distributions as
individual sonic events. Using domain knowledge to segment data, DSSon presents
segments as discrete auditory gestalts while retaining the overall temporal
regime and relationships of the dataset. The method's structural decoupling
from the sound stream's formation means playback speed is independent of the
individual sonic event durations, thereby offering highly flexible time
compression/stretching to allow zooming into or out of the data. Demonstrated
by three models applied to biomechanical data, DSSon displays high directness,
letting the data `speak' for themselves.

progress in this field made recently by the Jerusalem--Prague Collaboration
using near-threshold $K^-N$ scattering amplitudes generated in several
meson--baryon coupled channels models inspired by a chiral EFT approach. Our
own procedure of handling subthreshold kinematics self consistently is used to
transform these free-space energy dependent amplitudes to in-medium density
dependent amplitudes from which $K^-$ optical potentials are derived. To fit
the world data of kaonic atoms, these single-nucleon optical potentials are
augmented by multi-nucleon terms. It is found that only two of the studied
models reproduce also the single-nucleon absorption fractions available from
old bubble chamber experiments. These two models are then checked for possible
$K^-$ nuclear quasibound states, despite realizing that $K^-$ optical
potentials are not constrained by kaonic atom data at densities exceeding half
nuclear-matter density. We find that when such states exist, their widths are
invariably above 100 MeV, forbiddingly large to allow observation.
Multi-nucleon absorption is found to be substantial in this respect. This
suggests that observable strongly bound $K^-$ mesons are limited to the very
light systems, such as $K^-pp$.

measurements exploit prior information to compensate for missing k-space data.
Deep learning (DL) provides a powerful framework for extracting such
information from existing image datasets, through learning, and then using it
for reconstruction. Leveraging this, recent methods employed DL to learn
mappings from undersampled to fully sampled images using paired datasets,
including undersampled and corresponding fully sampled images, integrating
prior knowledge implicitly. In this article, we propose an alternative approach
that learns the probability distribution of fully sampled MR images using
unsupervised DL, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and use this as
an explicit prior term in reconstruction, completely decoupling the encoding
operation from the prior. The resulting reconstruction algorithm enjoys a
powerful image prior to compensate for missing k-space data without requiring
paired datasets for training nor being prone to associated sensitivities, such
as deviations in undersampling patterns used in training and test time or coil
settings. We evaluated the proposed method with T1 weighted images from a
publicly available dataset, multi-coil complex images acquired from healthy
volunteers (N=8) and images with white matter lesions. The proposed algorithm,
using the VAE prior, produced visually high quality reconstructions and
achieved low RMSE values, outperforming most of the alternative methods on the
same dataset. On multi-coil complex data, the algorithm yielded accurate
magnitude and phase reconstruction results. In the experiments on images with
white matter lesions, the method faithfully reconstructed the lesions.

pairing mechanism in the related superconducting compounds. Even though the
chemical and electronic properties of these materials are often strongly
inhomogeneous on a nanometer length scale, studies of the magnetic phase
transitions using spatially resolved experimental techniques are still scarce.
Here, we present a real space spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy
investigation of the surface of Fe$_{1+y}$Te single crystals with different
excess Fe content, $y$, which are continuously driven through the magnetic
phase transition. For Fe$_{1.08}$Te, the transition into the low-temperature
monoclinic commensurate antiferromagnetic phase is accompanied by the sudden
emergence of ordering into four rotational domains with different orientations
of the monoclinic lattice and of the antiferromagnetic order, showing how
structural and magnetic order are intertwined. In the low-temperature phase of
Fe$_{1.12}$Te one type of the domain boundaries disappears, and the transition
into the paramagnetic phase gets rather broad, which is assigned to the
formation of a mixture of orthorhombic and monoclinic phases.

investigate the hydrodynamics of the plasma in a flaring coronal loop in which
heat conduction is limited by turbulent scattering of the electrons that
transport the thermal heat flux. The EBTEL equations are solved analytically in
each of the two (conduction-dominated and radiation-dominated) cooling phases.
Comparison of the results with typical observed cooling times in solar flares
shows that the turbulent mean free-path $\lambda_T$ lies in a range
corresponding to a regime in which classical (collision-dominated) conduction
plays at most a limited role. We also consider the magnitude and duration of
the heat input that is necessary to account for the enhanced values of
temperature and density at the beginning of the cooling phase and for the
observed cooling times. We find through numerical modeling that in order to
produce a peak temperature $\simeq 1.5 \times 10^7$~K and a 200~s cooling time
consistent with observations, the flare heating profile must extend over a
significant period of time; in particular, its lingering role must be taken
into consideration in any description of the cooling phase. Comparison with
observationally-inferred values of post-flare loop temperatures, densities, and
cooling times thus leads to useful constraints on both the magnitude and
duration of the magnetic energy release in the loop, as well as on the value of
the turbulent mean free-path $\lambda_T$.

mixing effective operators for achieving unification and large intermediate

successful unification for some breaking patterns, the scale of SUSY breaking
needs to be at least a few TeV. In some of these cases, the intermediate scale

marketplace platforms like the Amazon marketplace, AirBnB, Uber/Lyft, and
Upwork, where a central platform mediates economic transactions between buyers
and sellers. Motivated by these platforms, we formulate a set of facility
location problems that we term Two-sided Facility location. In our model,
agents arrive at nodes in an underlying metric space, where the metric distance
between any buyer and seller captures the quality of the corresponding match.
The platform posts prices and wages at the nodes, and opens a set of facilities
to route the agents to. The agents at any facility are assumed to be matched.
The platform ensures high match quality by imposing a distance constraint
between a node and the facilities it is routed to. It ensures high service
availability by ensuring flow to the facility is at least a pre-specified lower
bound. Subject to these constraints, the goal of the platform is to maximize
the social surplus (or gains from trade) subject to weak budget balance, i.e.,
profit being non-negative.
  We present an approximation algorithm for this problem that yields a $(1 +
\epsilon)$ approximation to surplus for any constant $\epsilon > 0$, while
relaxing the match quality (i.e., maximum distance of any match) by a constant
factor. We use an LP rounding framework that easily extends to other objectives
such as maximizing volume of trade or profit.
  We justify our models by considering a dynamic marketplace setting where
agents arrive according to a stochastic process and have finite patience (or
deadlines) for being matched. We perform queueing analysis to show that for
policies that route agents to facilities and match them, ensuring a low
abandonment probability of agents reduces to ensuring sufficient flow arrives
at each facility.

These stars are predicted to come from the Galactic center (GC) and travel
along unbound orbits across the Galaxy. In the coming years, the ESA satellite
Gaia will provide the most complete and accurate catalogue of the Milky Way,
with full astrometric parameters for more than $1$ billion stars. In this
paper, we present the expected sample size and properties (mass, magnitude,
spatial, velocity distributions) of HVSs in the Gaia stellar catalogue. We
build three Gaia mock catalogues of HVSs anchored to current observations,
exploring different ejection mechanisms and GC stellar population properties.
In all cases, we predict hundreds to thousands of HVSs with precise proper
motion measurements within a few tens of kpc from us. For stars with a relative
error in total proper motion below $10 \%$, the mass range extends to ~$10
M_{\odot}$ but peaks at ~$1$ $M_\odot$. The majority of Gaia HVSs will
therefore probe a different mass and distance range compared to the current
non-Gaia sample. In addition, a subset of a few hundreds to a few thousands of
HVSs with $M$ ~ $3$ $M_\odot$ will be bright enough to have a precise
measurement of the three-dimensional velocity from Gaia alone. Finally, we show
that Gaia will provide more precise proper motion measurements for the current
sample of HVS candidates. This will help identifying their birthplace narrowing
down their ejection location, and confirming or rejecting their nature as HVSs.
Overall, our forecasts are extremely encouraging in terms of quantity and
quality of HVS data that can be exploited to constrain both the Milky Way
potential and the GC properties.

at the base station (BS) $M$ is very large and typically much larger than the
number of served users (data streams) $K$. Recent research has illustrated the
system-level advantages of such a system and in particular the beneficial
effect of increasing the number of antennas $M$. These benefits, however, come
at the cost of dramatic increase in hardware and computational complexity. This
is partly due to the fact that the BS needs to compute suitable beamforming
vectors in order to coherently transmit/receive data to/from each user, where
the resulting complexity grows proportionally to the number of antennas $M$ and
the number of served users $K$. Recently, different algorithms based on tools
from random matrix theory in the asymptotic regime of $M,K \to \infty$ with
$\frac{K}{M} \to \rho \in (0,1)$ have been proposed to reduce such complexity.
The underlying assumption in all these techniques, however, is that the exact
statistics (covariance matrix) of the channel vectors of the users is a priori
known. This is far from being realistic, especially that in the high-dim regime
of $M\to \infty$, estimation of the underlying covariance matrices is well
known to be a very challenging problem.
  In this paper, we propose a novel technique for designing beamforming vectors
in a massive MIMO system. Our method is based on the randomized Kaczmarz
algorithm and does not require knowledge of the statistics of the users channel
vectors. We analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm theoretically and
compare its performance with that of other competitive techniques via numerical
simulations. Our results indicate that our proposed technique has a comparable
performance while it does not require the knowledge of the statistics of the
users channel vectors.

since their abundances are particularly sensitive to physical and chemical
variations. However, the chemistry of sulphur is not well understood in these
regions, notably because observations of several hot cores displayed a large
variety of sulphur compositions, and because the reservoir of sulphur in dense
clouds, in which hot cores form, is still poorly constrained. In order to help
disentangled its complexity, we present a fresh comprehensive review of sulphur
chemistry in hot cores along with a study of its sensibility to temperature and
pre-collapse chemical composition. In parallel, we analyse the discrepencies
that result from the use of two different types of models (static and dynamic)
to highlight the sensitivity to the choice of model to be used in astrochemical
studies. Our results show that the pre-collapse chemical composition is a
critical parameter for sulphur chemistry in hot cores and could explain the
different sulphur compositions observed. We also report that differences in
abundances for a given species between the static and dynamic models can reach
six orders of magnitude in the hot core, which reveals the key role of the
choice of model in astrochemical studies.

coordination control for the consensus problem of multi-agent differential
games by fuzzy adaptive dynamic programming (FADP), which brings together game
theory, generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model (GFHM) and adaptive dynamic
programming. In general, the optimal coordination control for multi-agent
differential games is the solution of the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
equations. Here, for the first time, GFHMs are used to approximate the solution
(value functions) of the coupled HJ equations, based on policy iteration (PI)
algorithm. Namely, for each agent, GFHM is used to capture the mapping between
the local consensus error and local value function. Since our scheme uses the
single-network rchitecture for each agent (which eliminates the action network
model compared with dual-network architecture), it is a more reasonable
architecture for multi-agent systems. Furthermore, the approximation solution
is utilized to obtain the optimal coordination controls. Finally, we give the
stability analysis for our scheme, and prove the weight estimation error and
the local consensus error are uniformly ultimately bounded. Further, the
control node trajectory is proven to be cooperative uniformly ultimately
bounded.

able to measure its luminosity and color. Decades of photometry on the system
now allow us to infer the effective temperature, radius, mass and age of each
binary component. We find our values to be in good agreement with previous
studies, including archival photographic photometry from the era when both
stars were fully visible, and they set the stage for a full model of the system
that can be constructed once radial velocity measurements are available. We
also present the first high sensitivity radio observations of the system, taken
with ALMA and the SMA. The respective 2.0 and 0.88 mm observations provide an
upper limit on the circumbinary (gas and dust) disk mass of 1.7 Jupiter masses
and reveal an extended CO outflow which overlaps with the position, systemic
velocity and orientation of the KH 15D system and is certainly associated with
it. The low velocity, tight collimation, and extended nature of the emission
suggest that the outflow is inclined nearly orthogonal to the line of sight,
implying it is also orthogonal to the circumbinary ring. The position angle of
the radio outflow also agrees precisely with the direction of polarization of
the optical emission during the faint phase. A small offset between the optical
image of the binary and the central line of the CO outflow remains as a puzzle
and possible clue to the jet launching mechanism.

investigated in detail the manner in which incoherent radiation passes through
a dispersive medium both from the frameworks of classical and quantum
electrodynamics, which led us to conclude that the premise of \cite{lieu13}
would only work if the pulses involved are genuinely classical ones involving
many photons per pulse, but unfortunately each photon must not be treated as a
pulse that is susceptible to dispersive broadening. We are nevertheless able to
change the tone of the paper at this juncture, by pointing out that because
current technology allows one to measure the phase of individual modes of radio
waves from a distant source, the most reliable way of obtaining irrefutable
evidence of dispersion, namely via the detection of its unique signature of a
quadratic spectral phase, may well be already accessible. We demonstrate how

not hold true due to various motivations of making online friends and dynamics
of online social networks. Inspired by recent causal process based
recommendations that first model user exposures towards items and then use
these exposures to guide rating prediction, we utilize social information to
capture user exposures rather than user preferences. We assume that people get
information of products from their online friends and they do not have to share
similar preferences, which is less restrictive and seems closer to reality.
Under this new assumption, in this paper, we present a novel recommendation
approach (named SERec) to integrate social exposure into collaborative
filtering. We propose two methods to implement SERec, namely social
regularization and social boosting, each with different ways to construct
social exposures. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods on top-N recommendations.

in a marginal state characterized by a heat flux that is fully controlled by
electron scattering off magnetic perturbations. This marginal heat flux does
not depend on the temperature gradient and scales as $1/\beta$. We confirm this
theoretical prediction by performing numerical particle-in-cell simulations of
the instability. We further calculate the saturation level of magnetic
perturbations and the electron scattering rate as functions of $\beta$ and the
temperature gradient to identify the saturation mechanism as quasilinear.
Suppression of the heat flux is caused by oblique whistlers with
magnetic-energy density distributed over a wide range of propagation angles.
This result can be applied to high-$\beta$ astrophysical plasmas, such as the
intracluster medium, where thermal conduction at sharp temperature gradients
along magnetic-field lines can be significantly suppressed. We provide a
convenient expression for the amount of suppression of the heat flux relative
to the classical Spitzer value as a function of the temperature gradient and
$\beta$. For a turbulent plasma, the additional independent suppression by the
mirror instability is capable of producing large total suppression factors

computational fluid dynamics (CFD). They allow easy implementations and
boundary handling. However, competitive time to solution not only depends on
the choice of a reasonable method, but also on an efficient implementation on
modern hardware. Hence, performance optimization has a long history in the
lattice Boltzmann community. A variety of options exists regarding the
implementation with direct impact on the solver performance. Experimenting and
evaluating each option often is hard as the kernel itself is typically embedded
in a larger code base. With our suite of lattice Boltzmann kernels we provide
the infrastructure for such endeavors. Already included are several kernels
ranging from simple to fully optimized implementations. Although these kernels
are not fully functional CFD solvers, they are equipped with a solid
verification method. The kernels may act as an reference for performance
comparisons and as a blue print for optimization strategies. In this paper we
give an overview of already available kernels, establish a performance model
for each kernel, and show a comparison of implementations and recent
architectures.

of squares lower bounds when the problem is symmetric under permutations of
$[1,n]$ and the unsatisfiability of our problem comes from integrality
arguments, i.e. arguments that an expression must be an integer. Roughly
speaking, to prove SOS lower bounds with our machinery it is sufficient to
verify that the answer to the following three questions is yes:
  1. Are there natural pseudo-expectation values for the problem?
  2. Are these pseudo-expectation values rational functions of the problem
parameters?
  3. Are there sufficiently many values of the parameters for which these
pseudo-expectation values correspond to the actual expected values over a
distribution of solutions which is the uniform distribution over permutations
of a single solution?
  We demonstrate our machinery on three problems, the knapsack problem analyzed
by Grigoriev, the MOD 2 principle (which says that the complete graph $K_n$ has
no perfect matching when $n$ is odd), and the following Turan type problem:
Minimize the number of triangles in a graph $G$ with a given edge density. For
knapsack, we recover Grigoriev's lower bound exactly. For the MOD 2 principle,
we tighten Grigoriev's linear degree sum of squares lower bound, making it
exact. Finally, for the triangle problem, we prove a sum of squares lower bound
for finding the minimum triangle density. This lower bound is completely new
and gives a simple example where constant degree sum of squares methods have a
constant factor error in estimating graph densities.

phase to reduce computational costs and ensure good conditioning of the linear
systems required to enforce incompressibility. However, this free surface
assumption leads to an inability to realistically treat bubbles: submerged gaps
in the liquid are interpreted as empty voids that immediately collapse. To
address this shortcoming, we present an efficient, practical, and conceptually
simple approach to augment free surface flows with negligible density bubbles.
Our method adds a new constraint to each disconnected air region that
guarantees zero net flux across its entire surface, and requires neither
simulating both phases nor reformulating into stream function variables.
Implementation of the method requires only minor modifications to the pressure
solve of a standard grid-based fluid solver, and yields linear systems that
remain sparse and symmetric positive definite. In our evaluations, solving the
modified pressure projection system took no more than 10% longer than the
corresponding free surface solve. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
flexibility by incorporating it into commercial fluid animation software and
using it to generate a variety of dynamic bubble scenarios showcasing glugging
effects, viscous and inviscid bubbles, interactions with irregularly-shaped and
moving solid boundaries, and surface tension effects.

quiet Sun regions. Current segmentation methods typically rely on the use of

Coronal Hole Identification via Multi-thermal Emission Recognition Algorithm
(CHIMERA) is described, which analyses multi-thermal images from the
Atmospheric Image Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
to segment coronal hole boundaries by their intensity ratio across three
passbands (171 \AA, 193 \AA, and 211 \AA). The algorithm allows accurate
extraction of CH boundaries and many of their properties, such as area,
position, latitudinal and longitudinal width, and magnetic polarity of
segmented CHs. From these properties, a clear linear relationship was
identified between the duration of geomagnetic storms and coronal hole areas.
CHIMERA can therefore form the basis of more accurate forecasting of the start

energies. Recently, the first DAMPE results on the CRE flux hinted at a narrow
excess at energy ~1.4 TeV. We show that in general a spectral structure with a
narrow width appears in two scenarios: I) ""Spectrum broadening"" for the
continuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this
scenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy,
which can reveal the distance of the source. Well-motivated sources include
mini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles $\chi_{s}$ which
annihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) ""Phase-space shrinking"" for burst-like
sources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after
propagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a sharp
spectral peak. The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent
diffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power
index and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind
nebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and
find that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within ~0.3 kpc, and
the annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the
burst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection
spectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the
distance is within ~(3-4) kpc, and the age of the source is ~0.16 Myr. In both
scenarios, large anisotropies in the CRE flux are predicted. We identify
possible candidates of mini-spike (PWN) sources in the current Fermi-LAT 3FGL
(ATNF) catalog. The diffuse gamma-rays from these sources can be well below the
Galactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and less constrained by the Ferm-LAT
data, if they are located at the low Galactic latitude regions.

this digraph by defining a suitable mapping from the vertex set to the real
line. Next we study oriented interval catch digraphs (oriented ICD). We
characterize augmented adjacency matrix of an oriented ICD when it is a
tournament. Also we characterize an oriented ICD whose underlying graph is a
tree. Further we obtain characterization of the adjacency matrix of a proper
interval catch digraph. Another important result is to provide forbidden
subdigraph characterization of those proper oriented interval catch digraphs

quantum cohomology. First, we construct a family version of
$A_\infty$-structure on quantum cohomology (this should morally correspond to
Hochschild cohomology of a ""family of Fukaya categories over the circle"").
Following Kaledin, we look at the obstruction class of this structure, and
argue that it can be related to a quantum version of Massey products on the one
hand (which, in nice cases, can be related to actual counts of rational curves)
and to the classical Andreadakis-Johnson theory of the Torelli group on the
other hand.
  In the second part of the paper, we go hunting for exotic symplectomorphism:
these are elements of infinite order in the kernel $$\mathcal{K}(M,\omega) :=
\pi_0 \mathrm{Symp}(M,\omega) \to \pi_0 \mathrm{Diff}^+(M,\omega)$$ of the
forgetful map from the symplectic mapping class group to the ordinary MCG. We
demonstrate how we can apply the theory above to prove the existence of such
elements $\psi_Y$ for certain a Fano 3-fold obtained by blowing-up
$\mathbb{P}^3$ at a genus 4 curve. Unlike the four-dimensional case, no power
of a Dehn twist around Lagrangian 3-spheres can be exotic (because they have
infinite order in smooth MCG).
  In the final part of the paper, the classical connection between our Fano
varieties and cubic 3-folds allows us to prove the existence of a new
phenomena: ""exotic relations"" in the subgroup generated by all Dehn twists.
Namely, it turns out we can factor some power of $[\psi_Y]$ in $\pi_0
\mathrm{Symp}(Y,\omega)$ into 3-dimensional Dehn twists. So the isotopy class
of the product in the ordinary MCG is torsion, but of infinite order in the

schemes requiring strong line-of-sight conditions between the source and

calibration-free system, WiSpeed saves the users' efforts from large-scale
training and fine-tuning of system parameters. In addition, WiSpeed could
extract the stride length as well as detect abnormal activities such as falling
down, a major threat to seniors that leads to a large number of fatalities

show that the polarization's rotation can be explained by an optical splitting

commands which are given by people and which refer to the robot's physical
surroundings. Such interpretation is known variously as the symbol grounding
problem, grounded semantics and grounded language acquisition. This problem is
challenging because people employ diverse vocabulary and grammar, and because
robots have substantial uncertainty about the nature and contents of their
surroundings, making it difficult to associate the constitutive language
elements (principally noun phrases and spatial relations) of the command text
to elements of those surroundings. Symbolic models capture linguistic structure
but have not scaled successfully to handle the diverse language produced by
untrained users. Existing statistical approaches can better handle diversity,
but have not to date modeled complex linguistic structure, limiting achievable
accuracy. Recent hybrid approaches have addressed limitations in scaling and
complexity, but have not effectively associated linguistic and perceptual
features. Our framework, called Generalized Grounding Graphs (G^3), addresses
these issues by defining a probabilistic graphical model dynamically according
to the linguistic parse structure of a natural language command. This approach
scales effectively, handles linguistic diversity, and enables the system to
associate parts of a command with the specific objects, places, and events in
the external world to which they refer. We show that robots can learn word
meanings and use those learned meanings to robustly follow natural language
commands produced by untrained users. We demonstrate our approach for both
mobility commands and mobile manipulation commands involving a variety of

possibilities for imaging nanoscale lattice distortions in bulk crystalline

reciprocal space at high energies typically results in poorly resolved fringes
on an area detector, rendering the diffraction data unsuitable for the
three-dimensional reconstruction of compact crystals. To address this problem,
we propose a method by which to recover fine fringe detail in the scattered
intensity. This recovery is achieved in two steps: multiple undersampled
measurements are made by in-plane sub-pixel motion of the area detector, then
this data set is passed to a sparsity-based numerical solver that recovers
fringe detail suitable for standard Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI)
reconstruction methods of compact single crystals. The key insight of this
paper is that sparsity in a BCDI data set can be enforced by recognising that
the signal in the detector, though poorly resolved, is band-limited. This
requires fewer in-plane detector translations for complete signal recovery,
while adhering to information theory limits. We use simulated BCDI data sets to
demonstrate the approach, outline our sparse recovery strategy, and comment on
future opportunities.

anharmonicity while the effect of cubic anharmonicity is essentially reduced.
This reduction effect is a consequence of small amplitude of vibrations of
every second atom. As a result, an ILM cannot split down from the optical
phonon band, in contradiction with the commonly accepted point of view. But it
can spit up from the top of the acoustic phonon band making possible the
existence of the ILM with the frequencies above the top of this band. It is
predicted that analogous reduction of cubic anharmonicity should exist

mean square error (RMSE) of 0.22 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of
11.3% for the interstate/expressway functional class. This model also shows a
higher R-squared value compared to the traditional factor-based model and
regression model. SVR models are validated for each roadway functional class
using the 2016 ATR data and selected short-term count data collected by the
South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT). The validation results
show that the SVR-based AADT estimation models can be used by the SCDOT as a
reliable option to predict AADT from the short-term counts.

  Redundant Generation of Class Labels for 3D Spine Modeling","18 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a significant increase from 2010 to 2016 in the number of
people suffering from spine problems. The automatic image segmentation of the
spine obtained from a computed tomography (CT) image is important for
diagnosing spine conditions and for performing surgery with computer-assisted
surgery systems. The spine has a complex anatomy that consists of 33 vertebrae,
23 intervertebral disks, the spinal cord, and connecting ribs. As a result, the
spinal surgeon is faced with the challenge of needing a robust algorithm to
segment and create a model of the spine. In this study, we developed an
automatic segmentation method to segment the spine, and we compared our
segmentation results with reference segmentations obtained by experts. We
developed a fully automatic approach for spine segmentation from CT based on a
hybrid method. This method combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and
fully convolutional network (FCN), and utilizes class redundancy as a soft
constraint to greatly improve the segmentation results. The proposed method was
found to significantly enhance the accuracy of the segmentation results and the
system processing time. Our comparison was based on 12 measurements: the Dice
coefficient (94%), Jaccard index (93%), volumetric similarity (96%),
sensitivity (97%), specificity (99%), precision (over segmentation; 8.3 and
under segmentation 2.6), accuracy (99%), Matthews correlation coefficient
(0.93), mean surface distance (0.16 mm), Hausdorff distance (7.4 mm), and
global consistency error (0.02). We experimented with CT images from 32
patients, and the experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of the
proposed method.

for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often
used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or
difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the
creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically
optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been
some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable
colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the
most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We
developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which
imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe
colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is
made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their
own CVDoptimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap
created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD
as well as those with redgreen colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables
nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually
uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.

are very aggressive and with poor prognosis. Targeted therapies have been
developed extensively in preclinical and clinical studies to open the way for
new treatment strategies. The present study has focused on developing 3D cell
cultures from SUM1315 and MDA-MB-231, two triple-negative basal-like (TNBL)
breast cancer cell lines, using the liquid overlay technique. Extracellular
matrix concentration, cell density, proliferation, cell viability, topology and
ultrastructure parameters were determined. The results showed that for both
cell lines, the best conditioning regimen for compact and homogeneous spheroid
formation was to use 1000 cells per well and 2% Geltrex. This conditioning
regimen highlighted two 3D cell models: non-proliferative SUM1315 spheroids and
proliferative MDA-MB-231 spheroids. In both cell lines, the comparison of 2D vs
3D cell culture viability in the presence of increasing concentrations of
chemotherapeutic agents i.e. cisplatin, docetaxel and epirubicin, showed that
spheroids were clearly less sensitive than monolayer cell cultures. Moreover, a
proliferative or non-proliferative 3D cell line property would enable
determination of cytotoxic and/or cytostatic drug activity. 3D cell culture
could be an excellent tool in addition to the arsenal of techniques currently
used in preclinical studies. http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions with several assumptions. The origin of the
microscopic entropy of this black hole is investigated using the conjectured
Kerr/CFT correspondence which is originally proposed for extremal Kerr black
holes. The isometry of the near-horizon extremal Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole
shows that the asymptotic symmetry group may be implemented to compute the
central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Furthermore, by assuming Frolov-Thorne
vacuum, the conformal temperatures can be obtained. Then by using the Cardy
formula, the microscopic entropy is gained which matches the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy. We also employ Cardy prescription to find the logarithmic correction
of the entropy. Then at limit $ a \rightarrow 0 $, the extremal
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-NUT solution is recovered and by enhancing with the
fibered coordinate we find the five-dimensional (5D) solution. The second dual
CFT is applied to this black hole to gain the entropy. Finally, the microscopic
entropy is still in agreement with the area law of 5D black hole solution.
Hence, the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om-NUT solution is holographically dual
to the CFT.

from a limited number of CVs (i.e., low CV penetration rate) and not from other

wireless CV environment contributes to the unavailability of data from the
limited number of CVs. Thus, it is very challenging to predict traffic
behavior, which changes dynamically over time, with the limited CV data. The
primary objective of this study was to develop an adaptive queue prediction
algorithm to predict real-time queue status in the CV environment in an
edge-centric cyber-physical system (CPS), which is a relatively new CPS
concept. The adaptive queue prediction algorithm was developed using a machine
learning algorithm with a real-time feedback system. The algorithm was
evaluated using SUMO (i.e., Simulation of Urban Mobility) and ns3 (Network
Simulator 3) simulation platforms to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm
on a roadway network in Clemson, South Carolina, USA. The performance of the
adaptive queue prediction application was measured in terms of queue detection
accuracy with varying CV penetration levels and data loss rates. The analyses
revealed that the adaptive queue prediction algorithm with feedback system
outperforms without feedback system algorithm.

question of whether polarized individuals can fruitfully cooperate becomes
pressing. Although diversity of individual perspectives typically leads to
superior team performance on complex tasks, strong political perspectives have
been associated with conflict, misinformation and a reluctance to engage with
people and perspectives beyond one's echo chamber. It is unclear whether
self-selected teams of politically diverse individuals will create higher or
lower quality outcomes. In this paper, we explore the effect of team political
composition on performance through analysis of millions of edits to Wikipedia's
Political, Social Issues, and Science articles. We measure editors' political
alignments by their contributions to conservative versus liberal articles. A
survey of editors validates that those who primarily edit liberal articles
identify more strongly with the Democratic party and those who edit
conservative ones with the Republican party. Our analysis then reveals that
polarized teams---those consisting of a balanced set of politically diverse
editors---create articles of higher quality than politically homogeneous teams.
The effect appears most strongly in Wikipedia's Political articles, but is also
observed in Social Issues and even Science articles. Analysis of article ""talk
pages"" reveals that politically polarized teams engage in longer, more
constructive, competitive, and substantively focused but linguistically diverse
debates than political moderates. More intense use of Wikipedia policies by
politically diverse teams suggests institutional design principles to help
unleash the power of politically polarized teams.

state that are protected from the rapid radiative decay imposed by the system

the expense of optical accessibility. Breaking the symmetry by using magnetic
and electric fields has been employed to hybridize dark and bright states thus
making them optically active, but high-frequency and on-chip operation remains
to be developed. Here we demonstrate the strain-induced coherent coupling of
dark and bright exciton states in a GaAs mechanical resonator. The in-plane
uniaxial strain breaks the rotational symmetry of the crystal, allowing the
dark states to be optically accessible without any external fields. Such
dark-bright coupling is tailored by the local strain distribution, which
enables the coherent spin operation in the gigahertz regime and opens the way
