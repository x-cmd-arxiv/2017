algebraic K-polystability for polarized manifolds. Hence our main result
recovers a possibly stronger version of results of Berman-Darvas-Lu in this

singularity type prescribed by singular test configurations, and prove a result
on asymptotics of the K-energy functional along such rays.

dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. We compared different parametrisations for
the cloud particle size, by either fixing particle radii, or fixing the mixing
efficiency (parameter fsed) or estimating particle radii from simple
microphysics. The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears as the best
parametrisation by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra
of brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the
L-T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the
visible/near-IR photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for
low-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity.
In addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical
equilibriums, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature.
This effect should significantly contribute to the strong variation of methane
abundance at the L-T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young
exoplanets. Finally, we predict the existence of a continuum of brown dwarfs
and exoplanets for absolute J magnitude=15-18 and J-K color=0-3, due to the
evolution of the L-T transition with gravity. This self-consistent model
therefore provides a general framework to understand the effects of clouds and
appears well-suited for atmospheric retrievals.

criteria provided insight when traditional criteria fail to differentiate
between designs. We theoretically study the relationship between the MAP
criteria and traditional quantities, and demonstrate the use of SEAS for
comparing some example supersaturated designs, including designs suggested in

probability that a triangle is obtuse, Prob(Obtuse). This arises by
straightforward combination of a) Kendall's Theorem - that the space of all
triangles is a sphere - and b) the natural map sending triangles in space to
points in this shape sphere. The answer is 3/4. Our method moreover readily
generalizes to a wider class of problems, since a) and b) both have many
applications and admit large generalizations: Shape Theory. An elementary and
thus widely accessible prototype for Shape Theory is thereby desirable, and
extending Kendall's already-notable prototype a) by demonstrating that b)
readily solves Lewis Carroll's well-known pillow problem indeed provides a
memorable and considerably stronger prototype. This is a prototype of, namely,
mapping flat geometry problems directly realized in a space to shape space,
where differential-geometric tools are readily available to solve the problem
and then finally re-interpret it in the original `shape-in-space' terms. We
illustrate this program's versatility by posing and solving a number of
variants of the pillow problem. We first find Prob(Isosceles is Obtuse). We
subsequently define tall and flat triangles, as bounded by regular triangles
whose base-to-median ratio is that of the equilateral triangle. These
definitions have Jacobian and Hopfian motivation as well as entering Kendall's
own considerations of `splinters': almost-collinear triangles. We find that
Prob(Tall) = 1/2 = Prob(Flat) is immediately apparent from regularity's
symmetric realization in shape space. However, Prob(Obtuse and Flat),
Prob(Obtuse is Flat) and all other nontrivial expressions concerning having any

introduced in order to express Dupree renormalized dispersion relations used in
quasi-linear theory. For instance the Dupree renormalized dispersion relation
for gyrokinetic, toroidal ion temperature gradient driven (ITG) modes, where
the Dupree's diffusion coefficient is assumed to be a low order polynomial of
the velocity, can be written entirely using generalized curvature modified
plasma dispersion functions: Knm's. Using those, Dupree's formulation of
renormalized quasi-linear theory is revisited for the toroidal ITG mode. The
Dupree diffusion coefficient has been obtained as a function of velocity using
an iteration scheme, first by assuming that the diffusion coefficient is
constant at each v (i.e. applicable for slow dependence), and then substituting
the resulting v dependence in the form of complex polynomial coefficients into
the Knm's for verification. The algorithm generally converges rapidly after
only a few iterations. Since the quasi-linear calculation relies on an assumed

if, after identifying the high-level concept of an image, a network could move

that specialize in unrelated aspects. Ideally, the more a network already knows
about an image, the better it should be at deciding which layer to compute
next. In this work, we propose convolutional networks with adaptive inference
graphs (ConvNet-AIG) that adaptively define their network topology conditioned
on the input image. Following a high-level structure similar to residual
networks (ResNets), ConvNet-AIG decides for each input image on the fly which
layers are needed. In experiments on ImageNet we show that ConvNet-AIG learns
distinct inference graphs for different categories. Both ConvNet-AIG with 50

less computations respectively. By grouping parameters into layers for related
classes and only executing relevant layers, ConvNet-AIG improves both

of adaptive inference graphs on the susceptibility towards adversarial

sensitivities, or gradients of expectations of sufficiently smooth functionals,
of a reflected diffusion in a convex polyhedral domain with respect to its
defining parameters --- namely, its initial condition, drift and diffusion
coefficients, and directions of reflection. Our method, which falls into the
class of infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) methods, uses a
probabilistic representation for such sensitivities as the expectation of a
functional of the reflected diffusion and its associated derivative process.
The latter process is the unique solution to a constrained linear stochastic
differential equation with jumps whose coefficients, domain and directions of
reflection are modulated by the reflected diffusion. We propose an
asymptotically unbiased estimator for such sensitivities using an Euler
approximation of the reflected diffusion and its associated derivative process.
Proving that the Euler approximation converges is challenging because the
derivative process jumps whenever the reflected diffusion hits the boundary (of
the domain). A key step in the proof is establishing a continuity property of
the related derivative map, which is of independent interest. We compare the
performance of our IPA estimator to a standard likelihood ratio estimator
(whenever the latter is applicable), and provide numerical evidence that the
variance of the former is substantially smaller than that of the latter. We
illustrate our method with an example of a rank-based interacting diffusion
model of equity markets. Interestingly, we show that estimating certain
sensitivities of the rank-based interacting diffusion model using our method
for a reflected Brownian motion description of the model outperforms a finite
difference method for a stochastic differential equation description of the
model.

regard to electrochemical energy storage devices, this leads to high-energy

uncertain, especially with the penetration of distributed power. Load
forecasting matters to the effective operation of power system. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning framework to forecast the short-term grid load.
First, the load data is processed by Box-Cox transformation, and two parameters
(electricity price and temperature) are investigated. Then, to quantify the
tail-dependence of power load on the two parameters, parametric Copula models
are fitted and the threshold of peak load are computed. Next, a deep belief
network is built to forecast the hourly load of the power grid. One year grid
load data collected from an urbanized area in Texas, United States is utilized
in the case studies. Short-term load forecasting are examined in four seasons
independently. Day-ahead and week-ahead load forecasting experiments are
conducted in each season using the proposed framework. The proposed framework
is compared with classical neural networks, support vector regression machine,
extreme learning machine, and classical deep belief networks. The load
forecasting performances are assessed by mean absolute percentage error, root
mean square error, and hit rate. Computational results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed data-driven deep learning framework. The
prediction accuracies of both day-ahead forecasting and week-ahead forecasting
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the tested algorithms.

reported. The analysis also targets spin-0 mediator models, where the mediator
decays into a pair of dark-matter particles and is produced in association with
a pair of top quarks. The search uses data from proton-proton collisions
delivered by the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass
energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb$^{-1}$. A wide range of signal scenarios
with different mass-splittings between the top squark, the lightest neutralino
and possible intermediate supersymmetric particles are considered, including
cases where the W bosons or the top quarks produced in the decay chain are
off-shell. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is
observed. The null results are used to set exclusion limits at 95% confidence
level in several supersymmetry benchmark models. For pair-produced top-squarks
decaying into top quarks, top-squark masses up to 940 GeV are excluded.
Stringent exclusion limits are also derived for all other considered top-squark
decay scenarios. For the spin-0 mediator models, upper limits are set on the
visible cross-section.

Finding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics
have become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. Existing methods
relied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova
candidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of
temporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch
observations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a
novel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images
without any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the
state-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric
approach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating
the luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another
neural network for the classification, where the estimated luminance and
observation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural
networks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa
directly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness
of the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to
existing photometric methods with multi-epoch observations.

on plate boundaries. These slip transients are the slow release of built-up
tectonic stress that are geodetically imaged as a predominantly aseismic
rupture, which is smooth in both time and space. We demonstrate here that large
slow slip events are in fact a cluster of short-duration slow transients. Using
a dense catalog of low-frequency earthquakes as a guide, we investigate the
$M_w7.5$ slow slip event that occurred in 2006 along the subduction interface
40~km beneath Guerrero, Mexico. We show that while the long-period surface
displacement as recorded by GPS suggests a six month duration, motion in the
direction of tectonic release only sporadically occurs over 55 days and its
surface signature is attenuated by rapid relocking of the plate interface.These
results demonstrate that our current conceptual model of slow and continuous
rupture is an artifact of low-resolution geodetic observations of a
superposition of small, clustered slip events. Our proposed description of slow
slip as a cluster of slow transients implies that we systematically
overestimate the duration $T$ and underestimate the moment magnitude $M$ of
large slow slip events.

popularity distributions by mapping the model dynamics to corresponding Markov
chains and branching processes, respectively. These distributions follow
power-laws with well defined exponents that are within the range of the
empirical data reported in ecologies. Interestingly, by varying the innovation
rate, this simple out-of-equilibrium model exhibits many of the characteristics
of a continuous phase transition and, around the critical point, it generates
time series with power-law popularity, lifetime and inter-event time
distributions, and non-trivial temporal correlations, such as a bursty dynamics
in analogy with the activity of solar flares. Our results suggest that an
appropriate balance between innovation and oblivion rates could provide an
explanatory framework for many of the properties commonly observed in many

the S density of states and thermopower for a range of temperatures,
Zeeman-splitting, and spin-flip scattering. In contrast to the naive
expectation based on the negative effect of spin-flip scattering on Cooper
pairing, we find that the spin-flip scattering strongly enhances the
thermoelectric performance of the system in the low-field and low-temperature
regime. This is attributed to a complex interplay between the charge and spin
conductances caused by the softening of the spin-dependent superconducting
gaps. The maximal value of the thermopower exceeds $k_{B}/e$ by a factor of
$\approx$ 5 and has a nonmonotonic dependence on spin-splitting and spin-flip
rate.

quasiparticle density of states of two-dimensional d-wave superconductors using
an exact real-space method, incorporating realistic details known about the
cuprates. Random on-site energy and pointlike unitary impurity models are found
to give rise to a vanishing DOS at the Fermi energy for narrow distributions
and low concentrations, respectively, and lead to a finite, but suppressed, DOS
at unrealistically large levels of disorder. Smooth disorder arising from
impurities located away from the copper-oxide planes meanwhile gives rise to a
finite DOS at realistic impurity concentrations. For the case of smooth
disorder whose average potential is zero, a resonance is found at zero energy
for the quasiparticle DOS at large impurity concentrations. We discuss the
implications of these results on the computed low-temperature specific heat,
the behavior of which we find is strongly affected by the amount of disorder
present in the system. We also compute the localization length as a function of
disorder strength for various types of disorder and find that intermediate- and
high-energy states are quasi-extended for low disorder, and that states near
the Fermi energy are strongly localized and have a localization length that
exhibits an unusual dependence on the amount of disorder. We comment on the
origin of disorder in the cuprates and provide constraints on these based on
known results from scanning tunneling spectroscopy and specific heat
experiments.

constraints that explicitly enforce conservation over subdomains. Conservative
Galerkin projection arises from formulating this optimization problem at the
time-continuous level, while conservative least-squares Petrov--Galerkin (LSPG)
projection associates with a time-discrete formulation. We equip these
approaches with hyper-reduction techniques in the case of nonlinear flux and
source terms, and also provide approaches for handling infeasibility. In
addition, we perform analyses that include deriving conditions under which
conservative Galerkin and conservative LSPG are equivalent, as well as deriving
a posteriori error bounds. Numerical experiments performed on a parameterized
quasi-1D Euler equation demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to
ensure not only global conservation, but also significantly lower state-space

to significant supercooling. A notorious example is the phase transition in
Randall-Sundrum models or their CFT duals. In fact, it was found that the phase
transition in this case is first-order and the tunneling probability for the
radion/dilaton is so small that the system typically remains trapped in the
false vacuum and the phase transition never completes. The universe then keeps
expanding and cooling. Eventually the temperature drops below the QCD scale. We
show that the QCD condensates which subsequently form give an additional
contribution to the radion/dilaton potential, an effect which had been ignored
so far. This significantly reduces the barrier in the potential and allows the
phase transition to complete in a substantially larger region of parameter
space. Due to the supercooling, electroweak symmetry is then broken
simultaneously. This class of models therefore naturally leads to an
electroweak phase transition taking place at or below QCD temperatures, with
interesting cosmological implications and signatures.

attention in recent years. However, the intrinsic domain difference between
synthetic and real images usually causes a significant performance drop when
applying the learned model to real world scenarios. This is mainly due to two
reasons: 1) the model overfits to synthetic images, making the convolutional
filters incompetent to extract informative representation for real images; 2)
there is a distribution difference between synthetic and real data, which is
also known as the domain adaptation problem. To this end, we propose a new
reality oriented adaptation approach for urban scene semantic segmentation by
learning from synthetic data. First, we propose a target guided distillation
approach to learn the real image style, which is achieved by training the
segmentation model to imitate a pretrained real style model using real images.
Second, we further take advantage of the intrinsic spatial structure presented
in urban scene images, and propose a spatial-aware adaptation scheme to
effectively align the distribution of two domains. These two modules can be
readily integrated with existing state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
networks to improve their generalizability when adapting from synthetic to real
urban scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on Cityscapes dataset by adapting
from GTAV and SYNTHIA datasets, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

the anti-Pfaffian (aPf) state, recent experiments appear to favor a quantized
thermal hall conductivity with quantum number $K=5/2$ , rather than the value
$K=7/2$ or $K=3/2$ expected for the Pf or aPF state, respectively. While a
particle hole symmetric topological order (the PH-Pfaffian) would be consistent
with the experiments, this state is believed to be energetically unfavorable in
a homogenous system. Here we study the effects of disorder that are assumed to
locally nucleate domains of Pf and aPf. When the disorder is relatively weak
and the size of domains is relatively large, we find that when the electrical
Hall conductance is on the quantized plateau with $\sigma_{xy} = (5/2)(e^2/h)$,
the value of $K$ can be only 7/2 or 3/2, with a possible first-order-like
transition between them as the magnetic field is varied. However, for
sufficiently strong disorder an intermediate state might appear, which we
analyze within a network model of the domain walls. Predominantly, we find a
thermal metal phase, where $K$ varies continuously and the longitudinal thermal
conductivity is non-zero, while the electrical Hall conductivity remains
quantized at $(5/2)e^2/h$. However, in a restricted parameter range we find a
thermal insulator with $K=5/2$, a disorder stabilized phase which is
adiabatically connected to the PH-Pfaffian. We discuss a possible scenario to
rationalize these special values of parameters.

microscopic structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Utilizing an effective
Hamiltonian which includes both light- and heavy-parton degrees of freedoms.
The basic two-body interaction includes color-Coulomb and confining
contributions in all available color channels, and is constrained by
lattice-QCD data for the heavy-quark free energy. The in-medium $T$-matrices
and parton spectral functions are computed selfconsistently with full account
of off-shell properties encoded in large scattering widths. We apply the
$T$-matrices to calculate the equation of state (EoS) for the QGP, including a
ladder resummation of the Luttinger-Ward functional using a matrix-log
technique to account for the dynamical formation of bound states. It turns out
that the latter become the dominant degrees of freedom in the EoS at low QGP
temperatures indicating a transition from parton to hadron degrees of freedom.
The calculated spectral properties of one- and two-body states confirm this
picture, where large parton scattering rates dissolve the parton quasiparticle
structures while broad resonances start to form as the pseudocritical
temperature is approached from above. Further calculations of transport
coefficients reveal a small viscosity and heavy-quark diffusion coefficient.

distributions. Specifically, given samples from a discrete random variable $(X,
Y, Z)$ on domain $[\ell_1]\times[\ell_2] \times [n]$, we want to distinguish,
with probability at least $2/3$, between the case that $X$ and $Y$ are
conditionally independent given $Z$ from the case that $(X, Y, Z)$ is
$\epsilon$-far, in $\ell_1$-distance, from every distribution that has this
property. Conditional independence is a concept of central importance in
probability and statistics with a range of applications in various scientific
domains. As such, the statistical task of testing conditional independence has
been extensively studied in various forms within the statistics and
econometrics communities for nearly a century. Perhaps surprisingly, this
problem has not been previously considered in the framework of distribution
property testing and in particular no tester with sublinear sample complexity
is known, even for the important special case that the domains of $X$ and $Y$
are binary.
  The main algorithmic result of this work is the first conditional
independence tester with {\em sublinear} sample complexity for discrete
distributions over $[\ell_1]\times[\ell_2] \times [n]$. To complement our upper
bounds, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds establishing that the
sample complexity of our algorithm is optimal, up to constant factors, for a
number of settings. Specifically, for the prototypical setting when $\ell_1,
\ell_2 = O(1)$, we show that the sample complexity of testing conditional
independence (upper bound and matching lower bound) is
  \[
  \Theta\left({\max\left(n^{1/2}/\epsilon^2,\min\left(n^{7/8}/\epsilon,n^{6/7}/\epsilon^{8/7}\right)\right)}\right)\,.

they generalize extremely well to a test set, while on the other hand they are
extremely sensitive to so-called adversarial perturbations. The extreme
sensitivity of high performance CNNs to adversarial examples casts serious
doubt that these networks are learning high level abstractions in the dataset.
We are concerned with the following question: How can a deep CNN that does not
learn any high level semantics of the dataset manage to generalize so well? The
goal of this article is to measure the tendency of CNNs to learn surface
statistical regularities of the dataset. To this end, we use Fourier filtering
to construct datasets which share the exact same high level abstractions but
exhibit qualitatively different surface statistical regularities. For the SVHN
and CIFAR-10 datasets, we present two Fourier filtered variants: a low
frequency variant and a randomly filtered variant. Each of the Fourier
filtering schemes is tuned to preserve the recognizability of the objects. Our
main finding is that CNNs exhibit a tendency to latch onto the Fourier image
statistics of the training dataset, sometimes exhibiting up to a 28%
generalization gap across the various test sets. Moreover, we observe that
significantly increasing the depth of a network has a very marginal impact on
closing the aforementioned generalization gap. Thus we provide quantitative
evidence supporting the hypothesis that deep CNNs tend to learn surface
statistical regularities in the dataset rather than higher-level abstract
concepts.

This has been attributed to the complexity of deriving explicit forms of the
nonlocal boundary conditions. Thus, the paradoxes in the existing solutions of
the nonlocal field equation have been revealed in recent studies. In the
present study, a new methodology is proposed to easily determine the elastic
nonlocal fields from their local counterparts without solving the field
equation. This methodology depends on the iterative-nonlocal residual approach
in which the sum of the nonlocal fields is treaded as a residual field. Thus,
in this study the corrections of the local-linear elastic fields for the
nonlocal residuals in materials are presented. These corrections are formed
based on the general nonlocal theory. In the context of the general nonlocal
theory, two distinct nonlocal parameters are introduced to form the
constitutive equations of isotropic-linear elastic continua. In this study, it
is demonstrated that the general nonlocal theory outperforms Eringen-nonlocal
theory in accounting for the impacts of the material Poisson ratio on its
mechanics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the
corrections of the local static bending, vibration, and buckling
characteristics of Euler-Bernoulli beams are derived. Via these corrections,
bending, vibration, and buckling behaviors of simple-supported nonlocal
Euler-Bernoulli beams are determined without solving the beams equation of
motion.

merger. It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and
localized to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 Mpc. It has been proposed
that the observed gamma-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an
ultra-relativistic jet launched during the merger, directed away from our line
of sight. The presence of such a jet is predicted from models positing neutron
star mergers as the central engines driving short-hard gamma-ray bursts
(SGRBs). Here we show that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct
signature of an off-axis jet afterglow. While we cannot rule out the existence
of a jet pointing elsewhere, the observed gamma-rays could not have originated
from such a jet. Instead, the radio data requires a mildly relativistic
wide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be the high velocity
tail of the neutron-rich material dynamically ejected during the merger or a
cocoon of material that breaks out when a jet transfers its energy to the
dynamical ejecta. The cocoon scenario can explain the radio light curve of
GW170817 as well as the gamma-rays and X-rays (possibly also ultraviolet and
optical emission), and hence is the model most consistent with the
observational data. Cocoons may be a ubiquitous phenomenon produced in neutron
star mergers, giving rise to a heretofore unidentified population of radio,
ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-ray transients in the local universe.

it away from an isotropic response. Our work provides the first long-timescale

(polaritons) whose delocalization and electromagnetic character allow for novel
modifications in spectroscopy and chemical reactivity of molecular systems.
Recent experiments have demonstrated remarkable distance-independent long-range
energy transfer between molecules strongly coupled to optical microcavity
modes. To shed light on the mechanism of this phenomenon, we present the first
comprehensive theory of polariton-assisted remote energy transfer (PARET) based
on strong-coupling of donor and/or acceptor chromophores to surface plasmons.
Application of our theory demonstrates that PARET up to a micron is indeed
possible via strong-coupling. In particular, we report two regimes for PARET:
in one case, strong-coupling to a single type of chromophore leads to transfer
mediated largely by surface plasmons while in the other case, strong-coupling
to both types of chromophores creates energy transfer pathways mediated by
vibrational relaxation. Importantly, we highlight conditions under which
coherence enhances or deteriorates these processes. For instance, while

transitions among these SF phases. One transition is a first order one driven
by roton droppings ( but with non-zero gaps $ \Delta_R $ ) tuned by the Zeeman
field $ h $. Another is a second order bosonic Lifshitz transition with the
dynamic exponents $ z_x=z_y=2 $ and an accompanying $ [C_4 \times C_4]_D $
symmetry breaking. It is driven by the softening of the superfluid Goldstone
mode tuned by the ratio of spin-orbit coupled (SOC) strength over the hopping
strength. The two phase boundaries meet at a topological tri-critical (TT)
point which separates the $ h=0 $ line into two SF phases with $ N=2 $ and $
N=4 $ condensation momenta respectively. At the $ h=0 $ line where the system
has an anti-unitary $ Z_2 $ Reflection symmetry, there are infinite number of
classically degenerate family of states on both sides. We perform a systematic
order from quantum disorder analysis to find the quantum ground states, also
calculate the roton gaps $ \Delta_R $ generated by the order from disorder
mechanism on both sides of the TT point. The $ N=2 $ and $ N=4 $ SF phases have
the same spin-orbital XY-AFM spin structure, respect the anti-unitary symmetry
and break the $ [C_4 \times C_4]_D $ symmetry, so they be distinguished only by
the different topology of the BEC condensation momenta instead of by any

(LBM) for galactic propagation we have not been able to simultaneously
reproduce the individual He and C nuclei spectra and the large increase in He/C
ratio that is observed at low energies. However, using a truncated LBM with
different truncation parameters for each nucleus that are related to their rate
of energy loss by ionization which is ~Z2/A, these different features can be
matched. This suggests that we are observing the effects of the source
distribution of cosmic rays in the galaxy on the low energy spectra of cosmic
ray nuclei and that there may be a paucity of nearby sources. In this

~dj/dP = P-2.24, the same for each nucleus and also for all rigidities. These

We measure the disk sizes with continuum reverberation mapping using two
methods, both of which are derived from the expectation that accretion disks
have a radial temperature gradient and the continuum emission at a given radius
is well-described by a single blackbody. In the first method we measure the
relative lags between the multiband light curves, which provides the relative
time lag between shorter and longer wavelength variations. From this, we are
only able to constrain upper limits on disk sizes, as many are consistent with
no lag the 2$\sigma$ level. The second method fits the model parameters for the
canonical thin disk directly rather than solving for the individual time lags
between the light curves. Our measurements demonstrate good agreement with the
sizes predicted by this model for accretion rates between 0.3-1 times the
Eddington rate. Given our large uncertainties, our measurements are also
consistent with disk size measurements from gravitational microlensing studies

global obstructions to achieving a fully gapped surface, which typically lead

$E\gtrsim10$ GeV to only a few for $E \gtrsim 500$ GeV. Thus, if pulsars
explain these positrons, the positron energy spectrum should become
increasingly bumpy at higher energies. Here we present a power-spectrum

line galaxies at the absorber redshift, which together form a galaxy group. The
$^{12}$CO emission line detections originate from the most massive galaxy in
this group. While we cannot exclude that we miss a fainter host, we reach a

We measure the dust-corrected SFR (ranging from $3$ to $50$ M$_{\odot}$

Observations of neutron star masses indicate a bimodal Gaussian distribution,
while the observed black hole mass distribution decays exponentially for
stellar-mass black holes. We use these observed distributions to directly
confront the predictions of stellar evolution models and the neutrino-driven
supernova simulations of Sukhbold et al. (2016). We find excellent agreement
between the black hole and low-mass neutron star distributions created by these
simulations and the observations. We show that a large fraction of the stellar
envelope must be ejected, either during the formation of stellar-mass black
holes or prior to the implosion through tidal stripping due to a binary
companion, in order to reproduce the observed black hole mass distribution. We
also determine the origins of the bimodal peaks of the neutron star mass
distribution, finding that the low-mass peak (centered at ~1.4 M_sun)
originates from progenitors with M_zams ~ 9-18 M_sun. The simulations fail to
reproduce the observed peak of high-mass neutron stars (centered at ~1.8 M_sun)

measure the binary fraction of current A/F primaries to be 15.4%$\pm$1.4%,

Despite being often neglected in galaxy formation simulations, spin plays a
crucial role in modulating accretion power, driving jet feedback, and
determining recoil velocity of coalescing black hole binaries. We present a new
accretion model for the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo} that incorporates (i) mass
accretion through a thin $\alpha$-disc, and (ii) spin evolution through the
Bardeen-Petterson effect. We use a diverse suite of idealised simulations to
explore the physical connection between spin evolution and larger scale
environment. We find that black holes with mass $\lesssim 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$
experience quick alignment with the accretion disc. This favours prolonged
phases of spin-up, and the spin direction evolves according to the gas inflow
on timescales as short as $\lesssim 100$ Myr, which might explain the observed
jet direction distribution in Seyfert galaxies. Heavier black holes ($\gtrsim
10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$) are instead more sensitive to the local gas kinematic.
Here we find a wider distribution in spin magnitudes: spin-ups are favoured if
gas inflow maintains a preferential direction, and spin-downs occur for nearly
isotropic infall, while the spin direction does not change much over short
timescales $\sim 100$ Myr. We therefore conclude that supermassive black holes
with masses $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ may be the ideal testbed to
determine the main mode of black hole fuelling over cosmic time.

to the effects of convection.The influence of this inhomogeneity, referred to
as granulation, on colours has never been investigated over a large range of
effective temperatures and gravities. We aim to study, in a quantitative way,
the impact of granulation on colours. We use the CIFIST grid of CO5BOLD
hydrodynamical models to compute emerging fluxes. These in turn are used to
compute theoretical colours in the UBVRI,2MASS,Hipparcos,Gaia and SDSS systems.
Every CO5BOLD model has a corresponding one dimensional (1D) plane-parallel LHD
model computed for the same atmospheric parameters, which we used to define a
""3D correction"" that can be applied to colours computed from fluxes computed
from any 1D model atmosphere code. The 3D corrections on colours are generally
small, of the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude, yet they are far from
negligible. We find that ignoring granulation effects can lead to
underestimation of Teff by up to 200K and overestimation of gravity by up to
0.5dex, when using colours as diagnostics. We have identified a major
shortcoming in how scattering is treated in the current version of the CIFIST
grid, which could lead to offsets of the order 0.01mag, especially for colours
involving blue and UV bands.We have investigated the Gaia and Hipparcos
photometric systems and found that the (G-H_p),(BP-RP) diagram is immune to the
effects of granulation. In addition, we point to the potential of the RVS
photometry as a metallicity diagnostic. Our investigation shows that the
effects of granulation should not be neglected if one wants to use colours as
diagnostics of the stellar parameters of F,G,K stars. A limitation is that
scattering is treated as true absorption in our current computations, thus our
3D corrections are likely an upper limit to the true effect. (Abridged)

excite (or damp) the orbital eccentricity of the planet. In this paper, we
present two long ($t\sim 3\times 10^5$ orbits) numerical simulations: (a) one
(with a relatively light disc, $M_{\rm d}/M_{\rm p}=0.2$) where the
eccentricity initially stalls before growing at later times and (b) one (with a
more massive disc, $M_{\rm d}/M_{\rm p}=0.65$) with fast growth and a late
decrease of the eccentricity. We recover the well-known result that a more
massive disc promotes a faster initial growth of the planet eccentricity.
However, at late times the planet eccentricity decreases in the massive disc
case, but increases in the light disc case. Both simulations show periodic
eccentricity oscillations superimposed on a growing/decreasing trend and a
rapid transition between fast and slow pericentre precession. The peculiar and
contrasting evolution of the eccentricity of both planet and disc in the two
simulations can be understood by invoking a simple toy model where the disc is
treated as a second point-like gravitating body, subject to secular
planet-planet interaction and eccentricity pumping/damping provided by the
disc. We show how the counterintuitive result that the more massive simulation
produces a lower planet eccentricity at late times can be understood in terms
of the different ratios of the disc-to-planet angular momentum in the two
simulations. In our interpretation, at late times the planet eccentricity can
increase more in low-mass discs rather than in high-mass discs, contrary to
previous claims in the literature.

SN Ic identification was confirmed by removing the CSM interaction component
from the spectrum and comparing with known SNe Ic, and reversely, adding a CSM
interaction component to the spectra of known SNe Ic and comparing them to SN
2017dio. Excellent agreement was obtained with both procedures, reinforcing the
SN Ic classification. The light curve constrains the pre-interaction SN Ic peak
absolute magnitude to be around $M_g = -17.6$ mag. No evidence of significant
extinction is found, ruling out a brighter luminosity required by a SN Ia
classification. These pieces of evidence support the view that SN 2017dio is a
SN Ic, and therefore the first firm case of a SN Ic with signatures of
hydrogen-rich CSM in the early spectrum. The CSM is unlikely to have been
shaped by steady-state stellar winds. The mass loss of the progenitor star must
have been intense, $\dot{M} \sim 0.02$ $(\epsilon_{H\alpha}/0.01)^{-1}$
$(v_\textrm{wind}/500$ km s$^{-1}$) $(v_\textrm{shock}/10 000$ km
s$^{-1})^{-3}$ $M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, peaking at a few decades before the SN.
Such a high mass loss rate might have been experienced by the progenitor
through eruptions or binary stripping.

analyze these data is growing at an unprecedented rate. Recent algorithmic
attempts to fill this gap have employed unsupervised tools to discover
structure in data. Some of the most successful approaches have used
probabilistic models to uncover latent thematic structure in discrete data.
Despite the success of these models on textual data, they have not generalized
as well to image data, in part because of the spatial and temporal structure
that may exist in an image stream.
  We introduce a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that
incorporates the ability of convolutional autoencoders to discover features
from images that directly encode spatial information, within a Bayesian
nonparametric topic model that discovers meaningful latent patterns within
discrete data. By using this hybrid framework, we overcome the fundamental
dependency of traditional topic models on rigidly hand-coded data
representations, while simultaneously encoding spatial dependency in our topics
without adding model complexity. We apply this model to the motivating
application of high-level scene understanding and mission summarization for
exploratory marine robots. Our experiments on a seafloor dataset collected by a
marine robot show that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms current
state-of-the-art approaches on the task of unsupervised seafloor terrain
characterization.

It can either process the received tasks from mobile users or offload them to
the cloud. We jointly optimize the offloading decisions of all users, together
with the allocation of computation and communication resources, to minimize the
overall cost of energy consumption, computation, and maximum delay among users.
The joint optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer program. We
show that the problem can be reformulated and transformed into a non-convex
quadratically constrained quadratic program, which is NP-hard in general. We
then propose an efficient solution to this problem by semidefinite relaxation
and a novel randomization mapping method. Furthermore, when there is a strict
delay constraint for processing each user's task, we further propose a
three-step algorithm to guarantee the feasibility and local optimality of the

nearly optimal performance under a wide range of parameter settings, and the

quantum theory that are not amenable to a treatment by perturbation theory.
Most path integral computations require an analytic continuation to imaginary
time. While imaginary time treatments of scattering are possible, imaginary
time is not a natural framework for treating scattering problems. Purpose: To
test a recently introduced method for performing direct calculations of
scattering observables using real-time path integrals. Methods: The
computations are based on a new interpretation of the path integral as the
expectation value of a potential functional on a space of continuous paths with
respect to a complex probability distribution. The method has the advantage
that it can be applied to arbitrary short-range potentials. Results: The new
method is tested by applying it to calculate half-shell sharp-momentum
transition matrix elements for one-dimensional potential scattering. The
calculations for half shell transition operator matrix elements are in
agreement with a numerical solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The
computational method has a straightforward generalization to more complicated
systems.

$\sim0.35$. These results can be explained with the swing-amplification theory.
The condition for the formation of $m=2$ spirals is consistent with that for
the formation of the bar, which is also an $m=2$ phenomenon. We further argue
that the non-barred grand-design spiral galaxies are transitional, and that
they evolve to barred galaxies on a dynamical timescale. We also confirm that
the disk-mass fraction and shear rate are important parameters for the

decades. Determining how likely each of these changes are to have been caused
by human influence, is important for decision making on mitigation and
adaptation policy. Here we describe an approach for deriving the probability
that anthropogenic forcings have caused a given observed change. The proposed
approach is anchored into causal counterfactual theory (Pearl 2009) which has
been introduced recently, and was in fact partly used already, in the context
of extreme weather event attribution (EA). We argue that these concepts are
also relevant, and can be straightforwardly extended to, the context of
detection and attribution of long term trends associated to climate change
(D&A). For this purpose, and in agreement with the principle of
""fingerprinting"" applied in the conventional D&A framework, a trajectory of
change is converted into an event occurrence defined by maximizing the causal
evidence associated to the forcing under scrutiny. Other key assumptions used
in the conventional D&A framework, in particular those related to numerical
models error, can also be adapted conveniently to this approach. Our proposal
thus allows to bridge the conventional framework with the standard causal
theory, in an attempt to improve the quantification of causal probabilities. An
illustration suggests that our approach is prone to yield a significantly
higher estimate of the probability that anthropogenic forcings have caused the
observed temperature change, thus supporting more assertive causal claims.

general backdrop of formal equality of opportunity is a troubling phenomenon
that has significant ramifications on the design of hiring policies. In this
paper, we show that current group disparate outcomes may be immovable even when
hiring decisions are bound by an input-output notion of ""individual fairness.""
Instead, we construct a dynamic reputational model of the labor market that
illustrates the reinforcing nature of asymmetric outcomes resulting from
groups' divergent accesses to resources and as a result, investment choices. To
address these disparities, we adopt a dual labor market composed of a Temporary
Labor Market (TLM), in which firms' hiring strategies are constrained to ensure
statistical parity of workers granted entry into the pipeline, and a Permanent
Labor Market (PLM), in which firms hire top performers as desired. Individual
worker reputations produce externalities for their group; the corresponding
feedback loop raises the collective reputation of the initially disadvantaged
group via a TLM fairness intervention that need not be permanent. We show that
such a restriction on hiring practices induces an equilibrium that, under
particular market conditions, Pareto-dominates those arising from strategies
that statistically discriminate or employ a ""group-blind"" criterion. The
enduring nature of equilibria that are both inequitable and Pareto suboptimal
suggests that fairness interventions beyond procedural checks of hiring
decisions will be of critical importance in a world where machines play a
greater role in the employment process.

a rectifying bipolar nanopore on two modeling levels. In an all-atom model, we
use explicit water to simulate ion transport directly with the molecular
dynamics technique. In a reduced model, we use implicit water and apply the
Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo method together with the Nernst-Planck transport
equation. This hybrid method makes the fast calculation of ion transport
possible at the price of lost details. We show that the implicit-water model is
an appropriate representation of the explicit-water model when we look at the
system at the device (i.e., input vs.\ output) level. The two models produce
qualitatively similar behavior of the electrical current for different voltages
and model parameters. Looking at details of concentration and potential
profiles, we find profound differences between the two models. These
differences, however, do not influence the basic behavior of the model as a
device because they do not influence the $z$-dependence of the concentration
profiles which are the main determinants of current. These results then address
an old paradox: how do reduced models, whose assumptions should break down in a
nanoscale device, predict experimental data? Our simulations show that reduced
models can still capture the overall device physics correctly, even though they
get some important aspects of the molecular-scale physics quite wrong; reduced
models work because they include the physics that is necessary from the point
of view of device function. Therefore, reduced models can suffice for general
device understanding and device design, but more detailed models might be
needed for molecular level understanding.

of the microbiome across a range of environmental contexts [Costello et al.,
2012, Faust et al., 2015]. For example, it is often of interest to identify
time intervals within which certain subsets of taxa have an interesting pattern
of behavior. Viewed abstractly, these problems often have a flavor not just of
time series modeling but also of regime detection, a problem with a rich
history across a variety of applications, including speech recognition [Fox et
al., 2011], finance [Lee, 2009], EEG analysis [Camilleri et al., 2014], and
geophysics [Weatherley and Mora, 2002]. In spite of the parallels, regime
detection methods are rarely used in microbiome analysis, most likely due to
the fact that references for these methods are scattered across several
literatures, descriptions are inaccessible outside limited research
communities, and implementations are difficult to come across.
  We distill the core ideas of different regime detection methods, provide
example applications, and share reproducible code, making these techniques more
accessible to microbiome researchers. We re-analyze data of Dethlefsen and
Relman [2011], a study of the effects of antibiotics on the microbiome, using
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) [Breiman et al., 1984], Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) [Rabiner and Juang, 1986], Bayesian nonparametric HMMs
[Teh and Jordan, 2010, Fox et al., 2008], mixtures of Gaussian Processes (GPs)
[Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2002], switching dynamical systems [Linderman et
al., 2016], and multiple changepoint detection [Fan and Mackey, 2015]. Along
the way, we summarize each method, their relevance to the microbiome, and
tradeoffs associated with using them. Ultimately, our goal is to describe types
of temporal or regime switching structure that can be incorporated into studies

informed and selfish players, and uninformed players. By considering the

how the altruism can impact on the privileged information. We localized

Finally, in an evolutionary version of the game ,we showed that the gain of the

consideration of LET and RBE in normal and tumor tissue dose-effect relations
are usually handled by the linear-quadratic model (LQ). This approximation
excellently works up to the shoulder domain. In particle therapy we have
strictly differ between RBE in the initial plateau and environment of the Bragg
peak. Thus for protons LET and RBE of the initial plateau agree with Co60,
whereas in the Bragg peak domain both properties are increased,, but RBE of
SOBP only varies between 1.1 and 1.17. The RBE of carbon ions is increased once
again Their dose-effect curves are much steeper with a rather small shoulder
domain due to dense ionizing radiation effect. Thus protons are also dense
ionizing in the Bragg peak region, but with rather smaller magnitude compared
to carbon ions. A generalization of the LQ-model based on the nonlinear
reaction-diffusion model is proposed to describe LET and RBE of dense ionizing
particles, which accounts for properties of micro- and nano-dosimetry. A linear
term of a reaction diffusion formula describes the destroy of cells, the
nonlinear term is related to repair and the diffusion term accounts for the
density of the radiation damages. Based on dose-effect properties of Co60 the
parameters of dense ionizing particles can be determined and compared with
measurement data. The local dense of radiation effects and their consequences
in RBE and dose effect curves provide a key of understanding modern therapy
planning with different modalities and properties of nano-dosimetry are
interpreted by mathematical descriptions. The irradiation of spheroids is a
feature of micro-dosimetry, whereas intracellular exposure refers to

homomorphisms for this new filtration. The first term of the Lagrangian
filtration is the Lagrangian mapping class group, whose definition involves a
handlebody bounded by S, and which contains the Torelli group. These
constructions extend in a natural way to the monoid of homology cobordisms.
Besides, D. Cheptea, K. Habiro and G. Massuyeau constructed a functorial
extension of the LMO invariant, called the LMO functor, which takes values in a
category of diagrams. In this paper we give a topological interpretation of the
upper part of the tree reduction of the LMO functor in terms of the

of object's size which is determined by the distance to the detection sensors.
Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising results in many
challenging tasks. The state-of-the-art in object detection is represented by
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as the fast R-CNN algorithm. These
CNN-based methods improve the detection performance significantly on several
public generic object detection datasets. However, their performance on
detecting small objects or undistinguishable objects in visible spectrum images
is still insufficient. In this study, we propose a novel detection algorithm
for military objects by fusing multi-channel CNNs. We combine spatial, temporal
and thermal information by generating a three-channel image, and they will be
fused as CNN feature maps in an unsupervised manner. The backbone of our object
detection framework is from the fast R-CNN algorithm, and we utilize
cross-domain transfer learning technique to fine-tune the CNN model on
generated multi-channel images. In the experiments, we validated the proposed
method with the images from SENSIAC (Military Sensing Information Analysis
Centre) database and compared it with the state-of-the-art. The experimental
results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method on both accuracy

Thus we cover a gap in the literature that has mainly studied the discrete

reasoning are jointly modeled. We start by computing bi-directional optical
flow between the input images using a U-Net architecture. These flows are then
linearly combined at each time step to approximate the intermediate
bi-directional optical flows. These approximate flows, however, only work well
in locally smooth regions and produce artifacts around motion boundaries. To
address this shortcoming, we employ another U-Net to refine the approximated
flow and also predict soft visibility maps. Finally, the two input images are
warped and linearly fused to form each intermediate frame. By applying the
visibility maps to the warped images before fusion, we exclude the contribution
of occluded pixels to the interpolated intermediate frame to avoid artifacts.
Since none of our learned network parameters are time-dependent, our approach
is able to produce as many intermediate frames as needed. We use 1,132 video
clips with 240-fps, containing 300K individual video frames, to train our
network. Experimental results on several datasets, predicting different numbers

examined the effect of focal distance, age, and brightness, within distances of
33.3 to 50 cm, using a custom-built AR haploscope. Experiment I examined the
effect of focal demand, at the levels of collimated (infinite focal distance),
consistent with other depth cues, and at the midpoint of reaching distance.
Observers were too young to exhibit age-related reductions in accommodative
ability. The depth matches of collimated targets were increasingly
overestimated with increasing distance, consistent targets were slightly
underestimated, and midpoint targets were accurately estimated. Experiment II
replicated Experiment I, with older observers. Results were similar to
Experiment I. Experiment III replicated Experiment I with dimmer targets, using
young observers. Results were again consistent with Experiment I, except that
both consistent and midpoint targets were accurately estimated. In all cases,
collimated results were explained by a model, where the collimation biases the
eyes' vergence angle outwards by a constant amount. Focal demand and brightness
affect near-field AR depth matching, while age-related reductions in

orientation dependence in the so-called two-halo regime, up to

approximated by a multiplicative shift of the amplitude and therefore a shift
in the halo bias parameter value. The halo bias from the two-halo term can be
overestimated or underestimated by up to $\sim 30 \%$ depending on the viewing
angle, which translates into the bias in estimated halo masses by up to a
factor of two from halo bias measurements. The orientation dependence at large

choices for the placement of virtual controllers along the cloud-to-things

systems in which real-time control actions are required in response to the
changes in states of an IoT node. In such cases, deploying controller software
on a cloud server is often not tolerable due to delay from the network edge to
the cloud. Hence, it is desirable to trade reliability with latency by moving
controller logic closer to the network edge. Modeling the IoT node as a
dynamical system that evolves linearly in time with quadratic penalty for state
deviations, recursive expressions for the optimum control policy and the
resulting minimum cost value are obtained by taking virtual fog controller
reliability and response time latency into account. Our results indicate that
latency is more critical than reliability in provisoning virtualized control
services over fog endpoints, as it determines the swiftness of the fog control
system as well as the timeliness of state measurements. Based on a realistic

estimations of uncertain model parameters by taking into account a few
observations of a model state. The most reliable methods of MCMC are
computationally expensive. Sequential ensemble methods such as ensemble Kalman
filers and particle filters provide a favourable alternative. However, Ensemble
Kalman Filter has an assumption of Gaussianity. Ensemble Transform Particle
Filter does not have this assumption and has proven to be highly beneficial for
an initial condition estimation and a small number of parameter estimation in
chaotic dynamical systems with non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper we
employ Ensemble Transform Particle Filter (ETPF) and Ensemble Transform Kalman
Filter (ETKF) for parameter estimation in nonlinear problems with 1, 5, and
2500 uncertain parameters and compare them to importance sampling (IS). We
prove that the updated parameters obtained by ETPF lie within the range of an
initial ensemble, which is not the case for ETKF. We examine the performance of
ETPF and ETKF in a twin experiment setup and observe that for a small number of
uncertain parameters (1 and 5) ETPF performs comparably to ETKF in terms of the
mean estimation. For a large number of uncertain parameters (2500) ETKF is
robust with respect to the initial ensemble while ETPF is sensitive due to
sampling error. Moreover, for the high-dimensional test problem ETPF gives an
increase in the root mean square error after data assimilation is performed.
This is resolved by applying distance-based localization, which however
deteriorates a posterior estimation of the leading mode by largely increasing
the variance. A possible remedy is instead of applying localization to use only
leading modes that are well estimated by ETPF, which demands a knowledge at
which mode to truncate.

such that the topological entropy is smaller than $\varepsilon$ (simplicity).
First we will show by means of three examples that for any graph that is not a

transitive (and hence robustly complicate) can be constructed so that the set
of periods is also relatively simple. To numerically measure the complexity of
the set of periods we introduce a notion of a $\textit{boundary of

With the help of the notion of boundary of cofiniteness we can state precisely
what do we mean by extending the entropy simplicity result to the set of

blind albedo estimation in inverse rendering, synthetic aperture radar

been renewed interest in solutions to BGPC with careful analysis of error

sparsity case, via truncated power iteration. Under certain assumptions, the
unknown gains, phases, and the unknown signal can be recovered simultaneously.
Numerical experiments show that power iteration algorithms work not only in the

Si, Fe cores of $(1.82\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, 4.36\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$,
$(1.67\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, 1.99\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ and
$(1.46\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, 1.70\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ respectively, with percent
differences from the model with minimal CBM as large as 86.3%. At the
presupernova stage, the compactness of the stellar cores from O'Connor & Ott
(2011), $\xi_M$, exhibit a range of $(0.120, 0.354)$, suggesting that the
extent of CBM in the advanced burning stages of massive stars is an important
consideration for the explodability and type of compact remnant. The
nucleosynthetic yields from the models, most notably C, O, Ne, Mg and Si are
also significantly affected by the CBM assumptions, showing non-linear trends
with increased mixing. The simulations show that interactions between
convective C, Ne and O shells produce significant non-linear changes in the

particularly interested in personalized models that can account for individual
idiosyncracies, towards identifying phenotypes of menstrual cycles. As a first
step, we consider the hormonal cycle as a set of observations through time. We
use a previously validated mechanistic model to generate realistic hormonal
patterns, and experiment with Gaussian process regression to estimate their
values over time. Specifically, we are interested in the feasibility of
predicting menstrual cycle phases under varying learning conditions: number of

informed vs. agnostic sampling of hormonal measurements. Our results indicate
that Gaussian processes can help model the female menstrual cycle. We discuss
the implications of our experiments in the context of modeling the female

on/off measurements, where an observation potentially containing a new source
or effect (""on"" measurement) is contrasted with a background-only observation
free of the effect (""off"" measurement). In counting experiments, the
significance of the new source or effect can be estimated with a widely-used
formula from [LiMa], which assumes that both measurements are Poisson random
variables. In this paper we study three other cases: i) the ideal case where
the background measurement has no uncertainty, which can be used to study the
maximum sensitivity that an instrument can achieve, ii) the case where the
background estimate $b$ in the off measurement has an additional systematic
uncertainty, and iii) the case where $b$ is a Gaussian random variable instead
of a Poisson random variable. The latter case applies when $b$ comes from a
model fitted on archival or ancillary data, or from the interpolation of a
function fitted on data surrounding the candidate new source/effect.
Practitioners typically use in this case a formula which is only valid when $b$
is large and when its uncertainty is very small, while we derive a general
formula that can be applied in all regimes. We also develop simple methods that
can be used to assess how much an estimate of significance is sensitive to
systematic uncertainties on the efficiency or on the background. Examples of
applications include the detection of short Gamma-Ray Bursts and of new X-ray

distribution is a consequence of junction formation by dislocations on

exponentially with the number of particles. This scaling clearly limits our
ability to do tomography to systems with no more than a few qubits and has been
used to argue against the universal validity of quantum mechanics itself.
However, from a computational learning theory perspective, it can be shown
that, in a probabilistic setting, quantum states can be approximately learned
using only a linear number of measurements. Here we experimentally demonstrate
this linear scaling in optical systems with up to 6 qubits. Our results
highlight the power of computational learning theory to investigate quantum
information, provide the first experimental demonstration that quantum states
can be ""probably approximately learned"" with access to a number of copies of
the state that scales linearly with the number of qubits, and pave the way to
probing quantum states at new, larger scales.

for their abilities of obtaining supersensitive and superresolved measurements
for simultaneous multiple-phase estimation. In this paper, four different
methods of generating multi-mode NOON states with high photon number are
proposed. The first method is a linear optical approach that makes use of the
Fock state filtration to reduce lower-order Fock state terms from the coherent
state inputs, which are jointly combined to produce a multi-mode NOON state
with the triggering of single-photon coincidence detections (SPCD) and
appropriate postselection. The other three methods (two linear and one
nonlinear) use N photon Fock states as the inputs and require SPCD triggering
only. All of the four methods can theoretically create a multi-mode NOON state
with arbitrary photon number. Comparisons among these four methods were made
with respect to the feasibility and efficiency. The first method is
experimentally most feasible since it takes considerably fewer photonic
operations and, more importantly, requires neither the use of high-N Fock
states nor high-degree of nonlinearity.

with discontinuous coefficients are analyzed with respect to the formation of
numerical artifacts. In addition to the degeneracy and self-sharpening of the
GPME with continuous coefficients, detailed in [1], increased numerical
challenges occur in the discontinuous coefficients case. These numerical
challenges manifest themselves in spurious temporal oscillations in second
order finite volume discretizations with both arithmetic and harmonic
averaging. The integral average, developed in [2] leads to improved solutions
with monotone and reduced amplitude temporal oscillations. In this paper, we
propose a new method called the Shock-Based Averaging Method (SAM) that
incorporates the shock position into the numerical scheme. The shock position
is numerically calculated by discretizing the theoretical speed of the front
from the GPME theory. The speed satisfies the jump condition for integral
conservation laws. SAM results in a non-oscillatory temporal profile, producing
physically valid numerical results. We use SAM to demonstrate that the choice
of averaging alone is not the cause of the oscillations, and that the shock
position must be a part of the numerical scheme to avoid the artifacts.

research has received increasing attention. As an extension of image hashing
techniques, traditional video hashing methods mainly depend on hand-crafted
features and transform the real-valued features into binary hash codes. As
videos provide far more diverse and complex visual information than images,
extracting features from videos is much more challenging than that from images.
Therefore, high-level semantic features to represent videos are needed rather
than low-level hand-crafted methods. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural
network is proposed to extract high-level semantic features and a binary hash
function is then integrated into this framework to achieve an end-to-end
optimization. Particularly, our approach also combines triplet loss function
which preserves the relative similarity and difference of videos and
classification loss function as the optimization objective. Experiments have
been performed on two public datasets and the results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art video

interactions during movement. Such interactions, which we refer to as active

experimentally and numerically study the effects of active collisions on a
laterally-undulating sensory-deprived robophysical model, whose dynamics are
applicable to self-propelled systems across length scales and environments. The
robot moves via spatial undulation of body segments, with a nearly-linear
center-of-geometry trajectory. Interactions with a single rigid post scatter
the robot, and these deflections are proportional to the head-post contact
duration. The distribution of scattering angles is smooth and strongly-peaked
directly behind the post. Interactions with a single row of evenly-spaced posts
(with inter-post spacing $d$) produce distributions reminiscent of far-field
diffraction patterns: as $d$ decreases, distinct secondary peaks emerge as
large deflections become more likely. Surprisingly, we find that the presence
of multiple posts does not change the nature of individual collisions; instead,
multi-modal scattering patterns arise from multiple posts altering the
likelihood of individual collisions to occur. As $d$ decreases, collisions near
the leading edges of the posts become more probable, and we find that these
interactions are associated with larger deflections. Our results, which
highlight the surprising dynamics that can occur during active collisions of
self-propelled systems, can inform control principles for locomotors in complex

is to provide insights on large-scale knowledge market failures through an

models on a large empirical dataset to analyze the dynamics of content
generation in knowledge markets. Amongst these, the Cobb-Douglas model best
explains empirical data and provides an intuitive explanation for content
generation through concepts of elasticity and diminishing returns. Content
generation depends on user participation and also on how specific types of
content (e.g. answers) depends on other types (e.g. questions). We show that
these factors of content generation have constant elasticity---a percentage
increase in any of the inputs leads to a constant percentage increase in the
output. Furthermore, markets exhibit diminishing returns---the marginal output
decreases as the input is incrementally increased. Knowledge markets also vary
on their returns to scale---the increase in output resulting from a
proportionate increase in all inputs. Importantly, many knowledge markets
exhibit diseconomies of scale---measures of market health (e.g., the percentage
of questions with an accepted answer) decrease as a function of number of
participants. The implications of our work are two-fold: site operators ought
to design incentives as a function of system size (number of participants); the
market lens should shed insight into complex dependencies amongst different
content types and participant actions in general social networks.

due to [Braunstein and Kimble, Phys. Rev. Lett., 80(4):869, 1998], it is often
loosely stated that this protocol converges to a perfect teleportation of an
input state in the limit of ideal squeezing and ideal detection, but the exact
form of this convergence is typically not clarified. In this paper, I
explicitly clarify that the convergence is in the strong sense, and not the
uniform sense, and furthermore, that the convergence occurs for any input state
to the protocol, including the infinite-energy Basel states defined and
discussed here. I also prove, in contrast to the above result, that the
teleportation simulations of pure-loss, thermal, pure-amplifier, amplifier, and
additive-noise channels converge both strongly and uniformly to the original
channels, in the limit of ideal squeezing and detection for the simulations.
For these channels, I give explicit uniform bounds on the accuracy of their
teleportation simulations. I then extend these uniform convergence results to
particular multi-mode bosonic Gaussian channels. These convergence statements
have important implications for mathematical proofs that make use of the
teleportation simulation of bosonic Gaussian channels, some of which have to do
with bounding their non-asymptotic secret-key-agreement capacities. As a
byproduct of the discussion given here, I confirm the correctness of the proof
of such bounds from my joint work with Berta and Tomamichel from [Wilde,
Tomamichel, Berta, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63(3):1792, March 2017].
Furthermore, I show that it is not necessary to invoke the energy-constrained
diamond distance in order to confirm the correctness of this proof.

Information, i.e., CSI) enable a new behavior recognition paradigm, which is
able to recognize behaviors in a device-free and non-intrusive manner. In this
article, we first provide an overview of the basics of Wi-Fi CSI based behavior
recognition. Afterwards, we classify related applications into
three-granularity: signals, actions and activities, and then provide some
insights for designing new schemes. Finally, we conclude by discussing the
challenges, possible solutions to these challenges and some open issues

unknown cosmic large-scale structure. The MML method is free of binning and
natively accounts for small number statistics and non-detections. Its fast
implementation in the R-package ""dftools"" is equally applicable to other
objects, such as haloes, groups and clusters, as well as observables other than

functions, e.g. a Choloniewski function for the galaxy mass-angular momentum
distribution, also handled by dftools. The code provides uncertainties and
covariances for the fitted model parameters and approximate Bayesian evidences.
We use numerous mock surveys to illustrate and test the MML method, as well as

graph domination parameterized by the nonnegative integers $t$ and $r$. In this
setting, we say that the signal a vertex $v\in V$ receives from a tower of
strength $t$ located at vertex $T$ is defined by $sig(v,T)=max(t-dist(v,T),0)$.
Then a $(t,r)$ broadcast dominating set on $G$ is a set $S\subseteq V$ such
that the sum of all signal received at each vertex $v \in V$ is at least $r$.
In this paper, we consider $(t,r)$ broadcasts of the infinite grid and present
a Python program to compute upper bounds on the minimal density of a $(t,r)$
broadcast on the infinite grid. These upper bounds allow us to construct
counterexamples to a conjecture by Blessing et al. that the $(t,r)$ and $(t+1,

reconnection experiments. Second, we simulate recent experiments on
collisionless magnetized shock generation, by expanding a piston plasma into a
pre-magnetized ambient plasma. For parameters considered, the Biermann effect
generates additional magnetic fields in the curved shock front and thereby
increases shock particle reflection. Both cases show the importance of kinetic
processes in the interaction of plasmas with magnetic fields, and open
opportunities to benchmark these important processes through comparison of

stabilized by a Marangoni flow due to the non-uniformity of the components'
concentrations between the border and the center of the droplet, itself a
result of evaporation. These self-contracting droplets have unusual properties
such as absence of pinning and the ability to move under an external humidity
gradient. The droplets' apparent contact angle is a function of their
concentration and the external humidity. Here we study the motion of such
droplets sliding down slopes, how they deform when moving at large speeds, and
compare the results to normal non-volatile droplets. We precisely control the
external humidity and explore the influence of the volume, viscosity, surface
tension, and contact angle. We find that the droplets suffer a negligible
pinning force so that for small velocities the capillary number ($\mathrm{Ca}$)
is directly proportional to the Bond number ($\mathrm{Bo}$):
$\mathrm{Ca}=\mathrm{Bo} \sin\alpha$ with $\alpha$ the angle of the slope. When
the droplets move at larger velocities they deform when Ca exceeds a threshold,
and deposit smaller droplets when $\mathrm{Ca}$ reaches twice this threshold.

metallicity delta Scuti stars (HADS) at periods less than 0.3 days, where
photometric discrimination between RRc and delta Scuti stars has proven to be
problematic. We offer a spectroscopic discriminant, the well-marked
overabundance of heavy elements, principally [Ba/H], that is a common, if not
universal, characteristic of HADS of all periods and axial rotations. No bona
fide RRc stars known to us have verified heavy-element overabundances. Three
out of 34 stars in our sample with [Fe/H] > -0.7 exhibit anomalously strong
features of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and many rare earths. However, carbon is not
enhanced in these three stars, and we conclude that their elevated n-capture
abundances have not been generated in interior neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.
Contamination by HADS appears to be unimportant, and metal-rich RRc stars occur
in approximately the same proportion in the Galactic field as do metal-rich
RRab stars. An apparent dearth of metal-rich RRc is probably a statistical
fluke. Finally we show that RRc stars have a similar inverse period-metallicity

$(\mathcal{C},t)$ saturated graph. Let $\mathcal{C}_r(H)$ be the family
consisting of every edge-colored copy of $H$ which uses exactly $r$ colors.
  In this paper we consider a variety of colored saturation problems. We
determine the order of magnitude for $\mathrm{sat}_t(n, \mathcal{C}_r(K_k))$
for all $r$, showing a sharp change in behavior when $r\geq \binom{k-1}{2}+2$.
A particular case of this theorem proves a conjecture of Barrus, Ferrara,
Vandenbussche, and Wenger. We determine $\mathrm{sat}_t(n, \mathcal{C}_2(K_3))$
exactly and determine the extremal graphs. Additionally, we document some
interesting irregularities in the colored saturation function.

in a machine learning framework. To do this, we first build the CNN using as an
input a cross-similarity matrix generated from a pair of songs. We then
construct the data set composed of cover song pairs and non-cover song pairs,
which are used as positive and negative training samples, respectively. The
trained CNN outputs the probability of being in the cover song relation given a
cross-similarity matrix generated from any two pieces of music and identifies
the cover song by ranking on the probability. Experimental results show that
the proposed algorithm achieves performance better than or comparable to the

continuous speech. Speech is largely produced during exhalation. In order to
replenish air in the lungs, speakers must periodically inhale. When inhalation
occurs in the midst of continuous speech, it is generally through the mouth.
Intra-speech breathing behavior has been the subject of much study, including
the patterns, cadence, and variations in energy levels. However, an often
ignored characteristic is the {\em sound} produced during the inhalation phase
of this cycle. Intra-speech inhalation is rapid and energetic, performed with
open mouth and glottis, effectively exposing the entire vocal tract to enable
maximum intake of air. This results in vocal tract resonances evoked by
turbulence that are characteristic of the speaker's speech-producing apparatus.
Consequently, the sounds of inhalation are expected to carry information about
the speaker's identity. Moreover, unlike other spoken sounds which are subject
to active control, inhalation sounds are generally more natural and less
affected by voluntary influences. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that
breath sounds are indeed bio-signatures that can be used to identify speakers.
We show that these sounds by themselves can yield remarkably accurate speaker
recognition with appropriate feature representations and classification
frameworks.

Usually the HCAF undergoes a fast decaying kinetic stage followed by a long,
slowly decaying hydrodynamic tail. In a finite range of the system size, we
find that whether the system follows the Fourier law depends on whether the

We reveal that deformation of bismuth surface bands is directly correlated with
vertical charge-density profiles at each electronic state of bismuth. In

has been studied for conventional global shutter cameras for decades. However,
recently, a rolling shutter camera has been widely used due to its low cost
imaging capability and, since the rolling shutter camera captures the image
line-by-line, the relative pose estimation of a rolling shutter camera is more
difficult than that of a global shutter camera. In this paper, we propose to
exploit inertial measurements (gravity and angular velocity) for the rolling
shutter relative pose estimation problem. The inertial measurements provide
information about the partial relative rotation between two views (cameras) and
the instantaneous motion that causes the rolling shutter distortion. Based on
this information, we simplify the rolling shutter relative pose estimation
problem and propose effective methods to solve it. Unlike the previous methods,
which require 44 (linear) or 17 (nonlinear) points with the uniform rolling
shutter camera model, the proposed methods require at most 9 or 11 points to
estimate the relative pose between the rolling shutter cameras. Experimental
results on synthetic data and the public PennCOSYVIO dataset show that the
proposed methods outperform the existing methods.

improvement for large scale object detection. However, in general, the
detection performance usually decreases as the object classes to be detected
increases, and it is a practically challenging problem to train a dominant
model for all classes due to the limitations of detection models and datasets.
In most cases, therefore, there are distinct performance differences of the
modern convolutional detectors for each object class detection. In this paper,
in order to build an ensemble detector for large scale object detection, we
present a conceptually simple but very effective class-wise ensemble detection
which is named as Rank of Experts. We first decompose an intractable problem of
finding the best detections for all object classes into small subproblems of
finding the best ones for each object class. We then solve the detection
problem by ranking detectors in order of the average precision rate for each
class, and then aggregate the responses of the top ranked detectors (i.e.
experts) for class-wise ensemble detection. The main benefit of our method is
easy to implement and does not require any joint training of experts for
ensemble. Based on the proposed Rank of Experts, we won the 2nd place in the
ILSVRC 2017 object detection competition.

significant further development in modern bacterial physiology. Specifically,
Section 4 presents the history and current progress of the `adder' principle of
cell size homeostasis. Section 5 discusses the implications of coarse-graining
the cellular protein composition, and how the coarse-grained proteome `sectors'
re-balance under different growth conditions. Section 6 focuses on
physiological invariants, and explains how they are the key to understanding
the coordination between growth and the cell cycle underlying cell size control
in steady-state growth. Section 7 overviews how the temporal organization of
all the internal processes enables balanced growth. In the final Section 8, we
conclude by discussing the remaining challenges for the future in the field.

homomorphisms to $H$) asks: given a graph $G$ and two $H$-colourings $\varphi$
and $\psi$ of $G$, does there exist a sequence $f_0,\dots,f_m$ of
$H$-colourings such that $f_0=\varphi$, $f_m=\psi$ and $f_i(u)f_{i+1}(v)\in
E(H)$ for every $0\leq i<m$ and $uv\in E(G)$? If the graph $G$ is loop-free,
then this is the equivalent to asking whether it possible to transform
$\varphi$ into $\psi$ by changing the colour of one vertex at a time such that
all intermediate mappings are $H$-colourings. In the affirmative, we say that
$\varphi$ reconfigures to $\psi$. Currently, the complexity of deciding whether
an $H$-colouring $\varphi$ reconfigures to an $H$-colouring $\psi$ is only
known when $H$ is a clique, a circular clique, a $C_4$-free graph, or in a few
other cases which are easily derived from these. We show that this problem is
PSPACE-complete when $H$ is an odd wheel.
  An important notion in the study of reconfiguration problems for
$H$-colourings is that of a frozen $H$-colouring; i.e. an $H$-colouring
$\varphi$ such that $\varphi$ does not reconfigure to any $H$-colouring $\psi$
such that $\psi\neq \varphi$. We obtain an explicit dichotomy theorem for the
problem of deciding whether a given graph $G$ admits a frozen $H$-colouring.
The hardness proof involves a reduction from a CSP problem which is shown to be
NP-complete by establishing the non-existence of a certain type of
polymorphism.

end-to-end mapping from observed data to the ground-truth. Inspired by the
splitting strategy widely used in regularized iterative algorithm to tackle
inverse problems, the mapping is decomposed into two networks, with one
handling the inversion of the physical forward model associated with the data
term and one handling the denoising of the output from the former network,
i.e., the inverted version, associated with the prior/regularization term. The
two networks are trained jointly to learn the end-to-end mapping, getting rid
of a two-step training. The training is annealing as the intermediate variable

framework for optimal development of subsurface resources. CLFD involves three
major steps: 1) optimization of full development plan based on current set of
models, 2) drilling new wells and collecting new spatial and temporal
(production) data, 3) model calibration based on all data. This process is
repeated until the optimal number of wells is drilled. This work introduces an
efficient CLFD implementation for complex systems described by multipoint
geostatistics (MPS). Model calibration is accomplished in two steps:
conditioning to spatial data by a geostatistical simulation method, and
conditioning to production data by optimization-based PCA. A statistical
procedure is presented to assess the performance of CLFD. Methodology is
applied to an oil reservoir example for 25 different true-model cases.
Application of a single-step of CLFD, improved the true NPV in 64%--80% of
cases. The full CLFD procedure (with three steps) improved the true NPV in 96%
of cases, with an average improvement of 37%.

non-thermal from the delocalized phase which is ergodic and thermal. The range
of the delocalized regime increases with increase in the strength of $\Gamma$
and eventually for $\Gamma$ larger than $\Gamma_{CP}$ the entire many-body
spectrum is delocalized. We show that the Renyi entropy is almost independent
of the system size in the MBL phase, hinting towards an area law in this
infinite range model while the delocalized phase shows volume law scaling of
Renyi entropy. We further obtain spin glass transition curve in energy density
$\epsilon$-$\Gamma$ plane from the collapse of eigenstate spin susceptibility.
We demonstrate that in most of the parameter regime SG transition occurs close
to the MBL transition indicating that the SG phase is non-ergodic and
non-thermal while the paramagnetic phase is delocalized and thermal.

variables lies at the heart of statistical learning and signal processing.
Without structural assumptions, such as modeling the variables as a Markov
chain, tree, or other graphical model, joint PMF estimation is often considered
mission impossible - the number of unknowns grows exponentially with the number
of variables. But who gives us the structural model? Is there a generic,
`non-parametric' way to control joint PMF complexity without relying on a
priori structural assumptions regarding the underlying probability model? Is it
possible to discover the operational structure without biasing the analysis up
front? What if we only observe random subsets of the variables, can we still
reliably estimate the joint PMF of all? This paper shows, perhaps surprisingly,
that if the joint PMF of any three variables can be estimated, then the joint
PMF of all the variables can be provably recovered under relatively mild
conditions. The result is reminiscent of Kolmogorov's extension theorem -
consistent specification of lower-dimensional distributions induces a unique
probability measure for the entire process. The difference is that for
processes of limited complexity (rank of the high-dimensional PMF) it is
possible to obtain complete characterization from only three-dimensional
distributions. In fact not all three-dimensional PMFs are needed; and under
more stringent conditions even two-dimensional will do. Exploiting multilinear
algebra, this paper proves that such higher-dimensional PMF completion can be
guaranteed - several pertinent identifiability results are derived. It also
provides a practical and efficient algorithm to carry out the recovery task.
Judiciously designed simulations and real-data experiments on movie

factor of two in measured $\sigma_p$ at fixed richness. We extend our analysis
to HeCS-red-ext, a sample that includes several clusters selected by X-ray flux

similar intrinsic scatter, but the range of $\sigma_p$ at fixed richness

estimates $P_{mem}$ for individual galaxies provided by redMaPPer. The
spectroscopic membership fraction is larger than $P_{mem}$ for $0.05\leq
P_{mem}\leq 0.7$; conversely, it is smaller than $P_{mem}$ at $P_{mem}\geq

use the ELEvoHI model for CME arrival prediction together with an ensemble
approach to derive uncertainties in the modeled arrival time and impact speed.
The CME from 3 November 2010 is analyzed by performing 339 model runs that are
compared to in situ measurements from lined-up spacecraft MESSENGER and
STEREO-B. Remote data from STEREO-B showed the CME as halo event, which is
comparable to an HI observer situated at L1 and observing an Earth-directed

distributions of four ELEvoHI output parameters, drag parameter, background
solar wind speed, initial distance and speed. In this case study, the most
frequent values of these outputs lead to the predictions with the smallest
errors. Restricting the ensemble to those runs, we are able to reduce the mean
absolute arrival time error from $3.5 \pm 2.6$ h to $1.6 \pm 1.1$ h at 1 AU.

the field of reinforcement learning. The family of estimator algorithms is
proposed to improve the convergence rate of LA and has made great achievements.
However, the estimators perform poorly on estimating the reward probabilities
of actions in the initial stage of the learning process of LA. In this
situation, a lot of rewards would be added to the probabilities of non-optimal
actions. Thus, a large number of extra iterations are needed to compensate for
these wrong rewards. In order to improve the speed of convergence, we propose a
new P-model absorbing learning automaton by utilizing a double competitive
strategy which is designed for updating the action probability vector. In this
way, the wrong rewards can be corrected instantly. Hence, the proposed Double
Competitive Algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of existing estimator algorithms.
A refined analysis is presented to show the $\epsilon-optimality$ of the
proposed scheme. The extensive experimental results in benchmark environments
demonstrate that our proposed learning automata perform more efficiently than
the most classic LA $SE_{RI}$ and the current fastest LA $DGCPA^{*}$.

for ghosts of departed quantifiers to provide a Weierstrassian account for
Leibniz's infinitesimals. Euler similarly had notions of equality up to
negligible terms, of which he distinguished two types: geometric and
arithmetic. Euler routinely used product decompositions into a specific
infinite number of factors, and used the binomial formula with an infinite
exponent. Such procedures have immediate hyperfinite analogues in Robinson's

by means of paraphrases departing significantly from Euler's own presentation.
Cauchy gives lucid definitions of continuity in terms of infinitesimals that
find ready formalisations in Robinson's framework but scholars working in a
Weierstrassian framework bend over backwards either to claim that Cauchy was
vague or to engage in a quest for ghosts of departed quantifiers in his work.
Cauchy's procedures in the context of his 1853 sum theorem (for series of
continuous functions) are more readily understood from the viewpoint of
Robinson's framework, where one can exploit tools such as the pointwise

may be feasible. We then investigate the thermal state of the intergalactic

that at k~5h/Mpc the suppression on the matter power spectrum induced by
M_nu=0.1 eV neutrinos can reach ~4% at z~3 when compared to a massless neutrino
cosmology, and ~10% if a massless sterile neutrino is included; surprisingly,
we also find good agreement (~2%) with some analytic predictions. For the 1D
flux power spectrum, the highest response to free-streaming effects is achieved
at k~0.005 s/km when M_nu=0.1 eV; this k-limit falls in the Lyman-Alpha forest

applications as diverse as mechanical design, assembly automation, robot motion
planning, micro- and nano-fabrication, protein-ligand binding, and rational
drug design. However, the current challenge lies in the lack of a general
mathematical formulation that applies to objects of arbitrary shape. We propose
that a measure of shape complementarity can be obtained from the extent of
approximate overlap between shape skeletons. A space-continuous implicit
generalization of the skeleton, called the skeletal density function (SDF) is
defined over the Euclidean space that contains the individual assembly
partners. The SDF shape descriptors capture the essential features that are
relevant to proper contact alignment, and are considerably more robust than the
conventional explicit skeletal representations. We express the shape
complementarity score as a convolution of the individual SDFs. The problem then
breaks down to a global optimization of the score over the configuration space
of spatial relations, which can be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier
transforms (FFTs) on nonequispaced samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the scoring approach for several examples from 2D peg-in-hole alignment to more
complex 3D examples in mechanical assembly and protein docking. We show that
the proposed method is reliable, inherently robust against small perturbations,
and effective in steering gradient-based optimization.

  figure; 9 tables; 6 listings",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often have usage constraints, such
as restrictions on call order or call conditions. API misuses, i.e., violations
of these constraints, may lead to software crashes, bugs, and vulnerabilities.
Though researchers developed many API-misuse detectors over the last two
decades, recent studies show that API misuses are still prevalent. Therefore,
we need to understand the capabilities and limitations of existing detectors in
order to advance the state of the art. In this paper, we present the first-ever
qualitative and quantitative evaluation that compares static API-misuse
detectors along the same dimensions, and with original author validation. To
accomplish this, we develop MUC, a classification of API misuses, and
MUBenchPipe, an automated benchmark for detector comparison, on top of our
misuse dataset, MUBench. Our results show that the capabilities of existing
detectors vary greatly and that existing detectors, though capable of detecting
misuses, suffer from extremely low precision and recall. A systematic
root-cause analysis reveals that, most importantly, detectors need to go beyond
the naive assumption that a deviation from the most-frequent usage corresponds
to a misuse and need to obtain additional usage examples to train their models.
We present possible directions towards more-powerful API-misuse detectors.

multiplexing (LDM) systems for enlarging the spectral efficiency over
broadcasting transmission. Firstly, the SM aided LDM (SM-LDM) system is
proposed, in which different layered services utilize SM for terrestrial
broadcasting transmission with different power levels. Then a spectral
efficiency (SE) analysis framework for SM-LDM systems is proposed, which is
suitable for the SM-LDM systems with linear combining. Moreover, the
closed-form SE lower bound of SM-LDM systems with maximum ratio combining (MRC)
is derived, which is based on this framework. Since the theoretical SE analysis
of single transmit antenna (TA) LDM systems with MRC and spatial multiplexing
(SMX) aided LDM systems with MRC lacks a closed-form expression, the
closed-form SE is also derived for these systems. Monte Carlo simulations are
provided to verify the tightness of our proposed SE lower bound. Furthermore,
it can be shown via simulations that our proposed SM-LDM systems always have a
better SE performance than single-TA LDM systems, which can even outperform the
SE of SMX aided LDM (SMX-LDM) systems.

machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of convolution neural

opposite situation where d is greater than N. In these situations, applying DL
techniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting.
Thus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results
on these tasks. In this paper, we show how to apply CNNs on data which do not
have originally an image structure (in particular on metagenomic data). Our
first contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way
to 1D or 2D images. Based on this representation, we then apply a CNN, with the
aim of predicting various diseases. The proposed approach is applied on six
different datasets including in total over 1000 samples from various diseases.
This approach could be a promising one for prediction tasks in the

deciding whether $\rho$ is $\rho_{t_0}$ or$\rho_{t_0+\Delta t}$ We show the
process of optimization of this hypotheses testing and the condition that
discrimination between the two states become difficult even when optimized test
was executed. In addition, We consider time-enegy uncertainty relation from the
viewpoint of optimized hypotheses testing. Optimization consists of two steps.
The first step is to optimize the decision rule based on the outcome of the
given measurement by the Neyman-Pearson theorem. The second step is to select
optimum measurement in order to maximize the power of test. The optimum
measurement is proved to be $\{ |0\rangle \langle 0|,1-|0\rangle \langle 0|\}$
and the power of test in the optimized test holds
$\gamma_{Max}=1-\exp(-\frac{2n}{\hbar^2}\Delta t^2\Delta H^2)+o(\Delta t^2)$
when $\Delta t \ll 1$ satisfies,where n is the number of the data. It will be
impossible to discriminate between the two states when the power of this test
declines. This condition becomes $\frac{2n}{\hbar^2}\Delta t^2\Delta H^2\ll 1$
in the optimized hypotheses testing.
  It is remarkable that the optimum measurement is composed of the operators
$Q_0$ and $1-Q_0$ in the proof of time-energy uncertainty relation. Namely, the
time-energy uncertainty relation presents the time interval in which even the

the interface significantly modifies the superconducting properties. An
analysis of upper critical fields reveals that near the critical pressure where
AFM order vanishes, the force binding superconducting electron-pairs acquires
an extremely strong-coupling nature. This demonstrates that superconducting
pairing can be tuned non-trivially by magnetic fluctuations (paramagnons)

bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with smooth boundary and $m>1$.
Assuming $m>\frac{4}{3}$ and sufficiently regular nonnegative initial data, we
ensure the existence of global solutions to the no-flux-Dirichlet boundary
value problem for \eqref{star} under a suitable notion of very weak
solvability, which in different variations has been utilized in the literature
before. Comparing this with known results for the fluid-free setting of
\eqref{star} the condition appears to be optimal with respect to global
existence. In case of the stronger assumption $m>\frac{5}{3}$ we moreover
establish the existence of at least one global weak solution in the standard
sense.
  In our analysis we investigate a functional of the form $\int_{\Omega}\!
n^{m-1}+\int_{\Omega}\! c^2$ to obtain a spatio-temporal $L^2$ estimate on
$\nabla n^{m-1}$, which will be the starting point in deriving a series of
compactness properties for a suitably regularized version of \eqref{star}. As
the regularity information obtainable from these compactness results vary
depending on the size of $m$, we will find that taking $m>\frac{5}{3}$ will
yield sufficient regularity to pass to the limit in the integrals appearing in
the weak formulation, while for $m>\frac{4}{3}$ we have to rely on milder
regularity requirements making only very weak solutions attainable.

efforts are focused on detecting pulsars in the vicinity of supermassive black
holes (most notably in our Galactic Centre), enabling pulsar timing to be used
as an extremely precise probe of strong-field gravity. In this paper a
mathematical framework to describe test-particle dynamics in general black hole
spacetimes is presented, and subsequently used to study a binary system
comprising a pulsar orbiting a black hole. In particular, taking into account
the parameterization of a general spherically symmetric black hole metric,
general analytic expressions for both the advance of the periastron and for the
orbital period of a massive test particle are derived. Furthermore, these
expressions are applied to four representative cases of solutions arising in
both general relativity and in alternative theories of gravity. Finally, this
framework is applied to the Galactic Centre $S$-stars and four distinct pulsar
toy models. It is shown that by adopting a fully general-relativistic
description of test-particle motion which is independent of any particular
theory of gravity, observations of pulsars can help impose better constraints
on alternative theories of gravity than is presently possible.

them from straightforwardly doing so. While a number of privacy-preserving

the privacy loss and accuracy gain in their collaboration. In this paper, by
focusing on a two-player setting, we model the collaborative training process
as a two-player game where each player aims to achieve higher accuracy while
preserving the privacy of its own dataset. We introduce the notion of Price of
Privacy, a novel approach for measuring the impact of privacy protection on the
accuracy in the proposed framework. Furthermore, we develop a game-theoretical
model for different player types, and then either find or prove the existence

how two players can make practical use of the proposed theoretical framework,

but with a number of important differences. These include a dependence on the
de Sitter horizon, which may be expressed in terms of the cosmological constant
as $l_{\rm dS} \sim 1/\sqrt{\Lambda}$. Applying the DE-UP to both charged and
neutral particles, we obtain estimates of two limiting mass scales, expressed
in terms of the fundamental constants $\left\{G,c,\hbar,\Lambda, e\right\}$.
Evaluated numerically, the charged particle limit corresponds to the order of
magnitude value of the electron mass ($m_e$), while the neutral particle limit
is consistent with current experimental bounds on the mass of the electron
neutrino ($m_{\nu_e}$). Possible cosmological consequences of the DE-UP are
considered and we note that these lead naturally to a holographic relation
between the bulk and the boundary of the Universe. Low and high energy regimes
in which dark energy effects may dominate canonical quantum behaviour are
identified and the possibility of testing the model using near-future
experiments is briefly discussed.

  We measure the performance of deep convolutional net-based features adapted

applied streak by streak in the transverse plane. Previous fluid dynamical
calculations in Cartesian coordinates with an initial state based on a streak
by streak Yang-Mills field led for peripheral higher energy collisions to large
angular momentum, initial shear flow and significant local vorticity. Recent
experiments verified the existence of this vorticity via the resulting
polarization of emitted $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ particles. At the same
time parton cascade models indicated the existence of more compact initial
state configurations, which we are going to simulate in our approach.
  The proposed model satisfies all the conservation laws including conservation
of a strong initial angular momentum which is present in non-central
collisions. As a consequence of this large initial angular momentum we observe
the rotation of the whole system as well as the fluid shear in the initial
state, which leads to large flow vorticity. Another advantage of the proposed
model is that the initial state can be given in both [t,x,y,z] and $[\tau, x,
y, \eta]$ coordinates, and thus can be tested by all 3+1D hydrodynamical codes
which exist in the field.

message-passing model. {Locally-iterative algorithms} are especially important
in this setting. These are algorithms in which each vertex decides about its
next color only as a function of the current colors in its 1-hop neighborhood.
In STOC'93 Szegedy and Vishwanathan showed that any locally-iterative
(Delta+1)-coloring algorithm requires Omega(Delta log Delta + log^* n) rounds,
unless there is ""a very special type of coloring that can be very efficiently
reduced"" \cite{SV93}. In this paper we obtain this special type of coloring.
Specifically, we devise a locally-iterative (Delta+1)-coloring algorithm with
running time O(Delta + log^* n), i.e., {below} Szegedy-Vishwanathan barrier.
This demonstrates that this barrier is not an inherent limitation for
locally-iterative algorithms. As a result, we also achieve significant
improvements for dynamic, self-stabilizing and bandwidth-restricted settings:
  - We obtain self-stabilizing distributed algorithms for
(Delta+1)-vertex-coloring, (2Delta-1)-edge-coloring, maximal independent set
and maximal matching with O(Delta+log^* n) time. This significantly improves
previously-known results that have O(n) or larger running times \cite{GK10}.
  - We devise a (2Delta-1)-edge-coloring algorithm in the CONGEST model with
O(Delta + log^* n) time and in the Bit-Round model with O(Delta + log n) time.
Previously-known algorithms had superlinear dependency on Delta for
(2Delta-1)-edge-coloring in these models.
  - We obtain an arbdefective coloring algorithm with running time O(\sqrt
Delta + log^* n). We employ it in order to compute proper colorings that
improve the recent state-of-the-art bounds of Barenboim from PODC'15 \cite{B15}
and Fraigniaud et al. from FOCS'16 \cite{FHK16} by polylogarithmic factors.
  - Our algorithms are applicable to the SET-LOCAL model of \cite{HKMS15}.

distributions approximating the posterior. Previous approaches have involved
inverting the dependency structure in a heuristic way that fails to capture
these dependencies correctly, thereby limiting the achievable accuracy of the
resulting approximations. We introduce an algorithm for faithfully, and
minimally, inverting the graphical model structure of any generative model.
Such inverses have two crucial properties: (a) they do not encode any
independence assertions that are absent from the model and; (b) they are local
maxima for the number of true independencies encoded. We prove the correctness
of our approach and empirically show that the resulting minimally faithful

of no unobserved confounders (unconfoundedness assumption). There is, however,
seldom clear subject-matter or empirical evidence for such an assumption. We
therefore develop uncertainty intervals for average causal effects based on
outcome regression estimators and doubly robust estimators, which provide
inference taking into account both sampling variability and uncertainty due to
unobserved confounders. In contrast with sampling variation, uncertainty due
unobserved confounding does not decrease with increasing sample size. The
intervals introduced are obtained by deriving the bias of the estimators due to
unobserved confounders. We are thus also able to contrast the size of the bias
due to violation of the unconfoundedness assumption, with bias due to
misspecification of the models used to explain potential outcomes. This is
illustrated through numerical experiments where bias due to moderate unobserved
confounding dominates misspecification bias for typical situations in terms of
sample size and modeling assumptions. We also study the empirical coverage of
the uncertainty intervals introduced and apply the results to a study of the
effect of regular food intake on health. An R-package implementing the

flux were injected from a point along the edge of a square sample, which at 2.5
K responds by nucleation of a thermomagnetic avalanche. Magneto-optical imaging
was used to show that when such films are cooled in the presence of in-plane
magnetic fields they become anisotropic, and the morphology of the avalanches
change systematically, both with the direction and magnitude of the field. The
images reveal that the avalanching dendrites consistently bend towards the
direction perpendicular to that of the in-plane field. The effect increases
with the field magnitude, and at 1.5 kOe the triggered avalanche becomes
quenched at the nucleation stage. The experimental results are explained based
on a theoretical model for thermomagnetic avalanche nucleation in

a high order spatial discretization is usually needed. Model order reduction
(MOR) techniques are often used to reduce the order of spatially-discretized

techniques are $\mathcal H_2$-optimal methods such as the iterative rational
Krylov subspace algorithm (IRKA) and related schemes. However, these methods
are used to obtain good approximations on a infinite time-horizon. Thus, in
this work, our main goal is to discuss MOR schemes for time-limited linear
systems. For this, we propose an alternative time-limited $\mathcal H_2$-norm
and show its connection with the time-limited Gramians. We then provide
first-order optimality conditions for an optimal reduced order model (ROM) with

satisfying these conditions approximately. Then, we analyze how far away the

decade due to a wealth of data from new facilities. Unbiased dust surveys with
Spitzer leave us with good constraints on the dust dispersal timescale of small
grains in the terrestrial planet forming region. In the ALMA era, this can be
confronted for the first time also with evolutionary timescales of mm grains in
the outer disk. Gas surveys in the context of the existing multi-wavelength
dust surveys will be a key in large statistical studies of disk gas evolution.
Unbiased gas surveys are limited to ALMA CO submm surveys, where the
quantitative interpretation is still debated. Herschel gas surveys have been
largely biased, but [OI] 63 mic surveys and also accretion tracers agree
qualitatively with the evolutionary timescale of small grains in the inner
disk. Recent advances achieved by means of consistent multi-wavelength studies
of gas AND dust in planet forming disks reveal the subtleties of the
quantitative interpretation of gas surveys. Observational methods to determine
disk masses e.g. from CO submm lines require the knowledge of the dust
properties in the disk. Understanding not only the gas evolution, but also its
chemical composition will provide crucial input for planet formation models.
Kinetic chemical results give profoundly different answers than thermodynamic
equilibrium in terms of the C/O ratios as well as the water ice/rock ratios.
Again, dust has a key impact on the chemical evolution and composition of the
gas. Grain growth for example affects freeze-out processes and strongly
increases the cosmic ray induced UV field.

reduces the computational cost and avoids re-encoding the predictions when
generating a sequence of frames, mitigating the propagation of errors.
Furthermore, it is possible to remove layers from an already trained model,
giving an insight to the role performed by each layer and making the model more

Convection is characterized by the formation of vortices and stagnation points,
where the fluid interface is stretched and compressed enhancing mixing. We
analyze the behavior of the mixing dynamics in different scenarios using an
interface deformation model. We show that the scalar dissipation rate, which is
related to the dissolution fluxes, is controlled by interfacial processes,
specifically the equilibrium between interface compression and diffusion, which
depends on the flow field configuration. We consider different scenarios of
increasing complexity. First, we analyze a double-gyre synthetic velocity
field. Second, a Rayleigh-B\'enard instability (the Horton-Rogers-Lapwood
problem), in which stagnation points are located at a fixed interface. This
system experiences a transition from a diffusion controlled mixing to a chaotic
convection as the Rayleigh number increases. Finally, a Rayleigh-Taylor
instability with a moving interface, in which mixing undergoes three different
regimes: diffusive, convection dominated, and convection shutdown. The
interface compression model correctly predicts the behavior of the systems. It
shows how the dependency of the compression rate on diffusion explains the
change in the scaling behavior of the scalar dissipation rate. The model
indicates that the interaction between stagnation points and the correlation
structure of the velocity field is also responsible for the transition between
regimes. We also show the difference in behavior between the dissolution fluxes

peak}$ and $z_{\rm f}$ are the accretion and formation redshifts, respectively.
We find that, at given $z_{\rm peak}$, their MAH is bimodal. Infall halos are
dominated by a young population at high redshift and by an old population at
low redshift. For the young population, the $a_{\rm nf}$ distribution is narrow
and peaks at about $1.2$, independent of $z_{\rm peak}$, while for the old
population, the peak position and width of the $a_{\rm nf}$ distribution both
increases with decreasing $z_{\rm peak}$ and are both larger than those of the
young population. This bimodal distribution is found to be closely connected to
the two phases in the MAHs of halos. While members of the young population are
still in the fast accretion phase at $z_{\rm peak}$, those of the old
population have already entered the slow accretion phase at $z_{\rm peak}$.
This bimodal distribution is not found for the whole halo population, nor is it
seen in halo merger trees generated with the extended Press-Schechter
formalism. The infall halo population at $z_{\rm peak}$ are, on average,
younger than the whole halo population of similar masses identified at the same

cells. However, this response is perilous if T cells are activated by the wrong

eliminated. It is therefore important that T cells get activated only by the
right kind of signals and for the right duration. The dominant theory in

that the two signal requirement induces a novel coherent feedforward motif

of a black hole and Hawking radiation. If Hawking radiation is well
approximated by an outgoing particle generated from pair creation around the
black hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There
should be a unitary mechanism to reduce the number of states inside the horizon
for black hole evaporation. Because the infalling antiparticle has negative
energy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds its partner such that the
two particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a zero energy
system by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model
calculations, we show that such a unitary tracing-out process is only possible
before the Page time while it is impossible after the Page time. Hence, after
the Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking pair
forms a separable state, the internal number of states will monotonically
increase, which is supported by the Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS)
argument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness of the
entire system; hence, the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based
on these results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant
picture. The most important conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity,
semi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity, then the black
hole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time
at the latest; hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be
applied for semi-classical black holes, which seems very problematic.

trans-membrane proteins and key components of the cellular immune system. Upon
recognition of foreign peptides expressed on the MHC-II binding groove, helper
T cells mount an immune response against invading pathogens. Therefore,
mechanistic identification and knowledge of physico-chemical features that
govern interactions between peptides and MHC-II molecules is useful for the
design of effective epitope-based vaccines, as well as for understanding of
immune responses. In this paper, we present a comprehensive trans-allelic
prediction model, a generalized version of our previous biophysical model, that
can predict peptide interactions for all three human MHC-II loci (HLA-DR,
HLA-DP and HLA-DQ), using both peptide sequence data and structural information
of MHC-II molecules. The advantage of this approach over other machine learning
models is that it offers a simple and plausible physical explanation for
peptide-MHC-II interactions. We train the model using a benchmark experimental
dataset, and measure its predictive performance using novel data. Despite its
relative simplicity, we find that the model has comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art method. Focusing on the physical bases of peptide-MHC binding,
we find support for previous theoretical predictions about the contributions of
certain binding pockets to the binding energy. Additionally, we find that
binding pockets P 4 and P 5 of HLA-DP, which were not previously considered as
primary anchors, do make strong contributions to the binding energy. Together,

Hamming space, which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different
modalities. Unsupervised cross-modal hashing is more flexible and applicable
than supervised methods, since no intensive labeling work is involved. However,
existing unsupervised methods learn hashing functions by preserving inter and
intra correlations, while ignoring the underlying manifold structure across
different modalities, which is extremely helpful to capture meaningful nearest
neighbors of different modalities for cross-modal retrieval. To address the
above problem, in this paper we propose an Unsupervised Generative Adversarial
Cross-modal Hashing approach (UGACH), which makes full use of GAN's ability for
unsupervised representation learning to exploit the underlying manifold
structure of cross-modal data. The main contributions can be summarized as
follows: (1) We propose a generative adversarial network to model cross-modal
hashing in an unsupervised fashion. In the proposed UGACH, given a data of one
modality, the generative model tries to fit the distribution over the manifold
structure, and select informative data of another modality to challenge the
discriminative model. The discriminative model learns to distinguish the
generated data and the true positive data sampled from correlation graph to
achieve better retrieval accuracy. These two models are trained in an
adversarial way to improve each other and promote hashing function learning.
(2) We propose a correlation graph based approach to capture the underlying
manifold structure across different modalities, so that data of different
modalities but within the same manifold can have smaller Hamming distance and
promote retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments compared with 6
state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

to the neuron itself after a finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse acts as being
delivered through a fast Cl-type inhibitory synapse. We derive a general
relation which allows calculating exactly the probability density function
(pdf) $p(t)$ of output interspike intervals of a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback and on the properties
of the feedback line (the $\Delta$ value). Similar relations between
corresponding moments are derived. Furthermore, we prove that initial segment
of pdf $p^0(t)$ for a neuron with a fixed threshold level is the same for any
neuron satisfying the imposed conditions and is completely determined by the
input stream. For the Poisson input stream, we calculate that initial segment
exactly and, based on it, obtain exactly the initial segment of pdf $p(t)$ for

model-independent as well. The obtained expressions are checked by means of
Monte Carlo simulation. The course of $p(t)$ has a pronounced peculiarity,
which makes it impossible to approximate $p(t)$ by Poisson or another simple
stochastic process.

the molecular arms. This suggests an influence from the AGN on the CND
molecular gas. There is also absorption against the AGN with a low velocity

(DAMPE), has released its observation data of the cosmic ray (CR) electrons and
positrons. The data shows an excess in the energy spectrum up to TeV energy,
and possibly a peak-like fine structure at $\sim 1.4 \TeV$. We investigate the
scenario that the source of the excess comes from dark matter annihilation or
decay. We find that the annihilation or decay of diffuse dark matter particles
in the Galactic halo can give excellent ($W^+W^-$ channel) or at least good
(double $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel) fits to the broad excess. However, the
annihilation cross-section is $10^{-23}\cm^3s^{-1}$, larger than required for
getting the correct relic abundance. We then study whether the narrow peak at
$\sim 1.4\TeV$ could be explained by a nearby subhalo, which thanks to the
smaller distance, could supply $e^+e^-$ within a narrow energy range. We find
that in order to produce a peak width less than the energy bin width (0.2 TeV),
the source must be located within $r\lsim 0.53~\kpc$. Our global fit models do
not produce the peak-like feature, instead at 1.4 TeV the spectrum show either
a slope or a cliff-like feature. However, if less than optimal fit is allowed,
the peak-like feature could be generated. Furthermore, an excellent fit with
peak could be obtained with model B if the background is rescaled. If the dark
matter decay and annihilation rates are determined using the broad excess, the
required subhalo mass $\sim10^{5}~M_\odot$ for decay model, or
$\sim10^{4.5}\Msun$ for annihilation model and a shallower density profile
slope $\alpha=1.2$, or $\sim10^{2.5}\Msun$ for the steep density profile
$\alpha=1.7$. However, the probability for the existence of a such nearby
subhalo as massive as given above is very low.

of the case, exchange tends to enhance the electron-phonon interaction,
although the motivations for such behaviour are not completely understood. Here
we consider the class of weakly doped two-dimensional multivalley
semiconductors and we demonstrate that a more global picture emerges. In
particular we show that in these systems, at low enough doping, even a moderate
electron-electron interaction enhances the response to any perturbation
inducing a valley polarization. If the valley polarization is due to the
electron-phonon coupling, the electron-electron interaction results in an
enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature. We demonstrate the
applicability of the theory by performing random phase approximation and first
principles calculations in transition metal chloronitrides. We find that
exchange is responsible for the enhancement of the superconducting critical
temperature in Li$_x$ZrNCl and that much larger T$_c$s could be obtained in
intercalated HfNCl if the synthesis of cleaner samples could remove the
Anderson insulating state competing with superconductivity.

both industry and academia, have resulted in the identification of enablers
(Software Defined Networks, Network Function Virtualization, Distributed
Mobility Management, etc.) and critical areas (Mobility management,
Interference management, Joint access-backhaul mechanisms, etc.) that will help
achieve the 5G objectives. During these efforts, it has also been identified
that the 5G networks due to their high degree of heterogeneity, high QoS demand
and the inevitable density (both in terms of access points and users), will
need to have efficient joint backhaul and access mechanisms as well as enhanced
mobility management mechanisms in order to be effective, efficient and
ubiquitous. Therefore, in this paper we first provide a discussion on the
evolution of the backhaul scenario, and the necessity for joint access and
backhaul optimization. Subsequently, and since mobility management mechanisms
can entail the availability, reliability and heterogeneity of the future
backhaul/fronthaul networks as parameters in determining the most optimal
solution for a given context, a study with regards to the effect of future
backhaul/fronthaul scenarios on the design and implementation of mobility
management solutions in 5G networks has been performed.

improving prediction quality from SSIM values of 0.54 to 0.88.

towards the latter, we propose a new setting for VQA where for every question
type, train and test sets have different prior distributions of answers.
Specifically, we present new splits of the VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets, which we
call Visual Question Answering under Changing Priors (VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2
respectively). First, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new
setting and show that their performance degrades significantly compared to the

primarily relying on priors in the training data. Specifically, GVQA explicitly
disentangles the recognition of visual concepts present in the image from the
identification of plausible answer space for a given question, enabling the
model to more robustly generalize across different distributions of answers.
GVQA is built off an existing VQA model -- Stacked Attention Networks (SAN).
Our experiments demonstrate that GVQA significantly outperforms SAN on both
VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. Interestingly, it also outperforms more
powerful VQA models such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) in
several cases. GVQA offers strengths complementary to SAN when trained and

suboptimal policies and training instability. In case (i), we argue that the
terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and thus a
notion of the remaining time should be included as part of the agent's input to
avoid violation of the Markov property. In case (ii), the time limits are not

intersatellite communications (ISC) between two satellites at a large distance
one from another. The main goal of the theory is to formulate all the
navigation observables within the General Relativity Theory. The same approach
should be applied also to the intersatellite GPS-communications (in perspective
also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations). In this
paper a theoretical approach has been developed for ISC between two satellites
moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits, based on the introduction of two
gravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and receiving-signal
satellites. The two null cones account for the variable distance between the
satellites during their uncorrelated motion.The intersection of the two null
cones defines a distance, which can be found from a differential equation in
full derivatives. This distance is the space-time interval in GRT. Applying
some theorems from higher algebra, it was proved that this space-time distance
can become zero, consequently it can be also negative and positive. But in
order to represent the geodesic distance travelled by the signal, the
space-time interval has to be ""compatible"" with the Euclidean distance. So this
""compatibility condition"", conditionally called ""condition for ISC"", is the
most important consequence of the theory. The other important consequence is
that the geodesic distance turns out to be the space-time interval, but with
account also of the ""condition for ISC"". This interpretation enables the strict
mathematical proof that the geodesic distance is greater than the Euclidean
distance - a result, entirely based on the ""two null cones approach"" and
moreover, without any use of the Shapiro delay formulae. Consistency between
several other newly derived numerical parameters is noted.

segmentation in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified deep network
that is able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features.
A video is first divided into equal length clips and next for each clip a set
of tube proposals are generated based on 3D CNN features. Finally, the tube
proposals of different clips are linked together and spatio-temporal action
detection is performed using these linked video proposals. This top-down action
detection approach explicitly relies on a set of good tube proposals to perform
well and training the bounding box regression usually requires a large number
of annotated samples. To remedy this, we further extend the 3D CNN to an
encoder-decoder structure and formulate the localization problem as action
segmentation. The foreground regions (i.e. action regions) for each frame are
segmented first then the segmented foreground maps are used to generate the
bounding boxes. This bottom-up approach effectively avoids tube proposal
generation by leveraging the pixel-wise annotations of segmentation. The
segmentation framework also can be readily applied to a general problem of
video object segmentation. Extensive experiments on several video datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach for action detection and
video object segmentation compared to the state-of-the-arts.

reconstructing perceptual images from brain activities. Analyzing the
correlations of collected data from human brain activities and representing
activity patterns are two problems in brain decoding based on functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. However, existing correlation
analysis methods mainly focus on the strength information of voxel, which
reveals functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex. They tend to neglect
the structural information that implies the intracortical or intrinsic
connections; that is, structural connectivity. Hence, the effective
connectivity inferred by these methods is relatively unilateral. Therefore, we
proposed a correlation network (CorrNet) framework that could be flexibly
combined with diverse pattern representation models. In the CorrNet framework,
the topological correlation was introduced to reveal structural information.
Rich correlations were obtained, which contributed to specifying the underlying
effective connectivity. We also combined the CorrNet framework with a linear
support vector machine (SVM) and a dynamic evolving spike neuron network (SNN)
for pattern representation separately, thus providing a novel method for
decoding cognitive activity patterns. Experimental results verified the
reliability and robustness of our CorrNet framework and demonstrated that the
new method achieved significant improvement in brain decoding over comparable
methods.
