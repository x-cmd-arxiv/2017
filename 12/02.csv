information on the physics of GRBs. The Fermi GBM catalog contains GRB
parameters (peak energy, spectral indices, intensity) estimated fitting the
gamma-ray SED of the total emission (fluence, flnc), and during the time of the
peak flux pflx. Using contingency tables we studied the relationship of the
models best fitting pflx and flnc time intervals. Our analysis revealed an
ordering of the spectra into a power law - Comptonized - smoothly broken power
law - Band series. This result was further supported by a correspondence
analysis (CA) of the pflx and flnc spectra categorical variables. We performed
a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to find a relationship between categorical
(spectral) and model independent physical data. LDA resulted in highly
significant physical differences among the spectral types, that is more
pronounced in the case of the pflx spectra, than for the flnc spectra. We
interpreted this difference as caused by the temporal variation of the spectrum
during the outburst. This spectral variability is confirmed by the differences
in the low energy spectral index and peak energy, between the pflx and flnc
spectra. We found that the synchrotron radiation is significant in GBM spectra.
The mean low energy spectral index is close to the canonical value of {\alpha}
= -2/3 during the peak flux. However, $\alpha$ is ~ -0.9 for the spectra of the
fluences. We interpret this difference as showing that the effect of cooling is
important only for the fluence spectra.

chirality of quarks and induce local parity violation in quantum
chromodynamics. This can lead to observable charge separation along the
direction of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic
effect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the
charge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\Delta\gamma$) is the intrinsic
particle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal
elliptical anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field
direction and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the
$v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two
studies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. (1) The
$\Delta\gamma$ should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au
collisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry
fluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction. However, significant
$\Delta\gamma$ is observed, comparable to the peripheral Au+Au data, suggesting
a background dominance in the latter, and likely also in the mid-central Au+Au
collisions where the multiplicity and $v_{2}$ scaled correlator is similar. (2)
A new approach is devised to study $\Delta\gamma$ as a function of the particle
pair invariant mass ($m_{inv}$) to identify the resonance backgrounds and hence
to extract the possible CME signal. Signal is consistent with zero within
uncertainties at high $m_{inv}$. Signal at low $m_{inv}$, extracted from a
two-component model assuming smooth mass dependence, is consistent with zero
within uncertainties.

started during the first stages of the active region emergence so that its full
evolution from emergence to decay can be simulated. A comparison of the
simulation results with SDO/AIA observations show that many aspects of the
active region's observed coronal evolution are reproduced. In particular, it
shows the presence of a flux rope, which forms at the same location as sheared
coronal loops in the observations. The observations show that eruptions occur

simulation reproduces the first and third eruption, with the simulated flux
rope erupting roughly 1 and 10 hours before the observed ejections,
respectively. A parameter study is conducted where the boundary and initial
conditions are varied along with the physical effects of Ohmic diffusion,
hyperdiffusion and an additional injection of helicity. When comparing the
simulations, the evolution of the magnetic field, free magnetic energy,
relative helicity and flux rope eruption timings do not change significantly.

of bandlimited graph signals, i.e., signals that are sparse in a well-defined
graph Fourier domain. So far, the prior art is mostly focused on (sub)sampling
single snapshots of graph signals ignoring their evolution over time. However,
time can bring forth new insights, since many real signals like sensor
measurements, biological, financial, and network signals in general, have
intrinsic correlations in both domains. In this work, {we fill this lacuna} by
jointly considering the graph-time nature of graph signals, named \emph{graph
processes} for two main tasks: \emph{i)} observability of graph processes; and
\emph{ii)} tracking of graph processes via Kalman filtering; both from a
(possibly time-varying) subset of nodes. A detailed mathematical analysis
ratifies the proposed methods and provides insights into the role played by the
different actors, such as the graph topology, the process bandwidth, and the
sampling strategy. Moreover, (sub)optimal sampling strategies that jointly
exploit the nature of the graph structure and graph process are proposed.
Several numerical tests on both synthetic and real data validate our
theoretical findings and illustrate the performance of the proposed methods in
coping with time-varying graph signals.

note [Hasbestan and Senocak, J. Comput. Phys. vol. 351:473-477 (2017)], we
showed that the data-locality of the Z-order curve in hashed linear octree
generation methods may not be perfect because of potential collisions in the
hash table. Building on that observation, we propose a binarized octree
generation method that complies with the Z-order curve exactly. Similar to a
hashed linear octree generation method, we use Morton encoding to index the
nodes of an octree, but use a red-black tree in place of the hash table.
Red-black tree is a special kind of a binary tree, which we use for insertion
and deletion of elements during mesh adaptation. By strictly working with the
bitwise representation of the octree, we remove computer hardware limitations
on the depth of adaptation on a single processor. Additionally, we introduce a
geometry encoding technique for rapidly tagging the solid geometry for
refinement. Our results for several geometries with different levels of
adaptations show that the binarized octree generation outperforms the linear
octree generation in terms of runtime performance at the expense of only a
slight increase in memory usage. We provide the current AMR capability as
open-source software.

  This paper presents a large scale empirical characterization of
generalization error and model size growth as training sets grow. We introduce
a methodology for this measurement and test four machine learning domains:
machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech
recognition. Our empirical results show power-law generalization error scaling
across a breadth of factors, resulting in power-law exponents---the ""steepness""

improvements only shift the error but do not appear to affect the power-law
exponent. We also show that model size scales sublinearly with data size. These
scaling relationships have significant implications on deep learning research,
practice, and systems. They can assist model debugging, setting accuracy
targets, and decisions about data set growth. They can also guide computing
system design and underscore the importance of continued computational scaling.

dynamics of such a wake are first characterized through the trajectories of the
pressure barycenter over the rear part of the model as well as the
recirculation barycenter in the wake. In particular it is shown that these
dynamics allow the definition of three different states: the two so-called
reflectional symmetry-breaking (RSB) modes and the transient symmetric (TS)
mode. It was shown recently that the time-fluctuations of the pressure
barycenter could be characterized as a weak chaotic system with a well-defined
attractor. We show that the dynamics of the bimodal wake can then be forced
into a stable asymmetric or symmetric state in open loop control, using
tangential continuous or pulsed blowing in three different regions along the
upper edge of the rear part of the model. Finally, a simple closed-loop
opposition control, based on real-time identification of the wake barycenter in
the PIV fields, is used to force the chaotic dynamics of the wake into a
regular oscillatory motion at a well-controlled frequency. Depending on the
actuation parameters, the wake dynamics can also be switched from bimodal to a
new multimodal behavior. We show that this new mode also exhibits a peculiar
dynamics with an up-down instead of left-right chaotic oscillations.
Interestingly, the recirculation area (size of the recirculation bubble) is
much more reduced for the closed-loop experiments when the jets are pulsed
rather than continuous. For the pulsed jets, the reduction is also increased
when the proper frequency is chosen.

successfully identify orphan afterglows from either short or long GRB

washout of lepton asymmetry due to $W_R^\pm$-mediated $\Delta L\neq 0$

theoretically motivated value heuristics (acquisition functions) to guide the

unfortunately, this ideal is difficult to achieve since optimizing acquisition
functions per se is frequently non-trivial. This statement is especially true
in the parallel setting, where acquisition functions are routinely non-convex,
high-dimensional, and intractable. Here, we demonstrate how many popular
acquisition functions can be formulated as Gaussian integrals amenable to the
reparameterization trick and, ensuingly, gradient-based optimization. Further,
we use this reparameterized representation to derive an efficient Monte Carlo
estimator for the upper confidence bound acquisition function in the context of

with the Parkes radio telescope and have identified two extreme scattering
events (ESEs). Towards PSR J1057-5226 we discovered a three-year span of
strengthened scattering during which the variability in flux density and the
scintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the
scattering region is ~23 au, and strong flux density enhancement before and
after the ESE may arise from refractive focusing. Long observations reveal
scintillation arcs characteristic of interference between rays scattered at
large angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest
scattering by a screen 100-200 pc from the earth, perhaps ionized filamentary
structure associated with the boundary of the local bubble(s).
  Towards PSR J1740-3015 we observed a ""double dip"" in the measured flux
density similar to ESEs observed towards compact extragalactic radio sources.
The observed shape is consistent with that produced by a many-au scale
diverging plasma lens with electron density ~500cm$^{-3}$ . The continuing ESE
is at least 1500 d long, making it the longest detected event to date.
  These detections, with materially different observational signatures,
indicate that well-calibrated pulsar monitoring is a keen tool for ESE
detection and ISM diagnostics. They illustrate the strong r\^ole au-scale
non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations and the local ISM structure play in such

their galaxy's face-on disk.
  Here we report on three (collisionless) simulated galaxies displaying

as seen in real galaxies such as IC~5240.
  The same set of quantitative parameters used to measure peanut structures in

agreement is found. In addition, the peanut length grows in tandem with the
bar, and is a maximum at half the length of the bar. Beyond the cutoff of these
peanut structures, towards the end of the bar, we discover a new
positive/negative feature in the $B_6$ radial profile associated with the

studying algorithmic problems; in particular, there is a variety of problems in
computational 3-manifold topology - some of them known to be computationally
hard in general - that become solvable in polynomial time as soon as the dual
graph of the input triangulation has bounded treewidth.
  In view of these algorithmic results, it is natural to ask whether every

not the case, i.e., that there exists an infinite family of closed 3-manifolds
not admitting triangulations of bounded pathwidth or treewidth (the latter
implies the former, but we present two separate proofs).

the topology of a 3-manifold M on the one hand and width-type parameters of the
dual graphs of triangulations of M on the other hand, answering a question that
had been raised repeatedly by researchers in computational 3-manifold topology.
In particular, we show that if a closed, orientable, irreducible, non-Haken

Heegaard genus of M is at most 18(k+1) (resp. 4(3k+1)).

material leftover from the formation of the planets was ejected to the

bodies should also be ejected from other planetary systems and should be
abundant in the interstellar space. The number density of such objects, and
prospects for their detection as they penetrate through the Solar System, were
speculated about for decades, recently rising high hopes with the Pan-STARRS
and LSST surveys. These expectations materialized on 18 October 2017 with the
Pan-STARRS's discovery of 1I/'Oumuamua. Here we report homogeneous photometric
observations of this body from Gemini North, which densely cover a total of 8
hr over two nights. A combined ultra-deep image of 1I/'Oumuamua shows no signs
of cometary activity, confirming the results from earlier, less sensitive
searches. Our data also show an enormous range of brightness variations > 2.5
mag, larger than ever observed in the population of Solar System objects,
suggesting a very elongated shape of the body. But most significantly, the
light curve does not repeat exactly from one rotation cycle to another and its
double-peaked periodicity of 7.5483 $\pm$ 0.0073 hr from our data is
inconsistent with earlier determinations. These are clear signs of a tumbling
motion, a remarkable characteristic of 1I/'Oumuamua's rotation, consistent with
a catastrophic collision in the distant past. This first example of an impacted
minor body of exosolar origin indicates that collisional evolution of minor
body populations in other planetary systems is not uncommon.

drag due to increase in skin friction drag. A critical value of Cauchy number
($Ca$) exists at which the total drag on the plate with respect to a rigid
upright plate is minimum at a given Reynolds number. The reconfigured shape of
the plate for this condition is unique, beyond which the total drag increases
on the plate even with reconfiguration. The ratio of the form drag coefficient
for an upright rigid plate and skin drag coefficient for a horizontal rigid
plate ($\lambda$) determines the critical Cauchy number ($Ca_{cr}$). We propose
modification in the drag scaling with free stream velocity ($F_{x}$ ${\propto}$
$U^{n}$) in presence of the skin friction drag. The following expressions of
$n$ are found for $0.01 \leq Re \leq 1$, $n = 4/5 + {\lambda}/5$ for 1 $\leq$
$Ca$ $<$ $Ca_{cr}$ and $n = 1 + {\lambda}/5$ for $Ca_{cr} \leq Ca \leq 300$,
where $Re$ is Reynolds number. We briefly discuss the combined effect of the
skin friction drag and buoyancy on the drag reduction. An assessment of the
feasibility of experiments is presented in order to translate the present model
to physical systems.

clusters remains unknown. Non-observations of the line in dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs) create tension with galaxy cluster observations when
considering a direct Dark Matter (DM) $\rightarrow \gamma$ decay. This
discrepancy could be explained by a DM $\rightarrow a \rightarrow \gamma$
decay, where the DM particles decay to axion-like particles (ALPs), which then
convert to photons in a magnetic field. The 3.55 keV line from a decay to ALPs
therefore has very different morphology from a direct decay to photons, as it
would only appear in environments with substantial magnetic fields between the
source and us. To test this hypothesis we consider targets where the line
strength would be enhanced compared to the DM $\rightarrow \gamma$ model. The
giant lobes of radio galaxies could represent good environments, having
magnetic fields with strength $\mathcal{O}(\mu\rm{G})$ that extend for hundreds
of kiloparsecs, and minimal X-ray background. In the case of Centaurus A, a
large population of dSphs are associated with the galaxy, some of which are
potentially in or behind its lobes. In this paper we estimate the flux of a
3.55 keV DM $\rightarrow a \rightarrow \gamma$ line from these sources, and
compare it to the flux from the DM halo of Centaurus~A. We comment on the
potential to detect such a signal with current satellites (such as XMM-Newton

circumstellar disk), or if they represent the low-mass tail of the star
formation process. In this study we utilize high-resolution spectroscopy to
measure rotation rates of three young (2-300 Myr) planetary-mass companions and
combine these measurements with published rotation rates for two additional
companions to provide a look at the spin distribution of these objects. We
compare this distribution to complementary rotation rate measurements for six
brown dwarfs with masses <20 M_Jup, and show that these distributions are
indistinguishable. This suggests that either that these two populations formed
via the same mechanism, or that processes regulating rotation rates are
independent of formation mechanism. We find that rotation rates for both
populations are well below their break-up velocities and do not evolve
significantly during the first few hundred million years after the end of
accretion. This suggests that rotation rates are set during late stages of
accretion, possibly by interactions with a circumplanetary disk. This result
has important implications for our understanding of the processes regulating

deformation. The physical shape of the fractures, they are long and thin
objects, puts strong limitations on how the effect of this dynamics can be
incorporated into standard reservoir simulation tools. This paper reports the
development of an open-source software framework, termed PorePy, which is aimed
at simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs,
as well as deformation of the reservoir due to shearing along fracture and
fault planes. Starting from a description of fractures as polygons embedded in
a 3D domain, PorePy provides semi-automatic gridding to construct a
discrete-fracture-matrix model, which forms the basis for subsequent
simulations. PorePy allows for flow and transport in all lower-dimensional
objects, including planes (2D) representing fractures, and lines (1D) and
points (0D), representing fracture intersections. Interaction between processes
in neighboring domains of different dimension is implemented as a sequence of
couplings of objects one dimension apart. This readily allows for handling of
complex fracture geometries compared to capabilities of existing software. In
addition to flow and transport, PorePy provides models for rock mechanics,
poro-elasticity and coupling with fracture deformation models. The software is
fully open, and can serve as a framework for transparency and reproducibility
of simulations. We describe the design principles of PorePy from a user
perspective, with focus on possibilities within gridding, covered physical
processes and available discretizations. The power of the framework is
illustrated with two sets of simulations; involving respectively coupled flow
and transport in a fractured porous medium, and low-pressure stimulation of a
geothermal reservoir.

to cognitive reserve (CR) during a memory task in healthy aging. We obtained
the magnetoencephalographic functional networks of 20 elders with a high or low
CR level to analyse the differences at network features. We reported a negative
correlation between synchronization of the whole network and CR, and observed
differences both at the node and at the network level in: the average shortest
path and the network outreach. Individuals with high CR required functional
networks with lower links to successfully carry out the memory task. These
results may indicate that those individuals with low CR level exhibited a dual
pattern of compensation and network impairment, since their functioning was
more energetically costly to perform the task as the high CR group.
Additionally, we evaluated how the dynamical properties of the different brain
regions were correlated to the network parameters obtaining that entropy was
positively correlated with the strength and clustering coefficient, while
complexity behaved conversely. Consequently, highly connected nodes of the
functional networks showed a more stochastic and less complex signal. We
consider that network approach may be a relevant tool to better understand
brain functioning in aging.

intensities ranging between $\sim 0.4$ $\mu$G and $\sim 8$ $\mu$G. Our main
results are: i) the CNM mass fraction diminishes with the increase in magnetic
field intensity. ii) There is a preferred alignment between CNM structures and
$\vec{B}$ in all our $B_0$ range but the preference weakens as $B_{0}$
increases. It is worth noticing that this preference is also present in
two-dimensional projections making an extreme angle ($0$ or $\pi / 2$) with
respect to $\vec{B_0}$ and it is only lost for the strongest magnetic field
when the angle of projection is perpendicular to $\vec{B_0}$. iii) The
aforementioned results are prevalent despite the inclusion of self-gravity in

occur at finite macroion's volume fraction, far away from the central macroion,
are much more intense, and increase, not decrease, as a function of the

atmospheric structure and heating of the solar chromosphere in an emerging flux
region. Methods. We use observations taken with the CHROMIS and CRISP
instruments on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in the Ca II K, Ca II 854.2 nm,
H$\alpha$, and Fe I 630.1 nm and 630.2 nm lines. We analyse the various line
profiles and in addition perform multi-line, multi-species, non-Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions to estimate the spatial and
temporal variation of the chromospheric structure. Results. We investigate
which spectral features of Ca II K contribute to the frequency-integrated Ca II
K brightness, which we use as a tracer of chromospheric radiative losses. The
majority of the radiative losses are not associated with localized high-Ca II
K-brightness events, but instead with a more gentle, spatially extended, and
persistent heating. The frequency-integrated Ca II K brightness correlates
strongly with the total linear polarization in the Ca II 854.2 nm line, while
the Ca II K profile shapes indicate that the bulk of the radiative losses occur
in the lower chromosphere.
  Non-LTE inversions indicate a transition from heating concentrated around
photospheric magnetic elements below $\log{\tau_{500}} =-3$ to a more
space-filling and time-persistent heating above $\log{\tau_{500}} =-4$. The
inferred gas temperature at $\log{\tau_{500}} =-3.8$ correlates strongly with
the total linear polarization in the Ca II 854.2 nm line, suggesting that that
the heating rate correlates with the strength of the horizontal magnetic field
in the low chromosphere.

one of the important topics in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. The primary
ingredient in these analyses is the population-averaged sensitive volume.
Typically, sensitive volume, of a given search to a given simulated source
population, is estimated by drawing signals from the population model and
adding them to the detector data as injections. Subsequently injections, which
are simulated gravitational waveforms, are searched for by the search pipelines
and their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is determined. Sensitive volume is
estimated, by using Monte-Carlo (MC) integration, from the total number of
injections added to the data, the number of injections that cross a chosen
threshold on SNR and the astrophysical volume in which the injections are
placed. So far, only fixed population models have been used in the estimation
of the merger rates. However, as the scope of population analysis broaden in
terms of the methodologies and source properties considered, due to an increase
in the number of observed GW signals, the procedure will need to be repeated
multiple times at a large computational cost. In this letter we address the
problem by performing a weighted MC integration. We show how a single set of
generic injections can be weighted to estimate the sensitive volume for
multiple population models; thereby greatly reducing the computational cost.
The weights in this MC integral are the ratios of the output probabilities,
determined by the population model and standard cosmology, and the injection
probability, determined by the distribution function of the generic injections.
Unlike analytical/semi-analytical methods, which usually estimate sensitive
volume using single detector sensitivity, the method is accurate within

removing this layer is essential for lifetime improvements. As a first step to

attractive tools for a number of applications including next generation

to an accumulation of high-order modes inside the cavity cells, resulting in
the development of a beam breakup (BBU) instability, unless the beam current is
kept below the BBU start current. This limits the maximum current which can be
transported through the ERL and hence the intensity of the photon beam
generated. It has recently been proposed that splitting the accelerating and
decelerating stages, tuning them separately and coupling them via a resonance
coupler can increase the BBU start current. The paper presents the first

take, it may be possible to adapt the error-correction procedure to compensate
for this noise, but performing full state tomography on a physical system to
analyse this structure quickly becomes impossible as the size increases beyond
a few qubits. Here we develop and test new methods to analyse blue a particular
class of spatially correlated errors by making use of parametrised families of
decoding algorithms. We demonstrate our method numerically using a diffusive
noise model. We show that information can be learnt about the parameters of the
noise model, and additionally that the logical error rates can be improved. We
conclude by discussing how our method could be utilised in a practical setting
blue and propose extensions of our work to study more general error models.

iPTF14hls taken on day 1153 after discovery. This spectrum reveals the clear
signature of shock interaction with dense circumstellar material (CSM). We
suggest that this CSM interaction may be an important clue for understanding
the extremely unusual photometric and spectroscopic evolution seen over the
first 600 days of iPTF14hls. The late-time spectrum shows a double-peaked
intermediate-width H-alpha line indicative of expansion speeds around 1000
km/s, with the double-peaked shape hinting at a disc-like geometry in the CSM.
If the CSM was highly asymmetric, perhaps in a disc or torus that was ejected
from the star 3-6 years prior to explosion, then the CSM interaction could have
been overrun and hidden below the SN ejecta photosphere from a wide range of
viewing angles. In that case, CSM interaction luminosity would have been
thermalized well below the photosphere, possibly sustaining the high luminosity
without exhibiting the traditional observational signatures of strong CSM
interaction (narrow H-alpha emission and X-rays). Variations in density
structure of the CSM could account for the multiple rebrightenings of the
lightcurve. We propose that enveloped CSM interaction as seen in some recent
SNe, rather than an entirely new explosion mechanism, may be adequate to
explain the peculiar evolution of iPTF14hls.

irregularities on the surface of the Al film have a significant contribution to
lowering the tunnel barrier height, while interplanar relaxations in the Al
film, away from the immediate interface do not have a notable impact on the
tunnelling properties. On the other hand, up to 5-7 layers of Al2O3 may be
involved in shaping the tunnel barriers. Interplanar relaxations of these

observed in noise, where a decision maker chooses at most L stopping times to
maximize a cumulative objective. We formulate the problem as a Partially
Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and derive structural results for the
optimal multiple stopping policy. The main results are as follows: i) The
optimal multiple stopping policy is shown to be characterized by threshold
curves in the unit simplex of Bayesian Posteriors. ii) The stopping setsl
(defined by the threshold curves) are shown to exhibit a nested structure. iii)
The optimal cumulative reward is shown to be monotone with respect to the
copositive ordering of the transition matrix. iv) A stochastic gradient
algorithm is provided for estimating linear threshold policies by exploiting
the structural results. These linear threshold policies approximate the
threshold curves, and share the monotone structure of the optimal multiple
stopping policy. As an illustrative example, we apply the multiple stopping
framework to interactively schedule advertisements in live online social media.
It is shown that advertisement scheduling using multiple stopping performs
significantly better than currently used methods.

is widely used in areas such as vision, natural language processing, and
recommendation. A softmax model has linear costs in the number of classes which
makes it too expensive for many real-world problems. A common approach to speed
up training involves sampling only some of the classes at each training step.
It is known that this method is biased and that the bias increases the more the
sampling distribution deviates from the output distribution. Nevertheless,
almost any recent work uses simple sampling distributions that require a large
sample size to mitigate the bias. In this work, we propose a new class of
kernel based sampling methods and develop an efficient sampling algorithm.
Kernel based sampling adapts to the model as it is trained, thus resulting in
low bias. Kernel based sampling can be easily applied to many models because it
relies only on the model's last hidden layer. We empirically study the
trade-off of bias, sampling distribution and sample size and show that kernel

serial models and the standard two process parallel models by investigating the
behavior of (conditional) distributions of the total completion times and
survivals of intercompletion times without assuming any particular forms for
the distributions of processing times. We address our argument through
mathematical proofs and computational methods. It is found that for the
standard two-process serial models, positive dependence between the total
completion times does not hold if no specific distributional forms are imposed
to the processing times. By contrast, for the standard two-process parallel
models the total completion times are independent. According to different
nature of process dependence, one can distinguish a standard two process serial
model from a standard two-process parallel model. We also find that in standard
two-process parallel models the monotonicity of survival function of the
intercompletion time of stage 2 conditional on the completion of stage 1
depends on the monotonicity of the hazard function of processing time. We also
find that the survival of intercompletion time(s) from stage 1 to stage 2 is
increasing when the ratio of hazard function meets certain criterion. Then the
empirical finding that the intercompletion time is grown with the growth of the
number of recalled words can be accounted by standard parallel models. We also
find that if the cumulative hazard function is concave or linear, the survival

to the high dimensionality of the system. Thus, a common approach is to first
plan in the low-dimensional space induced by the robot's feet---a task referred
to as footstep planning. This low-dimensional plan is then used to guide the
full motion of the robot. One approach that has proven successful in footstep
planning is using search-based planners such as A* and its many variants. To do
so, these search-based planners have to be endowed with effective heuristics to
efficiently guide them through the search space. However, designing effective
heuristics is a time-consuming task that requires the user to have good domain
knowledge. Thus, our goal is to be able to effectively plan the footstep
motions taken by a humanoid robot while obviating the burden on the user to
carefully design local-minima free heuristics. To this end, we propose to use
user-defined homotopy classes in the workspace that are intuitive to define.
These homotopy classes are used to automatically generate heuristic functions
that efficiently guide the footstep planner. Additionally, we present an
extension to homotopy classes such that they are applicable to complex
multi-level environments. We compare our approach for footstep planning with a
standard approach that uses a heuristic common to footstep planning. In simple
scenarios, the performance of both algorithms is comparable. However, in more
complex scenarios our approach allows for a speedup in planning of several
orders of magnitude when compared to the standard approach.

the issue of molecular potential among micromolecules of charged AdS black
holes, and point out explicitly that the well-known experiential Lennard-Jones

the interaction force induced by the Lennard-Jones potential coincides with
that of the thermodynamic scalar curvature. Both the Lennard-Jones potential

often poorly designed (from a user perspective) is that programmers are in

programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target
audience, a phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'. This
paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate. While the re-emergence
of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers
are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended
users. But explainable AI is more likely to succeed if researchers and
practitioners understand, adopt, implement, and improve models from the vast
and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive
science, and if evaluation of these models is focused more on people than on
technology. From a light scan of literature, we demonstrate that there is
considerable scope to infuse more results from the social and behavioural

destructive interference of coherent lattice waves propagating through and
around the nanoparticle, gives rise to sharp and significant transmittance
dips, blocking the lower-end frequency range of phonon transport that is hardly
diminished by other nanostructures. The resonance is sensitive to the phonon
coherent length, where the finiteness of the wave packet width weakens the
transmittance dip even when coherent length is longer than the particle

describe the neutron capture and decays of 2696 nuclei, numerically without
truncating those to include only either capture or decay as traditionally
assumed in weak neutron flux (s process). As a result the synthesis of heavy
nuclei always evolves along a wide band in the valley of stable nuclei. The
observed abundances in the Solar system are reproduced reasonably already in
the simplest version of the model. The model predicts that the nucleosynthesis
in weak or modest neutron flux produces elements that are traditionally assumed

can optimize retrieval speed and storage cost while preserving semantic
information. Because hashing codes learning is NP-hard, many methods resort to
some form of relaxation technique. But the performance of these methods can
easily deteriorate due to the relaxation. Luckily, many supervised hashing
formulations can be viewed as energy functions, hence solving hashing codes is
equivalent to learning marginals in the corresponding conditional random field
(CRF). By minimizing the KL divergence between a fully factorized distribution
and the Gibbs distribution of this CRF, a set of consistency equations can be
obtained, but updating them in parallel may not yield a local optimum since the
variational lower bound is not guaranteed to increase. In this paper, we use a
linear approximation of the sigmoid function to convert these consistency
equations to linear systems, which have a closed-form solution. By applying
this novel technique to two classical hashing formulations KSH and SPLH, we
obtain two new methods called EM (energy minimizing based)-KSH and EM-SPLH.

effect between adopting pure Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.
Our aim is to reduce the fitting error by studying new input physics. The
starting models including their chemical composition profile are from white
dwarf models evolved by \texttt{MESA}. They were calculated following the
stellar evolution from the main sequence to the start of the white dwarf
cooling sequences. The optimal parameters are basically consistent with that of
previous spectroscopic and asteroseismological studies. The pure and screened
Coulomb potential lead to different composition profiles of the C/O-He
interface area. High $k$ modes are very sensitive to the area. However, most of
the observed modes for PG 0112+104 are low $k$ modes. The $\sigma_{RMS}$ taking
the screened Coulomb potential is reduced by 4\% compared with taking the pure

play a critical role in determining the structure of the reconnection region,

  Guarantees","10 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a time-evolving graph, how can we track similarity between nodes in a
fast and accurate way, with theoretical guarantees on the convergence and the
error? Random Walk with Restart (RWR) is a popular measure to estimate the
similarity between nodes and has been exploited in numerous applications. Many
real-world graphs are dynamic with frequent insertion/deletion of edges; thus,
tracking RWR scores on dynamic graphs in an efficient way has aroused much
interest among data mining researchers. Recently, dynamic RWR models based on
the propagation of scores across a given graph have been proposed, and have
succeeded in outperforming previous other approaches to compute RWR
dynamically. However, those models fail to guarantee exactness and convergence
time for updating RWR in a generalized form. In this paper, we propose OSP, a
fast and accurate algorithm for computing dynamic RWR with insertion/deletion
of nodes/edges in a directed/undirected graph. When the graph is updated, OSP
first calculates offset scores around the modified edges, propagates the offset
scores across the updated graph, and then merges them with the current RWR
scores to get updated RWR scores. We prove the exactness of OSP and introduce
OSP-T, a version of OSP which regulates a trade-off between accuracy and
computation time by using error tolerance {\epsilon}. Given restart probability
c, OSP-T guarantees to return RWR scores with O ({\epsilon} /c ) error in O
(log ({\epsilon}/2)/log(1-c)) iterations. Through extensive experiments, we
show that OSP tracks RWR exactly up to 4605x faster than existing static RWR
method on dynamic graphs, and OSP-T requires up to 15x less time with 730x
lower L1 norm error and 3.3x lower rank error than other state-of-the-art
dynamic RWR methods.

Company assessment criteria, for their credit ratings, from 2010 to 2015.
Practically, 3 debt ratios are examined in terms of 11 characteristic
variables. Moreover, any relationship between credit rating and corporate
governance can be thought to be an interesting finding. The relationship
between credit rating and leverage is not as evident as that found by other
researchers from different countries; it is significantly positively related to
the outside director, firm size, tangible assets and firm age, and CEO and
chairman office plurality. However, leverage is found to be negatively
correlated with board size, profitability, growth opportunity, and non-debt tax
shield. Credit rating is positively associated with leverage, but in a less
significant way. CEO-Board chairship duality is insignificantly related to
leverage. The non-debt tax shield is significantly correlated with leverage.
The correlation coefficient between CEO duality and auditor is positive but
weakly significant, but seems not consistent with expectations. Finally,
profitability cause could be regarded as an interesting finding. Indeed, there
is an inverse correlation between profitability and total debt (Notice that the
result supports the pecking order theory). In conclusion, it appears that
credit rating has less effect on the so listed large Chinese companies than in
other countries. Nevertheless, the perspective of assessing credit risk rating
by relevant agencies is indubitably a recommended time dependent leverage
determinant.

regions indicates that the formation of filamentary structures is a natural
product of the physics at play in the magnatized turbulent cold ISM.
  An analysis of more than 270 filaments observed with {\it Herschel} in 8
regions of the Gould Belt, shows that interstellar filaments are characterized
by a narrow distribution of central width, while they span a wide column
density range.
  Molecular line observations of a sample of these filaments show evidence of
an increase in the velocity dispersion of dense filaments with column density,
suggesting an evolution in mass per unit length due to accretion of surrounding
material onto these star-forming filaments.
  The analyses of \planck\ dust polarization observations show that the mean
magnetic field along the filaments is different from that of their surrounding
clouds. This points to a coupling between the matter and the $\vec{B}$-field in
the filament formation process. These observational results, derived from dust
and gas tracers in total and polarized intensity, set strong constraints on
theoretical models for filament formation and evolution. They also provide
important hints on the initial conditions of the star formation process from
the fragmentation of dense (supercritical) filaments. Higher resolution dust
polarization observations and large scale molecular line mapping are
nevertheless required to investigate in more details the internal structure of

original factorization theorems which characterize two specific primary cases
of the expansions of Lambert series generating functions: factorizations for
Hadamard products of Lambert series and for higher-order derivatives of Lambert
series. The series coefficients corresponding to these two generating function
cases are important enough to require the special due attention we give to
their expansions within the article, and moreover, are significant in that they
connect the characteristic expansions of Lambert series over special
multiplicative functions to the explicitly additive nature of the theory of
partitions. Applications of our new results provide new exotic sums involving
multiplicative functions, new summation-based interpretations of the
coefficients of the integer-order $j^{th}$ derivatives of Lambert series
generating functions, several new series for the Riemann zeta function, and an
exact identity for the number of distinct primes dividing $n$.

suffer from the grounding problem. Recent work has shown promising results in
improving the qualities of sentence representations by jointly training them

due to distant connection between input sentences and image features by the
design of the architecture. In order to further close the gap, we propose
applying self-attention mechanism to the sentence encoder to deepen the

are not dependent on wave functions, so to find the energy values; it is enough
to find the classic turning points of the potential function. Two different
solutions were obtained, namely, symmetric and antisymmetric at bound states.
These normalized wave functions are always periodic. It is enough to take the
integral of the square root of the potential energy function to find the
normalized wave functions. If these calculations cannot be made analytically,
it should then be performed by numerical methods. SE has been solved for a
particle in many one-dimension and the spherical symmetric central potential
well as examples. It has been found their energies and normalized wave
functions as examples. These solutions were also applied to the theories of
scattering and alpha decay. The results obtained with the experimental values

and Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) formalism we derive analytical expressions
for the fractal dimension D_{1} that distinguishes between the extended
ergodic, D_{1}=1, and extended non-ergodic (multifractal), 0<D_{1}<1 states on
the Bethe lattice and random regular graphs with the branching number K. We
also employ RSB formalism to derive the analytical expression
ln(1/S_{typ})~(W_{c}-W)^{-1} for the typical imaginary part of self-energy
S_{typ} in the non-ergodic phase close to the Anderson transition in the
conventional thermodynamic limit. We prove the existence of an extended
non-ergodic phase in a broad range of disorder strength and energy and
establish the phase diagrams of the models as a function of disorder and
energy. The results of the analytical theory are compared with large-scale
population dynamics and with the exact diagonalization of Anderson model on

sources robustly detected in the region (a detection with high signal-to-noise
and low axis ratio at multiple wavelengths), including protostars and starless
cores, 29 are found in a filamentary hub at the centre of the region (a little
over 1% of the observed area). These objects are on average smaller, more
massive, and more luminous than those in the surrounding regions (which
together suggest that they are at a later stage of evolution), a result that
cannot be explained entirely by selection effects. These results suggest a
picture in which the hub may have begun star formation at a point significantly
earlier than the outer regions, possibly forming as a result of feedback from
earlier star formation. Furthermore, the hub may be sustaining its star
formation by accreting material from the surrounding filaments.

the inverse power corrections $1/Q^{2 n}$, a nonperturbative generalization
$A(Q^2)$ of the perturbative QCD running coupling $a(Q^2)$ ($\equiv
\alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$). Recent large volume lattice calculations for these
dressing functions strongly indicate that such a generalized coupling goes to
zero as $A(Q^2) \sim Q^2$ when the squared momenta $Q^2$ go to zero ($Q^2 \ll 1
\ {\rm GeV}^2$). We construct such a QCD coupling $A(Q^2)$ which fulfills also
various other physically motivated conditions. At high momenta it becomes the
underlying perturbative coupling $a(Q^2)$ to a very high precision. And at
intermediately low momenta $Q^2 \sim 1 \ {\rm GeV}^2$ it gives results
consistent with the data of the semihadronic $\tau$ lepton decays as measured
by OPAL and ALEPH. The coupling is constructed in a dispersive way, ensuring as
a byproduct the holomorphic behavior of $A(Q^2)$ in the complex $Q^2$-plane
which reflects the holomorphic behavior of the spacelike QCD observables.
Application of the Borel sum rules to $\tau$-decay V + A spectral functions
allows us to obtain values for the gluon (dimension-4) condensate and the
dimension-6 condensate, which reproduce the measured OPAL and ALEPH data to a
significantly better precision than the perturbative MSbar coupling (+OPE)
approach. The comparison with the experimental V-channel Adler function,
related with the $e^+ e^- \to$ hadrons ratio, at low $Q^2 \sim 1 \ {\rm

Given a video, the task is to segment all the objects that exhibit independent
motion in at least one frame. We formulate this as a learning problem and
design our framework with three cues: (i) independent object motion between a
pair of frames, which complements object recognition, (ii) object appearance,
which helps to correct errors in motion estimation, and (iii) temporal
consistency, which imposes additional constraints on the segmentation. The
framework is a two-stream neural network with an explicit memory module. The
two streams encode appearance and motion cues in a video sequence respectively,
while the memory module captures the evolution of objects over time, exploiting
the temporal consistency. The motion stream is a convolutional neural network
trained on synthetic videos to segment independently moving objects in the
optical flow field. The module to build a 'visual memory' in video, i.e., a
joint representation of all the video frames, is realized with a convolutional
recurrent unit learned from a small number of training video sequences.
  For every pixel in a frame of a test video, our approach assigns an object or
background label based on the learned spatio-temporal features as well as the
'visual memory' specific to the video. We evaluate our method extensively on
three benchmarks, DAVIS, Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation dataset and
SegTrack. In addition, we provide an extensive ablation study to investigate
both the choice of the training data and the influence of each component in the
proposed framework.

the acceleration constant, $a_0$, is a little larger than the observational

different from what Milgrom proposed ($a_0\propto H$). Therefore, while galaxy
rotation curves can be fitted by MOND's empirical function in the $\Lambda$CDM
model, there is no clear connection between $a_0$ and the Hubble constant. We
also find that $a_0$ at $z\gtrapprox 1$ is well separated from $a_0$ at $z=0$.

rule out the modified gravity model based on MOND-like empirical function with

challenge raised by mobile vision: the cache must operate under video scene
variation, while trading off among cacheability, overhead, and loss in model
accuracy. At the input of a model, DeepCache discovers video temporal locality
by exploiting the video's internal structure, for which it borrows proven
heuristics from video compression; into the model, DeepCache propagates regions
of reusable results by exploiting the model's internal structure. Notably,
DeepCache eschews applying video heuristics to model internals which are not
pixels but high-dimensional, difficult-to-interpret data. Our implementation of
DeepCache works with unmodified deep learning models, requires zero developer's
manual effort, and is therefore immediately deployable on off-the-shelf mobile

dimensional phenomenon this von Neumann algebra is approximated by algebraic
(i.e., formal) curvature tensors of the underlying $4$-manifold and the von
Neumann algebra itself is a hyperfinite factor of ${\rm II}_1$ type hence is
unique up to abstract isomorphisms of von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless over a
fixed $4$-manifold this von Neumann algebra admits a representation on a
Hilbert space such that its unitary equivalence class is preserved by
orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Consequently the Murray--von Neumann
coupling constant of this representation is well-defined and gives rise to a
new and computable real-valued smooth $4$-manifold invariant.
  Some consequences of this construction for quantum gravity are also
discussed. Namely reversing the construction by starting not with a particular

conceptually simple but manifestly four dimensional, covariant,

an active liquid argon target of nearly one tonne in mass. The analysis of the
data and comparison to simulations allowed for a test of the crucial detector
properties and confirmed the low background performance of the setup. The
statistical rejection power for electron recoil events using the pulse shape
discrimination method was estimated using data from a Cf-252 neutron
calibration source. Electron and nuclear recoil band profiles were found to be
well described by Gaussian distributions. Employing such a model we derive
values for the electron recoil statistical rejection power of more than 10$^8$
in the tonne-scale liquid argon target for events with more than 50 detected
photons at a 50% acceptance for nuclear recoils. The Rn-222 emanation rate of
the ArDM cryostat at room temperature was found to be 65.6$\pm$0.4 $\mu$Hz/l,
and the Ar-39 specific activity from the employed atmospheric argon to be
0.95$\pm$0.05 Bq/kg. The cosmic muon flux at the Canfranc underground site was
determined to be between 2 and 3.5$\times 10^{-3}m^{2}s^{-1}$ . These results
pave the way for the next physics run of ArDM in the double-phase operational
mode.

  Categorical Data","9 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Missingness in categorical data is a common problem in various real
applications. Traditional approaches either utilize only the complete
observations or impute the missing data by some ad hoc methods rather than the
true conditional distribution of the missing data, thus losing or distorting
the rich information in the partial observations. In this paper, we propose the
Dirichlet Process Mixture of Collapsed Product-Multinomials (DPMCPM) to model
the full data jointly and compute the model efficiently. By fitting an infinite
mixture of product-multinomial distributions, DPMCPM is applicable for any
categorical data regardless of the true distribution, which may contain complex
association among variables. Under the framework of latent class analysis, we
show that DPMCPM can model general missing mechanisms by creating an extra
category to denote missingness, which implicitly integrates out the missing
part with regard to their true conditional distribution. Through simulation
studies and a real application, we demonstrate that DPMCPM outperforms existing
approaches on statistical inference and imputation for incomplete categorical
data of various missing mechanisms. DPMCPM is implemented as the R package
\texttt{MMDai}, which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MMDai/index.html.

for the free fall of particles (where anyway length action is not defined for
massless particles), nor out of economy, but from the weak equivalence
principle (gravitational force is equivalent to acceleration according to
Einstein) together with the identification of the local inertial frame with the
local Lorentz one. This identification implies that the orbits of all particles
are given by the geodesics of the Christoffel connection. Here, we show that in
the presence of only massless particles (absence of massive particles) the
above identification is inconsistent and does not lead to any connection. The
proof is based on the existence of projectively equivalent connections and the
absence of proper time for null particles. If a connection derived by some
kinematical principles for the particles is to be applied in the world, it is
better these principles to be valid in all relevant spacetime rather than
different principles to give different connections in different spacetime
regions. Therefore, our result stated above may imply a conceptual
insufficiency of the use of the Christoffel connection in the early universe
where only massless particles are expected to be present (whenever at least
some notions, like orbits, are meaningful), and thus of the total use of this
connection. If in the early universe the notion of a massive particle, which
appears latter in time, cannot be used, in an analogous way in a causally
disconnected high-energy region (maybe deep interior of astrophysical objects
or black holes) the same conclusions could be extracted if only massless
particles are present.

range of unique sensor data creating countless opportunities for deep learning
tasks. We propose DeepWear, a deep learning (DL) framework for wearable devices
to improve the performance and reduce the energy footprint. DeepWear
strategically offloads DL tasks from a wearable device to its paired handheld
device through local network. Compared to the remote-cloud-based offloading,
DeepWear requires no Internet connectivity, consumes less energy, and is robust
to privacy breach. DeepWear provides various novel techniques such as
context-aware offloading, strategic model partition, and pipelining support to
efficiently utilize the processing capacity from nearby paired handhelds.
Deployed as a user-space library, DeepWear offers developer-friendly APIs that
are as simple as those in traditional DL libraries such as TensorFlow. We have
implemented DeepWear on the Android OS and evaluated it on COTS smartphones and
smartwatches with real DL models. DeepWear brings up to 5.08X and 23.0X
execution speedup, as well as 53.5% and 85.5% energy saving compared to
wearable-only and handheld-only strategies, respectively.

significant for the development of network science. However, present researches
on evolutionary mechanism of online social networks are neither deep nor clear
enough. In this study, we empirically showed the essential evolution
characteristics of Renren online social network. From the perspective of Pareto
wealth distribution and bidirectional preferential attachment, the origin of
online social network evolution is analyzed and the evolution mechanism of
online social networks is explained. Then a novel model is proposed to
reproduce the essential evolution characteristics which are consistent with the
ones of Renren online social network, and the evolutionary analytical solution
to the model is presented. The model can also well predict the ordinary
power-law degree distribution. In addition, the universal bowing phenomenon of
the degree distribution in many online social networks is explained and
predicted by the model. The results suggest that Pareto wealth distribution and
bidirectional preferential attachment can play an important role in the
evolution process of online social networks and can help us to understand the
evolutionary origin of online social networks. The model has significant
implications for dynamic simulation researches of social networks, especially
in information diffusion through online communities and infection spreading in
real societies.

multiple waves, only one of which is gaussian. The radiation direction of the
gaussian wave is distinguishable according to the order of incident OAM.
Consequently, by locating the gaussian wave, the incident OAM can be
conveniently determined. We use a simple field source to simulate the incident
OAM wave in fullwave simulation. It largely simplifies the simulation process
when an incident wave carrying OAM is needed. Both numerical and full-wave
simulation results are provided to validate our design and they show a good
agreement with each other. Then, the metasurface is optimized for high

under intense debate for the last decades. With many applications in several
areas, the Tsallis statistics has been discussed in details in many works and
triggered an interesting discussion on the most deep meaning of entropy and its
role in complex systems. Some possible mechanisms that could give rise to non

particular a fractal structure in thermodynamics functions was recently
proposed as a possible origin for non extensive statistics in physical systems.
In the present work we investigate the properties of such fractal
thermodynamical system and propose a diagrammatic method for calculations of
relevant quantities related to such system. It is shown that a system with the
fractal structure described here presents temperature fluctuation following an
Euler Gamma Function, in accordance with previous works that evidenced the
connections between those fluctuations and Tsallis statistics. Finally, the
fractal scale invariance is discussed in terms of the Callan-Symanzik Equation.

theories used in the field of kinetics sorption of pollutants in porous
materials: the Brouers-Sotolongo model family of kinetics based on the BurrXII
statistical distribution and the fractional kinetics based on the
Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative theory. Using the experimental kinetics
data of several studies published recently, it can be concluded that, although
these two models both yield very similar results, the Brouers-Sotolongo model
is easier to use due to its simpler formal expression and because it enjoys all
the properties of a well-known family of distribution functions. We use the
opportunity of this study to comment on the information, in particular, the
sorption strength, the half-life time, and the time dependent rate, which can
be drawn from a complete analysis of measured kinetics using a fractal model.
This is of importance to characterize and classify sorbent-sorbate couples for
practical applications. Finally, a generalization form of the Brouers-Sotolongo
equation is presented by introducing a time dependent fractal exponent. This
improvement, which has a physical meaning, is necessary in some cases to obtain
a good fit of the experimental data.
