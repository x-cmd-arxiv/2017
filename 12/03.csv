algorithm that performs dimensionality reduction on high dimensional input
signal. It extracts those subsignals that are most predictable according to a
certain prediction model. We refer to these extracted signals as predictable
features.
  In this work we extend the notion of PFA to take supplementary information
into account for improving its predictions. Such information can be a
multidimensional signal like the main input to PFA, but is regarded external.
That means it won't participate in the feature extraction - no features get
extracted or composed of it. Features will be exclusively extracted from the
main input such that they are most predictable based on themselves and the
supplementary information. We refer to this enhanced PFA as PFAx (PFA
extended).
  Even more important than improving prediction quality is to observe the
effect of supplementary information on feature selection. PFAx transparently
provides insight how the supplementary information adds to prediction quality
and whether it is valuable at all. Finally we show how to invert that relation
and can generate the supplementary information such that it would yield a
certain desired outcome of the main signal.
  We apply this to a setting inspired by reinforcement learning and let the
algorithm learn how to control an agent in an environment. With this method it
is feasible to locally optimize the agent's state, i.e. reach a certain goal
that is near enough. We are preparing a follow-up paper that extends this
method such that also global optimization is feasible.

packet anonymity that allows the inter-connections in a network to be
decoupled. This enables each intermediate node to consider complex network
inter-connections as a node-environment interaction such that the Markov
decision process (MDP) can be employed at each intermediate node. The optimal
policy that can be obtained by solving the MDP provides each node with optimal
amount of changes in transmission range given network dynamics (e.g., the
number of nodes in the range and channel condition). Hence, the network can be
adaptively and optimally evolved by responding to the network dynamics. The
proposed strategy is used to maximize long-term utility, which is achieved by
considering both current network conditions and future network dynamics. We
define the utility of an action to include network throughput gain and the cost
of transmission power. We show that the resulting network of the proposed
strategy eventually converges to stationary networks, which maintain the states

data-driven model design. An important reason that prevents fuzzy (rule-based)
systems from being leveraged in large-scale applications is the flat structure
of rule bases, along with the local nature of fuzzy rules and their limited
ability to express complex dependencies between variables. This motivates
alternative approaches to fuzzy systems modeling, in which functional

capacity at each server and reduced delivery rate per server; however, this
also leads to reduced multicasting opportunities compared to a single server
serving all the users simultaneously. A joint storage and proactive caching
scheme is proposed, which exploits coded storage across the servers, uncoded
cache placement at the users, and coded delivery. The delivery \textit{latency}
is studied for both \textit{successive} and \textit{simultaneous} transmission
from the servers. It is shown that, with successive transmission the achievable
average delivery latency is comparable to that achieved by a single server,
while the gap between the two depends on $\rho$, the available redundancy
across servers, and can be reduced by increasing the storage capacity at the
SBSs.

network coded flows as finding maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) in the
conflict graph of the network. Finding MWIS of a general graph is NP-hard
leading to an NP-hard complexity of scheduling. In a claw-free conflict graph,
MWIS can be found in polynomial time leading to a throughput-optimal
scheduling. We show that the conflict graph of certain wireless ad hoc networks
are claw-free. In order to obtain claw-free conflict graphs in general
networks, we suggest introducing additional conflicts (edges) while keeping the
decrease in MWIS size minimal. To this end, we introduce an iterative
optimization problem to decide where to introduce edges and investigate its
efficient implementation. Besides, we exemplify some physical modifications to
manipulate the conflict graph of a network and also propose a mixed scheduling
strategy for specific networks. We conclude that claw breaking method by adding

  project page: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/M%26M/",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep convolutional networks for semantic image segmentation typically require
large-scale labeled data, e.g. ImageNet and MS COCO, for network pre-training.
To reduce annotation efforts, self-supervised semantic segmentation is recently
proposed to pre-train a network without any human-provided labels. The key of
this new form of learning is to design a proxy task (e.g. image colorization),
from which a discriminative loss can be formulated on unlabeled data. Many
proxy tasks, however, lack the critical supervision signals that could induce
discriminative representation for the target image segmentation task. Thus
self-supervision's performance is still far from that of supervised
pre-training. In this study, we overcome this limitation by incorporating a
""mix-and-match"" (M&M) tuning stage in the self-supervision pipeline. The
proposed approach is readily pluggable to many self-supervision methods and
does not use more annotated samples than the original process. Yet, it is
capable of boosting the performance of target image segmentation task to
surpass fully-supervised pre-trained counterpart. The improvement is made
possible by better harnessing the limited pixel-wise annotations in the target
dataset. Specifically, we first introduce the ""mix"" stage, which sparsely
samples and mixes patches from the target set to reflect rich and diverse local
patch statistics of target images. A ""match"" stage then forms a class-wise
connected graph, which can be used to derive a strong triplet-based
discriminative loss for fine-tuning the network. Our paradigm follows the
standard practice in existing self-supervised studies and no extra data or
label is required. With the proposed M&M approach, for the first time, a
self-supervision method can achieve comparable or even better performance
compared to its ImageNet pre-trained counterpart on both PASCAL VOC2012 dataset
and CityScapes dataset.

in a compressible liquid. The method is designed to capture the strong,
volumetric oscillations of each bubble and the bubble-scattered acoustics. The
dynamics of the bubbly mixture is formulated using volume-averaged equations of
motion. The continuous phase is discretized on an Eulerian grid and integrated
using a high-order, finite-volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)
scheme, while the gas phase is modeled as spherical, Lagrangian point-bubbles
at the sub-grid scale, each of whose radial evolution is tracked by solving the
Keller-Miksis equation. The volume of bubbles is mapped onto the Eulerian grid
as the void fraction by using a regularization (smearing) kernel. In the most
general case, where the bubble distribution is arbitrary, three-dimensional
Cartesian grids are used for spatial discretization. In order to reduce the
computational cost for problems possessing translational or rotational
homogeneities, we spatially average the governing equations along the direction
of symmetry and discretize the continuous phase on two-dimensional or
axi-symmetric grids, respectively. We specify a regularization kernel that maps
the three-dimensional distribution of bubbles onto the field of an averaged
two-dimensional or axi-symmetric void fraction. A closure is developed to model
the pressure fluctuations at the sub-grid scale as synthetic noise. For the
examples considered here, modeling the sub-grid pressure fluctuations as white
noise agrees a priori with computed distributions from three-dimensional
simulations, and suffices, a posteriori, to accurately reproduce the statistics
of the bubble dynamics. The numerical method and its verification are described

condensed matter systems. For instance, when incorporated into crystalline
membranes like graphene, disclinations with positive and negative topological
charge elastically buckle the material into conical and saddle-like shapes
respectively. A recently uncovered mapping between the inter-element spacing in
2D columnar structures and the metric properties of curved surfaces motivates
basic questions about the interplay between defects in the cross section of a
columnar bundle and its 3D shape. Such questions are critical to the structure
of a broad class of filamentous materials, from biological assemblies like
protein fibers to nano- or micro-structured synthetic materials like carbon
nanotube bundles. Here, we explore the buckling behavior for elementary
disclinations in hexagonal bundles using a combination of continuum elasticity
theory and numerical simulations of discrete-filaments. We show that shape
instabilities are controlled by a single material-dependent parameter that
characterizes the ratio of inter-filament to intra-filament elastic energies.
Along with a host of previously unknown shape equilibria---the filamentous
analogs to the conical and saddle-like shapes of defective membranes---we find
a profoundly asymmetric response to positive and negative topologically charged
defects in the infinite length limit that is without parallel to the membrane
analog. The highly non-linear dependence on the sign of the disclination charge
is shown to have a purely geometric origin, stemming the from the distinct
compatibility (or incompatibility) of effectively positive- (or negative-)
curvature geometries with lengthwise-constant filament spacing.

an infinite number of noisy models $f_\epsilon$ without any additional memory

Adversarial Network Games (GANGs), which explicitly model a finite zero-sum

The size of these games precludes exact solution methods, therefore we define
resource-bounded best responses (RBBRs), and a resource-bounded Nash

`local Nash equilibria' in that it captures not only failures of escaping local
optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response
computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach,
we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably
monotonically converges to an RB-NE. We compare our results to standard GAN
setups, and demonstrate that our method deals well with typical GAN problems

to directly image such propagating spin waves and their excitation over a wide

heterosymmetric mode profile, involving regions with anti-Larmor precession
sense and purely linear magnetic oscillation. In particular, this mode profile
consists of dynamic vortices with laterally alternating helicity, leading to a
partial magnetic flux closure over the film thickness, which is explained by a
strong and unexpected mode hybridisation. This spin-wave phenomenon observed is
a general effect inherent to the dynamics of sufficiently thick ferromagnetic
single layer films, independent of the specific excitation method employed.

testbeds of gravity in the strong and dynamical field regime. One possible
modification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that
gives rise to the amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, where one of
the circularly-polarized mode is amplified while the other one is suppressed
during their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure
gravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence of gravitational
waves from stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as
an example and work within an effective field theory formalism. We consider
gravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational
wave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate them
using a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly
distributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find
that the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from
GW150914 are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while
aLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds
from stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, we set the threshold
signal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and
estimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are
consistent with no parity violation. We find that a network of two
third-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are slightly stronger
than current binary pulsar bounds. Since gravitational wave observations probe
either the difference in parity violation between the source and the detector
or the line-of-sight integration of the scalar field, such bounds are
complementary to local measurements from solar system experiments and binary
pulsar observations.

demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of
stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the
fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans.
Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several
biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show
that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of
the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one
involving the atypical protein kinase PKM{\zeta} and its messenger RNA, the
other involving PKM{\zeta} and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate
that robust bistability - stable equilibria both in the synapse's potentiated

parameter $\xi$ common to Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized
Pareto (GP) distributions, which drives the tail behavior, and is of major
impact on the estimation of return levels and periods. Many practitioners make
the choice of a Bayesian framework to conduct this assessment for accounting of
parametric uncertainties, which are typically high in such analyses
characterized by a low number of observations. Nonetheless, such approaches can
provide large credibility domains for $\xi$, including negative and positive
values, which does not allow to conclude on the nature of the tail. Considering
the block maxima framework, a generic approach of the determination of the
value and sign of $\xi$ arises from model selection between the Fr\'echet,
Gumbel and Weibull possible domains of attraction conditionally to
observations. Opposite to the common choice of the GEV as an appropriate model
for {\it sampling} extreme values, this model selection must be conducted with
great care. The elicitation of proper, informative and easy-to use priors is
conducted based on the following principle: for all parameter dimensions they
act as posteriors of noninformative priors and virtual samples. Statistics of
these virtual samples can be assessed from prior predictive information, and a
compatibility rule can be carried out to complete the calibration, even though
they are only semi-conjugated. Besides, the model selection is conducted using

the strong local clustering of nodes. Unveiling the community structure of a
network is deemed to a crucial step towards understanding the dynamics on the
network. Actually, most of the real-world networks are dynamic and their
community structures are evolutionary over time accordingly. How to revealing
the dynamical communities has recently become a pressing issue. Here, we
present an evolutionary method for accurately identifying dynamical communities
in the networks. In this method, we first introduced a fitness function that is
a compound of asymptotic surprise values on the current and previous snapshots
of the network. Second, we developed ad hoc merging and splitting operators,
which allows for large-scale searching while preserving low cost. Third, this
large-scale searching coupled with local mutation and crossover enhanced
revealing a better solution to each snapshot of the network. This method does
not require specifying the number of communities advanced, and free from
resolution limit while satisfying temporal smooth constraint. Experimental
results on both model and real dynamic networks show that the method can find a
better solution compared with state-of-art approaches.

including design optimization, data assimilation, and mesh adaptation has
sparked the interest of both researchers and practitioners alike. In many of
these fields, the concept of an adjoint is explained differently, with various

existence of two seemingly different types of adjoints -- ""continuous"" and
""discrete"" -- as well as the more formal definition of adjoint operators
employed in linear algebra and functional analysis. These issues can make the
fundamental concept of an adjoint difficult to pin down. In these notes, we
hope to clarify some of the ideas surrounding adjoint vectors and to provide a
useful reference for both continuous and discrete adjoints alike. In
particular, we focus on the use of adjoints within the context of output-based
mesh adaptation, where the goal is to achieve accuracy in a particular quantity
(or ""output"") of interest by performing targeted adaptation of the
computational mesh. While this is our application of interest, the ideas
discussed here apply directly to design optimization, data assimilation, and

the number of subtrees $F(T)$ have been a long standing pair of graph
invariants that are well known for their negative correlation. That is, among
various given classes of trees, the extremal structures maximizing one usually
minimize the other, and vice versa. By introducing the ""local"" versions of
these invariants, $\sigma_T(v)$ for the sum of distance from $v$ to all other
vertices and $F_T(v)$ for the number of subtrees containing $v$, extremal
problems can be raised and studied for vertices within a tree. This leads to
the concept of ""middle parts"" of a tree with respect to different indices. A
challenging problem is to find extremal values of the ratios between graph
indices and corresponding local functions at middle parts or leaves. This
problem also provides new opportunities to further verify the the correlation
between different indices such as $\sigma(T)$ and $F(T)$. Such extremal ratios,
along with the extremal structures, were studied and compared for the distance
and subtree problems for general trees In this paper this study is extended to
binary trees, a class of trees with numerous practical applications in which
the extremal ratio problems appear to be even more complicated. After
justifying some basic properties on the distance and subtree problems in trees
and binary trees, characterizations are provided for the extremal structures
achieving two extremal ratios in binary trees of given order. The
generalization of this work to $k$-ary trees is also briefly discussed. The
findings are compared with the previous established extremal structures in
general trees. Lastly some potential future work is mentioned.

resulting in enhanced robustness to adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we
propose compact convolution, a novel method of convolution that when

convolution ensures feature compactness at every layer such that they are

wave (mmWave) systems, and design an optimal algorithm to reduce the overhead.
Specifically, due to directional communications, the transmitter and receiver
beams need to be aligned, which incurs high delay overhead since without a
priori knowledge of the transmitter/receiver location, the search space spans
the entire angular domain. This is further exacerbated under dynamic conditions
(e.g., moving vehicles) where the access to the base station (access point) is
highly dynamic with intermittent on-off periods, requiring more frequent beam
alignment and signal training. To mitigate this issue, we consider an online
stochastic optimization formulation where the goal is to maximize the
directivity gain (i.e., received energy) of the beam alignment policy within a
time period. We exploit the inherent correlation and unimodality properties of
the model, and demonstrate that contextual information improves the
performance. To this end, we propose an equivalent structured Multi-Armed
Bandit model to optimally exploit the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In
contrast to the classical MAB models, the contextual information makes the
lower bound on regret (i.e., performance loss compared with an oracle policy)
independent of the number of beams. This is a crucial property since the number
of all combinations of beam patterns can be large in transceiver antenna
arrays, especially in massive MIMO systems. We further provide an
asymptotically optimal beam alignment algorithm, and investigate its
performance via simulations.

assigns the storage load in a decentralized manner. The local information

recovering incomplete visual data whose partial elements are missing. By taking
a color image or video as a three-dimensional (3D) tensor, previous studies
have suggested several definitions of tensor nuclear norm. However, they have
limitations and may not properly approximate the real rank of a tensor.
Besides, they do not explicitly use the low-rank property in optimization. It
is proved that the recently proposed truncated nuclear norm (TNN) can replace
the traditional nuclear norm, as a better estimation to the rank of a matrix.
Thus, this paper presents a new method called the tensor truncated nuclear norm
(T-TNN), which proposes a new definition of tensor nuclear norm and extends the
truncated nuclear norm from the matrix case to the tensor case. Beneficial from
the low rankness of TNN, our approach improves the efficacy of tensor
completion. We exploit the previously proposed tensor singular value
decomposition and the alternating direction method of multipliers in
optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world videos and images demonstrate
that the performance of our approach is superior to those of existing methods.

high-dimensional ellipse against a compound alternative. Given samples of a
Gaussian random vector, the goal is to distinguish whether the mean is equal to
a known vector within an ellipse, or equal to some other unknown vector in the
ellipse. Such ellipse testing problems lie at the heart of several
applications, including non-parametric goodness-of-fit testing, signal
detection in cognitive radio, and regression function testing in reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces. While past work on such problems has focused on the
difficulty in a global sense, we study difficulty in a way that is localized to
each vector within the ellipse. Our main result is to give sharp upper and
lower bounds on the localized minimax testing radius in terms of an explicit
formula involving the Kolmogorov width of the ellipse intersected with a
Euclidean ball. When applied to particular examples, our general theorems yield
interesting rates that were not known before: as a particular case, for testing
in Sobolev ellipses of smoothness $\alpha$, we demonstrate rates that vary from
$(\sigma^2)^{\frac{4 \alpha}{4 \alpha + 1}}$, corresponding to the classical
global rate, to the faster rate $(\sigma^2)^{\frac{8
  \alpha}{8 \alpha + 1}}$, achievable for vectors at favorable locations within
the ellipse. We also show that the optimal test for this problem is achieved by
a linear projection test that is based on an explicit lower-dimensional
projection of the observation vector.

an unsupervised comparison of flow data sets. The starting point is two or more
attractors, i.e., ensembles of states representing different operating
conditions. The proposed metric generalizes the standard Hilbert-space distance
between two snapshots to snapshot ensembles of two attractors. A reduced-order
analysis for big data and many attractors is enabled by coarse-graining the
snapshots into representative clusters with corresponding centroids and
population probabilities. For a large number of attractors, MAO is augmented by
proximity maps for the snapshots, the centroids, and the attractors, giving
scientifically interpretable visual access to the closeness of the states. The
coherent structures belonging to the overlap and disjoint states between these
attractors are distilled by few representative centroids. We employ MAO for two
quite different actuated flow configurations: (1) a two-dimensional wake of the
fluidic pinball with vortices in a narrow frequency range and (2)
three-dimensional wall turbulence with broadband frequency spectrum manipulated
by spanwise traveling transversal surface waves. MAO compares and classifies
these actuated flows in agreement with physical intuition. For instance, the
first feature coordinate of the attractor proximity map correlates with drag
for the fluidic pinball and for the turbulent boundary layer. MAO has a large
spectrum of potential applications ranging from a quantitative comparison
between numerical simulations and experimental particle-image velocimetry data
to the analysis of simulations representing a myriad of different operating
conditions.

packages or empirical Feibelman d-parameters have been used to explore the
quantum correction of plasmonic resonances. However, most of these methods are
formulated within the quasi-static framework. The self-consistent hydrodynamics
model offers a reliable approach to study quantum plasmonics because it can
incorporate the quantum effect of the electron gas into classical
electrodynamics in a consistent manner. Instead of the standard scattering
method, we formulate the self-consistent hydrodynamics method as an eigenvalue
problem to study quantum plasmonics with electrons and photons treated on the
same footing. We find that the eigenvalue approach must involve a global
operator, which originates from the energy functional of the electron gas. This
manifests the intrinsic nonlocality of the response of quantum plasmonic
resonances. Our model gives the analytical forms of quantum corrections to
plasmonic modes, incorporating quantum electron spill-out effects and
electrodynamical retardation. We apply our method to study the quantum surface
plasmon polariton for a single flat interface.

classical conic sector theorem. Based on this modified conic sector theorem, we
design conic controllers that allow the closed-loop system to operate in
nonconic parameter regions for brief periods of time. Due to this extra degree
of freedom, these controllers lead to less conservative performance than
traditional designs, in which the controller parameters are chosen based on the
largest cone that the plant dynamics are contained in. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design in stabilizing a power grid with very high

to define positives and negatives. An object detector, trained with low IoU
threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection
performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main
factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to
exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch
between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input
hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is
proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors
trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective
against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage,
leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution
for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively
improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of
examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade
procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the
hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of
the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the
challenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is
widely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains
independently of the baseline detector strength. The code will be made

heavy quarks which do not undergo the coalescence process. The coalescence
process is tuned to have all charm quarks hadronizing in the $p_T\rightarrow 0$
limit and at finite $p_T$ charm quarks not undergoing coalescence are
hadronized by independent fragmentation. The $p_T$ dependence of the

express their attitudes toward various issues and show their unique interest.
Online voting imposes new challenges on recommendation, because the propagation
of votings heavily depends on the structure of social networks as well as the
content of votings. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize these two
factors in a comprehensive manner when doing voting recommendation. First, due
to the fact that existing text mining methods such as topic model and semantic
model cannot well process the content of votings that is typically short and
ambiguous, we propose a novel Topic-Enhanced Word Embedding (TEWE) method to
learn word and document representation by jointly considering their topics and
semantics. Then we propose our Joint Topic-Semantic-aware social Matrix
Factorization (JTS-MF) model for voting recommendation. JTS-MF model calculates
similarity among users and votings by combining their TEWE representation and
structural information of social networks, and preserves this
topic-semantic-social similarity during matrix factorization. To evaluate the
performance of TEWE representation and JTS-MF model, we conduct extensive
experiments on real online voting dataset. The results prove the efficacy of
our approach against several state-of-the-art baselines.

sentiment classification, however, text information can only disclose the ""tip
of the iceberg"" about users' true opinions, of which the most are unobserved
but implied by other sources of information such as social relation and users'
profile. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate how to predict
possibly existing sentiment links in the presence of heterogeneous information.
First, due to the lack of explicit sentiment links in mainstream social
networks, we establish a labeled heterogeneous sentiment dataset which consists
of users' sentiment relation, social relation and profile knowledge by
entity-level sentiment extraction method. Then we propose a novel and flexible
end-to-end Signed Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (SHINE) framework
to extract users' latent representations from heterogeneous networks and
predict the sign of unobserved sentiment links. SHINE utilizes multiple deep
autoencoders to map each user into a low-dimension feature space while
preserving the network structure. We demonstrate the superiority of SHINE over
state-of-the-art baselines on link prediction and node recommendation in two
real-world datasets. The experimental results also prove the efficacy of SHINE
in cold start scenario.

along with the corresponding images trigger a process to retrieve the relevant

employ dynamic memory networks to attend to the large body of facts in the

$R^2$. For X-ray pulsars, the standard has been the $Z^2$ statistic, which sums
over more than one harmonic. For $\gamma$-rays, the $H$-test, which optimizes
the number of harmonics to sum, is often used. These periodograms all suffer
from the same problem, namely artefacts caused by correlations in the Fourier
components that arise from testing frequencies with a non-integer number of
cycles. This article addresses this problem. The modified Rayleigh statistic is
discussed, its generalization to any harmonic, $\mathcal{R}^2_k$, is
formulated, and from the latter, the modified $Z^2$ statistic, $\mathcal{Z}^2$,
is constructed. Versions of these statistics for binned data and point
measurements are derived, and it is shown that the variance in the
uncertainties can have an important influence on the periodogram. It is shown
how to combine the information about the signal frequency from the different
harmonics to estimate its value with maximum accuracy. The methods are applied
to an $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ observation of the Crab pulsar for which a
decomposition of the pulse profile is presented, and shows that most of the
power is in the second, third, and fifth harmonics. The statistical detection
power of the $\mathcal{R}^2_k$ statistic is superior to the FFT and equivalent
to the Lomb-Scargle (LS). Response to gaps in the data is assessed, and it is
shown that the LS does not protect against the distortions they cause. The main
conclusion of this work is that the classical $R^2$ and $Z^2$ should be
replaced by $\mathcal{R}^2_k$ and $\mathcal{Z}^2$ in all applications with
event data, and the LS should be replaced by the $\mathcal{R}^2_k$ when the
uncertainty varies from one point measurement to another.

distributed functions f_i:{0,1}^n -> G, where G is an Abelian group, while the
function f:{0,1}^n -> G is kept secret to the parties. Ohsawa et al. in 2017
observed that any function f can be described as a linear combination of the
basis functions by regarding the function space as a vector space of dimension
2^n and gave new FSS schemes based on the Fourier basis. All existing FSS
schemes are of (p,p)-threshold type. That is, to compute f(x), we have to
collect f_i(x) for all the distributed functions. In this paper, as in the
secret sharing schemes, we consider FSS schemes with any general access
structure. To do this, we observe that Fourier-based FSS schemes by Ohsawa et

techniques of linear secret sharing with any general access structure into the

of applications. Although several algorithms have been developed, real-time and
adaptive methods are deficient for real-world tasks. In this paper, we address
this difficulty based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), and propose a
GAN-based restoration scheme (GAN-RS). In particular, we develop a multi-branch
discriminator including an adversarial branch and a critic branch for the
purpose of simultaneously preserving image content and removing underwater
noise. In addition to adversarial learning, a novel dark channel prior loss
also promotes the generator to produce realistic vision. More specifically, an
underwater index is investigated to describe underwater properties, and a loss
function based on the underwater index is designed to train the critic branch
for underwater noise suppression. Through extensive comparisons on visual
quality and feature restoration, we confirm the superiority of the proposed
approach. Consequently, the GAN-RS can adaptively improve underwater visual
quality in real time and induce an overall superior restoration performance.
Finally, a real-world experiment is conducted on the seabed for grasping marine
products, and the results are quite promising. The source code is publicly

efforts over the last two decades, the industrial adoption of haptic-assisted
VP/VA has been slower than expected. Putting hardware limitations aside, the
main roadblocks faced in software development can be traced to the lack of
effective and efficient computational models of haptic feedback. Such models
must 1) accommodate the inherent geometric complexities faced when assembling
objects of arbitrary shape; and 2) conform to the computation time limitation
imposed by the notorious frame rate requirements---namely, 1 kHz for haptic
feedback compared to the more manageable 30-60 Hz for graphic rendering. The
simultaneous fulfillment of these competing objectives is far from trivial.
  This survey presents some of the conceptual and computational challenges and

impose, and solve assembly constraints. Particular attention is given to the

the cobordism class of a $(4n+2)$-dimensional manifold $M^{4n+2}$ vanishes and
$M^{2^{t+1}-2}$ is of Kervaire invariant one if and only if
$h_t^2\in\mathrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\mathbb{Z}/2)$ is a permanent cycle. On the
other hand, according to Madsen if $4n+2\neq 2^t-2$ then $M^{4n+2}$ is
cobordant to a sphere (hence of Kervaire invariant zero) and $M^{2^{t+1}-2}$ is
not cobordant to a sphere (hence of Kervaire invariant one) if and only if
certain element $p_{2^{t}-1}^2\in H_*QS^0$ is spherical. Moreover, it is known
that $p_{2^t-1}^2$ is spherical if and only if $h_t^2$ is a permanent cycle in
the Adams spectral sequence. Moreover, classes $p_{2n+1}^2\in H_*QS^0$ with
$2n+1\neq 2^t-1$ are easily eliminated from being spherical. Hence, Browder's
theorem admits a presentation and proof in terms of certain square classes
being spherical in $H_*QS^0$ (see also work of Akhmetev and Eccles). In this
note, we consider the problem of determining spherical classes
$H_*\Omega^lS^{n+l}$ with $n>0$ and $4\leqslant l\leqslant +\infty$. We show
(1) if $\xi^2\in H_*\Omega^lS^{n+l}$ is given with $\dim\xi+1\neq 2^t$ and
$\dim \xi+1\equiv 2\textrm{ mod }4$ and $n>l$, then $\xi^2$ is not spherical.
We refer to this as a generalised Browder theorem. We also present some partial
results on the degenerate cases, corresponding to $\dim\xi\neq 2^t-1$, when
$l>n$. (2) For $l\in\{4,5,6,7,8\}$ the only spherical classes in
$H_*\Omega^lS^{n+l}$ arise from the inclusion of the bottom cell, or the Hopf
invariant one elements. This verifies Eccles conjecture when restricted to
finite loop spaces with $l<9$.

channel (AVWC), with respect to the maximal decoding error probability and
strong secrecy criterion, are considered, where the channel state sequence may
be known or unknown at the receiver. In the mean time, it is always assumed
that the channel state sequence is known at the eavesdropper and unknown at the
transmitter. Capacity results of both stochastic code (with random encoder and
deterministic decoder) and random code (with random encoder and decoder) are
discussed. This model includes the previous models of classic AVWC as special
cases. Single-letter lower bounds on the secrecy capacities are given, which
are proved to be the secrecy capacities when the main channel is less noisy
than the wiretap channel. The coding scheme is based on Csiszar's almost
independent coloring scheme and Ahlswede's elimination technique. Moreover, a
new kind of typical sequence with respect to states is defined for this coding
scheme. It is concluded that the secrecy capacity of stochastic code is
identical to that of random code when the receiver knows the state sequence.
Meanwhile, random code may achieve larger secrecy capacity when the state
sequence is unknown by the receiver.

distributed in GHz or higher frequency band, which would be optimal band for

high-frequency GWs(HFGWs) having additional polarizations. For the first time
we address:(1)concrete forms of analytic solutions for perturbed EM fields
caused by HFGWs having all six possible polarizations in background stable EM
fields; (2)perturbed EM signals of HFGWs with additional polarizations in
three-dimensional-synchro-resonance-system(3DSR system) and in
galactic-extragalactic background EM fields. These perturbative EM fields are
actually EM counterparts of HFGWs, and such results provide a novel way to
simultaneously distinguish and display all possible six polarizations. It is
also shown: (i)In EM response, pure cross-, x-type and pure y-type
polarizations can independently generate perturbative photon fluxes(PPFs,
signals), while plus-, b- and l-type polarizations produce PPFs in different
combination states. (ii) All such six polarizations have separability and
detectability. (iii)In EM response to HFGWs from extra-dimensions,
distinguishing and displaying different polarizations would be quite possible
due to their very high frequencies, large energy densities and special
properties of spectrum. (iv)Detection band(10^8 to 10^12 Hz or higher) of PPFs

The main purpose of these studies was to reveal the symmetry type of the order
parameter, which provides an important information about the mechanism of

and the sample size $n$ of the observations tend to be both large, and the
computation of the $U$-statistic is prohibitively demanding. Data-dependent
inferential procedures such as the empirical bootstrap for $U$-statistics is
even more computationally expensive. To overcome such computational bottleneck,
incomplete $U$-statistics obtained by sampling fewer terms of the $U$-statistic
are attractive alternatives. In this paper, we introduce randomized incomplete
$U$-statistics with sparse weights whose computational cost can be made
independent of the order of the $U$-statistic. We derive non-asymptotic
Gaussian approximation error bounds for the randomized incomplete
$U$-statistics in high dimensions, namely in cases where the dimension $d$ is
possibly much larger than the sample size $n$, for both non-degenerate and
degenerate kernels. In addition, we propose generic bootstrap methods for the
incomplete $U$-statistics that are computationally much less-demanding than
existing bootstrap methods, and establish finite sample validity of the
proposed bootstrap methods. Our methods are illustrated on the application to
nonparametric testing for the pairwise independence of a high-dimensional

size and number of simulation boxes was studied for large-scale phase-field
simulations. For this purpose, a reference simulation box was incrementally
partitioned. We have considered diffusion-controlled precipitation of delta
prime in a model Al-Li system from the growth stage until early ripening. The
results of the simulations show that decomposition of simulation box can be a
valuable computational technique to accelerate simulations without substantial
loss of accuracy. In the current case study, the precipitate density was found
to be the key controlling parameter. For a pre-set accuracy, it turned out that
large-scale simulations of the reference domain can be replaced by a
combination of smaller simulations. This shortens the required simulation time
and improves the memory usage of the simulation considerably, and thus
substantially increases the efficiency of massive parallel computation for
phase-field applications.

Here, we construct twoand three-dimensional tight-binding models realizable
with cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices, where the low energy excitations
are effectively described by the spin-1 Maxwell equations in the Hamiltonian
form. These relativistic (linear dispersion) excitations with unconventional
integer pseudospin, beyond the Dirac-Weyl-Majorana fermions, are an exotic kind
of fermions named asMaxwell fermions.We demonstrate that the systems have rich
topological features. For instance, the threefold degenerate points called
Maxwell points may have quantized Berry phases and anomalous quantum Hall
effects with spin-momentum locking may appear in topological Maxwell insulators
in the two-dimensional lattices. In three dimensions,Maxwell points may have
nontrivial monopole charges of \pm2 with two Fermi arcs connecting them, and
the merging of the Maxwell points leads to topological phase transitions.
Finally, we propose realistic schemes for realizing the model Hamiltonians and
detecting the topological properties of the emergent Maxwell quasiparticles in
optical lattices.

Our results clearly show two groups of three-dimensional bulk nodal lines

enforced to pin at the Fermi level by carrier compensation and constitute the
whole Fermi surfaces. This means that the carriers in ZrSiS are entirely

observe two different time regimes. For slow foldings (regime I) the diffusion
evolves very slowly with the folding time, while for rapid foldings (regime II)
the diffusion increases strongly with the folding time suggesting two different
physical mechanisms. We find that in regime I the motor displacement during the
folding process is counteracted by a reverse displacement during the unfolding,
while in regime II this counteraction is much weaker. We notice that regime I
behavior is reminiscent of the scallop theorem that holds for larger motors in
a continuous medium. We find that the difference in the efficiency of the motor
motion explains most of the observed difference between the two regimes. For
fast foldings the motor trajectories differ significantly from the opposite
trajectories induced by the following unfolding process, resulting in a more
efficient global motion than for slow foldings. This result agrees with the
fluctuation theorems expectation for time reversal mechanisms. In agreement
with the fluctuation theorems we find that the motors are unexpectedly more
efficient when they are generating more entropy, a result that can be used to
increase dramatically the motor motion.

purpose of clarifying topics in experimental Bell scenarios. Because Bell
scenarios are interested in quantum effects between nonlocal measurement
devices, we assign an observer to each device: Alice and Bob. Given that the
observers are stationary and space-like separated, each observer is privy to
different information along their shared equi-temporal lines due to
permutations in the order they observe events. Therefore, each observer is
inclined to assign different probability distributions to the same set of
propositions due to these informational differences. The observers are
obligated to update their probability distributions on the basis of locally
observed events, and in this sense, factuality is informational locality. In
this framework, only local variables or detections may be factual, but nothing
prevents an observer from inquiring or making if-then inferences on the
counterfactual basis of a nonlocal proposition being true. Indeed the objects
pertaining to these nonlocal counterfactual propositions may be far outside an
observer's light cone. The MOPA arrives at the conclusion that the CHSH
inequality is only nonlocally violated ""counterfactually"" by each observer
whereas local violations of the CHSH may be factual or counterfactual. We
believe the MOPA to better gel probability theory (and thus QM) with Special
Relativity than does the standard locality conditions imposed in the Bell and
CHSH inequalities. The no-signaling condition is reinterpreted, and perhaps
further clarified, in the MOPA and statements about counterfactuality and
observer dependent QM are made.

hour from 8pm to 12am, they were prompted to use the app to report alcohol
consumption and complete a 5-step straight-line walking task, during which
3-axis acceleration and angular velocity data was sampled at a frequency of 100

standard deviation. Using an artificial neural network (ANN), we performed
regression analysis to define a model determining association between gait
features and BACs. 70\% of data was used as a training dataset, and the results

$\pi\sigma^*$ states of pyrrole and their interaction with each other and with
the ground electronic state $\tilde{X}$ are studied using ab initio quantum
mechanics. New 24-dimensional potential energy surfaces for the
photodissociation of the N-H bond and the formation of the pyrrolyl radical are
calculated using the CASPT2 method for the electronic states
$\tilde{X}(\pi\pi)$, $1^1A_2(\pi\sigma^*)$ and $1^1B_1(\pi\sigma^*)$ and
locally diabatized. In the first paper, the ab initio calculations are
described and the photodissociation in the state $1^1A_2(\pi\sigma^*)$ is
analyzed. The excitation $1^1A_2 \leftarrow \tilde{X}$ is mediated by the
coordinate dependent transition dipole moment functions constructed using the
Herzberg-Teller expansion. Nuclear dynamics, including 6, 11, and 15 active
degrees of freedom, is studied using the multi-configurational time-dependent
Hartree method. The focus is on the frequency resolved absorption spectrum, as
well as on the dissociation time scales and the resonance lifetimes.
Calculations are compared with available experimental data. An approximate
convolution method is developed and validated, with which absorption spectra
can be calculated and assigned in terms of vibrational quantum numbers. The
method represents the total absorption spectrum as a convolution of the diffuse
spectrum of the detaching H-atom and the Franck-Condon spectrum of the
heteroaromatic ring. Convolution calculation requires a minimal quantum
chemical input and is a promising tool for studying the $\pi\sigma^*$
photodissociation in model biochromophores.

often seek for external resources from outsourcing partners. Little is known
how this outsourcing relationship works and whether it makes sense to outsource
the technical competence to an external party. This is among the first
investigations on the outsourcing relationships in software startups. By
conducting exploratory case studies at six startups, we found a mixed
experience with outsourcing. The experimental nature of an early product
development makes outsourcing a feasible option, although startups often suffer
from its uncertainty and managing commitments from partners. Results further
propose that early contract-based activities could be transformed into a
long-term partnership by adopting a startup boundary spanner s role,
establishing an inter-personal relationship and maintaining a mutual
commitment.

engineering and medical applications. A material can be processed with specific
mechanical properties, microstructure, and surface texture by controlling the
parameters of magnetron sputtering. Therefore, studies should be conducted on
investigating the processing conditions on the performance of nanomaterials
processed by magnetron sputtering. In this study, effects of the processing
force on performance of micro/nano-resonators produced by magnetron sputtering
are revealed. The processing force is defined as the ratio of the sputtering
power-to-the substrates traveling velocity. By comparing the substrate
traveling velocity to the deposition rate of the sputtered particles, relations
are derived for the thickness and surface texture evolutions with the
processing force. The coefficients of these relations are experimentally
determined for mechanical resonators made of FeNiCr alloy. Then, the variations
of the natural frequencies of these resonators with the processing force of
magnetron sputtering and the deposition rate of the sputtered particles are
depicted. It is demonstrated that special considerations should be given for
the effects of the processing conditions when design mechanical resonators
produced by magnetron sputtering.

deformation patterns of materials. A positive Poisson ratio is a feature of the
majority of materials. Some materials, however, display auxetic behaviors (i.e.
possess negative Poisson ratios). Indeed, auxetic and non-auxetic materials
display different deformation mechanisms. Revealing these differences and their
effects on the mechanics of these materials is of a significant importance. In
this study, effects of Poisson ratio on the mechanics of auxetic and
non-auxetic nanobeams are revealed. A parametric study is provided on effects
of Poisson ratio on the static bending and free vibration behaviors of auxetic
nanobeams. The general nonlocal theory is employed to model the nonlocal
effects. Unlike Eringen nonlocal theory, the general nonlocal theory uses
different attenuation functions for the longitudinal and lateral strains. This
theory can reveal the Poisson ratio-nonlocal coupling effects on the mechanics
of nanomaterials. The obtained results showed that Poisson ratio is an
essential parameter for determining mechanical behaviors of nanobeams. It is
revealed that auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams may reflect softening or
hardening behaviors depending on the ratio of the nonlocal fields of the
longitudinal and lateral strains of the beam.

  solution","17 Pages, 3 Figures and 1 Table",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paradoxes of differential nonlocal models have been attributed to the
inconsistency in forming the nonlocal boundary conditions. To overcome these
paradoxes, nonlocal boundary conditions should be correctly formed. However,
still forming these boundary conditions for differential nonlocal models is a
challenging task. To resolve the trouble, in this study, the iterative nonlocal
residual approach is employed. In the context of this approach, the field
equation is solved in the local field with an imposed nonlocal residuals. This
nonlocal residual is iteratively formed (not determined) depending on a
pre-determined local field. The iterative nonlocal residual approach permits
applying the local boundary conditions. Thus, the paradoxes of differential
nonlocal models due to the nonlocal boundary conditions are effectively solved.
The paradoxes of differential nonlocal models and reasons behind them are
discussed. Moreover, a nonlocal beam model based on the iterative nonlocal
residual approach is proposed. This nonlocal beam model is employed to
investigate the static bending and free vibration of differential nonlocal
cantilever beams. Comparisons between the results of the iterative nonlocal
residual approach and results of integral nonlocal beam models are carried out.
It is demonstrated that the iterative nonlocal residual approach gives the same
results as integral nonlocal models.

  Binarized Networks",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations for Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) have been adopted in many systems because of their
higher classification speed. However, although they may be characterized by
better accuracy, larger DNNs require significant energy and area, thereby
limiting their wide adoption. The energy consumption of DNNs is driven by both
memory accesses and computation. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), as a
trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption, can achieve great energy
reduction, and have good accuracy for large DNNs due to its regularization
effect. However, BNNs show poor accuracy when a smaller DNN configuration is
adopted. In this paper, we propose a new DNN model, LightNN, which replaces the
multiplications to one shift or a constrained number of shifts and adds. For a
fixed DNN configuration, LightNNs have better accuracy at a slight energy
increase than BNNs, yet are more energy efficient with only slightly less
accuracy than conventional DNNs. Therefore, LightNNs provide more options for
hardware designers to make trade-offs between accuracy and energy. Moreover,
for large DNN configurations, LightNNs have a regularization effect, making
them better in accuracy than conventional DNNs. These conclusions are verified
by experiment using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for different DNN
configurations.
