relativity, there exists exotic mechanisms that can convert the spin energy of
black holes into gravitational waves. Such waves may be very weak in amplitude,
since the spin-down could take a long time, and a direct search may not be
feasible. We propose to search for the stochastic background associated with
the spin-down, and we relate the level of this background to the formation rate
of spinning black holes from the merger of binary black holes, as well as the
energy spectrum of waves emitted by the spin-down process. We argue that
current LIGO-Virgo observations are not inconsistent with the existence of a
spin-down process, as long as it is slow enough. On the other hand, the
background may still exist as long as a moderate fraction of spin energy is
emitted within Hubble time. This stochastic background could be one interesting
target of next generation GW detector network, such as LIGO Voyager, and could
be extracted from total stochastic background.

folding models and force fields have been developed, yet all face difficulties
converging to native conformations. Hydrophobicity scales (HSs) play a crucial
role in such simulations as they define the energetic interactions between
protein residues, thus determining the energetically favorable conformation.
While many HSs have been developed over the years using various methods, it is
surprising that the scales show very weak consensus in their assignment of
hydrophobicity indexes to the various residues. In this work, several HSs are
systematically assessed via atomistic Monte Carlo simulation of folding of
small proteins, by converting the HSs of interest into residue-residue contact
energy matrices. HSs that poorly preserve native structures of proteins were
tuned by applying a linear transformation. Subsequently, folding simulations
were used to examine the ability of the HSs to correctly fold the proteins from
a random initial conformation. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and energy of
the proteins during folding were sampled and used to define an ER-score, as the
correlation between the 2-dimensional energy-RMSD (ER) histogram with 50%
lowest energy conformations and the ER histogram with 50% lowest RMSD
conformations. Thus, we were able to compare the ability of the different HSs
to predict de novo protein folding quantitatively.

that are insoluble and resistant to protease activity. Abnormal formation of
amyloid fibrils in vivo may lead to neurodegenerative disorders and other
systemic amyloidosis such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and atherosclerosis.
Because of their clinical importance amyloids are found under intense
scientific research. Amyloidogenic sequences of short polypeptide segments
within proteins are responsible for the transformation of correctly folded
proteins into parts of larger amyloid fibrils. The {\alpha}-helical secondary
structure is believed to host many amyloidogenic sequences and be a key player
in different stages of the amyloidogenesis process. Most of the studies on
amyloids focus on the role of amyloidogenic sequences. The focus of this study
is the relation between amyloidogenicity and the structure of the amyloidogenic
{\alpha}-helical sequence. We have previously shown that the {\alpha}-helical
conformation may be expressed by two parameters ({\theta} and \{rho}) that form
orthogonal coordinates based on the Ramachandran dihedrals ({\phi} and {\psi})
and provide an illuminating interpretation of the {\alpha}-helical
conformation. By performing statistical analysis on {\alpha}-helical
conformations found in the protein data bank, an apparent relation between
{\alpha}-helical conformation, as expressed by {\theta} and \{rho}, and
amyloidogenicity is revealed. Remarkably, random amino acid sequences, whose
helical structure was obtained from the most probably dihedral angles as
obtained from PDB data, revealed the same dependency of amyloidogenicity,
suggesting the importance of {\alpha}-helical structure as opposed to sequence.

analyze the potential performance gains using oracle priors derived from

well as low temperatures and is formulated in a highly efficient way by
utilizing dynamically optimized single-particle basis states and representing
the RDMs in terms of permanents with respect to those. An energy, RDM
compatibility and symmetry conserving closure approximation is developed on the
basis of a recursively formulated cluster expansion for these finite systems.
In order to enforce necessary representability conditions, two novel,
minimal-invasive and energy-conserving correction algorithms are proposed,
involving the dynamical purification of the solution of the truncated BBGKY
hierarchy and the correction of the equations of motion themselves,
respectively. For gaining conceptual insights, the impact of two-particle

apply this theoretical framework to both a tunneling and an interaction-quench

truncation orders as large as twelve and thereby systematically study the

means of the Lomb-Scargle and Phase Dispersion Minimization methods. In order
to obtain a reliable rotation period and its error value, computational

is improved to be 9.29572(12) days by using the five-year of combined data set.
Also, the light elements are calculated as $HJD_\mathrm{max} =
2\,454\,715.975(11) + 9_{\cdot}^\mathrm{d}29572(12) \times E +
9_{\cdot}^\mathrm{d}78(1.13) \times 10^{-8} \times E^2$ by means of the
extremum times derived from the {\sl STEREO} light curves and archives.
Moreover, with this study, a period variation is revealed for the first time,
and it is found that the period has lengthened by 0.66(8) s y$^{-1}$,
equivalent to 66 seconds per century. Additionally, a time-scale for a possible
spin-down is calculated around $\tau_\mathrm{SD} \sim 10^6$ yr. The
differential rotation and magnetic braking are thought to be responsible of the
mentioned rotational deceleration. It is deduced that the spin-down time-scale
of the star is nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than its main-sequence

the process of increase in the period might be reversible.

the integrable design of coherent ultrashort light pulse code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) technique, also known as femtosecond CDMA, using
all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs). In this technique, the data bits are firstly
modulated using ultrashort femtosecond optical pulses generated by mode-locked
lasers, and then by employing a unique phase metamask for each data stream, in
order to provide the multiple access capability, the optical signals are
spectrally encoded. This procedure spreads the optical signal in the temporal
domain and generates low-intensity pseudo-noise bursts through random phase
coding leading to minimized multiple access interference. This paper
comprehensively presents the principles and design approach to realize
fundamental components of a typical femtosecond CDMA encoder, including the
grating, lens, and phase mask, by employing high-contrast CMOS-compatible MSs.
By controlling the interference between the provided Mie and Fabry-Perot
resonance modes, we tailor the spectral and spatial responses of the impinging
light locally and independently. Accordingly, we design a MS-based grating with
the highest possible refracted angle and, in the meantime, the maximized
efficiency which results in a reasonable diameter for the subsequent lens.
Moreover, to design our MS-based lens commensurate with the spot size and
distance requirements of the pursuant phase mask, we leverage a new
optimization method which splits the lens structure into central and peripheral
parts, and then design the peripheral part using a collection of gratings
converging the impinging at the subsequent phase mask.

reticulated foams with varying pore size and thickness, but constant porosity
($\epsilon \approx 0.97$). The foams were flush-mounted into a cutout on a flat
plate. A Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) was used to measure mean streamwise
velocity and turbulence intensity immediately upstream of the porous section,
and at multiple measurement stations along the porous substrate. The friction
Reynolds number upstream of the porous section was $Re_\tau \approx 1690$. For
all but the thickest foam tested, the internal boundary layer was fully
developed by $<10 \delta$ downstream from the porous transition, where $\delta$
is the boundary layer thickness. Fully developed mean velocity profiles showed
the presence of a substantial slip velocity at the porous interface ($>30\%$ of
the free stream velocity) and a mean velocity deficit relative to the canonical
smooth-wall profile further from the wall. While the magnitude of the mean
velocity deficit increased with average pore size, the slip velocity remained
approximately constant. Fits to the mean velocity profile suggest that the
logarithmic region is shifted relative to a smooth wall, and that this shift
increases with pore size until it becomes comparable to substrate thickness
$h$. For all foams, the turbulence intensity was found to be elevated further
into the boundary layer to $y/ \delta \approx 0.2$. An outer peak in intensity
was also evident for the largest pore sizes. Velocity spectra indicate that
this outer peak is associated with large-scale structures resembling
Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices that have streamwise length scale $2\delta-4\delta$.
Skewness profiles suggest that these large-scale structures may have an
amplitude-modulating effect on the interfacial turbulence.

to provide clinically actionable insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and
treatment. Computational methods aid the discovery by relying on
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. They start with a few known
disease-associated proteins and aim to find the rest of the pathway by
exploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the
success of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well
understood. Here we study the PPI network structure of 519 disease pathways. We
find that 90% of pathways do not correspond to single well-connected components
in the PPI network. Instead, proteins associated with a single disease tend to
form many separate connected components/regions in the network. We then
evaluate state-of-the-art disease pathway discovery methods and show that their
performance is especially poor on diseases with disconnected pathways. Thus, we
conclude that network connectivity structure alone may not be sufficient for
disease pathway discovery. However, we show that higher-order network
structures, such as small subgraphs of the pathway, provide a promising
direction for the development of new methods.

remains sparsely dispersed among escort advertisements and difficult to
identify due to its often-latent nature. The use of intelligent systems to
detect trafficking can thus have a direct impact on investigative resource
allocation and decision-making, and, more broadly, help curb a widespread
social problem. Trafficking detection involves assigning a normalized score to
a set of escort advertisements crawled from the Web -- a higher score indicates
a greater risk of trafficking-related (involuntary) activities. In this paper,
we define and study the problem of trafficking detection and present a
trafficking detection pipeline architecture developed over three years of
research within the DARPA Memex program. Drawing on multi-institutional data,
systems, and experiences collected during this time, we also conduct post hoc
bias analyses and present a bias mitigation plan. Our findings show that, while
automatic trafficking detection is an important application of AI for social
good, it also provides cautionary lessons for deploying predictive machine
learning algorithms without appropriate de-biasing. This ultimately led to
integration of an interpretable solution into a search system that contains
over 100 million advertisements and is used by over 200 law enforcement
agencies to investigate leads.

generalized dark photon interacting with matter through a linear combination
(\epsilon_Q Q + \epsilon_B B+\epsilon_L L) e, involving B-L in a grand-unified
theory, presumably through B-L-.61 Q, inducing effectively a very small
repulsive force between neutrons.
  This new force, if long-ranged, may manifest through apparent violations of

4 digital libraries, then we extracted data from each PS according to a
predefined data extraction sheet. The results of our data analysis showed that
not all of the constructed networks used in the PSs were valid as the edges of
these networks did not reflect a real relationship between the entities of the
network. Additionally, the used measures in the PSs were in many cases not
suitable for the used networks. Also, the reported analysis results by the PSs
were not, in most cases, validated using any statistical model. Finally, many
of the PSs did not provide lessons or guidelines for software practitioners
that can improve the software engineering practices. Although employing network
analysis in mining developers' collaboration showed some satisfactory results
in some of the PSs, the application of network analysis needs to be conducted
more carefully. That is said, the constructed network should be representative
and meaningful, the used measure needs to be suitable for the context, and the
validation of the results should be considered. More and above, we state some
research gaps, in which network science can be applied, with some pointers to
recent advances that can be used to mine collaboration networks.

affected by climatological changes. As the season length for shorefast ice
decreases and temperatures warm permafrost soils, coastlines are more
susceptible to erosion from storm waves. Such coastal erosion is a concern,
since the majority of the population centers and infrastructure in the Arctic
are located near the coasts. Stakeholders and decision makers increasingly need
models capable of scenario-based predictions to assess and mitigate the effects
of coastal morphology on infrastructure and land use. Our research uses
Gaussian process models to forecast Arctic coastal erosion along the Beaufort
Sea near Drew Point, AK. Gaussian process regression is a data-driven modeling
methodology capable of extracting patterns and trends from data-sparse
environments such as remote Arctic coastlines. To train our model, we use
annual coastline positions and near-shore summer temperature averages from
existing datasets and extend these data by extracting additional coastlines
from satellite imagery. We combine our calibrated models with future climate
models to generate a range of plausible future erosion scenarios. Our results
show that the Gaussian process methodology substantially improves yearly
predictions compared to linear and nonlinear least squares methods, and is
capable of generating detailed forecasts suitable for use by decision makers.

the energy in the center of mass (CM) frame of two colliding particles in the
vicinity of its horizon, which is known as the Ba\~nados, Silk and West (BSW)

for certain values of the conserved energy outside the horizon, it will never
reach the event horizon; therefore, the black hole can not act as a particle
accelerator with arbitrarily high CM energy on the event horizon. However, such
particle could also exist inside the outer horizon being the BSW process
possible on the inner horizon. On the other hand, for the extremal warped
AdS$_{3}$ black hole, the particle with $L_c$ and energy $E$ could exist
outside the event horizon and the CM energy blows up on the event horizon if

understood in a minimal framework where the Standard Model (SM) is supplemented
by a stable SM singlet scalar as dark matter (DM) and type II seesaw for
generating the neutrino mass matrix. In our framework, a pair of DM particles
annihilates into a pair of the SM SU(2) triplet scalars ($\Delta$s) in type II
seesaw, and the subsequent $\Delta$ decays create the primary source of the
excessive CREs around $1.4$ TeV. The lepton flavor structure of the primary
source of CREs has a direct relationship with the neutrino oscillation data. We
find that the DM interpretation of the DAMPE excess determines the pattern of
neutrino mass spectrum to be the inverted hierarchy type, taking into account
the constraints from the Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

gravity, quantised in the standard manner. This gives a systematic
two-parameter perturbative expansion organised by small parameters $G_N$ and
the inverse mass of the particle, complementary to the usual Witten diagram
expansion. This connects closely to CFT language, with the geodesic Witten
diagram representation of global conformal blocks emerging naturally, and for
two dimensions gives a bulk representation of the Virasoro block, with a

have been considered to be coupled by van der Waals (vdW) interactions.
However, based on first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we
here propose a different bonding nature between neighboring chains: i.e., the
helical chains made of normal covalent bonds are connected together by
coordinate covalent bonds. It is revealed that the lone pairs of electrons of
Te atom participate in forming coordinate covalent bonds between neighboring
chains. Therefore, each Te atom behaves as both electron donor to neighboring
chains and electron acceptor from neighboring chains. This ligand-metal-like
bonding nature in bulk Te results in the same order of bulk moduli along the
directions parallel and perpendicular to the chains, contrasting with the large
anisotropy of bulk moduli in vdW crystals. We further find that the electron
effective masses parallel and perpendicular to the chains are almost the same
each other, consistent with the observed nearly isotropic electrical
resistivity. It is thus demonstrated that the normal/coordinate covalent bonds
parallel/perpendicular to the chains in bulk Te lead to a minor anisotropy in
structural and transport properties, distinct from a strong anisotropy observed
in the typical two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials such as graphite and MoS$_2$.

estimated by the standard $L^2$-type filter (e.g. Kalman/minimax filter) which
uses Gaussian/ellipsoidal uncertainty description and observations (if any)

conditioned on a given photo/sketch. It is of wide applications including
digital entertainment and law enforcement. Precisely depicting face
photos/sketches remains challenging due to the restrictions on structural
realism and textural consistency. While existing methods achieve compelling
results, they mostly yield blurred effects and great deformation over various
facial components, leading to the unrealistic feeling of synthesized images. To
tackle this challenge, in this work, we propose to use the facial composition
information to help the synthesis of face sketch/photo. Specially, we propose a
novel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for face
photo-sketch synthesis. In CA-GAN, we utilize paired inputs including a face
photo/sketch and the corresponding pixel-wise face labels for generating a
sketch/photo. In addition, to focus training on hard-generated components and
delicate facial structures, we propose a compositional reconstruction loss.
Finally, we use stacked CA-GANs (SCA-GAN) to further rectify defects and add
compelling details. Experimental results show that our method is capable of
generating both visually comfortable and identity-preserving face
sketches/photos over a wide range of challenging data. Our method achieves the
state-of-the-art quality, reducing best previous Frechet Inception distance
(FID) by a large margin. Besides, we demonstrate that the proposed method is of
considerable generalization ability. We have made our code and results publicly

over links is adopted because of the resulting closed forms for performance
metrics, and in spite of the well-known fact that the shadowing fields of
networks are spatially correlated. The main purpose of this paper is to
challenge this independent shadowing approximation. For this, we analyze the
interference measured at the origin in networks where 1) nodes which are in the
same cell of some random shadowing tessellation share the same shadow, or 2)
nodes which share a common mother point in some cluster process share the same
shadow. By leveraging stochastic comparison techniques, we give the order
relation of the three main user performance metrics, namely coverage
probability, Shannon throughput and local delay, under both the correlated and
the independent shadowing assumptions. We show that the evaluation of the
considered metrics under the independent approximation is systematically
pessimistic compared to the correlated shadowing model. The improvement in each

the ordinary derivative in the definition of the field strength F_{\mu}{\nu}

derivatives should be adopted. This view was further emphasized by Hehl and

the adoption and promotion of businesses is becoming more and more dependent on
how the customers are interacting and feeling about the business on platforms

an important source of information about different businesses. Social influence
on these online platforms can result in individuals adopting or promoting ideas
and actions resulting in information cascades. Research on information cascades
have been gaining popularity over the last few years but most of the research
has been focused on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Research on the
adoption or promotion of product using cascades can help determine important
latent patterns of social influence.
  In this work, we have analyzed the spread of information i.e. cascades in
Yelp across different cities in Europe and North America. We have enumerated
and analyzed different cascade topologies that occur in the Yelp social
networks. Some of our significant findings include the presence of a
significant number of cascades in Yelp reviews indicating the importance of
social influence, heavy-tailed distribution of cascades and possibility to
accurately predict the size of cascades on the basis of initial reviews. In
addition, we have also found that the characteristics of the non-root nodes and
the non-root reviews are much more important type of feature as compared to the
properties of the root nodes and root reviews of the cascade.
  These findings can help social scientists to analyze customer behavior across
different cities in a much more systematic way. Furthermore, it can also help
the businesses in a city to figure out different consumer trends and hence
improve their processes and offerings.

from slower memory to faster cache before it is actually required by
processors. Sophisticated prefetchers predict next use cache line by repeating
program's historical spatial and temporal memory access pattern. However, they
are error prone and the mis-predictions lead to cache pollution and exert extra
pressure on memory subsystem. In this paper, a novel scheme of data cache
prefetching with perceptron learning is proposed. The key idea is a two-level
prefetching mechanism. A primary decision is made by utilizing previous
table-based prefetching mechanism, e.g. stride prefetching or Markov
prefetching, and then, a neural network, perceptron is taken to detect and
trace program memory access patterns, to help reject those unnecessary
prefetching decisions. The perceptron can learn from both local and global
history in time and space, and can be easily implemented by hardware. This
mechanism boost execution performance by ideally mitigating cache pollution and
eliminating redundant memory request issued by prefetcher. Detailed evaluation
and analysis were conducted based on SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks. The simulation
results show that generally the proposed scheme yields a geometric mean of

self-interference at the base station and uplink-to-downlink interference at
the downlink user. Although uplink-to-downlink interference is typically
treated as noise, it is shown that successive interference decoding and

proposed temporal fair user scheduling algorithm and corresponding power
optimization utilizes full-duplex and SIC modes as well as half-duplex

with participation in the regular rotation of the Galactic disc. Previous
attempts to create a homogeneous all-sky HI map of HVCs have been hampered by a
combination of poor angular resolution, limited surface brightness sensitivity
and suboptimal sampling. Here, a new and improved HI map of Galactic HVCs based
on the all-sky HI4PI survey is presented. The new map is fully sampled and
provides significantly better angular resolution (16.2 versus 36 arcmin) and
column density sensitivity (2.3 versus 3.7 * 10^18 cm^-2 at the native
resolution) than the previously available LAB survey. The new HVC map resolves
many of the major HVC complexes in the sky into an intricate network of narrow
HI filaments and clumps that were not previously resolved by the LAB survey.
The resulting sky coverage fraction of high-velocity HI emission above a column
density level of 2 * 10^18 cm^-2 is approximately 15 per cent, which reduces to
about 13 per cent when the Magellanic Clouds and other non-HVC emission are
removed. The differential sky coverage fraction as a function of column density
obeys a truncated power law with an exponent of -0.93 and a turnover point at
about 5 * 10^19 cm^-2. HI column density and velocity maps of the HVC sky are
made publicly available as FITS images for scientific use by the community.

challenging problem requiring feedback controllers to enforce safety-critical

work, a deep visual perception model is designed to accurately estimate step
length of the next step, which serves as input to the feedback controller to
enable vision-in-the-loop dynamic walking on discrete terrain. In particular, a
custom convolutional neural network architecture is designed and trained to
predict step length to the next foothold using a sampled image preview of the
upcoming terrain at foot impact. The visual input is offered only at the
beginning of each step and is shown to be sufficient for the job of dynamically
stepping onto discrete footholds. Through extensive numerical studies, we show
that the robot is able to successfully autonomously walk for over 100 steps
without failure on a discrete terrain with footholds randomly positioned within
a step length range of 45-85 centimeters.

knapsack problem in which the algorithm designer is given a a knapsack with a
given capacity and a collection of items where each item is associated with a
profit and a probability distribution on its size. The goal is to select a
subset of items with maximum profit and violate the capacity constraint with
probability at most $p$ (referred to as the overflow probability). While
several approximation algorithms have been developed for this problem, most of
these algorithms relax the capacity constraint of the knapsack. In this paper,
we design efficient approximation schemes for this problem without relaxing the
capacity constraint.
  (i) Our first result is in the case when item sizes are Bernoulli random
variables. In this case, we design a (nearly) fully polynomial time
approximation scheme (FPTAS) which only relaxes the overflow probability. (ii)
Our second result generalizes the first result to the case when all the item
sizes are supported on a (common) set of constant size. (iii) Our third result
is in the case when item sizes are so-called ""hypercontractive"" random
variables i.e., random variables whose second and fourth moments are within
constant factors of each other. In other words, the kurtosis of the random
variable is upper bounded by a constant.
  Crucially, all of our algorithms meet the capacity constraint exactly, a
result which was previously known only when the item sizes were Poisson or
Gaussian random variables. Our results rely on new connections between Boolean
function analysis and stochastic optimization. We believe that these ideas and
techniques may prove to be useful in other stochastic optimization problems as
well.

public health due to their consequences for individual-level infection risk and
disease progression. However, a clear understanding of the population-level
consequences of co-infection is lacking. Here, we constructed a model that
includes three individual-level effects of co-infection: mortality, fecundity,
and transmission. We used the model to investigate how these individual-level
consequences of co-infection scale up to produce population-level infection
patterns. To parameterize this model, we conducted a four-year cohort study in
African buffalo to estimate the individual-level effects of co-infection with
two bacterial pathogens, bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and brucellosis, across a
range of demographic and environmental contexts. At the individual-level, our
empirical results identified BTB as a risk factor for acquiring brucellosis,
but we found no association between brucellosis and the risk of acquiring BTB.
Both infections were associated with reductions in survival and neither
infection was associated with reductions in fecundity. Results of the model
reproduce co-infection patterns in the data and predict opposite impacts of
co-infection at individual and population scales: whereas BTB facilitated
brucellosis infection at the individual-level, our model predicts the presence
of brucellosis to have a strong negative impact on BTB at the population-level.
In modeled populations where brucellosis is present, the endemic prevalence and
basic reproduction number (Ro) of BTB were lower than in populations without
brucellosis. Therefore, these results provide a data-driven example of
competition between co-infecting pathogens that occurs when one pathogen
facilitates secondary infections at the individual level.

facilitates the onset of phase-flip bifurcation/transitions among the coupled

asynchronization among the out-of-phase synchronized oscillators at this onset.
This leads to the manifestation of coexisting out-of-phase synchronized
coherent domains interspersed by asynchronous incoherent domains elucidating
the existence of a different type of chimera state. In addition to this, a rich
variety of other collective behaviors such as clusters with phase-flip
transition, conventional chimera, solitary state and com- plete synchronized

performance. However, CNN-based methods tend to restore high-resolution results
highly depending on traditional interpolations (e.g. bicubic). In this paper,
we present a deep sampling network (DSN) for down-sampling and up-sampling
without any cheap interpolation. First, the down-sampling subnetwork is trained
without supervision, thereby preserving more information and producing better
visual effects in the low-resolution image. Second, the up-sampling subnetwork
learns a sub-pixel residual with dense connections to accelerate convergence
and improve performance. DSN's down-sampling subnetwork can be used to generate
photo-realistic low-resolution images and replace traditional down-sampling
method in image processing. With the powerful down-sampling process, the
co-training DSN set a new state-of-the-art performance for image
super-resolution. Moreover, DSN is compatible with existing image codecs to
improve image compression.

architecture is required for robots to understand the environment through a
variety of sensors with which they are equipped. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework named Serket that enables the construction of a large-scale
generative model and its inference easily by connecting sub-modules to allow
the robots to acquire various capabilities through interaction with their
environments and others. We consider that large-scale cognitive models can be
constructed by connecting smaller fundamental models hierarchically while
maintaining their programmatic independence. Moreover, connected modules are
dependent on each other, and parameters are required to be optimized as a
whole. Conventionally, the equations for parameter estimation have to be
derived and implemented depending on the models. However, it becomes harder to
derive and implement those of a larger scale model. To solve these problems, in
this paper, we propose a method for parameter estimation by communicating the
minimal parameters between various modules while maintaining their programmatic
independence. Therefore, Serket makes it easy to construct large-scale models
and estimate their parameters via the connection of modules. Experimental
results demonstrated that the model can be constructed by connecting modules,
the parameters can be optimized as a whole, and they are comparable with the
original models that we have proposed.

emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), while the observed
spectral energy distributions decline longward of 24 micron, suggesting that
very small grains (VSGs) are deficient. These characteristics of the observed

quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) for both isotropic and more importantly,
anisotropic expansion. In this approach, we rapidly determine a crystal's
equilibrium volume and shape at a given temperature by integrating along the
gradient of expansion from zero Kelvin up to the desired temperature. We
compare our approach to previous isotropic methods that rely on a brute-force
grid search to determine the free energy minimum, which is infeasible to carry
out for anisotropic expansion, as well as quasi-anisotropic approaches that
take into account the contributions to anisotropic expansion from the lattice
energy. We compare these methods for experimentally known polymorphs of
piracetam and resorcinol and show that both isotropic methods agree to within
error up to 300 K. Using the Gr\""{u}neisen parameter causes up to 0.04 kcal/mol
deviation in the Gibbs free energy, but for polymorph free energy differences
there is a cancellation in error with all isotropic methods within 0.025
kcal/mol at 300 K.
  Anisotropic expansion allows the crystals to relax into lattice geometries
0.01-0.23 kcal/mol lower in energy at 300 K relative to isotropic expansion.
For polymorph free energy differences all QHA methods produced results within
0.02 kcal/mol of each other for resorcinol and 0.12 kcal/mol for piracetam, the
two molecules tested here, demonstrating a cancellation of error for isotropic
methods.
  We also find that when expanding in more than a single volume variable, there
is a non-negligible rate of failure of the basic approximations of QHA.
Specifically, while expanding into new harmonic modes as the box vectors are
increased, the system often falls into alternate, structurally distinct
harmonic modes unrelated by continuous deformation from the original harmonic
mode.

single roadside infrastructure unit to a group of vehicles passing by it. To
combat the short connection time and the lossy channel quality, the downloaded
contents need to be further shared among vehicles after the initial
broadcasting phase. To this end, we propose a joint infrastructure-to-vehicle
(I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scheme based on batched sparse
(BATS) coding to minimize the traffic overhead and reduce the total
transmission delay. In the I2V phase, the roadside unit (RSU) encodes the
original large-size file into a number of batches in a rateless manner, each
containing a fixed number of coded packets, and sequentially broadcasts them
during the I2V connection time. In the V2V phase, vehicles perform the network
coded cooperative sharing by re-encoding the received packets. We propose a
utility-based distributed algorithm to efficiently schedule the V2V cooperative
transmissions, hence reducing the transmission delay. A closed-form expression
for the expected rank distribution of the proposed content distribution scheme
is derived, which is used to design the optimal BATS code. The performance of

tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts
because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that
only require short sequences of decisions. In order to realize this potential
of faster learning, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple
levels of policies in parallel so these simpler subproblems can be solved
simultaneously. Yet, learning multiple levels of policies in parallel is hard
because it is inherently unstable: changes in a policy at one level of the
hierarchy may cause changes in the transition and reward functions at higher
levels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels
of policies. In this paper, we introduce a new Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), that can overcome
the instability issues that arise when agents try to jointly learn multiple
levels of policies. The main idea behind HAC is to train each level of the
hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the
lower level policies are already optimal. We demonstrate experimentally in both
grid world and simulated robotics domains that our approach can significantly
accelerate learning relative to other non-hierarchical and hierarchical
methods. Indeed, our framework is the first to successfully learn 3-level
hierarchies in parallel in tasks with continuous state and action spaces.

report a search for such transients (transients that fade by 5-$\sigma$ in

intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). Our search criteria yielded 45
candidates. Of these, two were afterglows to GRBs that had been found in
dedicated follow-up observations to triggers from the Fermi GRB Monitor (GBM).
Another (iPTF14yb; Cenko et al. 2015) was a GRB afterglow discovered
serendipitously. Two were spurious artifacts of reference image subtraction and
one was an asteroid. The remaining 37 candidates have red stellar counterparts
in external catalogs. The photometric and spectroscopic properties of the

already spectroscopically classified as late-type M stars. With iPTF14yb as the

composed of the indices of the selected elements in the corresponding

distance computation is reduced to $O(M)$ from $O(D)$ through a distance table
lookup scheme. The resulting approach is called near-orthogonal composite
quantization. We theoretically justify the equivalence between near-orthogonal
composite quantization and minimizing an upper bound of a function formed by
jointly considering the quantization error and the search cost according to a
generalized triangle inequality. We empirically show the efficacy of the
proposed approach over several benchmark datasets. In addition, we demonstrate
the superior performances in other three applications: combination with

unaffected by the changes in rotation curve, but the production of small and

suggests that while differing rotation curves can influence where clouds are

strong coupling causes the output power of nanowire to behave as an oscillating
form, the oscillating output power in turn causes the field amplitude in the

  eddy simulations of turbulent reacting flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the application of the combustion models based on low-dimensional
manifolds (for instance flamelet models) to large-eddy simulation (LES) of
reactive turbulent flows, the modeling simplifications of the combustion
process is a critical source of uncertainty in addition to those due to the
turbulent closure model and numerical discretization. The ability to
quantitatively assess this uncertainty in absence of the reference result is
vital to the reliable and predictive simulations of practical combustion
devices.In the present study, the Pareto-efficient combustion (PEC) framework
is extended to adaptive LES combustion simulations of turbulent flames. The key
component of the PEC framework is the so-called manifold drift term. Its
extension LES is proposed to make such assessment by examining the compliance
of a particular combustion model in describing a quantity of interest with
respect to the underlying flow field representation. With the focus on
improving predictions of CO emissions of flamelet-based combustion models, this
work employs PEC to augment the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model through
local sub-model assignment of the finite-rate chemistry (FRC) model. To this
end, a series of LES-PEC calculations are performed on a piloted
partially-premixed dimethyl ether flame (DME-D), using a combination of FPV and
FRC models. The drift term is utilized in the PEC framework to the estimate the
model related error for quantities of interest. The PEC approach is
demonstrated to be capable of significantly improving the prediction of CO
emissions compared with the monolithic FPV simulation. The improved accuracy is
achieved by enriching the FPV model with FRC in regions where the lower-order
model is determined insufficient through the evaluation of drift terms.

in contact with a single heat reservoir; however, many recent studies have also
adopted a Langevin description for systems connected to multiple heat
reservoirs. This is accomplished through the introduction of a simple summation
for the dissipation and random-noise terms associated with each reservoir.
However, the validity of this simple addition has been the focus of only
limited discussion and has raised several criticisms. Moreover, this additive
description has never been either experimentally or numerically verified,
rendering its validity is still an open question. Here, we perform molecular
dynamics simulations for a Brownian system in simultaneous contact with
multiple heat reservoirs to check the validity of this additive approach. Our
simulation results confirm that the effect of multiple heat reservoirs is
additive in general.
  A very small deviation in the total amount of dissipation and associated
noise is found, but seems not significant within statistical errors. We find
that the steady-state properties satisfy the additivity perfectly and are not
affected by this deviation.

detection located in Siberia. Previous studies of cosmic rays with Tunka-Rex
have shown high precision in determining the energy of the primary particle and
the possibility to reconstruct the depth of the shower maximum. The next step
is the reconstruction of the mass composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic
rays. One of the main problems appearing within this task is to estimate the
detection efficiency of the instrument, and the exposure of the observations.
The detection efficiency depends on properties of the primary cosmic rays, such
as energy and arrival direction, as well as on many parameters of the
instrument: density of the array, efficiency of the receiving antennas,
signal-detection threshold, data-acquisition acceptance, and trigger
properties. More than that, the configuration of detector changes with time.
During the measurements some parts of the detector can provide corrupted data
or sometimes do not operate. All these features should be taken into account
for an estimation of the detection efficiency. For each energy and arrival
direction we estimate the detection probability and effective area of the
instrument. To estimate the detection probability of a shower we use a simple
Monte Carlo model, which predicts the size of the footprint of the radio
emission as function of the primary energy and arrival direction (taking into
account the geometry of Earth's magnetic field). Combining these approaches we
calculate the event statistics and exposure for each run. This is the first
accurate study of the exposure for irregular large-scale radio arrays taking
into account most important features of detection, which will be used for the
measurement of primary cosmic-ray spectra with Tunka-Rex.

To this end, we apply a quantum kinetic theory beyond the Markov approximation

exciton spin dynamics. If the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the growth
direction of the well, the Markovian spin-transfer rate decreases monotonically
with increasing field as predicted by Fermi's golden rule. The quantum kinetic
theory follows this result qualitatively but predicts pronounced quantitative
differences in the spin-transfer rate as well as in the long-time spin
polarization. However, for an in-plane magnetic field, where the Markovian
spin-transfer rate first drops and then increases again, quantum kinetic
effects become so pronounced that the Markovian trend is completely reversed.
This is made evident by a distinct maximum of the rate followed by a monotonic
decrease. The deviations can be traced back to a redistribution of carriers in
energy space caused by correlations between excitons and magnetic dopants. The
same effect leads to a finite electron-spin polarization at long times in
longitudinal as well as transverse fields which is much larger than the
corresponding Markovian prediction.

a quadratically driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard lattice. Diffusive trajectories

and have a natural tendency to approach coherent states, therefore the method
can be less prone to the bias induced by the fully uncorrelated Gutzwiller
ansatz. Averaging over trajectories does lead to classical correlations and
this allows us to address the correlation length of such 2D lattices of open
quantum systems which is the main goal of this work. Under this approximations,
we find negligible correlation length in the low density phase and apparently
unbounded length grow in the high density phase. Additionally, we show that the
effective relaxation times associated to the times scales for synchronisation
in the high density phase may also diverge suggesting the vanishing of the

identifying entity mentions along with their types and ii) recognizing semantic

We learn three different classifiers : i) local entity classifier, ii) local
relation classifier and iii) ""pipeline"" relation classifier which uses
predictions of the local entity classifier. Predictions of these classifiers
may be inconsistent with each other. We represent these predictions along with
some domain knowledge using weighted first-order logic rules in an MLN and
perform joint inference over the MLN to obtain a global output with minimum
inconsistencies. Experiments on the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) 2004

outperforms the baselines of individual classifiers. Our end-to-end relation
extraction performance is better than 2 out of 3 previous results reported on

kernel density estimation. Among these fast methods, the Fast Sum Updating
approach is an attractive alternative, as it is an exact method and its speed
is independent of the input sample and the bandwidth. Unfortunately, this

univariate case. In this paper, we revisit the fast sum updating approach and
extend it in several ways. Our main contribution is to extend it to the general

contributions include its extension to a wider class of kernels, including the
triangular, cosine and Silverman kernels, its combination with parsimonious
additive multivariate kernels, and its combination with a fast approximate
k-nearest-neighbors bandwidth for multivariate datasets. Our numerical tests of
multivariate regression and density estimation confirm the speed, accuracy and

radiological reports associated to the radiographs. Using a repositotory of
over 700,000 chest radiographs, in this study we demonstrate that promising
nodule detection performance can be achieved using weak labels through
convolutional neural networks for radiograph classification. We propose two
network architectures for the classification of images likely to contain
pulmonary nodules using both weak labels and manually-delineated bounding
boxes, when these are available. Annotated nodules are used at training time to
deliver a visual attention mechanism informing the model about its localisation
performance. The first architecture extracts saliency maps from high-level
convolutional layers and compares the estimated position of a nodule against
the ground truth, when this is available. A corresponding localisation error is
then back-propagated along with the softmax classification error. The second
approach consists of a recurrent attention model that learns to observe a short
sequence of smaller image portions through reinforcement learning. When a
nodule annotation is available at training time, the reward function is
modified accordingly so that exploring portions of the radiographs away from a
nodule incurs a larger penalty. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential
advantages of these architectures in comparison to competing methodologies.

investigated in terms of sequential fission. For the first time, the dynamical
approach based on solving Langevin transport equations in multidimensional
collective coordinate space is used to follow the de-excitation of highly

up to either scission or residue formation, followed by (2) dynamical

reflect the galaxy number density round them, and they can serve as reliable
different density region tracers. Using the data from an unprecedented
large-scale $N$-body simulation ""TianNu"", we conduct some fundamental
statistical studies and clustering analysis of the DT voids. We discuss in
detail the representative features of two-point correlation functions of
different DT void populations. We show that the peak, the position of which
corresponds to the average radius of data samples, is the most representative
feature of the two-point correlation function of the DT voids. In addition, we
also construct another voids, the disjoint voids, and investigate their some

anisotropy of quantum spins, can be strongly renormalized by Kondo exchange
coupling to the conduction electrons in the substrate, as shown recently for

conductance spectra show zero-bias anomalies due to a Kondo effect of the
doubly degenerate ground state, and finite-bias step features due to spin flip
excitations. Here I consider spin-1 quantum magnets with positive uniaxial

does not take place. Nevertheless the renormalization of inelastic spin
excitations due to exchange coupling by hybridization of the quantum spin with

particle-hole symmetry, charge fluctuations have a similar effect to Kondo
exchange coupling, leading to the renormalization of spin flip excitations.
However, in contrast to the renormalization by Kondo exchange, charge
fluctuations lead to asymmetric spectra, which for strong charge fluctuations

reflectivity function (TRF) with the system point spread function (PSF) is a
major issue in medical ultrasound imaging. In this paper, we propose a
correlation constrained missing-data estimation based blind multichannel
frequency- domain least-mean-squares (md-bMCFLMS) algorithm to undo the effect
of PSF on the ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data. In the first step, a
block-based MCFLMS (bMCFLMS) algorithm is proposed to estimate the TRFs and the
PSF which are used in the second step to estimate the missing data. This
missing data is used in the md-bMCFLMS algorithm to construct a modified cost
function for further improvement of the image resolution. To account for the
nonstationarity of the PSF, unlike the blocking approach described in the
literature, we introduce a time-efficient blocking method in this paper. The
blocking approach described here uses a block position independent fixed size
matrix and can be implemented parallely. The bMCFLMS algorithm, however, shows
misconvergence due to both channel noise and propagation of TRF estimation
error from the previous blocks. This phe- nomenon is more intense in the case
of md-bMCFLMS algorithm because of increased estimation error. To address this
problem, a novel constraint based on the correlation between the measured RF
data and estimated TRF is proposed in this paper. The efficacy of our proposed
blind deconvolution algorithm is measured using simulation phantom,
experimental phantom and in-vivo data.

high-redshift galaxies is important in order to understand the star formation
history of the early universe. However, the uncertainties, especially at the
faint and bright ends of the LFs, are still significant.
  Aims. In this paper, we study the UV luminosity function of redshift z = 2.5
- 4.5 galaxies in 2.38 deg^2 of ALHAMBRA data with I <= 24. Thanks to the large
area covered by ALHAMBRA, we particularly constrain the bright end of the
luminosity function. We also calculate the cosmic variance and the
corresponding bias values for our sample and derive their host dark matter halo
masses.
  Methods. We use a novel methodology based on redshift and magnitude
probability distribution functions (PDFs). This methodology robustly takes into
account the uncertainties due to redshift and magnitude errors, shot noise and
cosmic variance, and models the luminosity function in two dimensions (z; M_UV
).
  Results. We find an excess of bright ~ M*_UV galaxies as compared to the
studies based on broad-band photometric data. However, our results agree well
with the luminosity function of the magnitude-selected spectroscopic VVDS data.
We measure high bias values, b ~ 8 - 10, that are compatible with the previous
measurements considering the redshifts and magnitudes of our galaxies and
further reinforce the real high-redshift nature of our bright galaxies.
  Conclusions. We call into question the shape of the luminosity function at
its bright end; is it a double power-law as suggested by the recent broad-band
photometric studies or rather a brighter Schechter function, as suggested by
our multi-filter analysis and the spectroscopic VVDS data.

addressing this problem, we propose an iterative matrix square root

EIG or SVD based ones, since it involves only matrix multiplications, suitable
for parallel implementation on GPU. Moreover, the proposed network with ResNet

training. On large-scale ImageNet, we achieve competitive performance superior

harbouring hot Jupiters and stars with more distant gas-giant planets show any
chemical peculiarity that could be related to different formation processes.
Our results show that stars with hot Jupiters have higher metallicities than
stars with cool distant gas-giant planets in the metallicity range +0.00/+0.20
dex. The data also shows a tendency of stars with cool Jupiters to show larger
abundances of $\alpha$ elements. No abundance differences between stars with
cool and hot Jupiters are found when considering iron peak, volatile elements
or the C/O, and Mg/Si ratios. The corresponding $p$-values from the statistical
tests comparing the cumulative distributions of cool and hot planet hosts are
0.20, $<$ 0.01, 0.81, and 0.16 for metallicity, $\alpha$, iron-peak, and
volatile elements, respectively. We confirm previous works suggesting that more
distant planets show higher planetary masses as well as larger eccentricities.
We note differences in age and spectral type between the hot and cool planet
hosts samples that might affect the abundance comparison. The differences in
the distribution of planetary mass, period, eccentricity, and stellar host
metallicity suggest a different formation mechanism for hot and cool Jupiters.
The slightly larger $\alpha$ abundances found in stars harbouring cool Jupiters
might compensate their lower metallicities allowing the formation of gas-giant
planets.

2017. Three of these planets are in the habitable zone (HZ) of their star,
making them potentially habitable planets a mere 40 light years away. Discovery
of the closest potentially habitable planet to us just a year before --
Proxima~b, and a realization that Earth-type planets in HZ are a common
occurrence provides the impetus to the pursuit for life outside the Solar
System. The search for life has two goals: Earth similarity and habitability.
An index was recently proposed, Cobb-Douglas Habitability Score (CDHS), based
on Cobb-Douglas production function, which computes the habitability score by
using measured and estimated planetary parameters like radius, density, escape
velocity and surface temperature of a planet. The proposed metric with
exponents accounting for metric elasticity, is endowed with analytical
properties that ensure global optima and can be scaled to accommodate a finite
number of input parameters. We show that the model is elastic, and the
conditions on elasticity to ensure global maxima can scale as the number of
predictor parameters increase. K-Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm,
embellished with probabilistic herding and thresholding restriction, utilizes
CDHS scores and labels exoplanets to appropriate classes via feature-learning
methods. The algorithm works on top of a decision-theoretical model using the
power of convex optimization and machine learning. A second approach, based on
a novel feature-learning and tree-building method classifies the same planets
without computing the CDHS of the planets and produces a similar outcome. The
convergence of the two different approaches indicates the strength of the
proposed scheme and the likelihood of the potential habitability of the recent
discoveries.

data structures. For example, subtle problems can arise when hazard pointers,
one of the most common non-automatic techniques, are applied to many lock-free
data structures. Epoch based reclamation (EBR), which is by far the most
efficient non-automatic technique, allows the number of unreclaimed objects to
grow without bound, because one crashed process can prevent all other processes
from reclaiming memory.
  We develop a more efficient, distributed variant of EBR that solves this
problem. It is based on signaling, which is provided by many operating systems,
such as Linux and UNIX. Our new scheme takes $O(1)$ amortized steps per
high-level operation on the data structure and $O(1)$ steps in the worst case
each time an object is removed from the data structure. At any point, $O(mn^2)$
objects are waiting to be freed, where $n$ is the number of processes and $m$
is a small constant for most data structures. Experiments show that our scheme
has very low overhead: on average 10\%, and at worst 28\%, for a balanced
binary search tree over many thread counts, operation mixes and contention
levels. Our scheme also outperforms a highly tuned implementation of hazard
pointers by an average of 75\%.
  Typically, memory reclamation is tightly woven into lock-free data structure
code. To improve modularity and facilitate the comparison of different memory
reclamation schemes, we also introduce a highly flexible abstraction. It allows
a programmer to easily interchange schemes for reclamation, object pooling,
allocation and deallocation with virtually no overhead, by changing a single
line of code.

can observe the chromosphere in the H and K lines of Ca II at high spatial and

formation of these lines are needed to interpret the SST/CHROMIS observations.
Such modeling is computationally challenging because these lines are influenced
by strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium, three-dimensional
radiative transfer, and partially coherent resonance scattering of photons. We
aim to model the CaII H&K lines in 3D model atmospheres to understand their
formation and to investigate their diagnostic potential for probing the
chromosphere. We model the synthetic spectrum of Ca II using the radiative
transfer code Multi3D in three different radiation-magnetohydrodynamic model
atmospheres computed with the Bifrost code. We classify synthetic intensity
profiles according to their shapes and study how their features are related to
the physical properties in the model atmospheres. We investigate whether the
synthetic data reproduce the observed spatially-averaged line shapes,
center-to-limb variation and compare with SST/CHROMIS images. The
spatially-averaged synthetic line profiles show too low central emission peaks,
and too small separation between the peaks. The trends of the observed
center-to-limb variation of the profiles properties are reproduced by the
models. The Ca II H&K line profiles provide a temperature diagnostic of the
temperature minimum and the temperature at the formation height of the emission
peaks. The Doppler shift of the central depression is an excellent probe of the
velocity in the upper chromosphere.

Even if matter is neutral of electric charge, it is charged for this weak

call the weak flavor charge of aggregated matter. For each one of the
interacting aggregates, this charge depends on the neutrino flavor as
$Q_W^{\nu_e} = 2Z-N$, $Q_W^{\nu_\mu} = Q_W^{\nu_\tau} = -N$, where $Z$ is the

explicitly on $Z$ because of the charged current contribution to $\nu_e e$
elastic scattering, while the $N$ term in the three charges comes from the
universal neutral current contribution. The effective potential describing this

emerging for CDW order in the electron-doped cuprates, the CDW would be thought
to be a universal phenomenon in high-$T_c$ cuprates. However, the CDW phenomena

shows the same reflections at the wavevector (~1/4, 0, $l$) as like the
reported superconducting NCCO. This superconductivity-insensitive signal is
quite different with the characteristics of the CDW reflection in hole-doped
cuprates. Moreover, the ARPES result suggests that the fermiology cannot
account for such wavevector. These results call into question the universality

patterns in streams of continuously arriving data. This field has been
traditionally approached from a practical point of view, resulting in
heterogeneous implementations with fundamentally different capabilities. The
main reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is
not trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and
filtering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure.
Moreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex
events, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended.
  In this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event
recognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce
a CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that
uses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events.
This makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to
develop the first steps in understanding its expressive power. We start by
comparing SO-CEL with a version that uses first-order variables called FO-CEL,
showing that they are equivalent in expressive power when restricted to unary
predicates but, surprisingly, incomparable in general. Nevertheless, we show
that if we restrict to sets of binary predicates, then SO-CEL is strictly more
expressive than FO-CEL. Then, we introduce a natural computational model called
Unary Complex Event Automata (UCEA) that provides a better understanding of
SO-CEL. We show that, under unary predicates, SO-CEL captures the subclass of
UCEA that satisfy the so-called *-property. Finally, we identify the operations
that SO-CEL is lacking to capture UCEA and introduce a natural extension of the

spaces with mixed norms. We study properties of the mixed weak norm and the
iterated weak norm and present the relationship between the two weak norms.
Even for the ordinary Lebesgue spaces, the two weak norms are not equivalent
and any one of them can not control the other one. We give some convergence and
completeness results for both weak norms. We study the convergence in truncated
norm, which is a substitution of the convergence in measure for mixed Lebesgue
spaces. And we give a characterization of the convergence in truncated norm. We
show that H\""older's inequality is not always true on mixed weak spaces and we
give a complete characterization of indices which admit H\""older's inequality.
As applications, we establish some geometric inequalities related to fractional
integration in mixed weak spaces and in iterated weak spaces which essentially
generalize the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.

for the mean additional light due to chance superposition of Cepheids on
crowded backgrounds through the use of artificial star measurements. However,
light from stars physically associated with Cepheids may bias relative distance
measurements if the changing spatial resolution along the distance ladder
significantly alters the amount of associated blending. We have identified two
regimes where this phenomenon may occur: Cepheids in wide binaries and open
clusters.
  We estimate stellar association bias using the photometric passbands and
reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes used to set up the distance scale. For wide
binaries, we rely on Geneva stellar evolution models in conjunction with
detailed statistics on intermediate-mass binary stars. For the impact of
cluster stars, we have compiled information on the clustered Cepheid fraction
and measured the typical cluster contribution in M31 via deep HST imaging
provided by the PHAT project.
  We find that the dominant effect on the distance scale comes from Cepheids in
clusters, despite cluster Cepheids being a relatively rare phenomenon. Wide
binaries have a negligible effect of 0.004% on $H_0$ for long-period Cepheids
observed in the near-infrared or when considering Wesenheit magnitudes. We
estimate that blending due to cluster populations has previously resulted in a
0.23% overestimate of $H_0$. Correcting for this bias, we obtain $H_0 = 73.07
\pm 1.76 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, which remains in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the
Planck value. We conclude that stellar association bias does not constitute a
limit for measuring $H_0$ with an accuracy of 1%.

first is via time scaling of spread of correlations in the isolated system in
thermodynamic limit. The second is via system size scaling of conductance in
the steady state of the open system. We show here that these correspond to
taking the thermodynamic limit and the long time limit of the integrated
equilibrium current-current correlations of the open system in different order.
In general, the limits may not commute leading to a conflict between the two
standard ways of transport classification. Nevertheless, the full information
is contained in the equilibrium current-current correlations of the open
system. We show this analytically by rigorously deriving the open-system
current fluctuation dissipation relations (OCFDR) starting from an extremely
general open quantum set-up and then carefully taking the proper limits. We
test our theory numerically on the non-trivial example of the critical
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, where, it has been recently shown that, the
two standard classifications indeed give different results. We find that both
the total current autocorrelation and the long-range local current correlations

a time scale. This time scale grows as square of system size. Beyond this time
scale a steady state value is reached. The steady state value is conductance,

transparently how the conditional evolution of the open system depends on the

be optimized for steering. The nonlocal measurement scenario leads to maximal

distributed according to a Bayesian posterior given the data, rather than the
maximum likelihood estimator. Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) is
one algorithm to approximate such Bayesian posteriors for large models and
datasets. SGLD is a standard stochastic gradient descent to which is added a
controlled amount of noise, specifically scaled so that the parameter converges
in law to the posterior distribution [WT11, TTV16]. The posterior predictive
distribution can be approximated by an ensemble of samples from the trajectory.
  Choice of the variance of the noise is known to impact the practical behavior
of SGLD: for instance, noise should be smaller for sensitive parameter
directions. Theoretically, it has been suggested to use the inverse Fisher
information matrix of the model as the variance of the noise, since it is also
the variance of the Bayesian posterior [PT13, AKW12, GC11]. But the Fisher
matrix is costly to compute for large- dimensional models.
  Here we use the easily computed Fisher matrix approximations for deep neural
networks from [MO16, Oll15]. The resulting natural Langevin dynamics combines
the advantages of Amari's natural gradient descent and Fisher-preconditioned
Langevin dynamics for large neural networks.
  Small-scale experiments on MNIST show that Fisher matrix preconditioning
brings SGLD close to dropout as a regularizing technique.

several episodes of ejecta separated by a long quiescent interval. In this

launched ejecta into the circum-burst medium and the later launched ejecta may
interact with the external shock at later period. Owing to the internal
dissipation, the later launched ejecta may be observed at a later time
($t_{\rm{jet}}$). In this paper, we study the relation of $t_{\rm{b}}$ and
$t_{\rm{jet}}$, where $t_{\rm{b}}$ is the collision time of the later launched
ejecta with the formed external shock. It is found that the relation of
$t_{\rm{b}}$ and $t_{\rm{jet}}$ depends on the bulk Lorentz factor
($\Gamma_{\rm{jet}}$) of the later launched ejecta and the density ($\rho$) of
the circum-burst medium. If the value of $\Gamma_{\rm{jet}}$ or $\rho$ is low,
the $t_{\rm{b}}$ would be significantly larger than $t_{\rm{jet}}$. However,
the $t_{\rm{b}}\sim t_{\rm{jet}}$ can be found if the value of
$\Gamma_{\rm{jet}}$ or $\rho$ is significantly large. Our results can explain
the large lag of the optical emission relative to the $\gamma$-ray/X-ray
emission in GRBs, e.g., GRB~111209A. For GRBs with a precursor, our results
suggest that the energy injection into the external shock and thus more than

the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at $X$- and $L$- band and with the European

radio emission at $X$-band spatially coincident with the equal-mass M7.5 binary

optically-thin, synchrotron or gyrosynchrotron radiation is responsible for the
observed radio emission. Interestingly, no signal is seen at $L$-band where we

transportation and plug-in electric bus fast charging stations (PEBFCSs) play
an essential role in the operation of PEBs. Under effective control, deploying
an energy storage system (ESS) within a PEBFCS can reduce the peak charging
loads and the electricity purchase costs. To deal with the (integrated)
scheduling problem of (PEBs charging and) ESS charging and discharging, in this
study, we propose an optimal real-time coordinated charging and discharging
strategy for a PEBFCS with ESS to achieve maximum economic benefits. According
to whether the PEB charging loads are controllable, the corresponding
mathematical models are respectively established under two scenarios, i.e.,
coordinated PEB charging scenario and uncoordinated PEB charging scenario. The
price and lifespan of ESS, the capacity charge of PEBFCS and the electricity
price arbitrage are considered in the models. Further, under the coordinated
PEB charging scenario, a heuristics-based method is developed to get the
approximately optimal strategy with computation efficiency dramatically
enhanced. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies,
interpret the effect of ESS prices on the usage of ESS, and provide the
sensitivity analysis of ESS capacity through the case studies.

variables are complexified and the integration manifold is determined by the
flow equations or stochastically sampled. When we have singular points of the

we have a risk to encounter the residual and global sign problems or the
singular drift term problem. One of the ways to avoid the singular points is to
optimize the integration path which is designed not to hit the singular points
of the Boltzmann weight. By specifying the one-dimensional integration-path as
$z=t+if(t) (f\in \mathbb{R})$ and by optimizing $f(t)$ to enhance the average
phase factor, we demonstrate that we can avoid the sign problem in a
one-variable toy model for which the complex Langevin method is found to fail.

challenging since previous literature fails to capture motion and shape cues

jointly encodes both motion and shape cues. First, background clutter is
removed by a background modeling method that is designed for depth data. Then,
motion and shape cues are jointly used to generate robust and distinctive
spatial-temporal interest points (STIPs): motion-based STIPs and shape-based
STIPs. In the first layer of our model, a multi-scale 3D local steering kernel
(M3DLSK) descriptor is proposed to describe local appearances of cuboids around
motion-based STIPs. In the second layer, a spatial-temporal vector (STV)

shape-based STIPs. Using the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, motion and shape
cues are combined to form a fused action representation. Our model performs
favorably compared with common STIP detection and description methods. Thorough
experiments verify that our model is effective in distinguishing similar

The geometrical properties of the near-Sun flux rope is obtained by

properties and the reconnection flux we extract the magnetic properties of the

at 1 AU. We use a constant-{\alpha} force-free cylindrical flux rope model fit
to the in situ observations in order to derive the magnetic and geometric
information of the 1-AU ICME. We find a good correspondence in both amplitude

find that the line node radius is rather sensitive to bulk volume change. Based
on this observation, we propose that application of pressure or suitable
substrate engineering can be used as an effective means to control and tune the
line node and the accompanying surface drumhead states.

  BaTiO$_3$","9 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1063/1.5018746",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A method for evaluating the piezoelectric response of unpoled ferroelectric
ceramics from elastic and dielectric measurements is proposed and tested on
BaTiO$_3$. The method is based on the observation that the softening in a
ferroelectric phase with respect to the paraelectric phase is of piezoelectric
origin. The angular averages of the piezoelectric softening in unpoled ceramics
are calculated for ferroelectric phases of different symmetries. The expression
of the orientational average with the piezoelectric and dielectric constants of
single crystal tetragonal BaTiO$_3$ from the literature reproduces well the
softening of the Young's modulus of unpoled ceramic BaTiO$_3$, after a
correction for the porosity. The agreement is good in the temperature region
sufficiently far from the Curie temperature and from the transition to the
orthorhombic phase, where the effect of fluctuations should be negligible, but
deviations are found outside this region, and the reason for this is discussed.
This validates the determination of the piezoelectric response by means of
purely elastic measurements on unpoled samples. The method is indirect and, for
quantitative assessments, requires the knowledge of the dielectric tensor. On
the other hand, it does not require poling of the sample, and therefore is
insensitive to inaccuracies from incomplete poling, and can even be used with
materials that cannot be poled, for example due to excessive electrical
conductivity. While the proposed example of the Young's modulus of a ceramic
provides an orientational average of all the single crystal piezoelectric
constants, a Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy measurement of a single unpoled
ceramic sample through the ferroelectric transition can in principle measure
all the piezoelectric constants, together with the elastic ones.

different effective models governing each level. We conjecture that agent
classes may in fact operate at different time scales and thus act differently

state trajectories and action sequences estimated from aggregate market
behaviour, we use Inverse Reinforcement Learning to compute the effective
reward function for the aggregate agent class at each scale, allowing us to
assess the relative attractiveness of feature vectors across different scales.
Differences in reward functions for feature vectors may indicate different
objectives of market participants, which could assist in finding the scale
boundary for agent classes. This has implications for learning algorithms

with local views solve some computational task by exchanging messages with
their neighbors. Quite unfortunately, an inherent property of most existing
distributed algorithms is that throughout the course of their execution, the
nodes get to learn not only their own output but rather learn quite a lot on
the inputs or outputs of many other entities. This leakage of information might
be a major obstacle in settings where the output (or input) of network's
individual is a private information. In this paper, we introduce a new
framework for \emph{secure distributed graph algorithms} and provide the first
\emph{general compiler} that takes any ""natural"" non-secure distributed
algorithm that runs in $r$ rounds, and turns it into a secure algorithm that
runs in $\widetilde{O}(r \cdot D \cdot poly(\Delta))$ rounds where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree in the graph and $D$ is its diameter. The security of the
compiled algorithm is information-theoretic but holds only against a
semi-honest adversary that controls a single node in the network.
  This compiler is made possible due to a new combinatorial structure called
\emph{private neighborhood trees}: a collection of $n$ trees
$T(u_1),\ldots,T(u_n)$, one for each vertex $u_i \in V(G)$, such that each tree
$T(u_i)$ spans the neighbors of $u_i$ {\em without going through $u_i$}.
Intuitively, each tree $T(u_i)$ allows all neighbors of $u_i$ to exchange a
\emph{secret} that is hidden from $u_i$, which is the basic graph
infrastructure of the compiler. In a $(d,c)$-private neighborhood trees each
tree $T(u_i)$ has depth at most $d$ and each edge $e \in G$ appears in at most
$c$ different trees. We show a construction of private neighborhood trees with
$d=\widetilde{O}(\Delta \cdot D)$ and $c=\widetilde{O}(D)$.

Simulation of GWs in a manifestly quantum system would allow for the study of

exploited in a recently proposed Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) based GW
detector. In this paper, we show how to manipulate a BEC to mimic the effect of
a passing GW. By simultaneously varying the external potential applied to the
BEC, and an external magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance, we show that the
resulting change in speed of sound can directly reproduce a GW metric. We also
show how to simulate a metric used in the recently proposed BEC based GW
detector, to provide an environment for testing the proposed metrology scheme
of the detector. Explicit expressions for simulations of various GW sources are
given. This result is also useful to generally test the interaction of quantum

genotype and phenotype. The usual approach consists of statistical inference of
variants from alignments of sequencing reads. State-of-the-art variant callers
can resolve a wide range of different variant types with high accuracy.
However, they require that all read alignments be available from the beginning
of variant calling and be sorted by coordinates. Sorting is computationally
expensive, both memory- and speed-wise, and the resulting pipelines suffer from
storing and retrieving large alignments files from external memory. Therefore,
there is interest in developing methods for resource-efficient variant calling.
  Results: We present Ococo, the first program capable of inferring variants in
a real-time, as read alignments are fed in. Ococo inputs unsorted alignments
from a stream and infers single-nucleotide variants, together with a genomic
consensus, using statistics stored in compact several-bit counters. Ococo
provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to the usual variant calling.
It is particularly advantageous when reads are sequenced or mapped
progressively, or when available computational resources are at a premium.

(AGN), and a unified model for AGN was inferred mostly from indirect methods.
Optical reverberation mapping allowed us to constrain the spatial dimension of
the broad emission line region and thereby to measure the mass of supermassive
black holes. Recently, reverberation was also applied to the polarized signal
emerging from different AGN components. In principle, this should allow us to
measure the spatial dimensions of the sub-parsec reprocessing media. We modeled
scattering-induced polarization and tested different geometries for the
circumnuclear dust component. Our tests included the effects of clumpiness and
different dust prescriptions. To further extend the model, we also explored the
effects of additional ionized winds stretched along the polar direction, and of
an equatorial scattering ring that is responsible for the polarization angle
observed in pole-on AGN. The simulations were run using a time-dependent
version of the {\sc stokes} code. Our modeling confirms the previously found
polarization characteristics as a function of the observer`s viewing angle.
When the dust adopts a flared-disk geometry, the lags reveal a clear difference
between type 1 and type 2 AGN. This distinction is less clear for a torus
geometry where the time lag is more sensitive to the geometry and optical depth
of the inner surface layers of the funnel. The presence of a scattering
equatorial ring and ionized outflows increased the recorded polarization time
lags, and the polar outflows smooths out dependence on viewing angle. Together
with other AGN observables, the polarization time lag places new, independent
constraints on the inner geometry of AGN. If we conduct time-dependent
spectropolarimetric observing campaigns of AGN, this method has a high
potential for a census of supermassive black holes.

to 2.5 keV from the downwind hemisphere of the heliosphere. These ENAs are
believed to originate mostly from pickup protons and solar wind protons in the
inner heliosheath. This study includes all low-energy observations made with
the Interstellar Boundary Explorer over the first 8 years. Since the protons
around 0.1 keV dominate the plasma pressure in the inner heliosheath in
downwind direction, these ENA observations offer the unique opportunity to
constrain the plasma properties and dimensions of the heliosheath where no
in-situ observations are available.
  We first derive energy spectra of ENA intensities averaged over time for 49
macropixels covering the entire downwind hemisphere. The results confirm
previous studies regarding integral intensities and the roll-over around 0.1
keV energy. With the expanded dataset we now find that ENA intensities at 0.2
and 0.1 keV seem to anti-correlate with solar activity. We then derive the
product of total plasma pressure and emission thickness of protons in the
heliosheath to estimate lower limits on the thickness of the inner heliosheath.
The temporally averaged ENA intensities support a rather spherical shape of the
termination shock and a heliosheath thickness between 150 and 210 au for most
regions of the downwind hemisphere. Around the nominal downwind direction of
76{\deg} ecliptic longitude, the heliosheath is at least 280 au thick. There,
the neutral hydrogen density seems to be depleted compared to upwind directions
by roughly a factor of 2.

capabilities of the proposed control. The first part incorporates matching of
states of the followers with those of the leader via consensus tracking
algorithm. In the subsequent part, an event triggered rule is devised to save
computational power and restrict periodic updating of the controller involved
while ensuring desired closed loop performance of the system. Switching of the

possibility, either by deposition on dust grains or thanks to a phase
transition combined with self-gravity. H 2 condensation might explain the
observed low efficiency of star formation and might help to hide baryons in
spiral galaxies.
  Our aim is to quantify the solid fraction of H 2 in the ISM due to a phase
transition including self-gravity for different densities and temperatures in
order to use the results in more complex simulations of the ISM as subgrid
physics.
  We used molecular dynamics simulations of fluids at different temperatures
and densities to study the formation of solids. Once the simulations reached a
steady state, we calculated the solid mass fraction, energy increase, and
timescales. By determining the power laws measured over several orders of
magnitude, we extrapolated to lower densities the higher density fluids that
can be simulated with current computers.
  The solid fraction and energy increase of fluids in a phase transition are
above 0.1 and do not follow a power law. Fluids out of a phase transition are
still forming a small amount of solids due to chance encounters of molecules.
The solid mass fraction and energy increase of these fluids are linearly
dependent on density and can easily be extrapolated. The timescale is below one
second, the condensation can be considered instantaneous.
  The presence of solid H 2 grains has important dynamic implications on the
ISM as they may be the building blocks for larger solid bodies when gravity is
included. We provide the solid mass fraction, energy increase, and timescales
for high density fluids and extrapolation laws for lower densities.

process of modern, rich internet applications. Technologies for the different
tiers of the application have to be selected: a server-side language, a
combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the client, and a database
technology. Meeting the expectations of contemporary web applications requires
even more effort from the developer: many state of the art libraries must be
mastered and glued together. This leads to an impedance mismatch problem
between the different technologies and it is up to the programmer to align them
manually. Multi-tier or tierless programming is a web programming paradigm that
provides one language for the different tiers of the web application, allowing
the programmer to focus on the actual program logic instead of the accidental
complexity that comes from combining several technologies. While current
tierless approaches therefore relieve the burden of having to combine different
technologies into one application, the distribution of the code is explicitly
tied into the program. Certain distribution decisions have an impact on
crosscutting concerns such as information security or offline availability.
Moreover, adapting the programs such that the application complies better with
these concerns often leads to code tangling, rendering the program more
difficult to understand and maintain. We introduce an approach to multi-tier
programming where the tierless code is decoupled from the tier specification.
The developer implements the web application in terms of slices and an external
specification that assigns the slices to tiers. A recommender system completes
the picture for those slices that do not have a fixed placement and proposes
slice refinements as well. This recommender system tries to optimise the tier
specification with respect to one or more crosscutting concerns. This is in
contrast with current cutting edge solutions that hide distribution decisions
from the programmer. In this paper we show that slices, together with a
recommender system, enable the developer to experiment with different
placements of slices, until the distribution of the code satisfies the
programmer's needs. We present a search-based recommender system that maximises
the offline availability of a web application and a concrete implementation of
these concepts in the tier-splitting tool Stip.js.

  Issue 2, Article 4","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2018/2/4",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: In C, low-level errors, such as buffer overflow and use-after-free,
are a major problem, as they cause security vulnerabilities and hard-to-find
bugs. C lacks automatic checks, and programmers cannot apply defensive
programming techniques because objects (e.g., arrays or structs) lack run-time
information about bounds, lifetime, and types. Inquiry: Current approaches to
tackling low-level errors include dynamic tools, such as bounds or type
checkers, that check for certain actions during program execution. If they
detect an error, they typically abort execution. Although they track run-time
information as part of their runtimes, they do not expose this information to
programmers. Approach: We devised an introspection interface that allows C
programmers to access run-time information and to query object bounds, object
lifetimes, object types, and information about variadic arguments. This enables
library writers to check for invalid input or program states and thus, for
example, to implement custom error handling that maintains system availability
and does not terminate on benign errors. As we assume that introspection is
used together with a dynamic tool that implements automatic checks, errors that
are not handled in the application logic continue to cause the dynamic tool to
abort execution. Knowledge: Using the introspection interface, we implemented a
more robust, source-compatible version of the C standard library that validates
parameters to its functions. The library functions react to otherwise undefined
behavior; for example, they can detect lurking flaws, handle unterminated
strings, check format string arguments, and set errno when they detect benign
usage errors. Grounding: Existing dynamic tools maintain run-time information
that can be used to implement the introspection interface, and we demonstrate
its implementation in Safe Sulong, an interpreter and dynamic bug-finding tool
for C that runs on a Java Virtual Machine and can thus easily expose relevant
run-time information. Importance: Using introspection in user code is a novel
approach to tackling the long-standing problem of low-level errors in C. As new
approaches are lowering the performance overhead of run-time information
maintenance, the usage of dynamic runtimes for C could become more common,
which could ultimately facilitate a more widespread implementation of such an
introspection interface.

these timelike curves are linearly stable under linear perturbations.
Additionally, the spacetime admits null geodesics curve which are not closed,
and the metric is of type D in the Petrov classification scheme. The
stress-energy tensor anisotropic fluid satisfy the different energy conditions

exploited to verify the physiological reliability of such a relationship in
terms of signal transmission delay from the centre to the periphery. Our
preliminary results suggest - in line with recent literature - that activity in
the high beta band (around 30 Hz) could represent an electroencephalographic
correlate for the pathological electromyographic bursts affecting the focal

needed to statistically support these preliminary findings, this contribution
allows to think of new kinds of rehabilitation from focal hand dystonia that

boundary condition (the Past Hypothesis) to account for the temporal asymmetry.
In this paper, I show that the Past Hypothesis also contains enough information
to simplify the quantum ontology and define a natural initial condition. First,
I introduce Density Matrix Realism, the thesis that the quantum state of the
universe is objective and impure. This stands in sharp contrast to Wave
Function Realism, the thesis that the quantum state of the universe is
objective and pure. Second, I suggest that the Past Hypothesis is sufficient to
determine a natural density matrix, which is simple and unique. This is
achieved by what I call the Initial Projection Hypothesis: the initial density
matrix of the universe is the (normalized) projection onto the Past Hypothesis
subspace (in the Hilbert space). Third, because the initial quantum state is
unique and simple, we have a strong case for the Nomological Thesis: the
initial quantum state of the universe is on a par with laws of nature. This new
package of ideas has several interesting implications, including on the harmony
between statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, theoretical unity of the

realized by a series of local environments using coherent methods. First of
all, we show that at reduced states, these cliques have the same acceleration
effects as their roles in accelerating classical gossip algorithms, which can
even make possible finite-time convergence for suitable network structures.
Next, for randomized selection of cliques where node updates enjoy a more
self-organized and scalable sequencing, we show that the rate of convergence is
precisely improved by $\mathcal{O}(k/n)$ at the reduced states, where $k$ is
the size of the cliques and $n$ is the number of qubits in the network. The
rate of convergence at the coherent states of the overall quantum network is
proven to be decided by the spectrum of a mean-square error evolution matrix.
Explicit calculation of such matrix is rather challenging, nonetheless, the
effect of cliques on the coherent states' dynamics is illustrated via numerical
examples. Interestingly, the use of larger quantum cliques does not necessarily
increase the speed of the network density aggregation, suggesting quantum
network dynamics is not entirely decided by its classical topology.

binaries contribute to the periastron advance of the orbit. This extra term
involves the moment of inertia of the neutron stars. Moment of inertia, on the
other hand, depends on the mass and spin of the neutron star as well as the
equation of state of the matter. If at least one member of the double neutron
star binary (better the faster one) is a radio pulsar, then accurate timing
analysis might lead to the estimation of the contribution of the Lense-Thirring
effect to the periastron advance, which will lead to the measurement of the
moment of inertia of the pulsar. Combination of the knowledge on the values of
the moment of inertia, the mass, and the spin of the pulsar, will give a new
constraint on the equation of state. Pulsars in double neutron star binaries
are the best for this purpose as short orbits and moderately high
eccentricities make the Lense-Thirring effect substantial, whereas tidal
effects are negligible (unlike pulsars with main sequence or white-dwarf
binaries). The most promising pulsars are PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854.
The spin-precession of pulsars due to the misalignment between the spin and the
orbital angular momentum vectors affect the contribution of the Lense-Thirring
effect to the periastron advance. This effect has been explored for both PSR
J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854, and as the misalignment angles for both of
these pulsars are small, the variation in the Lense-Thirring term is not much.
However, to extract the Lense-Thirring effect from the observed rate of the

numerical discretisation techniques. This new framework aims to extend the
conventional Delaunay-Voronoi primal-dual structure; seeking to assemble
generalised orthogonal tessellations with enhanced geometric quality. The
construction of these grids is motivated by the desire to improve the
performance and accuracy of numerical methods based on unstructured co-volume

fluid dynamics and hyperbolic transport. In this study, a new hybrid
optimisation strategy is proposed; seeking to optimise the geometry, topology
and weights associated with general, two-dimensional Regular-Power
tessellations using a combination of gradient-ascent and energy-based
techniques. The performance of this new method is tested experimentally, with a
range of complex, multi-resolution primal-dual grids generated for various
coastal and regional ocean modelling applications.

  Text Classification",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a Label Propagation based algorithm for weakly supervised text
classification. We construct a graph where each document is represented by a
node and edge weights represent similarities among the documents. Additionally,
we discover underlying topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and
enrich the document graph by including the topics in the form of additional
nodes. The edge weights between a topic and a text document represent level of
""affinity"" between them. Our approach does not require document level
labelling, instead it expects manual labels only for topic nodes. This
significantly minimizes the level of supervision needed as only a few topics
are observed to be enough for achieving sufficiently high accuracy. The Label
Propagation Algorithm is employed on this enriched graph to propagate labels
among the nodes. Our approach combines the advantages of Label Propagation
(through document-document similarities) and Topic Modelling (for minimal but
smart supervision). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various
datasets and compare with state-of-the-art weakly supervised text
classification approaches.

optically thin black hole accretion flows incorporating toroidal component of
magnetic field. Following global and local MHD simulations of black hole
accretion disks, the magnetic field inside the disk is decomposed into a large
scale field and a fluctuating field. The effects of the fluctuating magnetic
field in transferring the angular momentum and dissipating the energy are
described through the usual $ \alpha $ description. We solved the MHD equations
by assuming steady state and radially self-similar approximation in $ r-\theta
$ plane of spherical coordinate system. We found that as the amount of magnetic
field at the equatorial plane increases, the heating by the viscosity
decreases. In addition, the maximum amount of the heating by the viscous
dissipation is produced at the mid-plane of the disk, while that of the heating
by the magnetic field dissipation is produced at the surface of the disk. Our
main conclusion is that in terms of the no-outflow solution, thermal
equilibrium still exists for the strong magnetic filed at the equatorial plane
of the disk.

within which the digital computer (one of many possible) exercises a role
reminiscent of theology. Since it is closed to meaning, algorithmic digital
computation can at most mimic the creative aspects of life. AI, in the
perspective of time, proved to be less an acronym for artificial intelligence
and more of automating tasks associated with intelligence. The entire
development led to the hypostatized role of the machine: outputting nothing
else but reality, including that of the humanity that made the machine happen.
The convergence machine called deep learning is only the latest form through
which the deterministic theology of the machine claims more than what extremely
effective data processing actually is. A new understanding of complexity, as
well as the need to distinguish between the reactive nature of the artificial

to the challenges posed by machine theology.

form of cancer in women. It is the second leading cause of death among women
round the world, becoming the most fatal form of cancer. Mammographic image
segmentation is a fundamental task to support image analysis and diagnosis,
taking into account shape analysis of mammary lesions and their borders.
However, mammogram segmentation is a very hard process, once it is highly
dependent on the types of mammary tissues. In this work we present a new
semi-supervised segmentation algorithm based on the modification of the GrowCut
algorithm to perform automatic mammographic image segmentation once a region of
interest is selected by a specialist. In our proposal, we used fuzzy Gaussian
membership functions to modify the evolution rule of the original GrowCut
algorithm, in order to estimate the uncertainty of a pixel being object or
background. The main impact of the proposed method is the significant reduction
of expert effort in the initialization of seed points of GrowCut to perform
accurate segmentation, once it removes the need of selection of background
seeds. We also constructed an automatic point selection process based on the
simulated annealing optimization method, avoiding the need of human
intervention. The proposed approach was qualitatively compared with other
state-of-the-art segmentation techniques, considering the shape of segmented
regions. In order to validate our proposal, we built an image classifier using
a classical multilayer perceptron. We used Zernike moments to extract segmented
image features. This analysis employed 685 mammograms from IRMA breast cancer
database, using fat and fibroid tissues. Results show that the proposed
technique could achieve a classification rate of 91.28\% for fat tissues,
evidencing the feasibility of our approach.

computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation learning has

into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure,
vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original
network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In
this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on
network representation learning in the data mining and machine learning field.
We propose new taxonomies to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-art

mechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as the
algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols used
for validating network representation learning including published benchmark
