a problem of importance for modelling stellar spectra and obtaining accurate
oxygen abundances in late-type stars including the Sun. The collisions have
been studied theoretically using a previously presented method based on an
asymptotic two-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) model of
ionic-covalent interactions in the neutral atom-hydrogen-atom system, together
with the multichannel Landau-Zener model. The method has been extended to
include configurations involving excited states of hydrogen using an estimate
for the two-electron transition coupling, but this extension was found to not
lead to any remarkably high rates. Rate coefficients are calculated for
temperatures in the range 1000 - 20000 K, and charge transfer and
(de)excitation processes involving the first excited S-states, 4s.5So and
4s.3So, are found to have the highest rates.

algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. As an intermediate step
we also classify automorphism groups of quartic del Pezzo surfaces. We show
that the moduli space of smooth cubic surfaces is rational in every
characteristic, determine the dimensions of the strata admitting each possible
isomorphism class of automorphism group, and find explicit normal forms in each

positive characteristic, together with a group action, can be lifted to
characteristic zero.

transitions in the early universe. They are also predicted to form in the
context of string theory. The main mechanism for a network of Nambu-Goto cosmic
strings to lose energy is through the production of loops and the subsequent
emission of gravitational waves, thus offering an experimental signature for
the existence of cosmic strings. Here we report on the analysis conducted to
specifically search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string loops in
the data of Advanced LIGO 2015-2016 observing run (O1). No evidence of such
signals was found in the data, and as a result we set upper limits on the
cosmic string parameters for three recent loop distribution models. In this
paper, we initially derive constraints on the string tension $G\mu$ and the
intercommutation probability, using not only the burst analysis performed on
the O1 data set, but also results from the previously published LIGO stochastic
O1 analysis, pulsar timing arrays, cosmic microwave background and Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis experiments. We show that these data sets are complementary in
that they probe gravitational waves produced by cosmic string loops during very
different epochs. Finally, we show that the data sets exclude large parts of
the parameter space of the three loop distribution models we consider.

or comparably complex environments are faced with the challenge of online model
selection. In principle this challenge can be overcome: hierarchical Bayesian
inference provides a principled method for model selection and it converges on
the same posterior for both off-line (i.e. batch) and online learning. However,
maintaining a parameter posterior for each model in parallel has in general an
even higher memory cost than storing the entire data set and is consequently
clearly unfeasible. Alternatively, maintaining only a limited set of models in
memory could limit memory requirements. However, sufficient statistics for one
model will usually be insufficient for fitting a different kind of model,
meaning that the agent loses information with each model change. We propose
that episodic memory can circumvent the challenge of limited memory-capacity
online model selection by retaining a selected subset of data points. We design
a method to compute the quantities necessary for model selection even when the
data is discarded and only statistics of one (or few) learnt models are
available. We demonstrate on a simple model that a limited-sized episodic
memory buffer, when the content is optimised to retain data with statistics not
matching the current representation, can resolve the fundamental challenge of
online model selection.

commonly-used approximation due to Starkman, Gould, Esmailzadeh and Dimopoulos
(SGED) can fail badly in computing the attenuation, even while being useful for
an order-of-magnitude estimate of the maximum cross section reach. We introduce
a method of importance sampling which makes Monte-Carlo simulation of energy
loss feasible, in spite of factor-$10^7$ or greater attenuation. We demonstrate
the validity of our new method and expose multiple problems with the SGED
approximation, this reveals interesting features of the energy loss process. We
spot-check the recent Emken, Kouvaris and Shoemaker ""$5\,\Delta v$""
prescription to place limits on cross sections based on a limited-statistics
analysis, and find that an accurate simulation yields a factor of
$\rm{4.4\times10^6}$ and $\rm{2.4\times10^4}$ larger number of events, for 50
MeV and 1 GeV DM mass respectively, than if the EKS $5\,\Delta v$ prescription
were valid.

question arises as to which Scrum role (Product Owner, Scrum Master, or Scrum
Team Member) corresponds to a Project Manager, or conversely which Scrum role
should the Project Managers adopt? In an attempt to answer this question, we
adopted a mixed-method research approach comprising a systematic literature
review and embedded case study of a commercial software development team. Our
research has identified activities that comprise the Scrum Master role, and
which additional roles are actually performed by Scrum Masters in practice. We
found nine activities that are performed by Scrum Masters. In addition, we
found that Scrum Masters also perform other roles, most importantly as Project
Managers. This latter situation results in tension and conflict of interest
that could have a negative impact on the performance of the team as a whole.
These results point to the need to re-assess the role of Project Managers in
organizations that adopt Scrum as a development approach. We hypothesize that
it might be better for Project Managers to become Product Owners, as aspects of
this latter role are more consistent with the traditional responsibilities of a
Project Manager.

is employed, which leads to an unbiased formulation and, when applied to the
mortar setting, has the additional advantage that the mortar coupling term is
no longer present in the contact forces. As a result, the computationally
expensive segmentation at overlapping master-slave element boundaries, usually
required in mortar methods (although often simplified with loss of accuracy),
is not needed from the outset. For the numerical integration of general contact
problems, the so-called refined boundary quadrature is employed, which is based
on adaptive partitioning of contact elements along the contact boundary. The
contact patch test shows that the proposed formulation passes the test without
using either segmentation or refined boundary quadrature. Several numerical
examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the

manipulate electronic states of quantum materials, and leads to rich spectra of
phase diagrams in cuprate and iron-based superconductors. Here we report a
novel and generic strategy to achieve nonvolatile electron doping in series of
(i.e. 11 and 122 structures) Fe-based superconductors by ionic liquid gating
induced protonation at room temperature. Accumulation of protons in bulk
compounds induces superconductivity in the parent compounds, and enhances the
Tc largely in some superconducting ones. Furthermore, the existence of proton
in the lattice enables the first proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study
to probe directly superconductivity. Using FeS as a model system, our NMR study
reveals an emergent high-Tc phase with no coherence peak which is hard to
measure by NMR with other isotopes. This novel electric-field-induced proton
evolution opens up an avenue for manipulation of competing electronic states
(e.g. Mott insulators), and may provide an innovative way for a broad
perspective of NMR measurements with greatly enhanced detecting resolution.

providing unprecedented human-like performance in solving many real-world
problems such as image and speech recognition. Training of large DNNs, however,
is a computationally intensive task, and this necessitates the development of
novel computing architectures targeting this application. A computational
memory unit where resistive memory devices are organized in crossbar arrays can
be used to locally store the synaptic weights in their conductance states. The
expensive multiply accumulate operations can be performed in place using
Kirchhoff's circuit laws in a non-von Neumann manner. However, a key challenge
remains the inability to alter the conductance states of the devices in a
reliable manner during the weight update process. We propose a mixed-precision
architecture that combines a computational memory unit storing the synaptic
weights with a digital processing unit and an additional memory unit
accumulating weight updates in high precision. The new architecture delivers
classification accuracies comparable to those of floating-point implementations
without being constrained by challenges associated with the non-ideal weight
update characteristics of emerging resistive memories. A two layer neural
network in which the computational memory unit is realized using non-linear
stochastic models of phase-change memory devices achieves a test accuracy of
97.40% on the MNIST handwritten digit classification problem.

universal logic gate that concurrently evaluates and, nand, nor, and or

evaluate any logical expression. However, we establish that simulating the full
range of complex interactions present in arbitrary digital circuits encounters
a fundamental difficulty: a fan-out gate cannot be generated. We resolve this
missing component with the help of 2x1 particles, which can create fan-out

reliable [Fe/H] and effective temperatures for FGK dwarf stars -- the primary

exoplanets orbit statistically more metal-enriched host stars. This effect may
trace a metallicity dependence of the protoplanetary disk inner-radius at the

inward planetary migration. We also consider that this may trace a metallicity
dependence of the dust sublimation radius, but find no statistically
significant correlation with host $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and orbital period to
support such a claim.

  Data","Working paper",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the past few years advancements in sports information systems and
technology has allowed us to collect a number of detailed spatio-temporal data
capturing various aspects of basketball. For example, shot charts, that is,
maps capturing locations of (made or missed) shots, and spatio-temporal
trajectories for all the players on the court can capture information about the
offensive and defensive tendencies and schemes of a team. Characterization of
these processes is important for player and team comparisons, pre-game
scouting, game preparation etc. Playing tendencies among teams have
traditionally been compared in a heuristic manner. Recently automated ways for
similar comparisons have appeared in the sports analytics literature. However,
these approaches are almost exclusively focused on the spatial distribution of
the underlying actions (usually shots taken), ignoring a multitude of other
parameters that can affect the action studied. In this work, we propose a
framework based on tensor decomposition for obtaining a set of prototype
spatio-temporal patterns based on the core spatiotemporal information and
contextual meta-data. The core of our framework is a 3D tensor X, whose
dimensions represent the entity under consideration (team, player, possession
etc.), the location on the court and time. We make use of the PARAFAC
decomposition and we decompose the tensor into several interpretable patterns,
that can be thought of as prototype patterns of the process examined (e.g.,
shot selection, offensive schemes etc.). We also introduce an approach for
choosing the number of components to be considered. Using the tensor
components, we can then express every entity as a weighted combination of these
components. The framework introduced in this paper can have further
applications in the work-flow of the basketball operations of a franchise,
which we also briefly discuss.

obstructions on streaming potential and energy conversion efficiency in a
narrow fluidic confinement taking into consideration the wall hydrodynamic
slip, finite ionic size, and local permittivity variation effects. We consider
two types of the geometric pattern of flow obstacle between which regular
pattern turns out to be more effective. It is observed that, implementing
structured flow obstacles of radii greater than 10% of channel height and
charge density ratio (charge density of flow obstacle surface to that of
channel wall) greater than or equal to 9 renders significant enhancement of
power generation efficiency. On the other hand, it is effective to operate at a
charge density ratio~1 for obstacles radii less than or equal to 10% of channel
height. An effective normalized pitch length of magnitude 0.6 or above has to
be maintained in order to obtain optimum energy conversion efficiency. We found
that implementation of charged flow obstacle causes a significant enhancement
of energy conversion efficiency (~18% with regular pattern) comparing to planar
slit channel (~4%) without considering wall hydrodynamic slip and steric
effects. Introducing finite ionic size and wall hydrodynamic slip effect,
pertinent to flows in narrow confinement, leads to further enhancement in

counter-Evershed flows in a radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a
sunspot and compare them with the forces acting on the normal Evershed flow.
The simulation covers a timespan of 100 solar hours and generates an Evershed
outflow exceeding 8 km s$^{-1}$ in the penumbra along radially aligned
filaments where the magnetic field is almost horizontal. Additionally, the
simulation produces a fast counter-Evershed flow (i.e., an inflow near $\tau =
1$) in some regions within the penumbra, reaching peak flow speeds of $\sim$12
km s$^{-1}$. The counter-Evershed flows are transient and typically last a few
hours before they turn into outflows again. By using the kinetic energy
equation and evaluating its various terms in the simulation box, we found that
the Evershed flow occurs due to overturning convection in a strongly inclined
magnetic field while the counter-Evershed flows can be well described as siphon

provided the most widely adopted measurements of the quasar luminosity function

revealed that the SDSS quasar selection is in fact missing a significant
fraction of $z\gtrsim3$ quasars at the brightest end. We have identified the
purely optical color selection of SDSS, where quasars at these redshifts are
strongly contaminated by late-type dwarfs, and the spectroscopic incompleteness
of the SDSS footprint as the main reasons. Therefore we have designed the
Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS), based on a novel near-infrared JKW2

simulations plays a critical role in shaping galaxy properties. In the first
paper of the series, we presented a new method to model star formation as a
collection of star clusters. In this paper, we improve the algorithm by
eliminating accretion gaps, boosting momentum feedback, and introducing a
subgrid initial bound fraction, $f_i$, that distinguishes cluster mass from
stellar particle mass. We perform a suite of simulations with different star
formation efficiency per freefall time $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ and supernova
momentum feedback intensity $f_{\rm boost}$. We find that the star formation
history of a Milky Way-sized galaxy is sensitive to $f_{\rm boost}$, which
allows us to constrain its value, $f_{\rm boost}\approx5$, in the current
simulation setup. Changing $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from a few percent to 200\% has
little effect on global galaxy properties. However, on smaller scales, the
properties of star clusters are very sensitive to $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. We find
that $f_i$ increases with $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ and cluster mass. Through the
dependence on $f_i$, the shape of the cluster initial mass function varies
strongly with $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. The fraction of clustered star formation and
maximum cluster mass increase with the star formation rate surface density,
with the normalization of both relations dependent on $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. The
cluster formation timescale systematically decreases with increasing
$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. Local variations in the gas accretion history lead to a
0.25~dex scatter for the integral cluster formation efficiency. Joint
constraints from all the observables prefer the runs that produce a median
integral efficiency of 16\%.

collision dynamics of rigid spheres via adjustable parameters. We compute the
exact statistical steady state of the system, and determine the form of its
marginal distributions for a large number of spheres. We find that the
Kullback-Leibler entropy (a generalization of the conventional Boltzmann
entropy) of the full system of random gas spheres is a nonincreasing function
of time. Unlike the conventional hard sphere model, the proposed random gas
model results in a variant of the Enskog equation, which is known to be a more
accurate model of dense gas than the Boltzmann equation. We examine the
hydrodynamic limit of the derived Enskog equation for spheres of constant mass
density, and find that the corresponding Enskog-Euler and Enskog-Navier-Stokes
equations acquire additional effects in both the advective and viscous terms.
In the dilute gas approximation, the Enskog equation simplifies to the
Boltzmann equation, while the Enskog-Euler and Enskog-Navier-Stokes equations
become the conventional Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.

Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average
power, input amplitude and output delivered power is studied. The output
delivered power constraint is modelled as the average of linear combination of
even moments of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown
that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver
delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel
under an average power constraint. However, depending on the two constraints,
the capacity can be either achieved by a Gaussian distribution or arbitrarily
approached by using time-sharing between a Gaussian distribution and On-Off
Keying. As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated
nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power
depends on higher order moments of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one
based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on further restricting the
delivered power are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian
inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between transmitted
information and delivered power is recognized by considering asymmetric power
allocations between inphase and quadrature subchannels. Through numerical
algorithms, it is observed that input distributions (obtained by restricting
the delivered power) attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input
counterparts.

galaxy, NGC 1407, by constructing spherically symmetric Jeans models of its
field star and globular cluster systems. Two major challenges in such models
are the degeneracy between the stellar mass and the dark matter halo profiles,
and the degeneracy between the orbital anisotropy of the tracer population and
the total mass causing the observed motions. We address the first issue by
using new measurements of the mass-to-light ratio profile from stellar
population constraints that include a radially varying initial mass function.
To deal with the mass--anisotropy degeneracy, we make use of multiple kinematic
tracers, including two subpopulations of globular clusters in addition to the
galaxy's field stars. We create a hierarchical Bayesian model that addresses
several often neglected systematic uncertainties, such as the statistical
weight given to various datasets and the adopted distance. After sampling the
posterior probability distribution with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we
find evidence for a central cusp with a log-slope of $\gamma =
1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$. This is lower than expected for dark matter halos that have
undergone adiabatic contraction, supporting inferences from gravitational
lensing that some process has suppressed the steepening of halos in massive
galaxies. We also confirm radially-biased orbits for the metal-rich globular

we study the following question: what properties of real-world instances will
enable us to design efficient algorithms and prove guarantees for finding the
optimal clustering? We consider a natural notion called additive perturbation
stability that we believe captures many practical instances. Stable instances
have unique optimal k-means solutions that do not change even when each point
is perturbed a little (in Euclidean distance). This captures the property that
the k-means optimal solution should be tolerant to measurement errors and
uncertainty in the points. We design efficient algorithms that provably recover
the optimal clustering for instances that are additive perturbation stable.
When the instance has some additional separation, we show an efficient
algorithm with provable guarantees that is also robust to outliers. We
complement these results by studying the amount of stability in real datasets

demonstrate how resonantly Sommerfeld enhanced cross sections emerge to induce
the reannihilation epoch. The effect is a temporally local modification of the
Hubble expansion rate and we show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

observe this phenomenon. Special attention is given to the model region where
late kinetic decoupling and strong self-interactions can alleviate several
small-scale problems in the cold dark matter paradigm at the same time.

discriminate between the phenomenologically otherwise almost identical vector

the torsional oscillations and in their velocity contours relationship to solar
magnetogram; the power to the chromosphere; power to the corona and the solar
wind; the current in the helio-current-sheet measured at the radius of the
orbit of Earth; the calculated size ($\sim$1 Mm) of the expanding polar flux
when it enters the photosphere; and from the observation that solar magnetic
activity is generated near the surface. A thin stable minimum energy state
seems to be covering most of the solar surface just below the photosphere. The
magnetic field lines should be parallel to the solar surface and rotate with
distance from the surface for 2$\pi$ radians in $\sim$2 Mm. Resistive diffusion
helps to push the magnetic fields to the surface and the GMS seems to lose
$\pi$ radians every 11 years, causing the observed 180$^\circ$ flipping of the
solar magnetic fields including the flipping of the polar flux. Further
evidence for this GMS and its loss is that solar prominences are made of thin
sheets of magnetized plasma, which are, likely, remnants of the lost thin sheet
of the GMS. The loss process is consistent with the butterfly pattern of the
sunspots and with the differences observed between solar maximum and solar
minimum in the corona. The solar dynamo drives current parallel to the polar
flux, which, in turn, sustains the GMS using cross-field current drive. For
completeness, the formation of sunspots, CMEs and flares is discussed.

dependency of dynamos. We further apply the test-field method to determine the
$\alpha$ effect in these simulations. We find dynamo with clear oscillating
mean magnetic fields for moderately and rapidly rotating runs. For slower
rotation, the field is constant or exhibit irregular cycles. In the moderately

This behavior can be well explained with a Parker-Yoshimura dynamo wave
traveling equatorward. Even though the $\alpha$ effect becomes stronger for
increasing rotation, the shear decreases steeper, causing this weak dependence
on rotation. Similar as other numerical studies, we find no indication of
activity branches as suggested by Brandenburg et al. (1998). However, our
simulation seems to agree more with the transitional branch suggested by

chemical potentials in the presence of an external magnetic field. This system
supports electric and axial isospin currents along the magnetic field which

can capture the dependence of chiral effects on other infrared parameters.

< 4$ based on a sample of $236$ star-forming galaxies from the VANDELS

simulation project, we argue that the intrinsic spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts have a self-similar shape
across the mass range $8.2 \leq$ log$(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 10.6$ probed by
our sample. Using FiBY data, we construct a set of intrinsic SED templates
which incorporate both detailed star formation and chemical abundance
histories, and a variety of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model
assumptions. With this set of intrinsic SEDs, we present a novel approach for
directly recovering the shape and normalization of the dust attenuation curve.
We find, across all of the intrinsic templates considered, that the average
attenuation curve for star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq3.5$ is similar in shape
to the commonly-adopted Calzetti starburst law, with an average
total-to-selective attenuation ratio of $R_{V}=4.18\pm0.29$. We show that the
optical attenuation ($A_V$) versus stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) relation
predicted using our method is consistent with recent ALMA observations of
galaxies at $2<z<3$ in the \emph{Hubble} \emph{Ultra} \emph{Deep} \emph{Field}

Calzetti-like law. Our results, combined with other literature data, suggest
that the $A_V - M_{\star}$ relation does not evolve over the redshift range
$0<z<5$, at least for galaxies with log$(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \gtrsim 9.5$.
Finally, we present tentative evidence which suggests that the attenuation
curve may become steeper at log$(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9.0$.

to model the experimental response function. A typical application are
forward-folding likelihood analyses with re-weighting, or time-consuming

Problematically, the finite size of such Monte Carlo samples carries intrinsic
uncertainty that can lead to a substantial bias in parameter estimation if it
is neglected and the sample size is small. We introduce a probabilistic
treatment of this problem by replacing the usual likelihood functions with
novel generalized probability distributions that incorporate the finite
statistics via suitable marginalization. These new PDFs are analytic, and can
be used to replace the Poisson, multinomial, and sample-based unbinned
likelihoods, which covers many use cases in high-energy physics. In the limit
of infinite statistics, they reduce to the respective standard probability
distributions. In the general case of arbitrary Monte Carlo weights, the
expressions involve the fourth Lauricella function $F_D$, for which we find a
new finite-sum representation in a certain parameter setting. The result also
represents an exact form for Carlson's Dirichlet average $R_n$ with $n>0$, and
thereby an efficient way to calculate the probability generating function of
the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, the extended divided difference of a
monomial, or arbitrary moments of univariate B-splines. We demonstrate the bias
reduction of our approach with a typical toy Monte Carlo problem, estimating
the normalization of a peak in a falling energy spectrum, and compare the

the issue of to what extent the WGC actually constrains EFTs. For this purpose,
for a given EFT, I introduce associated idealized low energy observers who only
have access to the energy scale below the UV cut-off scale of the EFT. In the
framework of EFT, there is a clear difference between the particles lighter
than the UV cut-off scale and the particles which are heavier than the UV
cut-off scale, as the lighter particles can be created below the UV cut-off
scale while the heavier particles are not. This difference implies that the
knowledge of the low energy observers on the stable heavy particles can be
limited, as the availability of the stable heavy particles is determined by the
environment prepared by some UV theory unknown to the low energy observers. The
limitation of the knowledge of the low energy observers regarding the stable
heavy particles whose mass is above the UV cut-off scale of the EFT leads to
the limitation of the WGC for constraining EFTs. To illustrate these points in
an example, I analyze a model proposed by Saraswat arXiv:1608.06951 which
respects the WGC at high energy, but which may appear to violate the WGC for
the low energy observers. Implications of the analysis to the bottom-up model
buildings using EFTs are discussed.

experience neutrino-driven, turbulence-aided explosions triggered by the
arrival of density discontinuities at the shock. These occur typically at the
silicon/silicon-oxygen shell boundary. (3) Progenitors with small cores and
density profiles without strong discontinuities experience shock recession and
develop the 3D standing-accretion shock instability (SASI). Shock runaway
ensues late, once declining accretion rate, SASI, and neutrino-driven
convection create favorable conditions. These differences in explosion times
and dynamics result in a non-monotonic relationship between progenitor and
compact remnant mass.

While propulsion
speed is an important property of locomotion, efficiency is another factor that
may determine the swimming gait adopted by a micro-organism in order to
locomote in an energetically favorable manner. The efficiency of swimming in a
Newtonian fluid is well characterized for different biological and artificial
swimmers. However, these swimmers often encounter biological fluids displaying
shear-thinning viscosities. Little is known about how this nonlinear rheology
influences the efficiency of locomotion. Does the shear-thinning rheology
render swimming more efficient or less? How does the swimming efficiency depend
on the propulsion mechanism of a swimmer and rheological properties of the
surrounding shear-thinning fluid? In this work, we address these fundamental
questions on the efficiency of locomotion in a shear-thinning fluid by
considering the squirmer model as a general locomotion model to represent
different types of swimmers. Our analysis reveals how the choice of surface
velocity distribution on a squirmer may reduce or enhance the swimming
efficiency. We determine optimal shear rates at which the swimming efficiency
can be substantially enhanced com- pared with the Newtonian case. The
non-trivial variations of swimming efficiency prompt questions on how
micro-organisms may tune their swimming gaits to exploit the shear-thinning
rheology. The findings also provide insights into how artificial swimmers

uncover a profound enhancement of the number of improper ferroelectric coupling
schemes available to \emph{molecular} perovskites. This enhancement arises
because molecular substitution on the A- and/or X-site significantly
diversifies the range of distortions possible. Not only do our insights
rationalise the emergence of polarisation in a number of previously-studied
materials, but we identify the fundamental importance of molecular degrees of
freedom at the A-site, which are much more straightforwardly controlled from a

up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC,
well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of $L_0$ regularization.
However, since the $L_0$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot
incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We
propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative
stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We
show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the
expected $L_0$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with
respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the \emph{hard
concrete} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by ""stretching"" a
binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a
hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be
jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method
allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with
stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a
principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness

poses a fine-tuning challenge to current models of galaxy formation. We propose
that this relation could arise from collisional interactions between baryons
and dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for modification of gravity or
ad hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy the
following three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is
comparable to the dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy
with baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM
cross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely
proportional to the DM number density. We present an example of a particle
physics model that gives a DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and
velocity dependence. Direct detection constraints require our DM particles to
be either very light ($m << m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding
respectively to heating and cooling of DM by baryons. In both cases, our
mechanism applies and an equilibrium configuration can in principle be reached.
Here, we focus on the heavy DM/cooling case as it is technically simpler. Under
these assumptions, we find that rotationally-supported disk galaxies could
naturally settle to equilibrium configurations satisfying a MDAR at all radii
without invoking finely tuned feedback processes. We also discuss issues
related to the small scale clumpiness of baryons, as well as predictions for
pressure-supported systems. We argue in particular that galaxy clusters do not
follow the MDAR despite being DM-dominated because they have not reached their
equilibrium configuration. Finally, we revisit existing phenomenological,
astrophysical and cosmological constraints on baryon-DM interactions in light
of the unusual density dependence of the cross section.

  minor corrections","Phys. Rev. D 97, 085009 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevD.97.085009",,"gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is the first of a series of papers in which we use analyticity
properties of quantum fields propagating on a spacetime to uncover a new
multiverse geometry when the classical geometry has horizons and/or
singularities. The nature and origin of the multiverse idea presented in this
paper, that is shared by the fields in the standard model coupled to gravity,
is different from other notions of a multiverse. Via analyticity we are able to
establish definite relations among the universes. In this paper we illustrate
these properties for the extended Rindler space, while black hole spacetime and
the cosmological geometry of mini-superspace (see Appendix B) will appear in
later papers. In classical general relativity, extended Rindler space is
equivalent to flat Minkowski space; it consists of the union of the four wedges
in (u,v) light-cone coordinates as in Fig.(1). In quantum mechanics, the
wavefunction is an analytic function of (u,v) that is sensitive to branch
points at the horizons u=0 or v=0, with branch cuts attached to them. The
wavefunction is uniquely defined by analyticity on an infinite number of sheets
in the cut analytic (u,v) spacetime. This structure is naturally interpreted as
an infinite stack of identical Minkowski geometries, or universes, connected to
each other by analyticity across branch cuts, such that each sheet represents a
different Minkowski universe when (u,v) are analytically continued to the real
axis on any sheet. We show in this paper that, in the absence of interactions,
information doesn't flow from one Rindler sheet to another. By contrast, for an
eternal black hole spacetime, which may be viewed as a modification of Rindler
that includes gravitational interactions, analyticity shows how information is
lost due to a flow to other universes, enabled by an additional branch point
and cut due to the black hole singularity.

a bright radio relic, known as the Toothbrush, and an elongated giant radio
halo. These new observations allow us to study the surface brightness
distribution down to one arcsec resolution with very high sensitivity. Our
images provide an unprecedented detailed view of the Toothbrush, revealing
enigmatic filamentary structures. To study the spectral index distribution, we
complement our analysis with published LOFAR and GMRT observations. The bright
`brush' of the Toothbrush shows a prominent narrow ridge to its north with a
sharp outer edge. The spectral index at the ridge is in the range
$-0.70\leq\alpha\leq-0.80$. We suggest that the ridge is caused by projection
along the line of sight. With a simple toy model for the smallest region of the
ridge, we conclude that the magnetic field is below $5\,\rm\mu G$ and varies
significantly across the shock front. Our model indicates that the actual Mach
number is higher than that obtained from the injection index and agrees well
with the one derived from the overall spectrum, namely ${\cal
M}=3.78^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$. The radio halo shows an average spectral index of
$\alpha=-1.16\pm0.05$ and a slight gradient from north to south. The
southernmost part of the halo is steeper and possibly related to a shock front.
Excluding the southernmost part, the halo morphology agrees very well with the
X-ray morphology. A power-law correlation is found between the radio and X-ray
surface brightness

participation from users. Applications across every marketing domain can now be
accessed through mobile or web where users can directly perform certain actions
and reach a desired outcome. Actions of user on a system, though, can be
representative of a certain intent. Ability to learn this intent through user's
actions can help draw certain insight into the behavior of users on a system.
  In this paper, we present models to optimize interactive systems by learning
and analyzing user intent through their actions on the system. We present a
four phased model that uses time-series of interaction actions sequentially
using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based sequence learning system that helps
build a model for intent recognition. Our system then provides an objective
specific maximization followed by analysis and contrasting methods in order to
identify spaces of improvement in the interaction system. We discuss deployment
scenarios for such a system and present results from evaluation on an online

with the cards in each pair bearing identical pictures. The cards are laid
face-down. A move consists of revealing two cards, chosen adaptively. If these
cards match, i.e., they bear the same picture, they are removed from play;
otherwise, they are turned back to face down. The object of the game is to
clear all cards while minimizing the number of moves. Past works have
thoroughly studied the expected number of moves required, assuming optimal play
by a player has that has perfect memory. In this work, we study the Memory game
in a space-bounded setting.
  We prove two time-space tradeoff lower bounds on algorithms (strategies for
the player) that clear all cards in $T$ moves while using at most $S$ bits of
memory. First, in a simple model where the pictures on the cards may only be
compared for equality, we prove that $ST = \Omega(n^2 \log n)$. This is tight:
it is easy to achieve $ST = O(n^2 \log n)$ essentially everywhere on this
tradeoff curve. Second, in a more general model that allows arbitrary
computations, we prove that $ST^2 = \Omega(n^3)$. We prove this latter tradeoff
by modeling strategies as branching programs and extending a classic counting
argument of Borodin and Cook with a novel probabilistic argument. We conjecture
that the stronger tradeoff $ST = \widetilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ in fact holds even in
this general model.

particles has been systematically studied in Cu+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV for harmonics $n=$ 1-4 in the pseudorapidity range
$|\eta|<1$. The directed flow in Cu+Au collisions is compared with the
rapidity-odd and, for the first time, the rapidity-even components of charged
particle directed flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200~GeV. The
slope of the directed flow pseudorapidity dependence in Cu+Au collisions is
found to be similar to that in Au+Au collisions, with the intercept shifted
toward positive $\eta$ values, i.e., the Cu-going direction. The mean
transverse momentum projected onto the spectator plane, $\langle p_x\rangle$,
in Cu+Au collision also exhibits approximately linear dependence on $\eta$ with
the intercept at about $\eta\approx-0.4$, closer to the rapidity of the Cu+Au
system center-of-mass. The observed dependencies find natural explanation in a
picture of the directed flow originating partly due the ""tilted source"" and
partly due to the rapidity dependent asymmetry in the initial density
distribution. Charge-dependence of the $\langle p_x\rangle$ was also observed
in Cu+Au collisions, indicating an effect of the initial electric field created
by charge difference of the spectator protons in two colliding nuclei. The
rapidity-even component of directed flow in Au+Au collisions is close to that
in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV, indicating a similar
magnitude of dipole-like fluctuations in the initial-state density
distribution. Higher harmonic flow in Cu+Au collisions exhibits similar trends
to those observed in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions and is qualitatively reproduced
by a viscous hydrodynamic model and a multi-phase transport model. For all
harmonics with $n\ge2$ we observe an approximate scaling of $v_n$ with the
number of constituent quarks.

arises from a set of simple rules governing local interactions between
individuals. In theoretical models, these rules are normally \emph{assumed} to
take a particular form, possibly constrained by heuristic arguments. We propose
a new class of models, which describe the individuals as \emph{agents}, capable
of deciding for themselves how to act and learning from their experiences. The
local interaction rules do not need to be postulated in this model, since they
\emph{emerge} from the learning process. We apply this ansatz to a concrete
scenario involving marching locusts, in order to model the phenomenon of
density-dependent alignment. We show that our learning agent-based model can
account for a Fokker-Planck equation that describes the collective motion and,
most notably, that the agents can learn the appropriate local interactions,
requiring no strong previous assumptions on their form. These results suggest
that learning agent-based models are a powerful tool for studying a broader
class of problems involving collective motion and animal agency in general.

irreducible subvariety.
  We say that a function $f:X(k) \to k$ is weakly linear if its restriction to
any two-dimensional linear subspace $W$ of $V$ contained in $X$ is linear and
that it is weakly quadratic if its restriction to any three-dimensional linear
subspace $W$ of $V$ contained in $X$ is quadratic.
  We say that $X$ is admissible if any weakly linear function on $X$ is a
restriction of a linear function on $V$ and any weakly quadratic function on
$X$ is a restriction of a quadratic function on $V$.
  The main result in the paper concerns the case when the field $k$ is a
finite. We show that for any $d,L\geq 1$ there exists $r=r(d,L,k)\in \mathbb Z
_+$ such that any complete intersection $X\in V$ in a vector space $V$ of
codimension $L$, degree $d$ and rank $\geq r$ is admissible.
  Moreover we show the existence of a function $r(d,L)$ such that one can take
$r(d,L,k)=r(d,L)$ for all finite fields $k$ of characteristic $>d$.
  The proof of the admissibility for finite fields $k$ is based on bounds on
the number of $k$-points on ancillary varieties $E(X)$. These results allow us
to bound the dimension of varieties $E(X)$. Using these results we were able to
prove the admissibility of complex homogeneous varieties of high rank.
  Using the results of \cite{br} one can extend our proofs to show the
admissibility of varieties of high rank over local non-archimedian fields. Also
using Corollary $4.3$ of \cite{cmpv} one can dispense with the assumption that

are optimization driven: they optimize the parameters of a 3D human model so
that its re-projection matches measurements in the video (e.g. person
segmentation, optical flow, keypoint detections etc.). Optimization models are
susceptible to local minima. This has been the bottleneck that forced using
clean green-screen like backgrounds at capture time, manual initialization, or
switching to multiple cameras as input resource. In this work, we propose a
learning based motion capture model for single camera input. Instead of
optimizing mesh and skeleton parameters directly, our model optimizes neural
network weights that predict 3D shape and skeleton configurations given a
monocular RGB video. Our model is trained using a combination of strong
supervision from synthetic data, and self-supervision from differentiable
rendering of (a) skeletal keypoints, (b) dense 3D mesh motion, and (c)
human-background segmentation, in an end-to-end framework. Empirically we show
our model combines the best of both worlds of supervised learning and test-time
optimization: supervised learning initializes the model parameters in the right
regime, ensuring good pose and surface initialization at test time, without
manual effort. Self-supervision by back-propagating through differentiable
rendering allows (unsupervised) adaptation of the model to the test data, and
offers much tighter fit than a pretrained fixed model. We show that the
proposed model improves with experience and converges to low-error solutions

  for the Cahn-Hilliard equation","31 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes and analyzes the Morley element method for the
Cahn-Hilliard equation. It is a fourth order nonlinear singular perturbation
equation arises from the binary alloy problem in materials science, and its
limit is proved to approach the Hele-Shaw flow. If the $L^2(\Omega)$ error
estimate is considered directly as in paper \cite{elliott1989nonconforming}, we
can only prove that the error bound depends on the exponential function of
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$. Instead, this paper derives the error bound which depends
on the polynomial function of $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ by considering the discrete
$H^{-1}$ error estimate first. There are two main difficulties in proving this
polynomial dependence of the discrete $H^{-1}$ error estimate. Firstly, it is
difficult to prove discrete energy law and discrete stability results due to
the complex structure of the bilinear form of the Morley element
discretization. This paper overcomes this difficulty by defining four types of
discrete inverse Laplace operators and exploring the relations between these
discrete inverse Laplace operators and continuous inverse Laplace operator.
Each of these operators plays important roles, and their relations are crucial
in proving the discrete energy law, discrete stability results and error
estimates. Secondly, it is difficult to prove the discrete spectrum estimate in
the Morley element space because the Morley element space intersects with the
$C^1$ conforming finite element space but they are not contained in each other.
Instead of proving this discrete spectrum estimate in the Morley element space,
this paper proves a generalized coercivity result by exploring properties of
the enriching operators and using the discrete spectrum estimate in its $C^1$
conforming relative finite element space, which can be obtained by using the
spectrum estimate of the Cahn-Hilliard operator.

improving the localization and mapping processes in the most challenging

  To prove that a robot performed a loop whatever the uncertainties in its
evolution, we employ the notion of topological degree that originates in the

demonstrated both on datasets from real missions involving autonomous

with a landscape of chiral superfields and one $U(1)$ shift symmetry which is
broken by non-perturbative symmetry breaking terms in the superpotential. We
label the pseudo scalar component of the chiral fields axions and their real
parts saxions. Thus in the models only one combination of axions will be a
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-boson which will act as the inflaton. The proposed
models constitute consistent inflation for the following reasons: The inflation
potential arises dynamically with stabilized saxions, the axion decay constant
can lie in the sub-Planckian region, and consistency with the Planck data is
achieved. The axion landscape consisting of $m$ axion pairs is assumed with the
axions in each pair having opposite charges. A fast roll--slow roll splitting
mechanism for the axion potential is proposed which is realized with a special
choice of the axion basis. In this basis the $2m$ coupled equations split into
$2m-1$ equations which enter in the fast roll and there is one unique linear
combination of the $2m$ fields which controls the slow roll and thus the power
spectrum of curvature and tensor perturbations. It is shown that a significant
part of the parameter space exists where inflation is successful, i.e., $N_{\rm
pivot} = {[50, 60]}$, the spectral index $n_s$ of curvature perturbations, and
the ratio $r$ of the power spectrum of tensor perturbations and curvature
perturbations, lie in the experimentally allowed regions given by the Planck
experiment. Further, it is shown that the model allows for a significant region
of the parameter space where the effective axion decay constant can lie in the
sub-Planckian domain.

inherently introduce self-occlusion and illumination/appearance/shape changes,
resulting in highly fragmented trajectory reconstruction with noisy and coarse
semantic labels. Our conjecture is that among many views, there exists a set of

probability distribution over the semantic labels per trajectory. We construct
the 3D semantic map by reasoning about visibility and 2D recognition confidence
based on view-pooling, i.e., finding the view that best represents the
semantics of the trajectory. Using the 3D semantic map, we precisely infer all
trajectory labels jointly by considering the affinity between long range
trajectories via estimating their local rigid transformations. This inference
quantitatively outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of predictive
validity, representation robustness, and affinity effectiveness. We demonstrate
that our algorithm can robustly compute the semantic labels of a large scale

$^{12}$CO2$-$1 emission from circumstellar material around the massive star

equatorial torus located $\sim$4000 au from the star. The CO torus is not a
complete azimuthal loop, but rather, is missing its near side, which appears to
have been cleared away. The missing material matches the direction of apastron
in the eccentric binary system, making it likely that $\eta$~Car's companion
played an important role in disrupting portions of the torus soon after
ejection. Molecular gas seen in ALMA data aligns well with the cool dust around
$\eta$~Car previously observed in mid-infrared (IR) maps, whereas hot dust
resides at the inner surface of the molecular torus. The CO also coincides with
the spatial and velocity structure of near-IR H$_2$ emission. Together, these
suggest that the CO torus seen by ALMA is actually the pinched waist of the
Homunculus polar lobes, which glows brightly because it is close to the star
and warmer than the poles. The near side of the torus appears to be a blowout,
associated with fragmented equatorial ejecta. We discuss implications for the
origin of various features northwest of the star. CO emission from the main
torus implies a total gas mass in the range of 0.2-1 $M_{\odot}$ (possibly up
to 5 $M_{\odot}$ or more, although with questionable assumptions). Deeper
observations are needed to constrain CO emission from the cool polar lobes.

provides a useful data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for

associated with EDMD: a trade-off between representational capacity of the
dictionary and over-fitting due to insufficient data. A new neural network
architecture combining an autoencoder with linear recurrent dynamics in the
encoded state is used to learn a low-dimensional and highly informative
Koopman-invariant subspace of observables. A method is also presented for
balanced model reduction of over-specified EDMD systems in feature space.
Nonlinear reconstruction using partially linear multi-kernel regression aims to
improve reconstruction accuracy from the low-dimensional state when the data
has complex but intrinsically low-dimensional structure. The techniques
demonstrate the ability to identify Koopman eigenfunctions of the unforced

suggesting a partial disruption of the central region of the wind collision

the complex shock fronts. The variability of its equivalent width indicates
that the fluorescence region has a complex geometry and that the source

the ultraintense laser interacts with the counter-propagating relativistic

effects of RR are significant in a few laser period for a relativistic
electron. However, the laser at such intensity is tightly focused and the laser
energy is usually assumed to be fixed. Then, the signal of RR and energy
conservation cannot be guaranteed. To assess the effects of RR in a tightly
focused laser pulse and the evolution of the laser energy, we simulate this
interaction with a beam of $10^9$ electrons by means of Particle-in-Cell (PIC)
method. We observed that the effects of RR are suppressed due to the
ponderomotive force and accompanied by a non-negligible amount of laser field
energy reduction. This is due to the ponderomotive force that prevents the
electrons from approaching the center of the laser pulse and leads to the
interaction at weaker field region. At the same time, the laser energy is
absorbed through ponderomotive acceleration. Thus, the kinetic energy of the
electron beam has to be carefully selected such that the effects of RR become
obvious.

Knowledge of the prices of options at every strike is equivalent to knowing the
entire pricing distribution for a security, as derivatives contingent on the
security can be replicated using options. The available data may be
insufficient to determine this distribution precisely, however, and the
question arises: What are the bounds for the option price at a specified
strike, given the market-implied constraints?
  Positivity of the price map imposed by the principle of no-arbitrage is here
utilised, via the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, to transform the problem
into the domain of operator algebras. Optimisation in this larger context is
essentially geometric, and the outcome is simultaneously super-optimal for all
commutative subalgebras.
  This generates an upper bound for the price of a basket option. With
innovative decomposition of the assets in the basket, the result is used to
create converging families of price bounds for vanilla options, interpolate the
volatility smile, price options on cross FX rates, and analyse the
relationships between swaption and caplet prices.

angular resolution and short duration of observation, LIGO can detect the GW
lensing induced by compact structures, in particular by compact dark matter
(DM) or primordial black holes of $10 - 10^5 \, M_\odot$, which remain
interesting DM candidates. The lensing is detected through GW frequency
chirping, creating the natural and rapid change of lensing patterns:
\emph{frequency-dependent amplification and modulation} of GW waveforms. As a
highest-frequency GW detector, LIGO is a unique GW lab to probe such light
compact DM. With the design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, one-year observation
by three detectors can optimistically constrain the compact DM density fraction
$f_{\rm DM}$ to the level of a few percent.

they provide a statistically significant sample in the stellar mass range
$10^{9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}-10^{12.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, of $16,358$ galaxies. We
construct IFS-like cubes and measure stellar spin parameters, $\lambda_{\rm

rotators as in observations. The simulations display a primary dependence of
$F_{\rm SR}$ on stellar mass, with a weak dependence on environment. At fixed
stellar mass, satellite galaxies are more likely to be SRs than centrals.
$F_{\rm SR}$ shows a dependence on halo mass at fixed stellar mass for central
galaxies, while no such trend is seen for satellites. We find that $\approx
70$% of SRs at $z=0$ have experienced at least one merger with mass ratio $\ge
0.1$, with dry mergers being at least twice more common than wet mergers.
Individual dry mergers tend to decrease $\lambda_{\rm R}$, while wet mergers
mostly increase it. However, $30$% of SRs at $z=0$ have not experienced
mergers, and those inhabit halos with median spins twice smaller than the halos
hosting the rest of the SRs. Thus, although the formation paths of SRs can be
varied, dry mergers and/or halos with small spins dominate.

at least a decade to the work of Denef and Douglas on the statistics of flux
vacua. The assumption that an assortment of SUSY breaking F and D terms are
present in the hidden sector, and their values are uniformly distributed in the
landscape of D=4, N=1 effective supergravity models, leads to the expectation
that the landscape pulls towards large values of soft terms favored by a power
law behavior P(m(soft))~ m(soft)^n. On the other hand, similar to Weinberg's
prediction of the cosmological constant, one can assume an anthropic selection
of weak scales not too far from the measured value characterized by m(W,Z,h)~
100 GeV. Working within a fertile patch of gravity-mediated low energy
effective theories where the superpotential mu term is << m(3/2), as occurs in
models such as radiative breaking of Peccei-Quinn symmetry, this biases
statistical distributions on the landscape by a cutoff on the parameter
Delta(EW), which measures fine-tuning in the m(Z)-mu mass relation. The
combined effect of statistical and anthropic pulls turns out to favor low
energy phenomenology that is more or less agnostic to UV physics. While a
uniform selection n=0 of soft terms produces too low a value for m(h), taking
n=1 or 2 produce most probabilistically m(h)~125 GeV for negative trilinear
terms. For n>=1, there is a pull towards split generations with
m(squarks,sleptons)(1,2)~10-30 TeV whilst m(t1)~ 1-2 TeV. The most probable
gluino mass comes in at ~ 3-4 TeV--apparently beyond the reach of HL-LHC

large-scale computational modeling efforts. Nonetheless, these research agendas
have yet to prove decisively their value among the broader community of
theoretical and experimental biologists. In this commentary, we examine a range
of philosophical and practical issues relevant to understanding the potential
of integrative simulations. We discuss the role of theory and modeling in
different areas of physics and suggest that certain sub-disciplines of physics
provide useful cultural analogies for imagining the future role of simulations
in biological research. We examine philosophical issues related to modeling
which consistently arise in discussions about integrative simulations and
suggest a pragmatic viewpoint that balances a belief in philosophy with the
recognition of the relative infancy of our state of philosophical
understanding. Finally, we discuss community workflow and publication practices
to allow research to be readily discoverable and amenable to incorporation into
simulations. We argue that there are aligned incentives in widespread adoption
of practices which will both advance the needs of integrative simulation
efforts as well as other contemporary trends in the biological sciences,
ranging from open science and data sharing to improving reproducibility.

and the linear and nonlinear gain of the dielectric layer in the Otto
configuration. The surface confined wave modes such as surface plasmons or
waveguide modes are excited in the dielectric-metal bilayer by obliquely
incident $p$ waves. In the purely linear case, we find that the interplay
between linear gain and surface confined wave modes can generate a large
reflectance peak with its value much greater than 1. As the linear gain
parameter increases, the peak appears at smaller incident angles, and the
associated modes also change from surface plasmons to waveguide modes. When the
nonlinear gain is turned on, the reflectance shows very strong multistability
near the incident angles associated with surface confined wave modes. As the
nonlinear gain parameter is varied, the reflectance curve undergoes complicated
topological changes and sometimes displays separated closed curves. When the
nonlinear gain parameter takes an optimally small value, a giant amplification
of the reflectance by three orders of magnitude occurs near the incident angle
associated with a waveguide mode. We also find that there exists a range of the
incident angle where the wave is dissipated rather than amplified even in the
presence of gain. We suggest that this can provide the basis for a possible new
technology for thermal control in the subwavelength scale.

to SCUBA-2 dust distribution. The 82 GHz HC$_3$N, 82 GHz CCS, and 94 GHz CCS

cloud cores, is often very clumpy in the observed targets. We made deep
single-pointing observations in DNC, HN$^{13}$C, N$_2$D$^+$, cyclic C$_3$H$_2$

red giants with the goal of calibrating the mixing-length parameter of
convection as well as the asteroseismic surface term in models. We introduce a
new method to improve the identification of oscillation modes which exploits
theoretical frequencies to guide the mode identification ('peak-bagging') stage
of the data analysis. Our results indicate that the convective mixing-length
parameter (alpha) is about 14% larger for red giants than for the Sun, in
agreement with recent results from modelling the APOGEE stars. We found that
the asteroseismic surface term (i.e. the frequency offset between the observed
and predicted modes) correlates with stellar parameters (Teff, log g) and the
mixing-length parameter. This frequency offset generally decreases as giants
evolve. The two coefficients a_-1 and a_3 for the inverse and cubic terms that
have been used to describe the surface term correction are found to correlate
linearly. The effect of the surface term is also seen in the p-g mixed modes,
however, established methods for correcting the effect are not able to properly
correct the g-dominated modes in late evolved stars.

  Workshop",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering procedures typically estimate which data points are clustered
together, a quantity of primary importance in many analyses. Often used as a
preliminary step for dimensionality reduction or to facilitate interpretation,
finding robust and stable clusters is often crucial for appropriate for
downstream analysis. In the present work, we consider Bayesian nonparametric
(BNP) models, a particularly popular set of Bayesian models for clustering due
to their flexibility. Because of its complexity, the Bayesian posterior often
cannot be computed exactly, and approximations must be employed. Mean-field
variational Bayes forms a posterior approximation by solving an optimization
problem and is widely used due to its speed. An exact BNP posterior might vary
dramatically when presented with different data. As such, stability and
robustness of the clustering should be assessed.
  A popular mean to assess stability is to apply the bootstrap by resampling
the data, and rerun the clustering for each simulated data set. The time cost
is thus often very expensive, especially for the sort of exploratory analysis
where clustering is typically used. We propose to use a fast and automatic
approximation to the full bootstrap called the ""linear bootstrap"", which can be
seen by local data perturbation. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply this
idea to a data analysis pipeline, consisting of an MFVB approximation to a BNP
clustering posterior of time course gene expression data. We show that using
auto-differentiation tools, the necessary calculations can be done
automatically, and that the linear bootstrap is a fast but approximate
alternative to the bootstrap.

a counterpart given the medians instead, which carries an extra factor of
$\frac{4}{3}$. On the one hand, we formulate the pair of these in Linear
Algebra terms, showing that they are related by a sides-to-medians involution
$J$, which we find to furthermore commute with the `Heron map' $H$ as visible
in the expanded version of Heron. Upon further casting the pair of these in
terms of mass-weighted Jacobi coordinates, we find moreover that they are
placed on an exactly equal footing, the factor of $\frac{4}{3}$ having now
cancelled out. This motivates the `Heron--Jacobi' version of Heron's formulae,
for mass-weighted area in terms of mass-weighted sides and mass-weighted
medians respectively.
  On the other hand, we show that diagonalizing the Heron map $H$ provides new
derivations of, firstly, the famous Hopf map, and, secondly, of Kendall's
Theorem that the space of triangles is a sphere. This occurs by the
`Heron--Hopf' version of Heron's formula simplifying down to none other than
the on-sphere condition. Thus we establish that -- both an important fibre
bundle model, and a foundational theorem of Shape Theory: a widely applicable
Differential Geometry and Topology topic -- arise together as consequences of
just Heron's formula, Stewart's Theorem, and some elementary Linear Algebra
manipulations. This working also accounts for the extra factor of 4 in the Hopf
coordinate that is elsewise equal to the mass-weighted area in the 3-body
problem context. It finally offers a new interpretation of the shape-theoretic
ellipticity and anisoscelesness which realize the other two Hopf quantities: as

information. We show that, for sufficiently high temporal and spatial
resolution, NLOS components always provide position and orientation information

show that the information gain of NLOS components depends on the actual

high-mass YSOs (HMYSOs) are still embedded even when reaching the ZAMS. While
variable reflection nebulae around LMYSOs were among the earliest signs of star
formation, little is known on the variability of scattered light from embedded
clusters, the birthplaces of HMYSOs. Since the few most massive stars dominate
this emission, their variability is literally reflected in scattered light.
Moreover, because of their high luminosity, for a given ambient dust density
and source distance, the associated nebulosities are much larger than those of
LMYSOs. In this case, the light travel time becomes substantial. So the
apparent brightness distribution constitutes a light echo, shaped by both the
HMYSO variability history and the spatial distribution of the scattering
medium. We report on early results of a NIR variability study of HMYSOs

error for same and even smaller time step. In this paper, a wavelet finite
element model combined with precise integration method is presented for the
numerical simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation and crack identification in
1D structures. Firstly, the wavelet finite element based on BSWI is constructed
for rod and beam structures. Then Precise Integrated Method is introduced with
application for the wave propagation in 1D structures. Finally, numerical
examples of ultrasonic wave propagation in rod and beam structures are
conducted for verification. Moreover, crack identification in both rod and beam
structures are studied based on the new model.

organize extensive information, which can significantly alleviate the pain of
information overload. The critical challenge is the lack of widely recognized
definition of storyline metric. Prior studies have developed various approaches
based on different assumptions about users' interests. These works can extract
interesting patterns, but their assumptions do not guarantee that the derived
patterns will match users' preference. On the other hand, their exclusiveness
of single modality source misses cross-modality information. This paper
proposes a method, multimodal imitation learning via generative adversarial
networks(MIL-GAN), to directly model users' interests as reflected by various
data. In particular, the proposed model addresses the critical challenge by
imitating users' demonstrated storylines. Our proposed model is designed to
learn the reward patterns given user-provided storylines and then applies the
learned policy to unseen data. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be
capable of acquiring the user's implicit intent and outperforming competing
methods by a substantial margin with a user study.

flow to a cluster's formation site over an extended period, even as stars form

under the competing influences of accretion and feedback for several crossing
times, insofar as star formation is a slow process. The new-born stellar
cluster should therefore preserve a memory of this competition. Using
analytical approximations we assess the dynamical state of the gas, mapping
regimes in which various types of feedback are weak or strong. Protostellar
outflows, radiation pressure, and ionized gas pressure are accounted for.
Comparison to observations shows that feedback is often incapable of expelling
gas in the more massive, rapidly-accreting clusters, but feedback may
nevertheless starve accretion by acting on larger scales.

electric field intensity, measured during thunderstorms, has been found by
analyzing the data of the ARGO-YBJ experiment, a full coverage air shower array
located at the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a. s. l., Tibet,
China). The counting rates of showers with different particle multiplicities,
have been found to be strongly dependent upon the intensity and polarity of the
electric field measured during the course of 15 thunderstorms. In negative
electric fields (i.e. accelerating negative charges downwards), the counting
rates increase with increasing electric field strength. In positive fields, the
rates decrease with field intensity until a certain value of the field EFmin
(whose value depends on the event multiplicity), above which the rates begin
increasing. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that this peculiar
behavior can be well described by the presence of an electric field in a layer
of thickness of a few hundred meters in the atmosphere above the detector,
which accelerates/decelerates the secondary shower particles of opposite
charge, modifying the number of particles with energy exceeding the detector
threshold. These results, for the first time, give a consistent explanation for
the origin of the variation of the electron/positron flux observed for decades

knots of material with [N II]$\lambda 6584$/H$\alpha$ ratios up to 12, and with
radial velocities relative to systemic from -340 km/s up to +390 km/s. We find
evidence of a bipolar ejection event at a velocity $\sim 600$ km/s from the
central star (assumed to be a binary), which occurred about 8000yr ago. The
fast moving material is chemically quite distinct from the lower velocity gas
in the bipolar lobes., and displays very high N abundances. We show that the
fast moving N-rich knots are not photoionised by the central star, and have
constructed detailed shock models for the brightest knot. We find a pre-shock
density $\sim 6$cm$^{-3}$, and a shock velocity $\sim150$ km/s. The shock is
not fully radiative, being only $\sim 600$yr old. This shocked gas is partially
H-burnt, with a helium abundance by mass exceeding that of hydrogen, and is
interacting with partially H-burnt material ejected in an earlier episode of
mass loss. We conclude that the high-velocity material and the bipolar shell
must have originated during the late stages of evolution of a common-envelope
phase in a close binary system.

points with linear dispersion, around which the quasiparticles resemble the
relativistic Dirac Fermions. It can be described by a 4 * 4 massless Dirac
Hamiltonian which can be decomposed into a pair of Weyl points or gaped into an
insulator. Thus, crystal symmetry is critical to guarantee the stable
existence. On the contrary, by breaking crystal symmetry, a DSM may transform
into a Weyl semimetal (WSM) or a topological insulator (TI). Here, by taking
hexagonal LiAuSe as an example, we find that it is a starfruit shaped multiple
nodal chain semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling(SOC). In the
presence of SOC, it is an ideal DSM naturally with the Dirac points locating at
Fermi level exactly, and it would transform into WSM phase by introducing
external Zeeman field or by magnetic doping with rare-earth atom Sm. It could
also transform into TI state by breaking rotational symmetry. Our studies show
that DSM is a critical point for topological phase transition, and the
conclusion can apply to most of the DSM materials, not limited to the hexagonal
material LiAuSe.

disease potentially leading to optic nerve disease in Middle Tennessee.
Methods. We use a retrospective population-based incidence study design
focusing on the population of middle Tennessee and its nearby suburbs (N=3 397
515). The electronic medical records for all patients evaluated or treated at a
large tertiary care hospital and clinics with an initial diagnosis of a disease
either affecting the optic nerve, or potentially associated with optic nerve
disease, between 2007 and 2014 were retrieved and analyzed. Results. 18 291
patients (10 808 F) with 18 779 incidence events were identified with an age
range of 0-101 years from the query of the Vanderbilt BioVU. Estimated
age-adjusted incidence per 100 000 population per year was 198.4/145.1
(glaucoma F/M), 14.4/11.4 (intrinsic optic nerve disease F/M), 10.6/5.8 (optic
nerve edema F/M), 6.1/6.6 (orbital inflammation F/M), and 23.7/6.7 (thyroid
disease F/M). Glaucoma incidence was strongly correlated with age with the
incidence sharply increasing after age 40. Optic nerve edema incidence peaked
in the 25-34 old females. African American population has increased likelihood
of glaucoma, orbital inflammation, and thyroid disease. Conclusions. Mapping
the incidence of pathologies of the optic nerve is essential to the
understanding of the relative likelihood of these conditions and impacts upon
public health. We find incidence of optic nerve diseases strongly varies by
gender, age, and race which have not been previously studied using a unified
framework or within a single metropolitan population

To further investigate the implications of low-redshift, star-forming BCGs, we
perform a systematic search using the 22$\mu$m data (""W4"" band) from the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) on the GMBCG catalog, which contains
55,424 BCGs at $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 0.55$ identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). Our sample consists of 389 BCGs that are bright in W4
(""W4BCGs""), most being brighter than 5 mJy. While some ($\lesssim 20\%$) might
host AGN, most W4BCGs should owe their strong mid-IR emissions to
dust-enshrouded star formation. Their median total IR luminosity ($L_{IR}$) is
$5\times10^{11} L_{\odot}$ (SFR $\sim$50 $M_{\odot}/yr)$, and 27\% of the whole
sample has $L_{IR}>10^{12} L_{\odot}$ (SFR $>$100 $M_{\odot}/yr$). Using ten
W4BCGs that have Chandra X-ray data, we show that seven of them are possibly in
CC clusters. However, in most cases (five out of seven) the mass deposition
rate cannot account for the observed SFR. This casts doubt to the idea that
cooling flows are the cause of the star formation in non-quiescent BCGs.

Consequently, libraries are not easily reusable across systems, and substantial

relating concepts across libraries and conjectured that it would provide a good

simplicity of measuring the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values of
very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars commonly used in the field is exploited
to realize a low cost and lightweight tracking platform suitable for
integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to uncertainty and the
nonlinearity of the system based on RSSI measurements, our tracking and
planning approaches integrate a particle filter for tracking and localizing; a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for dynamic path planning.
This approach allows autonomous navigation of a UAV in a direction of maximum
information gain to locate multiple mobile animals and reduce exploration time;
and, consequently, conserve onboard battery power. We also employ the concept
of a search termination criteria to maximize the number of located animals
within power constraints of the aerial system. We validated our real-time and

estimate determined from MLCS2k2 fitting. The rise time is measured from the
well-observed $B$-band light curve with the first detection at least 1~mag
fainter than the peak magnitude, and the photospheric velocity is measured from
the strong absorption feature of Si~II~$\lambda$6355 at the time of peak

expanding fireball with two assumptions: (a) the optical emission is
approximately that of a blackbody, and (b) the photospheric temperatures of
SNe~Ia are similar to each other at the time of peak brightness. We compare the
precision of the distance residuals inferred using this physically motivated
model against those from the empirical Phillips relation and the MLCS2k2 method

stringent extinction cut to obtain a ""low-v-golden sample"" of 22 SNe, we obtain
significantly reduced scatter in the new relation, better than those of the

set of facial muscle-based action units (AUs) defined by the Facial Action

simultaneous occurrence of pain-related AU combinations, whose automated
detection would be highly beneficial for efficient and practical pain
monitoring. Existing general Automated Facial Expression Recognition (AFER)
systems prove inadequate when applied specifically for detecting pain as they
either focus on detecting individual pain-related AUs but not on combinations

is a challenging task. The popular Kubo-Greenwood model exploits elements from
equilibrium density functional theory (DFT) that allow a detailed treatment of
electron correlations, but its origin is largely phenomenological; traditional
kinetic theories have a more secure foundation but are limited to weak
ion-electron interactions. The objective here is to show how a combination of
the two evolves naturally from an exact short time limit for the generator of
the effective single electron dynamics governing time correlation functions.
This provides a theoretical context for the current DFT-related approach, the
Kubo-Greenwood model, while showing the nature of its corrections. The method
is to calculate the exact short time dynamics in the single electron subspace,
for a given configuration of the ions. This differs from the usual kinetic
theory approach in which an average over the ions is performed as well. In this
way the effective ion-electron interaction is treated exactly and shown to be
determined from DFT. The correlation functions have the random phase
approximation for an inhomogeneous system, but with renormalized ion-electron
and electron-electron potentials. The dynamic structure function, density
response function, and electrical conductivity are calculated as examples. The
static local field corrections in the dielectric function are identified in
this way. The current analysis is limited to semi-classical electrons (quantum
statistical potentials), so important quantum conditions are excluded. However,
a quantization of the kinetic theory is identified for broader application
while awaiting its detailed derivation.

non-magnetizable liquid droplet, against gravity, inside a relatively lighter
ferrofluid -- a system barely considered in ferrohydrodynamics -- is possible,
and exhibits unique interfacial features; the stability of the levitation
trajectory, however, is subject to an appropriate magnetic field modulation. We
explore the shapes and the temporal dynamics of a plane non-magnetizable
droplet levitating inside ferrofluid against gravity due to a spatially
complex, but systematically generated, magnetic field in two dimensions. The
effect of the viscosity ratio, the stability of the levitation path and the
possibility of existence of multiple-stable equilibrium states is investigated.
We find, for certain conditions on the viscosity ratio, that there can be
developments of cusps and singularities at the droplet surface; this phenomenon
we also observe experimentally and compared with the simulations. Our
simulations closely replicate the singular projection on the surface of the
levitating droplet. Finally, we present an dynamical model for the vertical
trajectory of the droplet. This model reveals a condition for the onset of
levitation and the relation for the equilibrium levitation height. The
linearization of the model around the steady state captures that the nature of
the equilibrium point goes under a transition from being a spiral to a node
depending upon the control parameters, which essentially means that the
temporal route to the equilibrium can be either monotonic or undulating. The
analytical model for the droplet trajectory is in close agreement with the
detailed simulations. (See draft for full abstract).

requires understanding and leveraging algorithmic properties. This paper builds
upon the algorithmic insight that bitwidth of operations in DNNs can be reduced
without compromising their classification accuracy. However, to prevent
accuracy loss, the bitwidth varies significantly across DNNs and it may even be
adjusted for each layer. Thus, a fixed-bitwidth accelerator would either offer
limited benefits to accommodate the worst-case bitwidth requirements, or lead
to a degradation in final accuracy. To alleviate these deficiencies, this work
introduces dynamic bit-level fusion/decomposition as a new dimension in the
design of DNN accelerators. We explore this dimension by designing Bit Fusion,
a bit-flexible accelerator, that constitutes an array of bit-level processing
elements that dynamically fuse to match the bitwidth of individual DNN layers.
This flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the
communication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy. We
evaluate the benefits of BitFusion using eight real-world feed-forward and
recurrent DNNs. The proposed microarchitecture is implemented in Verilog and
synthesized in 45 nm technology. Using the synthesis results and cycle accurate
simulation, we compare the benefits of Bit Fusion to two state-of-the-art DNN

magnetic fields. Recent studies show that these swirling motions are ubiquitous
in the solar surface convection and occur in a wide range of temporal and
spatial scales. Their interplay with magnetic fields is poorly characterized,
however. We study the relation between a persistent photospheric vortex flow
and the evolution of a network magnetic element at a supergranular vertex. We
used long-duration sequences of continuum intensity images acquired with Hinode
and the local correlation-tracking method to derive the horizontal photospheric
flows. Supergranular cells are detected as large-scale divergence structures in
the flow maps. At their vertices, and cospatial with network magnetic elements,
the velocity flows converge on a central point. One of these converging flows
is observed as a vortex during the whole 24 h time series. It consists of three
consecutive vortices that appear nearly at the same location. At their core, a
network magnetic element is also detected. Its evolution is strongly correlated
to that of the vortices. The magnetic feature is concentrated and evacuated
when it is caught by the vortices and is weakened and fragmented after the
whirls disappear. This evolutionary behavior supports the picture presented

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks can be effective means to automatically classify aerial
images but is easy to overfit to the training data. It is critical for trained
neural networks to be robust to variations that exist between training and test
environments. To address the overfitting problem in aerial image
classification, we consider the neural network as successive transformations of
an input image into embedded feature representations and ultimately into a
semantic class label, and train neural networks to optimize image
representations in the embedded space in addition to optimizing the final
classification score. We demonstrate that networks trained with this dual
embedding and classification loss outperform networks with classification loss
only. %We also study placing the embedding loss on different network layers. We
also find that moving the embedding loss from commonly-used feature space to
the classifier space, which is the space just before softmax nonlinearization,
leads to the best classification performance for aerial images. Visualizations
of the network's embedded representations reveal that the embedding loss
encourages greater separation between target class clusters for both training
and testing partitions of two aerial image classification benchmark datasets,
MSTAR and AID. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

shielding around the dump. First, we have implemented the detailed BDX
experimental geometry into a FLUKA simulation, in consultation with experts
from the JLab Radiation Control Group. The FLUKA simulation has been compared
directly to our GEANT4 simulations and shown to agree in regions of validity.
The FLUKA interaction package, with a tuned set of biasing weights, is
naturally able to generate reliable particle distributions with very small
probabilities and therefore predict rates at the detector location beyond the
planned shielding around the beam dump. Second, we have developed a plan to
conduct measurements of the muon ux from the Hall-A dump in its current
configuration to validate our simulations.

surface sensitivity of angle resolved photoemission (ARPES). The symmetry in

uniquely determine the local orbital angular momentum (OAM) contribution to the
circular dichroism (CD) in ARPES. The extracted CD signals for the K and K'
valleys are almost identical but their signs, which should be determined by the
valley index, are opposite. In addition, the sign is found to be the same for
the two spin-split bands, indicating that it is independent of spin state.
These observed CD behaviors are what are expected from Berry curvature of a
monolayer of WSe2. In order to see if CD-ARPES is indeed representative of
hidden Berry curvature within a layer, we use tight binding analysis as well as
density functional calculation to calculate the Berry curvature and local OAM
of a monolayer WSe2. We find that measured CD-ARPES is approximately
proportional to the calculated Berry curvature as well as local OAM, further
supporting our interpretation.

Observatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT) and Solar Dynamics

level by means of histogram equalization. We then develop a novel automated
method to identify CHs from these homogenized maps by determining the intensity
threshold of CH regions separately for each synoptic map. This is done by
identifying the best location and size of an image segment, which optimally
contains portions of coronal holes and the surrounding quiet Sun allowing us to
detect the momentary intensity threshold. Our method is thus able to adjust
itself to the changing scale size of coronal holes and to temporally varying
intensities. To make full use of the information in the three wavelengths we
construct, a composite CH distribution, which is more robust than distributions
based on one wavelength. Using the composite CH dataset we discuss the temporal

mean-field dynamo models of the 0.3M star rotating with the period of 10 days.
In exploring several dynamo scenarios which are stemming from the
cross-helicity generation effect, we found that the cross-helicity provide the
natural generation mechanisms for the large-scale scale axisym- metric and
non-axisymmetric magnetic field. Therefore the rotating stars with convective
envelope can produce the large-scale magnetic field generated solely due to the
turbulent cross-helicity effect (we call it {\gamma} 2 -dynamo). Using
mean-field models we compare properties of the large-scale magnetic field
organization that stems from dynamo mechanisms based on the kinetic (associated
with the {\alpha} 2 dynamos) and cross-helicity. For the fully convective
stars, both generation mechanisms can maintain large-scale dynamos even for the
solid body rotation law inside the star. The non-axisymmetric magnetic
configurations become preferable when the cross-helicity and the
{\alpha}-effect operate independently of each other. This corresponds to
situations of the purely {\gamma} 2 or {\alpha} 2 dynamos. Combination of these
scenarios, i.e., the {\gamma} 2 {\alpha} 2 dynamo can generate preferably
axisymmetric, a dipole-like magnetic field of strength several kGs. Thus we
found a new dynamo scenario which is able to generate the axisymmetric magnetic
field even in the case of the solid body rotation of the star. We discuss the
possible applications of our findings to stellar observations.

  Signal Recovery","30 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To strike a balance between energy efficiency and data quality control, this
paper proposes a sensor censoring scheme for distributed sparse signal recovery
via compressive-sensing based wireless sensor networks. In the proposed
approach, each sensor node employs a sparse sensing vector with known support
for data compression, meanwhile enabling making local inference about the
unknown support of the sparse signal vector of interest. This naturally leads
to a ternary censoring protocol, whereby each sensor (i) directly transmits the
real-valued compressed data if the sensing vector support is detected to be
overlapped with the signal support, (ii) sends a one-bit hard decision if empty
support overlap is inferred, (iii) keeps silent if the measurement is judged to
be uninformative. Our design then aims at minimizing the error probability that
empty support overlap is decided but otherwise is true, subject to the
constraints on a tolerable false-alarm probability that non-empty support
overlap is decided but otherwise is true, and a target censoring rate. We
derive a closed-form formula of the optimal censoring rule; a low complexity
implementation using bi-section search is also developed. In addition, the
average communication cost is analyzed. To aid global signal reconstruction
under the proposed censoring framework, we propose a modified l_1-minimization
based algorithm, which exploits certain sparse nature of the hard decision
vector received at the fusion center. Analytic performance guarantees,
characterized in terms of the restricted isometry property, are also derived.
Computer simulations are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed
scheme.

permanent magnet in a synchronous machine are discussed. The optimization is
constrained by a partial differential equation to describe the electromagnetic
behavior of the machine. The need for a robust optimization procedure
originates from the fact that optimization parameters have deviations. The
first approach, i.e., \textcolor{red}{worst-case} optimization, makes use of
local sensitivities. The second approach takes into account expectation values
and standard deviations. The latter are associated with global sensitivities.
The geometry parametrization is elegantly handled thanks to the introduction of
an affine decomposition. Since the stochastic quantities are determined by
tools from uncertainty quantification (UQ) and thus require a lot of finite
element evaluations, model order reduction is used in order to increase the
efficiency of the procedure. It is shown that both approaches are equivalent if
a linearization is carried out. \textcolor{blue}{This finding is supported by
the application on an electric machine. The optimization algorithms used are
sequential quadratic programming, particle swarm optimization and genetic
algorithm}. While both formulations reduce the size of the magnets, the UQ
based optimization approach is less pessimistic with respect to deviations and
yields smaller magnets.

is a key prebiotic molecule, but, so far, only the $E$ isomer has been detected
toward the massive star-forming region. Sagittarius B2(N) using transitions in
the radio wavelength domain. With the aim of detecting HNCHCN in Sun-like-star
forming regions, the laboratory investigation of its rotational spectrum has
been extended to the millimeter-/submillimeter-wave (mm-/submm-) spectral
window in which several unbiased spectral surveys have been already carried
out. High-resolution laboratory measurements of the rotational spectrum of
C-cyanomethanimine were carried out in the 100-420 GHz range using a
frequency-modulation absorption spectrometer. We then searched for the
C-cyanomethanimine spectral features in the mm-wave range using the
high-sensitivity and unbiased spectral surveys obtained with the IRAM 30-m
antenna in the ASAI context, the earliest stages of star formation from
starless to evolved Class I objects being sampled. For both the $Z$ and $E$
isomers, the spectroscopic work has led to an improved and extended knowledge
of the spectroscopic parameters, thus providing accurate predictions of the
rotational signatures up to $\sim$700 GHz. So far, no C-cyanomethanimine
emission has been detected toward the ASAI targets, and upper limits of the
column density of $\sim$ 10$^{11}$--10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ could only be derived.
Consequently, the C-cyanomethanimine abundances have to be less than a few
10$^{-10}$ for starless and hot-corinos. A less stringent constraint, $\leq$
10$^{-9}$, is obtained for shocks sites. The combination of the upper limits of
the abundances of C-cyanomethanimine together with accurate laboratory
frequencies up to $\sim$ 700 GHz poses the basis for future higher sensitivity
searches around Sun-like-star forming regions.

behaviors of the imaginary part of the quasinormal mode frequencies along the
isobaric or isothermal processes. For the first issue, our result shows that,
at low fixed temperature or pressure, the phase transition can be probed by the
sign change of slope. While increasing the temperature or pressure to some
certain values near the critical point, there will appear the deflection point,
which indicates that such method may not be appropriate to test the phase
transition. In particular, the behavior of the quasinormal mode frequencies for
the small and large black holes tend to the same at the critical point. For the
second issue, it is shown that the non-monotonic behavior is observed only when
the small/large black hole phase transition occurs. Therefore, this property
can provide us with an additional method to probe the phase transition through
the quasinormal modes.

systems, the critical behavior is manifested in the steady states rather than
in the ground states as in quantum critical models of closed systems. To give
the generalization we need to establish what is meant by adiabaticity in open

embedding from a global context. The testing phase constitutes computing the
average word embedding of the test post, and finding the similarity of this

the most-similar hashtag are extracted, and all the hashtags that appear in

with LTE conditions and moderate line opacities have been corrected via a
Population Diagram method or theoretical relative intensity ratios of the

ratios, without any systematic difference between amine and nitrile bearing
species as previously found in other protostellar sources. The weighted average
of the 14N/15N isotopic ratio is 270 +/- 30. This 14N/15N value is remarkably
consistent with the [250-350] range measured for the local galactic ratio but
significantly differs from the ratio measured in comets (around 140).
High-angular resolution observations are needed to examine whether this
discrepancy is maintained at smaller scales. In addition, using the CN, HCN and

predicted, giving closer agreement with Stokes' result for a falling hard
sphere. Increasing the drop size, a transition between these two extremes is
found. This is due to surfactants present in the system, and previous work has
led to the stagnant-cap model. We present here an alternative approach which we
call the continuous-interface model. In contrast to the stagnant-cap model, we
do not consider a surfactant advection-diffusion equation at the interface.
Taking instead the normal and tangential interfacial stresses into account, we
solve the Stokes equation analytically for the falling drop with varying
interfacial tension. Some of the solutions thus obtained, e.g. the hovering
drop, violate conservation ofenergy unless energy is provided directly to the
interface. Considering the energy budget of the drop, we show that the terminal
velocity is bounded by the Stokes and the Hadamard-Rybczynski results. The
continuous-interface model is then obtained from the force balance for
surfactants at the interface. The resulting expressions gives the transition
between the two extremes, and also predicts that the critical radius, below
which drops fall like hard spheres, is proportional to the interfacial
surfactant concentration. By analysing experimental results from the
literature, we confirm this prediction, thus providing strong arguments for the
validity of the proposed model.

bursts of photospheric origin (2/3 of all bursts, divided into 3 clusters) and
bursts of synchrotron origin (1/3 of all bursts, divided into 2 clusters). For

use from origin to destination knowing toll rates and having, in addition, more
accurate traffic data. Toll setters often also face constraints on price
experimentation which means less opportunity for price revision. Motivated by
this we propose a novel robust pricing methodology for fixing prices where we
take non-adversarial view of nature different from the existing robust

an exact algorithm based on a mixed-integer programming formulation and a
heuristic based on two-point support distribution. We further extend our

divided into layers, such that every edge targeting a layer, excluding the
first one, starts in the prior layer. A feed-forward system is a dynamical
system that respects the structure of a feed-forward network. The synchrony
subspaces for a network, are the subspaces defined by equalities of some cells
coordinates, that are flow-invariant by all the network systems. The
restriction of each network system to each synchrony subspace is a system
associated with a smaller network, which may be, or not, a feed-forward
network. The original network is then said to be a lift of the smaller network.
We show that a feed-forward lift of a feed-forward network is given by the
composition of two types of lifts: lifts that create new layers and lifts
inside a layer. Furthermore, we address the lifting bifurcation problem on
feed-forward systems. More precisely, the comparison of the possible
codimension-one local steady-state bifurcations of a feed-forward system and
those of the corresponding lifts is considered. We show that for most of the
feed-forward lifts, the increase of the center subspace is a sufficient
condition for the existence of additional bifurcating branches of solutions,
which are not lifted from the restricted system. However, when the bifurcation
condition is associated with the internal dynamics and the lifts occurs inside
an intermediate layer, we prove that the existence of bifurcating branches of
solutions that are not lifted from the restricted system does depend
generically on the particular feed-forward system.

alloys of Co$_2$YZ (Y = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, In, Sn,
Sb) were studied in the temperature range 4.2--900 K and in magnetic fields of
up to 100 kOe. It was found that varying Y in affects strongly the electric
resistivity and its temperature dependence $\rho(T)$, while this effect is not
observed upon changing Z. When Y is varied, extrema (maximum or minimum) are
observed in $\rho(T)$ near the Curie temperature $T_C$. At $T < T_C$, the
$\rho(T)$ behavior can be ascribed to a change in electronic energy spectrum
near the Fermi level. The coefficients of the normal and anomalous Hall effect
were determined. It was shown that the latter coefficient, $R_S$, is related to
the residual resistivity $\rho_0$ by a power law $R_S \sim \rho_0^k/M_S$ with
$M_S$ the spontaneous magnetization. The exponent $k$ was found to be 1.8 for
Co$_2$FeZ alloys, which is typical for asymmetric scattering mechanisms, and
2.9 for Co$_2$YAl alloys, which indicates an additional contribution to the
anomalous Hall effect. The temperature dependence of resistivity at low
temperatures is analyzed and discussed in the framework of the two-magnon
scattering theory.

cylinder is investigated numerically. The cylinder is free to oscillate in the
direction transverse to the incoming flow. The cylinder is attached to a magnet
that can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire. The magnet
and the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. When the
cylinder undergoes VIV, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the
coil, which is connected to a resistive load. By Lenz's law, induced current in
the coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. Effectively, the electrical
generator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying
damping coefficient. For the initial investigation reported here, the Reynolds
number is restricted to Re < 200, so that the flow is laminar and
two-dimensional (2D). The incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations are solved
using an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. The effects of
the electromagnetic (EM) damping constant xi_m, coil dimensions (radius a,
length L), and mass ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. It
is found that there is an optimal value of xi_m (xi_opt) at which maximum
electrical power is generated. As the radius or length of the coil is
increased, the value of xi_opt is observed to increase. Although the maximum
average power remains the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a
more robust system in the sense that a relatively large amount of power can be
extracted when xi_m is far from xi_opt, unlike the constant damping ratio case.
The average power output is also a function of Reynolds number, primarily
through the increased maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased
Reynolds number at least within the laminar range, although the general
qualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high Reynolds number VIV.

independency with high efficiency, sustainability and cheap production. In this
context, technologies beyond Li-ion are receiving increasing attention, among
which the development of micro solid oxide fuel cells ({\mu}SOFC) stands out.
In particular, {\mu}SOFC provides a high energy density, high efficiency and
opens the possibility to the use of different fuels, such as hydrocarbons. Yet,
its high operating temperature has typically hindered its application as
miniaturized portable device. Recent advances have however set a completely new
range of lower operating temperatures, i.e. 350-450C, as compared to the
typical >900C needed for classical bulk SOFC systems. In this work, a
comprehensive review of the status of the technology is presented. The main
achievements, as well as the most important challenges still pending are
discussed, regarding (i.) the cell design and microfabrication, and (ii.) the

  Systems","7 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Embedded systems play a crucial role in fueling the growth of the
Internet-of-Things (IoT) in application domains such as healthcare, home
automation, transportation, etc. However, their increasingly network-connected
nature, coupled with their ability to access potentially sensitive/confidential
information, has given rise to many security and privacy concerns. An
additional challenge is the growing number of counterfeit components in these
devices, resulting in serious reliability and financial implications.
Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive to
help address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as
they require minimal or no additional hardware for their operation. However,
current memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for
constructing the PUF, which has several disadvantages including making them
vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, we propose the design of a new
memory-based combination PUF that intelligently combines two memory
technologies, SRAM and DRAM, to overcome these shortcomings. The proposed
combination PUF exhibits high entropy, supports a large number of
challenge-response pairs, and is intrinsically reconfigurable. We have
implemented the proposed combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA board and
several off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Experimental results demonstrate
substantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability
to resist various attacks. Extensive authentication tests across a wide
temperature range (20 - 60 deg. Celsius) and accelerated aging (12 months)
demonstrate the robustness of the proposed design, which achieves a 100%
true-positive rate and 0% false-positive rate for authentication across these
parameter ranges.

we show that the geometry of a quasi-median graph essentially reduces to the
combinatorics of its hyperplanes. In the second part, we exploit the specific
structure of the hyperplanes to state combination results. The main idea is
that if a group acts in a suitable way on a quasi-median graph so that
clique-stabilisers satisfy some non-positively curved property $\mathcal{P}$,
then the whole group must satisfy $\mathcal{P}$ as well. The properties we are

Guba and Sapir's diagram products, some wreath products, and some graphs of
groups. Graph products are our most natural examples, where the link between
the group and its quasi-median graph is particularly strong and explicit; in

significant influence on the generalization performance of DCNNs. 2) DCNNs can
generalize surprisingly well to unseen illumination conditions and large
sampling gaps in the pose variation. 3) Using the presented methodology we
reveal that the VGG-16 architecture outperforms the AlexNet architecture at
face recognition tasks because it can much better generalize to unseen face
poses, although it has significantly more parameters. 4) We uncover a main
limitation of current DCNN architectures, which is the difficulty to generalize

consider the situation when the system response can be modeled by two nested

propose sequential designs to improve the accuracy of the nested code's

selection criterion is proposed to allow the modeler to choose the code to

proposed for this particular configuration in order to quickly evaluate the

constriction, within the cross-section of a rectangular channel could be used
as a robust passive sorting device in two-phase fluid flows. Single air bubbles
carried within silicone oil are generally transported on one side of the rail.
However, for flow rates marginally larger than a critical value, a narrow band
of bubble sizes can propagate (stably) over the rail, while bubbles of other
sizes segregate to the side of the rail. The width of this band of bubble sizes
increases with flow rate and the size of the most stable bubble can be tuned by
varying the rail width. We present a complementary theoretical analysis based
on a depth-averaged theory, which is in qualitative agreement with the
experiments. The theoretical study reveals that the mechanism relies on a
non-trivial interaction between capillary and viscous forces that is fully
dynamic, rather than being a simple modification of capillary static solutions.

  Stokes finite element methods",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent works showed that pressure-robust modifications of mixed finite
element methods for the Stokes equations outperform their standard versions in
many cases. This is achieved by divergence-free reconstruction operators and
results in pressure independent velocity error estimates which are robust with
respect to small viscosities. In this paper we develop a posteriori error
control which reflects this robustness.
  The main difficulty lies in the volume contribution of the standard
residual-based approach that includes the $L^2$-norm of the right-hand side.
However, the velocity is only steered by the divergence-free part of this
source term. An efficient error estimator must approximate this divergence-free
part in a proper manner, otherwise it can be dominated by the pressure error.
  To overcome this difficulty a novel approach is suggested that uses arguments
from the stream function and vorticity formulation of the Navier--Stokes
equations. The novel error estimators only take the $\mathrm{curl}$ of the
right-hand side into account and so lead to provably reliable, efficient and
pressure-independent upper bounds in case of a pressure-robust method in
particular in pressure-dominant situations. This is also confirmed by some
numerical examples with the novel pressure-robust modifications of the
Taylor--Hood and mini finite element methods.

humans, differentiating them from current deep learning systems. However, other
branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards
autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and
natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide
exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep
learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made
great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human
learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human
capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data,
leveraging compositional representations and priors like intuitive physics and
psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL
systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap,
that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al.
These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning.
They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future.
Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific
objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of
large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended
repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value,
and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and
social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes
are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a
progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are
explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and
timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through
bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time,
and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of
Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et

investigate the HEA in the deformed, recovered, partially recrystallized, and
fully recrystallized states. Detailed microstructure and texture analysis was
performed by electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron
microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties were evaluated
using uniaxial tensile testing. A specific focus of this investigation was put
on studying the influence of deformation and annealing twinning on the material
behavior. It was substantiated that during cold rolling deformation, twinning
facilitates the transition from the Cu-type to the Brass-type texture, whereas
annealing-twinning leads to a strong modification of the texture formed during
recrystallization. The formation of specific twin orientations and the
randomization of the recrystallization texture were proven by experiments as
well as by cellular automaton simulations. During tension of the cold-rolled
and annealed material high work-hardenability was observed. We attribute this
behavior primarily to the dominance of planar dislocation slip and reduced
tendency for dynamic recovery, since deformation twinning was observed to
activate only in the non-recrystallized grains and thus, contributed minimally
to the overall plasticity. The correlation between deformation/annealing
twinning and the material behavior was discussed in detail.

in certain special cases, the numerical schemes that come from the
discretization of HJBQVIs take the form of complicated nonlinear matrix
equations also known as Bellman problems. We prove that a policy iteration
algorithm can be used to compute their solutions. In order to do so, we employ
the theory of weakly chained diagonally dominant (w.c.d.d.) matrices. As a
byproduct of our analysis, we obtain some new results regarding a particular
family of Markov decision processes which can be thought of as impulse control
problems on a discrete state space and the relationship between w.c.d.d.

directly use the seminal result of Barles and Souganidis (concerning the
convergence of monotone, stable, and consistent numerical schemes to the

issue by extending the work of Barles and Souganidis to nonlocal PDEs in a
manner general enough to apply to HJBQVIs. We apply our schemes to compute the
solutions of various classical problems from finance concerning optimal control

importance. There exist a handful of research work that focus on feature
extraction to obtain gender specific information from facial images. However,
analyzing different facial regions and their fusion help in deciding the gender
of a person from facial images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
identify gender from frontal facial images that is robust to background,
illumination, intensity, and facial expression. In our framework, first the
frontal face image is divided into a number of distinct regions based on facial
landmark points that are obtained by the Chehra model proposed by Asthana et
al. The model provides 49 facial landmark points covering different regions of
the face, e.g. forehead, left eye, right eye, lips. Next, a face image is
segmented into facial regions using landmark points and features are extracted
from each region. The Compass LBP feature, a variant of LBP feature, has been
used in our framework to obtain discriminative gender-specific information.
Following this, a Support Vector Machine based classifier has been used to
compute the probability scores from each facial region. Finally, the
classification scores obtained from individual regions are combined with a
genetic algorithm based learning to improve the overall classification
accuracy. The experiments have been performed on popular face image datasets
such as Adience, cFERET (color FERET), LFW and two sketch datasets, namely CUFS
and CUFSF. Through experiments, we have observed that, the proposed method
outperforms existing approaches.

not represent any underlying discrete structure; invalid sequences hinder the
utility of such models. As a step towards solving this problem, we propose to
learn a deep recurrent validator model, which can estimate whether a partial
sequence can function as the beginning of a full, valid sequence. This
validator provides insight as to how individual sequence elements influence the
validity of the overall sequence, and can be used to constrain sequence based
models to generate valid sequences -- and thus faithfully model discrete
objects. Our approach is inspired by reinforcement learning, where an oracle

system, posing serious challenges for perturbative approaches starting from
uncorrelated reference states. The last decade has witnessed considerable
progress in the accurate treatment of pairing correlations, one of the major
components in medium-sized nuclei, reaching accuracies below the 1% level of
the correlation energy.
  Purpose: Development of a quantum many-body method for pairing correlations
that is (a) competitive in the 1% error range, and (b) can be systematically
improved with a fast (exponential) convergence rate.
  Method: The present paper capitalizes upon ideas from Richardson-Gaudin
integrability. The proposed method is a two-step approach. The first step
consists of the optimization of a Richardson-Gaudin ground state as variational
trial state. At the second step, the complete set of excited states on top of
this Richardson-Gaudin ground state is used as an optimal basis for a
Configuration Interaction method in an increasingly large effective Hilbert
space.
  Results: The performance of the variational Richardson-Gaudin (varRG) and
Richardson-Gaudin Configuration Interaction (RGCI) method is benchmarked
against exact results using an effective $G$-matrix interaction for the Sn
region. The varRG already reaches accuracies around the 1% level of the
correlation energies, and the RGCI step sees an additional improvement scaling
exponentially with the size of the effective Hilbert space.
  Conclusions: The Richardson-Gaudin models of integrability provide an
optimized complete basis set for pairing correlations.

testing and program analysis. There are several symbolic execution tools
available off-the-shelf, and we need a practical benchmark approach to learn
their capabilities. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach to
benchmark symbolic execution tools in a fine-grained and efficient manner. In
particular, our approach evaluates the performance of such tools against the
known challenges faced by general symbolic execution techniques, such as
floating-point numbers and symbolic memories. To this end, we first survey
related papers and systematize the challenges of symbolic execution. We extract
12 distinct challenges from the literature and categorize them into two
categories: symbolic-reasoning challenges and path-explosion challenges. Then,
we develop a dataset of logic bombs and a framework to benchmark symbolic
execution tools automatically. For each challenge, our dataset contains several
logic bombs, each of which is guarded by a specific challenging problem. If a
symbolic execution tool can find test cases to trigger logic bombs, it
indicates that the tool can handle the corresponding problems. We have
conducted real-world experiments with three popular symbolic execution tools:
KLEE, Angr, and Triton. Experimental results show that our approach can reveal
their capabilities and limitations in handling particular issues accurately and
efficiently. The benchmark process generally takes only dozens of minutes to
evaluate a tool. We release our dataset on GitHub as open source, with an aim
to better facilitate the community to conduct future work on benchmarking
symbolic execution tools.

the electron is transferred to a diffuse Rydberg like $\sigma$* orbital apart
from the proton migration. This picture means the electron and the proton are
not move together and its dynamics are different in principle. Here, we have
applied the picosecond time-resolved near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR)

and monitored the electron transfer and proton motion independently. The
electron transfer monitored by the NIR transition rises within 3 ps while the
overall H transfer detected by the IR absorption of NH vibration appears with
the lifetime of $\approx$20 ps. It clearly proves that the electron motion and
proton migration are decoupled. Such the difference of the time-evolutions

phenomenon can significantly lower the activation barrier of dynamical process
that depends strongly on charge state, such as carbon vacancy diffusion in
4H-SiC. With inclusion of such transition state redox, the activation barrier
varies continuously with Fermi level, in contrast to the step-line feature

Specifically, we study the dynamic spin structure factor $S(q,\omega)$, which
can be probed directly by inelastic neutron scattering experiments and, in the
limit of small $\omega$, in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments
through the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$. Our work combines three
complementary methods: exact diagonalization, matrix-product-state algorithms,
and stochastic analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo results in
imaginary time. Unlike the uniform system, whose low-energy excitations at low
$T$ are restricted to $q$ close to $0$ and $\pi$, our study reveals a
continuous narrow band of low-energy excitations in $S(q,\omega)$, extending
throughout the Brillouin zone. Close to $q=\pi$, the scaling properties of
these excitations are well captured by the RS theory, but we also see
disagreements with some aspects of the predicted $q$-dependence further away
from $q=\pi$. Furthermore we find spin diffusion effects close to $q=0$ that
are not contained within the RS theory but give non-negligible contributions to
the mean $1/T_1$. To compare with NMR experiments, we consider the distribution
of the local $1/T_1$ values, which is broad, approximately described by a
stretched exponential. The mean value first decreases with $T$, but starts to
increase and diverge below a crossover temperature. Although a similar
divergent behavior has been found for the static uniform susceptibility, this
divergent behavior of $1/T_1$ has never been seen in experiments. Our results
show that the divergence of the mean $1/T_1$ is due to rare events in the
disordered chains and is concealed in experiments, where the typical $1/T_1$

  Inhomogeneities Estimated by Orthogonal Primary Functions","27 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image segmentation is still an open problem especially when intensities of
the interested objects are overlapped due to the presence of intensity
inhomogeneity (also known as bias field). To segment images with intensity
inhomogeneities, a bias correction embedded level set model is proposed where
Inhomogeneities are Estimated by Orthogonal Primary Functions (IEOPF). In the
proposed model, the smoothly varying bias is estimated by a linear combination
of a given set of orthogonal primary functions. An inhomogeneous intensity
clustering energy is then defined and membership functions of the clusters
described by the level set function are introduced to rewrite the energy as a
data term of the proposed model. Similar to popular level set methods, a
regularization term and an arc length term are also included to regularize and
smooth the level set function, respectively. The proposed model is then
extended to multichannel and multiphase patterns to segment colourful images
and images with multiple objects, respectively. It has been extensively tested
on both synthetic and real images that are widely used in the literature and
public BrainWeb and IBSR datasets. Experimental results and comparison with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that advantages of the proposed model in
terms of bias correction and segmentation accuracy.

graphene dramatically limits tunability of graphene-based optoelectronic
devices, such as tunable absorbers or switches. In this paper, we develop and
use a simple circuit model to understand absorption in graphene sheets. In
particular, we show that light interacts weakly also with very high-mobility
graphene sheets and propose systematic design means to overcome these problems.
The results have allowed us to demonstrate in the terahertz band that perfect
absorption with excellent electrical tunability can be achieved within a wide
span of mobility values which almost covers the whole range of ever reported
room-temperature mobilities. Remarkably, concentrating on the most practical
low-mobility graphene devices, we exemplify our theory with two cases:
frequency-tunable and switchable absorbers with near 100% modulation
efficiencies. Our work provides systematic and instructive insights into the
design of highly tunable absorbers, without restrictions on graphene mobility.
The design strategy and the developed analytical model can, in principle, be
generalized to other wavelength regions from microwave to mid-infrared range,
and other two-dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) and black phosphorus.

(switch) Markov chains on graphic degree sequences. Several results were proved
on rapidly mixing Markov chains on regular simple, on regular directed, on
half-regular directed and on half-regular bipartite degree sequences. In this
paper, the main result is the following: Let $U$ and $V$ be disjoint finite
sets, and let $0 < c_1 \le c_2 < |U|$ and $0 < d_1 \le d_2 < |V|$ be integers.
Furthermore, assume that the bipartite degree sequence on $U \cup V$ satisfies
$c_1 \le d(v) \le c_2\ : \ \forall v\in V$ and $d_1 \le d(u) \le d_2 \ : \
\forall u\in U$. Finally assume that $(c_2-c_1 -1)(d_2 -d_1 -1) < 1 + \max
\{c_1(|V| -d_2), d_1(|V|- c_2) \}$. Then the swap Markov chain on this
bipartite degree sequence is rapidly mixing. The technique applies on directed
degree sequences as well, with very similar parameter values.
  These results are germane to the recent results of Greenhill and Sfragara
about fast mixing MCMC processes on simple and directed degree sequences, where
the maximum degrees are $O(\sqrt{\# \mbox{ of edges}})$. The results are
somewhat comparable on directed degree sequences: while the GS results are
better applicable for degree sequences developed under some scale-free random
process, our new results are better fitted to degree sequences developed under
the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'enyi model. For example our results cover all regular
degree sequences, the GS model is not applicable when the average degree is $ >
n/16.$

physical science, and there has been a gap between state-of-the-art theoretical
convergence analyses and the corresponding efficient retrieval methods.
Firstly, these analyses all assume that the sensing vectors and the iterative
updates are independent, which only fits the ideal model with infinite
measurements but not the reality, where data are limited and have to be reused.
Secondly, the empirical results of some efficient methods, such as the
randomized Kaczmarz method, show linear convergence, which is beyond existing
theoretical explanations considering its randomness and reuse of data. In this
work, we study for the first time, without the independence assumption, the
convergence behavior of the randomized Kaczmarz method for phase retrieval.
Specifically, beginning from taking expectation of the squared estimation error
with respect to the index of measurement by fixing the sensing vector and the
error in the previous step, we discard the independence assumption, rigorously
derive the upper and lower bounds of the reduction of the mean squared error,
and prove the linear convergence. This work fills the gap between a fast
converging algorithm and its theoretical understanding. The proposed
methodology may contribute to the study of other iterative algorithms for phase
retrieval and other problems in the broad area of signal processing and machine
learning.

quantum fields. However, limits on its conservation from the Kaon system look
indeed imposing. In this work we will show that neutrino oscillation
experiments can improve this limit by several orders of magnitude and therefore
are an ideal tool to explore the foundations of our approach to Nature.
  Strictly speaking testing CPT violation would require an explicit model for
how CPT is broken and its effects on physics. Instead, what is presented in
this paper is a test of one of the predictions of CPT conservation, i.e., the
same mass and mixing parameters in neutrinos and antineutrinos. In order to do
that we calculate the current CPT bound on all the neutrino mixing parameters
and study the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such an observable.
  After deriving the most updated bound on CPT from neutrino oscillation data,
we show that, if the recent T2K results turn out to be the true values of
neutrino and antineutrino oscillations, DUNE would measure the fallout of CPT
conservation at more than 3$\sigma$. Then, we study the sensitivity of the
experiment to measure CPT invariance in general, finding that DUNE will be able
to improve the current bounds on $\Delta(\Delta m^2_{31})$ by at least one
order of magnitude. We also study the sensitivity to the other oscillation
parameters. Finally we show that, if CPT is violated in nature, combining
neutrino with antineutrino data in oscillation analysis will produce imposter

$\Sigma$ is a sequence of distinct words $w_1,w_2,\dots,w_\ell$ from $\Sigma^n$
such that any two consecutive words differ in at most $c$ coordinates, for some
fixed constant $c>0$. In this paper we are interested in the read and write
complexity of quasi-Gray codes in the bit-probe model, where we measure the
number of symbols read and written in order to transform any word $w_i$ into
its successor $w_{i+1}$.
  We present construction of quasi-Gray codes of dimension $n$ and length $3^n$
over the ternary alphabet $\{0,1,2\}$ with worst-case read complexity $O(\log
n)$ and write complexity $2$. This generalizes to arbitrary odd-size alphabets.
For the binary alphabet, we present quasi-Gray codes of dimension $n$ and
length at least $2^n - 20n$ with worst-case read complexity $6+\log n$ and
write complexity $2$. This complements a recent result by Raskin [Raskin '17]
who shows that any quasi-Gray code over binary alphabet of length $2^n$ has
read complexity $\Omega(n)$.
  Our results significantly improve on previously known constructions and for
the odd-size alphabets we break the $\Omega(n)$ worst-case barrier for
space-optimal (non-redundant) quasi-Gray codes with constant number of writes.
We obtain our results via a novel application of algebraic tools together with
the principles of catalytic computation [Buhrman et al. '14, Ben-Or and Cleve

evaluate the causal architecture of the system by quantifying causal emergence.
Causal emergence is an information-theoretic metric that quantifies emergence
or reduction between microscopic and macroscopic behaviors of a system by
evaluating effective information at each spatiotemporal scale. We find that
there is a spatiotemporal scale at which effective information peaks in the
cardiac system with rotors. There is a positive correlation between the number
of rotors and causal emergence up to the scale of peak causation. In
conclusion, one can coarse-grain the cardiac system with rotors to identify a
macroscopic scale at which the causal power reaches the maximum. This scale of
peak causation should correspond to that of the AF driver, where networks of
cardiomyocytes serve as the causal units. Those causal units, if identified,
can be reasonable therapeutic targets of clinical intervention to cure AF.

random data and unreliable components. It thus is crucial to have both
quantitative and qualitative analysis of the probabilities of system
properties. Such analysis can be conducted by constructing a formal model of
the system under verification and using Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC).
However, this method is infeasible for large systems, due to the state space
explosion. In this article, we demonstrate the successful use of Statistical
Model Checking (SMC) to carry out such analysis directly from large SystemC
models and allow designers to express a wide range of useful properties. The
first contribution of this work is a framework to verify properties expressed
in Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL) for SystemC models with both timed and
probabilistic characteristics. Second, the framework allows users to expose a
rich set of user-code primitives as atomic propositions in BLTL. Moreover,
users can define their own fine-grained time resolution rather than the
boundary of clock cycles in the SystemC simulation. The third contribution is
an implementation of a statistical model checker. It contains an automatic
monitor generation for producing execution traces of the
model-under-verification (MUV), the mechanism for automatically instrumenting
the MUV, and the interaction with statistical model checking algorithms.

Traditional information measures are grounded on the assumption that the

statistical mechanics aiming to take microphysical codependence into account in
entropy quantification. By taking them into consideration when formulating

macroscale information from microscale codependence among microphysics. In
order to isolate the information emergence coming solely from the nonlinearly

Therefore, to explore the horizon region, in addition to the classical geodesic
equations, one needs to use equation of quantum particles. Applying physical

existence of the exponentially decay/enhanced solutions (with the complex

conformally-related to the standard model via a conformal transformation,
merely a function of the number of fermionic particles dominating the energy
density associated with the ground state of the physical system. Doing so
resolves major puzzles afflicting the standard models of particle physics and
cosmology, clearly indicating these to be artifacts stemming from universally
employing the system of units selected here and now. In addition to the three
known fundamental interactions mediated by gauge bosons, a scalar-tensor
interaction is also accommodated by the theory; its inertial and gravitational
sectors are characterized by whether contributions to the Weyl tensor vanish or
are finite, respectively. In this approach both inertia and gravity are viewed
as collective phenomena, with characteristic gravitational Planck scale devoid
of fundamental meaning; consequently, mass hierarchy and Higgs mass instability
concerns are avoided altogether. Only standard model particles gravitate; dark
matter and dark energy have an inertial origin, and since the Higgs field does
not interact with photons it is an ideal candidate for explaining the dark
sector of cosmology. On cosmological scales the dynamical vacuum-like Higgs
self-coupling accounts for dark energy, and its observed proximity at present
to the energy density of nonrelativistic matter is merely a consistency
requirement. Spatially varying vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field
could likely account for the apparent cold dark matter on both galactic and

resulting of the coexistence between superconductivity and magnetism. According
to this study the values and shape of the critical magnetic fields were
dramatically reduced in a similar form as in other known reentrant
superconductors.

intelligence, three basic modules: objective, agent, and perception are
proposed for development. The objective module would ensure that the system
acts in humanity's interest, not against it. It would have two components: a
network of machine learning agents to address the problem of value alignment
and a distributed ledger to propose a mechanism to mitigate the existential
threat. The agent module would further develop the Dyna concept and benefit
from a treatise in sociology to build the missing link of artificial general
intelligence - a world simulator. The perception module would estimate the
state of the world and benefit from existing machine learning algorithms
enhanced by a new paradigm in hardware design - a quantum computer. This paper
describes a way in which such a system could be built, analyzing the current
state of the art and providing alternative directions for research rather than
concrete, industry-ready solutions.

but they face important difficulties when mapping research for societal
problems possibly because they they are derived only from scientific documents

how ontologies can be used in science mapping, thus enriching current
algorithmic techniques with systematic domain expert knowledge. This study
introduces the methodology behind the construction of an ontology and tests
potential uses in science mapping. We use obesity as a topic of case study.

stretchable millimeter wave metalens with a tunable focal distance.
Computational inverse-design method is used to design a flat metalens made of
disconnected building polymer blocks with complex shapes, as opposed to
conventional monolithic lenses. Proposed metalens provides better performance
than a conventional Fresnel lens, using lesser amount of material and enabling
larger focal distance tunability. The metalens is fabricated using a commercial
3D-printer and attached to a stretchable platform. Measurements and simulations
show that focal distance can be tuned by a factor of 4 with a stretching factor
of only 75%, a nearly diffraction-limited focal spot, and with a 70% focusing
efficiency. The proposed platform can be extended for design and fabrication of
multiple electromagnetic devices working from visible to microwave radiation
depending on scaling of the devices.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel deep neural network training paradigm that exploits the conjoint
information in multiple heterogeneous sources is proposed. Specifically, in a
RGB-D based action recognition task, it cooperatively trains a single
convolutional neural network (named c-ConvNet) on both RGB visual features and
depth features, and deeply aggregates the two kinds of features for action
recognition. Differently from the conventional ConvNet that learns the deep
separable features for homogeneous modality-based classification with only one
softmax loss function, the c-ConvNet enhances the discriminative power of the
deeply learned features and weakens the undesired modality discrepancy by
jointly optimizing a ranking loss and a softmax loss for both homogeneous and
heterogeneous modalities. The ranking loss consists of intra-modality and
cross-modality triplet losses, and it reduces both the intra-modality and
cross-modality feature variations. Furthermore, the correlations between RGB
and depth data are embedded in the c-ConvNet, and can be retrieved by either of
the modalities and contribute to the recognition in the case even only one of
the modalities is available. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on
two large RGB-D action recognition datasets, ChaLearn LAP IsoGD and NTU RGB+D
datasets, and one small dataset, SYSU 3D HOI, and achieved state-of-the-art
results.

network of interactions among the system's units. In contrast to what happens
with the spreading of epidemics, observations of general perturbations are
often very sparse in time (there is a single observation of the perturbed
system) and in ""space"" (only a few perturbed and unperturbed units are
observed). A major challenge in many areas, from biology to the social
sciences, is to infer the propagation paths from observations of the effects of
perturbation under these sparsity conditions. We address this problem and show
that it is possible to go beyond the usual approach of using the shortest paths
connecting the known perturbed nodes. Specifically, we show that a simple and
general probabilistic model, which we solved using belief propagation, provides
fast and accurate estimates of the probabilities of nodes being perturbed.

bullet flight, including velocity, bullet yaw, and drag. These parameters were
compared for four different bullets fired from a .300 Winchester Magnum under
four different muzzle conditions (no device and three different suppressors).
While effects were not observed in all cases, results indicate that sound
suppressors can have the effect of reducing bullet yaw and drag significantly,
and can also have small effects on muzzle velocity. Results further suggest
that bullets with a propensity to yaw demonstrate significant reductions in yaw
and drag when shot through a two stage symmetric suppressor versus unsuppressed
or with a conventional mouse-hole/K-baffle design.
