orders on finite Coxeter groups. Equivalently, we classify lattice congruences
$\Theta$ on $W$ such that the quotient $W/\Theta$ is isomorphic to $W'$.
Surprisingly, surjective homomorphisms exist quite generally: They exist if and
only if the diagram of $W'$ is obtained from the diagram of $W$ by deleting
vertices, deleting edges, and/or decreasing edge labels. A surjective
homomorphism $W\to W'$ is determined by its restrictions to rank-two standard
parabolic subgroups of $W$. Despite seeming natural in the setting of Coxeter
groups, this determination in rank two is nontrivial. Indeed, from the
combinatorial lattice theory point of view, all of these classification results
should appear unlikely a priori. As an application of the classification of
surjective homomorphisms between weak orders, we also obtain a classification
of surjective homomorphisms between Cambrian lattices and a general
construction of refinement relations between Cambrian fans.

more local dark matter concentrated regions. In particular, Ultra-compact Micro
Halos (UCMHs) seeded by large density perturbations in the early universe,
allocated within ~0.3 kpc from the solar system, could provide the potential
source of electrons and positrons produced from dark matter annihilation,
enough to explain the DAMPE signal. Here we consider a UCMH with density
profile assuming radial in-fall and explore the preferred halo parameters to
explain the 1.4 TeV ""DAMPE excess"". We find that typical parameter space of
UCMHs can easily explain the ""DAMPE excess"" with usual thermal-averaged
annihilation cross section of WIMP. The fraction of dark matter stored in such
UCMHs in the Galactic-scale halo can be reduced to as small as $O(10^{-5})$,
well within the current cosmological and astrophysical constraints.

are able to validate the accuracy of our algorithm by explicitly calculating

cross-entropy loss are ubiquitous tools for image classification. Yet, this
does not naturally enforce intra-class similarity nor inter-class margin of the
learned deep representations. To simultaneously achieve these two goals,
different solutions have been proposed in the literature, such as the pairwise
or triplet losses. However, such solutions carry the extra task of selecting
pairs or triplets, and the extra computational burden of computing and learning
for many combinations of them. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play loss
term for deep networks that explicitly reduces intra-class variance and
enforces inter-class margin simultaneously, in a simple and elegant geometric
manner. For each class, the deep features are collapsed into a learned linear
subspace, or union of them, and inter-class subspaces are pushed to be as
orthogonal as possible. Our proposed Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding (OL\'E) does
not require carefully crafting pairs or triplets of samples for training, and
works standalone as a classification loss, being the first reported deep metric
learning framework of its kind. Because of the improved margin between features
of different classes, the resulting deep networks generalize better, are more
discriminative, and more robust. We demonstrate improved classification
performance in general object recognition, plugging the proposed loss term into
existing off-the-shelf architectures. In particular, we show the advantage of
the proposed loss in the small data/model scenario, and we significantly
advance the state-of-the-art on the Stanford STL-10 benchmark.

comparing simulations of a spherical and a lens-shaped dot using a
well-established correlation expansion approach we show that indeed lens-shaped

influence on the electronic system. We also give a recipe to reproduce spectral
densities from more involved dots by rather simple spherical models. On the
other hand, breaking the spherical symmetry has a pronounced impact on the
spatio-temporal properties of the phonon dynamics. As an example we show that
for a lens-shaped quantum dot the phonon emission is strongly concentrated

can be highly non-trivial. For small hopping, the interplay between dissipation
and strong interactions generally leads to anomalous diffusion in the space of
atomic configurations. However, for a fine-tuned ratio of cavity-mediated and
on-site interactions, we discover a limit featuring normal diffusion. In
contrast, for large hopping and vanishing on-site interactions, the system can
be described by a linear rate equation leading to an exponential approach of
the infinite-temperature steady state. Finally, in the good cavity regime, we
show that for vanishing on-site interactions, the system allows for optical
pumping between momentum mode pairs enabling cavity cooling.

because many mobile applications depend on precise localization measurements.
In some scenarios, however, it is required to trade location accuracy for
system maintainability. For example, in large-scale deployments of indoor
networks, such as item-monitoring in smart buildings, attaining room-level
localization accuracy may be sufficient, but replacing the batteries of the
devices used for localization could lead to high operational costs. As indoor
localization systems grow in popularity it will be important to provide them
with full energy autonomy. To tackle this problem we propose WiPLoc: an indoor
localization system aimed at operating perpetually without batteries. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we propose a novel localization method that
exploits capture effect and orthogonal codes to operate at energy levels that
are low enough to operate within the energy budget provided by long-range
wireless power transmission. Second, we implement WiPLoc using off-the-shelf
components and test it extensively in a laboratory environment. Our test
results show that with WiPLoc one wireless charger per (16 m$^{\text{2}}$) room
can enable perpetual lifetime operation of mobile objects requiring
localization with an average accuracy of almost 90%.

establish uniform ocal $L^2$ estimates for the approximate correctors. Under an
additional assumption on the frequencies of the coefficients (see (1.10)), we
derive the existence of the true correctors as well as the sharp

Since (1.10) is not well-defined for the equivalence classes of almost-periodic

leads to a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, which has received great
interest from both the signal processing and machine learning community over
the last decades. The key ingredient to the problem is how to exploit the
temporal correlation of the MR sequence to resolve the aliasing artefact.
Traditionally, such observation led to a formulation of a non-convex
optimisation problem, which were solved using iterative algorithms. Recently,
however, deep learning based-approaches have gained significant popularity due
to its ability to solve general inversion problems. In this work, we propose a
unique, novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture which
reconstructs high quality cardiac MR images from highly undersampled k-space
data by jointly exploiting the dependencies of the temporal sequences as well
as the iterative nature of the traditional optimisation algorithms. In
particular, the proposed architecture embeds the structure of the traditional
iterative algorithms, efficiently modelling the recurrence of the iterative
reconstruction stages by using recurrent hidden connections over such
iterations. In addition, spatiotemporal dependencies are simultaneously learnt
by exploiting bidirectional recurrent hidden connections across time sequences.
The proposed algorithm is able to learn both the temporal dependency and the
iterative reconstruction process effectively with only a very small number of
parameters, while outperforming current MR reconstruction methods in terms of
computational complexity, reconstruction accuracy and speed.

alliances of firms. Agents are uniformly selected to initiate an alliance and
to invite collaboration partners. These decide about acceptance based on an
individual threshold that is compared with the utility expected from joining
the current alliance. The benefit of alliances results from the fitness of the
agents involved. Fitness is obtained from an empirical distribution of agent's
activities. The cost of an alliance reflects its coordination effort. Two free
parameters $a_{c}$ and $a_{l}$ scale the costs and the individual threshold. If
initiators receive $R$ rejections of invitations, the alliance formation stops
and another initiator is selected. The three free parameters $(a_{c},a_{l},R)$
are calibrated against a large scale data set of about 15,000 firms engaging in
about 15,000 R\&D alliances over 26 years. For the validation of the model we
compare the empirical size distribution with the theoretical one, using
confidence bands, to find a very good agreement. As an asset of our agent-based
model, we provide an analytical solution that allows to reduce the simulation
effort considerably. The analytical solution applies to general forms of the
utility of alliances. Hence, the model can be extended to other cases of
alliance formation. While no information about the initiators of an alliance is
available, our results indicate that mostly firms with high fitness are able to
attract newcomers and to establish larger alliances.

CALET will measure the cosmic ray electron spectrum over the energy range of 1
GeV to 20 TeV with a very high resolution of 2% above 100 GeV, based on a
dedicated instrument incorporating an exceptionally thick 30 radiation-length
calorimeter with both total absorption and imaging (TASC and IMC) units. Each
TASC readout channel must be carefully calibrated over the extremely wide
dynamic range of CALET that spans six orders of magnitude in order to obtain a
degree of calibration accuracy matching the resolution of energy measurements.
These calibrations consist of calculating the conversion factors between ADC
units and energy deposits, ensuring linearity over each gain range, and
providing a seamless transition between neighboring gain ranges. This paper
describes these calibration methods in detail, along with the resulting data
and associated accuracies. The results presented in this paper show that a
sufficient accuracy was achieved for the calibrations of each channel in order

1974, 1991, 1996). Reanalysis of data for other transport, binding and enzyme
systems has also given such kinetics (Nissen and Mart\'in-Nieto 1998).
Recently, such profiles have been found for a variety of biological as well as

binding, pH, folding/unfolding, effects of various interactions and chain
length (Nissen 2015a,b, Nissen 2016a-d). These biological and nonbiological

multiphasic property seen in so many systems is present in the fundamental

  The characteristics of multiphasic profiles have now also been found in
profiles for activities of ions in simple inorganic solutions, indicating that
they are somehow causing the multiphasic profiles in more complex systems. A

attractive for correlated electron materials, where spontaneous

prototypical strongly-correlated metal CeRhIn5, revealing competition between
magnetic frustration and easy-axis anisotropy -- a well-established mechanism

anisotropy is field-induced and anomalously large, it can be controlled

to a problem in quantum information [Nakata et al., Phys. Rev. X 7:021006

$k$-dimensional subspace with the hypercube in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.
We also propose two natural variants of the problem by restricting the type of
subspace allowed.
  We find that whereas every natural number eventually occurs as the
intersection cardinality for some $k$ and $n$, on the other hand for each fixed
k, the possible intersections sizes are governed by severe restrictions. To
wit, while the largest intersection size is evidently $2^k$, there is always a
large gap to the second largest intersection size, which we find to be $\frac34
2^k$ for $k \geq 2$ (and $2^{k-1}$ in the restricted version). We also present
several constructions, and propose a number of open questions and conjectures
for future investigation.

efficiently introducing spatial context in the unmixing problem remains a
challenge, and a necessity for many real world applications. In this paper, a
novel multiscale spatial regularization approach for sparse unmixing is
proposed. The method uses a signal-adaptive spatial multiscale decomposition

Simulation results using both synthetic and real data indicate that the

thus the processing time of data. To reduce the total complexity, also fast

  We address a variant of this problem where one aims to simultaneously embed
larger subsets of the data set. Our method follows an approach by Nelson: A
subsampled Hadamard transform maps points into a space of lower, but not
optimal dimension. Subsequently, a random matrix with independent entries
projects to an optimal embedding dimension.
  For subsets whose size scales at least polynomially in the ambient dimension,
the complexity of this method comes close to the number of operations just to
read the data under mild assumptions on the size of the data set that are
considerably less restrictive than in previous works. We also prove a lower
bound showing that subsampled Hadamard matrices alone cannot reach an optimal
embedding dimension. Hence, the second embedding cannot be omitted.

leverage this sparsity assumption in order to improve the quality of estimation

critical threshold $\beta_p$ so that when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds
$\beta_p$, one can distinguish the spiked and unspiked tensors and weakly
recover the prior via the minimal mean-square-error method. On the other side,
Perry, Wein, and Bandeira (2017) proved that there exists a $\beta_p'<\beta_p$

vanishes, when the signa-to-noise ratio is less than $\beta_p'$. In this work,
we show that $\beta_p$ is indeed the critical threshold that strictly separates
the distinguishability and indistinguishability between the two tensors under
the total variation distance. Our approach is based on a subtle analysis of the
high temperature behavior of the pure $p$-spin model with Ising spin, arising
initially from the field of spin glasses. In particular, we identify the

colloidal ice, we show that colloidal hexagonal artificial spin ice exhibits an
inner phase within its ice state that has not been observed previously. Under
increasing colloid-colloid repulsion, the initially paramagnetic system crosses
into a disordered ice-regime, then forms a topologically charge ordered state
with disordered colloids, and finally reaches a three-fold degenerate, ordered
ferromagnetic state. This is reminiscent of, yet distinct from, the inner
phases of the magnetic kagome spin ice analog. The difference in the inner
phases of the two systems is explained by their difference in energetics and
frustration.

$\mathbf{u}(\cdot, t)$ when $\mathbf{u}(\cdot, t_0)$ has an interior isolated
singular point $\mathbf{x}_0$ of zero index has been studied by Ma and Wang.
Although in the class of divergence free fields which undergo a local
bifurcation around a singular point, the ones with index zero singular points
are generic, this class excludes some important families of symmetric flows. In
particular, when $\mathbf{u}(\cdot, t_0)$ is anti-symmetric with respect to
$\mathbf{x}_0$, or symmetric with respect to the axis located on $\mathbf{x}_0$
and normal to the unique eigendirection of the Jacobian $D\mathbf{u}(\cdot,
t_0)$, the vector field must have index 1 or -1 at the singular point. Thus we
study the structural bifurcation when $\mathbf{u}(\cdot, t_0)$ has an interior
isolated singular point $\mathbf{x}_0$ with index -1, 1. In particular we show
that if such a vector field with its acceleration at $t_0$ both satisfy
aforementioned symmetries then generically the flow will undergo a local
bifurcation. Under these generic conditions, we rigorously prove the existence
of flow patterns such as pairs of co-rotating vortices and double saddle
connections. We also present numerical evidence of Stokes flow in a rectangular

network's topology evolves so does the network's ability to perform various
complex tasks. To explain this, it has also been observed that as a network
grows certain subnetworks begin to specialize the function(s) they perform.
Here, we introduce a class of models of network growth based on this notion of
specialization and show that as a network is specialized using this method its
topology becomes increasingly sparse, modular, and hierarchical, each of which
are important properties observed in real networks. This procedure is also
highly flexible in that a network can be specialized over any subset of its
elements. This flexibility allows those studying specific networks the ability
to search for mechanisms that describe the growth of these particular networks.
As an example, we find that by randomly selecting these elements a network's
topology acquires some of the most well-known properties of real networks
including the small-world property, disassortativity, power-law like degree
distributions, and power-law like clustering coefficients. As far as the
authors know, this is the first such class of models that creates an

question posed by Frieze and Kannan in 1997. This is asymptotically the best
possible estimate and improves on the previous bound of $1/D^2$ by
Kannan-Lov\'asz-Montenegro. It follows that for any isotropic logconcave
density, the ball walk with step size $\delta = (1/\sqrt{n})$ mixes in
$O(n^2D)$ proper steps from any starting point. This improves on the previous
best bound of $O(n^2D^2)$ and is also asymptotically tight. The new bound leads
to the following refined large deviation inequality for any L-Lipschitz
function g over an isotropic logconcave density p: for any t > 0, $$P(|g(x)-

a long-standing problem that has implications to understanding social structure

degree of transitivity, which explains the successes of common neighbor-based
methods for link prediction. In this paper, we examine mechanisms behind link
formation from the perspective of an ego node. We introduce the notion of
personalized degree for each neighbor node of the ego, which is the number of
other neighbors a particular neighbor is connected to. From empirical analyses
on four on-line social network datasets, we find that neighbors with higher
personalized degree are more likely to lead to new link formations when they
serve as common neighbors with other nodes, both in undirected and directed
settings. This is complementary to the finding of Adamic and Adar that neighbor
nodes with higher (global) degree are less likely to lead to new link
formations. Furthermore, on directed networks, we find that personalized
out-degree has a stronger effect on link formation than personalized in-degree,
whereas global in-degree has a stronger effect than global out-degree. We
validate our empirical findings through several link recommendation experiments
and observe that incorporating both personalized and global degree into link
recommendation greatly improves accuracy.

flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), their gamma-ray emission is thought to be
produced via the external Compton mechanism whereby relativistic jet electrons
upscatter a photon field external to the jet, e.g. from the accretion disc,
broad line region (BLR) and dusty torus, to higher energies. Here we study the
origin of the gamma-ray emission in the lowest-redshift candidate among the
currently-known gamma-ray emitting NLS1s, 1H 0323+342, and take a new approach.
We observationally constrain the external photon field using quasi-simultaneous
near-IR, optical and X-ray spectroscopy. Applying a one-zone leptonic jet
model, we simulate the range of jet parameters for which this photon field,
when Compton scattered to higher energies, can explain the gamma-ray emission.
We find that the site of the gamma-ray emission lies well within the BLR and
that the seed photons mainly originate from the accretion disc. The jet power
that we determine, $1.0 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is approximately half the
accretion disc luminosity. We show that this object is not simply a low-mass
FSRQ, its jet is intrinsically less powerful than predicted by scaling a
typical FSRQ jet by black hole mass and accretion rate. That gamma-ray emitting
NLS1s appear to host underpowered jets may go some way to explaining why so few

specific period during which an individual's performance is substantially
higher than her typical performance. While widely debated in sports, gambling,
and financial markets over the past several decades, little is known if hot
streaks apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on
lifecycle of creativity, we collected large-scale career histories of
individual artists, movie directors and scientists, tracing the artworks,
movies, and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all
three domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal
regularity, each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works
occurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be explained
by a simple hot-streak model we developed, allowing us to probe quantitatively
the hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers, which we find to be
remarkably universal across diverse domains we analyzed: The hot streaks are
ubiquitous yet unique across different careers. While the vast majority of
individuals have at least one hot streak, hot streaks are most likely to occur
only once. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's sequence of
works, is temporally localized, and is unassociated with any detectable change
in productivity. We show that, since works produced during hot streaks garner
significantly more impact, the uncovered hot streaks fundamentally drives the
collective impact of an individual, ignoring which leads us to systematically
over- or under-estimate the future impact of a career. These results not only
deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns governing individual
ingenuity and success, they may also have implications for decisions and
policies involving predicting and nurturing individuals with lasting impact.

planets as a function of time. In addition to the transit features created by
the planets, the flux also includes the reflected light component of each
planet, which depends on the planetary albedo. This signal is typically
referred to as phase curve and could be easily identified if there were no
additional noise. As well as instrumental noise, stellar activity, such as
spots, can create a modulation in the data, which may be very difficult to
distinguish from the planetary signal. We analyze the limitations imposed by
the stellar activity on the detection of the planetary albedo, considering the
limitations imposed by the predicted level of instrumental noise and the short
duration of the observations planned in the context of the CHEOPS mission. As
initial condition, we have assumed that each star is characterized by just one
orbiting planet. We built mock light curves that included a realistic stellar
activity pattern, the reflected light component of the planet and an
instrumental noise level, which we have chosen to be at the same level as
predicted for CHEOPS. We then fit these light curves to try to recover the
reflected light component, assuming the activity patterns can be modeled with a
Gaussian process.We estimate that at least one full stellar rotation is
necessary to obtain a reliable detection of the planetary albedo. This result
is independent of the level of noise, but it depends on the limitation of the
Gaussian process to describe the stellar activity when the light curve
time-span is shorter than the stellar rotation. Finally, in presence of typical
CHEOPS gaps in the simulations, we confirm that it is still possible to obtain
a reliable albedo.

based on the optically thin or thick nature of grains with different sizes. The
theoretical emission model was compared to Chandra observations of Comets ISON

the charge-exchange mechanism accurately reproduced the emission spectra below
1 keV, while dust and ice scattering was negligible. Examining the 1-2 keV
range found dust and ice scattering emissions to agree well with observations,
while charge-exchange contributions were insignificant. Spectral features
between the scattering model and observations also trended similarly over the
1-2 keV range. The dust and ice density within the cometary atmosphere $n$ was
varied with respect to grain size $a$ as the function $n(a) \propto

$\alpha = 2.2$ to best fit the observed spectral intensities. These grain size

argue that we should consider relaxing this assumption in a specific way in
some contexts. Namely, there is a collection of open questions in and around
physics that can arguably be addressed in a substantially more consistent and
rigorous way if we consider the possibility that the first-person perspective
is ultimately more fundamental than our usual notion of external world. These
are questions like: which probabilities should an observer assign to future
experiences if she is told that she will be simulated on a computer? How should
we think of cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, and what can we learn from the
fact that measurements in quantum theory seem to do more than just reveal
preexisting properties? Why are there simple computable laws of physics in the
first place? This note summarizes a longer companion paper which constructs a
mathematically rigorous theory along those lines, suggesting a simple and
unified framework (rooted in algorithmic information theory) to address
questions like those above. It is not meant as a ""theory of everything"" (in
fact, it predicts its own limitations), but it shows how a notion of objective
external world, looking very much like our own, can provably emerge from a
starting point in which the first-person perspective is primary, without
apriori assumptions on the existence of ""laws"" or a ""physical world"". While the
ideas here are perfectly compatible with physics as we know it, they imply some
quite surprising predictions and suggest that we may want to substantially

information and knowledge from the data present new challenges for database
researchers. Known database systems and algorithms are no longer capable of
effectively handling such large data sets. MapReduce is a novel programming
paradigm for processing distributable problems over large-scale data using a
computer cluster.
  In this work we explore the MapReduce paradigm from three different angles.
We begin by examining a well-known problem in the field of data mining: mining
closed frequent itemsets over a large dataset. By harnessing the power of
MapReduce, we present a novel algorithm for mining closed frequent itemsets
that outperforms existing algorithms.
  Next, we explore one of the fundamental implications of ""Big Data"": The data
is not known with complete certainty. A probabilistic database is a relational
database with the addendum that each tuple is associated with a probability of
its existence. A natural development of MapReduce is of a distributed
relational database management system, where relational calculus has been
reduced to a combination of map and reduce function. We take this development a
step further by proposing a query optimizer over distributed, probabilistic
database.
  Finally, we analyze the best known implementation of MapReduce called Hadoop,
aiming to overcome one of its major drawbacks: it does not directly support the
explicit specification of the data repeatedly processed throughout different
jobs.Many data-mining algorithms, such as clustering and association-rules
require iterative computation: the same data are processed again and again
until the computation converges or a stopping condition is satisfied. We
propose a modification to Hadoop such that it will support efficient access to
the same data in different jobs.

speech recognition (ASR), are typically trained to optimize the cross-entropy
criterion which corresponds to improving the log-likelihood of the data.
However, system performance is usually measured in terms of word error rate
(WER), not log-likelihood. Traditional ASR systems benefit from discriminative
sequence training which optimizes criteria such as the state-level minimum
Bayes risk (sMBR) which are more closely related to WER. In the present work,
we explore techniques to train attention-based models to directly minimize
expected word error rate. We consider two loss functions which approximate the
expected number of word errors: either by sampling from the model, or by using
N-best lists of decoded hypotheses, which we find to be more effective than the
sampling-based method. In experimental evaluations, we find that the proposed
training procedure improves performance by up to 8.2% relative to the baseline
system. This allows us to train grapheme-based, uni-directional attention-based
models which match the performance of a traditional, state-of-the-art,

P/S spectral amplitude ratios obtained from six underground tests conducted by

Three aftershocks were detected by a prototype waveform cross correlation
procedure with explosions as master events, and one aftershock was found with
the aftershocks as master event. Two seismic arrays USRK and KSRS of the IMS
and two non-IMS 3-C stations SEHB (South Korea) and MDJ (China) were used. With
increasing frequency, all stations demonstrate approximately the same level of
deviation between the Pg/Lg spectral amplitude ratios belonging to the DPRK
explosions and their aftershocks. For a single station, simple statistical
estimates show that the probability of any of six aftershocks not to be a
sample from the explosion population is larger than 99.996% at the KSRS and
even larger at USRK. The probability of any of the DPRK explosion to be a
representative of the aftershock population is extremely small as defined by
the distance of 20 and more standard deviations to the mean explosion Pg/Lg
value. For network discrimination, we use the Mahalanobis distance combining
the Pg/Lg estimates at three stations: USRK, KSRS and MDJ. At frequencies above
4 Hz, the (squared) Mahalanobis distance, D2, between the populations of
explosions and aftershocks is larger than 100. In the frequency band between 6
and 12 Hz at USRK, the aftershocks distance from the average explosion
D2>21,000. Statistically, the probability to confuse explosions and aftershocks

permutation groups. Specifically, we define a notion of quantum isomorphisms of

then show that this is equivalent to the previously defined notion of quantum
isomorphism corresponding to perfect quantum strategies to the isomorphism
game. Moreover, we show that two connected graphs $X$ and $Y$ are quantum
isomorphic if and only if there exists $x \in V(X)$ and $y \in V(Y)$ that are
in the same orbit of the quantum automorphism group of the disjoint union of
$X$ and $Y$. This connection links quantum groups to the more concrete notion
of nonlocal games and physically observable quantum behaviours. We exploit this
link by using ideas and results from quantum information in order to prove new
results about quantum automorphism groups, and about quantum permutation groups
more generally. In particular, we show that asymptotically almost surely all
graphs have trivial quantum automorphism group. Furthermore, we use examples of
quantum isomorphic graphs from previous work to construct an infinite family of
graphs which are quantum vertex transitive but fail to be vertex transitive,
answering a question from the quantum group literature.
  Our main tool for proving these results is the introduction of orbits and
orbitals (orbits on ordered pairs) of quantum permutation groups. We show that
the orbitals of a quantum permutation group form a coherent
configuration/algebra, a notion from the field of algebraic graph theory. We
then prove that the elements of this quantum orbital algebra are exactly the

about 100~m in size. Against expectations based on comets, `Oumuamua does not
show any activity and has a very elongated figure, and also exhibits undamped
rotational tumbling. In contrast, `Oumuamua's trajectory indicates that it was
moving with the local stars, as expected from a low-velocity ejection from a
relatively nearby system. Here I assume that `Oumuamua is typical of 100-m
interstellar objects, and speculate on its origins. I find that giant planets
are relatively inefficient at ejecting small bodies from inner solar systems of
main-sequence stars, and that binary systems offer a much better opportunity
for ejections of non-volatile bodies. I also conclude that `Oumuamua is not a
member of a collisional population, which could explain its dramatic difference
from small asteroids. I observe that 100-m small bodies are expected to carry
little mass in realistic collisional populations, and that occasional events
when whole planets are disrupted in catastrophic encounters may dominate
interstellar population of 100-m fragments. Unlike the Sun or Jupiter, red
dwarf stars are very dense and are capable of thoroughly tidally disrupting
terrestrial planets. I conclude that the origin of `Oumuamua as a fragment from
a planet that was tidally disrupted and then ejected by a dense member of a
binary system could explain its peculiarities.

supposed to describe the objective evolution of a unique external world.
However, this condition is challenged by quantum theory, which suggests that
physical systems should not always be understood as having objective properties
which are simply revealed by measurement. Furthermore, as argued below, several
other conceptual puzzles in the foundations of physics and related fields point
to limitations of our current perspective and motivate the exploration of an
alternative: to start with the first-person (the observer) rather than the
third-person perspective (the world). In this work, I propose a rigorous
approach of this kind on the basis of algorithmic information theory. It is
based on a single postulate: that universal induction determines the chances of
what any observer sees next. That is, instead of a world or physical laws, it
is the local state of the observer alone that determines those probabilities.
Surprisingly, despite its solipsistic foundation, I show that the resulting
theory recovers many features of our established physical worldview: it
predicts that it appears to observers as if there was an external world that
evolves according to simple, computable, probabilistic laws. In contrast to the
standard view, objective reality is not assumed on this approach but rather
provably emerges as an asymptotic statistical phenomenon. The resulting theory
dissolves puzzles like cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, makes concrete
predictions for thought experiments like the computer simulation of agents, and
suggests novel phenomena such as ""probabilistic zombies"" governed by
observer-dependent probabilistic chances. It also suggests that some basic
phenomena of quantum theory (Bell inequality violation and no-signalling) might
be understood as consequences of this framework.

formation history and to the astrophysical processes at play in the
intracluster medium (ICM). The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is
directly sensitive to the line-of-sight integrated ICM pressure, and is thus
particularly adapted to study ICM sub-structures. We apply
structure-enhancement filtering algorithms to high resolution tSZ observations
of distant clusters, in order to search for pressure discontinuities,
compressions, as well as secondary peaks in the ICM. The same filters are
applied to synthetic tSZ images extracted from RHAPSODY-G hydrodynamic
simulations, in order to better interpret the extracted features. We also study
the noise propagation trough the filters and quantify the impact of systematic
effects, point source residuals being identified as the dominant potential
contaminant. In 3 of our 6 NIKA clusters we identify features at high S/N that
show clear evidence for merger events. In MACSJ0717 (z=0.55), three strong
pressure gradients are observed on the E, SE and W sectors, and two main peaks
in the pressure distribution are identified. We observe a lack of tSZ compact
structure in the cool-core cluster PSZ1G045.85 (z=0.61), and a tSZ gradient
ridge dominates in the SE. In the highest z cluster, CLJ1227 (z=0.89), we
detect a ~45"" (360 kpc) long ridge pressure gradient associated with a
secondary pressure peak in the W region. Our results show that current tSZ
facilities have now reached the angular resolution and sensitivity to allow an
exploration of the details of pressure sub-structures in clusters, even at high
z. This opens the possibility to quantify the impact of the dynamical state on
the relation between the tSZ signal and the mass of clusters, which is
important when using tSZ clusters to test cosmological models. This work also
marks the first NIKA cluster sample data release.

massive subhaloes in the cluster host a UDG, UDGs occupy all subhaloes with
\log M_{sub}/M_\odot\gtrsim11. For a model in which the efficiency of UDG
formation is higher around some characteristic halo mass, higher fractions of
massive UDGs require larger spreads in the UDG mass distribution. In a cluster
with a virial mass of 10^{15}M_\odot, the 90% upper limit for the fraction of
UDGs with \log M_{sub}/M_\odot>12 is 7%, occupying 70% of all cluster subhaloes
above the same mass. To reproduce the observed abundances, however, the mass
distribution of satellite UDGs has to be broad, with >30% having \log
M_{sub}/M_\odot<10.9. This strongly supports that UDGs are part of a continuous
distribution in which a majority are hosted by low mass haloes. The abundance
of satellite UDGs may fall short of the linear relation with the cluster/group
mass M_{host} in low-mass hosts, \log M_{host}/M_\odot\sim 12. Characterising
these deviations -- or the lack thereof -- will allow for stringent constraints
on the UDG virial mass distribution.

metallicity and star-formation rate (or molecular-gas mass). This is known as
the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) (or molecular-gas FMR), and it has a
profound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still
remains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a
fourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion
around the molecular-gas FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical
parameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass
is found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new four-dimensional
(4D) fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the
metallicity dispersion to 50% of that of the molecular-gas FMR. We suggest that
future analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a 4D
space that includes surface density. The dilution time scale of gas inflow and
the star-formation efficiency could explain the observational dependence on
surface density of stellar mass. AKARI is expected to play an important role in
shedding light on the infrared properties of the new 4D FMR.

hierarchies in the context of two Higgs doublet models (2HDM). The `flavorful'
2HDM couples the SM-like Higgs doublet exclusively to the third quark
generation, while the first two generations couple exclusively to an additional
source of electroweak symmetry breaking, potentially generating striking
collider signatures. We synthesize the flavorful 2HDM with the `flavor-locking'
mechanism, that dynamically generates large quark mass hierarchies through a
flavor-blind portal to distinct flavon and hierarchon sectors: Dynamical
alignment of the flavons allows a unique hierarchon to control the respective
quark masses. We further develop the theoretical construction of this
mechanism, and show that in the context of a flavorful 2HDM-type setup, it can
automatically achieve realistic flavor structures: The CKM matrix is
automatically hierarchical with $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ generically of the
observed size. Exotic contributions to meson oscillation observables may also
be generated, that may accommodate current data mildly better than the SM
itself.

has provided a time-resolved photometric data set which greatly improved our
understanding of the quasar optical continuum variability: Data for monthly and
longer time-scales are consistent with a damped random walk (DRW). Recently,
newer data obtained by CRTS provided puzzling evidence for enhanced
variability, compared to SDSS results, on monthly time-scales. Quantitatively,
SDSS results predict about 0.06 mag root-mean-square (rms) variability for
monthly time-scales, while CRTS data show about a factor of 2 larger rms, for
spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars. Our analysis has successfully
resolved this discrepancy as due to slightly underestimated photometric
uncertainties from the CRTS image processing pipelines. As a result, the
correction for observational noise is too small and the implied quasar
variability is too large. The CRTS photometric error correction factors,
derived from detailed analysis of non-variable SDSS standard stars that were
re-observed by CRTS, are about 20-30%, and result in reconciling quasar
variability behaviour implied by the CRTS data with earlier SDSS results. An
additional analysis based on independent light curve data for the same objects
obtained by the Palomar Transient Factory provides further support for this
conclusion. In summary, the quasar variability constraints on weekly and
monthly time-scales from SDSS, CRTS and PTF surveys are mutually compatible, as
well as consistent with DRW model.

wavelengths, which is possibly due to dust extinction in their host galaxies as
expected in a scenario in which red quasars are an intermediate population
between merger-driven star-forming galaxies and unobscured type 1 quasars.
However, alternative mechanisms also exist to explain their red colors: (i) an
intrinsically red continuum; (ii) an unusual high covering factor of the hot
dust component, that is, $\rm CF_{HD} = {\it L}_{HD} / {\it L}_{bol}$, where
the ${L}_{\rm HD}$ is the luminosity from the hot dust component and the
${L}_{\rm bol}$ is the bolometric luminosity; and (iii) a moderate viewing
angle. In order to investigate why red quasars are red, we studied optical and
NIR spectra of 20 red quasars at $z\sim$0.3 and 0.7, where the usage of the NIR
spectra allowed us to look into red quasar properties in ways that are little
affected by dust extinction. The Paschen to Balmer line ratios were derived for
13 red quasars and the values were found to be $\sim$10 times higher than
unobscured type 1 quasars, suggesting a heavy dust extinction with $A_V > 2.5$
mag. Furthermore, the Paschen to Balmer line ratios of red quasars are
difficult to explain with plausible physical conditions without adopting the
concept of the dust extinction. The $\rm CF_{HD}$ of red quasars are similar
to, or marginally higher than, those of unobscured type 1 quasars. The
Eddington ratios, computed for 19 out of 20 red quasars, are higher than those
of unobscured type 1 quasars (by factors of $3 \sim 5$), and hence the moderate
viewing angle scenario is disfavored. Consequently, these results strongly
suggest the dust extinction that is connected to an enhanced nuclear activity
as the origin of the red color of red quasars, which is consistent with the
merger-driven quasar evolution scenario.

HI-bearing ultra-diffuse sources (HUDs) based on the completeness limits of the

M_{\rm{HI}}/\rm{M_{\odot}} < 9.5$, have average $r$-band surface brightnesses
fainter than 24 mag arsec$^{-2}$, half-light radii greater than 1.5 kpc, and
are separated from neighbours by at least 350 kpc. We find that HUDs contribute
at most 6% of the population of HI-bearing dwarfs, have a total cosmic number
density of $(1.5 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-3}$ $\rm{Mpc^{-3}}$, and an HI mass
density of $(6.0 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{5}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}\,Mpc^{-3}}$. We
estimate that this is similar to the total cosmic number density of UDGs in
groups and clusters, and conclude that the relation between the number of UDGs
hosted in a halo and the halo mass, must have a break below $M_{200} \sim
10^{12}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in order to account for the abundance of HUDs. The
distribution of the velocity widths of HUDs rises steeply towards low values,
indicating a preference for slow rotation rates. These objects have been absent
from measurements of the galaxy stellar mass function owing to their low
surface brightness. However, we estimate that due to their low number density,
their inclusion would constitute a correction of less than 1%. Comparison with
the Santa Cruz SAM shows that it produces HI-rich central UDGs that have
similar colours to HUDs, but these are currently produced in much great a
number. While previous results from this sample have favoured formation
scenarios where HUDs form in high spin parameter halos, comparisons with the
results of Rong et al. 2017, which invokes that formation mechanism, reveal
that this model produces an order of magnitude more field UDGs than we observe
in the HUD population.(Abridged)

star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction, are measured by fitting
the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models.
We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the
method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies.
With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U-V color
variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in
outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their
galactocentric distance scaled by the semi-major axis of galaxies) changes with
redshift and M* of the host galaxies: at a fixed M*, the slope becomes steeper
toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with
M*. Based on our SED-fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by
a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B-V) gradient, and a
positive specific star formation rate gradient of the clumps. We also find that
the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions.

for conventional acoustic modeling systems. This status quo has begun to be
challenged recently by end-to-end models which seek to combine acoustic,
pronunciation, and language model components into a single neural network. Such
systems, which typically predict graphemes or words, simplify the recognition
process since they remove the need for a separate expert-curated pronunciation
lexicon to map from phoneme-based units to words. However, there has been
little previous work comparing phoneme-based versus grapheme-based sub-word
units in the end-to-end modeling framework, to determine whether the gains from
such approaches are primarily due to the new probabilistic model, or from the
joint learning of the various components with grapheme-based units.
  In this work, we conduct detailed experiments which are aimed at quantifying
the value of phoneme-based pronunciation lexica in the context of end-to-end
models. We examine phoneme-based end-to-end models, which are contrasted
against grapheme-based ones on a large vocabulary English Voice-search task,
where we find that graphemes do indeed outperform phonemes. We also compare
grapheme and phoneme-based approaches on a multi-dialect English task, which
once again confirm the superiority of graphemes, greatly simplifying the system
for recognizing multiple dialects.

black hole pairs co-rotating in galaxies with separations of less than a few
kpc. Expected to be a generic outcome of hierarchical galaxy formation, their
frequency and demographics remain uncertain. We have carried out an imaging
survey with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) of AGNs
with double-peaked narrow [O III] emission lines. HST/WFC3 offers high image
quality in the near-infrared (NIR) to resolve the two stellar nuclei, and in
the optical to resolve [O III] from ionized gas in the narrow-line regions.
This combination has proven to be key in sorting out alternative scenarios.
With HST/WFC3 we are able to explore a new population of close dual AGNs at
more advanced merger stages than can be probed from the ground. Here we show
that the AGN SDSS J0924+0510, which had previously shown two stellar bulges,
contains two spatially distinct [O III] regions consistent with a dual AGN.
While we cannot completely exclude cross-ionization from a single central
engine, the nearly equal ratios of [O III] strongly suggest a dual AGN with a
projected angular separation of 0.""4, corresponding to a projected physical
separation of $r_p$ = 1 kpc at redshift z = 0.1495. This serves as a proof of
principle for combining high-resolution NIR and optical imaging to identify
close dual AGNs. Our result suggests that studies based on low-resolution
and/or low-sensitivity observations may miss close dual AGNs and thereby may
underestimate their occurrence rate on $\lesssim$ kpc scales.

one-shot part labeling: labeling multiple parts of an object in a target image

problem, we introduce the Structured Set Matching Network (SSMN), a structured
prediction model that incorporates convolutional neural networks. The SSMN is
trained using global normalization to maximize local match scores between
corresponding elements and a global consistency score among all matched

SSMN significantly outperforms several strong baselines on three label transfer

this kind of study. Here, we focus on the XXL-South (XXL-S) field. Our main aim

investigate its possible role in AGN triggering and evolution. We studied the
large-scale (>1 Mpc) environment up to redshift z=1 using the nearest neighbour
distance method to compare various pairs of AGN types. We also investigated the
small-scale environment (<0.4 Mpc) by calculating the local overdensities of
optical galaxies. In addition, we built a catalogue of AGN concentrations with
two or more members using the hierarchical clustering method and we correlated
them with the X-ray galaxy clusters detected in the XXL survey. It is found
that radio detected X-ray sources are more obscured than non-radio ones, though
not all radio sources are obscured AGN. We did not find any significant
differences in the large-scale clustering between luminous and faint X-ray AGN,
or between obscured and unobscured ones, or between radio and non-radio
sources. At local scales (<0.4 Mpc), AGN typically reside in overdense regions,
compared to non-AGN; however, no differences were found between the various
types of AGN. A majority of AGN concentrations with two or more members are
found in the neighbourhood of X-ray galaxy clusters within <25-45 Mpc. Our
results suggest that X-ray AGN are typically located in supercluster filaments,
but they are also found in over- and underdense regions.

experimentally realized in quantum gas microscopes. When the hole hopping is
much larger than couplings between the spins, we find strong evidence that
magnetic polarons can be understood as bound states of two partons, a spinon
and a holon carrying spin and charge quantum numbers respectively. We introduce
a microscopic parton description which is benchmarked by comparison with
results from advanced numerical simulations. Using this parton theory, we
predict a series of excited states that are invisible in the spectral function
and correspond to rotational excitations of the spinon-holon pair. This is
reminiscent of mesonic resonances observed in high-energy physics, which can be
understood as rotating quark antiquark pairs. We also apply the strong coupling
parton theory to study far-from equilibrium dynamics of magnetic polarons
observable in current experiments with ultracold atoms. Our work supports
earlier ideas that partons in a confining phase of matter represent a useful
paradigm in condensed-matter physics and in the context of high-Tc
superconductivity. While direct observations of spinons and holons in real
space are impossible in traditional solid-state experiments, quantum gas
microscopes provide a new experimental toolbox. We show that, using this
platform, direct observations of partons in and out-of equilibrium are
possible. Extensions of our approach to the t-J model are also discussed. Our
predictions in this case are relevant to current experiments with quantum gas

puncturing targeted for large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is
proposed. It is well-known that the computational cost of MIMO detection based
on QR decomposition is directly proportional to the number of non-zero entries
involved in back-substitution and slicing operations in the triangularized
channel matrix, which can be too high for low-latency applications involving
large MIMO dimensions. By systematically puncturing the channel to have a
specific structure, it is demonstrated that the detection process can be
accelerated by employing standard schemes such as chase detection, list
detection, nulling-and-cancellation detection, and sub-space detection on the
transformed matrix. The performance of these schemes is characterized and
analyzed mathematically, and bounds on the achievable diversity gain and
probability of bit error are derived. Surprisingly, it is shown that puncturing
does not negatively impact the receive diversity gain in hard-output detectors.
The analysis is extended to soft-output detection when computing per-layer bit
log-likelihood ratios; it is shown that significant performance gains are
attainable by ordering the layer of interest to be at the root when puncturing
the channel. Simulations of coded and uncoded scenarios certify that the
proposed schemes scale up efficiently both in the number of antennas and
constellation size, as well as in the presence of correlated channels. In
particular, soft-output per-layer sub-space detection is shown to achieve a
2.5dB SNR gain at $10^{-4}$ bit error rate in $256$-QAM $16\!\times\!16$ MIMO,
while saving $77\%$ of nulling-and-cancellation computations.

Experimental results show that the simplest model, MLP processing the sum of

electrons coexist with localized moments of Yb-ions which can be described in
terms of effective S = 1/2 spins with dominantly one-dimensional exchange
interaction. The spin subsystem becomes critical in a relatively weak magnetic
field, where it behaves like a Luttinger liquid. We theoretically examine a

rate and the dc resistivity and establish its quasi linear temperature
dependence.

$2$-dimensional sphere which is both the stable manifold of one saddle-focus

invariant manifolds of the equilibria become transversal, and thereby create
homoclinic and heteroclinic tangles. It is known that these newborn structures
are the source of a countable union of topological horseshoes, which prompt the
coexistence of infinitely many sinks and saddle-type invariant sets for many

quasar record holder. Yet, the ISM of this new quasar host galaxy is
significantly enriched by metals, as evidenced by the detection of the [CII]
158micron cooling line and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum
emission. To the first order, the FIR properties of this quasar host are
similar to those found at a slightly lower redshift (z~6), making this source
by far the FIR-brightest galaxy known at z>7.5. The [CII] emission is spatially
unresolved, with an upper limit on the diameter of 7 kpc. Together with the
measured FWHM of the [CII] line, this yields a dynamical mass of the host of
<1.5x10^11 M_sun. Using standard assumptions about the dust temperature and
emissivity, the NOEMA measurements give a dust mass of (0.6-4.3)x10^8 M_sun.
The brightness of the [CII] luminosity, together with the high dust mass, imply
active ongoing star formation in the quasar host. Using [CII]-SFR scaling
relations, we derive star formation rates of 85-545 M_sun/yr in the host,
consistent with the values derived from the dust continuum. Indeed, an episode
of such past high star formation is needed to explain the presence of ~10^8

images, e.g., ""largest elephant standing behind baby elephant"". This is a
general yet challenging vision-language task since it does not only require the
localization of objects, but also the multimodal comprehension of context ---
visual attributes (e.g., ""largest"", ""baby"") and relationships (e.g., ""behind"")
that help to distinguish the referent from other objects, especially those of
the same category. Due to the exponential complexity involved in modeling the
context associated with multiple image regions, existing work oversimplifies
this task to pairwise region modeling by multiple instance learning. In this
paper, we propose a variational Bayesian method, called Variational Context, to
solve the problem of complex context modeling in referring expression
grounding. Our model exploits the reciprocal relation between the referent and
context, i.e., either of them influences the estimation of the posterior
distribution of the other, and thereby the search space of context can be
greatly reduced, resulting in better localization of referent. We develop a
novel cue-specific language-vision embedding network that learns this
reciprocity model end-to-end. We also extend the model to the unsupervised
setting where no annotation for the referent is available. Extensive
experiments on various benchmarks show consistent improvement over
state-of-the-art methods in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

allow a quantum metrological enhancement in phase sensitivity for a small
number n of identical input single photons [1-3]. However, multiphoton
distinguishability at the detectors can play an important role from an
experimental point of view [4]. This raises a fundamental question: How is the
phase sensitivity affected when the photons are completely distinguishable at
the detectors and therefore do not interfere? In other words, which role does
multiphoton interference play in these schemes? Here, we show that for small
phase values the phase sensitivity achievable in the proposed schemes with
indistinguishable photons is enhanced only by a constant factor with respect to
the case of completely distinguishable photons at the detectors. Interestingly,
this enhancement arises from the interference of only a polynomial number (in
n) of the total n! multiphoton path amplitudes in the n-port interferometer.
These results are independent of the number n of single photons and of the
phase weight factors employed at each interferometer channel.

interplay of both phenomena leads to the formation of localized Majorana bound
states (MBS) or likewise (under certain resonance conditions) the formation of
ordinary Andreev bound states (ABS). We investigate the properties of bound
states in junctions composed of alternating regions of F or S barriers.
Interestingly, the direction of magnetization in F regions and the relative
superconducting phase between S regions can be exploited to hybridize MBS or
ABS at will. We show that the local properties of MBS translate into a
particular nonlocal superconducting pairing amplitude. Remarkably, the symmetry
of the pairing amplitude contains information about the nature of the bound
state that it stems from. Hence, this symmetry can in principle be used to
distinguish MBS from ABS, owing to the strong connection between local density
of states and nonlocal pairing in our setup.

deep neural networks utilizing just two descriptors - the Pauling

C3A2D3O12 garnets with extremely low mean absolute errors of 7-8 meV/atom, an
order of magnitude improvement over previous machine learning models and well
within the limits of DFT accuracy. Further extension to mixed garnets with
little loss in accuracy can be achieved using a binary encoding scheme that
introduces minimal increase in descriptor dimensionality. Our results
demonstrate that generalizable deep-learning models for quantitative crystal
stability prediction can be built on a small set of chemically-intuitive

emission. Since the adopted model provides the excitation energy distribution
of these primordial fragments, it allows one to calculate the temperatures of
different isotope families and infer on the sensitivity to their isospin
composition. It is found that, due to the functional form of the nuclear
density of states and the excitation energy distribution of the fragments,
proton rich isotopes are hotter than neutron rich ones. This property has been
taken to be an indication of earlier emission of the former from a source that
cools down as it expands and emits fragments. Although this scenario is
incompatible with the prompt breakup of a thermally equilibrated source, our
results reveal that the latter framework also provides the same qualitative
features just mentioned. Therefore they suggest that this property cannot be

present an updated estimate for TRAPPIST-1 stellar mass, based on two

astrometric binaries. We combine them through a Monte-Carlo approach to derive
a semi-empirical estimate for the mass of TRAPPIST-1. We also derive estimate
for the radius by combining this mass with stellar density inferred from

pay particular attention to the role of many-body localization and the approach
to thermalization, which currently are topics of considerable interest, as they
pertain to the very foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. We
employ local-mode (valence) coordinates and consider initial excitations
localized in one local mode, with energies ranging from low to near the
dissociation threshold, where the classical dynamics have been shown to be
chaotic. We propagate the nuclear wavepacket on the potential energy surface by
means of the numerically exact multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method
and employ mean local energies, time-dependent and time-averaged populations in
quantum number space, energy distributions, entanglement entropies, local
population distributions, microcanonical averages, and dissociation
probabilities, as diagnostic tools. This allows us to identify a continuous
localization $\rightarrow$ delocalization transition in the energy flow,
associated with the onset of quantum chaos, as the excitation energy increases
up to near the dissociation threshold. Moreover, we find that at this energy
and $\sim$1 ps the molecule nearly thermalizes. Furthermore, we observe that
IVR is so slow that the molecule begins to dissociate well before such
quasi-thermalization is complete, in accordance with earlier
classical-mechanical predictions of non-RRKM behavior.

composed of a XXZ quantum spin chain and a Bose-Hubbard model linearly coupled
together. We consider two complementary setups depending whether spatial
disorder is initially imprinted on spins or on bosons; in both cases, we
explore the conditions for the disordered portion of the system to localise by
proximity of the other clean half. Assuming that the dynamics of one of the two
parts develops on shorter time scales than the other, we can adiabatically
eliminate the fast degrees of freedom, and derive an effective hamiltonian for
the system's remainder using projection operator techniques. Performing a
locator expansion on the strength of the many-body interaction term or on the
hopping amplitude of the effective hamiltonian thus derived, we present results
on the stability of the many body localised phases induced by proximity effect.
We also briefly comment on the feasibility of the proposed model through modern
quantum optics architectures, with the long-term perspective to realize
experimentally, in composite open systems, Anderson or many-body localisation
proximity effects.

input images in scenarios where the objects are partly occluded. Recent
RGB-D-based methods are robust to moderate degrees of occlusion. For RGB
inputs, no previous method works well for partly occluded objects. Our main
contribution is to present the first deep learning-based system that estimates
accurate poses for partly occluded objects from RGB-D and RGB input. We achieve
this with a new instance-aware pipeline that decomposes 6D object pose
estimation into a sequence of simpler steps, where each step removes specific
aspects of the problem. The first step localizes all known objects in the image
using an instance segmentation network, and hence eliminates surrounding
clutter and occluders. The second step densely maps pixels to 3D object surface
positions, so called object coordinates, using an encoder-decoder network, and
hence eliminates object appearance. The third, and final, step predicts the 6D
pose using geometric optimization. We demonstrate that we significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art for pose estimation of partly occluded objects
for both RGB and RGB-D input.

Embedding Network (SP-AEN) for zero-shot visual recognition (ZSL), where test
images and their classes are both unseen during training. SP-AEN aims to tackle
the inherent problem --- semantic loss --- in the prevailing family of
embedding-based ZSL, where some semantics would be discarded during training if
they are non-discriminative for training classes, but could become critical for
recognizing test classes. Specifically, SP-AEN prevents the semantic loss by
introducing an independent visual-to-semantic space embedder which disentangles
the semantic space into two subspaces for the two arguably conflicting
objectives: classification and reconstruction. Through adversarial learning of
the two subspaces, SP-AEN can transfer the semantics from the reconstructive
subspace to the discriminative one, accomplishing the improved zero-shot
recognition of unseen classes. Comparing with prior works, SP-AEN can not only
improve classification but also generate photo-realistic images, demonstrating
the effectiveness of semantic preservation. On four popular benchmarks: CUB,
AWA, SUN and aPY, SP-AEN considerably outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods by an absolute performance difference of 12.2\%, 9.3\%, 4.0\%, and

applications and we show how the approximate model checker can be made more

the blur kernel is unknown and must be estimated en route to recover the

imaging devices such as cellphone cameras, must rely on deblurring algorithms
to yield satisfactory image quality. Despite significant research effort,
handling large motions remains an open problem. In this paper, we develop a new
method called Blind Image Deblurring using Row-Column Sparsity (BD-RCS) to
address this issue. Specifically, we model the outer product of kernel and
image coefficients in certain transformation domains as a rank-one matrix, and
recover it by solving a rank minimization problem. Our central contribution
then includes solving {\em two new} optimization problems involving row and
column sparsity to automatically determine blur kernel and image support
sequentially. The kernel and image can then be recovered through a singular
value decomposition (SVD). Experimental results on linear motion deblurring
demonstrate that BD-RCS can yield better results than state of the art,
particularly when the blur is caused by large motion. This is confirmed both
visually and through quantitative measures.

of sub-events. Real-world videos contain multiple activities and are rarely
segmented (e.g., surveillance videos), and learning latent super-events allows
the model to capture how the events are temporally related in videos. We design
temporal structure filters that enable the model to focus on particular
sub-intervals of the videos, and use them together with a soft attention
mechanism to learn representations of latent super-events. Super-event
representations are combined with per-frame or per-segment CNNs to provide
frame-level annotations. Our approach is designed to be fully differentiable,
enabling end-to-end learning of latent super-event representations jointly with
the activity detector using them. Our experiments with multiple public video

significantly benefits activity detection, advancing the state-of-the-arts.

halo in every galaxy. This work presents the first simulation study of an
elliptical galaxy by including both stars and $\psi$DM, focusing on the
systematic changes of the central soliton and halo granules. With the addition
of stars in the inner halo, we find the soliton core consistently becomes more
prominent by absorbing mass from the host halo than that without stars, and the
halo granules become ""non-isothermal"", ""hotter"" in the inner halo and ""cooler""
in the outer halo, as opposed to the isothermal halo in pure $\psi$DM
cosmological simulations. Moreover, the composite (star+$\psi$DM) mass density
is found to follow a $r^{-2}$ isothermal profile near the half-light radius in
most cases. Most striking is the velocity dispersion of halo stars that
increases rapidly toward the galactic center by a factor of at least 2 inside
the half-light radius caused by the deepened soliton gravitational potential, a
result that compares favorably with observations of elliptical galaxies and
bulges in spiral galaxies. However in some rare situations we find a phase
segregation turning a compact distribution of stars into two distinct
populations with high and very low velocity dispersions; while the
high-velocity component mostly resides in the halo, the very low-velocity
component is bound to the interior of the soliton core, resembling stars in
faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

  Distributions",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in visual activity recognition have raised the possibility of
applications such as automated video surveillance. Effective approaches for
such problems however require the ability to recognize the plans of agents from
video information. Although traditional plan recognition algorithms depend on
access to sophisticated planning domain models, one recent promising direction
involves learning approximated (or shallow) domain models directly from the
observed activity sequences DUP. One limitation is that such approaches expect
observed action sequences as inputs. In many cases involving vision/sensing
from raw data, there is considerable uncertainty about the specific action at
any given time point. The most we can expect in such cases is probabilistic
information about the action at that point. The input will then be sequences of
such observed action distributions. In this work, we address the problem of
constructing an effective data-interface that allows a plan recognition module
to directly handle such observation distributions. Such an interface works like
a bridge between the low-level perception module, and the high-level plan
recognition module. We propose two approaches. The first involves resampling
the distribution sequences to single action sequences, from which we could
learn an action affinity model based on learned action (word) embeddings for
plan recognition. The second is to directly learn action distribution
embeddings by our proposed Distr2vec (distribution to vector) model, to
construct an affinity model for plan recognition.

with a variational implicit solvent. Our phase-field free-energy functional
includes the surface energy, solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy,
and electrostatic interaction energy that is described by the Coulomb-field
approximation, all coupled together self-consistently through a phase field. By
introducing a new phase-field term in the description of the solute-solvent van
der Waals and electrostatic interactions, we can keep the phase-field values
closer to those describing the solute and solvent regions, respectively, making
it more accurate in the free-energy estimate. We first prove that our
phase-field functionals $\Gamma$-converge to the corresponding sharp-interface
limit. We then develop and implement an efficient and stable numerical method
to solve the resulting gradient-flow equation to obtain equilibrium
conformations and their associated free energies of the underlying charged
molecular system. Our numerical method combines a linear splitting scheme,
spectral discretization, and exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta
approximations. Applications to the solvation of single ions and a two-plate
system demonstrate that our new phase-field implementation improves the
previous ones by achieving the localization of the system forces near the
solute-solvent interface and maintaining more robustly the desirable hyperbolic
tangent profile for even larger interfacial width. This work provides a scheme
to resolve the possible unphysical feature of negative values in the
phase-field function found in the previous phase-field modeling (cf. H. Sun, et

increasing attention for its ability to decouple the average compartment
anisotropy from orientation dispersion. Advanced diffusion MRI sequences, such
as double diffusion encoding (DDE) and double oscillating diffusion encoding
(DODE) have been used for mapping {\mu}A. However, the time-dependence of
{\mu}A has not been investigated insofar, and furthermore, the accuracy of
{\mu}A estimation vis-\`a-vis different b-values was not assessed. Here, we
investigate both these concepts using theory, simulation, and experiments in
the mouse brain. In the first part, simulations and experimental results show
that the conventional estimation of microscopic anisotropy from the difference
of D(O)DE sequences with parallel and orthogonal gradient directions yields
values that highly depend on the choice of b-value. To mitigate this
undesirable bias, we propose a multi-shell approach that harnesses a polynomial
fit of the signal difference up to third order terms in b-value. In
simulations, this approach yields more accurate {\mu}A metrics, which are
similar to the ground truth values. The second part of this work uses the
proposed multi-shell method to estimate the time/frequency dependence of
{\mu}A. The data shows either an increase or no change in {\mu}A with frequency
depending on the region of interest, both in white and gray matter. When
comparing the experimental results with simulations, it emerges that simple
geometric models such as infinite cylinders with either negligible or finite
radii cannot replicate the measured trend, and more complex models, which, for
example, incorporate structure along the fibre direction are required. Thus,
measuring the time dependence of microscopic anisotropy can provide valuable
information for characterizing tissue microstructure.

an intrinsic dimensional reduction procedure into the SB field equations in
five-dimensions, a MSBT is obtained onto a hypersurface orthogonal to the extra
dimension. This four-dimensional MSBT is shown to bear distinctive new features
in contrast to the usual corresponding SB theory as well as to IMT and the

the herein appealing solutions can emerge solely from the geometrical
reductional process, from presence also of extra dimension(s) and not from any
ad-hoc matter either in the bulk or on the hypersurface.
  Subsequently, we apply the herein MSBT to cosmology and consider an extended
spatially flat FLRW geometry in a five-dimensional vacuum space-time. After
obtaining the exact solutions in the bulk, we proceed to construct, by means of
the MSBT setting, the corresponding dynamic, on the four-dimensional
hypersurface. More precisely, we obtain the (SB) components of the induced
matter, including the induced scalar potential terms. We retrieve two different

a barotropic equation of state for the induced perfect fluid. We then
investigate vacuum, dust, radiation, stiff fluid and false vacuum cosmologies
for this scenario and contrast the results with those obtained in the standard
SB theory, IMT and BD theory. Regarding the second class solutions, we show
that the scale factor behaves similar to a de Sitter (DeS) model. However, in
our MSBT setting, this behavior is assisted by non-vanishing induced matter

This is a consequence of Ng\^o's action of the group scheme J of regular
centralizers in G on all centralizers: the Hamiltonian flows associated to
invariant polynomials integrate to an action of J as commutative symplectic
groupoid. We quantize the Ng\^o action, providing a universal integration for
all quantum Hamiltonian systems coming from the center Z=Z(Ug) of the
enveloping algebra. Namely we extend Kostant's Whittaker description of Z to
the action of a commutative quantum groupoid Wh, the bi-Whittaker Hamiltonian
reduction of $D_G$, which also integrates all quantum Hamiltonian systems
coming from the action of Z. These actions come from a braided tensor functor,
the quantum Ng\^o map, from the W-category (modules for Wh) to
adjoint-equivariant D-modules on G, giving a categorical family of G-invariant
commuting operators on any strong G-category. This action also leads to a
notion of Langlands parameters for categorical representations of G, refined
central character for character sheaves, and a new symmetry of homology of
character varieties.
  We derive our construction as the Langlands dual form of a simple symmetry
principle for groupoids. Namely the symmetric monoidal category of equivariant
sheaves (modules for the groupoid algebra) acts centrally on the corresponding
convolution category. In particular modules for the nil-Hecke algebra for any
Kac-Moody group act centrally on the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke category. We
deduce both the Ng\^o action and its quantization from the case of the
Langlands dual equivariant affine Grassmannian using the renormalized Geometric
Satake theorem of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg.

response for controlling a BCI. The P300 component of an event related
potential is thus widely used in brain-computer interfaces to translate the
subjects' intent by mere thoughts into commands to control artificial devices.
The main challenge in the classification of P300 trials in
electroencephalographic (EEG) data is the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
the P300 response. To overcome the low SNR of individual trials, it is common
practice to average together many consecutive trials, which effectively
diminishes the random noise. Unfortunately, when more repeated trials are
required for applications such as the P300 speller, the communication rate is
greatly reduced. This has resulted in a need for better methods to improve
single-trial classification accuracy of P300 response. In this work, we use
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing method and use Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA)and neural networks for classification. The results
show that a combination of PCA with these methods provided as high as 13\%
accuracy gain for single-trial classification while using only 3 to 4 principal

Vlasov model in axisymmetric tokamak edge plasma geometries. Such models
describe the phase space advection of plasma species distribution functions in
the absence of collisions. The gyrokinetic model is posed in a four-dimensional
phase space, upon which a grid is imposed when discretized. To mitigate the
computational cost associated with high-dimensional grids, we employ a
high-order discretization to reduce the grid size needed to achieve a given
level of accuracy relative to lower-order methods. Strong anisotropy induced by
the magnetic field motivates the use of mapped coordinate grids aligned with
magnetic flux surfaces. The natural partitioning of the edge geometry by the
separatrix between the closed and open field line regions leads to the
consideration of multiple mapped blocks, in what is known as a mapped
multiblock (MMB) approach. We describe the specialization of a more general
formalism that we have developed for the construction of high-order,
finite-volume discretizations on MMB grids, yielding the accurate evaluation of
the gyrokinetic Vlasov operator, the metric factors resulting from the MMB
coordinate mappings, and the interaction of blocks at adjacent boundaries. Our
conservative formulation of the gyrokinetic Vlasov model incorporates the fact
that the phase space velocity has zero divergence, which must be preserved
discretely to avoid truncation error accumulation. We describe an approach for
the discrete evaluation of the gyrokinetic phase space velocity that preserves
the divergence-free property to machine precision.

comparably to target capture in the biologically relevant regime. Because many

increased probability of active transport. We derive parameter-dependent

M(a)\propto\exp\left[-(a/\beta)^\alpha\right]$ where $a$ is the scale factor,
$\alpha(M)\approx0.8$ \& $\beta(M)\approx0.024$, with these parameters
decreasing with decreasing halo mass. Subhaloes follow power-law cumulative
mass and velocity functions, i.e. $n(>f)\propto f^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha_{M}=0.83\pm0.01$ and $\alpha_{V_{\rm max}}=2.13\pm0.03$ for mass \&
velocity respectively, independent of redshift, as seen in previous studies.
The halo-to-halo scatter in amplitude is $0.9$~dex. The number of subhaloes in
a halo weakly correlates with a halo's concentration $c$ \& spin
$\lambda$:haloes of high $c$ \& low $\lambda$ have $60\%$ more subhaloes than
similar mass haloes of low $c$ \& high $\lambda$. High cadence tracking shows
subhaloes are dynamic residents, with $25\%$ leaving their host halo
momentarily, becoming a backsplash subhalo, and another $20\%$ changing hosts
entirely, in agreement with previous studies. In general, subhaloes have
elliptical orbits, $e\approx0.6$, with periods of $2.3^{+2.1}_{-1.7}$~Gyrs.
Subhaloes lose most of their mass at pericentric passage with mass loss rates
of $\sim40\%$~Gyr$^{-1}$. These catalogues will be made publicly available.

velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm LOS}$) of the dark matter halo associated
with their central galaxy, and thereby to estimate the halo's mass. Recent
observational dispersion estimates of the Local Group, including the Milky Way
and M31, suggest $\sigma\sim$50 km/s, which is surprisingly low when compared
to the theoretical expectation of $\sigma\sim$100s km/s for systems of their
mass. Does this pose a problem for $\Lambda$CDM? We explore this tension using
the {\small{SURFS}} suite of $N$-body simulations, containing over 10000
(sub)haloes with well tracked orbits. We test how well a central galaxy's host
halo velocity dispersion can be recovered by sampling $\sigma_{\rm LOS}$ of
subhaloes and surrounding haloes. Our results demonstrate that $\sigma_{\rm
LOS}$ is biased mass proxy. We define an optimal window in $v_{\rm LOS}$ and
projected distance ($D_p$) -- $0.5\lesssim D_p/R_{\rm vir}\lesssim1.0$ and
$v_{\rm LOS} \lesssim0.5V_{\rm esc}$, where $R_{\rm vir}$ is the virial radius
and $V_{\rm esc}$ is the escape velocity -- such that the scatter in LOS to
halo dispersion is minimised - $\sigma_{\rm LOS}=(0.5\pm0.1)\sigma_{v,{\rm
H}}$. We argue that this window should be used to measure line-of-sight
dispersions as a proxy for mass, as it minimises scatter in the $\sigma_{\rm
LOS}-M_{\rm vir}$ relation. This bias also naturally explains the results from
\cite{mcconnachie2012a}, who used similar cuts when estimating $\sigma_{\rm
LOS,LG}$, producing a bias of $\sigma_{\rm LG}=(0.44\pm0.14)\sigma_{v,{\rm
H}}$. We conclude that the Local Group's velocity dispersion does not pose a
problem for $\Lambda$CDM and has a mass of $\log M_{\rm LG,
vir}/M_\odot=12.0^{+0.8}_{-2.0}$.

on the multi-field realization of inflation where a spectator pseudo-scalar
$\sigma$ induces a significant amplification of the ${\rm U}(1)$ gauge fields

model, both the scalar $\sigma$ and the Abelian gauge fields are
gravitationally coupled to the inflaton sector, therefore they can only affect
the primordial scalar and tensor fluctuations through their mixing with

sourced contributions to the scalar correlators can be dangerously large to
invalidate a large tensor power spectrum through the particle production
mechanism. In this paper, we re-examine these recent claims by explicitly
calculating the dominant contribution to the scalar power and bispectrum.
Particularly, we show that once the current limits from CMB data are taken into

direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. As the rank norm penalty in an LRMR is
NP-hard to compute, the nuclear norm (or the trace norm for a positive
semidefinite (PSD) matrix) has been often employed as a convex relaxation of
the rank norm. However, solving a nuclear norm convex problem may lead to a
suboptimal solution of the original rank norm problem. In this paper, we
propose to apply a family of nonconvex penalties on the singular values of the
covariance matrix as the sparsity metrics to approximate the rank norm. In
particular, we formulate a nonconvex minimization problem and solve it by using
a locally convergent iterative reweighted strategy in order to enhance the
sparsity and resolution. The problem in each iteration is convex and hence can
be solved by using the optimization toolbox. Convergence analysis shows that
the new method is able to obtain a suboptimal solution. The connection between
the proposed method and the sparse signal reconstruction (SSR) is explored
showing that our method can be regarded as a sparsity-based method with the
number of sampling grids approaching infinity. Two feasible implementation
algorithms that are based on solving a duality problem and deducing a
closed-form solution of the simplified problem are also provided for the convex
problem at each iteration to expedite the convergence. Extensive simulation
studies are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed methods.

  Using Sparse Time Series Models",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic signals as part of intelligent transportation systems can play a
significant role toward making cities smart. Conventionally, most traffic
lights are designed with fixed-time control, which induces a lot of slack time
(unused green time). Actuated traffic lights control traffic flow in real time
and are more responsive to the variation of traffic demands. For an isolated
signal, a family of time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA) models can be beneficial for predicting the next cycle length.
However, when there are multiple signals placed along a corridor with different
spacing and configurations, the cycle length variation of such signals is not
just related to each signal's values, but it is also affected by the platoon of
vehicles coming from neighboring intersections. In this paper, a multivariate
time series model is developed to analyze the behavior of signal cycle lengths
of multiple intersections placed along a corridor in a fully actuated setup.
Five signalized intersections have been modeled along a corridor, with
different spacing among them, together with multiple levels of traffic demand.
To tackle the high-dimensional nature of the problem, penalized least squares
method are utilized in the estimation procedure to output sparse models. Two
proposed sparse time series methods captured the signal data reasonably well,
and outperformed the conventional vector autoregressive (VAR) model - in some
cases up to 17% - as well as being more powerful than univariate models such as
ARIMA.

Under a cut-off approximation and taking the Fourier representation of

calculate the spectral density function of electrons, and obtain that besides
two main peaks corresponding to the lower and upper Hubbard bands in the

(and other multimedia content) with narrative text to create narrative
visualizations. Often, however, the two elements are presented independently of
one another. We propose an approach to automatically integrate text and
visualization elements. We begin with a writer's narrative that presumably can
be supported with visual data evidence. We leverage natural language
processing, quantitative narrative analysis, and information visualization to
(1) automatically extract narrative components (who, what, when, where) from
data-rich stories, and (2) integrate the supporting data evidence with the text
to develop a narrative visualization. We also employ bidirectional interaction
from text to visualization and visualization to text to support reader
exploration in both directions. We demonstrate the approach with a case study
in the data-rich field of sports journalism.

with zero-age main sequence masses smaller than $16$-$18\ M_\odot$ explode when
they are red supergiants, producing type IIP supernovae. This may imply that
more massive stars produce other types of supernovae or they simply collapse to
black holes without giving rise to bright supernovae. This failed supernova
hypothesis can lead to significantly inefficient oxygen production because
oxygen abundantly produced in inner layers of massive stars with zero-age main
sequence masses around $20$-$30\ M_\odot$ might not be ejected into the
surrounding interstellar space. We first assume an unspecified population of
oxygen injection events related to massive stars and obtain a model-independent
constraint on how much oxygen should be released in a single event and how
frequently such events should happen. We further carry out one-box galactic
chemical enrichment calculations with different mass ranges of massive stars
exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Our results suggest that the model
assuming that all massive stars with $9$-$100\ M_\odot$ explode as
core-collapse supernovae is still most appropriate in explaining the solar
abundances of oxygen and iron and their enrichment history in the Galaxy. The
oxygen mass in the Galaxy is not explained when assuming that only massive
stars with zero-age main sequence masses in the range of 9-17 $M_\odot$,
contribute to the galactic oxygen enrichment. This finding implies that a good
fraction of stars more massive than $17M_\odot$ should eject their oxygen
layers in either supernova explosions or some other mass loss processes.

customers when they purchase products, and to sellers and manufacturers when

compatibility analysis and function satisfiability analysis, where the second
problem is a generalization of the first problem (e.g., whether a product works
with another product can be considered as a special function). We first
identify a novel question and answering corpus that is up-to-date regarding
product compatibility and functionality information. To allow automatic
discovery product compatibility and functionality, we then propose a deep
learning model called Dual Attention Network (DAN). Given a QA pair for a
to-be-purchased product, DAN learns to 1) discover complementary products (or
functions), and 2) accurately predict the actual compatibility (or
satisfiability) of the discovered products (or functions). The challenges
addressed by the model include the briefness of QAs, linguistic patterns
indicating compatibility, and the appropriate fusion of questions and answers.
We conduct experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively show that the
identified products and functions have both high coverage and accuracy,
compared with a wide spectrum of baselines.

existing BA methods that only consider an ADC power constraint, the proposed
algorithm regards total receiver power constraint for a hybrid analog-digital
beamforming architecture. The major challenge is the non-linearities in the
minimization problem. To address this issue, we first convert the problem into
a convex optimization problem through real number relaxation and substitution
of ADC resolution switching power with constant average switching power. Then,
we derive a closed-form solution by fixing the number of activated radio
frequency (RF) chains M. Leveraging the solution, the binary search finds the
optimal M and its corresponding optimal solution. We also provide an off-line
training and modeling approach to estimate the average switching power.
Simulation results validate the spectral and energy efficiency of the proposed
algorithm. In particular, existing state-of-the-art digital beamformers can be
used in the system in conjunction with the BA algorithm as it makes the
quantization error negligible in the low-resolution regime.

yet, despite four decades of observations, their origin is still unknown. Many
candidates have been proposed, such as supernovae and low mass X-ray binaries.
However, these models are difficult to reconcile with the distribution of
positrons, which are highly concentrated in the Galactic bulge, and therefore
require specific propagation of the positrons through the interstellar medium.
Alternative sources include dark matter decay, or the supermassive black hole,
both of which would have a naturally high bulge-to-disc ratio.
  The chief difficulty in reconciling models with the observations is the
intrinsically poor angular resolution of gamma-ray observations, which cannot
resolve point sources. Essentially all of the positrons annihilate via the
formation of positronium. This gives rise to the possibility of observing
recombination lines of positronium emitted before the atom annihilates. These
emission lines would be in the UV and the NIR, giving an increase in angular
resolution of a factor of 10^4 compared to gamma ray observations, and allowing
the discrimination between point sources and truly diffuse emission.
  Analogously to the formation of positronium, it is possible to form atoms of
true muonium and true tauonium. Since muons and tauons are intrinsically
unstable, the formation of such leptonium atoms will be localised to their
places of origin. Thus observations of true muonium or true tauonium can
provide another way to distinguish between truly diffuse sources such as dark
matter decay, and an unresolved distribution of point sources.

incentive is introduced by the Nakamoto consensus protocol to guide the
behaviors of the full nodes (i.e., block miners) in the process of maintaining
the consensus about the blockchain state. The block miners have to devote their
computation power measured in hash rate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition
to win the reward of publishing (a.k.a., mining) new blocks. Due to the
exponentially increasing difficulty of the crypto-puzzle, individual block
miners tends to join mining pools, i.e., the coalitions of miners, in order to
reduce the income variance and earn stable profits. In this paper, we study the
dynamics of mining pool selection in a blockchain network, where mining pools
may choose arbitrary block mining strategies. We identify the hash rate and the
block propagation delay as two major factors determining the outcomes of mining
competition, and then model the strategy evolution of the individual miners as
an evolutionary game. We provide the theoretical analysis of the evolutionary
stability for the pool selection dynamics in a case study of two mining pools.
The numerical simulations provide the evidence to support our theoretical
discoveries as well as demonstrating the stability in the evolution of miners'
strategies in a general case.

described as an optically thick cool gas flow in a disk for high accretion
rates or as a hot coronal optically thin gas flow for low accretion rates,
possibly affected by outflowing gas. The detection of broad iron emission lines
in active galactic nuclei (AGN) indicates the coexistence of corona and disk.
The appearance and relative strength of such flows essentially depends on their
interaction. Liu et al. suggested that condensation of gas from the corona to
the disk allows to understand accretion flows of comparable strength of
emission. Matter inflow due to gravitational capture of gas is important for
the condensation process. We discuss observational features predicted by the
model. Data from simultaneous observations of AGN with {\it {Swift's}} X-ray
and UV-optical telescopes are compared with the theoretical predictions. The
frequent detection of broad iron K$\alpha$ emission lines and the dependence of
the emitted spectra on the Eddington ratio, described by the values of the
photon index $\Gamma$ and the two-point spectral index $\alpha_{\rm{ox}}$ are
in approximate agreement with the predictions of the condensation model; the
latter, however, with a large scatter. The model further yields a coronal
emission concentrated in a narrow inner region as is also deduced from the
analysis of emissivity profiles. The accretion flows in bright AGN could be
described by the accretion of stellar wind or interstellar medium and its
condensation into a thin disk.

from that the representation of pixel-level image usually lacks of high-level
semantic information as in its matched sentence. In this work, we propose a
semantic-enhanced image and sentence matching model, which can improve the
image representation by learning semantic concepts and then organizing them in
a correct semantic order. Given an image, we first use a multi-regional
multi-label CNN to predict its semantic concepts, including objects,

concepts lead to diverse semantic meanings, we use a context-gated sentence
generation scheme for semantic order learning. It simultaneously uses the image
global context containing concept relations as reference and the groundtruth
semantic order in the matched sentence as supervision. After obtaining the
improved image representation, we learn the sentence representation with a
conventional LSTM, and then jointly perform image and sentence matching and
sentence generation for model learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our learned semantic concepts and order, by achieving the

nature's most efficient mechanisms. In contrast, many state-of-the-art
computational saliency models are complex and inefficient. Most saliency models
process high-resolution color (HC) images; however, insights into the
evolutionary origins of visual salience detection suggest that achromatic
low-resolution vision is essential to its speed and efficiency. Previous
studies showed that low-resolution color and high-resolution grayscale images
preserve saliency information. However, to our knowledge, no one has
investigated whether saliency is preserved in low-resolution grayscale (LG)
images. In this study, we explain the biological and computational motivation
for LG, and show, through a range of human eye-tracking and computational
modeling experiments, that saliency information is preserved in LG images.
Moreover, we show that using LG images leads to significant speedups in model
training and detection times and conclude by proposing LG images for fast and
efficient salience detection.

whether one can take the limit of multiple Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) as
the number of slits $N$ goes to infinity. When the $N$ slits grow from points

the upper half plane ${\mathbb{H}}$, an ordinary differential equation
describing time evolution of the conformal map $g_t(z)$ was derived in the $N
\to \infty$ limit, which is coupled with a complex Burgers equation in the
inviscid limit. It is well known that the complex Burgers equation governs the
hydrodynamic limit of the Dyson model defined on ${\mathbb{R}}$ studied in
random matrix theory, and when all particles start from the origin, the
solution of this Burgers equation is given by the Stieltjes transformation of
the measure which follows a time-dependent version of Wigner's semicircle law.

time-dependent version of Wigner's semicircle law determines the time evolution
of the SLE hull, $K_t \subset {\mathbb{H}} \cup {\mathbb{R}}$ , in this

the slits start from $a>0$ and another half of slits start from $-a < 0$, and
determine the multiple SLE in the hydrodynamic limit. After reporting these
exact solutions, we will discuss the universal long-term behavior of the
multiple SLE and its hull $K_t$ in the hydrodynamic limit.

properties and functionalities of advanced out-of-equilibrium materials. We
have taken myelin as a model of supramolecular assembly in out-of-equilibrium
living matter. Myelin sheath is a simple stable multi-lamellar structure of
high relevance and impact in biomedicine. Although it is known that myelin has
a quasi-crystalline ultrastructure there is no information on its fluctuations
at nanoscale in different states due to limitations of the available standard
techniques. To overcome these limitations, we have used Scanning micro X-ray
Diffraction, which is a non-invasive probe of both reciprocal and real space to
visualize statistical fluctuations of myelin order of the sciatic nerve of
Xenopus Laevis. The results show that the ultrastructure period of the myelin
is stabilized by large anti-correlated fluctuations at nanoscale, between
hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers. The ratio between the total thickness of
hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers defines the conformational parameter, which
describes the different states of myelin. Our key result is that myelin in its
out-of-equilibrium functional state fluctuates point-to-point between different
conformations showing a correlated disorder described by a Levy distribution.
As the system approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium in an aged state the
disorder loses its correlation degree and the structural fluctuation
distribution changes to Gaussian. In a denatured state at low pH, it changes to
a completely disordered stage. Our results clarify also the degradation
mechanism in biological systems by associating these states with variation of
the ultrastructural dynamic fluctuations at nanoscale.

With the density-dependent couplings for baryons of F. Hofmann et al., the
$\sigma_{N\pi \rightarrow \Delta}^*$ is decreased (increased) moderately with
increasing density with (without) the consideration of the density dependent
pion effective mass. Meanwhile, if the invariant mass of the system is not far

obvious than that of pion mesons but much weaker than the mass splitting in the

  exit capacity paradigm for bottlenecks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For safety reasons, it is important that the design of buildings and public
facilities comply with the guidelines compiled in building codes.The latter are
often premised on the concept of exit capacity, \emph{i.e.}, the mean
pedestrian flow rate through a bottleneck (at congestion). Here, we argue that
one should duly take into account the evacuation time fluctuations when
devising these guidelines. This is particularly true when the narrowing
isabrupt and the crowd may behave competitively. We suggest a simple way to
assess the extent of (part of) these fluctuations on the basis of the
statistics of time gaps between successive escapes through the
consideredbottleneck, which in practice could be garnered by analysing
recordings of future real evacuations or, perhaps, realistic drills (in the
limits of what is ethically possible). We briefly present a test of the
proposed strategy using a cellular automaton model and confirm its validity
under some conditions, but alsodisclose some of its limitations. In particular,
it may severely underestimate fluctuations in the presence of strong
correlations in the pedestrians' behaviours(while still performing better than
only the mean capacity).

carefully examine the accretion flow dynamics by 2.5-dimensional general
relativistic (GR) radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, comparing
the cases of accretion onto a non-magnetized neutron star (NS) and that onto a
black hole (BH). Supercritical BH accretion is relatively easy, since BH can
swallow excess radiation energy, so that radiation flux can be inward in its
vicinity. This mechanism can never work for NS which has a solid surface. In
fact, we find that the radiation force is always outward. Instead, we found
significant reduction in the mass accretion rate due to strong
radiation-pressure driven outflow. The radiation flux $F_\mathrm{rad}$ is
self-regulated such that the radiation force balances with the sum of gravity
and centrifugal forces. Even when the radiation energy density much exceeds
that expected from the Eddington luminosity $E_\mathrm{rad} \simeq
F_\mathrm{rad}\tau/c> 10^2 L_\mathrm{Edd}/(4\pi r^2 c)$, the radiation flux is
always kept below the certain value which makes it possible not to blow all the
gas away from the disk. These effects make supercritical accretion feasible. We
also find that a settling region, where accretion is significantly decelerated
by radiation cushion, is formed around the NS surface. In the settling region,
the radiation temperature and mass density roughly follow $T_\mathrm{rad}
\propto r^{-1}$ and $\rho \propto r^{-3}$, respectively. No settling region
appears around the BH so that matter can be directly swallowed by the BH with
supersonic speed.

  Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations","57 pages,16 figures",,,,"math.OC stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods are widely used to assess
parametric uncertainties of hydrologic models conditioned on measurements of
observable state variables. However, when the model is CPU-intensive and
high-dimensional, the computational cost of MCMC simulation will be
prohibitive. In this situation, a CPU-efficient while less accurate
low-fidelity model (e.g., a numerical model with a coarser discretization, or a
data-driven surrogate) is usually adopted. Nowadays, multi-fidelity simulation
methods that can take advantage of both the efficiency of the low-fidelity
model and the accuracy of the high-fidelity model are gaining popularity. In
the MCMC simulation, as the posterior distribution of the unknown model
parameters is the region of interest, it is wise to distribute most of the
computational budget (i.e., the high-fidelity model evaluations) therein. Based
on this idea, in this paper we propose an adaptive multi-fidelity MCMC
algorithm for efficient inverse modeling of hydrologic systems. In this method,
we evaluate the high-fidelity model mainly in the posterior region through
iteratively running MCMC based on a Gaussian process (GP) system that is
adaptively constructed with multi-fidelity simulation. The error of the GP
system is rigorously considered in the MCMC simulation and gradually reduced to
a negligible level in the posterior region. Thus, the proposed method can
obtain an accurate estimate of the posterior distribution with a small number
of the high-fidelity model evaluations. The performance of the proposed method
is demonstrated by three numerical case studies in inverse modeling of
hydrologic systems.

the parametric method. Compared to analog phase alignment (APA), they can
significantly reduce the complexity in the PA phases. Subsequently, a fast root
multiple signal classification HDAPA (Root-MUSIC-HDAPA) method is proposed
specially for this hybrid structure to implement an approximately analytical

direction-finding ambiguity. A smart strategy of maximizing the average receive
power is adopted to delete those spurious solutions and preserve the true
optimal solution by linear searching over a set of limited finite candidate
directions. This results in a significant reduction in computational
complexity. Eventually, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of finding emitter

$-\mathbf{k}$ points with the opposite spins, and the external magnetic field
$B$ further breaking $T$ leads to the directional dependence of the nonlinear
resistivity called magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA). Here we demonstrate
theoretically that the two-component nature of the order parameter, i.e., even
and odd pairings, leads to the gigantic enhancement of the MCA in the

most blazars appear as luminous sources characterized by noticeable and fast
flux changes at all frequencies. The mechanisms producing their unpredictable
variability are debated and include injection, acceleration and cooling of
particles, with possible intervention of shock waves or turbulence. Changes in
the viewing angle of the emitting knots or jet regions have also been suggested
to explain flaring events or specific properties such as intraday variability,
quasi-periodicities, or the delay of radio flux variations relative to optical
changes. However, such a geometric interpretation has not been universally
accepted because alternative explanations based on changes of physical
conditions can also work in many cases. Here we report the results of
optical-to-radio monitoring of the blazar CTA 102 by the Whole Earth Blazar
Telescope Collaboration and show that the observed long-term flux and spectral
variability is best explained by an inhomogeneous, curved jet that undergoes
orientation changes. We propose that magnetohydrodynamic instabilities or
rotation of a twisted jet cause different jet regions to change their
orientation and hence their relative Doppler factors. In particular, the recent

problems. Both theoretical and practical aspects are considered with three main
results reported. The first one is about a Dynamic Programming algorithm which
solves the F3Cmax problem in O*(3^n) time and space. The algorithm is easily
generalized to other flowshop problems and single machine scheduling problems.
The second contribution is about a search tree method called Branch & Merge
which solves the 1||SumTi problem with the time complexity converging to
O*(2^n) and in polynomial space. Our third contribution aims to improve the
practical efficiency of exact search tree algorithms solving scheduling
problems. First we realized that a better way to implement the idea of Branch &
Merge is to use a technique called Memorization. By the finding of a new
algorithmic paradox and the implementation of a memory cleaning strategy, the
method succeeded to solve instances with 300 more jobs with respect to the
state-of-the-art algorithm for the 1||SumTi problem. Then the treatment is
extended to another three problems 1|ri|SumCi, 1|dtilde|SumwiCi and F2||SumCi.
The results of the four problems all together show the power of the
Memorization paradigm when applied on sequencing problems. We name it Branch &
Memorize to promote a systematic consideration of Memorization as an essential
building block in branching algorithms like Branch and Bound. The method can
surely also be used to solve other problems, which are not necessarily
scheduling problems.

proposed for secure transmission with artificial noise (AN)-aided directional
modulation (DM) in wireless networks. The proposed scheme is carried out in
three steps. Firstly, the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the signals from the
desired user and eavesdropper are estimated by the Root Multiple Signal
Classificaiton (Root-MUSIC) algorithm and the related signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs) are estimated based on the ratio of the corresponding eigenvalue to the
minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the received signals. In the
second step, the value intervals of DOA estimation errors are predicted based
on the DOA and SNR estimations. Finally, a robust NSP beamforming DM system is
designed according to the afore-obtained estimations and predictions. Our
examination shows that the proposed scheme can significantly outperform the
conventional non-adaptive robust scheme and non-robust NSP scheme in terms of
achieving a much lower bit error rate (BER) at the desired user and a much
higher secrecy rate (SR). In addition, the BER and SR performance gains
achieved by the proposed scheme relative to other schemes increase with the
value range of DOA estimation error.

is also known to play an essential role in the optical properties of atomic
ensembles, but fundamental effects in the controlled emission and absorption
from small, well-defined numbers of entangled emitters in free space have
remained unobserved. Here we present the control of the spontaneous emission
rate of a single photon from a pair of distant, entangled atoms into a
free-space optical mode. Changing the length of the optical path connecting the
atoms modulates the emission rate with a visibility $V = 0.27 \pm 0.03$
determined by the degree of entanglement shared between the atoms,
corresponding directly to the concurrence $\mathcal{C_{\rho}}= 0.31 \pm 0.10$
of the prepared state. This scheme, together with population measurements,
provides a fully optical determination of the amount of entanglement.
Furthermore, large sensitivity of the interference phase evolution points to
applications of the presented scheme in high-precision gradient sensing.

machine translation (NMT), which typically relies on recurrent neural networks

the decoding process. This design of encoder yields relatively uniform
composition on source sentence, despite the gating mechanism employed in
encoding RNN. On the other hand, we often hope the decoder to take pieces of
source sentence at varying levels suiting its own linguistic structure: for
example, we may want to take the entity name in its raw form while taking an
idiom as a perfectly composed unit. Motivated by this demand, we propose
Multi-channel Encoder (MCE), which enhances encoding components with different
levels of composition. More specifically, in addition to the hidden state of
encoding RNN, MCE takes 1) the original word embedding for raw encoding with no
composition, and 2) a particular design of external memory in Neural Turing

are properly blended during decoding. Empirical study on Chinese-English

defined as the potential energy of a moist atmosphere relative to that of the
adiabatically sorted reference state defining a global potential energy
minimum. Finding such a reference state was recently shown to be a linear
assignment problem, and therefore exactly solvable. However, this is
computationally extremely expensive, so there has been much interest in
developing heuristic methods for computing MAPE in practice. Comparisons of the
accuracy of such approximate algorithms have so far been limited to a small
number of test cases; this work provides an assessment of the algorithms'
performance across a wide range of atmospheric soundings, in two different
locations. We determine that the divide-and-conquer algorithm is the best
suited to practical application, but suffers from the previously overlooked
shortcoming that it can produce a reference state with higher potential energy
than the actual state, resulting in a negative value of MAPE. Additionally, we
show that it is possible to construct an algorithm exploiting a theoretical
expression linking MAPE to Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)
previously derived by Kerry Emanuel. This approach has a similar accuracy to
existing approximate sorting algorithms, whilst providing greater insight into
the physical source of MAPE. In light of these results, we discuss how to make
progress towards constructing a satisfactory moist APE theory for the
atmosphere. We also outline a method for vectorising the adiabatic lifting of
moist air parcels, which increases the computational efficiency of algorithms
for calculating MAPE, and could be used for other applications such as
convection schemes.

driven flow in the liquid planetary core, we investigate, through numerical
simulations, the precessing fluid motion in a rotating cylindrical annulus
which possesses slow precession simultaneously. The same problem has been
studied extensively in cylinders where the precessing flow is characterized by
three key parameters: the Ekman number $E$, the Poincar$\acute{\mathrm e}$
number $Po$ and the radius-height aspect ratio $\Gamma$. While in an annulus,
there is another parameter, the inner-radius-height aspect ratio $\Upsilon$,
which also plays an important role in controlling the structure and evolution
of the flow. By decomposing the nonlinear solution into a set of inertial
modes, we demonstrate the properties of both weakly and moderately precessing
flows. It is found that, when the precessional force is weak, the flow is
stable with a constant amplitude of kinetic energy. As the precessional force
increases, our simulation suggests that the nonlinear interaction between the
boundary effects and the inertial modes can trigger more turbulence,
introducing a transitional regime of rich dynamics to disordered flow. The
inertial mode $\bm u_{111}$, followed by $\bm u_{113}$ or $\bm u_{112}$, always
dominates the precessing flow when $0.001\leq Po\leq 0.05$, ranging from weak
to moderate precession. Moreover, the precessing flow in an annulus shows more
stability than in a cylinder which is likely to be caused by the effect of the
inner boundary that restricts the growth of resonant and non-resonant inertial
modes. Furthermore, the mechanism of triadic resonance is not found in the
transitional regime from the laminar to disordered flow.

the zero-field energy spectrum, the zero-field phase-shift depends on the
geometry of the cell-periodic Bloch states via two contributions: the Berry

introducing highly charged particle elicit both collective and single particle
responses. The single particle collisional interaction often generates highly
energetic few particles which move with speeds exceeding the acoustic and also
the shock velocity (which gets excited by the external moving body inserted in
the medium). The dust crystal is observed to crack and deform along the path of
these energetic particles. Ultimately as they slow down they excite collective
response in the medium. It is thus observed that the medium ahead of the shock
gets disturbed by these energetic particles generated by collisional
interaction. The trailing shock then sees a disturbed medium. It is thus clear
that there is an interesting interplay between the single particle and
collective response in the medium which governs the dynamics.

the fixations during a free-viewing task. We argue that fixations are not

filter the fixations recorded during exploration of the image based on the
fixations recorded during recalling the image against a neutral background.
This idea exploits that eye movements are a spatial index into the memory of a
visual stimulus. We perform an experiment in which we record the eye movements
of 30 observers during the presentation and recollection of 100 images. The
locations of fixations during recall are only qualitatively related to the
fixations during exploration. We develop a deformation mapping technique to
align the fixations from recall with the fixation during exploration. This
allows filtering the fixations based on proximity and a threshold on proximity
provides a convenient slider to control the amount of filtering. Analyzing the
spatial histograms resulting from the filtering procedure as well as the set of
removed fixations shows that certain types of scene elements, which could be
considered irrelevant, are removed. In this sense, they provide a measure of

the sphere or in the plane such that any two of the curves are either disjoint
or intersect in exactly two crossing points. We call an arrangement
intersecting if every pair of pseudocircles intersects twice. An arrangement is
circularizable if there is a combinatorially equivalent arrangement of circles.
  In this paper we present the results of the first thorough study of
circularizability. We show that there are exactly four non-circularizable
arrangements of 5 pseudocircles (one of them was known before). In the set of
2131 digon-free intersecting arrangements of 6 pseudocircles we identify the
three non-circularizable examples. We also show non-circularizability of 8
additional arrangements of 6 pseudocircles which have a group of symmetries of
size at least 4.
  Most of our non-circularizability proofs depend on incidence theorems like
Miquel's. In other cases we contradict circularizability by considering a
continuous deformation where the circles of an assumed circle representation
grow or shrink in a controlled way.
  The claims that we have all non-circularizable arrangements with the given
properties are based on a program that generated all arrangements up to a
certain size. Given the complete lists of arrangements, we used heuristics to
find circle representations. Examples where the heuristics failed were examined
by hand.

particularly for biomolecular systems, where direct measurements of individual

this purpose, the choice of the process noise covariance is generally unclear.
In this chapter, we address this issue for biomolecular systems using a
combination of Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data, exploiting the
dependence of the process noise covariance on the states and parameters, as
given in the Langevin framework. We adapt a Hybrid Extended Kalman Filtering
technique by updating the process noise covariance at each time step based on
estimates. We compare the performance of this framework with different fixed
values of process noise covariance in biomolecular system models, including an
oscillator model, as well as in experimentally measured data for a negative
transcriptional feedback circuit. We find that the Extended Kalman Filter with
such process noise covariance update is closer to the optimality condition in
the sense that the innovation sequence becomes white and in achieving a balance
between the mean square estimation error and parameter convergence time. The
results of this chapter may help in the use of Extended Kalman Filters for
systems where process noise covariance depends on states and/or parameters.

solid lithium-ion electrolyte with potential use in all-solid-state lithium-ion
batteries. Interfaces with spinel electrodes, such as Li$_y$Mn$_2$O$_4$ and
Li$_{4+3z}$Ti$_5$O$_{12}$, may be lattice-matched, with potentially low
interfacial resistances. Small lattice parameter differences across a
lattice-matched interface are unavoidable, causing residual epitaxial strain.
This strain potentially modifies lithium diffusion near the interface,
contributing to interfacial resistance. Here we report a density functional
theory study of strain effects on lithium diffusion pathways for
(Li,Al)-co-doped magnesium spinel, for $x_\mathrm{Li} = 0.25$ and
$x_\mathrm{Li} = 0.5$. We have calculated diffusion profiles for the
un-strained materials, and for isotropic and biaxial tensile strains of up to
6%, corresponding to {100} epitaxial interfaces with Li$_y$Mn$_2$O$_4$ and
Li$_{4+3z}$Ti$_5$O$_{12}$. We find that isotropic tensile strain reduces
lithium diffusion barriers by as much as 0.32 eV, with typical barriers reduced
by ~0.1 eV. This effect is associated with increased volumes of transitional
octahedral sites, and broadly follows local electrostatic potentials. For
biaxial (epitaxial) strain changes in octahedral site volumes and in lithium
diffusion barriers are much smaller than under isotropic strain. Typical
barriers are reduced by only ~ 0.05 eV. Individual effects, however, depend on
the pathway considered and the relative strain orientation. These results
predict that isotropic strain strongly affects ionic conductivities in
(Li,Al)-co-doped magnesium spinel electrolytes, and that tensile strain is a
potential route to enhanced lithium transport. For a lattice-matched interface
with candidate spinel-structured electrodes epitaxial strain has a small, but
complex, effect on lithium diffusion barriers.

has transformed industries, daily lives and various scientific disciplines in
recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural
networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly
complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new
and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as
inter-disciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality,
and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to
provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple
technical overview, trans-disciplinary progress update, and a source of
inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various
physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data
challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially
suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data.
Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance
to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a
scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed 'AI neuroscience,' where
scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights,
has been born. This budding sub-discipline has demonstrated methods including
correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features,
reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of
network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition
neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus

the geometrical properties of solutions of the systems to the studying a
probabilistic measure. The cumulant apparatus is suitable for studying the
correlations of dynamical variables, which allows one to reveal the deviation
of the actual probabilistic distribution function from canonical one and to
evaluate it. Three different thermostats, namely the Nos\'e-Hoover,
Patra-Bhatacharya and Hoover-Holian ones, were investigated. It is shown that
their actual distribution functions are non-canonical because of nonlinear
coupling of the oscillators with thermostats. The problem of ergodicity of the
deterministically thermostated systems is discussed.

between its domestic currency and a foreign one. The central bank can purchase
and sell the foreign currency, and each intervention on the exchange market
leads to a proportional cost whose instantaneous marginal value depends on the
current level of the exchange rate. The central bank aims at minimizing the
total expected costs of interventions on the exchange market, plus a total
expected holding cost. We formulate this problem as an infinite time-horizon
stochastic control problem with controls that have paths which are locally of
bounded variation. The exchange rate evolves as a general linearly controlled
one-dimensional diffusion, and the two nondecreasing processes giving the
minimal decomposition of a bounded-variation control model the cumulative
amount of foreign currency that has been purchased and sold by the central
bank. We provide a complete solution to this problem by finding the explicit
expression of the value function and a complete characterization of the optimal
control. At each instant of time, the optimally controlled exchange rate is
kept within a band whose size is endogenously determined as part of the
solution to the problem. We also study the expected exit time from the band,
and the sensitivity of the width of the band with respect to the model's
parameters in the case when the exchange rate evolves (in absence of any
intervention) as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and the marginal costs of
controls are constant. The techniques employed in the paper are those of the
theory of singular stochastic control and of one-dimensional diffusions.

detection manners are evolving from axis-aligned rectangle to rotated rectangle
and further to quadrangle. However, current datasets contain very little curve
text, which can be widely observed in scene images such as signboard, product
name and so on. To raise the concerns of reading curve text in the wild, in
this paper, we construct a curve text dataset named CTW1500, which includes
over 10k text annotations in 1,500 images (1000 for training and 500 for
testing). Based on this dataset, we pioneering propose a polygon based curve
text detector (CTD) which can directly detect curve text without empirical
combination. Moreover, by seamlessly integrating the recurrent transverse and
longitudinal offset connection (TLOC), the proposed method can be end-to-end
trainable to learn the inherent connection among the position offsets. This
allows the CTD to explore context information instead of predicting points
independently, resulting in more smooth and accurate detection. We also propose
two simple but effective post-processing methods named non-polygon suppress
(NPS) and polygonal non-maximum suppression (PNMS) to further improve the
detection accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed approach in this paper is
designed in an universal manner, which can also be trained with rectangular or
quadrilateral bounding boxes without extra efforts. Experimental results on
CTW-1500 demonstrate our method with only a light backbone can outperform
state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. By evaluating only in the curve

for a wide set of problems in Operations Research and related fields. However,
there is still very little known about what can be expressed by small
mixed-integer programs. In particular, prior to this work, it was open whether
some classical problems, like the minimum odd-cut problem, can be expressed by
a compact mixed-integer program with few (even constantly many) integer
variables. This is in stark contrast to linear formulations, where recent
breakthroughs in the field of extended formulations have shown that many
polytopes associated to classical combinatorial optimization problems do not
even admit approximate extended formulations of sub-exponential size.
  We provide a general framework for lifting inapproximability results of
extended formulations to the setting of mixed-integer extended formulations,
and obtain almost tight lower bounds on the number of integer variables needed
to describe a variety of classical combinatorial optimization problems. Among
the implications we obtain, we show that any mixed-integer extended formulation
of sub-exponential size for the matching polytope, cut polytope, traveling
salesman polytope or dominant of the odd-cut polytope, needs $ \Omega(n/\log n)
$ many integer variables, where $ n $ is the number of vertices of the
underlying graph. Conversely, the above-mentioned polyhedra admit
polynomial-size mixed-integer formulations with only $ O(n) $ or $ O(n \log n)
$ (for the traveling salesman polytope) many integer variables.
  Our results build upon a new decomposition technique that, for any convex set
$ C $, allows for approximating any mixed-integer description of $ C $ by the
intersection of $ C $ with the union of a small number of affine subspaces.

focus of much interest. It has recently been pointed out that large individual
active regions with atypical properties can have a significant impact on the
long term behaviour of solar activity. We investigate this possibility in more
detail using a recently developed 2$\times$2D dynamo model of the solar
magnetic cycle. We find that even a single ""rogue"" bipolar magnetic region
(BMR) in the simulations can have a major effect on the further development of
solar activity cycles, boosting or suppressing the amplitude of subsequent
cycles. In extreme cases an individual BMR can completely halt the dynamo,
triggering a grand minimum. Rogue BMRs also have the potential to induce
significant hemispheric asymmetries in the solar cycle. To study the effect of
rogue BMRs in a more systematic manner, a series of dynamo simulations were
conducted, in which a large test BMR was manually introduced in the model at
various phases of cycles of different amplitudes. BMRs emerging in the rising
phase of a cycle can modify the amplitude of the ongoing cycle while BMRs
emerging in later phases will only impact subsequent cycles. In this model, the
strongest impact on the subsequent cycle occurs when the rogue BMR emerges
around cycle maximum at low latitudes but the BMR does not need to be strictly
cross-equatorial. Active regions emerging as far as $20^{\circ}$ from the
equator can still have a significant impact. We demonstrate that the combined
effect of the magnetic flux, tilt angle and polarity separation of the BMR on
the dynamo is via their contribution to the dipole moment, $\delta
D_{\mathrm{BMR}}$. Our results indicate that prediction of the amplitude,
starting epoch and duration of a cycle requires an accurate accounting of a
broad range of active regions emerging in the previous cycle.

Measurements by X-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron spectrometers on the MESSENGER
spacecraft revealed Mercury's surface to have surprisingly high abundances of
the moderately volatile elements sodium, sulfur, potassium, chlorine, and
thorium, and a low abundance of iron. This composition rules out some formation
models for which high temperatures are expected to have strongly depleted
volatiles and indicates that Mercury formed under conditions much more reducing
than the other rocky planets of our Solar System. Through geochemical modeling
and petrologic experiments, the planet's mantle and core compositions can be
estimated from the surface composition and geophysical constraints. The bulk
silicate composition of Mercury is likely similar to that of enstatite or
metal-rich chondrite meteorites, and the planet's unusually large core is most
likely Si rich, implying that in bulk Mercury is enriched in Fe and Si (and
possibly S) relative to the other inner planets. The compositional data for
Mercury acquired by MESSENGER will be crucial for quantitatively testing future
models of the formation of Mercury and the Solar System as a whole, as well as

possible modifications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms aimed at
alleviating the sign problem which appears in many interesting physical
situations, e.g. in the Hubbard model away from half filling. In this approach
one utilizes the fact that the integral over real variables with an integrand
containing a complex fluctuating phase is equivalent to the sum of integrals
over special manifolds in complex space (""Lefschetz thimbles""), each of them
having a fixed complex phase factor. Thus, the sign problem can be reduced if
the resulting sum contains terms with only a few different phases. We explore
the complexity of the sign problem for the few-site Hubbard model on square
lattice combining a semi-analytical study of saddle points and thimbles in
small lattices with several steps in Euclidean time with results of test QMC
calculations. We check different variants of conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation based on Gaussian integrals. On the basis of our analysis we
reveal a regime with minimal number of relevant thimbles in the vicinity of
half filling. In this regime we found only two relevant thimbles for the
few-site lattices studied in the paper. There is also indirect evidence of the
existence of this regime in more realistic systems with large number of
Euclidean time slices. In addition, we derive a new non-Gaussian representation
of the interaction term, where the number of relevant Lefschetz is also reduced

the central first parsecs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Our goal is to study
the required optical depth and composition of different dusty and ionised
structures.
  Methods: We developed a radiative transfer code, MontAGN, optimised for
polarimetric observations in the infrared. With both this code and STOKES,
designed to be relevant from the hard X-ray band to near-infrared wavelengths,
we investigate the polarisation emerging from a characteristic model of the AGN
environment. For that purpose, we compare predictions of our models with
previous infrared observations of NGC 1068, and try to reproduce several key
polarisation patterns revealed by polarisation mapping.
  Results: We constrain the required dust structures as well as their
densities. More precisely, we find out that the electron density inside the
ionisation cone is about $2.0 \times 10^9$ m$^{-3}$ . With structures
constituted of spherical grains of constant density, we also highlight that the
torus should be thicker than 20 in term of K band optical depth to block direct
light from the centre. It should also have a stratification in density, with a
lesser dense outer rim with an optical depth at 2.2 {\mu}m typically between
0.8 and 4 for observing the double scattering effect previously proposed.
  Conclusions: We bring constraints on the dust structures in the inner parsecs
of an AGN model supposed to describe NGC 1068. When compared to observations,
this leads to optical depth of at least 20 in Ks band for the torus of NGC
1068, corresponding to $\tau_V \approx 170$, which is within the range of
current estimation based on observations. In the future, we will improve our
study by including non uniform dust structures and aligned elongated grains to
constrain other possible interpretations of the observations.

the rest mass density and the energy density, respectively, and $\omega$ and

We assume that the charge density $\rho_e$ is proportional to the energy
density $\rho$, $\rho_e = \alpha\, \rho$, with $\alpha$ being a constant such
that $0\leq |\alpha|\leq 1$. Some properties of the charged spheres such as
mass, total electric charge, radius, redshift, and the speed of sound are
analyzed. The dependence of such properties with the polytropic exponent is
also investigated. In addition, some limits that arise in general relativity,
such as the Chandrasekhar limit, the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, the Buchdahl
bound and the Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound, i.e., the Buchdahl bound for the
electric case, are studied. As in a charged non-relativistic polytropic sphere,
the charged relativistic polytropic sphere with $\gamma\to\infty$ and $\alpha
\to 1$ saturates the Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound, thus indicating that it
reaches the quasiblack hole configuration. We show by means of numerical
analysis that, as expected, the major differences between the two cases appear
in the high energy density region.

promising drag reducing method in the maritime industry. Here we utilize the
Taylor-Couette (TC) geometry, i.e. the flow between two concentric,
independently rotating cylinders, to study the effect of air cavities in this
closed setup, which is well-accessible for drag measurements and optical flow
visualizations. We show that stable air cavities can be formed, and that the
cavity size increases with Reynolds number and void fraction. The streamwise
cavity length strongly depends on the axial position due to buoyancy forces
acting on the air. Strong secondary flows, which are introduced by a
counter-rotating outer cylinder, clearly decrease the stability of the
cavities, as air is captured in the Taylor rolls rather than in the cavity.
Surprisingly, we observed that local air injection is not necessary to sustain
the air cavities; as long as air is present in the system it is found to be
captured in the cavity. We show that the drag is decreased significantly as
compared to the case without air, but with the geometric modifications imposed
on the TC system by the cavitators. As the void fraction increases, the drag of
the system is decreased. However, the cavitators itself significantly increase
the drag due to their hydrodynamic resistance (pressure drag): In fact, a net
drag increase is found when compared to the standard smooth-wall TC case.
Therefore, one must first overcome the added drag created by the cavitators
before one obtains a net drag reduction.

Processes, Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (Linear CRF), Tree-Structured

outperform the other sequential classifiers; this performance is consistent

analyses the different features under study, identifying those that best help
characterise and distinguish between stances, such as supporting tweets being
more likely to be accompanied by evidence than denying tweets. We also set

third indicator (Mantel-Haenszel quotient, MHq) belonging to the same indicator

statistics for the comparison of proportions. We test (using citations and

can distinguish between different quality levels as defined on the basis of the
assessments by peers. Thus, we test their convergent validity. We find that the
indicator MHq is able to distinguish between the quality levels in most cases
while MNPC and EMNPC are not. Since the MHq is shown in this study to be a
valid indicator, we apply it to six types of zero-inflated altmetrics data and
test whether different altmetrics sources are related to quality. The results
for the various altmetrics demonstrate that the relationship between altmetrics

strong as the relationship between citations and assessments by peers.
Actually, the relationship between citations and peer assessments is about two

Studying accurate model of popularity is important for quantifying spreading of

similar class of nonlinear differential equation formulates traditional
population dynamics well, part of the deviation in long-term prediction is
stated, yet fully understood. Recently, several studies hinted a long-term
memory effect on popularity whose response function follows a power-law,
especially that appears on online mass media such as YouTube, Twitter, or
Amazon book sales. Here, we investigate the ranking of most popular music,
\textit{the Billboard Hot 100 chart}, which is one of the largest popularity
dataset spanning several decades. Using a popularity model that comprises
logistic growth and a power-law decaying long-term memory, we showed that rank
history is mainly characterized by initial popularity and memory strength. With
this framework, we investigated temporal development of long-term memory on the
whole popularity dynamics. As a result, abrupt emergence of long-term memory
and broad initial popularity is illustrated, which was not clearly detected by
time-independent measures. We emphasize not only development of the mass media,
but also the difference of spreading and accumulated popularity affect dynamics
significantly when the popularity has long-term memory.

the next generation mobile networks. However, existing analysis of UDNs,
including Stochastic Geometry, has not been able to fully determine the
potential gains and limits of densification. In this paper we study performance
of UDNs in downlink and provide new insights on the impact of antenna height
and careful site selection on the network performance. We focus our
investigation on the probability of coverage, average cell rate and average
area spectral efficiency for networks with regular and random BS deployments.
We show that under a path-loss model which considers antenna height there
exists an upper limit on network performance which is dependent on the
path-loss model parameters. Our analysis shows an interesting finding that even
for over-densified networks a non-negligible system performance can be
achieved.

of its abundance in the universe. An alternative to new elementary particles
postulates DM as made of macroscopic compact halo objects (MACHO) such as black
holes formed in the very early universe. Stellar-mass primordial black holes
(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might
be connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). New methods are therefore necessary to
constrain the viability of compact objects as a DM candidate. Here we report
bounds on the abundance of compact objects from gravitational lensing of type
Ia supernovae (SNe). Current SNe datasets constrain compact objects to
represent less than 35.2% (Joint Lightcurve Analisis) and 37.2% (Union 2.1) of
the total matter content in the universe, at 95% confidence-level. The results
are valid for masses larger than $\sim 0.01M_\odot$ (solar-masses), limited by
the size SNe relative to the lens Einstein radius. We demonstrate the mass
range of the constraints by computing magnification probabilities for realistic
SNe sizes and different values of the PBH mass. Our bounds are sensitive to the
total abundance of compact objects with $M \lesssim 0.01M_\odot$ and
complementary to other observational tests. These results are robust against
cosmological parameters, outlier rejection, correlated noise and selection
bias. PBHs and other MACHOs are therefore ruled out as the dominant form of DM
for objects associated to LIGO gravitational wave detections. These bounds
constrain early-universe models that predict stellar-mass PBH production and
strengthen the case for lighter forms of DM, including new elementary
particles.

diverse application domains including computer vision, speech recognition, and
natural language processing. However, as the size of datasets and the depth of
neural network architectures continue to grow, it is imperative to design
high-performance and energy-efficient computing hardware for training CNNs. In
this paper, we consider the problem of designing specialized CPU-GPU based
heterogeneous manycore systems for energy-efficient training of CNNs. It has
already been shown that the typical on-chip communication infrastructures
employed in conventional CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms are
unable to handle both CPU and GPU communication requirements efficiently. To
address this issue, we first analyze the on-chip traffic patterns that arise
from the computational processes associated with training two deep CNN
architectures, namely, LeNet and CDBNet, to perform image classification. By
leveraging this knowledge, we design a hybrid Network-on-Chip (NoC)
architecture, which consists of both wireline and wireless links, to improve
the performance of CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms running the
above-mentioned CNN training workloads. The proposed NoC achieves 1.8x
reduction in network latency and improves the network throughput by a factor of
2.2 for training CNNs, when compared to a highly-optimized wireline mesh NoC.
For the considered CNN workloads, these network-level improvements translate
into 25% savings in full-system energy-delay-product (EDP). This demonstrates
that the proposed hybrid NoC for heterogeneous manycore architectures is
capable of significantly accelerating training of CNNs while remaining
energy-efficient.

  Recommendation","Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been
widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques
mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent
and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode
her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each
candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully
capture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware
user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL.
Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on
their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL
adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature
interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction.
Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit
review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning
and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component,
with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for
a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding
reviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be
comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts
complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of
user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear
fusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL
achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing
state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the
relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating
prediction.

bits. The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input
bits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing

are reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR

on the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode
and correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and
correction, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is
always converted using a binary to BCD converter. The proposed reversible

that the presence of the target object induces small shifts to the resonant
frequencies of the plasmonic particle. These shifts, which can be determined
from the far field data, encodes the contracted generalized polarization
tensors of the target object, from which one can perform reconstruction beyond
the usual resolution limit. The main argument is based on perturbation theory.
However, the same argument is no longer applicable in the strong interaction
regime as considered in this paper due to the large shift induced by strong
field interaction between the particles. We develop a novel technique based on
conformal mapping theory to overcome this difficulty. The key is to design a
conformal mapping which transforms the two particle system into a shell-core
structure, in which the inner dielectric core corresponds to the target object.
We show that a perturbation argument can be used to analyze the shift in the
resonant frequencies due to the presence of the inner dielectric core. This
shift also encodes information of the contracted polarization tensors of the
core, from which one can reconstruct its shape, and hence the target object.
Our theoretical findings are supplemented by a variety of numerical results
based on an efficient optimal control algorithm. The results of this paper make
the mathematical foundation for plasmonic sensing complete.

Indeed, it is a nontrivial task to measure the popularity of job skills due to
the diversified criteria of jobs and the complicated connections within job
skills. To that end, in this paper, we propose a data driven approach for
modeling the popularity of job skills based on the analysis of large-scale
recruitment data. Specifically, we first build a job skill network by exploring
a large corpus of job postings. Then, we develop a novel Skill Popularity based
Topic Model (SPTM) for modeling the generation of the skill network. In
particular, SPTM can integrate different criteria of jobs (e.g., salary levels,
company size) as well as the latent connections within skills, thus we can
effectively rank the job skills based on their multi-faceted popularity.
Extensive experiments on real-world recruitment data validate the effectiveness
of SPTM for measuring the popularity of job skills, and also reveal some
interesting rules, such as the popular job skills which lead to high-paid
employment.

fundamental in electrodynamics, with electric and magnetic fields as quantities
auxiliary to the scalar and vector potentials -- opposite to the conventional
ordering. One foundation for the concept of basic potentials and auxiliary
fields consists of examples where two sets of gauge-related fields are such
that one is physical and the other is erroneous, with the information for the
proper choice supplied by the potentials. A major consequence is that a change
of gauge is not a unitary transformation in quantum mechanics; a principle
heretofore unchallenged. The primacy of potentials over fields leads to the
concept of a hierarchy of physical quantities, where potentials and energies
are primary, while fields and forces are secondary. Secondary quantities
provide less information than do primary quantities. Some criteria by which
strong laser fields are judged are based on secondary quantities, making it
possible to arrive at inappropriate conclusions. This is exemplified by several
field-related misconceptions as diverse as the behavior of charged particles in
very low frequency propagating fields, and the fundamental problem of pair
production at very high intensities. In each case, an approach based on
potentials gives appropriate results, free of ambiguities. The examples
encompass classical and quantum phenomena, in relativistic and nonrelativistic
conditions. This is a major extension of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect,
both in supporting the primacy of potentials over fields, and also in showing
how field-based conceptions can lead to errors in basic applications.

employed to determine the electrical conductivity ({\sigma}) of these
nanocomposites as a function of SWCNT concentration. Then, these {\sigma}
values were used to compute the SE values as a function of frequency and
concentration. Specifically, a pseudo three-dimensional (3D) percolation model
was developed to study the effects of random connectivity of SWCNTs to one
another on the {\sigma} values of the nanocomposites. Both intrinsic and
tunneling resistances were taken into account. The consequences of the presence
of both well-exfoliated and aggregated SWCNTs with varying lengths distributed
inhomogeneously on {\sigma} and SE values were investigated.

of strong/weak bisimulation equivalences and observation congruence, a theory
of congruence for CCS, various versions of ""bisimulation up to"" techniques, and
several deep theorems, namely the ""coarsest congruence contained in weak

  This work is further extended to support recent developments in Concurrency
Theory, namely the ""contraction"" relation and the related ""unique solutions of

As a result, a rather complete theory of ""contraction"" (and a similar relation
called ""expansion"") for CCS is also formalized in this thesis. Further more, a
new variant of contraction called ""observational contraction"" was found by the
author during this work, based on existing contraction relation. It's formally
proved that, this new relation is preserved by direct sums of CCS processes,
and has a more elegant form of the ""unique solutions of contractions"" theorem

However, respondents were willing to shop online if e-Commerce was the only
means of getting their products. Respondents also had a high sense of perceived
vulnerability and their perceived vulnerability to unauthorized data collection
and misuse of personal information could affect Ghanaian e-Commerce platform
adoption. The perceived ability of users of e-Commerce platforms in Ghana to
control data collection and its subsequent use by other third parties was also
found to negatively impact customers willingness to wholly transact and share

radiation is at the basis of wireless communications and power transfer (WPT).
The maximum of transferred energy is ensured when the antenna is conjugately
matched, i.e., when it is resonant and it has an equal coupling with free space
and its load, which is not easily implemented in near-field WPT. Here, we
introduce the concept of coherently enhanced wireless power transfer. We show
that a principle similar to the one underlying the operation of coherent
perfect absorbers can be employed to improve the overall performance of WPT and
potentially achieve its dynamic control. The concept relies on coherent
excitation of the waveguide connected to the antenna load with a backward
propagating signal of specific amplitude and phase. This signal creates a
suitable interference pattern at the load resulting in a modification of the
local wave impedance, which in turn enables conjugate matching and a largely
increased amount of energy extracted to the waveguide. We develop an
illustrative theoretical model describing this concept, demonstrate it with
full-wave numerical simulations for the canonical example of a dipole antenna,
and verify it experimentally in both near-field and far-field regimes.

Advanced communication technology enables a heterogeneous connectivity where
mobile devices broadcast information to everything. Mobile applications such as
robotics and vehicles connecting to cloud and surroundings transfer the
short-range on-board sensor perception system to long-range mobile-sensing
perception system. However, the mobile sensing perception brings new challenges
for how to efficiently analyze and intelligently interpret the deluge of IoT
data in mission- critical services. In this article, we model the challenges as
latency, packet loss and measurement noise which severely deteriorate the
reliability and quality of IoT data. We integrate the artificial intelligence
into IoT to tackle these challenges. We propose a novel architecture that
leverages recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Kalman filtering to anticipate
motions and interac- tions between objects. The basic idea is to learn
environment dynamics by recurrent networks. To improve the robustness of IoT
communication, we use the idea of Kalman filtering and deploy a prediction and
correction step. In this way, the architecture learns to develop a biased
belief between prediction and measurement in the different situation. We
demonstrate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets with noise that
mimics the challenges of IoT communications. Our method brings a new level of
IoT intelligence. It is also lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art
convolutional recurrent architecture and is ideally suitable for the
resource-limited mobile applications.

bitstream perceived quality estimation models based on the Random Forests,
Bagging, Deep Learning and Genetic Programming methods.
  We have taken an empirical approach and have generated models varying from
very simple to the most complex depending on the number of features used from
the quality dataset. Random Forests and Bagging models have overall generated
the most accurate results in terms of RMSE and Pearson correlation coefficient
values. Deep Learning and Genetic Programming based bitstream models have also
achieved good results but that high performance was observed only with a
limited range of features. We have also obtained the epsilon-insensitive RMSE
values for each model and have computed the significance of the difference
between the correlation coefficients.
  Overall we conclude that computing the bitstream information is worth the
effort it takes to generate and helps to build more accurate models for
real-time communications. However, it is useful only for the deployment of the
right algorithms with the carefully selected subset of the features. The
