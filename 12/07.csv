measurement noise or other random sources along with the signal. Usually,
neither the signal nor the noise are accurately known prior to the measurement
so that both have to be estimated a posteriori. We have studied a procedure to
estimate the standard deviation of the stochastic contribution assuming
normality and independence, requiring a sufficiently well-sampled data set to
yield reliable results. This procedure is based on estimating the standard
deviation in a sample of weighted sums of arbitrarily sampled data points and
is identical to the so-called DER_SNR algorithm for specific parameter
settings. To demonstrate the applicability of our procedure, we present
applications to synthetic data, high-resolution spectra, and a large sample of
space-based light curves and, finally, give guidelines to apply the procedure
in situation not explicitly considered here to promote its adoption in data

transition which can be characterized in terms of the free energy of the model:
the free energy is zero in the delocalized phase and it is positive in the
localized phase. This transition, which is observed when tuning the mean $h$ of
the disorder variable, has been tackled in the physics literature notably via a
renormalization group procedure that goes under the name of \emph{strong
disorder renormalization}. We focus on the case $\alpha=0$ -- the critical
value $h_c(\beta)$ of the parameter $h$ is exactly known (for every strength
$\beta$ of the disorder) in this case -- and we provide precise estimates on
the critical behavior. Our results confirm the strong disorder renormalization
group prediction that the transition is of infinite order, namely that when
$h\searrow h_c(\beta)$ the free energy vanishes faster than any power of
$h-h_c(\beta)$. But we show that the free energy vanishes much faster than the

$\kappa$-distribution function. Inside the disk, we assume a thermal

by using the ray tracing code {\tt RAPTOR}, and compare the synthetic
observations to observations of Sgr~A*. Finally, we compare numerical models of

  The parameters of the dust in the starforming regions were determined via
synthetic-spectra fitting, such as the total dust mass, the fraction of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), etc. Comparison of the observed fluxes
with the measured parameters shows that the relationships between atomic
hydrogen, molecular hydrogen, and dust are different in low- and
high-metallicity regions. Low-metallicity regions contain more atomic gas, but
less molecular gas and dust, including PAHs. The mass of dust constitutes about
$1\%$ of the mass of molecular gas in all regions considered. Fluxes produced
by atomic and molecular gas do not correlate with the parameters of the stellar
radiation, whereas the dust fluxes grow with increasing mean intensity of
stellar radiation and the fraction of enhanced stellar radiation. The ratio of
the fluxes at 8 and 24$\mu$m, which characterizes the PAH content, decreases
with increasing intensity of the stellar radiation, possibly indicating
evolutionary variations of the PAH content. The results confirm that the

turbulence in a multi-species, magnetized, pressure-anisotropic plasma.
Turbulent fluctuations are assumed to be small compared to the mean field, to
be spatially anisotropic with respect to it, and to have frequencies small
compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. At scales above the ion Larmor radius,
the theory reduces to the pressure-anisotropic generalization of kinetic
reduced magnetohydrodynamics (KRMHD) formulated by Kunz et al. (2015). At
scales at and below the ion Larmor radius, three main objectives are achieved.
First, we analyse the linear response of the pressure-anisotropic gyrokinetic
system, and show it to be a generalisation of previously explored limits. The
effects of pressure anisotropy on the stability and collisionless damping of
Alfvenic and compressive fluctuations are highlighted, with attention paid to
the spectral location and width of the frequency jump that occurs as Alfven
waves transition into kinetic Alfven waves. Secondly, we derive and discuss a
general free-energy conservation law, which captures both the KRMHD free-energy
conservation at long wavelengths and dual cascades of kinetic Alfven waves and
ion entropy at sub-ion-Larmor scales. We show that non-Maxwellian features in
the distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency
of magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy
amongst the cascade channels. Thirdly, a simple model is used to show that
pressure anisotropy can cause large variations in the ion-to-electron heating
ratio due to the dissipation of Alfvenic turbulence. Our theory provides a
foundation for determining how pressure anisotropy affects the turbulent
fluctuation spectra, the differential heating of particle species, and the
ratio of parallel and perpendicular phase mixing in space and astrophysical
plasmas.

systems of different kinds : queueing and telecommunication networks, random
walks, enumeration of planar lattice walks, etc. Frequently, the object is to
determine the probability generating function of some positive random vector in
$Z\_n^+$. Although the situation n = 1 is more classical, we quote an
interesting non local functional equation which appeared in modelling a divide
and conquer protocol for a muti-access broadcast channel. As for n = 2, we
outline the theory reducing these linear FEs to boundary value problems of
Riemann-Hilbert-Carleman type, with closed form integral solutions. Typical
queueing examples analyzed over the last 45 years are sketched. Furthermore, it
is also sometimes possible to determine the nature of the functions (e.g.,
rational, algebraic, holonomic), as illustrated in a combinatorial context,
where asymptotics are briefly tackled. For general situations (e.g., big jumps,
or n $\ge$ 3), only prospective comments are made, because then no concrete
theory exists.

substantially heated out of thermal equilibrium with the core during an
accretion outburst. The observed subsequent cooling in quiescence (when
accretion has halted) offers a unique opportunity to study the structure and
thermal properties of the crust. Initially crust cooling modelling studies
focussed on transient X-ray binaries with prolonged accretion outbursts (> 1
year) such that the crust would be significantly heated for the cooling to be
detectable. Here we present the results of applying a theoretical model to the
observed cooling curve after a short accretion outburst of only ~10 weeks. In
our study we use the 2010 outburst of the transiently accreting 11 Hz X-ray
pulsar in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Observationally it was found that the
crust in this source was still hot more than 4 years after the end of its short
accretion outburst. From our modelling we found that such a long-lived hot
crust implies some unusual crustal properties such as a very low thermal
conductivity (> 10 times lower than determined for the other crust cooling
sources). In addition, we present our preliminary results of the modelling of
the ongoing cooling of the neutron star in MXB 1659-298. This transient X-ray
source went back into quiescence in March 2017 after an accretion phase of ~1.8
years. We compare our predictions for the cooling curve after this outburst
with the cooling curve of the same source obtained after its previous outburst
which ended in 2001.

  International Conference on Hadron Spectroscopy and Structure (2017)",,"10.22323/1.310.0149",,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurements of the ratio of the elastic form factors of the proton
($\mu_pG_E/G_M$) exhibit a strong discrepancy. Experiments using unpolarized
beams and Rosenbluth separation to determine the form factors have found values
of the ratio approximately consistent with unity over a wide range of $Q^2$,
while polarization transfer experiments suggest that the ratio decreases as a
function of $Q^2$. The most widely-accepted hypothesis to explain this
discrepancy is that hard two-photon exchange (TPE) significantly contributes to
the elastic $ep$ cross section. Hard TPE has been neglected in previous
analyses of electron-proton scattering scattering experiments, in part due to
the fact that there exists no model independent way to calculate the
contribution. The effect of hard TPE may be measured experimentally, however,
via precise determination of the ratio of the electron-proton and
positron-proton elastic cross sections. The OLYMPUS experiment collected more
than 3 fb$^{-1}$ of exclusive $e^- p$ and $e^+ p$ elastic scattering data at
DESY in 2012, and has determined the elastic $\sigma_{e^+p}/\sigma_{e^-p}$

$\epsilon\approx0.4$. This presentation will discuss the OLYMPUS experiment and

microstructure beyond the conventional Stejskal-Tanner family is currently of
broad interest. One such technique, multidimensional diffusion MRI, has been
recently proposed to afford model-free decomposition of diffusion signal
kurtosis into terms originating from either ensemble variance of isotropic
diffusivity or microscopic diffusion anisotropy. This ability rests on the
assumption that diffusion can be described as a sum of multiple Gaussian
compartments, but this is often not strictly fulfilled. The effects of
nongaussian diffusion on single shot isotropic diffusion sequences were first
considered in detail by de Swiet and Mitra in 1996. They showed theoretically
that anisotropic compartments lead to anisotropic time dependence of the
diffusion tensors, which causes the measured isotropic diffusivity to depend on
gradient frame orientation. Here we show how such deviations from the multiple
Gaussian compartments assumption conflates orientation dispersion with ensemble
variance in isotropic diffusivity. Second, we consider additional contributions
to the apparent variance in isotropic diffusivity arising due to
intracompartmental kurtosis. These will likewise depend on gradient frame
orientation. We illustrate the potential importance of these confounds with
analytical expressions, numerical simulations in simple model geometries, and
microimaging experiments in fixed spinal cord using isotropic diffusion
encoding waveforms with 7.5 ms duration and 3000 mT/m maximum amplitude.

equilibrate the system at densities close to full packing. We show that, with
increasing density, the system undergoes two entropy-driven phase transitions
with two broken-symmetry phases. At low densities, the system is in a
disordered phase. As intermediate phases, there is a solid-like sublattice
phase in which one type of particle is preferred over the other and the
particles preferentially occupy one of four sublattices, thus breaking both
particle-symmetry as well as translational invariance. At even higher
densities, the phase is a columnar phase, where the particle-symmetry is
restored, and the particles preferentially occupy even or odd rows along one of
the three directions. This phase has translational order in only one direction,
and breaks rotational invariance. From finite size scaling, we demonstrate that
both the transitions are first order in nature. We also show that the simpler

embedding matrix multiplication into group algebra multiplication, and bounding
$\omega$ in terms of the representation theory of the host group. This
framework is general enough to capture the best known upper bounds on $\omega$
and is conjectured to be powerful enough to prove $\omega = 2$, although
finding a suitable group and constructing such an embedding has remained
elusive. Recently it was shown, by a generalization of the proof of the Cap Set
Conjecture, that abelian groups of bounded exponent cannot prove $\omega = 2$
in this framework, which ruled out a family of potential constructions in the
literature.
  In this paper we study nonabelian groups as potential hosts for an embedding.
We prove two main results:
  (1) We show that a large class of nonabelian groups---nilpotent groups of
bounded exponent satisfying a mild additional condition---cannot prove $\omega
= 2$ in this framework. We do this by showing that the shrinkage rate of powers
of the augmentation ideal is similar to the shrinkage rate of the number of
functions over $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$ that are degree $d$ polynomials;
our proof technique can be seen as a generalization of the polynomial method
used to resolve the Cap Set Conjecture.
  (2) We show that symmetric groups $S_n$ cannot prove nontrivial bounds on
$\omega$ when the embedding is via three Young subgroups---subgroups of the
form $S_{k_1} \times S_{k_2} \times \dotsb \times S_{k_\ell}$---which is a
natural strategy that includes all known constructions in $S_n$.
  By developing techniques for negative results in this paper, we hope to
catalyze a fruitful interplay between the search for constructions proving
bounds on $\omega$ and methods for ruling them out.

from this work. We first show how to check if sparsity is relevant for
modelling a given (fixed size) dataset by using network subsampling to identify
a simple signature of sparsity. We discuss the implications of the (sparse)
exchangeable subsampling theory for test-train dataset splitting; we argue
common approaches can lead to biased results, and we propose a principled

questioned. Application of multiple lossy compressions on images is an
essential part of any image editing pipeline involving lossy compressed images.
This paper aims to address the problem of classifying images based on the
number of JPEG compressions they have undergone, by utilizing deep
convolutional neural networks in DCT domain. The proposed system incorporates a
well designed pre-processing step before feeding the image data to CNN to
capture essential characteristics of compression artifacts and make the system
image content independent. Detailed experiments are performed to optimize
different aspects of the system, such as depth of CNN, number of DCT
frequencies, and execution time. Results on the standard UCID dataset
demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms existing systems for multiple
JPEG compression detection and is capable of classifying more number of
re-compression cycles then existing systems.

recently proposed Froissart-Gribov inversion integral, then allows one to
reconstruct the CFT data of intermediate operators of any spin. We use this
method to compute the anomalous dimensions and OPE coefficients of leading
twist operators. To cubic order in $\epsilon$ the double discontinuity arises
solely from the identity operator and the scalar bilinear operator, making the
computation straightforward. At higher orders the double discontinuity receives
contributions from infinite towers of higher spin operators. At fourth order,
the structure of perturbation theory leads to a proposal in terms of functions
of certain degree of transcendentality, which can then be fixed by symmetries.
This leads to the full determination of the CFT data for leading twist
operators to fourth order.

construct a lifted Markov chain on a graph with $n^2 D(G)$ vertices that mixes

an immediate consequence, for every quantum walk there is a lifted Markov chain

The flow parameter space is extended in the present study, including variations
of the circulation Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 2000 - 200000, where Re =
20000 is the value used in the experiments. The vortex line corresponding to
the trefoil knot is defined using a parametric equation and the Biot-Savart law
is employed to initialize the velocity field. The CvP LES computation displays
a good qualitative match with the experiment. In particular, the vortex
entanglement process is accurately represented as well as the subsequent
separation of the main vortex in two distinct structures - a small and a large
vortex - with different self-advection speeds that have been quantified. The
small vortex propagates faster than the large oscillatory vortex which carries
an important amount of vorticity. The advection velocity of the vortex before
bursting is found to be independent of the Reynolds number. The low Reynolds
number computation leads to a decrease of the separated vortices velocity after
bursting, compared to the higher Reynolds computations. The computation of
energy spectra emphasizes intense energy transfers from large to small scales
during the bursting process. The evolution of volume-averaged enstrophy shows
that the bursting leads to the creation of small scales that are sustained a
long time in the flow, when a sufficiently large Reynolds number is considered
(Re>20000). The low Reynolds number case Re = 2000 hinders the generation of
small scales during the bursting process and yields essentially laminar
dynamics. The onset of background turbulence due to the entanglement process
can be observed at Re = 200000

deformability, strength, and fracturing properties of Marcellus shale were
investigated through an experimental study. Firstly, uniaxial compression,
direct tension, and Brazilian tests were performed on the Marcellus shale
specimens in various bedding plane orientations with respect to loading
directions to measure the static mechanical properties and their anisotropy.
Furthermore, the deformability of Marcellus shale was also studied through
seismic velocity measurements for comparison with the static measurements. The
experimental results revealed that the transversely isotropic model is
applicable for describing the elastic behaviors of Marcellus shale in pure
tension and compression. The elastic properties measured from these two
experiments, however, were not exactly the same. Strength results showed that
differences exist between splitting (Brazilian) and direct tensile strengths,
both of which varied with bedding plane orientations and loading directions and
were associated with different failure modes. Finally, a series of
three-point-bending tests were conducted on specimens of increasing size in
three different principal notch orientations to investigate the fracture
properties of the material. It was found that there exists a significant size
effect on the fracture properties calculated from the measured peak loads and
by using the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) theory. The fracture
properties can be uniquely identified, however, by using Bazant's Size Effect

Those that defect have an evolutionary advantage over cooperators who should
therefore die out. However, spatial structure enables cooperators to survive
through the formation of homogeneous clusters, which is the hallmark of network
reciprocity. Here we go beyond this traditional setup and study the
spatiotemporal dynamics of cooperation in a population of populations. We use
the prisoner's dilemma game as the mathematical model and show that considering
several populations simultaneously give rise to fascinating spatiotemporal
dynamics and pattern formation. Even the simplest assumption that strategies
between different populations are payoff-neutral with one another results in
the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance, where defectors of one
population become prey of cooperators in the other population, and vice versa.
Moreover, if social interactions within different populations are characterized
by significantly different temptations to defect, we observe that defectors in
the population with the largest temptation counterintuitively vanish the
fastest, while cooperators that hang on eventually take over the whole
available space. Our results reveal that considering the simultaneous presence
of different populations significantly expands the complexity of evolutionary
dynamics in structured populations, and it allow us to understand the stability
of cooperation under adverse conditions that could never be bridged by network
reciprocity alone.

difficult to train, what results in a time-consuming and human-involved
development process to use them.
  We consider an alternative training process, named SGAN, in which several
adversarial ""local"" pairs of networks are trained independently so that a
""global"" supervising pair of networks can be trained against them. The goal is
to train the global pair with the corresponding ensemble opponent for improved
performances in terms of mode coverage. This approach aims at increasing the
chances that learning will not stop for the global pair, preventing both to be
trapped in an unsatisfactory local minimum, or to face oscillations often
observed in practice. To guarantee the latter, the global pair never affects
the local ones.
  The rules of SGAN training are thus as follows: the global generator and
discriminator are trained using the local discriminators and generators,
respectively, whereas the local networks are trained with their fixed local
opponent.
  Experimental results on both toy and real-world problems demonstrate that
this approach outperforms standard training in terms of better mitigating mode

a few percent suppression of matter perturbations on all scales below their
free-streaming scale. Such effect is of particular importance as it allows to
constraint the value of the sum of neutrino masses from measurements of the
galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we present the first measurements of the
next higher-order correlation function, the bispectrum, from N-body simulations
that include massive neutrinos as particles. This is the simplest statistics
characterising the non-Gaussian properties of the matter and dark matter halos
distributions. We investigate, in the first place, the suppression due to
massive neutrinos on the matter bispectrum, comparing our measurements with the
simplest perturbation theory predictions, finding the approximation of
neutrinos contributing at quadratic order in perturbation theory to provide a
good fit to the measurements in the simulations. On the other hand, as
expected, a linear approximation for neutrino perturbations would lead to
O($f_{\nu}$) errors on the total matter bispectrum at large scales. We then
attempt an extension of previous results on the universality of linear halo
bias in neutrino cosmologies, to non-linear and non-local corrections finding
consistent results with the power spectrum analysis.

is thought to have been produced during a thermal pulse event $\sim2200$ years
ago. To study the thermal dust emission associated with its circumstellar
material, observations were taken with the Faint Object InfraRed CAMera for the

the infrared emission at these wavelengths were used to study the morphology
and temperature structure of the spatially extended dust emission. Using the
radiative transfer code DUSTY and fitting the spatial profile of the emission,
we find that a geometrically thin dust shell cannot reproduce the observed
spatially resolved emission. Instead, a second dust component in addition to
the shell is needed to reproduce the observed emission. This component, which
lies interior to the dust shell, traces the circumstellar envelope of R Scl. It
is best fit by a density profile with $n \propto r^{\alpha}$ where
$\alpha=0.75^{+0.45}_{-0.25}$ and dust mass of
$M_d=9.0^{+2.3}_{-4.1}\times10^{-6}~M_{\odot}$. The strong departure from an

the presence of interacting s particles leads to remarkable conceptual changes.
It turns out that the presence of H-selfinteractions in the Higgs model is not
the result of SSB on a postulated Mexican hat potential, but solely the
consequence of the implementation of positivity and causality. These principles
(and not the imposed gauge symmetry) account also for the Lie-algebra structure

early Universe models in table-top experiments. We consider a recent proposal
for an analog condensed matter experiment to simulate the relativistic quantum
decay of the false vacuum. In the proposed experiment, two ultra-cold
condensates are coupled via a time-varying radio-frequency field. The relative
phase of the two condensates in this system is approximately described by a
relativistic scalar field with a potential possessing a series of false and
true vacuum local minima. If the system is set up in a false vacuum, it would
then decay to a true vacuum via quantum mechanical tunnelling. Should such an
experiment be realized, it would be possible to answer a number of open
questions regarding non-perturbative phenomena in quantum field theory and
early Universe cosmology. In this paper, we illustrate a possible obstruction:
the time-varying coupling that is invoked to create a false vacuum for the
long-wavelength modes of the condensate leads to a destabilization of shorter
wavelength modes within the system via parametric resonance. We focus on an
idealized setup in which the two condensates have identical properties and
identical background densities. Describing the system by the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE), we use the machinery of Floquet theory to
perform a linear stability analysis, calculating the wavenumber associated with
the first instability band for a variety of experimental parameters. However,
we demonstrate that, by tuning the frequency of the time-varying coupling, it
may be possible to push the first instability band outside the validity of the
GPE, where dissipative effects are expected to damp any instabilities. This
provides a viable range of experimental parameters to perform analog
experiments of false vacuum decay.

complementary to our recent work (arXiv:1709.06091) where the electron spectral
function was computed directly using an instanton-based approach. Our results
show that the experimental observation cannot be understood within conventional
theories of the tunneling anomaly, in which the spreading of the injected
charge is driven by the mean-field Coulomb energy. However, we identify a
qualitatively new regime, in which the mean-field Coulomb energy is effectively
quenched and the tunneling anomaly is dominated by the finite compressibility
of the composite Fermion liquid.

\textit{Gaia}/DR1, providing reliable age estimates with relative uncertainties
of $\pm1-2$ Gyr and allowing precise orbital determinations. The sample is
split based on chemistry into a low-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often
identified as thin disk stellar populations, and a high-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which
are often associated with the thick disk. We find that the high-[Mg/Fe]
chemical sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr and is coeval
with the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and
high-[Mg/Fe] sequences were forming stars at the same time. The high-[Mg/Fe]
stellar populations are only vertically extended for the oldest, most-metal
poor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing vertical velocity dispersion for
both sequences, the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower velocity dispersion than
the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age. Identifying either group as
thin or thick disk based on chemistry is misleading. The stars belonging to the
high-[Mg/Fe] sequence have perigalacticons that originate in the inner disk,
while the perigalacticons of stars on the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence are generally
around the solar neighborhood. From the orbital properties of the stars, the
high-and low-[Mg/Fe] sequences are most likely a reflection of the chemical
enrichment history of the inner and outer disk populations; radial mixing
causes both populations to be observed in situ at the solar position. Based on
these results, we emphasize that it is important to be clear in defining what
populations are being referenced when using the terms thin and thick disk, and
that ideally the term thick disk should be reserved for purely geometric
definitions to avoid confusion and be consistent with definitions in external
galaxies.

canonical suite of relativistically broadened emission line models (developed
for black holes) to discs around neutron stars is evaluated. These models were
found to describe well emission lines from neutron star accretion discs unless
the neutron star radius is larger than the innermost stable orbit of the
accretion disc at 6rg or the disc is viewed at high inclination, above 60deg
where shadowing of the back side of the disc becomes important. Theoretical
emissivity profiles were computed for accretion discs illuminated by hotspots

the hot, spherical star surface and in all cases, the emissivity profile of the
accretion disc was found to be well represented by a single power law falling
off slightly steeper than r^-3. Steepening of the emissivity index was found
where the emission is close to the disc plane and the disc can appear truncated
when illuminated by a hotspot at high latitude. The emissivity profile of the
accretion disc in Serpens X-1 was measured and found to be consistent with a
single unbroken power law with index q=3.5 (-0.4,+0.3), suggestive of

core-collapse supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Despite a
very short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easily
detects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts in
each. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectral
resolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission is
dominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Fe
emission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMC
interstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if a
weakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates
(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that these
ejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S K
velocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISM
material. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows the
He-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing the
outer shell. The results also show that even with a very small number of
counts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected in
extended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the very
low SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, such
results are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similar
instruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imaging
observations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomi
and will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray Astronomy
Recovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.

luminosities and redshifts, the sample-averaged lag decreases in the order of
\MgII, \halpha, \hbeta\ and \HeII. This decrease in lags is accompanied by an
increase in the mean line width of the four lines, and is roughly consistent
with the virialized motion for BLR gas in photoionization equilibrium. These
are among the first RM measurements of stratified BLR structure at $z>0.3$.
Dividing our sample by luminosity, \halpha\ shows clear evidence of increasing
lags with luminosity, consistent with the expectation from the measured BLR
size-luminosity relation based on \hbeta. The other three lines do not show a
clear luminosity trend in their average lags due to the limited dynamic range
of luminosity probed and the poor average correlation signals in the divided
samples, a situation that will be improved with the incorporation of additional
photometric and spectroscopic data from SDSS-RM. We discuss the utility and
caveats of composite-lag measurements for large statistical quasar samples with

accretion.The standing shock can become unstable in 2D or 3D; this is called
the {\em standing accretion shock instability} (SASI).Two mechanisms --
advective-acoustic and purely acoustic -- have been proposed to explain SASI.
Using axisymmetric hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations,
we find that the advective-acoustic mechanism better matches the observed
oscillation timescales in our simulations. The global shock oscillations
present in the accretion flow can explain many observed high frequency
($\gtrsim 100$ Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in X-ray binaries (XRBs).
The presence of a moderately strong magnetic field adds more features to the
shock oscillation pattern, giving rise to low frequency modulation in the
computed light curve. This low frequency modulation can be responsible for
$\sim 100$ Hz QPOs (known as hHz QPOs). We propose that the appearance of hHz
QPO determines the separation of twin peak QPOs of higher frequencies.

subtraction can be expressed as a set of counter terms that are introduced by
redefining the bare parameters of the action. Our representation of adiabatic
subtraction then allows us to easily find other renormalization prescriptions
differing only in the finite parts of the counter terms. As our main result, we
present for quadratic inflation how one may consistently express the
renormalization of the spectrum of perturbations from inflation as a
redefinition of the bare cosmological constant and Planck mass such that the
observable predictions coincide with the unrenormalized result.

explained if dust grains have grown by a factor of 75 in grain size, indicating
that by the Class II stage, at a few Myr, a significant amount of dust grain

applied to general regression problems, as well as problems involving
stationary time series. However, with long time series, e.g. annual temperature
measurements spanning over 100 years or daily financial returns spanning
several years, it may be unrealistic to assume stationarity throughout the span
of the dataset. In the paper at hand, we show how Model-free Prediction can be
applied to handle time series that are only locally stationary, i.e., they can
be assumed to be as stationary only over short time-windows. Surprisingly there
is little literature on point prediction for general locally stationary time
series even in model-based setups and there is no literature on the
construction of prediction intervals of locally stationary time series. We
attempt to fill this gap here as well. Both one-step-ahead point predictors and
prediction intervals are constructed, and the performance of model-free is
compared to model-based prediction using models that incorporate a trend and/or
heteroscedasticity. Both aspects of the paper, model-free and model-based, are
novel in the context of time-series that are locally (but not globally)
stationary. We also demonstrate the application of our Model-based and
Model-free prediction methods to speleothem climate data which exhibits local
stationarity and show that our best model-free point prediction results

that communicate each other to fulfill a particular task. In this paper, we
emphasize on the networks whose deployments admit lower dimensional
substructures, such as collinear groups in 2D, or coplanar groups in 3D. When
these groups are given as a part of the input, we describe an algorithm to
utilize this information to perform a low-cost localization. In emergency
situations such as fire, earthquake etc. inside a building, wireless sensor
networks might be very crucial to provide critical information and help the
rescue teams to move very quickly by decreasing their burden of exploring the
environment. Thus, it is very important to develop a system that provides
information quickly and without consuming too much energy. We observe that in
these type of environments, sensor nodes tend to form hyperplanar groups. A
hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than its ambient space, and
accordingly, a hyperplanar group of sensor nodes is a group of nodes that sit
on the same hyperplane. When we consider a floor of a building, the nodes can
be deployed on the corridors to form collinear groups, and when we consider the
whole building, the sensor nodes will sit on the floors to form coplanar
groups. Therefore, we study range-based WSN localization problem in 3D
environments that induce hyperplanar groupings. First, we show that it is an
\NP-hard problem to obtain hyperplanar groups, even if we are given the
equations of the hyperplanes. Then, we describe an algorithm that assumes each
sensor node is aware of its hyperplanar group, and performs a localization when
the sensor nodes are deployed in the corridors on each floor of a building. In
this case, grouping information allows us to localize a network, which cannot
be localized by conventional range-based localization algorithms.

of holomorphic factorization in noncommutative twistor space and gauge
functions. In interpreting the solutions in terms of Fronsdal-type fields in

Klein-Gordon equation with conformal mass in (anti) de Sitter space. We
interpret the FRW solution with de Sitter asymptotics in the context of

characteristic of pulsars with high spin-down power. Their steeply rising hard
X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggest peaks at 0.1 - 1 MeV but
they have not been detected above 200 keV. Several upcoming and planned
telescopes may shed light on the MeV pulsars. The Neutron star Interior

may discover additional MeV pulsars. Planned telescopes, such as All-Sky

model for the spectrum and polarization of MeV pulsars where the X-ray emission
comes from electron- positron pairs radiating in the outer magnetosphere and
current sheet. This model predicts that the peak of the SED increases with
surface magnetic field strength if the pairs are produced in polar cap
cascades. For small inclination angles, a range of viewing angles can miss both
the radio pulse and the GeV pulse from particles accelerating near the current
sheet. Characterizing the emission and geometry of MeV pulsars can thus provide
clues to the source of pairs and acceleration in the magnetosphere.

appealing to extensions of the standard model of cosmology and/or untreated

carefully-calibrated cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which thus
capture the back reaction of the baryons on the total matter distribution. We
have extended the BAHAMAS simulations to include a treatment of massive
neutrinos, which currently represents the best motivated extension to the

conclude that: i) in general there is tension between the primary CMB and LSS
when adopting the standard model with minimal neutrino mass; ii) after
calibrating feedback processes to match the gas fractions of clusters, the
remaining uncertainties in the baryonic physics modelling are insufficient to
reconcile this tension; and iii) if one accounts for internal tensions in the
Planck CMB dataset (by allowing the lensing amplitude, A_Lens, to vary),
invoking a non-minimal neutrino mass, typically of 0.2-0.4 eV, can resolve the
tension. This solution is fully consistent with separate constraints from the

less is known about estimating the error variance in this context. In this
paper, we propose the natural lasso estimator for the error variance, which
maximizes a penalized likelihood objective. A key aspect of the natural lasso
is that the likelihood is expressed in terms of the natural parameterization of
the multiparameter exponential family of a Gaussian with unknown mean and
variance. The result is a remarkably simple estimator of the error variance
with provably good performance in terms of mean squared error. These
theoretical results do not require placing any assumptions on the design matrix
or the true regression coefficients. We also propose a companion estimator,
called the organic lasso, which theoretically does not require tuning of the
regularization parameter. Both estimators do well empirically compared to
preexisting methods, especially in settings where successful recovery of the
true support of the coefficient vector is hard. Finally, we show that existing
methods can do well under fewer assumptions than previously known, thus
providing a fuller story about the problem of estimating the error variance in

polynomial case, in terms of certain hook-lengths in a Ferrers' diagram). We
show that, surprisingly, the extra determinant is related to the partition
function of the 6-vertex model. We give, as a conjecture, the Pieri rules for
the Macdonald polynomials in superspace.

modes, and implement this formalism using the GYRE oscillation code and the
MESASTAR stellar evolution code. Focusing first on a $4.21$ $M_\odot$ model, we
simulate 1,000 years of stellar evolution under the combined effects of the
torque due to a single unstable prograde g mode (with an amplitude chosen on
the basis of observational constraints), and diffusive angular momentum
transport due to convection, overshooting, and rotational instabilities.
  We find that the g mode rapidly extracts angular momentum from the surface
layers, depositing it deeper in the stellar interior. The angular momentum
transport is so efficient that by the end of the simulation the initially
non-rotating surface layers are spun in the retrograde direction to
$\approx30\%$ of the critical rate. However, the additional inclusion of
magnetic stresses in our simulations, almost completely inhibits this spin-up.
  Expanding our simulations to cover the whole instability strip, we show that
the same general behavior is seen in all SPB stars. After providing some
caveats to contextualize our results, we hypothesize that the observed slower
surface rotation of SPB stars (as compared to other B-type stars) may be the
direct consequence of the angular momentum transport that our simulations
demonstrate.

has exploited using a set of global and patch based dictionary priors. In this
paper, we propose a global prior to improve both the speed and quality of
tomographic reconstruction within a Compressive Sensing framework.
  We choose a set of potential representative 2D images referred to as
templates, to build an eigenspace; this is subsequently used to guide the
iterative reconstruction of a similar slice from sparse acquisition data. Our

high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be
merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared
selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and
less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured
AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}_{-12}$%
vs. 9$^{+5}_{-2}$%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}_{-13}$% vs. 17$^{+6}_{-4}$%) and
are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}_{-9}$% vs.
77$^{+4}_{-6}$%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely
than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}_{-13}$% vs. 31$^{+6}_{-6}$%) to be classified
either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host
galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which
potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that
while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert
luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the
triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.

minor bodies (SSOs), whose inter-frame shifts in series of CCD-frames during

These objects have velocities of apparent motion between CCD-frames not
exceeding three RMS errors ($3\sigma$) of measurements of their positions.
About 15\% of objects have a near-zero apparent motion in CCD-frames, including
the objects beyond the Jupiter's orbit as well as the asteroids heading
straight to the Earth.
  The proposed method for detection of the object's near-zero apparent motion
in series of CCD-frames is based on the Fisher f-criterion instead of using the
traditional decision rules that are based on the maximum likelihood criterion.
We analyzed the quality indicators of detection of the object's near-zero
apparent motion applying statistical and in situ modeling techniques in terms
of the conditional probability of the true detection of objects with a
near-zero apparent motion.
  The efficiency of method being implemented as a plugin for the Collection
Light Technology (CoLiTec) software for automated asteroids and comets
detection has been demonstrated. Among the objects discovered with this plugin,
there was the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON). Within 26 minutes of the
observation, the comet's image has been moved by three pixels in a series of
four CCD-frames (the velocity of its apparent motion at the moment of discovery
was equal to 0.8 pixels per CCD-frame; the image size on the frame was about
five pixels). Next verification in observations of asteroids with a near-zero
apparent motion conducted with small telescopes has confirmed an efficiency of
the method even in bad conditions (strong backlight from the full Moon). So, we
recommend applying the proposed method for series of observations with four or

under transcritical conditions using DNS of turbulent channel flows. A fully
compressible solver is used in conjunction with a Peng-Robinson real-fluid
equation of state to describe the transcritical flows. A channel flow with two
isothermal walls is simulated with one heated and one cooled boundary layers.
The grid resolution adopted in this study is slightly finer than that required
for DNS of incompressible channel flows. The simulations are conducted using
both fully (FC) and quasi-conservative (QC) schemes to assess their performance

statistics are analyzed and compared with the canonical theories. It is found

types, namely fully conservative and quasi-conservative schemes. An adaptive
scheme which is a hybrid of the two is developed in this study. By considering

distinctly different mixing behaviors. It is shown that the mixing processes
follow the isobaric-adiabatic and isobaric-isochoric mixing models for fully

mixing behavior that spans both models. The distinct mixing behaviors are a

temperature anisotropies in the CMB. However, inflation also makes predictions
for a CMB B-mode polarization, which has not been detected. Moreover, the
standard inflationary paradigm is unable to accommodate the evolution from the
initial state, which is assumed to be symmetric, into a non-symmetric
aftermath. In Phys. Rev. D 96, 101301(R), we show that the incorporation of an
element capable of explaining such a transition drastically changes the
prediction for the shape and size of the B-mode spectrum. In particular,
employing a realistic objective collapse model in a well-defined semiclassical
context, we find that, while predictions of temperature anisotropies are nor
altered (with respect to standard predictions), the B-mode spectrum gets
strongly suppressed--in accordance with observations. Here we present an
in-depth discussion of that analysis, together with the details of the
calculation.

  Communication Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Communication technology is a major contributor to our lifestyles. Improving
the performance of communication system brings with various benefits to human
beings. This report covers two typical such systems: wireless sensor networks
and cellular networks. We study the influence of mobility in these networks. In
wireless sensor networks, we consider the usage of mobile sinks to collect
sensory data from static nodes. For the latter case, we design data collection
protocols for a single mobile sink which aim at balancing the energy
consumption among sensor nodes to improve the network lifetime. We also design
an algorithm for multiple mobile sinks to collect urgent sensory information
within the allowed latency. Regarding the mobility in cellular networks, we
mean the service providers are mobile. Conventional approaches usually consider
how to optimally deploy static base stations according to a certain metric,
such as throughput. Base station densification is a solution, but it is not
cost efficient. Introducing mobility is to let the base stations fly in the
sky, resulting in less investment. We consider one of the key issues of using
drones to serve cellular users: drone deployment. We have implemented all the
proposed algorithms by either simulations or experiments, and the results have
confirmed the effectiveness of these approaches.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.SY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well established that humans decision making and instrumental control
uses multiple systems, some which use habitual action selection and some which
require deliberate planning. Deliberate planning systems use predictions of
action-outcomes using an internal model of the agent's environment, while
habitual action selection systems learn to automate by repeating previously
rewarded actions. Habitual control is computationally efficient but may be
inflexible in changing environments. Conversely, deliberate planning may be
computationally expensive, but flexible in dynamic environments. This paper
proposes a general architecture comprising both control paradigms by
introducing an arbitrator that controls which subsystem is used at any time.
This system is implemented for a target-reaching task with a simulated
two-joint robotic arm that comprises a supervised internal model and deep
reinforcement learning. Through permutation of target-reaching conditions, we
demonstrate that the proposed is capable of rapidly learning kinematics of the
system without a priori knowledge, and is robust to (A) changing environmental
reward and kinematics, and (B) occluded vision. The arbitrator model is
compared to exclusive deliberate planning with the internal model and exclusive
habitual control instances of the model. The results show how such a model can
harness the benefits of both systems, using fast decisions in reliable
circumstances while optimizing performance in changing environments. In
addition, the proposed model learns very fast. Finally, the system which
includes internal models is able to reach the target under the visual
occlusion, while the pure habitual system is unable to operate sufficiently
under such conditions.

technique to compute scattering and radiation from large arrays of complex
scatterers and antennas. In the proposed technique, each element of the array
is replaced by an equivalent electric current distribution on a fictitious

is derived using the equivalence theorem and it is related to the surface
currents on the scatterer by the Stratton-Chu formulation. With the proposed
approach, instead of directly solving for the unknown surface current density
on the scatterers, we only need to solve for the unknowns on the equivalent
surface. This approach leads to a reduction in the number of unknowns and
better conditioning when it is applied to problems involving complex scatterers
with multiscale features. Furthermore, the proposed approach is accelerated
with the adaptive integral equation method to solve large problems. As
illustrated in several practical examples, the proposed method yields speed up
of up to 20 times and consumes up to 12 times less memory than the standard

reduction using projections of the design matrix. The former approach can be

strategies to boost performance. In particular, we propose to use information
from independent screening to order the inclusion probabilities of the features

the same behavior as the original DF model, that is, it predicts among other
things that the social power ranking among individuals is asymptotically equal
to their centrality ranking, that social power tends to accumulate at the top
of the centrality ranking hierarchy, and that an autocratic (resp., democratic)
power structure arises when the centrality scores are maximally nonuniform

single-timescale DF model behaves differently from the original DF model in two
ways. First, an individual, who corresponds to a reducible node in a reducible
influence network, can keep all social power in the single-timescale DF model
if the initial condition does so, whereas its social power asymptotically
vanishes in the original DF model. Second, when the associated network has
multiple sinks, the two models behave very differently: the original DF model
has a single globally-attractive equilibrium, whereas any partition of social
power among the sinks is allowable at equilibrium in the single-timescale DF

fundamental reason why infall and disk accretion need to be instantaneously
identical. Indeed, even within the disk it might be anticipated that there are

cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution. Japanese infrared satellite,
AKARI, provided unique data sets to probe this both at low and high redshift;
the AKARI all sky survey in 6 bands (9-160 $\mu$m), and the AKARI NEP survey in
9 bands (2-24$\mu$m). The AKARI performed all sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18,
65, 90, 140, and 160 $\mu$m) with 3-10 times better sensitivity than IRAS,
covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission.
Combined with a better spatial resolution, we measure the total infrared
luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared
luminosity density of the local Universe much more precisely than previous
work. In the AKARI NEP wide field, AKARI has obtained deep images in the
mid-infrared (IR), covering 5.4 deg$^2$. However, our previous work was limited
to the central area of 0.25 deg$^2$ due to the lack of deep optical coverage.
To rectify the situation, we used the newly advent Subaru telescope's Hyper
Suprime-Cam to obtain deep optical images over the entire 5.4 deg$^2$ of the
AKARI NEP wide field.
  With this deep and wide optical data, we, for the first time, can use the
entire AKARI NEP wide data to construct restframe 8$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m, and total
infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2. A continuous 9-band
filter coverage in the mid-IR wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and
24$\mu$m) by the AKARI satellite allowed us to estimate restframe 8$\mu$m and
12$\mu$m luminosities without using a large extrapolation based on a SED fit,
which was the largest uncertainty in previous work. By combining these two
results, we reveal dust-hidden cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution
from z=0 to z=2.2, all probed by the AKARI satellite.

neural networks for Markov decision process with large state space and
off-policy reinforcement learning. In contrast to the popular Q-learning and
actor-critic methods that are based on successive approximations to the
nonlinear Bellman equation, our method makes primal-dual updates to the policy
and value functions utilizing the fundamental linear Bellman duality. Naive
parametrization of the primal-dual $\pi$ learning method using deep neural
networks would encounter two major challenges: (1) each update requires
computing a probability distribution over the state space and is intractable;
(2) the iterates are unstable since the parameterized Lagrangian function is no
longer linear. We address these challenges by proposing a relaxed Lagrangian
formulation with a regularization penalty using the advantage function. We show
that the dual policy update step in our method is equivalent to the policy
gradient update in the actor-critic method in some special case, while the
value updates differ substantially. The main advantage of the primal-dual $\pi$
learning method lies in that the value and policy updates are closely coupled
together using the Bellman duality and therefore more informative. Experiments
on a simple cart-pole problem show that the algorithm significantly outperforms
the one-step temporal-difference actor-critic method, which is the most
relevant benchmark method to compare with. We believe that the primal-dual
updates to the value and policy functions would expedite the learning process.
The proposed methods might open a door to more efficient algorithms and sharper
theoretical analysis.

which are indistinguishable from the reliable ones. The reliable robots need to
gather, i.e., arrive to a configuration in which at the same time, all of them
occupy the same point on the plane. The robots are equipped with GPS devices
and at the beginning of the gathering process they communicate the Cartesian
coordinates of their respective positions to the central authority. On the
basis of this information, without the knowledge of which robots are faulty,
the central authority designs a trajectory for every robot. The central
authority aims to provide the trajectories which result in the shortest
possible gathering time of the healthy robots. The efficiency of a gathering
strategy is measured by its competitive ratio, i.e., the maximal ratio between
the time required for gathering achieved by the given trajectories and the
optimal time required for gathering in the offline case, i.e., when the faulty
robots are known to the central authority in advance. The role of the byzantine
robots, controlled by the adversary, is to act so that the gathering is delayed
and the resulting competitive ratio is maximized.
  The objective of our paper is to propose efficient algorithms when the
central authority is aware of an upper bound on the number of byzantine robots.
We give optimal algorithms for collections of robots known to contain at most
one faulty robot. When the proportion of byzantine robots is known to be less
than one half or one third, we provide algorithms with small constant
competitive ratios. We also propose algorithms with bounded competitive ratio
in the case where the proportion of faulty robots is arbitrary.

However, to the best of our knowledge there has been no consideration for
interval estimation when the data are available in grouped format. Motivated by
this, we introduce several methods to obtain confidence intervals for quantiles
when only grouped data is available. Our preferred method for interval
estimation is to approximate the underlying density using the Generalized
Lambda Distribution (GLD) to both estimate the quantiles and variance of the
quantile estimators. We compare the GLD method with some other methods that we
also introduce which are based on a frequency approximation approach and a
linear interpolation approximation of the density. Our methods are strongly
supported by simulations showing that excellent coverage can be achieved for a
wide number of distributions. These distributions include highly-skewed
distributions such as the log-normal, Dagum and Singh-Maddala distributions. We
also apply our methods to real data and show that inference can be carried out
on published outcomes that have been summarized only by a histogram. Our
methods are therefore useful for a broad range of applications. We have also
created a web application that can be used to conveniently calculate the
estimators.

  Shadow Detection and Shadow Removal",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding shadows from a single image spontaneously derives into two
types of task in previous studies, containing shadow detection and shadow
removal. In this paper, we present a multi-task perspective, which is not
embraced by any existing work, to jointly learn both detection and removal in
an end-to-end fashion that aims at enjoying the mutually improved benefits from
each other. Our framework is based on a novel STacked Conditional Generative
Adversarial Network (ST-CGAN), which is composed of two stacked CGANs, each
with a generator and a discriminator. Specifically, a shadow image is fed into
the first generator which produces a shadow detection mask. That shadow image,
concatenated with its predicted mask, goes through the second generator in
order to recover its shadow-free image consequently. In addition, the two
corresponding discriminators are very likely to model higher level
relationships and global scene characteristics for the detected shadow region
and reconstruction via removing shadows, respectively. More importantly, for
multi-task learning, our design of stacked paradigm provides a novel view which
is notably different from the commonly used one as the multi-branch version. To
fully evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we construct the
first large-scale benchmark with 1870 image triplets (shadow image, shadow mask
image, and shadow-free image) under 135 scenes. Extensive experimental results
consistently show the advantages of ST-CGAN over several representative
state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale publicly available datasets and our
newly released one.

that argumentative relations can reasonably be represented with a small set of
predefined patterns. For example, using value judgment and bipolar causality,
we can explain a support relation between two argumentative segments as
follows: Segment 1 states that something is good, and Segment 2 states that it
is good because it promotes something good when it happens. We are motivated by
the following questions: (i) how do we formulate the task?, (ii) can a
reasonable pattern set be created?, and (iii) do the patterns work? To examine
the task feasibility, we conduct a three-stage, detailed annotation study using
357 argumentative relations from the argumentative microtext corpus, a small,
but highly reliable corpus. We report the coverage of explanations captured by
our patterns on a test set composed of 270 relations. Our coverage result of
74.6% indicates that argumentative relations can reasonably be explained by our
small pattern set. Our agreement result of 85.9% shows that a reasonable
inter-annotator agreement can be achieved. To assist with future work in
computational argumentation, the annotated corpus is made publicly available.

curvature $\kappa$, abelian groups are identically flat, and in the other

the study of the chiral magnetic effect in QCD matter. Naively, in pA
collisions one expects no correlation between the orientation of event plane as
reconstructed from the azimuthal distribution of produced hadrons and the
orientation of magnetic field. If this is the case, any charge-dependent hadron
correlations can only result from the background. Nevertheless, in this paper
we point out that in high multiplicity pA collisions a correlation between the
magnetic field and the event plane can appear. This is because triggering on
the high hadron multiplicity amounts to selecting Fock components of the
incident proton with a large number of partons that are expected to have a
transverse size much larger than the average proton size. We introduce the
effect of the fluctuating proton size in the Monte Carlo Glauber model and
evaluate the resulting correlation between the magnetic field and the
second-order event plane in both pA and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions. The
fluctuating proton size is found to result in a significant correlation between
magnetic field and the event plane in pA collisions, even though the magnitude
of the correlation is still much smaller than in AA collisions. This result
opens a possibility of studying the chiral magnetic effect in small systems.

paper offers a novel and mathematical rigorous perspective on the role of the

state, a common feature is the localization of single excitation, which means
the spontaneous emission of excitation into reservoir is prohibited.
Exceptionally the pseudo-bound state can always be found, for which the single
excitation has a finite probability emitted into reservoir. We argue that under
limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ the pseudo-bound bound state characterizes an
equilibrium between the localization in spin chain and spontaneous emission
into reservoir. In addition, a critical energy scale for bound states is also
identified, below which only one bound state exists and it also is pseudo-bound
state. The effect of quasirandom disorder is also discussed. It is found in
this case that the single excitation is more inclined to locate at some spin
sites. Thus a many-body-localization like behavior can be found. In order to
display the effect of bound state and disorder on the preservation of quantum
information, the time evolution of single excitation in spin chain studied
exactly by numerically solving the evolution equation. A striking observation
is that the excitation can be stayed at its initial location with a probability
more than 0.9 when the bound state and disorder coexist. However if any one of
the two issues is absent, the information of initial state can be erased
completely or becomes mixed. Our finding shows that the combination of bound

studied by dint of the variational approximation and systematic simulations.
For solitons in the semi-infinite gap, well-defined stability patterns are
produced under the action of the attractive nonlinearity, clearly exhibiting
the presence of resonance frequencies. The analysis is reported for several
time-modulation formats, including the case of in-phase modulations of both
quasi-1D sublattices, which build the 2D square-shaped OL, and setups with
asynchronous modulation of the sublattices. In particular, when the modulations
of two sublattices are phase-shifted by {\delta}={\pi}/2, the stability map is
not improved, as the originally well-structured stability pattern becomes fuzzy
and the stability at high modulation frequencies is considerably reduced. Mixed
results are obtained for anti-phase modulations of the sublattices
({\delta}={\pi}), where extended stability regions are found for low modulation
frequencies, but for high frequencies the stability is weakened. The analysis
is also performed in the case of the repulsive nonlinearity, for solitons in

partly due to the much smaller amount number of thermal imagery data collected

very strong face recognition models trained using VLD data into the thermal

existence of the domain gap between the thermal and VLD images. To this end, we
propose a Thermal-to-Visible Generative Adversarial Network (TV-GAN) that is
able to transform thermal face images into their corresponding VLD images
whilst maintaining identity information which is sufficient enough for the
existing VLD face recognition models to perform recognition. Some examples are
presented in Figure 1. Unlike the previous methods, our proposed TV-GAN uses an
explicit closed-set face recognition loss to regularize the discriminator
network training. This information will then be conveyed into the generator
network in the forms of gradient loss. In the experiment, we show that by using
this additional explicit regularization for the discriminator network, the
TV-GAN is able to preserve more identity information when translating a thermal

the Ramsey-type results where the number of colors is not finite. This marked
the birth of the so-called canonizing Ramsey theory. In 1985 Pr\""omel and Voigt
made the first step towards the structural canonizing Ramsey theory when they
proved the canonical Ramsey property for the class of finite linearly ordered
hypergraphs, and the subclasses thereof defined by forbidden substructures.
Building on their results in this paper we provide several new structural
canonical Ramsey results. We prove the canonical Ramsey theorem for the class
of all finite linearly ordered tournaments, the class of all finite posets with
linear extensions and the class of all finite linearly ordered metric spaces.
We conclude the paper with the canonical version of the celebrated
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\""odl Theorem. In contrast to the ""classical""
Ramsey-theoretic approach, in this paper we advocate the use of category theory
to manage the complexity of otherwise technically overwhelming proofs typical
in canonical Ramsey theory.

for the convergence rate of the true posterior distribution, and the second

novel prior mass condition, under which the variational approximation error of

determining whether the studied semigroup is symmetric, or finding explicit

tools in tasks that range from check reading to medical diagnosis, reaching
close to human perception, and in some cases surpassing it. However, the
problems to solve are becoming larger and more complex, which translates to
larger CNNs, leading to longer training times that not even the adoption of
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) could keep up to. This problem is partially
solved by using more processing units and distributed training methods that are
offered by several frameworks dedicated to neural network training. However,
these techniques do not take full advantage of the possible parallelization
offered by CNNs and the cooperative use of heterogeneous devices with different
processing capabilities, clock speeds, memory size, among others. This paper
presents a new method for the parallel training of CNNs that can be considered
as a particular instantiation of model parallelism, where only the
convolutional layer is distributed. In fact, the convolutions processed during
training (forward and backward propagation included) represent from $60$-$90$\%
of global processing time. The paper analyzes the influence of network size,
bandwidth, batch size, number of devices, including their processing
capabilities, and other parameters. Results show that this technique is capable
of diminishing the training time without affecting the classification
performance for both CPUs and GPUs. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a CNN with
two convolutional layers, and $500$ and $1500$ kernels, respectively, best
speedups achieve $3.28\times$ using four CPUs and $2.45\times$ with three GPUs.
Modern imaging datasets, larger and more complex than CIFAR-10 will certainly
require more than $60$-$90$\% of processing time calculating convolutions, and
speedups will tend to increase accordingly.

the original data while preserving a pre-defined set of statistical properties
in the microdata. For continuous variables, available methodologies rely
essentially on matrix masking and in particular on adding noise to the original
values, using more or less refined procedures depending on the extent of
information that one seeks to preserve. Almost all of these methods make use of
the critical assumption that the original datasets follow a normal distribution
and/or that the noise has such a distribution. This assumption is, however,
restrictive in the sense that few variables follow empirically a Gaussian
pattern: the distribution of household income, for example, is positively
skewed, and this skewness is essential information that has to be considered
and preserved. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a simple
multiplicative masking method that preserves skewness of the original data
while offering a sufficient level of disclosure risk control. Numerical
examples are provided, leading to the suggestion that this method could be
well-suited for the dissemination of a broad range of microdata, including

is a significant and challenging problem considering the safety of system and

OPMSF problem is formulated considering the mid-time scheduling and the faults
at bus and generator. Two- side adjustment methods including the load shedding
and the reconfiguration are coordinated for reducing the fault effects. To
address the formulated non-convex problem, the travel equality constraint and
fractional energy efficiency operation indicator (EEOI) limitation are
transformed into the convex forms. Then, considering the infeasibility scenario
affected by faults, a further relaxation is adopted to formulate a new problem
with feasibility guaranteed. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived to
ensure that the new problem has the same optimal solution as the original one.
Because of the mixed-integer nonlinear feature, an optimal algorithm based on
Benders decomposition (BD) is developed to solve the new one. Due to the slow
convergence caused by the time-coupled constraints, a low-complexity
near-optimal algorithm based on BD (LNBD) is proposed. The results verify the
effectivity of the proposed methods and algorithms.

during sills and laccoliths emplacement. However, most models of sill and
laccolith emplacement neglect inelastic processes by assuming purely elastic
deformation of the host rock. This assumption has never been tested, so that
the role of inelastic deformation on the growth dynamics of magma intrusions
remains poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce the first analytical
model of shallow sill and laccolith emplacement that accounts for
elasto-plastic deformation of the host rock. It considers the intrusion's
overburden as a thin elastic bending plate attached to an
elastic-perfectly-plastic foundation. We find that, for geologically realistic
values of the model parameters, the horizontal extent of the plastic zone lp is
much smaller than the radius of the intrusion a. By modeling the quasi-static
growth of a sill, we find that the ratio lp/a decreases during propagation, as
1/ $\sqrt$ a 4 $\Delta$P , with $\Delta$P the magma overpressure. The model
also shows that the extent of the plastic zone decreases with the intrusion's
depth, while it increases if the host rock is weaker. Comparison between our
elasto-plastic model and existing purely elastic models shows that plasticity
can have a significant effect on intrusion propagation dynamics, with e.g. up
to a doubling of the overpressure necessary for the sill to grow. Our results
suggest that plasticity effects might be small for large sills, but conversely
that they might be substantial for early sill propagation. 2

in many directions. Borrowing from several areas of other sciences, the current
diversity of concepts, models and tools available contributes to understanding
and fostering individual data dissemination in a privacy-preserving way, as
well as unleashing new sources of information for the benefits of society at
large. However, such diversity doesn't come without some difficulties.
Currently, the task of selecting the optimal analytical environment to conduct
anonymization is complicated by the multitude of available choices. Based on
recent contributions from the literature and inspired by cryptography, this
paper proposes the first cipher for data anonymization. The functioning of this
cipher shows that, in fact, every anonymization method can be viewed as a
general form of rank swapping with unconstrained permutation structures. Beyond
all the currently existing methods that it can mimic, this cipher offers a new
way to practice data anonymization, notably by performing anonymization in an
ex ante way, instead of being engaged in several ex post evaluations and
iterations to reach the protection and information properties sought after.
Moreover, the properties of this cipher point to some previously unknown
general insights into the task of data anonymization considered at a general
level of functioning. Finally, and to make the cipher operational, this paper
proposes the introduction of permutation menus in data anonymization, where
recently developed universal measures of disclosure risk and information loss
are used ex ante for the calibration of permutation keys. To justify the
relevance of their uses, a theoretical characterization of these measures is
also proposed.

experimental investigation with different irradiation fluences up to 7.30x10^16
cm^-2 and different proton implantation depths, in order to clarify whether and
to what extent the critical current is enhanced or suppressed, what are the
effects of irradiation on the critical temperature, the resistivity and the
critical magnetic fields, and finally what is the role played by the substrate
in this context. We find that the effect of irradiation on superconducting
properties is generally small as compared to the case of other iron-based
superconductors. Such effect is more evident on the critical current density
Jc, while it is minor on the transition temperature Tc, on the normal state
resistivity and on the upper critical field Hc2 up to the highest fluences
explored in this work. In addition, our analysis shows that when protons
implant in the substrate far from the superconducting film, the critical
current can be enhanced up to 50% of the pristine value at 7 T and 12 K, while
there is no appreciable effect on critical temperature and critical fields
together with a slight decrease in resistivity. On the contrary, when the
implantation layer is closer to the film-substrate interface, both critical
current and temperature show a decrease accompanied by an enhancement of the
resistivity and the lattice strain. This result evidences that possible
modifications induced by irradiation in the substrate may affect the
superconducting properties of the film via lattice strain. The robustness of
the Fe(Se,Te) system to irradiation induced damage makes it a promising
compound for the fabrication of magnets in high-energy accelerators.

gives rise to parity bifurcation points where the condensate, as a function of
excitation intensity, bifurcates into one of two anisotropic degenerate

possible using controlled nonresonant pulses, perturbing the solution from one

  https://github.com/mil-tokyo/MCD_DA",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we present a method for unsupervised domain adaptation. Many
adversarial learning methods train domain classifier networks to distinguish
the features as either a source or target and train a feature generator network
to mimic the discriminator. Two problems exist with these methods. First, the
domain classifier only tries to distinguish the features as a source or target
and thus does not consider task-specific decision boundaries between classes.
Therefore, a trained generator can generate ambiguous features near class
boundaries. Second, these methods aim to completely match the feature
distributions between different domains, which is difficult because of each
domain's characteristics.
  To solve these problems, we introduce a new approach that attempts to align
distributions of source and target by utilizing the task-specific decision
boundaries. We propose to maximize the discrepancy between two classifiers'
outputs to detect target samples that are far from the support of the source. A
feature generator learns to generate target features near the support to
minimize the discrepancy. Our method outperforms other methods on several
datasets of image classification and semantic segmentation. The codes are

  the Eighth SIAM Workshop on Combinatorial Scientific Computing, Bergen,
  Norway, June 2018",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are widely used for modeling of
dynamical systems. The difficulty in solving numerically a DAE is measured by
its differentiation index. For highly accurate simulation of dynamical systems,
it is important to convert high-index DAEs into low-index DAEs. Most of
existing simulation software packages for dynamical systems are equipped with
an index-reduction algorithm given by Mattsson and S\""{o}derlind.
Unfortunately, this algorithm fails if there are numerical cancellations.
  These numerical cancellations are often caused by accurate constants in
structural equations. Distinguishing those accurate constants from generic
parameters that represent physical quantities, Murota and Iri introduced the
notion of a mixed matrix as a mathematical tool for faithful model description
in structural approach to systems analysis. For DAEs described with the use of
mixed matrices, efficient algorithms to compute the index have been developed
by exploiting matroid theory.
  This paper presents an index-reduction algorithm for linear DAEs whose
coefficient matrices are mixed matrices, i.e., linear DAEs containing physical
quantities as parameters. Our algorithm detects numerical cancellations between
accurate constants, and transforms a DAE into an equivalent DAE to which
Mattsson--S\""{o}derlind's index-reduction algorithm is applicable. Our
algorithm is based on the combinatorial relaxation approach, which is a
framework to solve a linear algebraic problem by iteratively relaxing it into
an efficiently solvable combinatorial optimization problem. The algorithm does
not rely on symbolic manipulations but on fast combinatorial algorithms on
graphs and matroids. Furthermore, we provide an improved algorithm under an
assumption based on dimensional analysis of dynamical systems.

the two-photon resonance. Apart from the time-dependent concurrence, which can
be assigned to the two-photon density matrix at any point in time, we study
single- and double-time integrated concurrences commonly used in the literature
that are based on different quantum state reconstruction schemes. We argue that
the single-time integrated concurrence can be thought of as the concurrence of
photons simultaneously emitted from the cavity without resolving the common
emission time, while the more widely studied double-time integrated concurrence
refers to photons that are neither filtered with respect to the emission time
of the first photon nor with respect to the delay time between the two emitted
photons. Analytic and numerical calculations reveal that the single-time
integrated concurrence indeed agrees well with the typical value of the
time-dependent concurrence at long times, even in the presence of phonons.
Thus, the more easily measurable single-time integrated concurrence gives
access to the physical information represented by the time-dependent
concurrence. However, the double-time integrated concurrence shows a different
behavior with respect to changes in the exciton fine structure splitting and
even displays a completely different trend when the ratio between the cavity
loss rate and the fine structure splitting is varied while keeping their
product constant. This implies the non-equivalence of the physical information

for the theory of stochastic processes. It has been known for a long time that,
in its original form, this theorem does not hold in quantum mechanics. More
generally, it does not hold in any theory of stochastic processes -- classical,
quantum or beyond -- that does not just describe passive observations, but
allows for active interventions. Such processes form the basis of the study of
causal modelling across the sciences, including in the quantum domain. To date,
these frameworks have lacked a conceptual underpinning similar to that provided
by Kolmogorov's theorem for classical stochastic processes. We prove a
generalized extension theorem that applies to all theories of stochastic
processes, putting them on equally firm mathematical ground as their classical
counterpart. Additionally, we show that quantum causal modelling and quantum
stochastic processes are equivalent. This provides the correct framework for
the description of experiments involving continuous control, which play a
crucial role in the development of quantum technologies. Furthermore, we show
that the original extension theorem follows from the generalized one in the
correct limit, and elucidate how a comprehensive understanding of general
stochastic processes allows one to unambiguously define the distinction between
those that are classical and those that are quantum.

$1/2-$spin fermions in co-dimension one Randall-Sundrum braneworld scenarios.
We consider delta-like, domain walls and deformed domain walls membranes.
Beyond the influence of the spacetime dimension $D$ we also consider three
types of couplings: (i) the standard Yukawa coupling with the scalar field and
parameter $\eta_1$, (ii) a Yukawa-dilaton coupling with two parameters $\eta_2$
and $\lambda$ and (iii) a dilaton derivative coupling with parameter $h$.
Together with the deformation parameter $s$, we end up with five free parameter
to be considered. For the zero mode we find that the localization is dependent
of $D$, because the spinorial representation changes when the bulk
dimensionality is odd or even and must be treated separately. For case (i) we
find that in odd dimensions only one chirality can be localized and for even
dimension a massless Dirac spinor is trapped over the brane. In the cases (ii)
and (iii) we find that for some values of the parameters, both chiralities can
be localized in odd dimensions and for even dimensions we obtain that the
massless Dirac spinor is trapped over the brane. We also calculated numerically
resonances for cases (ii) and (iii) by using the transfer matrix method. We
find that, for deformed defects, the increasing of $D$ induces a shift in the
peaks of resonances. For a given $\lambda$ with domain walls, we find that the
resonances can show up by changing the spacetime dimensionality. For example,
the same case in $D=5$ do not induces resonances but when we consider $D=10$
one peak of resonance is found. Therefore the introduction of more dimensions,
diversely from the bosonic case, can change drastically the zero mode and
resonances in fermion fields.

spheres hardly change the drag of the system beyond the trivial viscosity
effects caused by replacing the working fluid with particles. The size of the
particle has a marginal effect on the drag, with smaller diameter particles
showing only slightly lower drag. Increasing the particle volume fraction shows
a net drag increase as the effective viscosity of the fluid is also increased.
The increase in drag for increasing particle volume fraction is corroborated by
performing laser Doppler anemometry where we find that the turbulent velocity
fluctuations also increase with increasing volume fraction. In contrast with
rigid spheres, for bubbles the effective drag reduction also increases with
increasing Reynolds number. Bubbles are also much more effective in reducing
the overall drag.

Our calculations of the Rabi oscillations between the doubly dressed spin
states show that the maximum suppression of decoherence is achieved at the

the Rabi frequency of spins in the microwave field. This effect is feasible
even in the absence of phase matching in the radiofrequency field and for
different types of inhomogeneity of the microwave field. The manifestations of
such suppression in the published EPR experiments with the bichromatic driving

their potential applications in topological qubits and low-power electronics,
which are closely related to their thermal transport properties. In this work,
by solving the Boltzmann transport equation based on first-principles
calculations, we systematically investigate the phonon transport properties of
topological semimetal WC and WN. The predicted room-temperature lattice thermal
conductivities of WC (WN) along a and c directions are 1140.64 (7.47)
$\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ and 1214.69 (5.39) $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$.
Considering the similar crystal structure of WC and WN, it is quite interesting
to find that the thermal conductivity of WC is more than two orders of
magnitude higher than that of WN. It is found that, different from WN, the
large acoustic-optical (a-o) gap prohibits the
acoustic+acoustic$\rightarrow$optical (aao) scattering, which gives rise to
very long phonon lifetimes, leading to ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity
in WC. For WN, the lack of a-o gap is due to soft phonon modes in optical
branches, which can provide more scattering channels for aao scattering,
producing very short phonon lifetimes. Further deep insight can be attained
from their different electronic structures. Distinctly different from that in
WC, the density of states (DOS) of WN at the Fermi level becomes very sharp,
which leads to destabilization of WN, producing soft phonon modes. It is found
that the small shear modulus $G$ and $C_{44}$ limit the stability of WN,
compared with WC. Our works provide valuable information for phonon transports
in WC and WN, and motivate further experimental works to study their lattice
thermal conductivities.

due to charge transfer, at the interface between a ferromagnetic metal (FM) and
the molecules of an organic semiconductor. Yet, if the latter is also magnetic
(e.g. molecular spin chains), the interfacial magnetic coupling can generate
complexity within magnetotransport experiments. Also, assembling this interface
may degrade the properties of its constituents (e.g. spin crossover or
non-sublimable molecules). To circumvent these issues, one can separate the
molecular and FM films using a less reactive nonmagnetic metal (NM).
Spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on the prototypical
system Co(001)//Cu/Mnphthalocyanine (MnPc) reveal that the Cu/MnPc spinterface
atop ferromagnetic Co is highly spin-polarized at room temperature, up to Cu
spacer thicknesses of at least 10 monolayers. Ab-initio theory describes a spin
polarization of the topmost Cu layer after molecular hybridization that can be
accompanied by magnetic hardening effects. This spinterface's unexpected
robustness paves the way for 1) integrating electronically fragile molecules
within organic spinterfaces, and 2) manipulating molecular spin chains using
the well-documented spin transfer torque properties of the FM/NM bilayer.

proposed to solving the inverse elastic surface scattering problem which arises
from the near-field imaging of periodic structures. We demonstrate how an
enhanced resolution can be achieved by using more easily measurable far-field
data. The surface is assumed to be a small and smooth perturbation of an
elastically rigid plane. By placing a rectangular slab of a homogeneous and
isotropic elastic medium with larger mass density above the surface, more
propagating wave modes can be utilized from the far-field data which
contributes to the reconstruction resolution. Requiring only a single
illumination, the method begins with the far-to-near (FtN) field data
conversion and utilizes the transformed field expansion to derive an analytic
solution for the direct problem, which leads to an explicit inversion formula
for the inverse problem. Moreover, a nonlinear correction scheme is developed
to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction. Results show that the proposed
method is capable of stably reconstructing surfaces with resolution controlled
by the slab's density.

shift and dying neurons using the concept of linked neurons. We define the
neuron linkage in terms of two constraints: first, all neuron activations in
the linkage must have the same operating point. That is to say, all of them
share input weights. Secondly, a set of neurons is linked if and only if there
is at least one member of the linkage that has a non-zero gradient in regard to
the input of the activation function. This means that for any input in the
activation function, there is at least one member of the linkage that operates
in a non-flat and non-zero area. This simple change has profound implications
in the network learning dynamics. In this article we explore the consequences
of this proposal and show that by using this kind of units, internal covariate
shift is implicitly solved. As a result of this, the use of linked neurons
allows to train arbitrarily large networks without any architectural or
algorithmic trick, effectively removing the need of using re-normalization
schemes such as Batch Normalization, which leads to halving the required
training time. It also solves the problem of the need for standarized input
data. Results show that the units using the linkage not only do effectively
solve the aforementioned problems, but are also a competitive alternative with
respect to state-of-the-art with very promising results.

of computing hosts that is theoretically secure against cryptanalysis, even by
a quantum computer. Although there is much active research into improving the
QKD technology itself, there is still significant work to be done to apply
engineering methodology and determine how it can be practically built to scale
within an enterprise IT environment. Significant challenges exist in building a
practical key management service for use in a metropolitan network. QKD is
generally a point-to-point technique only and is subject to steep performance
constraints. The integration of QKD into enterprise-level computing has been
researched, to enable quantum-safe communication. A novel method for
constructing a key management service is presented that allows arbitrary
computing hosts on one site to establish multiple secure communication sessions
with the hosts of another site. A key exchange protocol is proposed where
symmetric private keys are granted to hosts while satisfying the scalability
needs of an enterprise population of users. The key management service operates
within a layered architectural style that is able to interoperate with various
underlying QKD implementations. Variable levels of security for the host
population are enforced through a policy engine. A network layer provides key
generation across a network of nodes connected by quantum links. Scheduling and
routing functionality allows quantum key material to be relayed across trusted
nodes. Optimizations are performed to match the real-time host demand for key
material with the capacity afforded by the infrastructure. The result is a
flexible and scalable architecture that is suitable for enterprise use and
independent of any specific QKD technology.

We simulate random walk in the plane numerically as a discrete time process
with fixed step length. We measure first-passage probability to touch the
absorbing sphere of radius $R$ in 2D. We found a regular deviation of the
first-passage probability from the exact function, which we attribute to the
finiteness of the random walk step.

to the complex interplay between the different image factors, such as the
foreground, background and pose information. In this work, we aim at generating
such images based on a novel, two-stage reconstruction pipeline that learns a
disentangled representation of the aforementioned image factors and generates
novel person images at the same time. First, a multi-branched reconstruction
network is proposed to disentangle and encode the three factors into embedding
features, which are then combined to re-compose the input image itself. Second,
three corresponding mapping functions are learned in an adversarial manner in
order to map Gaussian noise to the learned embedding feature space, for each
factor respectively. Using the proposed framework, we can manipulate the
foreground, background and pose of the input image, and also sample new
embedding features to generate such targeted manipulations, that provide more
control over the generation process. Experiments on Market-1501 and Deepfashion
datasets show that our model does not only generate realistic person images
with new foregrounds, backgrounds and poses, but also manipulates the generated
factors and interpolates the in-between states. Another set of experiments on
Market-1501 shows that our model can also be beneficial for the person
re-identification task.

that is slightly different from the terrestrial standard. Here, by determining
the Cr isotopic composition of 17 lunar, 9 terrestrial and 5 enstatite
chondrite samples, we re-assess the isotopic similarity between these different
planetary bodies, and provide the first robust estimate for the Moon. In
average, terrestrial and enstatite samples show similar eps_54Cr. On the other
hand, lunar samples show variables excesses of 53Cr and 54Cr compared to
terrestrial and enstatite chondrites samples with correlated eps_53Cr and
eps_54Cr (per 10,000 deviation of the 53Cr/52Cr and 54Cr/52Cr ratios normalized
to the 50Cr/52Cr ratio from Cr standard). Unlike previous suggestions, we show
for the first time that cosmic irradiation can affect significantly the Cr
isotopic composition of lunar materials. Moreover, we also suggest that rather
than spallation reactions, neutron capture effects are the dominant process
controlling the Cr isotope composition of lunar igneous rocks. This is
supported by the correlation between eps_53Cr and eps_54Cr, and 150Sm/152Sm
ratios. After correction of these effects, the average eps_54Cr of the Moon is
indistinguishable from the terrestrial and enstatite chondrite materials
reinforcing the idea of an Earth-Moon-Enstatite chondrite system homogeneity.
This is compatible with the most recent scenarios of Moon formation suggesting
an efficient physical homogenization after a high-energy impact on a fast
spinning Earth, and/or with an impactor originating from the same reservoir in
the inner proto-planetary disk as the Earth and enstatite chondrites and having

character of the disorder in both systems is different they show interesting
similar properties. In particular, many-body localization appears for a
sufficiently large disorder as verified by a time evolution of initial density
wave states as well as using statistical properties of energy levels for small
system sizes. Starting with different initial states, we observe that the
localization properties are energy-dependent which reveals an inverted
many-body localization edge in both systems (that finding is also verified by
statistical analysis of energy spectrum). Moreover, we consider computationally
challenging regime of transition between many body localized and extended
phases where we observe a characteristic algebraic decay of density
correlations which may be attributed to subdiffusion (and Griffiths-like
regions) in the studied systems. Ergodicity breaking in the disordered
Bose-Hubbard models is compared with the slowing-down of the time evolution of
the clean system at large interactions.

separative power of the Iguassu gas centrifuge (GC) on the velocity of the
rotor.
  Design/methodology/approach - The dependence is determined by means of
computer simulation of the gas flow in the GC and numerical solution of the
diffusion equation for the light component of the binary mixture of uranium
isotopes. 2D axisymmetric model with the sources/sinks of the mass, angular
momentum and energy reproducing the scoops was explored for the computer
simulation. Parameters of the model correspond to the parameters of the
so-called Iguassu centrifuge. The separative power has been optimised in
relation to the pressure of the gas, temperature of the gas, the temperature
drop along the rotor, power of the source of angularmomentum and energy, feed
flow and geometry of the lower baffle.
  Findings - In the result, the optimised separative power depends only on the
velocity, length and diameter of the rotor. The dependence on the velocity is
described by the power law function with the power law index 2.6 which
demonstrate stronger dependence on the velocity than it follows from
experimental data. However, the separative power obtained with limitation on
the pressure growth with the velocity depends on the velocity on the power
similar to 2 which well agree with the experiments.
  Originality/value - For the first time, the optimised separative power of the
GCs have been calculated via numerical simulation of the gas flow and diffusion
of the binary mixture of isotope.

particles interacting by steric and screened Coulomb interactions,
respectively. In the supercooled regime, the structural relaxation time
$\tau_\alpha$ of both systems grows steeply with volume fraction, reminiscent
of the behavior of colloidal hard spheres. Computer simulations confirm that
the growth of $\tau_\alpha$ on approaching the glass transition is independent
of particle softness. By contrast, softness becomes relevant at very large
packing fractions when the system falls out of equilibrium. In this
non-equilibrium regime, $\tau_\alpha$ depends surprisingly weakly on packing
fraction and time correlation functions exhibit a compressed exponential decay
consistent with stress-driven relaxation. The transition to this novel regime
coincides with the onset of an anomalous decrease of local order with
increasing density typical of ultrasoft systems. We propose that these peculiar
dynamics results from the combination of the non-equilibrium aging dynamics
expected in the glassy state and the tendency of colloids interacting through
soft potentials to refluidize at high packing fractions.

Our first glances through this new window upon the sky has revealed a new
population of objects. Since it first began observing in late 2015, the
advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has
detected gravitational waves three times, along with an additional strong
candidate -- and there shall be orders of magnitude more in the years to come.
In all four cases, the waveform's signature is consistent with general
relativity's predictions for the merging of two black holes. Through parameter
estimation studies, estimates on features such as the black holes' masses and
spins have been determined. At least two of the black hole pairs lie above the
mass range spanned by comparable black holes observed through traditional
means. This suggests they constitute a separate population, either too elusive
or rare to be found with traditional telescopes.
  The most natural questions to ask about these black holes -- how did they
form, how many of them are there, and how can they be categorized -- remain
open ended. We know black holes can form when massive stars die, so it's most
natural to claim stars as their progenitors. Since we now know black holes
merge into larger black holes, could it be the case that they formed from
previous mergers? Were the two black holes part of a binary from their birth,
or did they become coupled later on in life? The measurements provided by LIGO
can help answer these questions and more.
  Throughout this thesis, I will describe and demonstrate results from a number
of novel methods whose purpose is to better understand these black holes and
their progenitors. At their heart, these methods give answers to a few,
critical questions.

the semi-direct product of the super-Virasoro and the super-Kac-Moody algebras.
These emergent symmetries are spontaneously and explicitly broken, which leads
to a low energy effective action: super-Schwarzian action plus an action of a

contributions to the chaotic behavior of four point functions in various
$SO(q)$ channels. In singlet channel, we show that the out-of-time-ordered

out-of-time-ordered correlator related to a $SO(q)$ generator grows linearly in

Derivation of the full RMT spectral form factor $K(t)$ from semiclassics has
been completed only much later in a tour de force by Mueller et al (2004). In
recent years, the questions of long-time dynamics at high energies, for which
the full many-body energy spectrum becomes relevant, are coming at the
forefront even for simple many-body quantum systems, such as locally
interacting spin chains. Such systems display two universal types of behaviour
which are termed as `many-body localized phase' and `ergodic phase'. In the
ergodic phase, the spectral fluctuations are excellently described by RMT, even
for very simple interactions and in the absence of any external source of
disorder. Here we provide the first theoretical explanation for these
observations. We compute $K(t)$ explicitly in the leading two orders in $t$ and
show its agreement with RMT for non-integrable, time-reversal invariant

equivalent to the property of being remarkable, and we sought to argue that
this axiom should be seen as intrinsically justified. This built on related
earlier work in which the notion of an $\alpha$-reflective cardinal was
formulated. Then Welch and Roberts put forward a family of reflection
principles, Welch's principle implying the existence of a proper class of
Shelah cardinals and provably consistent relative to a superstrong cardinal,
and Roberts' principle implying the existence of a proper class of 1-extendible

tentatively argued that his principle should be seen as intrinsically justified
(at least on the assumption that a weaker form of reflection involving
reflection of second-order formulas with a second-order parameter should be
seen as intrinsically justified). This work overlapped with previous work of
Victoria Marshall's on reflection principles. We analyze the relationship
between reflection principles equivalent to those studied in my earlier work
and stronger but similar reflection principles which are natural extensions of
those of Welch and Roberts. We also show how a natural strengthening of
Roberts' reflection principle yields the existence of supercompact cardinals,
and in the process solve a question which Marshall left open, of whether her
theory $B_0(V_0)$ is strong enough to imply the existence of supercompact
cardinals. We also manage to resolve negatively her question of whether her

this reflection phenomenon in the molecular complex Sgr C and by determining
the line-of-sight positions of its main bright substructures. Using
observations made with XMM-Newton and Chandra between 2000 and 2014, we
investigated the variability of the reflected emission. We carried out an
imaging and a spectral analysis. We also used a Monte Carlo model of the
reflected spectra to constrain the line-of-sight positions of the brightest
clumps, and hence to assign an approximate date to the associated illuminating
events. We show that the emission from Sgr C exhibits significant variability
in both space and time, which confirms its reflection origin. The most likely
illuminating source is Sgr A*. We report two distinct variability timescales,
as one clump undergoes a sudden rise and fall in about 2005, while two others
vary smoothly throughout the whole 2000-2014 period. By fitting the Monte Carlo
model to the data, we are able to place tight constraints on the 3D positions
of the clumps. These two independent approaches provide a consistent picture of
the past activity of Sgr A*, since the two slowly varying clumps are located on
the same wavefront, while the rapidly varying clump corresponds to a different
wavefront, that is, to a different illuminating event. We show that Sgr A*
experienced at least two powerful outbursts in the past 300 years, and for the

quantum technologies, such as optical quantum memories. In crystals doped with
Kramers rare-earth ions, such as erbium and neodymium, efficient optical
pumping is challenging due to the relatively short population lifetimes of the
electronic Zeeman levels, of the order of 100 ms at around 4 K. In this article
we show that optical pumping of the hyperfine levels in isotopically enriched
$^{145}$Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals is more efficient, owing to the longer
population relaxation times of hyperfine levels. By optically cycling the
population many times through the excited state a nuclear-spin flip can be
forced in the ground-state hyperfine manifold, in which case the population is
trapped for several seconds before relaxing back to the pumped hyperfine level.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in applications we perform an
atomic frequency comb memory experiment with 33% storage efficiency in
$^{145}$Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$, which is on a par with results obtained in
non-Kramers ions, e.g. europium and praseodymium, where optical pumping is
generally efficient due to the quenched electronic spin. Efficient optical
pumping in neodymium-doped crystals is also of interest for spectral filtering
in biomedical imaging, as neodymium has an absorption wavelength compatible
with tissue imaging. In addition to these applications, our study is of
interest for understanding spin dynamics in Kramers ions with nuclear spin.

the phase-locking regime the frequency of the incoming ac signal coincides with
the frequency of autooscillations which for typical antiferromagnets fall into

precession-induced tilting of the magnetic sublattices related to the so-called

approximation for the Allen-Cahn equation, which is a second order nonlinear
equation arising from the phase separation model. We firstly present a fully
discrete interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) finite element method,
which is based on the modified Crank-Nicolson scheme and a mid-point
approximation of the nonliner term $f(u)$. We then derive the stability
analysis and error estimates for the proposed IPDG method under some regularity
assumptions on the initial function $u_0$. There are two key works in our
analysis, one is to establish unconditionally energy-stable scheme for the
discrete solutions. The other is to use a discrete spectrum estimate to handle
the midpoint of the discrete solutions $u^m$ and $u^{m+1}$ in the nonlinear
term, instead of using the standard Gronwall inequality technique. This
discrete spectrum estimate is not trivial to obtain since the IPDG space and
the conforming $H^1$ space are not contained in each other. We obtain that all
our error bounds depend on reciprocal of the perturbation parameter $\epsilon$
only in some lower polynomial order, instead of exponential order. These
sharper error bounds are the key elements in proving the convergence of our
numerical solution to the mean curvature flow. Finally, numerical experiments
are also provided to show the performance of the presented approach and method.

related to a large family of Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows. The
ultimate aim is to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\""older
observables with respect to a very general class of Gibbs measures. The
approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat \cite{D1} and further developed in
\cite{St2} is substantially refined here, allowing to deal with much more
general situations than before, although we still restrict ourselves to the
uniformly hyperbolic case. A rather general procedure is established which
produces the desired estimates whenever the Gibbs measure admits a Pesin set
with exponentially small tails, that is a Pesin set whose preimages along the
flow have measures decaying exponentially fast. We call such Gibbs measures
regular. Recent results in \cite{GSt} prove existence of such Pesin sets for
hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and flows for a large variety of Gibbs measures
determined by H\""older continuous potentials. The strong spectral estimates for
Ruelle operators and well-established techniques lead to exponential decay of
correlations for H\""older continuous observables, as well as to some other
consequences such as: (a) existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the
Ruelle zeta function with a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing

derived as the nonrelativistic limit (or approximation at sub-Hubble scales) of
a general relativistic model in [3, 4]. The latter is defined by an
energy-momentum tensor containing only dust and a nontrivial energy flow. The
nonrelativistic limit contains in leading order a 1st-order relativistic
contribution to the spatial curvature whose time-dependence drives the
accelerated expansion of the Universe (we do not need any kind of dark energy).
Analytic solutions of the model are fixed by three constants (initial
conditions). In the present paper we use our model as a toy model by adjusting
the three constants in two different ways to a second order polynomial fit by
Montenari and R\""as\""anen [5] to the observed expansion rate $H(z)$ for $z
\lesssim 2$ (mainly cosmic chronometer data). In scenario 1 we adjust our model
to this fit and its derivative at the self-consistently determined transition
redshift $z_t$. In scenario 2 we use the same fit at $z_t$ and in addition
$H(z)$ at decoupling $(z = 1089)$. The Hubble parameter $H_0$ is taken from the
polynomial fit in [5]: $H_0 = 64.2 km/s/Mpc$. For both scenarios we obtain a
satisfactory agreement between predicted and observed $H(z)$ values. But the
outcomes for the curvature function $k(z)$ are completely different: In
scenario 1 we obtain a strong variation of $k(z)$ ranging from $k(0) = - 1.216$
up to $k(2.33) = 0.718$. On the other hand scenario 2 shows an almost constant
value for $k(z) \sim - 1$ for all $z \lesssim 2$ in agreement with the
polynomial fit to one of the FRW consistency conditions performed in [5].

Gaussian curvature, without a stretch elastic cost. We deal with systems
slender enough to have a small bend energy cost. Shape change is induced by
light or heat causing contraction along a non-uniform director field in the
plane of an initially flat nematic sheet. The forward problem is, given a
director distribution, what shape is induced? Along the way, we determine the
Gaussian curvature and the evolution with induced mechanical deformation of the
director field and of material curves in the surface (proto-radii) that will
become radii in the final surface. The inverse problem is, given a target
shape, what director field does one need to specify? Analytic examples of
director fields are fully calculated that will, for specific deformations,
yield catenoids and paraboloids of revolution. The general prescription is
given in terms of an integral equation.

porous media and electrode materials, involve the application of image
processing methods to data acquired by microscopy techniques. In this study, we
present a theoretical analysis of the effects of the image size reduction, due
to a gradual decimation of the original image. Three different decimation
procedures were implemented and their consequences on the discrete correlation
functions and the coarseness are reported and analyzed. A normalization for
each of the correlation functions has been performed. When the loss of
statistical information has not been significant for a decimated image, its
normalized correlation function is forecast by the trend of the original image.
In contrast, when the decimated image does not represent the statistical
evidence of the original one, the normalized correlation function diverts from
the reference function. Moreover, the equally weighted sum of the average of
the squared differences leads to a definition of an overall error. During the
first stages of the gradual decimation, the error remains relatively small and
independent of the decimation procedure. Above a threshold defined by the
correlation length of the reference function, the error becomes a function of
the number of decimation steps. At this stage, some statistical information is
lost and the error becomes dependent of the decimation procedure. These results
may help us to restrict the amount of information that one can afford to lose
during a decimation process, in order to reduce the computational and memory
cost, when one aims to diminish the time consumed by a characterization or
reconstruction technique, yet maintaining the statistical quality of the
digitized sample.

  Morphology-Aware Generative Model","submitted to Computational Material Science",,,,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Direct prediction of material properties from microstructures through
statistical models has shown to be a potential approach to accelerating
computational material design with large design spaces. However, statistical
modeling of highly nonlinear mappings defined on high-dimensional
microstructure spaces is known to be data-demanding. Thus, the added value of
such predictive models diminishes in common cases where material samples (in
forms of 2D or 3D microstructures) become costly to acquire either
experimentally or computationally. To this end, we propose a generative machine
learning model that creates an arbitrary amount of artificial material samples
with negligible computation cost, when trained on only a limited amount of
authentic samples. The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a
morphology constraint to the training of the generative model, that enforces
the resultant artificial material samples to have the same morphology
distribution as the authentic ones. We show empirically that the proposed model
creates artificial samples that better match with the authentic ones in
material property distributions than those generated from a state-of-the-art
Markov Random Field model, and thus is more effective at improving the
prediction performance of a predictive structure-property model.

to enhance early CV deployments with the objective of depicting the lessons
learned from the CUCVT testbed, which includes unique features to support
multiple CV applications running simultaneously. The lessons learned in the
CUCVT testbed are described at three different levels: i) the development of
system architecture and prototyping in a controlled environment, ii) the
deployment of the CUCVT testbed, and iii) the validation of the CV application
experiments in the CUCVT. Our field experiments with a CV application validated

related to heterogeneous wireless networks, real time data aggregation, a

relegating data rate. In the scheme we introduce here, we implement a joint

energy efficiencies. After introducing and analysing the structure with respect
to latter metrics, we derive closed-form expressions of the bit error rate
(BER) performance over Rayleigh fading channels and we validate the outcome by
simulation results. Simulation are used verify the analyses and show that, in
terms of BER, the proposed CFIM outperforms the existing index modulation (IM)
based systems such as spatial modulation (SM), OFDM-IM and OFDM schemes
significantly. To better exhibit the particularities of the proposed scheme,
PAPR, complexity, spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) are
thoroughly examined. Results indicate a high SE while ensuring an elevated
reliability compared to the aforementioned systems. In addition, the concept is
extended to synchronous multiuser communication networks, where full
functionality is obtained. With the characteristics demonstrated in this work,
the proposed system would constitute an exceptional nominee for Internet of

condensate and the mass to the order $q-1$ with the normalized $q$-expectation
value under the massless free particle approximation. The following facts were
found. The condensate $\Phi$ divided by $v$, $\Phi/v$, at $q$ is smaller than
that at $q'$ for $q>q'$ as a function of $T_{\mathrm{ph}}/v$ which is the
physical temperature $T_{\mathrm{ph}}$ divided by $v$, where $T_{\mathrm{ph}}$
at $q=1$ coincides with $T$ and $v$ is the value of the condensate at $T=0$.
The mass decreases, reaches minimum, and increases after that, as
$T_{\mathrm{ph}}$ increases. The mass at $q>1$ is lighter than the mass at
$q=1$ at low physical temperature and heavier than the mass at $q=1$ at high
physical temperature. The effects of the nonentensivity on the physical
quantity as a function of $T_{\mathrm{ph}}$ become strong as $|q-1|$ increases.
The results indicate the significance of the definition of the expectation

density operator, when the terms including the volume of the system are not
negligible.
