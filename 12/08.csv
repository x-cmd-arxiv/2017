the passage geometry, which affects the flow rate--pressure drop relation. For
a given pressure drop, in channels with narrow rectangular cross-section, the
flow rate varies as the cube of the channel height, so deformation can produce
significant quantitative effects, including nonlinear dependence on the
pressure drop [{Gervais, T., El-Ali, J., G\""unther, A. \& Jensen, K.\ F.}\ 2006

\textbf{6}, 500--507]. Gervais et. al. proposed a successful model of the
deformation-induced change in the flow rate by heuristically coupling a Hookean
elastic response with the lubrication approximation for Stokes flow. However,
their model contains a fitting parameter that must be found for each channel
shape by performing an experiment. We present a perturbation approach for the
flow rate--pressure drop relation in a shallow deformable microchannel using
the theory of isotropic quasi-static plate bending and the Stokes equations
under a lubrication approximation (specifically, the ratio of the channel's
height to its width and of the channel's height to its length are both assumed
small). Our result contains no free parameters and confirms Gervais et. al.'s
observation that the flow rate is a quartic polynomial of the pressure drop.
The derived flow rate--pressure drop relation compares favorably with
experimental measurements.

$(0,k)$-runlength limited (RLL) constraint, i.e., no more than $k$ consecutive
`$0$'s are allowed. The feedback capacity of this channel is derived for all
$k\geq 1$, and is given by $$C^\mathrm{fb}_{(0,k)}(\varepsilon) =
\max\frac{\overline{\varepsilon}H_2(\delta_0)+\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\left(\overline{\varepsilon}^{i+1}H_2(\delta_i)\prod_{m=0}^{i-1}\delta_m\right)}{1+\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\left(\overline{\varepsilon}^{i+1}

probability, $\overline{\varepsilon}=1-\varepsilon$ and $H_2(\cdot)$ is the
binary entropy function. The maximization is only over $\delta_{k-1}$, while
the parameters $\delta_i$ for $i\leq k-2$ are straightforward functions of
$\delta_{k-1}$. The lower bound is obtained by constructing a simple coding for
all $k\geq1$. It is shown that the feedback capacity can be achieved using
zero-error, variable length coding. For the converse, an upper bound on the
non-causal setting, where the erasure is available to the encoder just prior to
the transmission, is derived. This upper bound coincides with the lower bound
and concludes the search for both the feedback capacity and the non-causal
capacity. As a result, non-causal knowledge of the erasures at the encoder does
not increase the feedback capacity for the $(0,k)$-RLL input-constrained BEC.
This property does not hold in general: the $(2,\infty)$-RLL input-constrained
BEC, where every `$1$' is followed by at least two `$0$'s, is used to show that
the feedback capacity can be strictly greater than the non-causal capacity.

particles of sizes larger than one micron, where the particle-particle
interactions are significantly more important than the particle-fluid
interactions. These flows can be successfully modeled by the existing Kinetic
Theory (KT) models when they are in the dilute regime with low
particle-particle collision frequencies, yielding results that agree well with
the simulation results of the event-driven hard sphere model or the more
sophisticated soft-sphere Discrete Element Method (DEM). However, these KT
models become less accurate for granular flows with soft particles (low
particle stiffness) at high particle-particle collision frequencies when the
predicted collision interval (the time of free flight for a particle prior to
the next collision) is comparable to the collision duration; there is a large
discrepancy between the results of these KT models and those from the DEM
models. In this work we develop a new KT model that could be used to model
granular systems of high collision frequencies with a finite particle
stiffness. This is done by modifying the fluctuation energy dissipation rate to
incorporate the ratio of collision duration to collision interval, a parameter
that is determined by both the collision frequency and particle stiffness. We
use a linear-spring-dashpot collision scheme to model the elastic potential
energy in the system and to uncover the relationship between the constitutive
relations of KT and the ratio of collision duration to collision interval.

unique, and was positive definite. The other showed that the ground state of
the repulsive model on a bipartite lattice at half-filling has a total spin
given by $|(N_A-N_B)/2|$, corresponding to the difference of the number of
lattice sites on the two sublattices divided by two. In the mid to late 1990's,
Shen extended these proofs to show that the pseudospin of the attractive model
was minimal until the electron number equaled $2N_A$ where it became fixed at
$J=|(N_A-N_B)/2|$ until the filling became $2N_B$, where it became minimal
again. In addition, Shen showed that a spin tower exists for the spin
eigenstates for the half-filled case on a bipartite lattice. The spin tower
says the minimal energy state with spin $S$ is higher in energy than the
minimal energy state with spin $S-1$ until we reach the ground-state spin given
above. One long standing conjecture about this model remains, namely does the
attractive model have such a spin tower for all fillings, which would then
imply that the repulsive model has minimal pseudopsin in its ground state.
While we do not prove this last conjecture, we provide a quick review of this
previous work, provide a constructive proof of the pseudospin of the attractive
model ground state, and describe the challenges with proving the remaining open
conjecture.

inextensible filaments and slender- rods are ubiquitous in nature, from the
dynamics of semi-flexible polymers and cytoskeletal filaments to cellular
mechanics and flagella. The coupling between the geometry of deformation and
the phys- ical interaction governing the dynamics of bio-filaments is complex.
Governing equations negotiate elastohydrodynamical interactions with
non-holonomic constraints arising from the filament inex- tensibility. Such
elastohydrodynamic systems are structurally convoluted, prone to numerical
erros, thus requiring penalization methods and high-order spatiotemporal
propagators. The asymptotic coarse-graining formulation presented here exploits
the momentum balance in the asymptotic limit of small rod-like elements which
are integrated semi-analytically. This greatly simplifies the elas-
tohydrodynamic interactions and overcomes previous numerical instability. The
resulting matricial system is straightforward and intuitive to implement, and
allows for a fast and efficient computation, over than a hundred times faster
than previous schemes. Only basic knowledge of systems of linear equations is
required, and implementation achieved with any solver of choice.
Generalisations for complex interaction of multiple rods, Brownian polymer
dynamics, active filaments and non-local hydrodynamics are also
straightforward. We demonstrate these in four examples commonly found in
biological systems, including the dynamics of filaments and flagella. Three of
these systems are novel in the literature. We additionally provide a Matlab
code that can be used as a basis for further generalisations.

(FRBs) require their radiation mechanisms to be coherent. Coherent curvature
radiation by bunches has been long discussed as the mechanism for radio pulsars
and recently for FRBs. Assuming that bunches are already generated in pulsar
magnetospheres, we calculate the spectrum of coherent curvature radiation under
a three-dimensional magnetic field geometry. Different from previous works
assuming parallel trajectories and a mono-energetic energy distribution of
electrons, we consider a bunch characterized by its length, curvature radius of
the trajectory family, bunch opening angle, and electron energy distribution.
We find that the curvature radiation spectra of the bunches are characterized
by a multi-segment broken power law, with the break frequencies depending on
bunch properties and trajectory configuration. We also emphasize that in a
pulsar magnetosphere only the fluctuation of net charges with respect to the
background (Goldreich-Julian) outflow can make a contribution to coherent
radiation. We apply this model to constrain the observed spectra of pulsars and
FRBs. For a typical pulsar ($B_p=10^{12}~{\rm G}$, $P=0.1~{\rm s}$), a small
fluctuation of the net charge $\delta n_{\rm GJ}\sim 0.1 n_{\rm GJ}$ can
provide the observable flux. For FRBs, the fluctuating net charge may be larger
due to its abrupt nature. For $\delta n_{\rm GJ}\sim n_{\rm GJ}$, a neutron
star with a strong magnetic field and fast rotation is required to power an FRB
in the spindown-powered model. The requirement is less stringent in the cosmic
comb model thanks to the larger cross section and compressed charge density of
the bunch made by the external astrophysical stream that combs the
magnetosphere.

depend on Fermi energy. Here, we present a unified and intuitive physical
picture of the ultrafast carrier dynamics and the photoconductivity, combining
optical pump - terahertz probe measurements on a gate-tunable graphene device,
with numerical calculations using the Boltzmann equation. We distinguish two
types of ultrafast photo-induced carrier heating processes: At low
(equilibrium) Fermi energy ($E_{\rm F} \lesssim$ 0.1 eV for our experiments)
broadening of the carrier distribution involves interband transitions -
interband heating. At higher Fermi energy ($E_{\rm F} \gtrsim$ 0.15 eV)
broadening of the carrier distribution involves intraband transitions -
intraband heating. Under certain conditions, additional electron-hole pairs can
be created (carrier multiplication) for low $E_{\rm F}$, and hot carriers
(hot-carrier multiplication) for higher $E_{\rm F}$. The resultant
photoconductivity is positive (negative) for low (high) $E_{\rm F}$, which
originates from the effect of the heated carrier distributions on the screening
of impurities, consistent with the DC conductivity being mostly due to impurity
scattering. The importance of these insights is highlighted by a discussion of
the implications for graphene photodetector applications.

uncertainty relation in a stochastically driven system with non-Gaussian work
statistics, both in the steady state and transient regimes, by obtaining exact
expressions for any moment of the dissipated work at arbitrary times. The
uncertainty function (the Fano factor of the dissipated work) is bounded from
below by $2k_BT$ as expected, for all times $\tau$, in both steady state and
transient regimes. The lower bound is reached at $\tau=0$ as well as when
certain system parameters vanish (corresponding to an equilibrium state).
Surprisingly, we find that the uncertainty function also reaches a constant
value at large $\tau$ for all the cases we have looked at. For a system
starting and remaining in steady state, the uncertainty function increases
monotonically, as a function of $\tau$ as well as other system parameters,
implying that the large $\tau$ value is also an upper bound. For the same
system in the transient regime, however, we find that the uncertainty function
can have a local minimum at an accessible time $\tau_m$, for a range of
parameter values. The non-monotonicity suggests, rather counter-intuitively,
that there might be an optimal time for the working of microscopic machines, as
well as an optimal configuration in the phase space of parameter values. Our
solutions show that the ratios of higher moments of the dissipated work are
also bounded from below by $2k_BT$. For another model, also solvable by our
methods, which never reaches a steady state, the uncertainty function, is in
some cases, bounded from below by a value less than $2k_BT$.

measurement of the state in the computational basis, coherence quantifies the
intrinsic randomness of the measurement outcome conditioned on all the other

characterized by the Von-Neumann entropy. In this work, we consider several

spectroscopy data at 4.4 K reveal an increasingly prominent zero bias anomaly
(ZBA). We consider two different scenarios as potential mechanisms for this
ZBA: chiral d_(x^2 -y^2 )+ id_xy wave superconductivity and a dynamical Coulomb
blockade (DCB) effect. The latter arises due to the formation of a resistive
depletion layer between the nano-domains and the substrate. Both models fit the
tunneling spectra with weaker ZBAs, while the DCB model clearly fits better to
spectra recorded at higher temperatures or from the smallest domains with the
strongest ZBA. Consistently, STS spectra from the lightly-doped substrates
display oscillatory behavior that can be attributed to conventional Coulomb
staircase behavior, which becomes stronger for smaller sized domains. We
conclude that the ZBA is predominantly due to a DCB effect, while a
superconducting instability is absent or a minor contributing factor.

to cold dark matter (e.g. in which cold dark matter is replaced by warm or
interacting DM). Using N-body simulations, we address the question of how much
information is retained from different scales in the initial linear power
spectrum following the nonlinear growth of structure. We run a suite of N-body
simulations with different initial linear matter power spectra to show that,
once the system undergoes nonlinear evolution, the shape of the linear power
spectrum at high wavenumbers does not affect the non-linear power spectrum,
while it still matters for the halo mass function. Indeed, we find that linear
power spectra which differ from one another only at wavenumbers larger than
their half-mode wavenumber give rise to (almost) identical nonlinear power
spectra at late times, regardless of the fact that they originate from
different models with damped fluctuations. On the other hand, the halo mass
function is more sensitive to the form of the linear power spectrum. Exploiting
this result, we propose a two parameter model of the transfer function in
generic damped scenarios, and show that this parametrisation works as well as
the standard three parameter models for the scales on which the linear spectrum
is relevant.

by directly applying Retinex to a hazy image whose intensities have been
inverted. In this paper, we give theoretical proof that Retinex on inverted

that at redshift $z\gtrsim 5$, the cooling by $\mathrm{LiH}$ has no effect on
the thermal evolution of shocked primordial gas, and of collapsing primordial
gas into minihaloes or relic HII regions, even if the primordial lithium
abundance were enhanced by one order of magnitude. Adding the most important
lithium species to a minimum network of primordial chemistry, we demonstrate
that insufficient $\mathrm{LiH}$ is produced in all cases considered, about
$[\mathrm{LiH/Li}]\sim 10^{-9}$ for $T\lesssim 100$ K. Indeed, $\mathrm{LiH}$
cooling would only be marginally significant in shocked primordial gas for the
highly unlikely case that the $\mathrm{LiH}$ abundance were increased by nine
orders of magnitude, implying that $all$ lithium would have to be converted
into $\mathrm{LiH}$. In this study, photo-destruction processes are not
considered, and the collisional disassociation rate of $\mathrm{LiH}$ is
possibly underestimated, rendering our results an extreme upper limit.
Therefore, the cooling by $\mathrm{LiH}$ can safely be neglected for the
thermal evolution of Population~III star-forming gas.

the extrinsic chirality arising from the mutual orientation of their anisotropy
axis and the light plane of incidence is studied. The hyperbolic regime of the
metasurfaces manifests in the amplification of the polarization rotation in the
transmitted light and in the giant enhancement of the effect in the reflected
light. The transition to this regime is frequency dependent and has the
topological nature. The key role in the optical activity enhancement belongs to
the $\sigma$-near-pole and hyperbolic $\sigma$-near-zero regimes of the
metasurfaces. The hyperbolic metasurfaces based on graphene strips or metal
disks, and a black phosphorus thin film as a natural hyperbolic layer are
considered. The efficiency of the predicted effects depends on the metasurfaces
implementation and the role of a substrate. By varying the metasurface
parameters and choosing the physical realizations it is possible to design such
a hyperbolic metasurface polarizer for the THz, infrared, and visible working
ranges. Our findings may help to improve metasurface polarizers by using them

efficient implementation of multiplicative operators in the coefficient space.
In the new theory, the signal space is embedded in a larger abstract signal
space -- the so called window-signal space. There is a canonical extension of
the wavelet transform to an isometric isomorphism between the window-signal
space and the coefficient space. Hence, the new framework is called a
wavelet-Plancherel theory, and the extended wavelet transform is called the
wavelet-Plancherel transform. Since the wavelet-Plancherel transform is an
isometric isomorphism, any operation in the coefficient space can be
pulled-back to an operation in the window-signal space. It is then possible to
improve the computational complexity of methods that involve a multiplicative
operator in the coefficient space, by performing all computations directly in
the window-signal space. As one example application, we show how continuous
wavelet multipliers (also called Calder\'{o}n-Toeplitz Operators), with
polynomial symbols, can be implemented with linear complexity in the resolution
of the 1D signal. As another example, we develop a framework for efficiently
computing greedy sparse approximations to signals based on elements of
continuous wavelet systems.

represents the date of the observation. The CNN provides good results since its
precision is 0.988 for a recall of 0.90, compared to a precision of 0.985 for

combination of probabilities given by the CNN and the random forest makes good
performance even better with a precision of 0.99 for a recall of 0.90.
  For the redshift predictions, the CNN presents excellent results which are
higher than those obtained with a feature extraction step and different
classifiers (a K-nearest-neighbors, a support vector machine, a random forest
and a gaussian process classifier). Indeed, the accuracy of the CNN within
|\Delta z|<0.1 can reach 78.09%, within |\Delta z|<0.2 reaches 86.15%, within
|\Delta z|<0.3 reaches 91.2% and the value of rms is 0.359. The performance of
the KNN decreases for the three |\Delta z| regions, since within the accuracy
of |\Delta z|<0.1, |\Delta z|<0.2 and |\Delta z|<0.3 is 73.72%, 82.46% and
90.09% respectively, and the value of rms amounts to 0.395. So the CNN
successfully reduces the dispersion and the catastrophic redshifts of quasars.

a many-body localized bulk, exhibiting nontrivial micromotion within a driving

find that non-uniform particle density profiles remain stable in the bulk up to
the longest timescales that we can access, while the propagating edge states
persist and thermalize, despite being coupled to the bulk. These findings open
the possibility of observing quantized edge transport in interacting systems at

degrees of collisional erosion to explain differences in bulk composition
between planets and chondrites. Here we undertake a full, dynamical evaluation
of 'crustal stripping' during accretion and its key geochemical consequences.
We present smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions between
differentiated rocky planetesimals and planetary embryos. We find that the
crust is preferentially lost relative to the mantle during impacts, and we have
developed a scaling law that approximates the mass of crust that remains in the
largest remnant. Using this scaling law and a recent set of N-body simulations,
we have estimated the maximum effect of crustal stripping on incompatible
element abundances during the accretion of planetary embryos. We find that on
average one third of the initial crust is stripped from embryos as they
accrete, which leads to a reduction of ~20% in the budgets of the heat
producing elements if the stripped crust does not reaccrete. Erosion of crusts
can lead to non-chondritic ratios of incompatible elements, but the magnitude
of this effect depends sensitively on the details of the crust-forming melting
process. The Lu/Hf system is fractionated for a wide range of crustal formation
scenarios. Using eucrites (the products of planetesimal silicate melting,
thought to represent the crust of Vesta) as a guide to the Lu/Hf of
planetesimal crust partially lost during accretion, we predict the Earth could
evolve to a superchondritic 176-Hf/177-Hf (3-5 parts per ten thousand) at
present day. Such values are in keeping with compositional estimates of the
bulk Earth. Stripping of planetary crusts during accretion can lead to
detectable changes in bulk composition of lithophile elements, but the
fractionation is relatively subtle, and sensitive to the efficiency of
reaccretion.

simulation without any feedback, in which the cooling halo gas is quickly
consumed in a burst of star formation. In the presence of strong supernovae
(SN) feedback, we observe the formation of a galactic fountain that regulates
star formation over a longer period, but without halting it. If only AGN
feedback is considered, as soon as the SMBH reaches a critical mass, strong
outflows of hot gas are launched and prevent the cooling halo gas from reaching

unbind dense gas from the galactic halo, thanks to the combined effect of SN

over time, similar to stellar winds) is crucial in generating a reasonable ISM
structure and galactic winds and in regulating dwarf stellar masses. However,
once SNe are discretized, accounting for the effects of IMF sampling on
continuous mechanisms such as radiative feedback and stellar mass-loss (as
opposed to adopting IMF-averaged rates) has weak effects on galaxy-scale
properties. We also consider the effects of rare HNe events with energies $\sim
10^{53}\,{\rm erg}$. The effects of HNe are similar to the effects of clustered
explosions of SNe -- which are already captured in our default simulation setup

conformity in three galaxy properties, $(g-r)$ colour, specific star formation

conformity signals with a suite of mock galaxy catalogues that have no built-in
conformity, but contain the same group-finding and mass assignment errors as

signals at all group masses. However, these signals are equally strong in mock
catalogues, indicating that the conformity signal is spurious and likely
entirely caused by group-finding systematics, calling into question previous
claims of 1-halo conformity detection. The MCF reveals a significant detection
of radial segregation within massive groups, but no evidence of conformity. In
the case of 2-halo conformity, quenched fractions show no significant evidence
of conformity in colour or sSFR once compared with mock catalogues, but a clear
signal using morphology. In contrast, the MCF reveals a small, yet highly

a diverse evolution which is guided by the ability of parent haloes to absorb
angular momentum lost by the disc through the action of gravitational torques,
resonant and non-resonant. We confirm the previous claim that dynamical bar
instability is accelerated via resonant angular momentum transfer to the halo.
Our main findings relate to the long-term, secular evolution of disc-halo
systems: with an increasing lambda, bars experience less growth and dissolve
after they pass through the vertical buckling instability. Specifically, with
an increasing halo spin, (1) The vertical buckling instability in stellar bars
colludes with inability of the inner halo to absorb angular momentum --- this
emerges as the main factor weakening or destroying bars in spinning haloes; (2)
Bars lose progressively less angular momentum, and their pattern speeds level
off; (3) Bars are smaller, and for lambda >= 0.06 cease their growth completely
following buckling; (4) Bars in lambda > 0.03 haloes have ratio of
corotation-to-bar radii, R_CR / R_b > 2, and represent so-called slow bars
which do not show offset dust lanes. We provide a quantitative analysis of
angular momentum transfer in disc-halo systems, and explain the reasons for
absence of growth in fast spinning haloes and its observational corollaries. We
conclude that stellar bar evolution is substantially more complex than
anticipated, and bars are not as resilient as has been considered so far.

the very faint X-ray transient and black hole system Swift J1357.2-0933 during
an early low hard state of its 2017 outburst. Swift J1357.2-0933 was observed
at $\sim$0.02% of the Eddington luminosity (for a distance of 2.3 kpc and a
mass of 4 M$_{\odot}$). Despite the low luminosity, the broadband X-ray
spectrum between 0.3 and 78 keV requires the presence of a disk blackbody
component with an inner disk temperature of T$_{\mathrm{in}}$ $\sim$ 0.06 keV
in addition to a thermal Comptonization component with a photon index of
{\Gamma} $\sim$ 1.70. Using a more physical model, which takes strong
relativistic effects into account, and assuming a high inclination of
70$^\circ$, which is motivated by the presence of dips in optical light curves,
we find that the accretion disk is truncated within a few RISCO from the black
hole, independent of the spin.

promising avenue towards understanding the computational power of quantum
systems. Whether a class of quantum circuits can be efficiently simulated with
a probabilistic classical computer, or is provably hard to simulate, depends
quite critically on the precise notion of ""classical simulation"" and in
particular on the required accuracy. We argue that a notion of classical
simulation, which we call epsilon-simulation, captures the essence of
possessing ""equivalent computational power"" as the quantum system it simulates:
It is statistically impossible to distinguish an agent with access to an
epsilon-simulator from one possessing the simulated quantum system. We relate
epsilon-simulation to various alternative notions of simulation predominantly
focusing on a simulator we call a poly-box. A poly-box outputs 1/poly precision
additive estimates of Born probabilities and marginals. This notion of
simulation has gained prominence through a number of recent simulability
results. Accepting some plausible computational theoretic assumptions, we show
that epsilon-simulation is strictly stronger than a poly-box by showing that
IQP circuits and unconditioned magic-state injected Clifford circuits are both
hard to epsilon-simulate and yet admit a poly-box. In contrast, we also show
that these two notions are equivalent under an additional assumption on the
sparsity of the output distribution (poly-sparsity).

multi-wavelength transit observation, which measures an apparent decrease in
stellar brightness during planetary transit in front of its host star (called
transit depth). Sets of transit depths so far measured at different wavelengths
(called transmission spectra) are somewhat diverse: Some show steep spectral
slope features in the visible, some contain featureless spectra in the
near-infrared, some show distinct features from radiative absorption by gaseous
species. These facts infer the existence of haze in the atmospheres especially
of warm, relatively low-density super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Previous
studies that addressed theoretical modeling of transmission spectra of
hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with haze used some assumed distribution and
size of haze particles. In this study, we model the atmospheric chemistry,
derive the spatial and size distributions of haze particles by simulating the
creation, growth and settling of hydrocarbon haze particles directly, and
develop transmission spectrum models of UV-irradiated, solar-abundance
atmospheres of close-in warm ($\sim$ 500 K) exoplanets. We find that the haze
is distributed in the atmosphere much more broadly than previously assumed and
consists of particles of various sizes. We also demonstrate that the observed
diversity of transmission spectra can be explained by the difference in the
production rate of haze monomers, which is related to the UV irradiation
intensity from host stars.

post-burst. We present new, deep Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A at

emission has brightened from a 0.3-8.0 keV flux of 3.6 x 10^-15 erg/s/cm^2 at
16 days to 15.8 x 10^-15 erg/s/cm^2 at 109 days, at a rate similar to the radio

origin. We show that the X-ray light curve is consistent with models of outflow
afterglows, in which the outflow can be a cocoon shocked by the jet, dynamical
ejecta from the merger, or an off-axis structured jet. Further deep X-ray
monitoring can place powerful constraints on the physical parameters of these
models, by both timing the passing of a synchrotron cooling break through the
X-ray band, and detecting the associated steepening of the X-ray photon index.
Finally, the X-ray brightening strengthens the argument that simple off-axis
top-hat jet models are not consistent with the latest observations of

interactions (SPI) are observable with a wide variety of photometric,
spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric studies. At such close distances, the
planet orbits within the sub-alfv\'enic radius of the star in which the
transfer of energy and angular momentum between the two bodies is particularly
efficient. The magnetic interactions appear as enhanced stellar activity
modulated by the planet as it orbits the star rather than only by stellar
rotation. These SPI effects are informative for the study of the internal
dynamics and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets. The nature of magnetic SPI is
modeled to be strongly affected by both the stellar and planetary magnetic
fields, possibly influencing the magnetic activity of both, as well as
affecting the irradiation and even the migration of the planet and rotational
evolution of the star. As phase-resolved observational techniques are applied
to a large statistical sample of hot Jupiter systems, extensions to other
tightly orbiting stellar systems, such as smaller planets close to M dwarfs
become possible. In these systems, star-planet separations of tens of stellar

evaluate our new approach and show that it achieves state-of-the-art

selective localization of biological molecules at the subcellular level only

cell walls allows the assessment of the differences in their compositions
providing a tool to analise the quality of different plants. For its
quantization one requires a laborious manual labeling (or annotation) of images
containing hundreds of particles. The system that is proposed in this paper can
leverage significantly the burden of this manual task.
  For particle detection we use a LoG filter coupled with a SDA. In order to
improve the recognition, we also study the applicability of TL settings for
immunogold recognition. TL reuses the learning model of a source problem on
other datasets (target problems) containing particles of different sizes. The
proposed system was developed to solve a particular problem on maize cells,
namely to determine the composition of cell wall ingrowths in endosperm
transfer cells. This novel dataset as well as the code for reproducing our

algorithms to extract useful knowledge. However, there are cases where this is
not possible because the graph is \textit{hidden} or \textit{implicit}, meaning
that the edges are not recorded explicitly in the form of an adjacency

\textit{edge probing queries} asking for the existence or not of a particular

the number of nodes). Thus, our objective is to pose as few edge probing

While an explanation for the improved ductility exists, the observed effect on
strength remains unexplained. In this work, we use atomistic simulations to
explore the influence of ordered and disordered complexions on two deformation
mechanisms which are essential for nanocrystalline plasticity, namely
dislocation emission and propagation. Both ordered and disordered grain
boundary complexions in Cu-Zr are characterized by excess free volume and
promote dislocation emission by reducing the critical emission stress.
Alternatively, these complexions are characterized by strong dislocation
pinning regions that increase the flow stress required for dislocation
propagation. Such pinning regions are caused by ledges and solute atoms at the
grain-complexion interfaces and may be dependent on the complexion state as
well as the atomic size mismatch between the matrix and solute elements. The
trends observed in our simulations of dislocation propagation align with the
available experimental data, suggesting that dislocation propagation is the
rate-limiting mechanism behind plasticity in nanocrystalline Cu-Zr alloys.

HCI post-processing from an unsupervised to a supervised learning context. In
this new framework, we present algorithmic solutions using two different

diffraction limit, SODINN improves the true positive rate by a factor ranging

signals (genes truly over or under expressed) are ""competing"" with fairly large
type I error signals. False positives near the top of a sorted list can occur
when genes having very small fold-change are compensated by small enough
variance to yield a large test statistic. One of the first attempts around this
caveat as the development of ""significance analysis of micro-arrays (SAM)"",
which used a modified t-type statistic thresholded against its permutation
distribution. The key innovation of the modified t-statistic was the addition
of a constant to the per gene standard errors in order to stabilize the
coefficient of variation of the resulting test statistic. Since then, several
authors have proposed the use of shrinkage variance estimators in conjunction
with t-type, and more generally, ANOVA type tests at the gene level. Our new
approach proposes the use of a shrinkage variance Hotelling T-squared statistic
in which the per gene sample covariance matrix is replaced by a shrinkage
estimate borrowing strength from across all genes. It is demonstrated that the
new statistic retains the F-distribution under the null, with added degrees of
freedom in the denominator. Advantages of this class of tests are (i)
flexibility in that a whole family of hypothesis tests is possible (ii) the
gains of the above-mentioned earlier innovations are enjoyed more fully. This

the Mediterranean small island state of Malta. The services included in this

livestock production, crop pollination, air quality regulation, and aesthetic
ES. This assessment develops different spatial models, which make use of
available datasets, causal relationships between datasets, including a
generated land use land cover (LULC) map, and statistical models and indicators

and compare their spatial patterns across the case study area. Subsequently, an
analysis of ES associations and bundles was carried out using Pearson
parametric correlation test, for both ES capacity and flow indicators generated
from this study, and through Principal Component Analysis. Results demonstrate
several significant synergistic interactions between ES capacity and flow in
rural landscapes characterised with agricultural and semi-natural LULC
categories, indicating high landscape multifunctionality. In contrast,
predominantly urban areas tend to be characterised with a low ecosystem
capacity and ES flow, suggesting that ES delivery in the landscapes of the
study area is determined by land use intensity. These findings support the
notion that multifunctional rural landscapes provide multiple ES, making an
important contribution to human well-being, and that land use planning that
develops green infrastructure in urban areas can significantly contribute to
support biodiversity and ES delivery.

neural network (CNN) based regularization prior. The proposed formulation
provides a systematic approach for deriving deep architectures for inverse
problems with the arbitrary structure. Since the forward model is explicitly
accounted for, a smaller network with fewer parameters is sufficient to capture
the image information compared to black-box deep learning approaches, thus
reducing the demand for training data and training time. Since we rely on
end-to-end training, the CNN weights are customized to the forward model, thus
offering improved performance over approaches that rely on pre-trained
denoisers. The main difference of the framework from existing end-to-end
training strategies is the sharing of the network weights across iterations and
channels. Our experiments show that the decoupling of the number of iterations
from the network complexity offered by this approach provides benefits
including lower demand for training data, reduced risk of overfitting, and
implementations with significantly reduced memory footprint. We propose to
enforce data-consistency by using numerical optimization blocks such as
conjugate gradients algorithm within the network; this approach offers faster
convergence per iteration, compared to methods that rely on proximal gradients
steps to enforce data consistency. Our experiments show that the faster
convergence translates to improved performance, especially when the available
GPU memory restricts the number of iterations.

use of two different kinds of subwavelength resonators, which may limit the
applicability of double-negative metamaterials. Herein, we rely on media that
consist of only a single type of dielectric resonant element, and show how the
chirality of the background medium induces double-negative refractive index
metamaterial, which refracts waves negatively, hence acting as a superlens.
Using plasmonic dielectric particles, it is proved that both the effective
electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability can be negative near some
resonant frequencies. A justification of the approximation of a plasmonic
particle in a chiral medium by the sum of a resonant electric dipole and a
resonant magnetic dipole, is provided. Moreover, the set of resonant
frequencies is characterized. For an appropriate volume fraction of plasmonic

cathode's negative bias and accelerates upstream ions into the cathode. Here,
we formulate a fundamentally different current-limited mode. In the ""inverse""
mode, the potentials of both electrodes are above the plasma potential, so that
the plasma ions are confined. The bias is consumed by the anode sheath. There
is no potential gradient in the neutral plasma region from resistivity or
presheath. The inverse cathode sheath pulls some thermoelectrons back to the
cathode, thereby limiting the circuit current. Thermoelectrons entering the
zero-field plasma region that undergo collisions may also be sent back to the
cathode, further attenuating the circuit current. In planar geometry, the
plasma density is shown to vary linearly across the electrode gap. A continuum
kinetic planar plasma diode simulation model is set up to compare the
properties of current modes with classical, conventional SCL, and inverse
cathode sheaths. SCL modes can exist only if charge-exchange collisions are
turned off in the potential well of the virtual cathode to prevent ion
trapping. With the collisions, the current-limited equilibrium must be inverse.
Inverse operating modes should therefore be present or possible in many plasma
devices that rely on hot cathodes. Evidence from past experiments is discussed.
The inverse mode may offer opportunities to minimize sputtering and power
consumption that were not previously explored due to the common assumption of
SCL sheaths.

application (atom) can have an Object IDentifier (OID) and descriptors that may
be positional arguments (tuples) or attribute-value pairs (slots). PSOA RuleML
explicitly specifies for each descriptor whether it is to be interpreted under
the perspective of the predicate in whose scope it occurs. This
predicate-dependency dimension refines the space between oidless, positional
atoms (relationships) and oidful, slotted atoms (framepoints): While
relationships use only a predicate-scope-sensitive (predicate-dependent) tuple
and framepoints use only predicate-scope-insensitive (predicate-independent)
slots, PSOA uses a systematics of orthogonal constructs also permitting atoms
with (predicate-)independent tuples and atoms with (predicate-)dependent slots.
This supports data and knowledge representation where a slot attribute can have
different values depending on the predicate. PSOA thus extends object-oriented
multi-membership and multiple inheritance. Based on objectification, PSOA laws
are given: Besides unscoping and centralization, the semantic restriction and
transformation of describution permits rescoping of one atom's independent
descriptors to another atom with the same OID but a different predicate. For
inheritance, default descriptors are realized by rules. On top of a metamodel
and a Grailog visualization, PSOA's atom systematics for facts, queries, and
rules is explained. The presentation and (XML-)serialization syntaxes of PSOA
RuleML are introduced. Its model-theoretic semantics is formalized by extending
the interpretation functions for dependent descriptors. The open-source

the dynamic behavior of system failure. These DFTs are then analyzed
qualitatively and quantitatively using stochastic or algebraic methods to judge
the failure characteristics of the given system in terms of the failures of its
sub-components. Model checking has been recently proposed to conduct the
failure analysis of systems using DFTs with the motivation to provide a
rigorous failure analysis of safety-critical systems. However, model checking
has not been used for the DFT qualitative analysis and the reduction algorithms
used in model checking are usually not formally verified. Moreover, the
analysis time grows exponentially with the increase of the number of states.
These issues limit the usefulness of model checking for analyzing complex
systems used in safety-critical domains, where the accuracy and completeness of
analysis matters the most. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
comprehensive methodology to perform the qualitative and quantitative analysis
of DFTs using an integration of theorem proving and model checking based
approaches. For this purpose, we formalized all the basic dynamic fault tree
gates using higher-order logic based on the algebraic approach and formally
verified some of the simplification properties. This formalization allows us to
formally verify the equivalence between the original and reduced DFTs using a
theorem prover, and conduct the qualitative analysis. We then use model
checking to perform the quantitative analysis of the formally verified reduced
DFT. We applied our methodology to five benchmarks and the results show that
the formally verified reduced DFT was analyzed using model checking with up to
six times less states and up to 133000 times faster.

and the variance of the smoothed overdensity field. In LCDM cosmologies not
accounting for massive neutrinos, it has already been proved to be independent
from bias and redshift space distortions on a range of linear scales. It
therefore allows for a direct comparison of measurements (from galaxies in
redshift space) to predictions (for matter in real space). In this paper we
first extend the applicability of such properties of the clustering ratio to
cosmologies that include massive neutrinos, by performing tests against
simulated data. We then investigate the constraining power of the clustering
ratio when cosmological parameters such as the total neutrino mass and the
equation of state of dark energy are left free. We analyse the joint posterior
distribution of the parameters that must satisfy, at the same time, the
measurements of the galaxy clustering ratio in the SDSS DR12, and the angular
power spectrum of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB measured
by the Planck satellite. We find the clustering ratio to be very sensitive to
the CDM density parameter, but not very much so to the total neutrino mass.
Lastly, we forecast the constraining power the clustering ratio will achieve
with forthcoming surveys, predicting the amplitude of its errors in a
Euclid-like galaxy survey. In this case, we find it is expected to improve the

the equality function on two $n$-bit strings in the simultaneous message
passing model. The original quantum fingerprinting protocol uses a tensor
product of a small number of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-qubit high dimensional
signals [Buhrman et al. 2001], whereas a recently-proposed optical protocol
uses a tensor product of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ single-qubit signals, while
maintaining the $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ information leakage of the original
protocol [Arrazola and L\""utkenhaus 2014]. We find a family of protocols which
interpolate between the original and optical protocols while maintaining the
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ information leakage, thus demonstrating a trade-off
between the number of signals sent and the dimension of each signal.
  There has been interest in experimental realization of the recently-proposed
optical protocol using coherent states [Xu et al. 2015, Guan et al. 2016], but
as the required number of laser pulses grows linearly with the input size $n$,
eventual challenges for the long-time stability of experimental set-ups arise.
We find a coherent state protocol which reduces the number of signals by a
factor $1/2$ while also reducing the information leakage. Our reduction makes
use of a simple modulation scheme in optical phase space, and we find that more
complex modulation schemes are not advantageous. Using a similar technique, we
improve a recently-proposed coherent state protocol for evaluating the
Euclidean distance between two real unit vectors [Kumar et al. 2017] by
reducing the number of signals by a factor $1/2$ and also reducing the

can activate our interests and mobilize our actions. The degree to which a
story resonates with its audience may be in part reflected in the emotional
journey it takes the audience upon. In this paper, we use machine learning
methods to construct emotional arcs in movies, calculate families of arcs, and
demonstrate the ability for certain arcs to predict audience engagement. The
system is applied to Hollywood films and high quality shorts found on the web.
We begin by using deep convolutional neural networks for audio and visual
sentiment analysis. These models are trained on both new and existing
large-scale datasets, after which they can be used to compute separate audio
and visual emotional arcs. We then crowdsource annotations for 30-second video
clips extracted from highs and lows in the arcs in order to assess the
micro-level precision of the system, with precision measured in terms of
agreement in polarity between the system's predictions and annotators' ratings.
These annotations are also used to combine the audio and visual predictions.
Next, we look at macro-level characterizations of movies by investigating
whether there exist `universal shapes' of emotional arcs. In particular, we
develop a clustering approach to discover distinct classes of emotional arcs.
Finally, we show on a sample corpus of short web videos that certain emotional
arcs are statistically significant predictors of the number of comments a video
receives. These results suggest that the emotional arcs learned by our approach
successfully represent macroscopic aspects of a video story that drive audience
engagement. Such machine understanding could be used to predict audience
reactions to video stories, ultimately improving our ability as storytellers to
communicate with each other.

these subtle clues or features given an appropriate representation of the
music. In this paper, we apply a deep convolutional neural network to a large
audio dataset and empirically evaluate its performance on audio classification
tasks. Our trained network demonstrates accurate performance on such
classification tasks when presented with 5 s examples of music obtained by
simple transformations of the raw audio waveform. A particularly interesting
example is the spectral representation of music obtained by application of a
logarithmically spaced filter bank, mirroring the early stages of auditory
signal transduction in mammals. The most successful representation of music to
facilitate discrimination was obtained via a random matrix transform (RMT).
Networks based on logarithmic filter banks and RMT were able to correctly guess

networks and controlling the phase and frequency of individual oscillators
using similar or other types of oscillators. Here, we present the first
demonstration of injection locking of a radiation-pressure driven
optomechanical oscillator (OMO) via acoustic waves. As opposed to previously
reported techniques (based on pump modulation or direct application of a
modulated electrostatic force), injection locking of OMO via acoustic waves
does not require optical power modulation or physical contact with the OMO and
it can easily be implemented on various platforms. Using this approach we have
locked the phase and frequency of two distinct modes of a microtoroidal silica
OMO to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). We have characterized the behavior of
the injection locked OMO with three acoustic excitation configurations and
showed that even without proper acoustic impedance matching the OMO can be
locked to the PZT and tuned over 17 kHz with only -30 dBm of RF power fed to
the PZT. The high efficiency, simplicity and scalability of the proposed
approach paves the road toward a new class of photonic systems that rely on
synchronization of several OMOs to a single or multiple RF oscillators with
applications in optical communication, metrology and sensing. Beyond its
practical applications, injection locking via acoustic waves can be used in
fundamental studies in quantum optomechanics where thermal and optical
isolation of the OMO are critical.

either via (nearly) spherically symmetric stellar winds or by aspherical
mass-loss mechanisms, namely the outflowing equatorial disks. However, the
scenario that leads to the formation of a disk or rings of gas and dust around
massive stars is still under debate. Aims. We study the hydrodynamic and
thermal structure of optically thick, dense parts of outflowing circumstellar
disks that may be formed around various types of critically rotating massive
stars, for example, Be stars, B[e] supergiant (sgB[e]) stars or Pop III stars.
Methods. We specify the optical depth of the disk along the line-of-sight from
stellar poles. Within the optically thick dense region we calculate the
vertical disk thermal structure using the diffusion approximation while for the
optically thin outer layers we assume a local thermodynamic equilibrium with
the impinging stellar irradiation. We use two of our own types of hydrodynamic
codes: two-dimensional operator-split numerical code and unsplit code based on
the Roe's method. Results. Our models show the geometric distribution and
contribution of viscous heating that begins to dominate in the central part of
the disk. In the models of dense viscous disks the viscosity increases the
central temperature up to several tens of thousands of Kelvins. The high
mass-loss rates and high viscosity lead to instabilities with significant waves
or bumps in density and temperature in the very inner disk region. Conclusions.
The two-dimensional radial-vertical models of dense outflowing disks including
the full Navier-Stokes viscosity terms show very high temperatures that are
however limited to only the central disk cores inside the optically thick area,
while near the edge of the optically thick region the temperature may be low
enough for the existence of neutral hydrogen.

the idea of sharing underused resources and services, e.g. transportation and

reduction in the cost of electricity storage, we look into the potential
opportunity in electrical power system where consumers share storage with each
other. We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, consumers
are assumed to already have individual storage devices and they explore
cooperation to minimize the realized electricity consumption cost. In the
second scenario, a group of consumers is interested to invest in joint storage
capacity and operate it cooperatively. The resulting system problems are
modeled using cooperative game theory. In both cases, the cooperative games are
shown to have non-empty cores and we develop efficient cost allocations in the
core with analytical expressions. Thus, sharing of storage in cooperative

discover several unexpected phenomena, which show that, in both techniques,
there are large gaps between the VC-dimension (and primal shatter dimension),
and the combinatorial dimension.
  For vertical decomposition, the combinatorial dimension is only $2d$, the
primal shatter dimension is at most $d(d+1)$, and the VC-dimension is at least
$1 + d(d+1)/2$ and at most $O(d^3)$. For bottom-vertex triangulation, both the
primal shatter dimension and the combinatorial dimension are $\Theta(d^2)$, but
there seems to be a significant gap between them, as the combinatorial

$d(d+1)$, and the VC-dimension is between $d(d+1)$ and $5d^2 \log{d}$ (for

  Our main application is to point location in an arrangement of $n$

bottom-vertex triangulation, at the cost of some increase in the preprocessing
cost and storage. The best query time that we can obtain is $O(d^3\log n)$,
instead of $O(d^4\log d\log n)$ in Meiser's algorithm. For these bounds to
hold, the preprocessing and storage are rather large (super-exponential in

nanophotonic waveguide for application to quantum nondemolition (QND)
measurement of atomic spins. Here the cooperativity per atom is determined by
the ratio between the measurement strength and the decoherence rate.
Counterintuitively, we find that by placing the atoms at an azimuthal position
where the guided probe mode has the lowest intensity, we increase the
cooperativity. This arises because the QND measurement strength depends on the
interference between the probe and scattered light guided into an orthogonal
polarization mode, while the decoherence rate depends on the local intensity of
the probe. Thus, by proper choice of geometry, the ratio of good to bad
scattering can be strongly enhanced for highly anisotropic modes. We apply this
to study spin squeezing resulting from QND measurement of spin projection noise
via the Faraday effect in two nanophotonic geometries, a cylindrical nanofiber
and a square waveguide. We find that, with about 2500 atoms and using realistic
experimental parameters, $ \sim 6.3 $ and $ \sim 13 $ dB of squeezing can be
achieved on the nanofiber and square waveguide, respectively.

analyze a proposal for enhancement and manipulation of optical nonlinearity and
high-order sideband generation in a hybrid atom-cavity optomechanical system
that is coherently driven by a bichromatic input field consisting of a control
field and a probe field and works beyond the perturbative regime. Our numerical
analysis with experimentally achievable parameters confirms that robust
high-order sideband generation and typical spectral structures with
non-perturbative features can be created even under weak driven fields. The
dependence of the high-order sideband generation on the atomic parameters are
also discussed in detail, including the decay rate of the atoms and the
coupling parameter between the atoms and the cavity field. We show that the
cutoff order as well as the amplitude of the higher order sidebands can be well
tuned by the atomic coupling strength and the atomic decay rate. The proposed
mechanism of enhancing optical nonlinearity is quite general and can be adopted
to optomechanical systems with different types of cavity.

variables; $s$ resource cells (of unit area) that represent energy-consuming
geographic or spatial zones (e.g. land, housing or infrastructure etc.) and a
population comprising $n$ mobile units that can migrate between these cells. We
show that with a constant metropolis area (fixed $s$), the variance and entropy
of consumed energy initially increase with $n$, reach a maximum and then
eventually diminish to zero as saturation is reached. These metrics are
indicators of the spatial mobility of the population. Under certain situations,
the variance is bounded as a quadratic function of the mean consumed energy of
the metropolis. However, when population and metropolis area are endogenous,
growth in the latter is arrested when $n\leq\frac{s}{2}\log(s)$ due to
diminished population density. Conversely, the population growth reaches
equilibrium when $n\geq {s}\log{n}$ or equivalently when the aggregate of both
over-populated and under-populated areas is large. Moreover, we also draw the
relationship between our approach and multi-scalar information, when economic
dependency between a metropolis's sub-regions is based on the entropy of

Hence, it is possible to comparatively accurately detect scene changes between

of cameras mounted on a moving object, such as ground and aerial vehicles, we
must consider the spatial correspondence between the images captured at
different times. However, it can be difficult to accurately estimate the camera

solve this problem, we propose a change detection convolutional neural network

robustness properties of the networks of interest. We compare three possible
discrete notions of Ricci curvature (Olivier Ricci curvature, Bakry-\'Emery

real biological networks are almost always directed and possess positive and
negative controls, the notion of signed-control curvature can elucidate the

in which particle interactions are frictionless and near elastic. However, it
fails when particle interactions become frictional and inelastic. For example,
the KT is not able to accurately predict the free cooling process of a vibrated
granular medium that consists of inelastic frictional particles under
microgravity. The main reason that the classical KT fails to model these flows
is due to its inability to account for the particle surface friction and its
inelastic behavior, which are the two most important factors that need be
considered in modeling collisional granular flows. In this study, we have
modified the KT model that is able to incorporate these two factors. The
inelasticity of a particle is considered by establishing a velocity-dependent
expression for the restitution coefficient based on many experimental studies
found in the literature, and the particle friction effect is included by using
a tangential restitution coefficient that is related to the particle friction
coefficient. Theoretical predictions of the free cooling process by the
classical KT and the improved KT are compared with the experimental results
from a study conducted on an airplane undergoing parabolic flights without the
influence of gravity [Y. Grasselli, G. Bossis, and G. Goutallier, EPL
(Europhysics Letters) 86, 60007 (2009)]. Our results show that both the
velocity- dependent restitution coefficient and the particle surface friction
are important in predicting the free cooling process of granular flows; the
modified KT model that integrates these two factors is able to improve the
simulation results and led to a better agreement with the experimental results.

non-smooth objective functions because of binarization. In addition, we propose
to incorporate independence and balance properties in the direct and strict

property in our objective functions. The resulting optimizations involving
these binary, independence, and balance constraints are difficult to solve. To
tackle this difficulty, we propose to learn the networks with alternating

neither observational systematics nor new physics has been successfully
implemented to explain this tension away. This paper present a new solution to
the Hubble constant problem. The solution is based on the Simsilun simulation
(relativistic simulation of the large scale structure of the Universe) with the
ray-tracing algorithm implemented. The initial conditions for the Simsilun
simulation were set up as perturbations around the $\Lambda$CDM model. However,
unlike in the Standard Cosmological Model (i.e. $\Lambda$CDM model +
perturbations), within the Simsilun simulation relativistic and nonlinear
evolution of cosmic structures leads to the phenomenon of emerging spatial
curvature, where the mean spatial curvature evolves from spatial flatness of
the early universe towards slightly curved present-day universe. Consqeuently,
the present-day expansion rate is slightly faster compared to the spatially
flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The results of the ray-tracing analysis show that the
universe which starts with initial conditions consistent with the Planck
constraints should have the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72.5 \pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$. When the Simsilun simulation was re-run with no inhomogeneities
imposed, the Hubble constant inferred within such a homogeneous simulation was
$H_0 = 68.1 \pm 2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Thus, the inclusion of nonlinear
relativistic evolution that leads to the emergence of the spatial curvature can
explain why the low-redshift measurements favour higher values compared to
high-redshift constraints and alleviate the tension between the CMB and

to overcome security and privacy challenges of Internet of Things (IoT).
However, BC is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs
significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited to the IoT
context. We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized
for IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a
representative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a
smart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for
communication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves
decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices
jointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The
overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster
heads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several
optimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed
trust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is
resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB
decreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to
relevant baselines.

recruitment market analysis largely rely on the knowledge of domain experts and
classic statistical models, which are usually too general to model large-scale
dynamic recruitment data, and have difficulties to capture the fine-grained
market trends. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new research paradigm
for recruitment market analysis by leveraging unsupervised learning techniques
for automatically discovering recruitment market trends based on large-scale

model, named MTLVM, which is designed for capturing the sequential dependencies

recruitment topics within a Bayesian generative framework. In particular, to
capture the variability of recruitment topics over time, we design hierarchical
dirichlet processes for MTLVM. These processes allow to dynamically generate
the evolving recruitment topics. Finally, we implement a prototype system to
empirically evaluate our approach based on real-world recruitment data in

Standard denoiser suffers from the error amplification effect, in which small
residual adversarial noise is progressively amplified and leads to wrong
classifications. HGD overcomes this problem by using a loss function defined as
the difference between the target model's outputs activated by the clean image
and denoised image. Compared with ensemble adversarial training which is the
state-of-the-art defending method on large images, HGD has three advantages.
First, with HGD as a defense, the target model is more robust to either
white-box or black-box adversarial attacks. Second, HGD can be trained on a
small subset of the images and generalizes well to other images and unseen
classes. Third, HGD can be transferred to defend models other than the one
guiding it. In NIPS competition on defense against adversarial attacks, our HGD
solution won the first place and outperformed other models by a large margin.

  2018",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral Clustering (SC) is a widely used data clustering method which first
learns a low-dimensional embedding $U$ of data by computing the eigenvectors of
the normalized Laplacian matrix, and then performs k-means on $U^\top$ to get
the final clustering result. The Sparse Spectral Clustering (SSC) method
extends SC with a sparse regularization on $UU^\top$ by using the block
diagonal structure prior of $UU^\top$ in the ideal case. However, encouraging
$UU^\top$ to be sparse leads to a heavily nonconvex problem which is
challenging to solve and the work (Lu, Yan, and Lin 2016) proposes a convex
relaxation in the pursuit of this aim indirectly. However, the convex
relaxation generally leads to a loose approximation and the quality of the
solution is not clear. This work instead considers to solve the nonconvex
formulation of SSC which directly encourages $UU^\top$ to be sparse. We propose
an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the
nonconvex SSC and provide the convergence guarantee. In particular, we prove
that the sequences generated by ADMM always exist a limit point and any limit
point is a stationary point. Our analysis does not impose any assumptions on
the iterates and thus is practical. Our proposed ADMM for nonconvex problems
allows the stepsize to be increasing but upper bounded, and this makes it very
efficient in practice. Experimental analysis on several real data sets verifies
the effectiveness of our method.

loss of lives and property. The stability of rock slopes is often dominated by
one or more locked segments along a potential slip surface; these segments have
relatively high strength and accumulate strain energy. Locked segments can be
preliminarily classified into three categories: ""rock bridge"", ""retaining wall""
and ""sustaining arch."" Coupling a one-dimensional renormalization group model
with the strain-softening constitutive relation of geo-materials considering
the Weibull's distribution, a physical model for predicting the instability of
slopes with locked segments is established. It is found that the ratio of the
strain or displacement at the peak strength point to that at the volume
dilation point for a locked segment is exclusively dependent on the Weibull's
shape parameter m, and is approximately constant at 1.48. A corresponding
accelerating displacement increment (tertiary creep) of the slope can be
observed from the onset of the volume dilation of the locked segment due to its
unsteady cracking. For a slope with multiple locked segments, one can predict
its critical instability displacement value according to the accelerating
displacement onset corresponding to the volume dilation point of the first
locked segment and the number of locked segments. The back-analysis of two
typical cases, the Yanchihe rockslide in China and the wedge rockslide, Libby
Dam, USA, shows that their evolutionary processes, dominated respectively by
one and two locked segments, follow this model, confirming the reliability of
the proposed model.

Traditional approaches for company profiling rely heavily on the availability

However, the rapid prevalence of online employment services enables a new
paradigm - to obtain the variety of company's information from their employees'

company profiles from an employee's perspective. To this end, in this paper, we
propose a method named Company Profiling based Collaborative Topic Regression

formulating a joint optimization framework, CPCTR has the ability in
collaboratively modeling both textual (e.g., reviews) and numerical information
(e.g., salaries and ratings). Indeed, with the identified patterns, including
the positive/negative opinions and the latent variable that influences salary,
we can effectively carry out opinion analysis and salary prediction. Extensive

effectiveness of CPCTR. The results show that our method provides a
comprehensive understanding of company characteristics and delivers a more

frame, combined with a fast sample transfer method, such that in-situ
microscopy can be utilized after subsequent deposition pulses. The in-situ
microscope can be operated from room temperature (RT) up to 700$^\circ$C and at

performance of this instrument is demonstrated by resolving unit cell height
surface steps and surface topography under typical oxide PLD growth conditions.

cover more than $1$ precession period and about 15 orbits up to merger. We
discuss the spin precession dynamics by analyzing coordinate trajectories,
quasi-local spin measurements, and energetics, by comparing spin aligned,
antialigned, and irrotational configurations. Gravitational waveforms from
different spin configuration are compared by calculating the mismatch between
pairs of waveforms in the late inspiral. We find that precession effects are
not distinguishable from nonprecessing configurations with aligned spins for
approximately face-on binaries, while the latter are distinguishable from a
nonspinning configurations. Spin precession effects are instead clearly visible
for approximately edge-on binaries.
  For the parameters considered here, precession does not significantly affect
the characteristic postmerger gravitational-wave frequencies nor the mass
ejection. Our results pave the way for the modeling of spin precession effects

They come in two flavours, depending whether the EEG/MEG forward model
considers explicitly ""interfering activity"", understood as brain's electrical
activity originating from brain areas other than regions of interest which is
recorded at EEG/MEG sensors as a signal correlated with activity of interest.
In both cases, the proposed filters are equipped with a rank-selection
criterion minimizing the mean-square-error (MSE) of the filter output.
Therefore, we consider them as novel nontrivial generalizations of well-known
linearly constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) and nulling filters. The proposed
filters have equally wide area of applications, which include in particular
evaluation of directed connectivity measures based on the reconstructed
activity of sources of interest, considered in this paper as a sample
application. Moreover, in order to facilitate reproducibility of our research,
we provide (jointly with this paper) comprehensive simulation framework that
allows for estimation of error of signal reconstruction for a number of spatial

amount of gathered data from the oil field is required. However, it is not
always possible to acquire such data at the initial stage of project
development. Buckley and Leverett (1942) developed the analytical solution
allowing to assess the oil displacement efficiency. One of the main assumptions
of this model is incompressibility of oil and injected fluid. For slightly
compressible water and oil such assumption is rational. However, that is not
always the case when the gas is injected. This research aims to identify the
conditions at which the usage of the incompressible gas model is appropriate.
Likewise, the cases when the model of compressible gas is required are also
evaluated. To accomplish the goals of this research, the comparative analysis
between the injection of compressible and incompressible gases was undertaken
using the numerical solution of the correspondent reservoir engineering
problem. The validation of the numerical model was undertaken showing that it
matches the analytical Buckley-Leverett solution. The findings of this research
indicate that the relative and absolute density change with the pressure of the
injected gas has the profound impact on the convergence between two models
under consideration. With the increase in the injection pressure, the
discrepancy between the models of compressible and incompressible gas raises
for all the considered injection fluids (CO2, CH4 and N2). Due to a steep slope
of 'density-pressure' curve for CO2 at low initial reservoir pressure, the
incompressible model cannot accurately predict the oil displacement efficiency
by this gas at any reasonable injection pressure. All 1D results are also
representative for 2D simulation. However, the mismatch between two models
increases considerably for 2D simulation scenarios.

on-state performance. This booster has been in production for at least a
decade. Despite this, a systematic study of the impact of strain on off-state
leakage current has been lacking. In this work we use experimental data and
ab-initio calculations to refine existing models to account for the impact of
strain on band-to-band tunnelling and trap-assisted tunnelling in silicon. We
observe that the strain may dramatically increase the leakage current,
depending on the type of tunnelling involved. For band-to-band and
trap-assisted tunnelling, low uniaxial strains of 0.1% (or 180 MPa) can
increase the leakage current by 60% and 10% compared to the unstrained case,
respectively. Using our models, we predict that compressive strain on the order
of 1% (or 2 GPa) can increase the leakage current by 150 times. Conversely,
tensile strain may diminish or at most double the leakage current in all
observed cases. Though detrimental in conventional inversion-mode MOSFETs,
these processes may be used to boost the performance of Tunnel Field Effect
Transistors, where on-state current is defined by band-to-band tunnelling.

people, machines, and processes with which users frequently interact using
computer interfaces and websites. Unlike interfaces to pure machines, we
contend that borg-human interaction (BHI) happens in a context combining the
anthropomorphization of the interface, conflict with users, and dramatization
of the interaction process. We believe this context requires designers to
construct the human facet of the borg, a structure encompassing the borg's
personality, social behavior, and embodied actions; and the strategies to
co-create dramatic narratives with the user. To design the human facet of a
borg, different concepts and models are explored and discussed, borrowing ideas
from psychology, sociology, and arts. Based on those foundations, we propose
six design methodologies to complement traditional computer-human interface
design techniques, including play-and-freeze enactment of conflicts and the use
of giant puppets as interface prototypes.

attempts to solve the time-dependent Wigner equation in the presence of a
general class of unbounded potentials by exploiting two equivalent forms of the
pseudo-differential operator: integral form and series form (i.e., the Moyal
expansion). The unbounded parts at infinities are approximated or modeled by
polynomials and then a remaining localized potential dominates the central
area. The fact that the Moyal expansion reduces to a finite series for
polynomial potentials is fully utilized. Using a spectral collocation
discretization which conserves both mass and energy, several typical quantum
systems are simulated with a high accuracy and reliable estimation of
macroscopically measurable quantities is thus obtained.

precursors of the most massive structures in the Universe began to form shortly
after the Big Bang, in regions corresponding to the largest fluctuations in the
cosmic density field. Observing these structures during their period of active
growth and assembly - the first few hundred million years of the Universe - is
challenging because it requires surveys that are sensitive enough to detect the
distant galaxies that act as signposts for these structures and wide enough to
capture the rarest objects. As a result, very few such objects have been
detected so far. Here we report observations of a far-infrared-luminous object
at redshift 6.900 (less than 800 Myr after the Big Bang) that was discovered in
a wide-field survey. High-resolution imaging reveals this source to be a pair
of extremely massive star-forming galaxies. The larger of these galaxies is
forming stars at a rate of 2900 solar masses per year, contains 270 billion
solar masses of gas and 2.5 billion solar masses of dust, and is more massive
than any other known object at a redshift of more than 6. Its rapid star
formation is probably triggered by its companion galaxy at a projected
separation of just 8 kiloparsecs. This merging companion hosts 35 billion solar
masses of stars and has a star-formation rate of 540 solar masses per year, but
has an order of magnitude less gas and dust than its neighbor and physical
conditions akin to those observed in lower-metallicity galaxies in the nearby
Universe. These objects suggest the presence of a dark-matter halo with a mass
of more than 400 billion solar masses, making it among the rarest dark-matter
haloes that should exist in the Universe at this epoch.

5G networks.With a high number of antennas at the BS, both spectral and energy
efficiencies can be improved. Unfortunately, the downlink channel estimation
overhead scales linearly with the number of antenna. This does not create
complications in Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems since the channel estimate
of the uplink direction can be directly utilized for link adaptation in the
downlink direction. However, this channel reciprocity is unfeasible for the
Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) systems where different physical transmission
channels are existent for the uplink and downlink. In the aim of reducing the
amount of Channel State Information (CSI) feedback for FDD systems, the
promising method of two stage beamforming transmission was introduced. The
performance of this transmission scheme is however highly influenced by the
users grouping and selection mechanisms. In this paper, we first introduce a
new similarity measure coupled with a novel clustering technique to achieve the
appropriate users partitioning. We also use graph theory to develop a low
complexity groups scheduling scheme that outperforms currently existing methods
in both sum-rate and throughput fairness. This performance gain is demonstrated

We show that recurrence determinism distinguishes three main types of
$\omega$-limit sets of zero entropy maps: finite, solenoidal without
non-separable points, and solenoidal with non-separable points. As a corollary
we obtain characterizations of strongly non-chaotic and Li-Yorke (non-)chaotic
interval maps via recurrence determinism. For strongly non-chaotic maps,
recurrence determinism is always equal to one. Li-Yorke non-chaotic interval
maps are those for which recurrence determinism is always positive. Finally,
Li-Yorke chaos implies the existence of a Cantor set of points with zero

of goods on the basis of a potential customer's attributes like location,
financial status, possessions, or behavior. Several cases of online price
differentiation have been revealed in recent years. For example, different
pricing based on a user's location was discovered for online office supply
chain stores and there were indications that offers for hotel rooms are priced
higher for Apple users compared to Windows users at certain online booking
websites. One potential source for relevant distinctive features are
\emph{system fingerprints}, i.\,e., a technique to recognize users' systems by
identifying unique attributes such as the source IP address or system
configuration. In this paper, we shed light on the ecosystem of pricing at
online platforms and aim to detect if and how such platform providers make use
of price differentiation based on digital system fingerprints. We designed and
implemented an automated price scanner capable of disguising itself as an
arbitrary system, leveraging real-world system fingerprints, and searched for
price differences related to different features (e.\,g., user location,
language setting, or operating system). This system allows us to explore price
differentiation cases and expose those characteristic features of a system that
may influence a product's price.

by Matthews (2001) to overcome some of the shortcomings of significance tests.
A significant result is deemed credible if current knowledge about the effect
size is in conflict with any sceptical prior that would make the effect
non-significant. In this paper I formalize the approach and propose to use
Bayesian predictive tail probabilities to quantify the evidence for
credibility. This gives rise to a p-value for extrinsic credibility, taking
into account both the internal and the external evidence for an effect. The
assessment of intrinsic credibility leads to a new threshold for ordinary
significance that is remarkably close to the recently proposed 0.005 level.
Finally, a p-value for intrinsic credibility is proposed that is a simple
function of the ordinary p-value for significance and has a direct frequentist
interpretation in terms of the replication probability that a future study
under identical conditions will give an estimated effect in the same direction
as the first study.

4-6 lower than that of the widespread H2S molecule. H2S and S2H are efficiently
formed on the UV-irradiated icy grain mantles. We performed ice irradiation
experiments to determine the H2S and S2H photodesorption yields. The obtained
values are ~1.2x10$^{-3}$ and <1x10$^{-5}$ molecules per incident photon for
H2S and S2H, respectively. Our upper limit to the S2H photodesorption yield
suggests that photo-desorption is not a competitive mechanism to release the

desorption, cosmic-ray desorption and grain shattering can increase the gaseous
S2H abundance to some extent. Alternatively, S2H can be formed via gas phase
reactions involving gaseous H2S and the abundant ions S+ and SH+. The detection
of S2H in this nebula could be therefore the result of the coexistence of an

uncertainty in the measured line intensities. One of the main sources of
uncertainty is instrumental scattered light, which is potentially most
important in low-brightness areas. In the solar corona, such areas include
polar and equatorial coronal holes, which are the source regions of the solar
wind; instrument-scattered light must thus pose a significant obstacle to
studies of the source regions of the solar wind. In this paper we investigate
the importance of instrument-scattered light on observations of equatorial
coronal holes made by the Hinode/EIS spectrometer in two different phases of
the solar cycle. We find that the instrument-scattered light is significant at
all temperatures, and in both regions it amounts to approximately 10% of the
average intensity of the neighboring quiet Sun regions. Such contribution
dominates the measured intensity for spectral lines formed at temperatures
larger than Log T = 6.15 K, and has deep implications for spectroscopic
diagnostics of equatorial coronal hole plasmas and studies of the source
regions of a large portion of the solar wind which reaches Earth. Our results
suggest that the high temperature tail of in the coronal hole plasma
distribution with temperature, however small, is an artifact due to the
presence of scattered light.

different dose distributions in different fractions, may lower treatment side
effects without compromising tumor control. This is achieved by
hypofractionating parts of the tumor while delivering approximately uniformly
fractionated doses to the healthy tissue. Optimization of such treatments is
based on biologically effective dose (BED), which leads to computationally
challenging nonconvex optimization problems. Current optimization methods yield
only locally optimal plans, and it has been unclear whether these are close to
the global optimum. We present an optimization model to compute rigorous bounds
on the normal tissue BED reduction achievable by such plans.
  The approach is demonstrated on liver tumors, where the primary goal is to
reduce mean liver BED without compromising other treatment objectives. First a
uniformly fractionated reference plan is computed using convex optimization.
Then a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming model is
solved to local optimality to compute a spatiotemporally fractionated plan that
minimizes mean liver BED subject to the constraints that the plan is no worse
than the reference plan with respect to all other planning goals. Finally, we
derive a convex relaxation of the second model in the form of a semidefinite
programming problem, which provides a lower bound on the lowest achievable mean
liver BED.
  The method is presented on 5 cases with distinct geometries. The computed
spatiotemporal plans achieve 12-35% mean liver BED reduction over the reference
plans, which corresponds to 79-97% of the gap between the reference mean liver
BEDs and our lower bounds. This indicates that spatiotemporal treatments can
achieve substantial reduction in normal tissue BED, and that local optimization
provides plans that are close to realizing the maximum potential benefit.

compelling evidence of nodal-line fermions in centrosymmetric semimetal TiB$_2$

the BZ center in the vertical mirror plane $\sigma_v$. The linear dispersions
forming Dirac nodal rings are as wide as 2 eV. We further observe that the two
groups of nodal rings link together along the $\Gamma$-$K$ direction, composing
a nodal-link configuration. The simple electronic structure with Dirac nodal

years, they have been criticized for their weaknesses in representing and in
processing complex structured knowledge which is crucial for combinatoric

can encode structured relational knowledge in neural activation, and store
bounded First Order Logic constraints in connection weights. Both architectures
learn to search for a solution that satisfies the constraints. Learning is done
by unsupervised practicing on problem instances from the same domain, in a way
that improves the network-solving speed. No teacher exists to provide answers
for the problem instances of the training and test sets. However, the domain
constraints are provided as prior knowledge to a loss function that measures
the degree of constraint violations. Iterations of activation calculation and
learning are executed until a solution that maximally satisfies the constraints
emerges on the output units. As a test case, block-world planning problems are

(FEM) for real-time surgical simulation. Users only need to provide a
background mesh which is not necessarily conforming to the
boundaries/interfaces of the simulated object. The details of the surface,
which can be directly obtained from binary images, are taken into account by a
multilevel embedding algorithm applied to elements of the background mesh that
cut by the surface. Boundary conditions can be implicitly imposed on the
surface using Lagrange multipliers. The implementation is verified by
convergence studies with optimal rates. The algorithm is applied to various
needle insertion simulations (e.g. for biopsy or brachytherapy) into brain and
liver to verify the reliability of method, and numerical results show that the
present method can make the discretisation independent from geometric
description, and can avoid the complexity of mesh generation of complex
geometries while retaining the accuracy of the standard FEM. Using the proposed
approach is very suitable for real-time and patient specific simulations as it
improves the simulation accuracy by taking into account automatically and
properly the simulated geometry.

(compressible) aggregation function of the input measurements. What rate of
computation can be maintained, by properly choosing the aggregation tree, the
TDMA schedule of the tree edges, and the transmission powers? This can be
viewed as the convergecast capacity of a wireless network. We show here that
the optimal rate is effectively a constant. This holds even in \emph{arbitrary}
networks, under the physical model of interference. This compares with previous
bounds that are logarithmic (e.g., $\Omega(1/\log n)$). Namely, we show that a
rate of $\Omega(1/\log^* \Delta)$ is possible, where $\Delta$ is the length
diversity (ratio between the furthest to the shortest distance between nodes).
It also implies that the \emph{scheduling complexity} of wireless connectivity
is $O(\log^* \Delta)$. This is achieved using the natural minimum spanning tree
(MST). Our method crucially depends on choosing the appropriate power
assignment for the instance at hand, since without power control, only a
trivial linear rate can be guaranteed. We also show that there is a fixed power
assignment that allows for a rate of $\Omega(1/\log\log \Delta)$. Surprisingly,
these bounds are best possible. No aggregation network can guarantee a rate
better than $O(1/\log\log \Delta)$ using fixed power assignment. Also, when
using arbitrary power control, there are instances whose MSTs cannot be
scheduled in fewer than $\Omega(1/\log^* \Delta)$ slots.

antiferromagnet (AFM) states, which are inert relative to a uniform magnetic
field, due to the vanishingly-small net magnetization. The question is, how
does an AFM response to an inhomogeneous field? Here we address the problem
through a complete classification of the magnetic forces on an AFM domain wall
(DW), revealing the following physical properties: (i) the tiny net
magnetization still responses to the field gradient. (ii) the N\'{e}el order is
sensitive to the field difference between two sublattices. (iii) DW energy has
a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field due to its noncollinear structure.
Remarkably, the first two factors drive DW to the opposite directions in a
nanowire, but the third effect tends to push the DW to the high field region.
Consequently, the competition among these three forces can be applied to
understand the seemingly-contradictory results on AFM motion in literature.
Additionally, our results provide a new route for a speedy manipulating AFM DW;
our numerical simulation indicated that for a synthetic antiferromagnet, the DW
propagating speed can reach tens of kilometers per second, an order of
magnitude higher than that driven by an electric current.

to be as spacetime- and coordinate- independent as possible. The emission,

difficult because the disease spread is typically only partially observed e.g.
in form of reported incidences in given time periods. This chapter discusses
how to perform likelihood-based inference for partially observed Markov
epidemic models when it is relatively easy to generate samples from the Markov
transmission model while the likelihood function is intractable. The first part
of the chapter reviews the theoretical background of inference for partially
observed Markov processes (POMP) via iterated filtering. In the second part of
the chapter the performance of the method and associated practical difficulties
are illustrated on two examples. In the first example a simulated outbreak data
set consisting of the number of newly reported cases aggregated by week is
fitted to a POMP where the underlying disease transmission model is assumed to
be a simple Markovian SIR model. The second example illustrates possible model
extensions such as seasonal forcing and over-dispersion in both, the
transmission and observation model, which can be used, e.g., when analysing
routinely collected rotavirus surveillance data. Both examples are implemented
using the R-package pomp (King et al., 2016) and the code is made available

Control (MAC) in wireless networks due to its simplicity and distributed

foundation of new CSMA based MAC schemes where links are allowed to transition
into sleep mode to reduce the power consumption. However, throughput optimality
of these schemes was not established. This paper therefore aims to find a new
CSMA scheme that combines both throughput optimality and energy efficiency by
adapting to the throughput and power consumption needs of each link. This is
done by controlling operational parameters such as back-off and sleeping timers
with the aim of optimizing a certain objective function. The resulting CSMA
scheme is characterized by being asynchronous, completely distributed and being
able to adapt to different power consumption profiles required by each link
while still ensuring throughput optimality. The performance gain in terms of
energy efficiency compared to the conventional adaptive CSMA scheme is
demonstrated through computer simulations.

on the torus it can be be identified with the Ricci flow). This leads to
algorithmic approximations of the potential of the Optimal Transport map, as
well as the Optimal Transport distance, with explicit bounds on the arithmetic
complexity of the construction and the approximation errors. As applications we
obtain explicit schemes of nearly linear complexity, at each iteration, for
optimal transport on the torus and the two-sphere, as well as the far-field
antenna problem. Connections to Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are exploited.

measurements on equilibrium systems diverges exponentially fast as their

showcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small
non-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean
that a part may contain more information about the global temperature than the
whole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove
that local quantum thermometry at low $T$ is exponentially inefficient in
non-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we
show through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a
harmonic thermometer (probe) jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by
means of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like
behavior as $T \rightarrow 0$. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the
fact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature
measurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped
translationally invariant chain (for which low--$T$ thermometry is indeed
exponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the
low-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a
gapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample
interaction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In
this way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in
typical dissipative models stems from the fact that these are gapless and, as
such, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped
counterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the
ultimate limitations of low--$T$ thermometry, is thus whether or not their
energy spectrum is gapped.

time-resolved observations of node dynamics are gaining relevance across

and incomplete trajectories. Ideal reconstruction in such scenario requires and
exhaustive approach of simulating the dynamics for all possible network
configurations and matching the simulated against the actual trajectories,
which of course is computationally too costly for any realistic application.
Relying on insights from equation discovery and machine learning, we here
introduce \textit{decoupling approximation} of dynamical networks and propose a

matching the simulated against the actual trajectories for each node
individually rather than for the entire network at once. Despite drastic
reduction of the computational cost that this approximation entails, we find
our method's performance to be very close to that of the ideal method. In
particular, we not only make no assumptions about properties of the

largely independent of the dynamical regime at hand. Of crucial relevance for
practical applications, we also find our method to be extremely robust to both
length and resolution of the trajectories and relatively insensitive to noise.

polynomially with the number of particles have been developed over the past
fifteen years to tackle closed-shell mid-mass nuclei. Open-shell nuclei have
been further addressed by implementing variants based on the concept of
spontaneous symmetry breaking (and restoration).
  Purpose: In order to access the spectroscopy of open-shell nuclei more
systematically while controlling the numerical cost, we design a novel
many-body method that combines the merit of breaking and restoring symmetries
with those brought about by low-rank individual excitations.
  Methods: The recently proposed truncated configuration-interaction method
based on optimized symmetry-broken and -restored states is extended to the
z-signature symmetry associated with a discrete subgroup of SU(2). The
highly-truncated N-body Hilbert subspace within which the Hamiltonian is
diagonalized is spanned by a z-signature broken and restored Slater determinant
vacuum and associated low-rank excitations.
  Results: The proposed method provides an excellent reproduction of the
ground-state energy and of low-lying excitation energies of various
z-signatures and total angular momenta. In doing so, the successive benefits of
(i) breaking the symmetry, (ii) restoring the symmetry, (iii) including
low-rank particle-hole excitations and (iv) optimizing the amount by which the
underlying vacuum breaks the symmetry are illustrated.
  Conclusions: The numerical cost of the newly designed variational method is
polynomial with respect to the system size. The present study confirms the
results obtained previously for the attractive pairing Hamiltonian in
connection with the breaking and restoration of U(1) global gauge symmetry.
These two studies constitute a strong motivation to apply this method to
realistic nuclear Hamiltonians.

symmetry in its dependent variables. In conjunction with other admitted
symmetries of linear type, the associated invariant solution condition poses a
linear eigenvalue problem. If this problem is structured such that the spectral
theorem applies, then the general solution of the considered linear PDE system
is obtained by summing or integrating the invariant eigenfunctions (modes) over
all eigenvalues, depending on whether the spectrum of the operator is discrete
or continuous. By first studying the 1-D diffusion equation as a demonstrating
example, this method is then applied to a relevant 2-D problem from
hydrodynamic stability analysis. The aim of this study is to draw attention to
the following two independent facts that need to be addressed in future studies
when constructing solutions for linear PDEs with the method of Lie-symmetries:
(i) Although each new symmetry leads to a mathematically different spectral
decomposition, they may all be physically redundant to standard ones and do not
reveal a new physical mechanism behind the overall considered dynamical
process, as incorrectly asserted, for example, in the recent studies by the
group of Oberlack et al. Hence, with regard to linear stability analysis, no
physically ""new"" or more ""general"" modes are generated by this method than the
ones already established. (ii) Next to the eigenvalue parameters, each single
mode can also acquire non-system parameters, depending on the choice of its
underlying symmetry. These symmetry-induced parameters, however, are all
physically irrelevant, since their effect on a single mode will cancel when
considering all modes collectively. In particular, the collective action of all
single modes is identical for all symmetry-based decompositions and thus
indistinguishable when considering the full physical fields.

there has been a huge theoretical and observational effort into improving our
understanding of the Universe. The cosmological equations describing the
dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe are systems of ordinary
differential equations, and one of the most elegant ways these can be
investigated is by casting them into the form of dynamical systems. This allows
the use of powerful analytical and numerical methods to gain a quantitative
understanding of the cosmological dynamics derived by the models under study.
In this review we apply these techniques to cosmology. We begin with a brief
introduction to dynamical systems, fixed points, linear stability theory,
Lyapunov stability, centre manifold theory and more advanced topics relating to
the global structure of the solutions. Using this machinery we then analyse a
large number of cosmological models and show how the stability conditions allow
them to be tightly constrained and even ruled out on purely theoretical
grounds. We are also able to identify those models which deserve further in

compute-intensive, parallelizable applications. However, programming these
devices is a difficult task. Writing efficient device code is challenging, and
is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are
rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language
ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently
add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming
language.
  We evaluate our approach by adding support for NVIDIA GPUs to the Julia
programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we
significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and
facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level
Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for GPU
programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining
application performance similar to that of the official NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.

universe need not have made self-reference possible. It did, and the question
then is how. In the second half of this essay, I show how a basic move in
physics, known as renormalization, transforms the ""forgetful"" second-order
equations of fundamental physics into a rich, self-referential world that makes
possible the major transitions we care so much about. While the universe runs

applications, having data of each subject randomly assigned to both training
and test sets (record-wise data split) can lead to massive underestimation of
the cross-validation prediction error, due to the presence of ""subject identity
confounding"" caused by the classifier's ability to identify subjects, instead
of recognizing disease. To solve this problem, the authors recommended the
random assignment of the data of each subject to either the training or the
test set (subject-wise data split). The adoption of subject-wise split has been
criticized in Little et al (2017), on the basis that it can violate assumptions
required by cross-validation to consistently estimate generalization error. In
particular, adopting subject-wise splitting in heterogeneous data-sets might
lead to model under-fitting and larger classification errors. Hence, Little et
al argue that perhaps the overestimation of prediction errors with subject-wise
cross-validation, rather than underestimation with record-wise
cross-validation, is the reason for the discrepancies between prediction error
estimates generated by the two splitting strategies. In order to shed light on
this controversy, we focus on simpler classification performance metrics and
develop permutation tests that can detect identity confounding. By focusing on
permutation tests, we are able to evaluate the merits of record-wise and
subject-wise data splits under more general statistical dependencies and
distributional structures of the data, including situations where
cross-validation breaks down. We illustrate the application of our tests using
synthetic and real data from a Parkinson's disease study.

with an alternating potential is applied to the electrode and the response of
the plasma is measured. Its dynamical interaction with the plasma in
electrostatic, kinetic description can be modeled in an abstract notation based
on functional analytic methods. These methods provide the opportunity to derive
a general solution, which is given as the response function of the probe-plasma
system. It is defined by the matrix elements of the resolvent of an appropriate
dynamical operator. Based on the general solution a residual damping for
vanishing pressure can be predicted and can only be explained by kinetic
effects. Within this manuscript an explicit response function of the spherical
impedance probe is derived. Therefore, the resolvent is determined by its
algebraic representation based on an expansion in orthogonal basis functions.
This allows to compute an approximated response function and its corresponding
spectra. These spectra show additional damping due to kinetic effects and are
in good agreement with former kinetically determined spectra.

fit a single power-law with an index of $\delta = 1.39 \pm 0.618$ and amplitude

quasar feedback intermittently shuts down the accretion of gas onto the central

distribution at the surface of nearby stars, in particular the so-called
gravity darkening that makes fast rotating stars brighter at their poles than
at their equator. However, good models of gravity darkening are missing for
stars that posses a convective envelope. In order to better understand how
rotation affects the heat transfer in stellar convective envelopes, we focus on
the heat flux distribution in latitude at the outer surface of numerical
models. We carry out a systematic parameter study of three-dimensional, direct
numerical simulations of anelastic convection in rotating spherical shells.
Restricting our investigations to hydrodynamical models with a thermal Prandtl
number fixed to unity, we consider both thick and thin (solar-like) shells, and
vary the stratification over three orders of magnitude. We measure the heat
transfer efficiency in terms of the Nusselt number, defined as the output
luminosity normalised by the conductive state luminosity. We report diverse
Nusselt number profiles in latitude, ranging from brighter (usually at the
onset of convection) to darker equator and uniform profiles. We find that the
variations of the surface brightness are mainly controlled by the surface value
of the local Rossby number: when the Coriolis force dominates the dynamics, the
heat flux is weakened in the equatorial region by the zonal wind and enhanced
at the poles by convective motions inside the tangent cylinder. In the presence
of a strong background density stratification however, as expected in real
stars, the increase of the local Rossby number in the outer layers leads to
uniformisation of the surface heat flux distribution.

exploration-exploitation dilemma. It is concerned with maximising the total
rewards for a gambler by sequentially pulling an arm from a multi-armed slot
machine where each arm is associated with a reward distribution. In static
MABs, the reward distributions do not change over time, while in dynamic MABs,
each arm's reward distribution can change, and the optimal arm can switch over
time. Motivated by many real applications where rewards are binary, we focus on
dynamic Bernoulli bandits. Standard methods like $\epsilon$-Greedy and Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB), which rely on the sample mean estimator, often fail to
track changes in the underlying reward for dynamic problems. In this paper, we
overcome the shortcoming of slow response to change by deploying adaptive
estimation in the standard methods and propose a new family of algorithms,
which are adaptive versions of $\epsilon$-Greedy, UCB, and Thompson sampling.
These new methods are simple and easy to implement. Moreover, they do not
require any prior knowledge about the dynamic reward process, which is
important for real applications. We examine the new algorithms numerically in
different scenarios and the results show solid improvements of our algorithms

that the numerical scheme is always well-defined as long as the numerical

window to the physics of the very early universe. Beyond the nearly

raises the question of what one can learn from a future observation of the

non-perturbative quasi-stable objects like oscillons can act as strong sources

semi-analytical techniques. In particular, we discuss how the GW spectrum is

the background cosmology, the asymmetry of the oscillons and the evolution of
the number density of the oscillons. We compare our semi-analytic results with

not limited by the data dimensions, and is applicable to situations where $p >>
n$. For several statistics we obtain asymptotic $p$-values under relatively
mild conditions. For the two-sample special case, we show that the proposed
statistics are permutationally equivalent or similar to existing proposed

scatterings of lithium (Li) isotopes ($A =$ 6--9) for the $^{12}$C and
$^{28}$Si targets at $E/A =$ 50--60 MeV. The wave functions of the Li isotopes
were obtained using the stochastic multi-configuration mixing (SMCM) method
based on the microscopic-cluster model. The proton radii of the $^{7}$Li,
$^{8}$Li, and $^{9}$Li nuclei became smaller as the number of valence neutrons
increased. The valence neutrons in the $^{8}$Li and $^{9}$Li nuclei exhibited a
glue-like behavior, thereby attracting the $\alpha$ and $t$ clusters. Based on
the transition densities derived from these microscopic wave functions, the
elastic-scattering cross section was calculated using a microscopic
coupled-channel (MCC) method with a complex $G$-matrix interaction. The
existing experimental data for the elastic scatterings of the Li isotopes and
$^{10}$Be nuclei were well reproduced. The Li isotope elastic cross sections
were demonstrated for the $^{12}$C and $^{28}$Si targets at $E/A$ =53 MeV. The
glue-like effect of the valence neutrons on the Li isotope was clearly
demonstrated by the CC effect on elastic scattering. Finally, we realize that
the valence neutrons stabilized the bindings of the core parts and the CC
effect related to core excitation was indeed reduced.

data mining, or computer vision can be formulated as optimization problems
which consist in minimizing a sum of convex functions, not necessarily
differentiable, possibly composed with linear operators and that in turn can be
transformed to split feasibility problems (SFP), see for example \cite{ce94}.
Each function is typically either a data fidelity term or a regularization term
enforcing some properties on the solution, see for example \cite{cpp09} and
references therein. In this paper we are interested in Split Feasibility
Problems which can be seen as a general form of $Q$-Lasso introduced in
\cite{aasnx13} that extended the well-known Lasso of Tibshirani
\cite{Tibshirani96}. $Q$ is a closed convex subset of a Euclidean $m$-space,
for some integer $m\geq1$, that can be interpreted as the set of errors within
given tolerance level when linear measurements are taken to recover a
signal/image via the Lasso.
  Inspired by recent works by Lou et al \cite{ly, xcxz12}, we are interested in
a nonconvex regularization of SFP and propose three split algorithms for
solving this general case. The first one is based on the DC (difference of
convex) algorithm (DCA) introduced by Pham Dinh Tao, the second one in nothing
else than the celebrate forward-backward algorithm and the third one uses a
method introduced by Mine and Fukushima. It is worth mentioning that the SFP
model a number of applied problems arising from signal/image processing and
specially optimization problems for intensity-modulated radiation therapy

chemical bonds in C-C, F-C and F-F bonds, the finite-size quantum confinement,

properties and magnetic configurations. By the detailed analyses, the critical
orbital hybridizations in determining the essential properties are accurately
identified from the atom-dominated energy bands, the spatial charge
distributions, and the orbital-projected density of states. The top-site F-C
bonds, with the multi-orbital hybridizations, create the non-uniform buckled
honeycomb lattice. There exist the C-, F- and (C, F)-dominated energy bands.
Fluorinated graphene belongs either to the p-type metals (with/without the
ferromagnetic spin arrangement) or to the large-gap semiconductors (without
magnetism), depending on the concentration and distribution of adatoms.
Specially, fluorinated graphene nanoribbons, with armchair/zigzag edge,
presents five kinds of spin-dependent properties, covering the non-magnetic and
ferromagnetic metals, non-magnetic semiconductors, and anti-ferromagnetic
semiconductors with/without the spin splitting. The various band-edge states in
2D and 1D systems appear as the rich and unique structures in density of
states. Part of theoretical predictions are consistent with the experimental
measurements, and the others are worthy of the further examinations. Also, the

and space-time-varying blurs. To suppress these effects, we propose a
multi-frame reconstruction scheme to recover a latent image from the observed
image sequence. Recent approaches are commonly based on registering each frame
to a reference image, by which geometric turbulent deformations can be
estimated and a sharp image can be restored. A major challenge is that a fine
reference image is usually unavailable, as every turbulence-degraded frame is
distorted. A high-quality reference image is crucial for the accurate
estimation of geometric deformations and fusion of frames. Besides, it is
unlikely that all frames from the image sequence are useful, and thus frame
selection is necessary and highly beneficial. In this work, we propose a
variational model for joint subsampling of frames and extraction of a clear
image. A fine image and a suitable choice of subsample are simultaneously
obtained by iteratively reducing an energy functional. The energy consists of a
fidelity term measuring the discrepancy between the extracted image and the
subsampled frames, as well as regularization terms on the extracted image and
the subsample. Different choices of fidelity and regularization terms are
explored. By carefully selecting suitable frames and extracting the image, the
quality of the reconstructed image can be significantly improved. Extensive
experiments have been carried out, which demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed model. In addition, the extracted subsamples and images can be put in
existing algorithms to produce improved results.

prediction, and the importance of urban indicators is ranked and clustered in
groups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data

is compared to 2D-fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) analysis of the same data and
shown to give superior quantitative results with comparatively fewer
computational steps and corrections. Further analysis is presented
demonstrating and examining a method for preserving the complex information
inherent within the eddy-current scan data during Radon-transform analysis.
This investigation shows that the real and imaginary components of the ECT data
encode information about the sacking sequence allowing the distinction between
composites with different stacking structures. This new analysis technique
could be used for in-process analysis of CFRP structures as a more accurate
characterisation method, reducing the chance of costly manufacturing errors.

magnetization in magnetic memory devices. However, deterministically switching
perpendicular memory bits usually requires the application of an additional
bias field for breaking lateral symmetry. Here we present a new approach of
field-free deterministic perpendicular switching using a strain-mediated SOT
switching method. The strain-induced magnetoelastic anisotropy breaks the
lateral symmetry, and the resulting symmetry-breaking is controllable. A finite
element model and a macrospin model are used to numerically simulate the
strain-mediated SOT switching mechanism. The results show that a relatively
small voltage (${\pm}0.5$ V) along with a modest current ($3.5 \times 10^{7}
A/cm^{2}$) can produce a 180{\deg} perpendicular magnetization reversal. The
switching direction (up or down) is dictated by the voltage polarity (positive
or negative) applied to the piezoelectric layer in the magnetoelastic/heavy
metal/piezoelectric heterostructure. The switching speed can be as fast as 10
GHz. More importantly, this control mechanism can be potentially implemented in
a magnetic random-access memory system with small footprint, high endurance and
high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) readout ratio.
