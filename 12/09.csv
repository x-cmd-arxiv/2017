analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass
energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$,
and collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. Two decay modes of the
Z boson are investigated. In the leptonic channels, the Z boson candidates are
reconstructed using electron or muon pairs. In the hadronic channels, they are
identified using a large-radius jet, containing either light-quark or b quark
decay products of the Z boson, via jet substructure and advanced b quark
tagging techniques. The results from these channels are combined and
interpreted in terms of upper limits on the product of the production cross
section and the branching fraction to Z$\gamma$ for narrow and broad spin-0
resonances with masses between 0.35 and 4.0 TeV, providing thereby the most
stringent limits on such resonances.

approach. The analysis takes into consideration the special relations between
the $Z'$ couplings to the Standard model fields proper to the renormalizable
theories. The constraints on the $Z'$ couplings to the Standard model fermions
corresponding to the narrow width approximation are derived. The results are
compared with the benchmark $Z'$ models, such as $Z'_{\chi }$ and $LR$. It is
shown that the current experimental limits on the Standard model $Z$ width
impose no limits on the $Z'$ width, so that the ratio $\Gamma _{Z'} / m_{Z'}$
is allowed to be up to 100%. This fact is connected with the smallness of the
$Z-Z'$ mixing. So, the finite-width $Z'$ is admitted and cannot be excluded
from consideration. Also, the new constraints on the $Z-Z'$ mixing angle are
derived which agree with the corresponding earlier results of the LEP data
analysis.

types of defect curves were investigated. We start with a simple task of
globule formation from four-defect line. It was proved that an exothermic
reaction of collapse occurs and the dependence of energy release on temperature
was observed. Critical Casimir energy of extensive line of constant curvature
was also examined. It was shown that its critical Casimir energy is
proportional to curvature that leads to the tendency to radius decreasing under
Casimir forces. The results obtained can be applied to proteins folding problem

of barriers to growth must be overcome. One such barrier, relevant for compact
grains in the inner regions of the disc, is the `bouncing barrier' in which
large grains ($\sim$ mm size) tend to bounce off each other rather than
sticking. However, by maintaining a population of small grains it has been
suggested that cm-size particles may grow rapidly by sweeping up these small
grains. We present the first numerically resolved investigation into the
conditions under which grains may be lucky enough to grow beyond the bouncing
barrier by a series of rare collisions leading to growth (so-called
`breakthrough'). Our models support previous results, and show that in simple
models breakthrough requires the mass ratio at which high velocity collisions
transition to growth instead of causing fragmentation to be low, $\phi \lesssim
50$. However, in models that take into account the dependence of the
fragmentation threshold on mass-ratio, we find breakthrough occurs more
readily, even if mass transfer is relatively inefficient. This suggests that
bouncing may only slow down growth, rather than preventing growth beyond a
threshold barrier. However, even when growth beyond the bouncing barrier is
possible, radial drift will usually prevent growth to arbitrarily large sizes.

consistent results in the sub-GeV/n energy window, which is where dark matter

the study of the small scale clustering of DM, and are compatible with current
cosmological observations. Here we derive the $J$-factor of 20 dwarf spheroidal

self-interactions. $J$-factors are derived through a profile Likelihood
approach, assuming either NFW or cored DM profiles. We also compare our results

differences between the liquids and for various viscosities, revealing a
power-law $L(t)\sim t^{\alpha}$ with a spreading exponent $\alpha \approx
0.75$. This value is consistent with previous results for viscosity-limited
spreading over a deep bath. A single power law of rescaled distance as a
function of rescaled time reasonably captures our experiments, as well as
different geometries, miscibilities, and surface tension modifiers (solvents
and surfactants). This result enables engineering the spreading dynamics of a
wide range of liquid-liquid systems.

to determine an unknown ground energy faster than with phase estimation if a

comparing the estimated binary fraction of all PNe central stars (CS) to that

from our sample and identify true CS. Within our final sample of 7 CS, 6 had
previously either not been identified or confirmed. We detected an $i$ band
excess indicative of a low-mass companion star in 3 CS, including one known
binary, leading us to to conclude that VPHAS+ provides the precise photometry
required for the IR excess method presented here, and will likely improve as
the survey completes and the calibration process finalised. Given the promising
results from this trial sample, the entire VPHAS+ catalogue should be used to
study PNe and extend the IR excess-tested CS sample.

We describe the single particle wavefunctions as a Linear Combination of Dopant
Orbitals (LCDO). The electronic states are calculated within configuration
interaction (CI). Due to the peculiar oscillatory behavior of each basis
orbital, properties of these chains are strongly affected by the interdonor
distance $R_0$, in a non-monotonic way. Ground state (T=0K) properties such as
charge and spin correlations are shown to remain robust under temperatures up
to 4K for specific values of $R_0$. The robustness of the model against
disorder is also tested, allowing some fluctuation of the placement site around
the target position. We suggest that finite donor chains in Si may serve as an
analog simulator for strongly correlated model Hamiltonians. This simulator is,
in many ways, complementary to those based on cold atoms in optical
lattices---the trade-off between the tunability achievable in the latter and
the survival of correlation at higher operation temperatures for the former
suggests that both technologies are applicable for different regimes.

presented in this paper to suggest that the flare-up was in all likelihood a
product of an event of nuclear fragmentation that gave birth to a companion
nucleus, which was first detected more than nine weeks later, on June 11, and
remained under observation for 19 days. The companion is found to have
separated from the parent nucleus with a velocity of less than 1 m/s;
subsequently it was subjected to a nongravitational deceleration of 14 units of
10^{-5} the Sun's gravitational acceleration. The companion's overall
dimensions can from this value be estimated al less than one hundred meters
across. Unlike the primary nucleus, the companion displayed considerable
fluctuations in brightness on time scales spanning at least three orders of
magnitude, from a fraction of one hour to weeks. The long temporal gap between
the companion's birth and first detection appears to be a corollary of the
brightness variability. Evidence from the light curve suggests that the
companion became detectable only because of large amounts of debris that it
started shedding as well as increased activity from area newly exposed by
progressive fragmentation, the same process that also resulted in the
companion's impending disintegration by the end of June of in early July.

SMBHs in the field of view. In deep Lynx exposures, the number of observed
objects is expected to become statistically significant. We demonstrate the
capability to limit the phase space of plausible scenarios of the birth and

$K_r^{(k)}$-saturated hypergraphs, the interesting ones are the primitive ones
that do not have a dominating vertex---a vertex belonging to all possible

hypergraph $H$ is uniquely $\tau$-critical if for every edge $e$,
$\tau(H-e)=\tau(H)-1$ and $H-e$ has a unique transversal of size $\tau(H)-1$.
  We have two constructions for primitive uniquely $K_r^{(k)}$-saturated

exists such a hypergraph for every $n>r$. This is in contrast to the case $k=2$
and $r=3$ where only the Moore graphs of diameter two have this property. Our
other construction keeps $n-r$ fixed; in this case we show that for any fixed
$k\ge 2$ there can only be finitely many examples. We give a range for $n$
where these hypergraphs exist. For $n-r=1$ the range is completely determined:
$k+1\le n \le {(k+2)^2\over 4}$. For larger values of $n-r$ the upper end of
our range reaches approximately half of its upper bound. The lower end depends

scheduling for performance and/or energy is yet to be solved for heterogeneous
platforms. The work presented herein mathematically formulates the optimal
heterogeneous system task scheduling as an optimization problem using queueing
theory. We analytically solve for the common case of two processor types, e.g.,
CPU+GPU, and give an optimal policy (CAB). We design the GrIn heuristic to
efficiently solve for near-optimal policy for any number of processor types

through the exclusive 1H(e,e'p)omega reaction using the missing mass
reconstruction technique. The extracted cross sections are separated into the
transverse (T), longitudinal (L), and LT, TT interference terms. The analyzed
data were part of experiment E01-004 (Fpi-2), which used 2.6-5.2GeV electron
beams and HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C. The primary objective
was to detect coincidence pion in the forward-angle, where the backward-angle
omega events were fortuitously detected. The experiment has central Q2 values
of 1.60 and 2.45GeV2, at W=2.21GeV. There was significant coverage in phi and
epsilon, which allowed separation of sigma_T,L,LT,TT. The data set has a unique
u coverage of -u~0, which corresponds to -t>4GeV2.
  The separated sigma_T result suggest a flat ~1/Q^(1.33+/-1.21) dependence,
whereas sigma_L seems to hold a stronger 1/Q^(9.43+/-6.28) dependence. The
sigma_L/sigma_T ratio indicate sigma_T dominance at Q2=2.45 GeV2 at the ~90%
confidence level. After translating the results into the -t space of the
published CLAS data, our data show evidence of a backward-angle omega
electroproduction peak at both Q2 settings. Previously, this phenomenon showing
both forward and backward-angle peaks was only observed in the meson
photoproduction data. Through comparison of our sigma_T data with the
prediction of the Transition Distribution Amplitude (TDA) model, and signs of
sigma_T dominance, promising indications of the applicability of the TDA
factorization are demonstrated at a much lower Q2 value than its preferred
range of Q2>10GeV2. These studies have opened a new means to study the
transition of the nucleon wavefunction through backward-angle experimental
observables.

be realizations of unconventional topological superconductors.
Superconductivity with T$_c$ ~ 3 K in Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ arises upon
intercalation of Sr into the layered topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Here
we elucidate the anisotropy of the normal and superconducting state of
Sr$_{0.1}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with angular dependent magnetotransport and
thermodynamic measurements. High resolution x-ray diffraction studies underline
the high crystalline quality of the samples. We demonstrate that the normal
state electronic and magnetic properties of Sr$_{0.1}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ are
isotropic in the basal plane while we observe a large two-fold in-plane
anisotropy of the upper critical field in the superconducting state. Our
results support the recently proposed odd-parity nematic state characterized by
a nodal gap of $E_u$ symmetry in Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$.

the transit is grazing, making Qatar-6b one of the few exoplanets known in a

the best opportunity to look for additional bodies in the host planetary system

thresholding classifier (BTC), for classification applications (such as face
identification, hyper-spectral image classification, etc.) which is capable of
identifying test samples extremely rapidly and performing high classification
accuracy. Originally BTC is a linear classifier which works based on the
assumption that the samples of the classes of a given dataset are linearly
separable. However, in practice those samples may not be linearly separable. In
this context, we also propose another algorithm namely kernel basic
thresholding classifier (KBTC) which is a non-linear kernel version of the BTC
algorithm. KBTC can achieve promising results especially when the given samples
are linearly non-separable. For both proposals, we introduce sufficient
identification conditions (SICs) under which BTC and KBTC can identify any test
sample in the range space of a given dictionary. By using SICs, we develop
parameter estimation procedures which do not require any cross validation. Both
BTC and KBTC algorithms provide efficient classifier fusion schemes in which
individual classifier outputs are combined to produce better classification
results. For instance, for the application of face identification, this is done
by combining the residuals having different random projectors. For spatial
applications such as hyper-spectral image classification, the fusion is carried
out by incorporating the spatial information, in which the output residual maps
are filtered using a smoothing filter. Numerical results on publicly available
face and hyper-spectral datasets show that our proposal outperforms well-known
support vector machines (SVM)-based techniques, multinomial logistic regression
(MLR)-based methods, and sparsity-based approaches like $l_1$-minimization and
simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP).

  We also give a quantitative description of the above characterization of the
strong convergence in terms of the appropriate metrics on the sets of quantum

continuity of the complementary operation with respect to the strong
convergence is established.
  We show discontinuity of the unitary dilation by constructing a strongly
converging sequence of channels which can not be represented as a reduction of
a strongly converging sequence of unitary channels.
  The Stinespring representation of strongly converging sequences of quantum

as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble). Some corollaries of this
property are considered.

the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons being hotter than
the electrons. In this work, the second of a series, we investigate by means of
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations the efficiency of electron
irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number shocks. We consider
values of plasma beta (ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures) in the range
$4\lesssim \beta_{p0}\lesssim 32$ and sonic Mach number (ratio of shock speed
to pre-shock sound speed) in the range $2\lesssim M_{s}\lesssim 5$, as
appropriate for galaxy cluster shocks. As shown in Paper I, magnetic field
amplification - induced by shock compression of the pre-shock field, or by
strong proton cyclotron and mirror modes accompanying the relaxation of proton
temperature anisotropy - can drive the electron temperature anisotropy beyond
the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of whistler
waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for efficient
entropy production. We find that the post-shock electron temperature $T_{e2}$
exceeds the adiabatic expectation $T_{e2,\rm ad}$ by an amount
$(T_{e2}-T_{e2,\rm ad})/T_{e0}\simeq 0.044 \,M_s (M_s-1)$ (here, $T_{e0}$ is
the pre-shock temperature), which depends only weakly on the plasma beta, over
the range $4\lesssim \beta_{p0}\lesssim 32$ which we have explored, and on the
proton-to-electron mass ratio (the coefficient of $\simeq 0.044$ is measured
for our fiducial $m_i/m_e=49$, and we estimate that it will decrease to $\simeq

GW170817: the nature of the compact remnant and the interstellar shock. The
mass of the remnant of GW170817, $\sim$2.7 $M_\odot$, implies the remnant could
be either a massive, rotating, neutron star, or a black hole. We report Chandra
Director's Discretionary Time observations made in 2017 December and 2018
January, and we reanalyze earlier observations from 2017 August and 2017
September, in order to address these unresolved issues. We estimate the X-ray
flux from a neutron star remnant and compare that to the measured X-ray flux.
If we assume that the spin-down luminosity of any putative neutron star is
converted to pulsar wind nebula X-ray emission in the 0.5-8 keV band with an
efficiency of $10^{-3}$, for a dipole magnetic field with $3 \times 10^{11}$ G

efficiency, however, if the remnant is a rapidly-rotating, magnetized, neutron
star, the total energy in the external shock should rise by a factor
$\sim$$10^2$ (to $\sim$$10^{52}$ erg) after a few years, therefore, Chandra
observations over the next year or two that do not show substantial brightening
will rule out such a remnant. The same observations can distinguish between two
different models for the relativistic outflow, either an angular or radially

$\alpha$-enhanced, with [Fe/H]$=-0.405_{-0.033}^{+0.032}$ and
[$\alpha$/Fe]$=0.145 \pm 0.053$; these abundances are unusual, but not
extraordinary, for a young star with thin-disk kinematics like KELT-21.

contrast of $\Delta K_S=6.39 \pm 0.06$ with respect to the primary. Although
these companions are most likely physically associated with KELT-21, we cannot

follow a cusp profile $\rho(r)\propto r^{-\alpha}$ with characteristic slope
$\alpha=7/4$. This follows from energy conservation and a scattering rate as
given by two body encounters. However, we show that injection of stars close to
the black hole, i.e. a source term in the standard cusp picture, modifies this

with typical slope $\alpha=9/4$ in which stars diffuse outward. Binary
disruption by the intense tidal field of the massive black hole is among the
phenomena that take place in the Galactic Center. In such disruption, one of
the binary members remains bound to the black hole, thus providing a source
term of stars close to the black hole. Assuming a binary fraction of $0.1$ and
an orbital circularization efficiency of $0.35$, we show that this source is
strong enough to modify the cusp profile within $\approx 0.07$ pc in the
Galactic Center. If the binary fraction at the influence radius is of order
unity and the orbits of all the captured stars are efficiently circularized,
the steeper cusp extends almost as far as the radius of influence of the black

synchronous states when the differences between the units are not small. Here,
we address this problem by presenting a generalization of the master stability
formalism that can be applied to heterogeneous oscillators with large
mismatches. Our approach is based on the simultaneous block diagonalization of
the matrix terms in the variational equation, and it leads to dimension
reduction that simplifies the original equation significantly. This new
formalism allows the systematic investigation of scenarios in which the
oscillators need to be nonidentical in order to reach an identical state, where
all oscillators are completely synchronized. In the case of networks of
identically coupled oscillators, this corresponds to breaking the symmetry of
the system as a means to preserve the symmetry of the dynamical state---a
recently discovered effect termed asymmetry-induced synchronization (AISync).
Our framework enables us to identify communication delay as a new and
potentially common mechanism giving rise to AISync, which we demonstrate using
networks of delay-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. The results also have
potential implications for control, as they reveal oscillator heterogeneity as
an attribute that may be manipulated to enhance the stability of synchronous

accelerators, independent of the task arrival rate, task size distribution, and
resource processing order. We transform the optimal scheduling policy to a

gas-phase metallicity than isolated galaxies. This metallicity deficiency can
be caused by inflows of low-metallicity gas due to the tidal forces and
gravitational torques associated with galaxy mergers, diluting the metal
content of the central region. In this work we demonstrate that such
metallicity dilution occurs in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of
galaxy formation. We find that the dilution is typically 0.1 dex for major
mergers, and is noticeable at projected separations smaller than $40$ kpc. For
minor mergers the metallicity dilution is still present, even though the
amplitude is significantly smaller. Consistent with previous analysis of
observed galaxies we find that mergers are outliers from the \emph{fundamental
metallicity relation}, with deviations being larger than expected for a
Gaussian distribution of residuals. Our large sample of mergers within full
cosmological simulations also makes it possible to estimate how the star
formation rate enhancement and gas consumption timescale behave as a function
of the merger mass ratio. We confirm that strong starbursts are likely to occur
in major mergers, but they can also arise in minor mergers if more than two
galaxies are participating in the interaction, a scenario that has largely been
ignored in previous work based on idealised isolated merger simulations.

techniques can be the key for individualized solutions to a number of eye
pathologies. The development of such techniques largely relies on a
computational modelling of the eyeball and, it optimally requires the synergic
interplay between experimentation and numerical simulation. In Astrophysics and
Geophysics the remote measurement of structural properties of the systems of
their realm is performed on the basis of (helio-)seismic techniques. As a
biomechanical system, the eyeball possesses normal vibrational modes
encompassing rich information about its structure and mechanical properties.
However, the integral analysis of the eyeball vibrational modes has not been
performed yet. Here we develop a new finite difference method to compute both
the spheroidal and, specially, the toroidal eigenfrequencies of the human eye.
Using this numerical model, we show that the vibrational eigenfrequencies of
the human eye fall in the interval 100 Hz - 10 MHz. We find that compressible
vibrational modes may release a trace on high frequency changes of the
intraocular pressure, while incompressible normal modes could be registered
analyzing the scattering pattern that the motions of the vitreous humour leave
on the retina. Existing contact lenses with embebed devices operating at high
sampling frequency could be used to register the microfluctuations of the
eyeball shape we obtain. We advance that an inverse problem to obtain the
mechanical properties of a given eye (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson ratio)
measuring its normal frequencies is doable. These measurements can be done
using non-invasive techniques, opening very interesting perspectives to
estimate the mechanical properties of eyes in vivo. Future research might
relate various ocular pathologies with anomalies in measured vibrational

stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), metallicity ($Z$), neutral
($\rm HI$) and molecular ($\rm H_2$) hydrogen mass. We apply this to the MUFASA
cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, and show that it recovers the mean trends
of output quantities with halo mass highly accurately, including following the
sharp drop in SFR and gas in quenched massive galaxies. However, the scatter
around the mean relations is under-predicted. Examining galaxies individually,
at $z=0$ the stellar mass and metallicity are accurately recovered
($\sigma\lesssim 0.2$~dex), but SFR and $\rm HI$ show larger scatter
($\sigma\gtrsim 0.3$~dex); these values improve somewhat at $z=1,2$.
Remarkably, ML quantitatively recovers second parameter trends in galaxy
properties, e.g. that galaxies with higher gas content and lower metallicity
have higher SFR at a given $M_*$. Testing various ML algorithms, we find that
none perform significantly better than the others, nor does ensembling improve
performance, likely because none of the algorithms reproduce the large observed
scatter around the mean properties. For the random forest algorithm, we find
that halo mass and nearby ($\sim 200$~kpc) environment are the most important
predictive variables followed by growth history, while halo spin and $\sim$Mpc
scale environment are not important. Finally we study the impact of

carefully designed numerical tests, where expected orders of accuracy and rates
of convergence are observed. A rough run-time performance comparison is also
conducted to illustrate the efficiency of our methods. As an application of the
methods, a snap-through thermal buckling problem is considered. The critical
thermal loads of shell buckling with various boundary conditions are
numerically calculated, and snap-through bifurcation curves are also obtained
using our numerical methods together with a pseudo-arclength continuation
method. Our results are consistent with previous studies.

a single to double antiferroelectric-like hysteresis loop of the concentration
voltage dependence that happens with the temperature increase and then exist in
a wide temperature range (from 350 to 500 K). Unexpectedly we revealed the
double loops of polarization and concentration can have irregular shape that
remains irregular as long as the computation takes place, and the voltage
position of the different features (jumps, secondary maxima, etc.) changes from
one period to another, leading to the impression of quasi-chaotic behavior. It
appeared that these effects originate from the nonlinear screening of
ferroelectric polarization by graphene carriers, as well as it is conditioned
by the temperature evolution of the domain structure kinetics in ferroelectric
substrate. The nonlinearity rules the voltage behavior of polarization
screening by graphene 2D-layer and at the same time induces the motion of
separated domain walls accompanied by the motion of p-n junction along the
graphene channel (2D-analog of Hann effect). Since the domain walls structure,
period and kinetics can be controlled by varying the temperature, we concluded
that the considered nano-structures based on graphene-on-ferroelectric are
promising for the fabrication of new generation of modulators based on the

$n$-dimensional complex-valued vector from its phase-less under-determined
linear measurements. The non-linearity of measurements makes designing
theoretically-analyzable efficient phase retrieval algorithms challenging. As a
result, to a great extent, algorithms designed in this area are developed to
take advantage of simple structures such as sparsity and its convex
generalizations. The goal of this paper is to move beyond simple models through
employing compression codes. Such codes are typically developed to take
advantage of complex signal models to represent the signals as efficiently as
possible. In this work, it is shown how an existing compression code can be
treated as a black box and integrated into an efficient solution for phase
retrieval. First, COmpressive PhasE Retrieval (COPER) optimization, a
computationally-intensive compression-based phase retrieval method, is
proposed. COPER provides a theoretical framework for studying compression-based
phase retrieval. The number of measurements required by COPER is connected to
$\kappa$, the $\alpha$-dimension (closely related to the rate-distortion
dimension) of the given family of compression codes. To finds the solution of
COPER, an efficient iterative algorithm called gradient descent for COPER
(GD-COPER) is proposed. It is proven that under some mild conditions on the
initialization, if the number of measurements is larger than $ C \kappa^2
\log^2 n$, where $C$ is a constant, GD-COPER obtains an accurate estimate of
the input vector in polynomial time. In the simulation results, JPEG2000 is
integrated in GD-COPER to confirm the superb performance of the resulting

the classical Poincar\'e analysis for asymptotic stability of periodic

it to construct ISS estimates for the periodic orbit in terms of ISS estimates

of jet densities and Reynolds numbers on vertical buoyant jets were
investigated, as they emerged from the side wall of a circular pipe, through a
round orifice. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced
fluorescence (PLIF) techniques were employed simultaneously to provide
time-averaged flow velocity and concentrations fields. Large eddy simulation
(LES) was applied to provide further detail with regards to the
three-dimensionality of air, helium, and hydrogen jets. These realistic jets
were always asymmetric and found to deflect about the vertical axis. This
deflection was influenced by buoyancy, where heavier gases deflected more than
lighter gases. Significant turbulent mixing was also observed in the near
field. The realistic jets, therefore, experienced faster velocity decay, and
asymmetric jet spreading compared to round jets. These findings indicate that
conventional round jet assumptions are, to some extent, inadequate to predict
gas concentration, entrainment rates and, consequently, the extent of the
flammability envelope of realistic gas leaks.

short-range momentum-dependent correlations non-perturbatively. On the other

therefore expected to lead to a quick convergence of results, and offers the
potential of obtaining smooth self-energies in non-perturbative regimes of
phase space. In this paper, we present an exact cluster dual fermion method
based on an expansion around the dynamical cluster approximation. Unlike
previous formulations, our method does not employ a coarse graining
approximation to the interaction, which we show to be the leading source of
error at high temperature, and converges to the exact result independent of the

results for the second-order cluster dual fermion approximation to the

temporary near field laser heating of the media during write to increase hard
disk drive storage density. By using plasmonic antenna embedded in the write
head, extremely high thermal gradient are created in the recording media (up to
10K/nm). State of the art HAMR media consists of grains of FePtX ordered alloys
exhibiting high perpendicular anisotropy separated by insulating grain
boundaries. Nearby the plasmonic antenna, the difference of temperature between
two 8nm wide neighboring grains in the media can reach 80K, representing a
gigantic thermal gradient of ~40K/nm across the grain boundary. Such situations
with much weaker thermal gradient (~1K/nm, already considered as very large)
have already been studied in the field of spincaloritronics. There, it was
shown that very large spin transfer torques due to thermal gradients can arise
in magnetic tunnel junctions which can even yield magnetization switching.
Considering that two neighboring grains separated by an insulating grain
boundary in a HAMR media can be viewed as a magnetic tunnel junction and that
the thermal gradients in HAMR are one to two orders of magnitude larger than
those existing in conventional spincaloritronics, one may expect a major impact
from these thermal torques on magnetization switching dynamics and therefore on
HAMR recording performances. This paper combines theory, experiments aiming at
determining the polarization of tunneling electrons across the media grain
boundaries, and micromagnetic simulations of recording process. It is shown
that the thermal in-plane torque can have a detrimental impact on the recording
performances by favoring antiparallel magnetic alignment between neighboring
grains during the media cooling. Implications on media design are discussed in
order to limit the impact of these thermal torques.

more than several hundred Myr after the transition from Pop III to Pop II star
formation. Yet conventional astrophysics would tell us that a 10 solar-mass

grow via Eddington-limited accretion. This failure by LCDM constitutes one of
its most serious challenges, requiring exotic `fixes', such as anomalously high
accretion rates, or the creation of enormously massive (~10^5 solar-mass)
seeds, neither of which is ever seen in the local Universe, or anywhere else
for that matter. Indeed, to emphasize this point, J1342+0928 is seen to be
accreting at about the Eddington rate, negating any attempt at explaining its

demonstrate that the discovery of this quasar instead strongly confirms the
cosmological timeline predicted by the R_h=ct universe. We assume conventional

to calculate when a seed needed to start growing as a function of its mass in

tension created in the standard model by the appearance of this massive quasar
so early in its history, we find that in the R_h=ct cosmology, a 10 solar-mass
seed at z~15 (the start of the Epoch of Reionization at t~878 Myr) would have
easily grown into an 8 x 10^8 solar-mass black hole at z=7.54 (t~1.65 Gyr) via

Subsequently, we introduce harmonic disturbances via continuous periodic

complex impedance boundary conditions (IBC), modeling the acoustic response of
two different carbon/carbon (C/C) ultrasonically absorptive porous surfaces,
are applied at the wall. The IBCs are derived as an output of a pore-scale
aeroacoustic analysis -- the inverse Helmholtz Solver (iHS) -- which is able to
return the broadband real and imaginary components of the surface-averaged

attenuation of the harmonically-forced second-mode wave. In particular, we
observe a higher attenuation rate of the introduced waves with frequency of

temperatures much higher than the temperature of the electroweak phase
transition we solve analytically but approximately (using Pade approximants)
the corresponding Boltzmann equations, which describe lepton asymmetry
generation due to the tree-level decays of the heavy neutrinos into standard
model leptons. These leptons are effectively massless at such temperatures. The
current work completes in a rigorous way a preliminary treatment of the same
system, by some of the present authors. In this earlier work, lepton asymmetry
was crudely estimated considering the decay of a right-handed neutrino at rest.
Our present analysis includes thermal momentum modes for the heavy neutrino and
this leads to a total lepton asymmetry which is bigger by a factor of two as
compared to the previous estimate. Nevertheless, our current and preliminary
results for the freezeout are found to be in agreement (within a 12.5%
uncertainty). Our analysis depends on a novel use of Pade approximants to solve
the Boltzmann equations and may be more widely useful in cosmology.

attention, due to emerging interest in technologies raging from Internet of
Things (IoT) networks to simple ""Presence"" applications, which identify the
status of the devices (active or inactive). Numerous Medium Access Control
(MAC) protocols for WSN, which can address the challenge of data collection in
dense networks, were suggested over the years. Most of these protocols utilize
the traditional layering approach, in which the MAC layer is unaware of the
encapsulated packet payload, and therefore there is no connection between the
data collected, the physical layer and the signaling mechanisms. Nonetheless,
in many of the applications that intend to utilize such protocols, nodes may
need to exchange very little information, and do so only sporadically, that is,
while the number of devices in the network can be very large, only a subset
wishes to transmit at any given time. Thus, a tailored protocol, which matches
the signaling, physical layer and access control to traffic patterns is
required.
  In this work, we design and analyze a data collection protocol based on
information theoretic principles. In the suggested protocol, the sink collects
messages from up to K sensors simultaneously, out of a large population of
sensors, without knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without
requiring any synchronization, coordination or management overhead. In other
words, neither the sink nor the other sensors need to know who are the actively
transmitting sensors, and this data is decoded directly from the channel
output. We provide a simple codebook construction with very simple encoding and
decoding procedures. We further design a secure version of the protocol.

operators on metric graphs (quantum graphs) whose Fermi, or Floquet, surface is
reducible. The Floquet surface at an energy level is an algebraic set that
describes all complex wave vectors admissible by the periodic operator at the
given energy. The graphs in this study are obtained by coupling two identical
copies of a periodic quantum graph by edges to form a bilayer graph.
Reducibility of the Floquet surface for all energies ensues when the coupling
edges have potentials belonging to the same asymmetry class. The notion of
asymmetry class is defined in this article through the introduction of an
entire spectral A-function $a(\lambda)$ associated with a potential--two
potentials belong to the same asymmetry class if their A-functions are
identical. Symmetric potentials correspond to $a(\lambda)\equiv0$. If the
potentials of the connecting edges belong to different asymmetry classes, then
typically the Floquet surface is not reducible. An exception occurs when two
copies of certain bipartite graphs are coupled; the Floquet surface in this
case is always reducible. This includes AA-stacked bilayer graphene.

up the processing of a query. The important feature is generating code
dynamically for a specific query. We present the technique of code generation
that is applied to query processing on a raw file. The idea was to customize a
query program with a given query and generate a machine- and query-specific
source code. The generated code is compiled by GCC, Clang or any other C/C++
compiler, and the compiled file is dynamically linked to the main program for
further processing. Code generation reduces the cost of generalizing query
processing. It also avoids the overhead of the conventional interpretation
during achieve high performance. Database Management Systems (DBMSs) perform
excellent jobs in many aspects of big data, such as storage, indexing, and
analysis. DBMSs typically format entire data and load them into their storage
layer. They increase data-to-query time, which is the cost time it takes to
convert data into a specific schema and persist them in a disk. Ideally, DBMSs
should adapt to the input data and extract one/some of columns, not the entire
data, that is/are associated with a given query. Therefore, the query engine on
a raw file can reduce the cost of conventional general operators and avoid some
unnecessary procedures, such as fully scanning, tokenizing and paring the whole
data. In the current study, we introduce our code-generation approach for
in-situ processing of raw files, which is based on the template approach and
the hype approach. The approach minimizes the data-to-query time and achieves a
high performance for query processing. There are some benefits from our work:
reducing branches and instructions, unrolling loops, eliminating unnecessary
data type checks and optimizing the binary code with a compiler on a local
machine.

as NLTE equations), and hydrodynamical equations from (quasi-)hydrostatic
atmosphere to expanding stellar wind. The models allow us to predict wind
density, velocity, and temperature (consequently also the terminal wind
velocity and the mass-loss rate) just from basic global stellar parameters. As
a result of their lower metallicity, the line radiative driving is weaker
leading to lower wind mass-loss rates with respect to the Galactic stars. We
provide a formula that fits the mass-loss rate predicted by our models as a
function of stellar luminosity and metallicity. On average, the mass-loss rate
scales with metallicity as $ \dot M\sim Z^{0.59}$. The predicted mass-loss
rates are lower than mass-loss rates derived from H$\alpha$ diagnostics and can
be reconciled with observational results assuming clumping factor
$C_\text{c}=9$. On the other hand, the predicted mass-loss rates either agree
or are slightly higher than the mass-loss rates derived from ultraviolet wind
line profiles. The calculated \ion{P}{v} ionization fractions also agree with
values derived from observations for LMC stars with

islands. This new MR is apparently not caused by the bulk spin-orbit
interaction because of the negligible spin-orbit interaction in Cu and the
discontinuity of the Pt islands. This SOMR disappears when the Pt islands are
absent or located away from the Cu/YIG interface, therefore we can
unambiguously ascribe it to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction at the interface

consistent with the experimental SOMR results in the angular dependence of
magnetic field and the Cu thickness dependence. Our finding demonstrates the
realization of the spin manipulation by interface engineering.

insecure access control is that the Alexa device not only relies on a
single-factor authentication but also takes voice commands even if no people

a physical presence based access control; that is, they can accept voice
commands only when any person is detected nearby. To this end, we devise a

solutions inside the finite Mach number region, we obtain the pointwise fluid
structure for hard potentials and Maxwellian molecules, and optimal time decay
in the fluid part and sub-exponential time decay in the non-fluid part for soft

sub-exponential decay in the space variable. The singular wave estimate,
regularization estimate and refined weighted energy estimate play important
roles in this paper. Our results largely extend the classical results of Liu-Yu

  Sets",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In successive cancellation (SC) polar decoding, an incorrect estimate of any
prior unfrozen bit may bring about severe error propagation in the following
decoding, thus it is desirable to find out and correct an error as early as
possible. In this paper, we first construct a critical set $S$ of unfrozen
bits, which with high probability (typically $>99\%$) includes the bit where
the first error happens. Then we develop a progressive multi-level bit-flipping
decoding algorithm to correct multiple errors over the multiple-layer critical
sets each of which is constructed using the remaining undecoded subtree
associated with the previous layer. The \emph{level} in fact indicates the
number of \emph{independent} errors that could be corrected. We show that as
the level increases, the block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed
progressive bit flipping decoder competes with the corresponding cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoder,
e.g., a level 4 progressive bit-flipping decoder is comparable to the CA-SCL
decoder with a list size of $L=32$. Furthermore, the average complexity of the
proposed algorithm is much lower than that of a SCL decoder (and is similar to
that of SC decoding) at medium to high signal to noise ratio (SNR).

the non-linear max operation in the Bellman optimality equation makes it
difficult to define conjugate distributions over the value functions. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to off-policy TD methods, called
as ADFQ, which updates beliefs on state-action values, Q, through an online
Bayesian inference method known as Assumed Density Filtering. We formulate an
efficient closed-form solution for the value update by approximately estimating
analytic parameters of the posterior of the Q-beliefs. Uncertainty measures in
the beliefs not only are used in exploration but also provide a natural
regularization for the value update considering all next available actions.
ADFQ converges to Q-learning as the uncertainty measures of the Q-beliefs
decrease and improves common drawbacks of other Bayesian RL algorithms such as
computational complexity. We extend ADFQ with a neural network. Our empirical
results demonstrate that ADFQ outperforms comparable algorithms on various
Atari 2600 games, with drastic improvements in highly stochastic domains or
domains with a large action space.

transition at $\frac{1}{np}$. More precisely for $\varepsilon>0$, we form a
random set $R(\rho_n)$ by including each vertex of $G_n$ independently with

small enough $\varepsilon>0$ and $n$ large enough, all connected components in

question by Krivelevich \cite{krivelevich2016phase} regrading uniqueness of the

will be applicable in other contexts as well.

traffic is challenging the capacity of current wireless systems. To tackle this
challenge, mobile edge caching has emerged as a promising paradigm recently, in
which the service providers (SPs) prefetch some popular contents in advance and
cache them locally at the network edge. When requested, those locally cached
contents can be directly delivered to users with low latency, thus alleviating
the traffic load over backhaul channels during peak hours and enhancing the
quality-of-experience (QoE) of users simultaneously. Due to the limited
available cache space, it makes sense for the SP to cache the most profitable
contents. Nevertheless, users' true valuations of contents are their private
knowledge, which is unknown to the SP in general. This information asymmetry
poses a significant challenge for effective caching at the SP side. Further,
the cached contents can be delivered with different quality, which needs to be
chosen judiciously to balance delivery costs and user satisfaction. To tackle
these difficulties, in this paper, we propose an optimal auction mechanism from
the perspective of the SP. In the auction, the SP determines the cache space
allocation over contents and user payments based on the users' (possibly
untruthful) reports of their valuations so that the SP's expected revenue is
maximized. The advocated mechanism is designed to elicit true valuations from
the users (incentive compatibility) and to incentivize user participation
(individual rationality). In addition, we devise a computationally efficient
method for calculating the optimal cache space allocation and user payments. We
further examine the optimal choice of the content delivery quality for the case
with a large number of users and derive a closed-form solution to compute the
optimal delivery quality.

learning and data mining. It has been successfully applied into various fields.
Most matrix decomposition methods focus on decomposing a data matrix from one
single source. However, it is common that data are from different sources with
heterogeneous noise. A few of matrix decomposition methods have been extended
for such multi-view data integration and pattern discovery. While only few
methods were designed to consider the heterogeneity of noise in such multi-view
data for data integration explicitly. To this end, we propose a joint matrix
decomposition framework (BJMD), which models the heterogeneity of noise by
Gaussian distribution in a Bayesian framework. We develop two algorithms to
solve this model: one is a variational Bayesian inference algorithm, which
makes full use of the posterior distribution; and another is a maximum a
posterior algorithm, which is more scalable and can be easily paralleled.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
BJMD considering the heterogeneity of noise is superior or competitive to the
state-of-the-art methods.

systems: they are used to establish geometric constraints between images,
correct drift in relative pose estimation, and relocalize cameras after lost
tracking. The exact definitions of maps, however, are often
application-specific and hand-crafted for different scenarios (e.g. 3D
landmarks, lines, planes, bags of visual words). We propose to represent maps
as a deep neural net called MapNet, which enables learning a data-driven map
representation. Unlike prior work on learning maps, MapNet exploits cheap and
ubiquitous sensory inputs like visual odometry and GPS in addition to images
and fuses them together for camera localization. Geometric constraints
expressed by these inputs, which have traditionally been used in bundle
adjustment or pose-graph optimization, are formulated as loss terms in MapNet
training and also used during inference. In addition to directly improving
localization accuracy, this allows us to update the MapNet (i.e., maps) in a
self-supervised manner using additional unlabeled video sequences from the
scene. We also propose a novel parameterization for camera rotation which is
better suited for deep-learning based camera pose regression. Experimental
results on both the indoor 7-Scenes dataset and the outdoor Oxford RobotCar
dataset show significant performance improvement over prior work. The MapNet

the geometry of the Kerr-MOG black hole significantly in addition to the ADM
mass and spin parameters. Moreover, the ADM mass and black hole event horizon
definitions allow us to set a novel upper bound on the deformation parameter
and to reveal the correct upper bound on the black hole spin. We further find
the geodesics of motion of stars and photons around the Kerr-MOG black hole. By
using them we reveal the expressions for the mass and the rotation parameter of
the Kerr-MOG black hole in terms of the red- and blueshifts of photons emitted

simple method to further test the general theory of relativity in its strong
field limit: If the measured red- and blueshifts of photons exceed the bounds
imposed by the general theory of relativity, then the black hole is not of Kerr

(ALMA), by utilizing the Chandra 7-Ms data, the deepest X-ray survey to date.
Our millimeter galaxy sample comes from the ASAGAO survey covering 26
arcmin$^2$ (12 sources at a 1.2-mm flux-density limit of $\approx$0.6 mJy),
supplemented by the deeper but narrower 1.3-mm survey of a part of the ASAGAO
field by Dunlop et al.\ (2017). Fourteen out of the total 25 millimeter
galaxies have Chandra counterparts. The observed AGN fractions at $z=1.5-3$ is
found to be 90$^{+8}_{-19}$\% and $57^{+23}_{-25}$\% for the ultra/luminous
infrared galaxies with $\log L_{\rm IR}/L_{\odot} = 12-12.8$ and $\log L_{\rm
IR}/L_{\odot} = 11.5-12$, respectively. The majority ($\sim$2/3) of the ALMA
and/or Herschel detected X-ray AGNs at $z=1.5-3$ appear to be star-formation
dominant populations, having $L_{\rm X}$/ $L_{\rm IR}$ ratios smaller than the
""simultaneous evolution"" value expected from the local black-hole mass to
stellar mass ($M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$) relation. On the basis of the $L_{\rm X}$ and
stellar mass relation, we infer that a large fraction of star-forming galaxies
at $z=1.5-3$ have black hole masses smaller than those expected from the local
$M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation. This is opposite to previous reports on luminous
AGN at same redshifts detected in wider and shallower surveys, which are
subject to selection biases against lower luminosity AGN. Our results are
consistent with an evolutionary scenario that star formation occurs first, and
an AGN-dominant phase follows later, in objects finally evolving into galaxies
with classical bulges.

$10^{-5}$ conversion efficiency with a gradient field contribution to
$\chi^{(3)}_{\mathrm{Au}}$ of up to $10^{-19}~\mathrm{m}^2 / \mathrm{V}^2$. The
results are in good agreement with theory based on plasma hydrodynamics. Our

program faults may be revealed as undesired joint effect of the program

state-of-the-art methods, Inforence tries to identify and select groups of
interdependent statements which altogether may affect the program failure. The
interdependence amongst the statements is measured according to their mutual

cause-effect chains are ranked according to their combined causal effect on

perturbed by the measurement process itself. This includes precision frequency
measurements for atomic clock applications carried out with Ramsey
spectroscopy. With the aim of eliminating probe-induced perturbations, a method
of generalized auto-balanced Ramsey spectroscopy (GABRS) is presented and
rigorously substantiated. Here, the usual local oscillator frequency control
loop is augmented with a second control loop derived from secondary Ramsey
sequences interspersed with the primary sequences and with a different Ramsey
period. This second loop feeds back to a secondary clock variable and
ultimately compensates for the perturbation of the clock frequency caused by
the measurements in the first loop. We show that such a two-loop scheme can
lead to perfect compensation of measurement-induced light shifts and does not
suffer from the effects of relaxation, time-dependent pulse fluctuations and
phase-jump modulation errors that are typical of other hyper-Ramsey schemes.
Several variants of GABRS are explored based on different secondary variables
including added relative phase shifts between Ramsey pulses, external
frequency-step compensation, and variable second-pulse duration. We demonstrate
that a universal anti-symmetric error signal, and hence perfect compensation at
finite modulation amplitude, is generated only if an additional frequency-step
applied during both Ramsey pulses is used as the concomitant variable
parameter. This universal technique can be applied to the fields of atomic
clocks, high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, magnetically induced and
two-photon probing schemes, Ramsey-type mass spectrometry, and to the field of
precision measurements. Some variants of GABRS can also be applied for rf
atomic clocks using CPT-based Ramsey spectroscopy of the two-photon dark
resonance.

The HHCPJaya algorithm divides the population into many small subpopulations,

dimensions. In the hyper-population approach, we increase the small
subpopulations by assigning more than one subpopulation to each core, and each
subpopulation evolves independently to enhance the explorative and exploitative
nature of the population. We combine this hyper-population approach with the
two-level hierarchical cooperative search scheme to find global solutions from
all subpopulations. Furthermore, we incorporate an additional updating phase on

further improving the convergence rate and the quality of solutions. Several

2012ab, mostly obtained over the course of $\sim 300$ days after discovery. SN
2012ab was a Type IIn (SN IIn) event discovered near the nucleus of spiral
galaxy 2MASXJ12224762+0536247. While its light curve resembles that of SN
1998S, its spectral evolution does not. We see indications of CSM interaction
in the strong intermediate-width emission features, the high luminosity (peak
at absolute magnitude $M=-19.5$), and the lack of broad absorption features in
the spectrum. The H$\alpha$ emission undergoes a peculiar transition. At early
times it shows a broad blue emission wing out to $-14{,}000$ km
$\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and a truncated red wing. Then at late times ($>$
100$\,$days) it shows a truncated blue wing and a very broad red emission wing
out to roughly $+20{,}000$ km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This late-time broad red wing
probably arises in the reverse shock. Spectra also show an asymmetric
intermediate-width H$\alpha$ component with stronger emission on the red side
at late times. The evolution of the asymmetric profiles requires a density
structure in the distant CSM that is highly aspherical. Our spectropolarimetric
data also suggest asphericity with a strong continuum polarization of $\sim
1-3$% and depolarization in the H$\alpha$ line, indicating asphericity in the
CSM at a level comparable to that in other SNe IIn. We estimate a mass-loss
rate of $\dot{M} = 0.050\, {\rm M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ for $v_{\rm pre}
= 100$$\,$km$\,$$\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ extending back at least 75$\,$yr prior to the
SN. The strong departure from axisymmetry in the CSM of SN 2012ab may suggest
that the progenitor was an eccentric binary system undergoing eruptive mass
loss.

electron constituting the exciton is suddenly emitted out of the crystal, while
the hole constituting the exciton is still left inside and forced to be
recoiled back to its original valence band. This recoil on the hole is surely
reflected in the spectrum of the PEE with a statistical distribution along the
momentum-energy curve of the valence band. This distribution is nothing but the
square of the exciton wave function amplitude, since it shows how the electron
and the hole are originally bound together. Thus, the momentum-resolved PEE can
directly determine the exciton wave function. These problems are clarified,
taking the $\Gamma$ and the saddle point excitons in GaAs, as typical examples.
New PEE experiments are also suggested.

closed-loop devices that can sense millions of turns. The concept relies on the
reliable propagation of domain walls through a cross-shaped intersection of
magnetic conduits, to allow the intertwining of loops of the sensor device. As
a key step to reach the necessary reliability of the operation, we develop a
combination of tilted wires called the syphon structure at the entrances of the
cross. We measure the control and reliability of the domain wall propagation
individually for cross-shaped intersections, the syphon geometries and finally
combinations of the two for various field configurations (strengths and
angles). The various measured syphon geometries yield a dependence of the
domain wall propagation on the shape that we explain by the effectively acting
transverse and longitudinal external applied magnetic fields. The combination
of both elements yields a behaviour that cannot be explained by a simple
superposition of the individual different maximum field operation values. We
identify as an additional process the nucleation of domain walls in the cross,
which then allows us to fully gauge the operational parameters. Finally, we
demonstrate that by tuning the central dimensions of the cross and choosing the
optimum angle for the syphon structure reliable sensor operation is achieved,

electrically neutral particles on such space-times is described by amplitudes
that exhibit resonant behaviour when the scattering and deficit angles
coincide. This, in turn, leads to ring-like structures where the cross sections

phenomenology of such defects, and, more importantly, of addressing certain

procedure for the formally infinite Legendre series encountered, we manage to
ensure the recovery of the Minkowski space-time, and thus the disappearance of
the lensing phenomenon, in the no-defect limit, and the validity of the optical
theorem for the elastic total cross section. In addition, the singular nature
of the phenomenon is confirmed by means of an alternative calculation, which,

free will are necessary. The key formula \[E(AB|a,b) = \int
A(a,b,\lambda)B(a,b,\lambda)\rho(\lambda) d\lambda\] follows from the logic of
plausible reasoning (the objective Bayesian interpretation of probability
theory) taken alone, without any further assumptions about realism. The space
$\Lambda$, usually interpreted as some space of `hidden variables', can be
constructed for an arbitrary `field of discourse' using Stone's theorem. The
rejection of superdeterminism follows from logical independence -- the
non-existence of information which suggest a dependence -- of the free
decisions of the experimenters from everything else.
  To prove the Bell inequality it is, then, sufficient to reduce this to
\[E(AB|a,b) = \int A(a,\lambda)B(b,\lambda)\rho(\lambda) d\lambda.\] This
follows for space-like separated measurements from Einstein causality alone.
So, the consequence of the violation of Bell's inequality is that Einstein
causality has been empirically falsified, without any loopholes left.
  We consider and reject the idea of weakening the logic of plausible reasoning
could be used to create a loophole. Finally, we discuss what can be used to
replace Einstein causality. While weak (signal) Einstein causality holds, it
follows either from a notion of strong causality or from human inability to
prepare states which violate quantum uncertainty, which makes it uninteresting
for fundamental considerations. A notion of strong causality has either
unacceptable causal loops or requires a hidden preferred frame. Given that a
hidden preferred frame is completely compatible with modern physics, it is
argued that this choice is preferable.

streaming setting. In this model, the graph is presented as a sequence of edges
that can be processed strictly once. Our streaming algorithm has an extremely
low memory footprint as it stores only three integers per node and does not
keep any edge in memory. We provide a theoretical justification of the design
of the algorithm based on the modularity function, which is a usual metric to
evaluate the quality of a graph partition. We perform experiments on massive
real-life graphs ranging from one million to more than one billion edges and we
show that this new algorithm runs more than ten times faster than existing
algorithms and leads to similar or better detection scores on the largest
graphs.

translation, deep learning is receiving growing attention as an approach for
music generation, as witnessed by recent research groups such as Magenta at
Google and CTRL (Creator Technology Research Lab) at Spotify. The motivation is
in using the capacity of deep learning architectures and training techniques to
automatically learn musical styles from arbitrary musical corpora and then to
generate samples from the estimated distribution. However, a direct application
of deep learning to generate content rapidly reaches limits as the generated
content tends to mimic the training set without exhibiting true creativity.
Moreover, deep learning architectures do not offer direct ways for controlling
generation (e.g., imposing some tonality or other arbitrary constraints).
Furthermore, deep learning architectures alone are autistic automata which
generate music autonomously without human user interaction, far from the
objective of interactively assisting musicians to compose and refine music.
Issues such as: control, structure, creativity and interactivity are the focus
of our analysis. In this paper, we select some limitations of a direct
application of deep learning to music generation, analyze why the issues are
not fulfilled and how to address them by possible approaches. Various examples
of recent systems are cited as examples of promising directions.

making it difficult for firms to extend credit, and for potential borrowers to

generate rich data about behavior. This article shows that behavioral
signatures in mobile phone data predict default, using call records matched to
repayment outcomes for credit extended by a South American telecom. On a sample
of individuals with (thin) financial histories, our method actually outperforms
models using credit bureau information, both within time and when tested on a
different time period. But our method also attains similar performance on those
without financial histories, who cannot be scored using traditional methods.
Individuals in the highest quintile of risk by our measure are 2.8 times more
likely to default than those in the lowest quintile. The method forms the basis
for new forms of credit that reach the unbanked.

gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) model based on the gauge group SU(3) x U(1)' in
5-dimensional Minkowski space with a compactification of the 5th dimension on
S^1/Z_2 orbifold. A pair of vector-like SU(3) multiplet fermions in a
higher-dimensional representation is introduced in the bulk, and the DM
particle is identified with the lightest mass eigenstate among the components
in the multiplets. In the original model description, the DM particle
communicates with the Standard Model (SM) particles only through the bulk gauge
interaction, and hence our model is the GHU version of the MDM scenario. There
are two typical realizations of the DM particle in 4-dimensional effective
theory: (i) the DM particle is mostly composed of the SM SU(2)_L multiplets, or
(ii) the DM is mostly composed of the SM SU(2)_L singlets. Since the case (i)
is very similar to the original MDM scenario, we focus on the case (ii), which
is a realization of the Higgs-portal DM scenario in the context of the GHU
model. We identify an allowed parameter region to be consistent with the
current experimental constraints, which will be fully covered by the direct
dark matter detection experiments in the near future. In the presence of the
bulk multiplet fermions in higher-dimensional $SU(3)$ representations, we
reproduce the 125 GeV Higgs boson mass through the renormalization group
evolution of Higgs quartic coupling with the compactification scale of 10-100
TeV.

proteomics is a well-established research field with major applications such as
identification of disease biomarkers, drug discovery, drug design and
development. In proteomics, protein identification and quantification is a
fundamental task, which is done by first enzymatically digesting it into
peptides, and then analyzing peptides by LC-MS/MS instruments. The peptide
feature detection and quantification from an LC-MS map is the first step in
typical analysis workflows. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning
based model, DeepIso, that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to scan an
LC-MS map to detect peptide features and estimate their abundance. Existing
tools are often designed with limited engineered features based on domain
knowledge, and depend on pretrained parameters which are hardly updated despite
huge amount of new coming proteomic data. Our proposed model, on the other
hand, is capable of learning multiple levels of representation of high
dimensional data through its many layers of neurons and continuously evolving
with newly acquired data. To evaluate our proposed model, we use an antibody
dataset including a heavy and a light chain, each digested by Asp-N,
Chymotrypsin, Trypsin, thus giving six LC-MS maps for the experiment. Our model
achieves 93.21% sensitivity with specificity of 99.44% on this dataset. Our
results demonstrate that novel deep learning tools are desirable to advance the
state-of-the-art in protein identification and quantification.
