relevance. Here, we propose a simple generalized theoretical model for
establishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions between individuals
and investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability of
""winning"" depends solely on the relative societal status of the participants,
and the winner has a gain of status whereas there is an equal loss to the
loser. The interactions are characterized by two parameters. The first
parameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter represents
the degree to which even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for
the higher-status individual. Depending on the parameters, the resulting status
distributions reach either a continuous unimodal form or lead to a totalitarian
end state with one high-status individual and all other individuals having
status approaching zero. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived
intermediary distributions often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable
society. As we show, our model allows us to make predictions consistent with
animal interaction data and their evolution over a number of years. Moreover,
by implementing a simple, but realistic rule that restricts interactions to
sufficiently similar-status individuals, the stable or long-lived distributions
acquire high-status structure corresponding to a distinct high-status class.
Using household income as a proxy for societal status in human societies, we
find agreement over their entire range from the low-to-middle-status parts to
the characteristic high-status ""tail"". We discuss how the model provides a
conceptual framework for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the
factors which lead to the preservation or deterioration of the societal
structure.

order to determine the abundance distributions therein. It has been suggested
that the strength of the low-ionization lines, R_2, N_2, and S_2 may be
increased (relative to Balmer lines) in (some) spaxel spectra of the MaNGA
survey due to a contribution of the radiation of the diffuse ionized gas.
Consequently, the abundances derived from the spaxel spectra through
strong-line methods may suffer from large errors. We examined this expectation
by comparing the behaviour of the line intensities and the abundances estimated
through different calibrations for slit spectra of HII regions in nearby
galaxies, for fibre spectra from the SDSS, and for spaxel spectra of the MaNGA
survey. We found that the S_2 strength is increased significantly in the fibre
and spaxel spectra. The mean enhancement changes with metallicity and can be as
large as a factor of 2. The mean distortion of R_2 and N_2 is less than a
factor of 1.3. This suggests that Kaufmann et al.'s demarcation line between
AGNs and HII regions in the BPT diagram is a useful criterion to reject spectra
with significantly distorted strengths of the N_2 and R_2 lines. We find that
the three-dimensional R calibration, which uses the N_2 and R_2 lines, produces
reliable abundances in the MaNGA galaxies. The one-dimensional N2 calibration
produces either reliable or wrong abundances depending on whether excitation
and N/O abundance ratio in the target region (spaxel) are close to or differ
from those parameters in the calibrating points located close to the
calibration relation. We then determined abundance distributions within the
optical radii in the discs of 47 MaNGA galaxies. The optical radii of the
galaxies were estimated from the surface brightness profiles constructed based
on the MaNGA observations.

sites, the conductivity for correlated and ordered adsorbates is found to be
enhanced in dozens of times as compared to the cases of their random

point defects counteracts against or contributes to the band-gap opening
according to their configurations. The band-gap behaviour is found to be
nonmonotonic with strain in case of a simultaneous action of defect ordering
and zigzag deformation. The amount of localized charge carriers (spins) is
found to be correlated with the content of adsorbed centres responsible for the
formation of potential barriers and, in turn, for the localization effects.
Physical and chemical states of graphene edges, especially at a uniaxial strain

solution confined within a tapered, Hele-Shaw device with a small opening angle

and translation of nanoscale bubbles, ranging in diameter from tens to hundreds
of nanometers, carried out with liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy.
In our experiments, the electron beam plays a dual role: it supersaturates the
solution with gaseous radiolysis products, which lead to bubble nucleation and
growth, and it provides a means to image the bubbles in-situ with nanoscale
resolution. To understand our experimental data, we propose a migration
mechanism, based on Blake-Haynes theory, which is applicable in the asymptotic
limits of zero capillary and Bond numbers and high confinement. Consistent with
experimental data, our model predicts that in the presence of confinement,
growth rates are orders of magnitude slower compared to a bubble growing in the
bulk and that the combination of a tapered channel and contact line pinning
create tear-drop shaped bubbles.

fundamental challenges that have given rise to numerous applications targeting
transformation and cleaning of data. However, while schema design, data
cleaning, and data migration are nowadays reasonably well understood in
isolation, not much attention has been given to the interplay between the tools
that address issues in these areas. Our focus is on the problem of determining
whether there exist sequences of data-transforming procedures that, when
applied to the (untransformed) input data, would yield data satisfying the
conditions required for performing the task in question. Our goal is to develop
a framework that would address this problem, starting with the relational
setting.
  In this paper we abstract data-processing tools as black-box procedures. This
abstraction describes procedures by a specification of which parts of the
database might be modified by the procedure, as well as by the constraints that
specify the required states of the database before and after applying the
procedure. We then proceed to study fundamental algorithmic questions arising
in this context, such as understanding when one can guarantee that sequences of
procedures apply to original or transformed data, when they succeed at
improving the data, and when knowledge bases can represent the outcomes of
procedures. Finally, we turn to the problem of determining whether the
application of a sequence of procedures to a database results in the
satisfaction of properties specified by either queries or constraints. We show
that this problem is decidable for some broad and realistic classes of
procedures and properties, even when procedures are allowed to alter the schema

cutting RIR tail more than this threshold harms the speech recognition accuracy

discontinuous solutions of conservation laws with high-order numerical
discretizations that support inter-element solution discontinuities, such as
discontinuous Galerkin methods. The proposed method aims to align inter-element
boundaries with discontinuities in the solution by deforming the computational
mesh. A discontinuity-aligned mesh ensures the discontinuity is represented
through inter-element jumps while smooth basis functions interior to elements
are only used to approximate smooth regions of the solution, thereby avoiding
Gibbs' phenomena that create well-known stability issues. Therefore, very
coarse high-order discretizations accurately resolve the piecewise smooth
solution throughout the domain, provided the discontinuity is tracked. Central
to the proposed discontinuity-tracking framework is a discrete PDE-constrained
optimization formulation that simultaneously aligns the computational mesh with
discontinuities in the solution and solves the discretized conservation law on
this mesh. The optimization objective is taken as a combination of the the
deviation of the finite-dimensional solution from its element-wise average and
a mesh distortion metric to simultaneously penalize Gibbs' phenomena and
distorted meshes. We advocate a gradient-based, full space solver where the
mesh and conservation law solution converge to their optimal values
simultaneously and therefore never require the solution of the discrete
conservation law on a non-aligned mesh. The merit of the proposed method is
demonstrated on a number of one- and two-dimensional model problems including
2D supersonic flow around a bluff body. We demonstrate optimal
$\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$ convergence rates in the $L^1$ norm for up to polynomial
order $p=6$ and show that accurate solutions can be obtained on extremely
coarse meshes.

Rev. A \textbf{95}, 032133 (2017)] showed that even though this is partially
true, there is a broader physical scenario in which space and time can be
handled in nonrelativistic quantum theory in a more symmetric way. In this
space-time-symmetric formalism, an additional Hilbert space is defined so that
time is raised to the status of operator and position becomes a parameter. As a
consequence, the Hilbert space now requires a space-conditional quantum state
governed by a new quantum dynamics. In this manuscript, we reveal some physical

symmetries between the Hamilton-Jacobi and the space-conditional equation; the

due to its wide applicability in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
systems. There is a rich set of methods described in the literature how to
geometrically register a 2D image w.r.t.\ a 3D model. Recently, methods based
on deep (and convolutional) feedforward networks (CNNs) became popular for pose
regression. However, these CNN-based methods are still less accurate than
geometry based methods despite being fast and memory efficient. In this work we
design a deep neural network architecture based on sparse feature descriptors
to estimate the absolute pose of an image. Our choice of using sparse feature
descriptors has two major advantages: first, our network is significantly
smaller than the CNNs proposed in the literature for this task---thereby making
our approach more efficient and scalable. Second---and more importantly---,
usage of sparse features allows to augment the training data with synthetic
viewpoints, which leads to substantial improvements in the generalization
performance to unseen poses. Thus, our proposed method aims to combine the best
of the two worlds---feature-based localization and CNN-based pose
regression--to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the absolute pose
estimation. A detailed analysis of the proposed architecture and a rigorous
evaluation on the existing datasets are provided to support our method.

line-deshadowing instability (LDI) in hot-star winds, to quantify how the
associated highly clumped density structure can lead to a ""turbulent porosity""
reduction in continuum absorption and/or scattering. The basic method is to
examine the statistical variations of mass column as a function of path length,
and fit these to analytic forms that lead to simple statistical scalings for
the associated mean extinction. A key result is that one can characterize
porosity effects on continuum transport in terms of a single ""turbulent
porosity length"", found here to scale as $H \approx (f_{\rm cl} - 1) a$, where
$f_{\rm cl} \equiv \left < \rho^2 \right >/\left < \rho \right >^2$ is the
clumping factor in density $\rho$, and $a$ is the density autocorrelation
length. For continuum absorption or scattering in an optically thick layer, we
find the associated effective reduction in opacity scales as $\sim
1/\sqrt{1+\tau_{\rm H}}$, where $\tau_{\rm H} \equiv \kappa \rho H$ is the
local optical thickness of this porosity length. For these LDI simulations, the
inferred porosity lengths are small, only about a couple percent of the stellar
radius, $H \approx 0.02 R_\ast$. For continuum processes like bound-free
absorption of X-rays that are only marginally optically thick throughout the
full stellar wind, this implies $\tau_{\rm H} \ll 1$, and thus that
LDI-generated porosity should have little effect on X-ray transport in such
winds. The formalism developed here could however be important for
understanding the porous regulation of continuum-driven, super-Eddington
outflows from luminous blue variables.

Schubert classes in the Chow group of Grassmannian under the Gauss map.
Moreover, we show that if the characteristic of $\kappa$ is $0$, then the Chern

\cdots, \frac{c_{n}}{c_{1^n}})$ are contained in a convex polyhedron for all

whether the region described by the Chern ratios is bounded, posted by Hunt

Parameterization using neural networks makes it feasible to handle cases with a

the so called ""forbidden singularities"", arising from the emergent thermal

series of zeros that condense into branch cuts as $c\to\infty$. We also discuss
some interesting evidences connecting these to the Stoke's phenomena, which are
non-perturbative $e^{-c}$ effects. As a related aspect of these probe
modifications, we also compute the Renyi-entropy $S_n$ in high energy

increase of the number of molecules inside the cavity. This is caused by a loss
of resonance condition of the laser with the bright electronic-photonic states

the energy transferred per molecule and the trigger probability remains
independent of the number of molecules in the cavity.

recently emerged as a key role in the mechanics of highly deformable soft

instability of soft hollow cylinder are analyzed. By incorporating surface
energy density function into the constitutive model of a hyper-elastic theory,
explicit solutions are obtained for the deformation of soft hollow cylinder
under the conditions of uniform pressure loading and geometric everting. It is
found that surface tension evidently alters the deformation of the soft
cylinder. Specifically, the surface stiffness resists the deformation, but the
residual surface stress is inclined to larger deformation. Effects of surface
stress on the instability of the soft hollow cylinder is also explored. For
both the pressure loading and geometric everting conditions, significant
changes in critical condition of the creases are found by varying the surface
parameter. The results in this work reveal that surface energy obviously
influences both the deformation and the instability of soft hollow cylinder at
finite deformation. The obtained results will be helpful for understanding and
predicting the mechanical behavior of soft structures accurately.

many modern applications due to the tremendous growth in bandwidth requirement.
Many approaches so far have focused on improving either the memory access
latency or the bandwidth utilization for specific applications. Moreover, the
application systems are likely to require certain adjustments to connect with
an MPMC, since the MPMC interface is limited to a single-clock and single
data-width domain. In this paper, we propose efficient techniques to improve
the flexibility, latency, and bandwidth of an MPMC. Firstly, MPMC interfaces
employ a pair of dual-clock dual-port FIFOs at each port, so any multi-clock
multi-data-width application system can connect to an MPMC without requiring
extra resources. Secondly, memory access latency is significantly reduced
because parallel FIFOs temporarily keep the data transfer between the
application system and memory. Lastly, a proposed arbitration scheme, namely
window-based first-come-first-serve, considerably enhances the bandwidth
utilization. Depending on the applications, MPMC can be properly configured by
updating several internal configuration registers. The experimental results in
an Altera Cyclone FPGA prove that MPMC is fully operational at 150 MHz and
supports up to 32 concurrent connections at various clocks and data widths.
More significantly, achieved bandwidth utilization is approximately 93.2% of
the theoretical bandwidth, and the access latency is minimized as compared to
previous designs.

successful in classification tasks across different domains. However, there are
two big drawbacks to CNN's: their failure to take into account of important
spatial hierarchies between features, and their lack of rotational invariance.
As long as certain key features of an object are present in the test data,
CNN's classify the test data as the object, disregarding features' relative
spatial orientation to each other. This causes false positives. The lack of
rotational invariance in CNN's would cause the network to incorrectly assign
the object another label, causing false negatives. To address this concern,
Hinton et al. propose a novel type of neural network using the concept of
capsules in a recent paper. With the use of dynamic routing and reconstruction
regularization, the capsule network model would be both rotation invariant and
spatially aware. The capsule network has shown its potential by achieving a
state-of-the-art result of 0.25% test error on MNIST without data augmentation

self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is required. However,
since the radio signals for energy harvesting and for backscattering come from
the ambient, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications depends largely
on environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission
load of ambient energy sources. Therefore, we design two mode selection
protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation
to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to characterize the
impacts of the considered environment factors on the hybrid D2D communication
performance. Together with extensive simulations, our analysis shows that the
communication performance benefits from larger repulsion, transmission load and

(WD) and an M-type star, and shows non-thermal, pulsed, and highly linearly
polarized emission. The radio/optical emission modulates with the WD's spin and
show the double peak structure in the light curves. In this paper, we discuss a
possible scenario for the radiation mechanism of AR~Scorpii. The magnetic
interaction on the surface of the companion star produces an outflow from the
companion star, the heating of the companion star surface, and the acceleration
of electrons to a relativistic energy. The accelerated electrons, whose typical
Lorentz factor is $\sim 50-100$, from the companion star move along the
magnetic field lines toward the WD surface. The electrons injected with the
pitch angle of $\sin\theta_{p,0}>0.05$ are subject to the magnetic mirror
effect and are trapped in the closed magnetic field line region.We find that
the emission from the first magnetic mirror points mainly contributes to the
observed pulsed emission and the formation of the double-peak structure in the
light curve. For the inclined rotator, the pulse peak in the calculated light
curve shifts the position in the spin phase, and a Fourier analysis exhibits a
beat frequency feature, which are consistent with the optical/UV observations.
The pulse profile also evolves with the orbital phase owing to the effect of
the viewing geometry. The model also interprets the global features of the
observed spectral energy distribution in radio to X-ray energy bands. We also
discuss the curvature radiation and the inverse-Compton scattering process in
the outer gap accelerator of the WD in AR Scorpii and discuss the possibility
of the detection by future high-energy missions.

An effective gauge field generally arises when we change a basis to describe

ferromagnetic metals we consider, it arises from structures of localized spin
(magnetization) and couples to spin current of conduction electron. The first
half of the paper is devoted to quantum mechanical arguments and phenomenology.
We show that the spin gauge field has adiabatic and nonadiabatic (off-diagonal)
components, consisting an SU(2) gauge field. The adiabatic component gives rise
to spin Berry's phase, topological Hall effect and spin motive force, while
nonadiabatic components are essential for spin-transfer torque and spin pumping
effects by inducing nonequilibrium spin accumulation. In the latter part of the
paper, field theoretic approaches are described. Dynamics of localized spins in
the presence of applied spin-polarized current is studied in a microscopic
viewpoint, and current-driven domain wall motion is discussed. Recent
developments on interface spin-orbit interaction is also mentioned.

the renormalization of perturbative interacting quantum field theories. Our
main result shows that spectrally regularized Feynman amplitudes admit an
analytic continuation as meromorphic germs with linear poles in the sense of
the works of Guo-Paycha and the second author. We also give an explicit

on suitable resolution of singularities of products of heat kernels to make

projection from meromorphic germs with linear poles on holomorphic germs to
construct renormalization maps which subtract singularities of Feynman

reconstruction from a single image. Face expression reconstruction from a
single image is a challenging task in computer vision. Most state-of-the-art
methods fit the input image to a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM). These methods need
to solve a stochastic problem and cannot deal with expression and pose
variations. To solve this problem, we adopt a 3D face expression model and use
a combined feature which is robust to scale, rotation and different lighting
conditions. The proposed method applies a cascaded regression framework to
estimate parameters for the 3DMM. 2D landmarks are detected and used to
initialize the 3D shape and mapping matrices. In each iteration, residues
between the current 3DMM parameters and the ground truth are estimated and then
used to update the 3D shapes. The mapping matrices are also calculated based on
the updated shapes and 2D landmarks. HOG features of the local patches and
displacements between 3D landmark projections and 2D landmarks are exploited.
Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is robust to expression and
pose changes and can reconstruct higher fidelity 3D face shape.

discriminate pathology from normal tissue during in-vivo imaging. In this
paper, we propose a new RPM model to simultaneously compute AC and BSC for
harmonic imaging and a normalized score that combines the two parameters as a
measure of disease progression. The model utilizes the spectral difference
between two regions of interest, the first, a proximal, close to the probe and
second, a distal, away from the probe. We have implemented an algorithm based
on the model and shown that it provides accurate and stable estimates to within
5% of AC and BSC for simulated received echo from post-focal depths of a
homogeneous liver-like medium. For practical applications with time gain and
time frequency compensated in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data from ultrasound
scanner, the method has been approximated and generalized to estimate AC and
BSC for tissue layer underlying a more attenuative subcutaneous layer. The
angular spectrum approach for ultrasound propagation in biological tissue is
employed as a virtual Reference Phantom (VRP). The VRP is calibrated with a
fixed probe and scanning protocol for application to liver tissue. In a
feasibility study with 16 subjects, the method is able to separate 9/11 cases
of progressive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from 5 normal. In particular,
it is able to separate 4/5 cases of non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis and early
fibrosis (F<=2) from normal tissue. More extensive clinical studies are needed
to assess the full capability of this model for screening and monitoring
disease progression in liver and other tissues.

Jy at 1 GHz) with a duration of milliseconds or less at extragalactic distances
estimated from their large dispersion measure (DM). We propose herein a
scenario for a collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD) as
the progenitor of the FRBs by considering the burst duration scaling to the
collision time and the radio luminosity proportional to the kinetic energy of
the collision. The relations among the observed flux density, pulse width, and
the DM are derived from the model and compared with the statistical results
from the observed FRBs. Although the sample is quite small, we tentatively
report a nearly inverse-square correlation between the observed peak flux
density and the DM excess, which is an consequence of the assumption that the
DM excess (i.e. that not due to our Galaxy) is dominated by the intergalactic
medium. We also tentatively note a correlation among the duration of the FRB
and the DM excess (possibly interpreted as due to the broadening of the signal
in the intergalactic medium) and a correlation among the duration of the FRB
and the flux density (shorter burst should be brighter), both roughly in
agreement with the proposed model.

The sight line of the background quasar ( $z_q$= 1.5266) passes through a
region of the galaxy ($z_g$=0.0169) at an impact parameter of 6.9 kpc with high
metallicity (0.5 Z$_\odot$) and negligible dust extinction. We detect HI 21-cm
absorption from the foreground galaxy at arcsecond and milliarcsecond scales.
For typical cold neutral medium (CNM) temperatures in the Milky Way, this 21-cm
absorber can be classified as a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber (DLA). We infer the
harmonic mean spin temperature of the gas to be $\sim$400 K and for a simple
two-phase medium we estimate the CNM-fraction to be $f_{\rm CNM}$ = 0.27. This
is remarkably consistent with the CNM fraction observed in the Galaxy and less
than that of high-redshift DLAs. The quasar exhibits a core-jet morphology on
milliarcsecond scales, corresponding to an overall extent of $\sim$9 pc at
$z_g$. We show that the size of CNM absorbing clouds associated with the
foreground galaxy is $>$5 pc and they may be part of cold gas structures that
extend beyond $\sim$35 pc. Interestingly, the rotation measure of quasar
J1243+4043 is higher than any other source in samples of quasars with high-$z$
DLAs. However, we do not find any detectable differences in RMs and
polarization fraction of sight lines with or without high-$z$ ($z\ge2$) DLAs or
low-$z$ ($z\le0.3$) 21-cm absorbers. Finally, the foreground galaxy UGC07904 is
also part of a galaxy group. We serendipitously detect HI 21-cm emission from
four members of the group, and a $\sim$80 kpc long HI bridge connecting two of
the other members. The latter, together with the properties of the group
members, suggests that the group is a highly interactive environment.

nova SSS J122221.7-311525 (SSS122222) from 6 days after discovery. Only a
handful of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae have been observed in X-rays, and until
recently GW Lib was the only binary of this type with complete coverage of an
X-ray light curve throughout a superoutburst. We collected extensive X-ray data
of a second such system to understand the extent to which the unexpected
properties of GW Lib are common to the WZ Sge class. We analysed the X-ray
light curve and compared it with the behaviour of superhumps which were
detected in the optical light curve. We also performed spectral analysis of the
data. The results were compared with the properties of GW Lib, for which new
X-ray observations were also obtained. SSS122222 was variable and around five
times brighter in 0.3-10 keV X-rays during the superoutburst than in
quiescence, mainly because of a significant strengthening of a high-energy
component of the X-ray spectrum. The post-outburst decline of the X-ray flux
lasted at least 500 d. The data show no evidence of the expected optically
thick boundary layer in the system during the outburst. SSS122222 also
exhibited a sudden X-ray flux change in the middle of the superoutburst, which
occurred exactly at the time of the superhump stage transition. A similar X-ray
behaviour was also detected in GW Lib. This result demonstrates a relationship
between the outer disc and the white dwarf boundary layer for the first time,
and suggests that models for accretion discs in high mass ratio accreting
binaries are currently incomplete. The very long decline to X-ray quiescence is
also in strong contrast to the expectation of low viscosity in the disc after
outburst.

to the state of turbulent reconnection. We analyze in this article, for the

sub-Alfv\'enic speed with UCSs. The magnetic disturbances interact
stochastically (second order Fermi) with the charged particles and they play a
crucial role in the heating of the particles, while the UCS interact
systematically (first order Fermi) and play a crucial role in the formation of
the high energy tail. The synergy of stochastic and systematic acceleration
provided by the mixture of magnetic disturbances and UCSs influences the
energetics of the thermal and non-thermal particles, the power law index, and
the time the particles remain inside the energy release volume. We show that
this synergy can explain the observed very fast and impulsive particle
acceleration and the slightly delayed formation of a super-hot particle
population.

importantly to symplectic manifolds equipped with a Gromov metric.
  The Lagrange Monge-Ampere operator is an explicit polynomial on ${\rm

Interestingly the operator depends only on the Laplacian and the SKEW-Hermitian
part of the Hessian. The Dirichlet problem for this operator is solved in both
the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. The homogeneous case is also solved
for each of the other branches.

An analogue of the Levi Problem is proved. In ${\bf C}^n$ there is another
concept, Lag-plurihamonics, which relate in several ways to the harmonics on
any domain. Parallels of this Lagrangian potential theory with standard
(complex) pluripotential theory are constantly emphasized.

vectorlike matter or superpartners are expected within 1.7 TeV (2.5 TeV) based
on all three gauge couplings being simultaneously within 1.5\% (5\%) from
observed values. This range extends to about 4 TeV for $\alpha_G > 0.2$. We
also find that in the scenario with two additional large Yukawa couplings of
vectorlike quarks the IR fixed point value of the top Yukawa coupling
independently points to a multi-TeV range for vectorlike matter and
superpartners. Assuming a universal value for all large Yukawa couplings at the
GUT scale, the measured top quark mass can be obtained from the IR fixed point
for $\tan \beta \simeq 4$. The range expands to any $\tan \beta > 3$ for
significant departures from the universality assumption. Considering that the
Higgs boson mass also points to a multi-TeV range for superpartners in the
MSSM, adding a complete vectorlike family at the same scale provides a
compelling scenario where the values of gauge couplings and the top quark mass
are understood as a consequence of the particle content of the model.

deems necessary to use datacenter networks effectively and efficiently.
Datacenter traffic is often a mix of several classes with different priorities
and requirements. This includes user-generated interactive traffic, traffic
with deadlines, and long-running traffic. To this end, custom transport
protocols and traffic management techniques have been developed to improve
datacenter network performance.
  In this tutorial paper, we review the general architecture of datacenter
networks, various topologies proposed for them, their traffic properties,
general traffic control challenges in datacenters and general traffic control
objectives. The purpose of this paper is to bring out the important
characteristics of traffic control in datacenters and not to survey all
existing solutions (as it is virtually impossible due to massive body of
existing research). We hope to provide readers with a wide range of options and
factors while considering a variety of traffic control mechanisms. We discuss
various characteristics of datacenter traffic control including management
schemes, transmission control, traffic shaping, prioritization, load balancing,
multipathing, and traffic scheduling. Next, we point to several open challenges
as well as new and interesting networking paradigms. At the end of this paper,
we briefly review inter-datacenter networks that connect geographically
dispersed datacenters which have been receiving increasing attention recently
and pose interesting and novel research problems.

upon as a possible candidate for increasing the efficiency of the transfer
process between the energy transmitter (ET) and the energy receiver (ER) in
wireless energy transfer. This paper introduces a novel scheme that facilitates
energy beamforming by utilizing Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
values to estimate the channel. Firstly, in the training stage, the ET will
transmit sequentially using each beamforming vector in a codebook, which is
pre-defined using a Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis. The RSSI value
corresponding to each beamforming vector is fed back to the ET, and these
values are used to estimate the channel through a maximum likelihood analysis.
The results that are obtained are remarkably simple, requires minimal
processing, and can be easily implemented. Also, the results are general and
hold for all well known fading models. The paper also validates the analytical
results numerically, as well as experimentally, and it is shown that the
proposed method achieves impressive results in wireless energy transfer.

The dynamics of the generated video sequence are imported from a source video

the spatial construct of the target image, the appearance of the source video
sequence is suppressed and only the dynamics are obtained before being imposed
onto the target image. That is achieved using the proposed appearance
suppressed dynamics feature. Moreover, the spatial and temporal consistencies
of the generated video sequence are verified via two discriminator networks.
One discriminator validates the fidelity of the generated frames appearance,
while the other validates the dynamic consistency of the generated video
sequence. Experiments have been conducted to verify the quality of the video

Transfer GAN successfully transferred arbitrary dynamics of the source video

  Caching","Submitted for possible journal publications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless communication enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged
as an appealing technology for many application scenarios in future wireless
systems. However, the limited endurance of UAVs greatly hinders the practical
implementation of UAV-enabled communications. To overcome this issue, this
paper proposes a novel scheme for UAV-enabled communications by utilizing the
promising technique of proactive caching at the users. Specifically, we focus
on content-centric communication systems, where a UAV is dispatched to serve a
group of ground nodes (GNs) with random and asynchronous requests for files
drawn from a given set. With the proposed scheme, at the beginning of each
operation period, the UAV pro-actively transmits the files to a subset of
selected GNs that cooperatively cache all the files in the set. As a result,
when requested, a file can be retrieved by each GN either directly from its
local cache or from its nearest neighbor that has cached the file via
device-to-device (D2D) communications. It is revealed that there exists a
fundamental trade-off between the file caching cost, which is the total time
required for the UAV to transmit the files to their designated caching GNs, and
the file retrieval cost, which is the average time required for serving one
file request. To characterize this trade-off, we formulate an optimization
problem to minimize the weighted sum of the two costs, via jointly designing
the file caching policy, the UAV trajectory and communication scheduling. As
the formulated problem is NP-hard in general, we propose efficient algorithms
to find high-quality approximate solutions for it. Numerical results are
provided to corroborate our study and show the great potential of proactive
caching for overcoming the limited endurance issue in UAV-enabled
communications.

cylinder waveguide pipe with a self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity. Three generic
solitary modes, one belonging to the zero-harmonic (0H) and the other two
belonging to the first-harmonic (1H), are found in the first rotational
Brillouin zone. The 0H solitary modes can be termed as a quasi-1D
(one-dimensional) temporal soliton. Their characteristics depend only on the
energy flow. The 1H solitary mode can be termed a quasi-2D (two-dimensional)
bullet, whose width is much narrower than the angular domain of the waveguide.
In contrast to the 0H mode, the characteristics of the 1H solitary mode depend
on both their energy flow and the rotating speed of the waveguide. We
demonstrate numerically that the 1H solitary modes are stable when their energy
flow is smaller than the threshold norm of the \emph{Townes soliton}. The
boundaries of the bistable area for these two types of solitary modes are
predicted by the analyses via two-mode approximation. This prediction is in
accordance with the numerical findings. We also demonstrate analytically that
the 1H solitary mode of this system can be applied to emulate the nonlinear
dynamics of solitary modes with 1D Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling by optics.
Two degenerated states of the 1H solitary mode, semi-dipole and mixed mode, are
found from this setting via the mechanism of SO coupling. Collisions between
the pair of these two types of solitary modes are also discussed in the paper.
The pair of the 0H solitary mode features only the elastic collision, whereas
the pair of 1H solitary modes can feature both elastic and inelastic collision
when the total energy flow of the two modes are smaller or close to the
threshold norm of the \emph{Townes soliton}.

proposed type of massive MIMO transmit beamforming is zero-forcing, which is
based on the right inverse of the overall MIMO channel matrix to force the
inter-user interference to zero. The performance of massive MIMO is then
analyzed based on the throughput of cell-edge users. This paper reassesses this
beamforming philosophy, to instead consider the maximization of the energy
efficiency of massive MIMO systems in assuring the quality-of- service (QoS)
for as many users as possible. The bottleneck of serving small numbers of users
by a large number of transmit antennas is unblocked by a new time-fraction-wise
beamforming technique, which focuses signal transmission in fractions of a time
slot. Accordingly, massive MIMO can deliver better quality-of-experience (QoE)
in assuring QoS for much larger numbers of users. The provided simulations show
that the numbers of users served by massive MIMO with the required QoS may be
twice or more than the number of its transmit antennas.

used in the astronomical literature to reflect a lack of prior knowledge, but
checking whether the resulting posterior is a probability distribution is
sometimes neglected. It turns out that 23 articles out of 75 articles (30.7%)
published online in two renowned astronomy journals (ApJ and MNRAS) between Jan
1, 2017 and Oct 15, 2017 make use of Bayesian analyses without rigorously
establishing posterior propriety. A disturbing aspect is that a Gibbs-type
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method can produce a seemingly reasonable
posterior sample even when the posterior is not a probability distribution
(Hobert and Casella, 1996). In such cases, researchers may erroneously make
probabilistic inferences without noticing that the MCMC sample is from a
non-existing probability distribution. We review why checking posterior

important in particular for the spintronics applications. In this work, we
study the dynamics of isolated skyrmions and antiskyrmions in frustrated
magnets driven by magnetic field gradient, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
simulations on the frustrated classical Heisenberg model on the triangular
lattice. A Hall-like motion induced by the gradient is revealed in bulk system,
similar to that in the well-studied chiral magnets. More interestingly, our
work suggests that the lateral confinement in nano-stripes of the frustrated
system can completely suppress the Hall motion and significantly speed up the
motion along the gradient direction. The simulated results are well explained
by the Thiele theory. It is demonstrated that the acceleration of the motion is
mainly determined by the Gilbert damping constant, which provides useful
information for finding potential materials for skyrmion-based spintronics.

usually exhibits multiple resonances as a function of gate voltage and high
nonlinearity in bias. Such behavior is unpredictable and changes sample by
sample. Here, we report the observation of a sharp transition of the
transmission through an open QPC at finite bias, which was observed
consistently for all the tested QPCs. It is found that the bias dependence of
the transition can be fitted to the Fermi-Dirac distribution function through
universal scaling. The fitted temperature matches quite nicely to the electron
temperature measured via shot-noise thermometry. While the origin of the
transition is unclear, we propose a phenomenological model based on our
experimental results that may help to understand such a sharp transition.
Similar transitions are observed in the fractional quantum Hall regime, and it
is found that the temperature of the system can be measured by rescaling the
quasiparticle energy with the effective charge ($e^*=e/3$). We believe that the
observed phenomena can be exploited as a tool for measuring the electron
temperature of the system and for studying the quasiparticle charges of the
fractional quantum Hall states.

wind has exhumed a stratigraphic section of >=4 unconformity-bounded
sedimentary rock packages, recording >=3 distinct episodes of surface runoff.
Early deposits (>700m thick) are embayed by river deposits (>400m), which are
in turn unconformably draped by fan-shaped deposits (<100m) which we interpret
as alluvial fans. Yardang-forming deposits (>900 m) unconformably drape all
previous deposits. River deposits embay a dissected sedimentary-rock landscape,
and comprise >=2 distinguishable units. The total interval spanned by river
deposits is >(1x10^6-2x10^7) yr; more if we include alluvial-fan deposits.
Alluvial-fan deposits unconformably postdate thrust faults which crosscut river
deposits. We infer a relatively dry interval of >4x10^7 yr after river deposits
formed and before fan-shaped deposits formed. The time gap between the end of
river deposition and the onset of yardang-forming deposits is constrained to
>10^8 yr by the density of impact craters embedded at the unconformity. We
correlate yardang-forming deposits to the upper layers of Gale crater's mound
(Mt. Sharp/Aeolis Mons), and fan-shaped deposits to Peace Vallis fan.
Alternations between periods of low vs. high mean obliquity may have modulated
erosion-deposition cycling in Aeolis. This is consistent with results from an
ensemble of simulations of Solar System orbital evolution and the resulting
history of Mars obliquity. Almost all simulations yield intervals of
continuously low mean Mars obliquity that are long enough to match our
unconformity data.

environmental protection. Quantitative toxicity analysis has become a new
standard in the field. This work introduces element specific persistent

abstraction of geometric complexity and provides a representation of small
molecules that cannot be obtained by any other method. To investigate the
representability and predictive power of ESPH for small molecules, ancillary
descriptors have also been developed based on physical models. Topological and
physical descriptors are paired with advanced machine learning algorithms, such
as deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting decision
tree (GBDT), to facilitate their applications to quantitative toxicity
predictions. A topology based multi-task strategy is proposed to take the
advantage of the availability of large data sets while dealing with small data
sets. Four benchmark toxicity data sets that involve quantitative measurements
are used to validate the proposed approaches. Extensive numerical studies
indicate that the proposed topological learning methods are able to outperform
the state-of-the-art methods in the literature for quantitative toxicity

interface surfaces, volumes and cavities. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics
simulations of a macromolecule are slow as the number of solvent atoms
considered typically increases by order of magnitude. Implicit methods model
the solvent via continuous corrections to the force field based on estimates of
the solvent exposed surface areas of individual atoms, gaining speed at the
expense of accuracy. However, Laguerre cells of exterior atoms tend to be
overly large or unbounded. Our method, the Laguerre-Intersection method, caps
cells in a physically accurate manner by considering the intersection of the
space-filling diagram with the Laguerre tessellation. This method optimizes an
adjustable parameter, the weight, to ensure the areas and volumes of capped
cells exposed to solvent are as close as possible, on average, to those
computed from equilibrated explicit solvent simulations. The contact planes are
radical planes, meaning that as the solvent weight is varied, cells remain
constant. We test the consistency of our model using a high-quality trajectory
of HIV-protease, a dimer with flexible loops and open-close transitions. We
also compare our results with interval-arithmetic Gauss-Bonnet based method.
Optimal solvent parameters quickly converge, which we use to illustrate the
increased accuracy of the Laguerre-Intersection method over two recently
proposed methods as compared to the explicit model.

properties of small molecules. Accurate theoretical prediction of aqueous
solubility and partition coefficient plays an important role in drug design and
discovery. The prediction accuracy depends crucially on molecular descriptors
which are typically derived from theoretical understanding of the chemistry and
physics of small molecules. The present work introduces an algebraic topology
based method, called element specific persistent homology (ESPH), as a new
representation of small molecules that is entirely different from conventional
chemical and/or physical representations. ESPH describes molecular properties
in terms of multiscale and multicomponent topological invariants. Such
topological representation is systematical, comprehensive, and scalable with
respect to molecular size and composition variations. However, it cannot be
literally translated into a physical interpretation. Fortunately, it is readily
suitable for machine learning methods, rendering topological learning
algorithms. Due to the inherent correlation between solubility and partition
coefficient, a uniform ESPH representation is developed for both properties,
which facilitates multi-task deep neural networks for their simultaneous
predictions. This strategy leads to more accurate prediction of relatively
small data sets. A total of six data sets is considered in the present work to
validate the proposed topological and multi-task deep learning approaches. It
is demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve some of the most accurate
predictions of aqueous solubility and partition coefficient. Our software is
