computers and may be unnecessary because useful quantum circuits exhibit
significant structure that can be exploited during simulation. For example,
Gottesman and Knill identified an important subclass, called stabilizer
circuits, which can be simulated efficiently using group-theory techniques and
insights from quantum physics. Realistic circuits enriched with quantum
error-correcting codes and fault-tolerant procedures are dominated by
stabilizer subcircuits and contain a relatively small number of non-Clifford
components. Therefore, we develop new data structures and algorithms that
facilitate parallel simulation of such circuits. Stabilizer frames offer more
compact storage than previous approaches but require more sophisticated
bookkeeping. Our implementation, called Quipu, simulates certain quantum
arithmetic circuits (e.g., reversible ripple-carry adders) in polynomial time
and space for equal superpositions of $n$-qubits. On such instances, known
linear-algebraic simulation techniques, such as the (state-of-the-art)
BDD-based simulator QuIDDPro, take exponential time. We simulate quantum
Fourier transform and quantum fault-tolerant circuits using Quipu, and the
results demonstrate that our stabilizer-based technique empirically outperforms
QuIDDPro in all cases. While previous high-performance, structure-aware
simulations of quantum circuits were difficult to parallelize, we demonstrate
that Quipu can be parallelized with a nontrivial computational speedup.

molecular individualism, dynamic heterogeneity, and molecular sub-populations

dynamics has been extended to increasingly complex materials, including
architecturally complex polymers such as combs, bottlebrushes, and ring
polymers and entangled solutions of long chain polymers in flow. Single
molecule visualization, complemented by modeling and simulation techniques such
as Brownian dynamics and Monte Carlo methods, allow for unparalleled access to
the molecular-scale dynamics of polymeric materials. In this review, recent
progress in the field of single polymer dynamics is examined by highlighting
major developments and new physics to emerge from these techniques. The
molecular properties of DNA as a model polymer are examined, including the role
of flexibility, excluded volume interactions, and hydrodynamic interactions in
governing behavior. Recent developments in studying polymer dynamics in
time-dependent flows, new chemistries and new molecular topologies, and the
role of intermolecular interactions in concentrated solutions are considered.
Moreover, cutting-edge methods in simulation techniques are further reviewed as
an ideal complementary method to single polymer experiments. Future work aimed
at extending the field of single polymer dynamics to new materials promises to
uncover original and unexpected information regarding the flow dynamics of

matching, in which case they are called graph CNNs. Graph CNNs are attracting
increasing attention due to their effectiveness and efficiency. However, the
existing convolution approaches focus only on regular data forms and require
the transfer of the graph or key node neighborhoods of the graph into the same
fixed form. During this transfer process, structural information of the graph
can be lost, and some redundant information can be incorporated. To overcome
this problem, we propose the disordered graph convolutional neural network
(DGCNN) based on the mixed Gaussian model, which extends the CNN by adding a
preprocessing layer called the disordered graph convolutional layer (DGCL). The
DGCL uses a mixed Gaussian function to realize the mapping between the
convolution kernel and the nodes in the neighborhood of the graph. The output
of the DGCL is the input of the CNN. We further implement a
backward-propagation optimization process of the convolutional layer by which
we incorporate the feature-learning model of the irregular node neighborhood
structure into the network. Thereafter, the optimization of the convolution
kernel becomes part of the neural network learning process. The DGCNN can
accept arbitrary scaled and disordered neighborhood graph structures as the
receptive fields of CNNs, which reduces information loss during graph
transformation. Finally, we perform experiments on multiple standard graph
datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in graph classification and retrieval.

according to the structural information from a guidance, has been applied for
various tasks in geometry processing. Existing methods either rely on a static
guidance that may be inconsistent with the input and lead to unsatisfactory
results, or a dynamic guidance that is automatically updated but sensitive to
noises and outliers. Inspired by recent advances in image filtering, we propose
a new geometry filtering technique called static/dynamic filter, which utilizes
both static and dynamic guidances to achieve state-of-the-art results. The
proposed filter is based on a nonlinear optimization that enforces smoothness
of the signal while preserving variations that correspond to features of
certain scales. We develop an efficient iterative solver for the problem, which
unifies existing filters that are based on static or dynamic guidances. The
filter can be applied to mesh face normals followed by vertex position update,
to achieve scale-aware and feature-preserving filtering of mesh geometry. It
also works well for other types of signals defined on mesh surfaces, such as
texture colors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of

transport and is a major limiting factor of current fusion devices. Above a
critical value, the ion temperature gradient leads to the growth of a
microinstability -- the ion temperature gradient mode -- that often dominates
the ion energy transport. It has recently been discovered that energetic ions
generated by auxiliary heating may reduce the growth of this instability. By
applying the gyrokinetic formalism and performing linear simulations using the
local continuum gyrokinetic code GS2, we explore the linear physics of this
stabilising effect. In order to isolate important effects due to the presence
of fast ions, we make use of the flexibility of GS2 to change the plasma and
magnetic geometry parameters independently. We assess the possibility to
neglect magnetic geometry changes to simplify the analysis, by investigating
its contribution to the stabilising effect. For the cases studied we find that
the Shafranov shift and safety factor profile might have to be taken into
account. For fixed fast ion density and temperature a destabilising influence
of their density gradient is found, while the high fast ion temperature
gradient is stabilising, both as predicted by theoretical models. A large part
of the observed stabilisation comes from the fast ion contribution to the
plasma $\beta$. In addition, the effect of $\beta$ is enhanced because of the
large density and temperature gradients of the fast ions. We investigate the
role of hot ion mass and charge in order to evaluate the stabilisation of
different types of hot ions. Also the possibility of adjusting the electron and
ion profiles to account for the presence of fast ions without including them as
a kinetic species, is considered. Finally, quasi-linear theory is invoked for
linking linear results to saturated values of the nonlinear heat fluxes.

Here we show that these solids are clearly different from resonant bonding in
the pi-orbital systems of benzene and graphene. Instead, they exhibit a unique
mechanism between covalent and metallic bonding, which we call 'metavalent'
bonding. The materials are on the verge of electron delocalization, which
explains their exceptional property portfolio, and we therefore argue that they
represent 'incipient metals'. This yields deeper, fundamental insight into the
bonding nature of solid-state materials, and is expected to accelerate the

effective robust optimization of discrete black-box problems. ATM has important
applications to many real-world engineering problems (e.g., manufacturing
optimization, product design, molecular engineering), where the objective to
optimize is black-box and expensive, and the design space is inherently
discrete. One weakness of existing methods is that they are not robust: these
methods perform well under certain assumptions, but yield poor results when
such assumptions (which are difficult to verify in black-box problems) are
violated. ATM addresses this via the use of marginal tail means for
optimization, which combines both rank-based and model-based methods. The
trade-off between rank- and model-based optimization is tuned by first
identifying important main effects and interactions, then finding a good
compromise which best exploits additive structure. By adaptively tuning this
trade-off from data, ATM provides improved robust optimization over existing
methods, particularly in problems with (i) a large number of factors, (ii)
unordered factors, or (iii) experimental noise. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ATM in simulations and in two real-world engineering problems:
the first on robust parameter design of a circular piston, and the second on
product family design of a thermistor network.

steepness from early- to late-types. The morphologies appear to be linked with
the star formation rate surface density, the molecular depletion time, and the
orbital time, but they do not correlate with the molecular gas content of the

contains both processive and distributive components, termed the composite
system. Expanding on the methods of Bozeman and Morales, we preclude
oscillations in the MM approximation of the composite system. This implies the
lack of oscillations in the MM approximations of the processive and
distributive systems, shown previously, as well as in the MM approximation of

  equalities: a generalization of conservation laws","43 Pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many physics problems have $J(x)=L(x)E(x)+h(x)$, source $h(x)$, fields
$E$,$J$ satisfying differential constraints, symbolized by $E\in\cal
E$,$J\in\cal J$ where $\cal E$,$\cal J$ are orthogonal spaces. If $L(x)$ takes
values in certain nonlinear manifolds $\cal M$, and coercivity, boundedness
hold, then the Green's function satisfies exact identities. We also link
Green's functions of different problems. The analysis, based on the theory of
exact relations for composites, does not assume microscale variations in
$L(x)$, and allows for other equations, such as for waves in lossy media. For
bodies $\Omega$, in which $L(x)\in{\cal M}$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
satisfies boundary field equalities. These generalize the notion of
conservation laws: the constraints on the fields inside $\Omega$ give
identities satisfied by the boundary fields, and provide extra constraints on
the interior fields. A consequence is this: if a matrix valued field $Q(x)$
with $\nabla\cdot Q=0$ takes values in a set $\cal B$ (independent of $x$) that
lies on a nonlinear manifold, we find conditions on the manifold, and on $\cal
B$, that with appropriate conditions on the boundary fluxes $q(x)=n(x)\cdot
Q(x)$ (where $n(x)$ is the outwards normal to $\partial\Omega$) force $Q(x)$
within $\Omega$ to take values in a subspace $\cal D$. This forces $q(x)$ to
take values in $n(x)\cdot\cal D$. We find there are additional divergence free
fields inside $\Omega$ that in turn generate additional boundary field
equalities. There exist partial Null-Lagrangians, functionals $F(w,\nabla w)$
of a vector potential $w$ and its gradient, that act as null-Lagrangians when
$\nabla w$ is constrained for $x\in\Omega$ to take values in certain sets $\cal
A$, of appropriate non-linear manifolds, and when $w$ satisfies appropriate
boundary conditions. The extension to certain non-linear minimization problems
is also sketched.

between many-body states on different energy scales conserves phase coherence.

  Online 3D Wind Field Prediction in Complex Terrain",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, low-altitude fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are largely
limited to primitively follow user-defined waypoints. To allow fully-autonomous
remote missions in complex environments, real-time environment-aware navigation
is required both with respect to terrain and strong wind drafts. This paper
presents two relevant initial contributions: First, the literature's first-ever
3D wind field prediction method which can run in real time onboard a UAV is
presented. The approach retrieves low-resolution global weather data, and uses
potential flow theory to adjust the wind field such that terrain boundaries,
mass conservation, and the atmospheric stratification are observed. A
comparison with 1D LIDAR data shows an overall wind error reduction of 23% with
respect to the zero-wind assumption that is mostly used for UAV path planning
today. However, given that the vertical winds are not resolved accurately
enough further research is required and identified. Second, a sampling-based
path planner that considers the aircraft dynamics in non-uniform wind
iteratively via Dubins airplane paths is presented. Performance optimizations,
e.g. obstacle-aware sampling and fast 2.5D-map collision checks, render the
planner 50% faster than the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) implementation.
Test cases in Alpine terrain show that the wind-aware planning performs up to
50x less iterations than shortest-path planning and is thus slower in low
winds, but that it tends to deliver lower-cost paths in stronger winds. More
importantly, in contrast to the shortest-path planner, it always delivers
collision-free paths. Overall, our initial research demonstrates the
feasibility of 3D wind field prediction from a UAV and the advantages of
wind-aware planning. This paves the way for follow-up research on
fully-autonomous environment-aware navigation of UAVs in real-life missions and
complex terrain.

defined on manifolds of non-negative or probability measures. Using the duality
in optimal transport, we introduce and study the one-parameter family of
$L^{(\pm \alpha)}$-divergences. It includes the Bregman divergence
corresponding to the Euclidean quadratic cost, and the $L$-divergence
introduced by Pal and the author in connection with portfolio theory and a
logarithmic cost function. They admit natural generalizations of exponential
family that are closely related to the $\alpha$-family and $q$-exponential

potential functions are R\'{e}nyi divergences. Using this unified framework we
prove that the induced geometries are dually projectively flat with constant
sectional curvatures, and a generalized Pythagorean theorem holds true.
Conversely, we show that if a statistical manifold is dually projectively flat
with constant curvature $\pm \alpha$ with $\alpha > 0$, then it is locally
induced by an $L^{(\mp \alpha)}$-divergence. We define in this context a
canonical divergence which extends the one for dually flat manifolds.

been able to finely tune the interfacial spin-polarization by changing the
capping layer thickness and composition. The spin-polarization was found to be
highest at a critical capping thickness that depends on the Sr doping. We
explain the non-trivial magnetic profile by the combined effect of two
mechanisms. On one hand, the extra carriers supplied by the low-doped
manganites that tend to compensate the overdoped interface, favouring locally a
ferromagnetic double-exchange coupling. On the other hand, the evolution from a
tensile-strained structure of the inner layers to a compressed structure at the
surface that changes gradually the orbital occupation and hybridization of the
3d-Mn orbitals, being detrimental for the spin polarization. The finding of an
intrinsic spin-polarization at the A-site cation observed in XMCD measurements
reveals also the existence of a complex magnetic configuration at the

a microwave drive applied to the qubit gives rise to a Kerr resonator with
two-photon driving that enables us to efficiently engineer the quantum state of
the resonator such as generation of the Schrodinger cat states for
resonator-based universal quantum computation. Moreover, the presented
architecture is easily scalable for solving optimization problem mapped into
the Ising spin glass model, and thus served as a platform for quantum
annealing. Although various scalable architecture with superconducting qubits
have been proposed for realizing quantum annealer, the existing annealers are
currently limited to the coherent time of the qubits. Here, based on the
protocol for realizing two-photon driven Kerr resonator in three-dimensional
circuit QED (3D cQED), we propose a flexible and scalable hardware for
implementing quantum annealer that combines the advantage of the long coherence
times attainable in 3D cQED and the recently proposed resonator based
Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. In the proposed resonator based LHZ
annealer, each spin is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent state of
3D microwave superconducting resonator with opposite phase, and thus the
fully-connected Ising model is mapped onto the network of the resonator with
local tunable three-resonator interaction. This hardware architecture provides
a promising physical platform for realizing quantum annealer with improved
coherence.

to constrain the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like
size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine
the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO$_2$ degassing
large enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not
to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh
rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO$_2$ accumulation
and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with
initial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total CO$_2$ budgets
ranging from $\sim 10^{-2} -1$ times Earth's estimated CO$_2$ budget, can
maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for $\approx 1-5$
Gyrs; larger CO$_2$ budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller
budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates
favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO$_2$ outgassing longer. Thus,
the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a
long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model
is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal
evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some
first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at
which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of
initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet
heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.

place, by embedding a message into a digit object such as image without
introducing noticeable artifacts. A number of steganographic systems have been
developed in past years, most of which, however, are confined to the laboratory
conditions where the real-world use of steganography are rarely concerned. In
this paper, we introduce an alternative perspective to steganography. A
graph-theoretic model to steganography on social networks is presented to
analyze real-world steganographic scenarios. In the graph, steganographic
participants are corresponding to the vertices with meaningless unique
identifiers. Each edge allows the two vertices to communicate with each other
by any steganographic algorithm. Meanwhile, the edges are associated with
weights to quantize the corresponding communication risk (or say cost). The
optimization task is to minimize the overall risk, which is modeled as additive
over the social network. We analyze different scenarios on a social network,
and provide the suited solutions to the corresponding optimization tasks. We
prove that a multiplicative probabilistic graph is equivalent to an additive
weighted graph. From the viewpoint of an attacker, he may hope to detect
suspicious communication channels, the data encoder(s) and the data decoder(s).

for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations under the framework of
two-stage fourth-order temporal discretization and Hermite WENO (HWENO)
reconstruction. Due to the high-order gas evolution model, the GKS provides a
time dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface. This time
evolution solution can be used not only for the flux evaluation across a cell
interface and its time derivative, but also time accurate evolution solution at
a cell interface. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables
inside each control volume, the GKS can get the cell averaged slopes inside
each control volume as well through the differences of flow variables at the
cell interfaces. So, with the updated flow variables and their slopes inside
each cell, the HWENO reconstruction can be naturally implemented for the
compact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of next step. Therefore, a
compact higher-order GKS, such as the two-stages fourth-order compact scheme
can be constructed. This scheme is as robust as second-order one, but more
accurate solution can be obtained. In comparison with compact fourth-order DG
method, the current scheme has only two stages instead of four within each time
step for the fourth-order temporal accuracy, and the CFL number used here can
be on the order of $0.5$ instead of $0.11$ for the DG method. Through this
research, it concludes that the use of high-order time evolution model rather
than the first order Riemann solution is extremely important for the design of
robust, accurate, and efficient higher-order schemes for the compressible
flows.

physics input is required. Inspired by a recent work by Datta and Larkoski, we
study the classification of quark/gluon-initiated jets based on fully-connected
neural networks (FNNs), where expert-designed physical variables are taken as
input. FNNs are applied in two ways: trained separately on various narrow jet
transverse momentum $p_{TJ}$ bins; trained on a wide region of $p_{TJ} \in
[200,~1000]$ GeV. We find their performances are almost the same. The
performance is better when the $p_{TJ}$ is larger. Jet discrimination with FNN
is studied on both particle and detector level data. The results based on
particle level data are comparable with those from deep convolutional neural
networks, while the significance improvement characteristic (SIC) from detector
level data would at most decrease by $15\%$. We also test the performance of
FNNs with full set or subsets of jet observables as input features. The FNN
with one subset consisting of fourteen observables shows nearly no degradation
of performance. This indicates that these fourteen expert-designed observables

the low-energy excitations, mimicking Weyl fermions but with manifest violation
of the Lorentz invariance, which has intriguing quantum transport properties.
The magnetoconductivity of type-II Weyl semimetals is investigated numerically
based on lattice models in parallel electric and magnetic field. We show that
in the high-field regime, the sign of the magnetoconductivity of an
inversion-symmetry-breaking type-II Weyl semimetals depends on the direction of
the magnetic field, whereas in the weak field regime, positive
magnetoconductivity is always obtained regardless of magnetic field direction.
We find that the weak localization is sensitive to the spatial extent of
impurity potential. In time-reversal symmetry breaking type-II Weyl semimetals,
the system displays either positive or negative magnetoconductivity along the
direction of band tilting, owing to the associated effect of group velocity,
Berry curvature and the magnetic field.

effort to examine the relationship between community resilience and risk

variables. Utilizing the 2012 Gulf Coast Climate Change Survey merged with
historical hurricane data and community resilience indicators, we first apply a
spatial statistical model to construct a county level risk perception indicator
based on survey responses. Next, we employ regression to reveal the
relationship between contextual hurricane risk factors and community
resilience, on one hand, and county level perceptions of hurricane risks, on
the other. Results of this study are directly applicable in the policy making
domain as many hazard mitigation plans and adaptation policies are designed and
implemented at the county level. Specifically, two major findings stand out.
First, the contextual hurricane risks represented by peak height of storm surge
associated with the last hurricane landfall and land area exposed to historical
storm surge flooding positively affect county level risk perceptions. This
indicates that hurricanes another threat wind risks need to be clearly
communicated with the public and fully incorporated into hazard mitigation
plans and adaptation policies. Second, two components of community resilience
higher levels of economic resilience and community capital are found to lead to
heightened perceptions of hurricane risks, which suggests that concerted
efforts are needed to raise awareness of hurricane risks among counties with
less economic and community capitals.

the time inconsistency involved in this paper. We then derive the path

recover $\mathbf{x}_0$ when $\mu_\ell=0$. For example, this includes all even
link functions. We resolve this issue by proposing and analyzing an alternative
convex recovery method. In a nutshell, our method treats such link functions as
if they were linear in a lifted space of higher-dimension. Interestingly, our
error analysis captures the effect of both the nonlinearity and the problem's

memory, is mainly studied in the statistical physics domain and has been
reported to exist in natural language. Using a state-of-the-art method for such
analysis, long-range correlation is first shown to occur in long CHILDES data
sets. To understand why, Bayesian generative models of language, originally
proposed in the cognitive scientific domain, are investigated. Among
representative models, the Simon model was found to exhibit surprisingly good
long-range correlation, but not the Pitman-Yor model. Since the Simon model is
known not to correctly reflect the vocabulary growth of natural language, a
simple new model is devised as a conjunct of the Simon and Pitman-Yor models,
such that long-range correlation holds with a correct vocabulary growth rate.
The investigation overall suggests that uniform sampling is one cause of
long-range correlation and could thus have a relation with actual linguistic

the Standard Model particles through the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$

survey covers 9.2 deg$^{2}$ field in the $g$, $i$, and $NB515$ bands and shows
a clear red giant branch (RGB) of M31's halo stars and a pronounced red clump
(RC) feature. The spatial distribution of RC stars shows a prominent stream
feature, the North Western (NW) Stream, and a diffuse substructure in the south
part of our survey field. We estimate the distances based on the RC method and
obtain $(m-M)$ = 24.63$\pm 0.191$(random)$\pm0.057$(systematic) and 24.29$\pm
0.211$(random)$\pm0.057$(systematic) mag for the NW stream and diffuse
substructure, respectively, implying that the NW Stream is located behind M31,
whereas the diffuse substructure is located in front. We also estimate
line-of-sight distances along the NW Stream and find that the south part of the
stream is $\sim$20 kpc closer to us relative to the north part. The distance to
the NW Stream inferred from the isochrone fitting to the color-magnitude
diagram favors the RC-based distance, but the TRGB-based distance estimated for
$NB515$-selected RGB stars does not agree with it. The surface number density
distribution of RC stars across the NW Stream is found to be approximately
Gaussian with a FWHM of $\sim$25 arcmin (5.7 kpc), with a slight skew to the
south-west side. That along the NW Stream shows a complicated structure
including variations in number density and a significant gap in the stream.

ALMA, we analyze the star formation rate (SFR), gas content and kinematics in
SDP 81, a gravitationally-lensed star-forming galaxy at redshift 3. We estimate
the SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) in the brightest clump of
this galaxy to be $357^{+135}_{-85}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$,
over an area of $0.07\pm0.02\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$. Using the intensity-weighted
velocity of CO$\,$(5-4), we measure the turbulent velocity dispersion in the
plane-of-the-sky and find $\sigma_{\mathrm{v,turb}} =
37\pm5\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ for the star-forming clump, in good agreement with
previous estimates along the line of sight. Our measurements of gas surface
density, freefall time and turbulent Mach number reveal that the role of
turbulence is vital to explaining the observed SFR in this clump. While the
Kennicutt Schmidt (KS) relation predicts a SFR surface density of
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,KS}} = 52\pm17\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$,
the single-freefall model by Krumholz, Dekel and McKee (KDM) predicts
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,KDM}} = 106\pm37\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$.
In contrast, the multi-freefall (turbulence) model by Salim, Federrath and
Kewley (SFK) gives $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,SFK}} =
491^{+139}_{-194}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$. Although the SFK
relation overestimates the SFR in this clump (possibly due to the ignorance of
magnetic field), it provides the best prediction among the available models.
Finally, we compare the star formation and gas properties of this high-redshift
galaxy to local star-forming regions and find that the SFK relation provides
the best estimates of SFR in both local and high-redshift galaxies.

learning paradigm, which is bound by the number and the quality of the training
instances. Existing training data must be manually generated through a
combination of expert domain knowledge and extensive human involvement.
However, due to drastic efforts required in annotating text, the resultant
datasets are usually small, which severally affects the quality of the learned
model, making it hard to generalize. Our work develops an automatic approach
for generating training data for event extraction. Our approach allows us to
scale up event extraction training instances from thousands to hundreds of
thousands, and it does this at a much lower cost than a manual approach. We
achieve this by employing distant supervision to automatically create event
annotations from unlabelled text using existing structured knowledge bases or
tables.We then develop a neural network model with post inference to transfer
the knowledge extracted from structured knowledge bases to automatically
annotate typed events with corresponding arguments in text.We evaluate our
approach by using the knowledge extracted from Freebase to label texts from
Wikipedia articles. Experimental results show that our approach can generate a
large number of high quality training instances. We show that this large volume
of training data not only leads to a better event extractor, but also allows us
to detect multiple typed events.

Analysis of a large sample of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging data with high
spatial and temporal resolutions obtained from AIA/SDO suggests an inverse
power-law dependence of the damping length on the periodicity of slow waves
(i.e., the shorter period oscillations exhibit longer damping lengths), in
agreement with the previous case studies. Similar behavior is observed in both
plume and interplume regions studied in AIA 171 \AA\ and AIA 193 \AA\
passbands. It is found that the short-period (2--6 min) waves are relatively
more abundant than their long period (7--30 min) counterparts in contrast to
the general belief that the polar regions are dominated by the longer-period
slow waves. We also derived the slope of the power spectra ($\mathrm{\alpha}$,
the power-law index) statistically to better understand the characteristics of
turbulence present in the region. It is found that the $\mathrm{\alpha}$ values
and their distributions are similar in both plume and interplume structures
across the two AIA passbands. At the same time, the spread of these

modification of the gauge generator generating time reparametrization can
potentially lead to deformations or anomalies in the modified algebra of first
class constraints. When working with self-dual variables, it has already been
shown that, for spherically symmetric geometry coupled to a scalar field, the
holonomy-modified constraints do not generate any modifications to general
covariance, as one faces in the real variables formula- tion, and can thus
accommodate local degrees of freedom in such inhomogeneous models. In this
paper, we extend this result to Gowdy cosmologies in the self-dual Ashtekar

in midisuperspace models, as is required in the `improved dynamics' of LQG, is
possible in the self-dual formalism while being out of reach in the current
effective models suing real-valued Ashtekar-Barbero variables. Our results

Extending descriptive set theory and its effective counterpart to general
represented spaces, including non-countably-based spaces has been started in
[Pauly, de Brecht 2015].
  We study the spaces $\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N})$,
$\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N},2)$ and the Kleene-Kreisel spaces
$\mathbb{N}\langle\alpha\rangle$. We show that there is a $\Sigma^0_2$-subset
of $\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N})$ which is not Borel. We show that the
open subsets of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}}$ cannot be continuously
indexed by elements of $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$ or even
$\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}}$, and more generally that the open subsets
of $\mathbb{N}\langle\alpha\rangle$ cannot be continuously indexed by elements
of $\mathbb{N}\langle\alpha\rangle$. We also derive effective versions of these
results.
  These results give answers to recent open questions on the classification of
spaces in terms of their base-complexity, introduced in [de Brecht, Schr\""oder,
Selivanov 2016]. In order to obtain these results, we develop general
techniques which are refinements of Cantor's diagonal argument involving
multi-valued fixed-point free functions and that are interesting on their own

bandit, with fixed confidence, is studied in a sequential decision-making
scenario. Each arm's signal follows a distribution from a vector exponential
family. All arms have the same parameters except the odd arm. The actual
parameters of the odd and non-odd arms are unknown to the decision maker.
Further, the decision maker incurs a cost for switching from one arm to
another. This is a sequential decision making problem where the decision maker
gets only a limited view of the true state of nature at each stage, but can
control his view by choosing the arm to observe at each stage. Of interest are
policies that satisfy a given constraint on the probability of false detection.
An information-theoretic lower bound on the total cost (expected time for a
reliable decision plus total switching cost) is first identified, and a
variation on a sequential policy based on the generalised likelihood ratio
statistic is then studied. Thanks to the vector exponential family assumption,
the signal processing in this policy at each stage turns out to be very simple,
in that the associated conjugate prior enables easy updates of the posterior
distribution of the model parameters. The policy, with a suitable threshold, is
shown to satisfy the given constraint on the probability of false detection.
Further, the proposed policy is asymptotically optimal in terms of the total
cost among all policies that satisfy the constraint on the probability of false
detection.

motivated by the fact that the curvaton contribution to scalar perturbations
can reduce the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ so that chaotic inflation models with
a quadratic potential are made consistent with the experimental bound on $r$.
After confirming that the scenario evades the current bounds on $r$ and the
scalar perturbation spectral index $n_s$, we make a prediction on the local
non-Gaussianity in bispectrum, $f_{\rm NL}$, and one in trispectrum, $\tau_{\rm
NL}$. Remarkably, since the sneutrino decay widths are determined by the
neutrino Dirac Yukawa coupling, which can be estimated from the measured active
neutrino mass differences in the seesaw model, our scenario has a strong
predictive power about local non-Gaussianities, as they heavily depend on the
inflaton and curvaton decay rates. Using this fact, we can constrain the
sneutrino mass from the experimental bounds on $n_s$, $r$ and $f_{\rm NL}$.

shielding effect on the flux penetrating the vacuum vessel. This reduces the
magnitude of the loop voltage seen by the plasma as also delays its buildup.
Also the induced currents alter the null location of magnetic field. This will
have serious implications on the plasma breakdown and startup and corrective
measures may be required in case of an insufficient loop voltage or an improper
null. Further, the eddy currents distribution will be vital for the plasma
equilibrium and need to be considered while reconstructing the equilibrium.
Evolution of the toroidal eddy currents in SST-1 passive structures has been

the case when only the statistics of the channels are known at the transmitter

following: First, we introduce a framework to classify random fading channels

coupling, coupling, and copulas. The underlying spirit of all scheme is, we
obtain an equivalent channel by changing the joint distribution in such a way
that it now satisfies a certain information theoretic order while ensuring that
the marginal distributions of the channels to the different users are not
changed. The construction of this equivalent multi-user channel allows us to
directly make use of existing capacity results, which includes Gaussian
interference channels, Gaussian broadcast channels, and Gaussian wiretap
channels. We also extend the framework to channels with a specific memory
structure, namely, channels with finite-state, wherein the Markov fading
broadcast channel is discussed as a special case. Several practical examples
such as Rayleigh fading and Nakagami-\textit{m} fading illustrate the
applicability of the derived results.

quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature, offering an ideal platform to
study low-dimensional and topological physics. While recent research has
intensively focused on monolayer stanene, the quantum size effect in few-layer
stanene could profoundly change material properties, but remains unexplored. By
exploring the layer degree of freedom, we unexpectedly discover
superconductivity in few-layer stanene down to a bilayer grown on PbTe, while
bulk {\alpha}-tin is not superconductive. Through substrate engineering, we
further realize a transition from a single-band to a two-band superconductor
with a doubling of the transition temperature. In-situ angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) together with first-principles calculations
elucidate the corresponding band structure. Interestingly, the theory also
indicates the existence of a topologically nontrivial band. Our experimental
findings open up novel strategies for constructing two-dimensional topological
superconductors.

indices. Here we present a large comprehensive catalogue of 70 GRBs with
multi-wavelength optical transient data on which we perform a systematic study
to find the temporal evolution of color indices. We categorize them into two
samples based on how well the color indices are evaluated. The Golden sample
includes 25 bursts mostly observed by GROND, and the Silver sample includes 45
bursts observed by other telescopes. For the Golden sample, we find that 95\%
of the color indices do not vary over time. However, the color indices do vary
during short periods in most bursts. The observed variations are consistent
with effects of (i) the cooling frequency crossing the studied energy bands in
a wind medium (43\%) and in a constant density medium (30\%), (ii) early dust
extinction (12\%), (iii) transition from reverse shock to forward shock
emission (5\%), or (iv) an emergent supernova emission (10\%). We also study
the evolutionary properties of the mean color indices for different emission
episodes. We find that 86\% of the color indices in the 70 bursts show
constancy between consecutive ones. The color index variations occur mainly
during the late GRB-SN bump, the flare and early reversed-shock emission
components. We further perform a statistical analysis of various observational
properties and model parameters (spectral index $\beta_{o}^{\rm CI}$, electron
spectral indices $p^{\rm CI}$, etc.) using color indices. Overall, we conclude
that $\sim$ 90\% of colors are constant in time and can be accounted for by the
simplest external forward shock model, while the varying color indices call for
more detailed modeling.

recently pointed out that the mass tensor of the collective Bohr Hamiltonian
cannot be considered as a constant and should be taken as a function of the
collective coordinates. Method : The Davydov-Chaban Hamiltonian, describing the
collective motion of {\gamma}-rigid atomic nuclei, is modified by allowing the
mass to depend on the nuclear deformation. Moreover, the eigenvalue problem for
this Hamiltonian is solved for Davidson potential and {\gamma} = 30{\deg}
involving an Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM). The present model is
conventionally called Z(4)-DDM-D (Deformation Dependent Mass with Davidson
potential), in respect to the so called Z(4) model. Results : Exact analytical
expressions are derived for energy spectra and normalized wave functions, for
the present model. The obtained results show an overall agreement with the
experimental data for 108-116Pd, 128-132Xe, 136;138Ce and 190-198Pt and an
important improvement in respect to other models. Prediction of a new candidate
nucleus for triaxial symmetry is made. Conclusion : The dependence of the mass
on the deformation reduces the increase rate of the moment of inertia with
deformation, removing a main drawback of the model and leading to an improved
agreement with the corresponding experimental data.

the FSs at intermediate temperatures reveal emergence of the 3D topology at
much lower temperature than the structural & magnetic phase transition
temperature (170 K, for the sample under scrutiny). This leads to the
conclusion that the evolution of FS topology is not directly driven by the
structural transition. In addition, we discover the existence in ambient
conditions of energy bands related to the collapsed tetragonal (cT) phase.
These bands are distinctly resolved in the high-photon energy spectra
exhibiting strong Fe 3d character. They gradually move to higher binding
energies due to thermal compression with cooling, leading to the emergence of
3D topology in the Fermi surface. These results reveal the so-far hidden
existence of a cT phase in ambient conditions, which is argued to lead to
quantum fluctuations responsible for the exotic electronic properties in

Cyber-security researchers and government agencies attempt to detect and take
down botnets by playing the role of the cat. In this context, a lot of work has
been done towards reverse engineering certain variants of malware families as
well as understanding the network protocols of botnets to identify their
weaknesses (if any) and exploit them. While this is necessary, such an approach
offers the botmasters the ability to quickly counteract the defenders by simply
performing small changes in their arsenals.
  We attempt a different approach by actually taking the role of the Botmaster,
to eventually anticipate his behavior. That said, in this paper, we present a
novel computational trust mechanism for fully distributed botnets that allows
for a resilient and stealthy management of the infected machines (zombies). We
exploit the highly researched area of computational trust to create an
autonomous mechanism that ensures the avoidance of common botnet tracking
mechanisms such as sensors and crawlers. In our futuristic botnet, zombies are
both smart and cautious. They are cautious in the sense that they are careful
with whom they communicate with. Moreover, they are smart enough to learn from
their experiences and infer whether their fellow zombies are indeed who they
claim to be and not government agencies' spies. We study different
computational trust models, mainly based on Bayesian inference, to evaluate
their advantages and disadvantages in the context of a distributed botnet.
Furthermore, we show, via our experimental results, that our approach is
significantly stronger than any technique that has been seen in botnets to
date.

freedom is exited only in the strong curvature regime. We show that in the
framework of the ESTGB theories under consideration there exist new neutron

relativistic neutron stars. In contrast to the spontaneous scalarization in the
standard scalar-tensor theories which is induced by the presence of matter, in
our case the scalarization is induced by the spacetime curvature.

which is one of the main benefits of automated driving. Researchers have been
studying the planning of velocity trajectories, a simpler form of motion
planning, for over a decade now and many different methods are available.
Dynamic programming has shown to be the most common choice due to its numerical
background and ability to include nonlinear constraints and models. Although
planning of an optimal trajectory is done in a systematic way, dynamic
programming does not use any knowledge about the considered problem to guide
the exploration and therefore explores all possible trajectories.
  A* is a search algorithm which enables using knowledge about the problem to
guide the exploration to the most promising solutions first. Knowledge has to
be represented in a form of a heuristic function, which gives an optimistic
estimate of cost for transitioning to the final state, which is not a
straightforward task. This paper presents a novel heuristics incorporating air
drag and auxiliary power as well as operational costs of the vehicle, besides
kinetic and potential energy and rolling resistance known in the literature.
Furthermore, optimal cruising velocity, which depends on vehicle aerodynamic
properties and auxiliary power, is derived. Results are compared for different
variants of heuristic functions and dynamic programming as well.

unambiguously show that short PLL chains adsorb onto microgels and act as

that polyion-induced clustering is a quasi-reversible process: within the time

as the mixtures are cooled down. Finally we give a proof that the observed

Berry curvature terms contribute to the Josephson currents; we chart out
situations where such terms can have relatively large effects. For a system of
three $s$- or three $p$-wave superconductors, we provide analytic expressions
for the Andreev bound state energies and study the Josephson currents in
response to a constant voltage applied across one of the wires; we find that
the integrated transconductance at zero temperature is quantized to integer
multiples of $4e^2/h$, where $e$ is the electron charge and $h = 2\pi \hbar$ is
Planck's constant. For a sinusoidal current with frequency $\omega$ applied
across one of the wires in the junction, we find that Shapiro plateaus appear

rational fractional multiple (in contrast to only integer multiples in
junctions of two wires) of $2e \langle V_1 \rangle/(\hbar \omega)$. We also use

that the corresponding Andreev bound state energies depend on the spin of the

of evaluation, we identify aspects that hinder the CNNs' recognition, such as
artistic abstraction. Further, we test various domain adaptation methods that
could enhance the subject recognition capabilities of the CNNs. The evaluation
is performed on a database of 80,000 annotated digitized paintings, which is
tentatively extended with artistic photographs, either original or stylized, in
order to emulate artistic representations. Surprisingly, the most efficient
domain adaptation is not the neural style transfer. Finally, the paper provides
an experiment-based assessment of the abstraction level that CNNs are able to
achieve.

propagate them by integrating fully 3D trajectories within the inner
heliosphere in the presence of weak scattering. We model the HCS position using
fits based on neutral lines of magnetic field source surface maps (SSMs).
  We map 1 au proton crossings, which show efficient transport in longitude via
HCS, depending on the location of the injection region with respect to the HCS.
For HCS tilt angles around $30^\circ-40^\circ$, we find significant qualitative
differences between A+ and A$-$ configurations of the IMF, with stronger
fluences along the HCS in the former case but with a distribution of particles
across a wider range of longitudes and latitudes in the latter.
  We show how a wavy current sheet leads to longitudinally periodic
enhancements in particle fluence. We show that for an A+ IMF configuration, a
wavy HCS allows for more proton deceleration than a flat HCS. We find that A$-$
IMF configurations result in larger average fluences than A+ IMF
configurations, due to a radial drift component at the current sheet.

and photon radiations are included by adding the corresponding three-body decay

stays small in the total width but can vary up to -8% for the decay width into

surprisingly weak dependence on dPGS size (and bare charge) which can be
understood by colloidal charge-renormalization effects and by the fact that the

application. Recent advances in deep learning have also resulted in great

navigation depends on various expensive sensors or large amounts of real
labeled data which is difficult to acquire and sometimes erroneous. The
objective of this study is to train an autonomous navigation model that uses a
simulator (instead of real labeled data) and an inexpensive monocular camera.
In order to exploit the simulator satisfactorily, our proposed method is based
on domain adaptation with adversarial learning. Specifically, we propose our
model with 1) a dilated residual block in the generator, 2) cycle loss, and 3)
style loss to improve the adversarial learning performance for satisfactory
domain adaptation. In addition, we perform a theoretical analysis that supports
the justification of our proposed method. We present empirical results of
navigation in outdoor courses with various intersections using a commercial

them optimal codes in this paper) is a challenging task and has attracted great
attention in the last few years. Tamo and Barg \cite{TB14} first gave a
breakthrough result in this topic by cleverly considering subcodes of
Reed-Solomon codes. Thus, $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes from
subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes given in \cite{TB14} have length upper bounded
by $q$. Recently, it was shown through extension of construction in \cite{TB14}
that length of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes can be $q+1$ in
\cite{JMX17}. Surprisingly it was shown in \cite{BHHMV16} that, unlike
classical MDS codes, $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes could have length
bigger than $q+1$. Thus, it becomes an interesting and challenging problem to
construct $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of length bigger than $q+1$.
  In the present paper, we make use of rich algebraic structures of elliptic
curves to construct a family of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of
length up to $q+2\sqrt{q}$. It turns out that locality of our codes can be as
big as $23$ and distance can be linear in length.

  Efficiencies",,,"10.1109/TSP.2018.2847626",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper considers two possible approaches, which enable multiple pairs of
users to exchange information via multiple multi-antenna relays within one
time-slot to save the communication bandwidth in low-latency communications.
The first approach is to deploy full-duplexes for both users and relays to make
their simultaneous signal transmission and reception possible. In the second
approach the users use a fraction of a time slot to send their information to
the relays and the relays use the remaining complementary fraction of the time
slot to send the beamformed signals to the users. The inherent loop
self-interference in the duplexes and inter-full-duplexing-user interference in
the first approach are absent in the second approach. Under both these
approaches, the joint users' power allocation and relays' beamformers to either
optimize the users' exchange of information or maximize the energy-efficiency
subject to user quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of the exchanging information
throughput thresholds lead to complex nonconvex optimization problems.
Path-following algorithms are developed for their computational solutions. The
provided numerical examples show the advantages of the second approach over the
first approach.

  Resource","7 pages","IEEE GLOBECOM 2017",,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows multiple users to simultaneously
access the same time-frequency resource by using superposition coding and
successive interference cancellation (SIC). Thus far, most papers on NOMA have
focused on performance gain for one or sometimes two base stations. In this
paper, we study multi-cell NOMA and provide a general framework for user
clustering and power allocation, taking into account inter-cell interference,
for optimizing resource allocation of NOMA in multi-cell networks of arbitrary
topology. We provide a series of theoretical analysis, to algorithmically
enable optimization approaches. The resulting algorithmic notion is very
general. Namely, we prove that for any performance metric that monotonically
increases in the cells' resource consumption, we have convergence guarantee for
global optimum. We apply the framework with its algorithmic concept to a
multi-cell scenario to demonstrate the gain of NOMA in achieving significantly
higher efficiency.

are essential for elucidating the mechanism of physiochemical processes in
various scientific and practical fields, since the water is ubiquitous and
coats multifarious material surface under ambient conditions. By utilizing
periodic density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections,
herein we report for the first time the energetically and thermodynamically
favorable homolytic dissociative adsorption behavior of water over magnesia
(001) films deposited on metal substrate. The water adsorption on pristine
magnesia (001) is quite weak and the heterolytic dissociation is the only
fragmentation pathway, which is highly endothermic with large activation
barrier of 1.167 eV. The binding strength for the molecular and dissociative
adsorption configurations of water on hybrid MgO(001) films are significantly
larger than corresponding configurations on bare magnesia (001). The homolytic
dissociative adsorption energy of water on monolayer oxide is calculated to be
-1.192 eV, which is even larger than all the heterolytic dissociative
adsorption states. With the increase of the oxide thickness, the homolytic
dissociative adsorption energy decreases promptly, indicating the nanoscale of
oxide film play a crucial role in homolytic splitting of water. The homolytic
dissociative adsorption structure could be obtained by transformation reaction
from heterolytic dissociative adsorption structure, presenting activation
barriers 0.733, 1.103, 1.306, 1.571, and 1.849 eV for reactions on 1 ML to 5 ML
films. It is anticipated that the results here could provide inspiring clue and
versatile strategy for enhancing chemical reactivity and properties of
insulating oxide toward homolytic water splitting processes involved in novel

valuations as a function of the quantum dimension, and show that quantum
mechanics is not as contextual, by this metric, as other possible physical
theories. Attempts to find quantum mechanical scenarios that yield a high value
of this figure-of-merit can be thought of as generalisations or extensions of
the search for small Kochen-Specker sets. We also extend this result to

matrices are compared. For each pair, the comparison is made by applying an
affine transformation to one of them, which enables comparison whilst
preserving certain key properties such as normalised eigengaps. Bounds are
given on the eigenvalue differences thus found, which depend on the minimum and
maximum degree of the graph. The monotonicity of the bounds and the structure
of the graphs are related. The bounds on a real social network graph, and on
three model graphs, are illustrated and analysed. The methodology is extended
to provide bounds on normalised eigengap differences which again turn out to be
in terms of the graph's degree extremes. It is found that if the degree extreme
difference is large, different choices of representation matrix may give rise
to disparate inference drawn from graph signal processing algorithms; smaller
degree extreme differences result in consistent inference, whatever the choice
of representation matrix. The different inference drawn from signal processing
algorithms is visualised using the spectral clustering algorithm on the three

particles. The inflation is driven by two non-minimally coupled fields one
being the usual Higgs and the other one of the sterile scalars. It turns out
that in this model the tensor to scalar ratio and spectral index can match the
current data for a wide range of parameters.

transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CRE) and their energy loss mechanisms in
spiral galaxies. Until now, the radio scale height could only be determined for
a few edge-on galaxies because of missing sensitivity at high resolution.
  We developed a sophisticated method for the scale height determination of
edge-on galaxies. With this we determined the scale heights and radial scale
lengths for a sample of 13 galaxies from the CHANG-ES radio continuum survey in
two frequency bands.
  The sample average value for the radio scale heights of the halo are 1.1 +/-
0.3kpc in C-band and 1.4 +/- 0.7kpc in L-band. From the frequency dependence
analysis of the halo scale heights we found that the wind velocities (estimated
using the adiabatic loss time) are above the escape velocity. We found that the
halo scale heights increase linearly with the radio diameters. In order to
exclude the diameter dependence, we defined a normalized scale height which is
quite similar for all sample galaxies at both frequency bands and does not
depend on the star formation rate or the magnetic field strength. However, the
normalized scale height shows a tight anticorrelation with the mass surface
density.
  The sample galaxies with smaller scale lengths are more spherical in the
radio emission, while those with larger scale lengths are flatter. The radio
scale height depends mainly on the radio diameter of the galaxy. The sample
galaxies are consistent with an escape-dominated radio halo with convective
cosmic ray propagation, indicating that galactic winds are a widespread
phenomenon in spiral galaxies. While a higher star formation rate or star
formation surface density does not lead to a higher wind velocity, we
deceleration of CRE outflow, e.g. a lowering of the wind velocity from the
galactic disk.

Spotlight Presentation",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there have been increasing demands to construct compact deep
architectures to remove unnecessary redundancy and to improve the inference
speed. While many recent works focus on reducing the redundancy by eliminating
unneeded weight parameters, it is not possible to apply a single deep
architecture for multiple devices with different resources. When a new device
or circumstantial condition requires a new deep architecture, it is necessary
to construct and train a new network from scratch. In this work, we propose a
novel deep learning framework, called a nested sparse network, which exploits
an n-in-1-type nested structure in a neural network. A nested sparse network
consists of multiple levels of networks with a different sparsity ratio
associated with each level, and higher level networks share parameters with
lower level networks to enable stable nested learning. The proposed framework
realizes a resource-aware versatile architecture as the same network can meet
diverse resource requirements. Moreover, the proposed nested network can learn
different forms of knowledge in its internal networks at different levels,
enabling multiple tasks using a single network, such as coarse-to-fine
hierarchical classification. In order to train the proposed nested sparse
network, we propose efficient weight connection learning and channel and layer
scheduling strategies. We evaluate our network in multiple tasks, including
adaptive deep compression, knowledge distillation, and learning class
hierarchy, and demonstrate that nested sparse networks perform competitively,
but more efficiently, compared to existing methods.

  pages; Mainly in english",,,,"math.CO cs.DM math.QA math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main ideas developed in this habilitation thesis consist in endowing
combinatorial objects (words, permutations, trees, Young tableaux, etc.) with
operations in order to construct algebraic structures. This process allows, by
studying algebraically the structures thus obtained (changes of bases,
generating sets, presentations, morphisms, representations), to collect
combinatorial information about the underlying objects. The algebraic
structures the most encountered here are magmas, posets, associative algebras,
dendriform algebras, Hopf bialgebras, operads, and pros. This work explores the
aforementioned research direction and provides many constructions having the
particularity to build algebraic structures on combinatorial objects. We
develop for instance a functor from nonsymmetric colored operads to
nonsymmetric operads, from monoids to operads, from unitary magmas to
nonsymmetric operads, from finite posets to nonsymmetric operads, from stiff
pros to Hopf bialgebras, and from precompositions to nonsymmetric operads.
These constructions bring alternative ways to describe already known structures
and provide new ones, as for instance, some of the deformations of the
noncommutative Fa\`a di Bruno Hopf bialgebra of Foissy and a generalization of
the dendriform operad of Loday. We also use algebraic structures to obtain
enumerative results. In particular, nonsymmetric colored operads are promising
devices to define formal series generalizing the usual ones. These series come
with several products (for instance a pre-Lie product, an associative product,
and their Kleene stars) enriching the usual ones on classical power series.
This provides a framework and a toolbox to strike combinatorial questions in an
original way. The first two chapters pose the elementary notions of
combinatorics and algebraic combinatorics used here. The last ten chapters
contain our original research.

spectra. This is supposedly due to non-photospheric continuum radiated by hot
spots beneath the accretion shocks at stellar surface and/or chromospheric
emission lines radiated by the post-shocked gas. The amount of veiling is often
considered as a measure of the mass-accretion rate. We analysed high-resolution
photospheric spectra of accreting T Tauri stars LkHa 321, V1331 Cyg, and AS 353
A with the aim of clarifying the nature of the line-dependent veiling. Each of
these objects shows a highly veiled, strong emission line spectrum and powerful
wind features indicating high rates of accretion and mass loss. Equivalent
widths of hundreds of weak photospheric lines were measured in the observed
spectra and compared with those in synthetic spectra with the same spectral
type. We found that the veiling is strongly line-dependent: larger in stronger
photospheric lines and weak or absent in the weakest ones. No dependence of
veiling on excitation potential within 0 to 5 eV was found. Different physical
processes responsible for these unusual veiling effects are discussed in the
framework of the magnetospheric accretion model. The observed veiling has two
origins: 1) an abnormal structure of stellar atmosphere heated up by the
accreting matter, and 2) a non-photospheric continuum radiated by a hot spot
with temperature lower than 10000 K. The true level of the veiling continuum
can be derived by measuring the weakest photospheric lines with equivalent
widths down to $\approx$10 m\AA. A limited spectral resolution and/or low
signal-to-noise ratio results in overestimation of the veiling continuum. In
the three very active stars, the veiling continuum is a minor contributor to
the observed veiling, while the major contribution comes from the
line-dependent veiling.

experiments, it remains viscosity-dependent in state-of-the-art 3D direct

realistic parameter values leads to an underestimation of the magnetic energy
by several orders of magnitude. The origin of this discrepancy is that fully 3D
DNS cannot reach low enough values of the magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$. To
bypass this limitation and investigate dynamo saturation at very low $Pm$, we
focus on the vicinity of the dynamo threshold in a rapidly rotating flow: the
velocity field then depends on two spatial coordinates only, while the magnetic
field consists of a single Fourier mode in the third direction. We perform
numerical simulations of the resulting set of reduced equations for $Pm$ down
to $2\cdot 10^{-5}$. This parameter regime is currently out of reach to fully
3D DNS. We show that the magnetic energy transitions from a high-$Pm$ viscous
scaling regime to a low-$Pm$ turbulent scaling regime, the latter being
independent of viscosity. The transition to the turbulent saturation regime
occurs at a low value of the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm \simeq 10^{-3}$,
which explains why it has been overlooked by numerical studies so far.

effective vacuum expectation value during inflation, can give rise to large
particle masses during inflation and reheating, leading to temporary blocking
of the reheating process and a lower reheat temperature after inflation. We
study the effects on the multiple stages of reheating: resonant particle
production (preheating) as well as perturbative decays from coherent
oscillations of the inflaton field. Specifically, we study both the cases of
the inflaton coupling to Standard Model fermions through Yukawa interactions as
well as to Abelian gauge fields through a Chern-Simons term. We find that, in
the case of perturbative inflaton decay to SM fermions, reheating can be
delayed due to Higgs blocking and the reheat temperature can decrease by up to
an order of magnitude. In the case of gauge-reheating, Higgs-generated masses
of the gauge fields can suppress preheating even for large inflaton-gauge
couplings. In extreme cases, preheating can be shut down completely and must be
substituted by perturbative decay as the dominant reheating channel. Finally,
we discuss the distribution of reheat temperatures in different Hubble patches,
arising from the stochastic nature of the Higgs VEV during inflation and its
implications for the generation of both adiabatic and isocurvature
fluctuations.

Fano-resonant nanostructures has received growing interest due to their
promising potential for developing integrated and advanced next-generation
nanophotonic devices. In this study, going beyond conventional subwavelength
structures, we propose an optothermally functional hetero-metallodielectric
asymmetric eight-member octamer cluster composed of a central silicon nanodisk
and peripheral disks with a phase-change material (Ge2Sb2Te5). Using full
electromagnetic calculations, we show that in the amorphous phase of the
surrounding particles, the oligomer acts as an all-dielectric cluster, while in
the crystalline regime, the octamer turns into a hybrid metallodielectric
assembly. Exploiting the exquisite ability of supporting distinct Fano
lineshapes at different wavelengths depending on the phase of Ge2Sb2Te5, we
showed the generation of both second and third harmonics at amorphous and
crystalline phases of GST nanodisks, respectively with the produced harmonic
wavelengths of 425 nm and 317 nm, respectively. Our calculations for the
corresponding conversion efficiencies revealed significant enhancements as
{\eta}SHG=0.012% and {\eta}THG=0.0081% for SHG and THG, respectively. Such an
exquisite feature of multiresonant optothermally tunable cluster allows
generation of several higher-harmonics with distinct intensities using a single
system for future photonics applications.

For this purpose, the minimal value of the amplitude of the complex Kuramoto

on coupling strength varies due to sampling variations and correlates with the
sample kurtosis of the natural frequency distribution. The skewness of the
frequency sample determines the frequency of the resulting collective mode. The
effects of kurtosis and skewness hold in the thermodynamic limit of infinite
ensembles. We prove this by integrating a self-consistency equation for the
complex Kuramoto order parameter for two families of distributions with

many applications. Typical approaches to tackle this problem involve either the
training of deep networks on vast amounts of images to directly infer the
labels or the use of probabilistic graphical models to jointly model the
dependencies of the input (i.e. images) and output (i.e. labels). Yet, the
former approaches do not capture the structure of the output labels, which is
crucial for the performance of dense labeling, and the latter rely on carefully
hand-designed priors that require costly parameter tuning via optimization
techniques, which in turn leads to long inference times. To alleviate these
restrictions, we explore how to arrive at dense semantic pixel labels given
both the input image and an initial estimate of the output labels. We propose a
parallel architecture that: 1) exploits the context information through a
LabelPropagation network to propagate correct labels from nearby pixels to
improve the object boundaries, 2) uses a LabelReplacement network to directly
replace possibly erroneous, initial labels with new ones, and 3) combines the
different intermediate results via a Fusion network to obtain the final
per-pixel label. We experimentally validate our approach on two different
datasets for the semantic segmentation and face parsing tasks respectively,
where we show improvements over the state-of-the-art. We also provide both a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generated results.

dissipation range of turbulence. In this range the fluid velocity field varies
smoothly, and the relative velocity of two fluid particles depends linearly
upon their separation. While this may suggest that the rate at which fluid
particles separate is exponential in time, this is not guaranteed because the
strain-rate governing their separation is a strongly fluctuating quantity in
turbulence. Indeed, the recent paper by Afik \& Steinberg (Nat. Commun.
\textbf{8}: 468, 2017) argues that there is no convincing evidence that the
moments of the separation between fluid particles grow exponentially with time
in the dissipation range of turbulence. Motivated by this, we use Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS) to compute the moments of the particle separation
over very long periods of time to see if we ever see evidence for exponential
separation. Our results show that if the initial separation between the
particles is infinitesimal, the moments of the particle separation first grow
as power laws in time, but we then observe, for the first time, convincing
evidence that at sufficiently long times the moments do grow exponentially.
However, this exponential growth is only observed after extremely long times
$\gtrsim 200\tau_\eta$, where $\tau_\eta$ is the Kolmogorov timescale. This is
due to fluctuations in the strain-rate about its mean value measured along the
particle trajectories, the effect of which on the moments of the particle
separation persists for very long times. We also consider the Backward-in-Time
(BIT) moments of the particle separation, and observe that they too grow
exponentially in the long-time regime. However, a dramatic consequence of the
exponential separation is that at long-times the difference between..

attention in recent years. In particular, interfacing quantum-light sources,
gates and detectors on a single chip is highly desirable for the realization of
large networks. In this context, fabrication techniques that enable the
deterministic integration of pre-selected quantum-light emitters into
nanophotonic elements play a key role when moving forward to circuits
containing multiple emitters. Here, we present the deterministic integration of
an InAs quantum dot into a 50/50 multi-mode interference beamsplitter via
in-situ electron beam lithography. We demonstrate the combined emitter-gate
interface functionality by measuring triggered single-photon emission on-chip
with $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.13\pm 0.02$. Due to its high patterning resolution as well
as spectral and spatial control, in-situ electron beam lithography allows for
integration of pre-selected quantum emitters into complex photonic systems.
Being a scalable single-step approach, it paves the way towards multi-node,
fully integrated quantum photonic chips.

connect galaxy samples, selected by stellar mass, to their host dark matter

monotonic trends with redshift and stellar mass. Applying $\Lambda$CDM halo
mass accretion histories and cumulative abundance arguments for the evolution
of stellar mass content we propose pathways for the coevolution of dark matter

mass at which the ratio of stellar to halo mass is maximized is
$10^{12.5_{-0.08}^{+0.10}}$~M$_{\odot}$ at $z\sim2.5$. This peak halo mass is
here inferred for the first time from stellar mass-selected clustering

power-law rising light curve, with a slope of $t^{0.78}$, up to 93 days after
the merger. The latest X-ray detection at 109 days is also consistent with such
a temporal slope. Such a shallow rise behavior requires a mildly relativistic
outflow with a steep velocity gradient profile, so that slower material with
larger energy catches up with the decelerating ejecta and re-energizes it. It
has been suggested that this mildly relativistic outflow may represent a cocoon
of material. We suggest that the velocity gradient profile may form during the
stage that the cocoon is breaking out of the merger ejecta, resulted from shock
propagation down a density gradient. The cooling of the hot relativistic cocoon
material immediately after it breaks out should have produced soft X-ray to UV
radiation at tens of seconds to hours after the merger. The soft X-ray emission
has a luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\sim 10^{45}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$ over a period of
tens of seconds for a merger event like GW 170817. The UV emission shows a rise
initially and peaks at about a few hours with a luminosity of $L_{\rm UV}\sim
10^{42} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. The soft X-ray transients could be detected by
future wide-angle X-ray detectors, such as the Chinese mission Einstein Probe.
This soft X-ray/UV emission would serve as one of the earliest electromagnetic
counterparts of gravitation waves from double neutron star mergers and could
provide the earliest localization of the sources.

behavior of a membrane foam-based layer and its local microstructural
morphology is also investigated. To this regard, we first produce a set of foam
samples having the same density and the same monodisperse pore size but
different values of the closure rate of the windows separating the foam pores.
Then, the morphology of pore connectivity with membranes is measured directly
on SEM together binocular images. The obtained morphological information is
used to reconstruct the representative unit cell for computational performance.
The knowledge of the computational model of acoustic porous materials obtained
by a hybrid approach based on the scaling laws and the semi-phenomenological
JCAL model. For validation purpose, the numerical simulations are further
compared with the experimental data obtained from a set of three-microphone
tube tests, a very good agreement is observed. In acoustic terms, the obtained
results point out that for the given high porosity and cell size, we can
archive a high sound absorbing ability of based-foam layer by controlling the
membrane level at a range of 45-85$\%$. To elaborate these foams, a gelatin
concentration in a range of 14-18$\%$ should be used in the foam making
process. In addition, we can obtain for instance the peak and the average
values of acoustic absorption of a foam layer in a specific frequency range of
interest by varying its membrane content. Methodologically, our work proposes
(i) a systematic approach to characterize directly macroscopic properties from
the local microstructure, and (ii) a manufacturing technique that can be used

introduces a minimal length scale into the description of space-time. It
effectively changes the invariant measure of the phase space through a factor
$(1+\beta \mathbf{p}^2)^{-3}$ so that the equation of state for an electron gas
undergoes a significant modification from the ideal case. It has been shown in
the literature (Rashidi 2016) that the ideal Chandrasekhar limit ceases to
exist when the modified equation of state due to the generalized uncertainty is
taken into account. To assess the situation in a more complete fashion, we
analyze in detail the mass-radius relation of Newtonian white dwarfs whose
hydrostatic equilibria are governed by the equation of state of the degenerate
relativistic electron gas subjected to the generalized uncertainty principle.
As the constraint of minimal length imposes a severe restriction on the
availability of high momentum states, it is speculated that the central Fermi
momentum cannot have values arbitrarily higher than $p_{\rm
max}\sim\beta^{-1/2}$. When this restriction is imposed, it is found that the
system approaches limiting mass values higher than the Chandrasekhar mass upon
decreasing the parameter $\beta$ to a value given by a legitimate upper bound.
Instead, when the more realistic restriction due to inverse $\beta$-decay is
considered, it is found that the mass and radius approach the values close to
$1.45$ M$_{\odot}$ and $600$ km near the legitimate upper bound for the
parameter $\beta$. On the other hand, when $\beta$ is decreased sufficiently
from the legitimate upper bound, the mass and radius are found to be
approximately $1.46$ M$_{\odot}$ and $650$ km near the neutronization
threshold.

and a rigid flat taking into account pressurized fluid trapped in the
interface. A finite element model is formulated for a general problem of
trapped fluid for frictionless and frictional contact. Using this model we
investigate the evolution of the real contact area, maximal frictional traction
and global coefficient of friction under increasing external pressure. Elastic
and elasto-plastic material models, compressible and incompressible fluid
models and different geometrical characteristics of the wavy surface are used.
We show that in case of incompressible fluid, due to its pressurization, the
real contact area and the global coefficient of friction decrease monotonically
with the increasing external pressure. Ultimately the contact opens and the
fluid occupies the entire interface resulting in vanishing of static friction.
In case of compressible fluids with pressure-dependent bulk modulus, we
demonstrate a non-monotonous behaviour of the global coefficient of friction
due to a competition between non-linear evolution of the contact area and of
the fluid pressure. However, for realistic compressibility of solids and
fluids, contact-opening cannot be reached at realistic pressures. An asymptotic
analytical result for the trap-opening pressure is found and shown to be
independent of the surface slope if it is small. On the other hand, in case of
elastic-perfectly plastic materials, we again observe fluid permeation into the
contact interface. Finally, we study the distribution of frictional tractions
during the depletion of the contact area under increasing pressure. This
process leads to emergence of singularity-like peaks in the tangential
tractions (bounded by the Coulomb's limit) near the contact edges. We point out
the similarity between the processes of trap opening and interfacial crack...

investigated and new results are found out of this study. Firstly, we study
several questions concerning the intersection between two classes of
non-degenerate binary recurrence sequences and provide, whenever possible,
effective bounds on the largest member of this intersection. Our main study
concerns Diophantine equations of the form $\varphi(|au_n |)=|bv_m|,$ where
$\varphi$ is the Euler totient function, $\{u_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ and
$\{v_m\}_{m\geq 0}$ are two non-degenerate binary recurrence sequences and
$a,b$ some positive integers. More precisely, we study problems involving
members of the recurrent sequences being rep-digits, Lehmer numbers, whose
Euler's function remain in the same sequence. We particularly study the case
when $\{u_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ is the Fibonacci sequence $\{F_n\}_{n\geq 0}$, the
Lucas sequences $\{L_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ or the Pell sequence $\{P_n\}_{n\geq 0}$
and its companion $\{Q_n\}_{n\geq 0}$. Secondly, we look of Lehmer's conjecture
on some recurrence sequences. Recall that a composite number $N$ is said to be
Lehmer if $\varphi(N)\mid N-1$. We prove that there is no Lehmer number neither
in the Lucas sequence $\{L_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ nor in the Pell sequence
$\{P_n\}_{n\geq 0}$. The main tools used in this thesis are lower bounds for
linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers, the so-called Baker-Davenport
reduction method, continued fractions, elementary estimates from the theory of

  Principle to Electromagnetic Fields","8 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The principle of equivalence postulating that an acceleration is
indistinguishable from gravity by any experiment, is valid within families of
particles having the same passive gravitational to inertial mass ratio
$m_p/m_i$. Presently experimental observations indicate that we live in a
universe with one single family for which $m_p/m_i=1$, but if we consider the
imaginary case of a universe with several particle families having different
$m_p/m_i$, the principle of equivalence would still apply to each one of them.
On the basis of this generalized formulation of the equivalence principle,
which becomes relative to sets of particles, and that we designate as the
\textit{single-particle equivalence principle}, one demonstrates that inertial
frames can also be implemented for sets of electrically charged particles, with
the same charge-to-mass ratio $q/m_i$, accelerating in homogeneous electric and
/ or magnetic fields (by analogy with the case of particles in free fall in a
homogeneous gravitational field). Experimental evidences in support of the
proposed extension of the principle of equivalence to electric fields are
presented. These consist in the Witteborn-Fairbank experiment which revealed
that electrons do not fall in the Earth gravitational field, and the well know
fact that electric charges do not radiate either when in free fall in a
homogeneous gravitational field, or when being accelerated by a homogeneous
electric field. The London moment in rotating superconductors is also
supporting the proposed extension of the equivalence principle. Prospects for
the future exploration of the consequences of the proposed theoretical scheme
to unify electromagnetism with gravitation in the paradigm of curved

photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, and the European

Spectroscopic observations confirm DES16C2nm to be at z=1.998, and
spectroscopically similar to Gaia16apd (a SLSN-I at z=0.102), with a peak
absolute magnitude of U=-22.26$\pm$0.06. The high redshift of DES16C2nm
provides a unique opportunity to study the ultraviolet (UV) properties of
SLSNe-I. Combining DES16C2nm with ten similar events from the literature, we
show that there exists a homogeneous class of SLSNe-I in the UV (~2500A), with
peak luminosities in the (rest-frame) U band, and increasing absorption to
shorter wavelengths. There is no evidence that the mean photometric and
spectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z<1) and high redshift
(z>1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at <2000A,
possibly caused by the variations in temperature between events. No significant
correlations are observed between spectral line velocities and photometric
luminosity. Using these data, we estimate that SLSNe-I can be discovered to
z=3.8 by DES. While SLSNe-I are typically identified from their blue observed
colors at low redshift (z<1), we highlight that at z>2 these events appear
optically red, peaking in the observer-frame z-band. Such characteristics are
critical to identify these objects with future facilities such as the Large

imposed by high penetration of electric vehicles, neither to deal with the
increasing deployment of distributed Renewable Energy Sources. Distribution
System Operators (DSO) will increasingly rely on flexible Distributed Energy
Resources (flexible loads, controllable generation and storage) to keep the
grid stable and to ensure quality of supply. In order to properly integrate
demand-side flexibility, DSOs need new energy management architectures, capable
of fostering collaboration with wholesale market actors and pro-sumers. We
propose the creation of Virtual Distribution Grids (VDG) over a common physical
infrastructure , to cope with heterogeneity of resources and actors, and with
the increasing complexity of distribution grid management and related resources
allocation problems. Focusing on residential VDG, we propose an agent-based
hierarchical architecture for providing Demand-Side Management services through
a market-based approach, where households transact their surplus/lack of energy
and their flexibility with neighbours, aggregators, utilities and DSOs. For
implementing the overall solution, we consider fine-grained control of smart
homes based on Inter-net of Things technology. Homes seamlessly transact
self-enforcing smart contracts over a blockchain-based generic platform.
Finally, we extend the architecture to solve existing problems on smart home
control, beyond energy management.

  barrier give rise to similar entangled wave functions","Pedagogical illustration that a quantum moat is as effective a
  barrier as a wall, with a simple explanation (and calculation) of Herring's
  orthogonalized plane wave expansion + pseudo potential",,"10.1119/1.5019166",,"cond-mat.quant-gas physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The solution to a problem in quantum mechanics is generally a linear
superposition of states. The solutions for double well potentials epitomize
this property, and go even further than this: they can often be described by an
effective model whose low energy features can be described by two states ---
one in which the particle is on one side of the barrier, and a second where the
particle is on the other side. Then the ground state remains a linear
superposition of these two macroscopic-like states. In this paper we illustrate
that this property is achieved similarly with an attractive potential that
separates two regions of space, as opposed to the traditionally repulsive one.
In explaining how this comes about we revisit the concept of ""orthogonalized
plane waves,"" first discussed in 1940 to understand electronic band structure
in solids, along with the accompanying concept of a pseudopotential. We show
how these ideas manifest themselves in a simple double well potential, whose
""barrier"" consists of a moat instead of the conventional wall.

representations that are invariant to common transformations such as
translation, rotation, and small deformations. There are multiple hypotheses
regarding the source of translation invariance in CNNs. One idea is that
translation invariance is due to the increasing receptive field size of neurons
in successive convolution layers. Another possibility is that invariance is due
to the pooling operation. We develop a simple a tool, the
translation-sensitivity map, which we use to visualize and quantify the
translation-invariance of various architectures. We obtain the surprising
result that architectural choices such as the number of pooling layers and the
convolution filter size have only a secondary effect on the
translation-invariance of a network. Our analysis identifies training data
augmentation as the most important factor in obtaining translation-invariant
representations of images using convolutional neural networks.

  Theorem",,,,,"eess.SP cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The state-of-the-art automotive radars employ multidimensional discrete
Fourier transforms (DFT) in order to estimate various target parameters. The
DFT is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), at sample and
computational complexity of $O(N)$ and $O(N \log N)$, respectively, where $N$
is the number of samples in the signal space. We have recently proposed a
sparse Fourier transform based on the Fourier projection-slice theorem
(FPS-SFT), which applies to multidimensional signals that are sparse in the
frequency domain. FPS-SFT achieves sample complexity of $O(K)$ and
computational complexity of $O(K \log K)$ for a multidimensional, $K$-sparse
signal. While FPS-SFT considers the ideal scenario, i.e., exactly sparse data
that contains on-grid frequencies, in this paper, by extending FPS-SFT into a
robust version (RFPS-SFT), we emphasize on addressing noisy signals that
contain off-grid frequencies; such signals arise from radar applications. This
is achieved by employing a windowing technique and a voting-based frequency
decoding procedure; the former reduces the frequency leakage of the off-grid
frequencies below the noise level to preserve the sparsity of the signal, while
the latter significantly lowers the frequency localization error stemming from
the noise. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated both
theoretically and numerically.

  laser two-photon polymerization",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays three-dimensional (3D) printing has been widely used for producing
geometrically complex 3D structures from a broad range of materials such as
ceramics, metals, polymers, semiconductors, etc. Although it has been
demonstrated that a fabrication resolution as high as ~100 nm can be achieved
in 3D printing based on two photon polymerization (TPP), the end product size
of TPP is typically on millimeter scale limited by the short working distance
of high-numerical-aperture focal lens. Here we present a method based on
simultaneous spatiotemporal focusing (SSTF) of the femtosecond laser pulses
that enables to fabricate centimeter-scale 3D structures of fine features with
TPP. We also demonstrate an isotropic spatial resolution which can be
continuously tuned in the range of ~10 um and ~40 um by only varying the power
of femtosecond laser, making this technique extremely flexible and easy to
implement. We fabricate several Chinese guardian lions of a maximum height of
0.6 cm and a Terra Cotta Warrior of a height of 1.3 cm using this method.
