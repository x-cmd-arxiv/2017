such a source, where a specific transport line with adequate elements is used,
such as tunable high gradient quadrupoles for handling the divergence. An
innovative permanent magnet based quadrupole (QUAPEVA) made of two quadrupoles
superimposed capable of generating a gradient of 200 T/m is presented. The
first quadrupole consists of magnets shaped as a ring and attaining a constant
gradient of 155 T/m, and the second one made of four cylindrical magnets
surrounding the ring and capable of rotating around their axis to achieve a
gradient tunability of $\pm$ 46 T/m. Each tuning magnet is connected to a motor
and controlled independently, enabling the gradient to be tuned with a rather
good magnetic center stability ($\pm$10 $\mu$m) and without any field
asymmetry. The measurements and field optimization of seven quadrupoles with
different magnetic lengths are reported. A set of QUAPEVA triplet, installed at
COXINEL, achieved good focusing and enabled beam based alignment.

cancellation of one or more anomalous gauge abelian symmetries at the Planck

string theory. This suggests an analogy of the Green-Schwarz mechanism of
anomaly cancellation, at field theory level, which results in one or more
Stueckelberg pseudoscalars. In the case of a single Stueckelberg pseudoscalar
$b$, vacuum misalignments at phase transitions in the early Universe at the GUT
scale provide a small mass - due to instanton suppression of the periodic

""axi-Higgs"", which is a physical axion-like particle. The coupling of the
axi-Higgs to the gauge sector via Wess-Zumino terms is suppressed by the Planck

related to $M_{GUT}$. We build a gauged $E_6\times U(1)$ model with anomalous
$U(1)$. It contains both an automatic invisible QCD axion and an ultra-light
axi-Higgs. The invisible axion present in the model solves the strong CP
problem and has mass in the conventional range while the axi-Higgs, which can
act as dark matter, is sufficiently light ($10^{-22} \textrm{ eV} < m_{\chi} <

radial electric field that has been expected to cause accumulation of
impurities due to their high charge number. In this paper, two combined effects
that can potentially modify this scenario are discussed. First, it is shown
that, in low collisionality plasmas, the kinetic contribution of the electrons
to the radial electric field can make it negative but small, bringing the
plasma close to impurity temperature screening (i.e., to a situation in which
the ion temperature gradient is the main drive of impurity transport and causes
outward flux); in plasmas of very low collisionality, such as those of the
Large Helical Device displaying impurity hole, screening may actually occur.
Second, the component of the electric field that is tangent to the flux surface
(in other words, the variation of the electrostatic potential on the flux
surface), although smaller than the radial component, has recently been
suggested to be an additional relevant drive for radial impurity transport.
Here, it is explained that, especially when the radial electric field is small,
the tangential magnetic drift has to be kept in order to correctly compute the
tangential electric field, that can be larger than previously expected. This
can have a strong impact on impurity transport, as we illustrate by means of
simulations using the newly-developed code KNOSOS (KiNetic
Orbit-averaging-SOlver for Stellarators).

with a limiting curvature from a Hamiltonian point of view. We introduce a
parameterization of the phase space which allows us to describe fully the
Hamiltonian structure of the theory. We write down the equations of motion that
we solve in the regime deep inside the black hole, and we recover that the
black hole has no singularity, due to the limiting curvature mechanism. Then,
we study the relation between such black holes and effective polymer black
holes which have been introduced in the context of loop quantum gravity. As
expected, contrary to what happens in the cosmological sector, mimetic gravity
with a limiting curvature fails to reproduce the usual effective dynamics of
spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity which are generically not covariant.
Nonetheless, we exhibit a theory in the class of extended mimetic gravity whose
dynamics reproduces the general shape of the effective corrections of
spherically symmetric polymer models, but in an undeformed covariant manner.
These covariant effective corrections are found to be always metric dependent,
i.e. within the $\bar{\mu}$-scheme, underlying the importance of this
ingredient for inhomogeneous polymer models. In that respect, extended mimetic
gravity can be viewed as an effective covariant theory which naturally
implements a covariant notion of point wise holonomy-like corrections. The
difference between the mimetic and polymer Hamiltonian formulations provides us
with a guide to understand the deformation of covariance in inhomogeneous
polymer models.

other urban infrastructure networks (sanitary and storm-water sewers), which

functional topologies of all subnets of both infrastructure types resemble

mixed Pt-Fe (Fe-Pd and Fe-Rh) atomic chains suspended between Pt (Pd and Rh)

strong dependence of conductance spin-polarization on the applied gate

However, there is not a consensus on the
vortex definition in fluid dynamics. Lack of mathematical definition has caused
considerable confusions in visualizing and understanding the coherent vortical
structures in turbulence. According to previous study, it is realized that
vortex is not the vorticity tube and vorticity should be decomposed into a
rotational part which is the vortex vector and a non-rotational part which is
the shear. In this paper, several new concepts such as fluid rotation of local
point, the direction of fluid rotation axis and the strength of fluid rotation
are proposed by investigating the kinematics of fluid element in the 2D and 3D
flows. A definition of a new vector quantity called vortex vector is proposed
to describe the local fluid rotation. The direction of the vortex vector is
defined as the direction of local fluid rotation axis. The velocity components
in the plane orthogonal to the vortex vector have zero derivatives along the
vortex vector direction. The magnitude of the vortex vector is defined as the
rotational part of vorticity in the direction of the vortex vector, which is
the twice of the minimum angular velocity of fluid around the point among all
azimuth in the plane perpendicular to vortex vector. According to the
definition of the vortex vector, vortex is defined as a connected flow region
where the magnitude of the vortex vector at each point is larger than zero. The
new definition for the vortex vector and vortex follows three principles: 1.
Local in quantity, 2. Galilean invariant, 3. Unique. The definitions are
carefully checked by DNS and LES examples which clearly show that the new
defined vortex vector and vortex can fully represent the complex structures of
vortices in turbulence.

statistical sparsity, which is expressed as a limiting property of a sequence
of probability distributions. The limit is characterized by an exceedance
measure~$H$ and a rate parameter~$\rho > 0$, both of which are unrelated to
sample size. The definition is sufficient to encompass all sparsity models that
have been suggested in the signal-detection literature. Sparsity implies that
$\rho$~is small, and a sparse approximation is asymptotic in the rate
parameter, typically with error $o(\rho)$ in the sparse limit $\rho \to 0$. To
first order in sparsity, the sparse signal plus Gaussian noise convolution
depends on the signal distribution only through its rate parameter and
exceedance measure. This is one of several asymptotic approximations implied by
the definition, each of which is most conveniently expressed in terms of the
zeta-transformation of the exceedance measure. One implication is that two
sparse families having the same exceedance measure are inferentially
equivalent, and cannot be distinguished to first order. A converse implication
for methodological strategy is that it may be more fruitful to focus on the
exceedance measure, ignoring aspects of the signal distribution that have
negligible effect on observables and on inferences. From this point of view,
scale models and inverse-power measures seem particularly attractive.

individual-level detail that may be required in regions of low concentration or
small spatial scale. However, to simulate at such an individual-level
throughout a domain and in regions where concentrations are high can be
computationally expensive. Spatially-coupled hybrid methods provide a bridge,
allowing for multiple representations of the same species in one spatial domain

privacy for the scenario with noncolluding nodes. Protocol 1 requires a file
size that is exponential in the number of files in the system, while Protocol 2
requires a file size that is independent of the number of files and is hence
simpler. We prove that, for certain linear codes, Protocol 1 achieves the
maximum distance separable (MDS) PIR capacity, i.e., the maximum PIR rate (the
ratio of the amount of retrieved stored data per unit of downloaded data) for a
DSS that uses an MDS code to store any given (finite and infinite) number of
files, and Protocol 2 achieves the asymptotic MDS-PIR capacity (with infinitely
large number of files in the DSS). In particular, we provide a necessary and a
sufficient condition for a code to achieve the MDS-PIR capacity with Protocols
1 and 2 and prove that cyclic codes, Reed-Muller (RM) codes, and a class of
distance-optimal local reconstruction codes achieve both the finite MDS-PIR
capacity (i.e., with any given number of files) and the asymptotic MDS-PIR
capacity with Protocols 1 and 2, respectively. Furthermore, we present a third
protocol, Protocol 3, for the scenario with multiple colluding nodes, which can
be seen as an improvement of a protocol recently introduced by Freij-Hollanti
et al.. Similar to the noncolluding case, we provide a necessary and a
sufficient condition to achieve the maximum possible PIR rate of Protocol 3.
Moreover, we provide a particular class of codes that is suitable for this
protocol and show that RM codes achieve the maximum possible PIR rate for the
protocol. For all three protocols, we present an algorithm to optimize their
PIR rates.

training a Deep Network to predict a 3D pose from an image. The ability of
using synthetic images for training a Deep Network is extremely valuable as it
is easy to create a virtually infinite training set made of such images, while
capturing and annotating real images can be very cumbersome. However, synthetic
images do not resemble real images exactly, and using them for training can
result in suboptimal performance. It was recently shown that for exemplar-based
approaches, it is possible to learn a mapping from the exemplar representations
of real images to the exemplar representations of synthetic images. In this
paper, we show that this approach is more general, and that a network can also
be applied after the mapping to infer a 3D pose: At run time, given a real
image of the target object, we first compute the features for the image, map
them to the feature space of synthetic images, and finally use the resulting
features as input to another network which predicts the 3D pose. Since this
network can be trained very effectively by using synthetic images, it performs
very well in practice, and inference is faster and more accurate than with an
exemplar-based approach. We demonstrate our approach on the LINEMOD dataset for
3D object pose estimation from color images, and the NYU dataset for 3D hand
pose estimation from depth maps. We show that it allows us to outperform the

divide our non-dusty galaxy sample with rest-frame optical colours to isolate
red quiescent (`passive') galaxies. At each redshift, we identify a
characteristic stellar mass in the GSMF above which dusty galaxies dominate, or
are at least as important as non-dusty galaxies. Below that stellar mass,
non-dusty galaxies comprise about 80% of all sources, at all redshifts except
at $z=4-5$. The percentage of dusty galaxies at $z=4-5$ is unusually high:
30-40% for $M_{*}=10^9 - 10^{10.5} \, \rm M_\odot$ and $>80\%$ at $M_*>10^{11}
\, \rm M_\odot$, which indicates that dust obscuration is of major importance
in this cosmic period. The overall percentage of massive ($\log_{10}

redshift, reaching $>30\%$ at $z\sim2$. Instead, the quiescent percentage among
intermediate-mass galaxies (with $\log_{10} (M_*/M_\odot)=9.7-10.6$) stays

union of countably many countably compact spaces. These conditions involve very
elementary properties.
  Many results shown here are independent of the usual (ZFC) axioms of set
theory, and the consistency of some may involve large cardinals. For example,
it is independent of the ZFC axioms whether every locally compact,
$\omega_1$-compact space of cardinality $\aleph_1$ is $\sigma$-countably
compact. Whether $\aleph_1$ can be replaced with $\aleph_2$ is a difficult
unsolved problem. Modulo large cardinals, it is also ZFC-independent whether
every hereditarily normal, or every monotonically normal, locally compact,
$\omega_1$-compact space is $\sigma$-countably compact.
  As a result, it is also ZFC-independent whether there is a locally compact,
$\omega_1$-compact Dowker space of cardinality $\aleph_1$, or one that does not
contain both an uncountable closed discrete subspace and a copy of the ordinal
space $\omega_1$.
  Set theoretic tools used for the consistency results include the existence of
a Souslin tree, the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), and models generically referred
to as ``MM(S)[S]''. Most of the work is one by the $P$-Ideal Dichotomy (PID)
axiom, which holds in the latter two cases, and which requires no large
cardinal axioms when directly applied to topological spaces of cardinality
$\aleph_1$, as it is in several theorems.

currently one of the widely used methods for first-principles electronic
structure modeling of insulating transition metal oxides (TMOs). Since $U$ is
relatively large compared to band widths, the magnetic excitations in TMOs are
expected to be well described by a Heisenberg model. However, in practice the
calculated exchange parameters $J_{ij}$ depend on the magnetic configuration
from which they are extracted and on the functional used to compute them. In
this work we investigate how the spin polarization dependence of the underlying
exchange-correlation functional influences the calculated magnetic exchange
constants of TMOs. We perform a systematic study of the predictions of
calculations based on the local density approximation plus $U$ (LDA+$U$) and
the local spin density approximation plus $U$ (LSDA+$U$) for the electronic
structures, total energies and magnetic exchange interactions $J_{ij}$'s
extracted from ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations of
several transition metal oxide materials. We report that, for realistic choices
of Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ parameters, LSDA+$U$ and LDA+$U$ calculations
result in different values of the magnetic exchange constants and band gap. The
dependence of the band gap on the magnetic configuration is stronger in LDA+$U$
than in LSDA+$U$ and we argue that this is the main reason why the
configuration dependence of the $J_{ij}$'s is found to be systematically more
pronounced in LDA+$U$ than in LSDA+$U$ calculations. We report a very good
correspondence between the computed total energies and the parameterized
Heisenberg model for LDA+$U$ calculations, but not for LSDA+$U$, suggesting
that LDA+$U$ is a more appropriate method for estimating exchange interactions.

to move the disc without any external excitation. In a cycle, material +
intruder are sheared quasi-statically from $\gamma = 0$ to $\gamma_{max}$, and
then backwards to $\gamma = 0$. During various cycle phases, fragile and jammed

generated by shear reversals. $\delta$ per cycle, e.g. the quasistatic rate

$c \propto (\phi_c - \phi)^a$, with $a \simeq 3$ and $\phi_c \simeq \phi_J$,
reflecting the stiffening of granular systems under shear as $\phi \rightarrow

the collision constraints and the payoff. In the first game collision avoidance
is only considered by the follower, and each player maximizes their own

sequential maximization approach. Further, we show these actions, if feasible,
are also a Stackelberg and Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of our second

surrounded by Pulsar wind nebulae (PWN). The pulsar flux density were estimated
using the interferometric imaging technique of the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope at three frequencies 325 MHz, 610 MHz and 1280 MHz. The spectra
showed a turnover around gigahertz frequency in four out of six pulsars. It has
been suggested that the gigahertz peaked spectra (GPS) in pulsars arises due to
thermal absorption of the pulsar emission in surrounding medium like PWN, HII
regions, Supernova remnants, etc. The relatively high incidence of GPS
behaviour in pulsars surrounded by PWN impart further credence to this view.
The pulsar J1747$-$2958 associated with the well known Mouse nebula was also
observed in our sample and exhibited GPS behaviour. The pulsar was detected as
a point source in the high resolution images. However, the pulsed emission was
not seen in the phased array mode. It is possible that the pulsed emission was
affected by extreme scattering causing considerable smearing of the emission at
low radio frequencies. The GPS spectra were modeled using the thermal free-free
absorption and the estimated absorber properties were largely consistent with
PWN. The spatial resolution of the images made it unlikely that the point
source associated with J1747$-$2958 was the compact head of the PWN, but the
synchrotron self-absorption seen in such sources was a better fit to the
estimated spectral shape.

folding using a coarse-grained model. The extent of the impact of hydrodynamic
interactions, whether it accelerates, retards, or has no effect on protein
folding, has been controversial. Together with a theoretical framework of the
energy landscape theory (ELT) for protein folding that describes the dynamics
of the collective motion with a single reaction coordinate across a folding
barrier, we compared the kinetic effects of HI on the folding rates of two
protein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies: a
64-residue alpha/beta chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) protein, and a 57-residue
beta-barrel alpha-spectrin src-Homology 3 domain (SH3) protein. When comparing
the protein folding kinetics simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence
of HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the effect of HI on protein
folding appears to have a crossover behavior about the folding temperature.
Meaning that at a temperature greater than the folding temperature, the
enhanced friction from the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an
unfolded configuration results in lowered folding rate; conversely, at a
temperature lower than the folding temperature, HI accelerates folding by the
backflow of solvent toward the native folded state. Additionally, the extent of
acceleration depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI2,
where its folding nucleus is rather diffuse in a transition state, HI channels
the formation of contacts by favoring a major folding pathway in a complex free
energy landscape, thus accelerating folding. For a protein like SH3, where its
folding nucleus is already specific and less diffuse, HI matters less at a
temperature lower than the folding temperature. Our findings provide further
theoretical insight to protein folding kinetic experiments and simulations.

standard-luminosity Type IIP SNe. The ejected Nickel masses are 0.012+-0.010
and 0.015+-0.006 Msol for SN 2013K and SN 2013am, respectively. The physical
properties of the progenitors at the time of explosion are derived through
hydrodynamical modelling. Fitting the bolometric curves, the expansion velocity
and the temperature evolution, we infer total ejected masses of 12 and 11.5
Msol, pre-SN radii of ~460 and ~360 Rsol, and explosion energies of 0.34 foe
and 0.40 foe for SN 2013K and SN 2013am. Late time spectra are used to estimate
the progenitor masses from the strength of nebular emission lines, which turn
out to be consistent with red supergiant progenitors of ~15 Msol. For both SNe,
a low-energy explosion of a moderate-mass red supergiant star is therefore the
favoured scenario.

the particularities of a vortex ice system by direct observation of the vortex

range order, is observed at half matching field (H_{1}/2). Moreover, the vortex
ice state formed by the pinned vortices is still preserved at 2H_{1}/3. This
unexpected result is attributed to the introduction of interstitial vortices at
these magnetic field values. Although the interstitial vortices increase the
number of possible vortex configurations, it is clearly shown that the vortex
ice state observed at 2H_{1}/3 is less prone to defects than at $H_{1}/2$. In
addition, the non-monotonic variations of the vortex ice quality on the lattice
spacing indicates that a highly ordered vortex ice state cannot be attained by
simply reducing the lattice spacing. The optimal design to observe defect free
vortex ice is discussed based on the experimental statistics. The direct
observations of a tunable vortex ice state provides new opportunities to
explore the order-disorder transition in artificial ice systems.

the source controls the number of measurement updates, their transmission
times, and the amounts of energy used in their transmission (which govern their
delays, or service times, incurred). In the second setting, measurement updates
externally arrive over time, and therefore the number of updates becomes fixed,
at the expense of adding data causality constraints to the problem. We
characterize age-minimal policies in the two settings, and discuss the

become vital requirements for digital circuits and systems. However, the
enabling CMOS technology scaling has been facing significant challenges of
device uncertainties, such as process, voltage, and temperature variations. To
ensure system reliability, worst-case corner assumptions are usually made in
each design level. However, the over-pessimistic worst-case margin leads to
unnecessary power waste and performance loss as high as 2.2x. Since
optimizations are traditionally confined to each specific level, those safe
margins can hardly be properly exploited.
  To tackle the challenge, it is therefore advised in this Ph.D. thesis to
perform a cross-layer optimization for digital signal processing circuits and
systems, to achieve a global balance of power consumption and output quality.
  To conclude, the traditional over-pessimistic worst-case approach leads to
huge power waste. In contrast, the adaptive voltage scaling approach saves
power (25% for the CORDIC application) by providing a just-needed supply
voltage. The power saving is maximized (46% for CORDIC) when a more aggressive
voltage over-scaling scheme is applied. These sparsely occurred circuit errors
produced by aggressive voltage over-scaling are mitigated by higher level error
resilient designs. For functions like FFT and CORDIC, smart error mitigation
schemes were proposed to enhance reliability (soft-errors and timing-errors,
respectively). Applications like Massive MIMO systems are robust against lower
level errors, thanks to the intrinsically redundant antennas. This property
makes it applicable to embrace digital hardware that trades quality for power
savings.

investigate the very faint nature of this source through three approaches:
modelling the relativistic reflection spectrum to constrain the accretion
geometry, performing high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to search for an
outflow, and searching for the recently reported millisecond X-ray pulsations.
We find a strongly truncated accretion disk at $77^{+22}_{-18}$ gravitational
radii ($\sim 164$ km) assuming a high inclination, although a low inclination
and a disk extending to the neutron star cannot be excluded. The
high-resolution spectroscopy reveals evidence for oxygen-rich circumbinary
material, possibly resulting from a blueshifted, collisionally-ionised outflow.
Finally, we do not detect any pulsations. We discuss these results in the
broader context of possible explanations for the persistent faint nature of
weakly accreting neutron stars. The results are consistent with both an
ultra-compact binary orbit and a magnetically truncated accretion flow,
although both cannot be unambigiously inferred. We also discuss the nature of
the donor star and conclude that it is likely a CO or O-Ne-Mg white dwarf,
consistent with recent multi-wavelength modelling.

perpendicular or parallel to the disc. Mechanical jets drive the more powerful
outflows, exhibiting stronger mass and momentum coupling with the dense gas,
while radiation heats and rarifies the gas more. Radiation and perpendicular

is substantially different from previous analyses, as it does not rely on
direct estimates of star formation rate, but on the differential evolution of
the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF). We show the reliability of this
approach by means of semi-analytical and hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations. We then apply it to real data, using the SMFs derived in the
COSMOS and CANDELS fields. We find that the sSFR is proportional to
$(1+z)^{1.1\pm0.2}$ at $z>2$, in agreement with other observations but in
tension with the steeper evolution predicted by simulations from $z\sim4$ to 2.
We investigate the impact of several sources of observational bias, which
however cannot account for this discrepancy. Although the SMF of high-redshift
galaxies is still affected by significant errors, we show that future
large-area surveys will substantially reduce them, making our method an
effective tool to probe the massive end of the main sequence of star-forming

different opacities for two polarization modes of photons in the magnetized
atmosphere of neutron stars and the dielectric properties of the vacuum in
strong magnetic fields. In their previous study, Taverna et al. illustrated how
strong magnetic fields influence the behavior of the polarization observables
for radiation propagating in vacuo without addressing a precise, physical

polarization modes that can occur in the presence of an atmospheric layer above
the neutron star surface, computing the polarization angle and fraction and
systematically changing the magnetic field strength, radii of the emission
region, temperature, mass, and radii of the neutron stars. We confirmed that if

the temperature dependence of particle masses and vacuum expectation values. We
illustrate this point in three simple freeze-in models. The first one, which we
call kinematically induced freeze-in, is based on the observation that the
effective mass of a scalar temporarily becomes very small as the scalar
potential undergoes a second order phase transition. This opens dark matter
production channels that are otherwise forbidden. The second model we consider,
dubbed vev-induced freeze-in, is a fermionic Higgs portal scenario. Its scalar
sector is augmented compared to the Standard Model by an additional scalar
singlet, $S$, which couples to dark matter and temporarily acquires a vacuum
expectation value (a two-step phase transition or `vev flip-flop'). While
$\langle S \rangle \neq 0$, the modified coupling structure in the scalar
sector implies that dark matter production is significantly enhanced compared
to the $\langle S \rangle = 0$ phases realised at very early times and again
today. The third model, which we call mixing-induced freeze-in, is similar in
spirit, but here it is the mixing of dark sector fermions, induced by non-zero
$\langle S \rangle$, that temporarily boosts the dark matter production rate.
For all three scenarios, we carefully dissect the evolution of the dark sector
in the early Universe. We compute the DM relic abundance as a function of the
model parameters, emphasising the importance of thermal corrections and the
proper treatment of phase transitions in the calculation.

of the telescope spiders, these aberrations were recently diagnosed with
success on VLT/SPHERE, but so far no complete calibration has been performed to
overcome this issue. We propose closed-loop focal plane wavefront control based
on the asymmetric Fourier pupil wavefront sensor (APF-WFS) to calibrate these

aperture geometry in 8m class telescopes, we describe these aberrations as a
sum of the independent modes of piston, tip, and tilt that are distributed in
each quadrant of the telescope pupil. We calibrate these modes with the APF-WFS
before introducing our wavefront control for closed-loop operation. We perform
numerical simulations and then experimental tests on a real system using
Subaru/SCExAO to validate our control loop in the laboratory and on-sky.
Closed-loop operation with the APF-WFS enables the compensation for the IE in
simulations and in the laboratory for the small aberration regime. Based on a
calibration in the near infrared, we observe an improvement of the image
quality in the visible range on the SCExAO/VAMPIRES module with a relative
increase in the image Strehl ratio of 37%. Our first IE calibration paves the
way for maximizing the science operations of the current exoplanet imagers.
Such an approach and its results prove also very promising in light of the

the chemically defined thick disc population, while the metal-rich sample is
dominated by the thin disc. The AVR for the metal-poor sample shows an abrupt
increase at $\gtrsim7$\,Gyr, which is contributed by the thick disc component.
On the other hand, most of the thin disc stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]>-0.2}$\,dex
display a power-law like AVR with indices of about 0.3--0.4 and 0.5 for the

rounder velocity ellipsoid, i.e. $\sigma_\phi/\sigma_{\rm z}$ is close to 1.0,
probably due to the more efficient heating in vertical direction. Particularly
for the old metal-poor sample located with $|z|>270$\,pc, the vertical

$z=0$, with sizes primarily determined by the gas mass. For stars, we quantify
kinematics and morphology both via the fraction of stars on disk-like orbits
and with the radial extent of the stellar disk. In this mass range, stellar
morphology and kinematics are poorly correlated with the properties of the halo
available from dark matter-only simulations (halo merger history, spin, or
formation time). They more strongly correlate with the gaseous histories of the

develop well-ordered stellar disks. The best predictor of morphology we
identify is the spin of the gas in the halo at the time the galaxy formed 1/2
of its stars (i.e. the gas that builds the galaxy). High-$z$ mergers, before a
hot halo emerges, produce some of the most massive bulges in the sample (from
compact disks in gas-rich mergers), while later-forming bulges typically
originate from internal processes, as satellites are stripped of gas before the
galaxies merge. Moreover, most stars in $z=0$ MW-mass galaxies (even $z=0$

Satellite UFD hosts at $z=0 $ are identified based on four different abundance

describe the rotation curves of disk galaxies without the aid of dark matter.
Interpreting CG as a gauge natural theory yields conservation laws and their
associated superpotentials without ambiguities. We consider the light
deflection of a point-like lens and impose that the two Schwarzschild-like
metrics with and without the lens are identical at infinite distances from the
lens. The energy conservation law implies that the parameter $\gamma$ in the
linear term of the metric has to vanish, otherwise the two metrics are
physically inaccessible from each other. This linear term is responsible to
mimic the role of dark matter in disk galaxies and gravitational lensing
systems. Our analysis shows that removing the need of dark matter with CG thus
relies on a fine-tuning condition on $\gamma$. We also illustrate why the
results of previous investigations of gravitational lensing in CG largely
disagree. These discrepancies derive from the erroneous use of the deflection
angle definition adopted in General Relativity, where the vacuum solution is
asymptotically flat, unlike CG. In addition, the lens mass is identified with
various combinations of the metric parameters. However, these identifications
are arbitrary, because the mass is not a conformally invariant quantity, unlike
the conserved charge associated to the energy conservation law. Based on this
conservation law and by removing the fine-tuning condition on $\gamma$, i.e. by
setting $\gamma=0$, the energy difference between the metric with the
point-like lens and the metric without it defines a conformally invariant
quantity that can in principle be used for (1) a proper derivation of light
deflection in CG, and (2) the identification of the lens mass with a function
of the parameters $\beta$ and $k$ of the Schwarzschild-like metric.

pre-selection provides a method to determine which of the many possible input

Lastly, we use decision boundaries from the model to revise an already existing
method of classification, essentially asking the tree based method where
decision boundaries are best placed and defining a new classification method.
  We showcase these techniques by applying them to the problem of star-galaxy
separation using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (hereafter SDSS). We
use the output of MINT and the ensemble methods to demonstrate how more complex
decision boundaries improve star-galaxy classification accuracy over the
standard SDSS frames approach (reducing misclassifications by up to
$\approx33\%$). We then show how tree-interpreter can be used to explore how
relevant each photometric feature is when making a classification on an object

jets and central jet activity. First, precision analyses of the central jet
activity require full control of single top production in some analyses.
Second, the rate dependence on the size of the tagging jets is not limited to
weak boson fusion. For the first time, we show how subjet information on the
tagging jets and on the additional jet activity can be used to extract the
Higgs signal. The additional observables relieve some of the pressure on other,
critical observables. Finally, we compare the performance of weak boson fusion
and associated Higgs production.

of minimal hidden sector dark matter (DM) models, highlighting how the
cosmological history of these models informs the experimental signals. We study
simple ""secluded"" models, where the DM freezes out into unstable dark mediator
states, and consider the minimal cosmic history of this dark sector, where
coupling of the dark mediator to the SM was sufficient to keep the two sectors
in thermal equilibrium at early times. In the well-motivated case where the
dark mediators couple to the Standard Model (SM) via renormalizable
interactions, the requirement of thermal equilibrium provides a minimal,
UV-insensitive, and predictive cosmology for hidden sector dark matter. We call
DM that freezes out of a dark radiation bath in thermal equilibrium with the SM
a WIMP next door, and demonstrate that the parameter space for such WIMPs next
door is sharply defined, bounded, and in large part potentially accessible.
This parameter space, and the corresponding signals, depend on the leading
interaction between the SM and the dark mediator; we establish it for both
Higgs and vector portal interactions. In particular, there is a cosmological
lower bound on the portal coupling strength necessary to thermalize the two
sectors in the early universe. We determine this thermalization floor as a
function of equilibration temperature for the first time. We demonstrate that
direct detection experiments are currently probing this cosmological lower
bound in some regions of parameter space, while indirect detection signals and
terrestrial searches for the mediator cut further into the viable parameter
space. We present regions of interest for both direct detection and dark
mediator searches, including motivated parameter space for the direct detection
of sub-GeV DM.

dark matter particle could interact with a dark radiation component. If the
non-gravitational interactions of the dark matter and dark radiation species
with Standard Model particles are highly suppressed, then astrophysics and
cosmology could be our only windows into probing the dynamics of such a dark
sector. It is well known that such dark sectors would lead to suppression of
small scale structure, which would be constrained by measurements of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. In this work we consider the cosmological signatures of
such dark sectors on the reionization history of our universe. Working within
the ""ETHOS"" (effective theory of structure formation) framework, we show that
if such a dark sector exists in our universe, the suppression of low mass dark
matter halos would also reduce the total number of ionizing photons, thus
affecting the reionization history of our universe. We place constraints on the
interaction strengths within such dark sectors by using the measured value of
the optical depth from the Planck satellite, as well as from demanding a
successful reionization history. We compare and contrast such scenarios with
warm dark matter scenarios which also suppress structure formation on small
scales. In a model where dark matter interacts with a sterile neutrino, we find
a bound on the ETHOS parameter $a_4\lesssim 1.2\times10^6\textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$.
For warm dark matter models, we constrain the mass $m_{\textrm{WDM}}\gtrsim
0.7\textrm{ keV}$, which is comparable to bounds obtained from Lyman-$\alpha$
measurements. Future 21-cm experiments will measure the global history of
reionization and the neutral hydrogen power spectrum, which could either lead
to stronger constraints or discovery of secret dark sector interactions.

low-mass main-sequence stars, can be an effective probe to indirectly estimate
$N_{\rm{BH}}$ in a GC aided by calibrations from numerical models. Using
numerical models including all relevant physics we first show that
$N_{\rm{BH}}$ is strongly anticorrelated with $\Delta$ between giant stars and
low-mass main-sequence stars. We apply the distributions of $\Delta$ vs
$N_{\rm{BH}}$ obtained from models to three Milky Way GCs to predict the
$N_{\rm{BH}}$ retained by them at present. We calculate $\Delta$ using the

example we study three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals with electrons at a

dusty star-forming galaxies behind massive galaxy clusters benefits from strong
lensing, enhancing their measured emission while increasing spatial resolution.
Derived number counts depend, however, on mass reconstruction models that

of the number counts for a detailed treatment of the uncertainties in the
magnifications and adopted source redshifts. We find an overall agreement among
the number counts derived for the different lens models, despite their
systematic variations regarding source magnifications and effective areas. Our
number counts span ~2.5 dex in demagnified flux density, from several mJy down
to tens of uJy. Our number counts are consistent with recent estimates from
deep ALMA observations at a 3$\sigma$ level. Below $\approx$ 0.1 mJy, however,
our cumulative counts are lower by $\approx$ 1 dex, suggesting a flattening in
the number counts. In our deepest ALMA mosaic, we estimate number counts for
intrinsic flux densities $\approx$ 4 times fainter than the rms level. This
highlights the potential of probing the sub-10 uJy population in larger samples

  Wireless Signal Identification in Spectrum Monitoring applications","16 pages, journal",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents end-to-end learning from spectrum data - an umbrella term
for new sophisticated wireless signal identification approaches in spectrum
monitoring applications based on deep neural networks. End-to-end learning
allows to (i) automatically learn features directly from simple wireless signal
representations, without requiring design of hand-crafted expert features like
higher order cyclic moments, and (ii) train wireless signal classifiers in one
end-to-end step which eliminates the need for complex multi-stage machine
learning processing pipelines. The purpose of this article is to present the
conceptual framework of end-to-end learning for spectrum monitoring and
systematically introduce a generic methodology to easily design and implement
wireless signal classifiers. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of the
choice of wireless data representation to various spectrum monitoring tasks. In
particular, two case studies are elaborated (i) modulation recognition and (ii)
wireless technology interference detection. For each case study three
convolutional neural networks are evaluated for the following wireless signal
representations: temporal IQ data, the amplitude/phase representation and the
frequency domain representation. From our analysis we prove that the wireless
data representation impacts the accuracy depending on the specifics and
similarities of the wireless signals that need to be differentiated, with
different data representations resulting in accuracy variations of up to 29%.
Experimental results show that using the amplitude/phase representation for
recognizing modulation formats can lead to performance improvements up to 2%
and 12% for medium to high SNR compared to IQ and frequency domain data,
respectively. For the task of detecting interference, frequency domain
representation outperformed amplitude/phase and IQ data representation up to
20%.

agreement with observations. DLAs are more metal rich than LLSs, although the
metallicities in the LLS column density range (NHI = 10^17 -10^20 cm^-2) are
relatively flat, evolving from a median HI-weighted metallicity of Z<10^-2 Zsol
at z = 3 to ~10^-0.5 Zsol by z = 0. The metal content of HI systems tracks the
increasing stellar content of the Universe, holding ~5% of the integrated total
metals released from stars at z = 0. We also consider partial LLS (pLLS, NHI =
10^16-10^17 cm^-2) metallicities, and find good agreement with Wotta et al.

also find a large dispersion of pLLS metallicities, although we do not
reproduce the observed metallicity bimodality and instead we make the
prediction that a larger sample will yield more pLLSs around 0.1 Zsol. We
under-predict the median metallicity of strong LLSs, and predict a population
of Z < 10^-3 Zsol DLAs at z > 3 that are not observed, which may indicate more
widespread early enrichment in the real Universe compared to EAGLE.

dust grains could significantly alter the composition of the gas in the inner
disk. Our aim is to model the gaseous CO$_2$ abundance in the inner disk and
use this to probe the efficiency of icy dust transport in a viscous disk.
Features in the simulated CO$_2$ spectra are investigated for their dust flux
tracing potential. We have developed a 1D viscous disk model that includes gas
and grain motions as well as dust growth, sublimation and freeze-out and a
parametrisation of the CO$_2$ chemistry. The thermo-chemical code DALI was used
to model the mid-infrared spectrum of CO$_2$, as can be observed with
JWST-MIRI. CO$_2$ ice sublimating at the iceline increases the gaseous CO$_2$
abundance to levels equal to the CO$_2$ ice abundance of $\sim 10^{-5}$, which
is three orders of magnitude more than the gaseous CO$_2$ abundances of $\sim
10^{-8}$ observed by Spitzer. Grain growth and radial drift further increase
the gaseous CO$_2$ abundance. A CO$_2$ destruction rate of at least $10^{-11}$
s$^{-1}$ is needed to reconcile model prediction with observations. This rate
is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the fastest known chemical
destruction rate. A range of potential physical mechanisms to explain the low
observed CO$_2$ abundances are discussed. Transport processes in disks can have
profound effects on the abundances of species in the inner disk. The
discrepancy between our model and observations either suggests frequent shocks
in the inner 10 AU that destroy CO$_2$, or that the abundant midplane CO$_2$ is
hidden from our view by an optically thick column of low abundance CO$_2$ in to
the disk surface XDR/PDR. Other molecules, such as CH$_4$ or NH$_3$, can give
further handles on the rate of mass transport.

accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. Segmentation of brain
imagery into brain tissue and CSF (before and after surgery, i.e. pre-op vs.
postop) plays a crucial role in evaluating surgical treatment. Segmentation of
pre-op images is often a relatively straightforward problem and has been well
researched. However, segmenting post-operative (post-op) computational
tomographic (CT)-scans becomes more challenging due to distorted anatomy and
subdural hematoma collections pressing on the brain. Most intensity and feature
based segmentation methods fail to separate subdurals from brain and CSF as
subdural geometry varies greatly across different patients and their intensity
varies with time. We combat this problem by a learning approach that treats
segmentation as supervised classification at the pixel level, i.e. a training
set of CT scans with labeled pixel identities is employed. Methods: Our
contributions include: 1.) a dictionary learning framework that learns class
(segment) specific dictionaries that can efficiently represent test samples
from the same class while poorly represent corresponding samples from other
classes, 2.) quantification of associated computation and memory footprint, and
3.) a customized training and test procedure for segmenting post-op
hydrocephalic CT images. Results: Experiments performed on infant CT brain
images acquired from the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda reveal the success
of our method against the state-of-the-art alternatives. We also demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm is computationally less burdensome and exhibits a
graceful degradation against number of training samples, enhancing its
deployment potential.

of complexity imposed by the high-dimensional convolutions in convolutional

latency constraints, the high computational complexity of CNNs makes them
difficult to be exploited. Hardware solutions have striven to reduce the power
consumption using low-power techniques, and to limit the processing time by
increasing the number of processing elements (PEs). While most of ASIC designs
claim a peak performance of a few hundred giga operations per seconds, their
average performance is substantially lower when applied to state-of-the-art

Their performance efficiency is limited to less than 55% on average, which

we propose a dataflow which enables to perform both the fully-connected and

first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large
range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can
no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift
shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have
to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the
potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the
Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging
over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential
information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these
surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to
optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to
mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift
space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an
analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our

Banach space $\mathbb{X}$, the associated sequence
$(k_{m}[\mathcal{B}])_{m=1}^{\infty}$ of its conditionality constants verifies
the estimate $k_{m}[\mathcal{B}]=\mathcal{O}(\log m)$ and that if the reverse
inequality $\log m =\mathcal{O}(k_m[\mathcal{B}])$ holds then $\mathbb{X}$ is
non-superreflexive. However, in the existing literature one finds very few
instances of non-superreflexive spaces possessing quasi-greedy basis with
conditionality constants as large as possible. Our goal in this article is to
fill this gap. To that end we enhance and exploit a combination of techniques
developed independently, on the one hand by Garrig\'os and Wojtaszczyk in

learned in previous tasks (source task) to new tasks or new domains (target

performance of transfer learning models are: (a) the size of the target
dataset, and (b) the similarity in distribution between source and target
domains. Thus far, there has been little investigation into just how important
these factors are. In this paper, we investigate the impact of target dataset
size and source/target domain similarity on model performance through a series
of experiments. We find that more data is always beneficial, and model
performance improves linearly with the log of data size, until we are out of
data. As source/target domains differ, more data is required and fine tuning
will render better performance than feature extraction. When source/target
domains are similar and data size is small, fine tuning and feature extraction
renders equivalent performance. Our hope is that by beginning this quantitative
investigation on the effect of data volume and domain similarity in transfer
learning we might inspire others to explore the significance of data in
developing more accurate statistical models.

the generation of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). The origin
of this phenomenon is largely attributed to the interference of the incident
laser wave and surface electromagnetic wave that creates a periodic absorption
pattern. Although, commonly, LIPSS are produced by repetitive irradiation of
the same area by multiple laser pulses in the regime of surface melting and
resolidification, recent reports demonstrate the formation of LIPSS in the
single pulse irradiation regime at laser fluences well above the ablation
threshold. In this paper, we report results of a large-scale molecular dynamics
simulation aimed at providing insights into the mechanisms of single pulse
ablative LIPSS formation. The simulation performed for a Cr target reveals an
interplay of material removal and redistribution in the course of spatially
modulated ablation, leading to the transient formation of an elongated liquid
wall extending up to ~600 nm above the surface of the target at the locations
of the minima of the laser energy deposition. The upper part of the liquid wall
disintegrates into droplets while the base of the wall solidifies on the
timescale of ~2 ns, producing a ~100 nm-long frozen surface feature extending
above the level of the initial surface of the target. The properties of the
surface region of the target are modified by the presence of high densities of
dislocations and vacancies generated due to the rapid and highly nonequilibrium
nature of the melting and resolidification processes. The insights into the
LIPSS formation mechanisms may help in designing approaches for increasing the
processing speed and improving the quality of the laser-patterned periodic
surface structures.

~1150 - 10,000A. These were combined with Swift data to produce a UV/optical
""lag spectrum"", which shows the interband lag relative to the Swift UVW2 band
as a function of wavelength. The broad shape of the lag spectrum appears to
follow the $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relation seen previously in photometric
interband lag measurements of other active galactic nuclei (AGN). This shape is
consistent with the standard thin disk model but the magnitude of the lags
implies a disk that is a factor of ~3 larger than predicted, again consistent
with what has been previously seen in other AGN. In all cases these large disk
sizes, which are also implied by independent gravitational microlensing of
higher-mass AGN, cannot be simply reconciled with the standard model. However
the most striking feature in this higher resolution lag spectrum is a clear
excess around the 3646A Balmer jump. This strongly suggests that diffuse
emission from gas in the much larger broad-line region (BLR) must also
contribute significantly to the interband lags. While the relative
contributions of the disk and BLR cannot be uniquely determined in these
initial measurements, it is clear that both will need to be considered in
comprehensively modeling and understanding AGN lag spectra.

displacement interpolation where the interpolation is done on the optimal
transport map between the functions at nearby parameters, to achieve an
effective dimensionality reduction of hyperbolic phenomena. We further propose
a multi-dimensional extension by using the intertwining property of the Radon
transform. This extension is a generalization of the classical translational
representation of Lax-Philips [Lax and Philips, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 70

galaxies evolve across the age of the Universe. Their impact on supermassive
black hole growth and star formation is profound. The detailed study of dense
molecular gas in galaxies provides an important test of the validity of the
relation between star formation rate and HCN luminosity on different galactic
scales. We use observations of HCN, HCO+1-0 and CO3-2 to study the dense gas
properties in the Medusa merger. We calculate the brightness temperature ratios
and use them in conjunction with a non-LTE radiative line transfer model. The
HCN and HCO+1-0, and CO3-2 emission do not occupy the same structures as the
less dense gas associated with the lower-J CO emission. The only emission from
dense gas is detected in a 200pc region within the ""Eye of the Medusa"". No HCN
or HCO+ is detected for the extended starburst. The CO3-2/2-1 brightness
temperature ratio inside ""the Eye"" is ~2.5 - the highest ratio found so far.
The line ratios reveal an extreme, fragmented molecular cloud population inside
""the Eye"" with large temperatures (>300K) and high gas densities (>10^4 cm^-3).
""The Eye"" is found at an interface between a large-scale minor axis inflow and
the Medusa central region. The extreme conditions inside ""the Eye"" may be the
result of the radiative and mechanical feedback from a deeply embedded, young,
massive super star cluster, formed due to the gas pile-up at the intersection.
Alternatively, shocks from the inflowing gas may be strong enough to shock and
fragment the gas. For both scenarios, however, it appears that the HCN and HCO+
dense gas tracers are not probing star formation, but instead a post-starburst
and/or shocked ISM that is too hot and fragmented to form new stars. Thus,
caution is advised in linking the detection of emission from dense gas tracers
to evidence of ongoing or imminent star formation.

a strange attractor; conservative chaos, for which the entire phase space is a
large ""chaotic sea"" with randomly spaced elliptical islands inside it; and
mixed dynamics, characterized by the principal inseparability in the phase
space of attractors, repellers and conservative elements of dynamics. In the
present paper (which opens a cycle of three our papers), elements of the theory
of pseudo-hyperbolic attractors of multidimensional maps are presented. Such
attractors, as well as hyperbolic ones, are genuine strange attractors, but
they allow the existence of homoclinic tangencies. We give a mathematical
definition of a pseudo-hyperbolic attractor for the case of multidimensional
maps, from which we derive the necessary conditions for its existence in the
three-dimensional case, formulated using the Lyapunov exponents. We also
describe some phenomenological scenarios for the appearance of
pseudo-hyperbolic attractors of various types in one-parameter families of

with a realistically appearing but relativistic at origin simulation of a

that both conjectures are correct. On global scales, a universe with a positive

properties of any associated planets offers an observational link between
conditions during the epoch of planet formation and mature planetary systems.
We explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler target
stars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After
correcting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number
of planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity $M$. Planet occurrence
correlates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital
periods. For warm super-Earths having $P = 10-100$ days and $R_P =
1.0-1.7~R_E$, planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning
$-$0.4 dex to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless
of metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ($R_P =
1.7-4.0~R_E$) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40
planets per 100 stars. We model the distribution of planets as $d f \propto
10^{\beta M} d M$, where $\beta$ characterizes the strength of any metallicity
correlation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and
increasing planet size. For warm super-Earths $\beta = -0.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$,
while for hot Jupiters $\beta = +3.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. High metallicities in
protoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the
speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger
than 1.7 $R_E$. The association between high metallicity and short-period
planets may reflect disk density profiles that facilitate the inward migration
of solids or higher rates of planet-planet scattering.

points that does not cross more than $k$ different obstacles? This is a
fundamental problem that has undergone a tremendous amount of work. It is known
to be NP-hard, even when the obstacles are very simple geometric shapes (e.g.,
unit-length line segments). The problem can be generalized into the following
graph problem: Given a planar graph $G$ whose vertices are colored by color
sets, two designated vertices $s, t \in V(G)$, and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, is there
an $s$-$t$ path in $G$ that uses at most $k$ colors? If each obstacle is
connected, the resulting graph satisfies the color-connectivity property,
namely that each color induces a connected subgraph.
  We study the complexity and design algorithms for the above graph problem
with an eye on its geometric applications. We prove that without the
color-connectivity property, the problem is W[SAT]-hard parameterized by $k$. A
corollary of this result is that, unless W[2] $=$ FPT, the problem cannot be
approximated in FPT time to within a factor that is a function of $k$. By
describing a generic plane embedding of the graph instances, we show that our
hardness results translate to the geometric instances of the problem.
  We then focus on graphs satisfying the color-connectivity property. By
exploiting the planarity of the graph and the connectivity of the colors, we
develop topological results to ""represent"" the valid $s$-$t$ paths containing
subsets of colors from any vertex $v$. We employ these results to design an FPT
algorithm for the problem parameterized by both $k$ and the treewidth of the
graph, and extend this result to obtain an FPT algorithm for the
parameterization by both $k$ and the length of the path. The latter result
directly implies previous FPT results for various obstacle shapes, such as unit
disks and fat regions.

results suggest that stellar feedback in star forming galaxies reaches an
approximately steady state condition, in which a relatively constant fraction
of about 2% of the total energy output from supernovae and stellar winds is
converted into X-ray flux. Three late-stage merger remnants with low SFRs and
high K band luminosities (L(K)) have enhanced L(X)(gas)/SFR; their

lower L(X)(gas)/SFR ratios than the other galaxies in our sample, perhaps due

potentially leading to a large-scale cascading failure. Here we derive a
continuous model to advance our understanding of cascading failures in
power-grid networks. The model accounts for both the failure of transmission
lines and the desynchronization of power generators, and incorporates the
transient dynamics between successive steps of the cascade. In this framework,
we show that a cascade event is a phase-space transition from an equilibrium
state with high energy to an equilibrium state with lower energy, which can be
suitably described in closed form using a global Hamiltonian-like function.
From this function we show that a perturbed system cannot always reach the
equilibrium state predicted by quasi-steady-state cascade models, which would
correspond to a reduced number of failures, and may instead undergo a larger
cascade. We also show that in the presence of two or more perturbations, the
outcome depends strongly on the order and timing of the individual
perturbations. These results offer new insights into the current understanding
of cascading dynamics, with potential implications for control interventions.

extremes of regularity and randomness. We use analytical tools to derive
theoretical upper and lower bounds for the information propagation speed in an
urban delay tolerant network (i.e., a network that is disconnected at all time,
and thus uses a store-carry-and-forward routing model). We prove that the
average broadcast time behaves as $n^{1-\delta}$ times a slowly varying
function, where $\delta$ depends on the precise fractal dimension.
  Furthermore, we show that the broadcast speedup is due in part to an
interesting self-similar phenomenon, that we denote as {\em information
teleportation}. This phenomenon arises as a consequence of the topology of the
vehicle traffic, and triggers an acceleration of the broadcast time. We show
that our model fits real cities where open traffic data sets are available. We
present simulations confirming the validity of the bounds in multiple realistic

instability occurs when the intensity of the incident far-ultraviolet field
$G_0$ and gas density $n$ are high. For example, we have $3\times10^3<G_0<10^6$

$\xi_{\rm C}$ and $\xi_{\rm O}$ abundances and line opacities. We also give
examples of observed PDRs where instability could occur. For these PDRs, the
characteristic perturbation growth time is $t_{\rm inst}\sim10^3$ -- $10^4$ yr

$L\sim10^{-3}$ -- $5\times10^{-2}$ pc. For objects that are older than $t_{\rm

the expected exponential increase in data traffic in 5G networks. mmWave
networks typically require a very dense deployment of mmWave base stations
(mmBS). To reduce cost and increase flexibility, wireless backhauling is needed
to connect the mmBSs. The characteristics of mmWave communication, and
specifically its high directional- ity, imply new requirements for efficient
routing and scheduling paradigms. We propose an efficient scheduling method,
so-called schedule-oriented optimization, based on matching theory that
optimizes QoS metrics jointly with routing. It is capable of solving any
scheduling problem that can be formulated as a linear program whose variables
are link times and QoS metrics. As an example of the schedule-oriented
optimization, we show the optimal solution of the maximum throughput fair
scheduling (MTFS). Practically, the optimal scheduling can be obtained even for
networks with over 200 mmBSs. To further increase the runtime performance, we
propose an efficient edge-coloring based approximation algorithm with provable
performance bound. It achieves over 80% of the optimal max-min throughput and
runs 5 to 100 times faster than the optimal algorithm in practice. Finally, we
extend the optimal and approximation algorithms for the cases of multi-RF-chain
mmBSs and integrated backhaul and access networks.

Solymosi and Vu to gain $$ |B_{k,k}(E)| \gtrapprox
|E|^{\frac{13}{14}\gamma_k}.$$ For a general partition, let $\gamma_i =
\frac{2}{p_i}-\frac{2}{p_i(p_i+2)}$ and $\eta_i = \frac{2}{2d-(p_i-1)}$. Then
if $E$ is $s$-adaptable with $s>d-\frac{p_1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}$ we have $$ B_p(E)

subtasks, and test items should be designed to elicit students' justifications
for choosing particular modeling pathways. In addition to discussing these and
other implications for assessment, we also identify future areas of research

  We first construct a complete summary of the evolution of clusters in a given
time-varying network over a set of entities $X$ of which takes the form of a
formigram. This formigram can be understood as a certain Reeb graph
$\mathcal{R}$ which is labeled by subsets of $X$. By applying M\""obius
inversion to the formigram in two different manners, we obtain two dual notions

consists of time intervals annotated by their corresponding maximal groups -- a
notion due to Buchin et al., implying that we recognize the notion of maximal
groups as a special instance of generalized persistence diagram by Patel. On
the other hand, the persistence clustergram is mostly obtained by annotating
the intervals in the zigzag barcode of the Reeb graph $\mathcal{R}$ with
certain merging/disbanding events in the given time-varying network.
  We show that both diagrams are complete invariants of formigrams (or
equivalently of trajectory grouping structure by Buchin et al.) and thus
contain more information than the Reeb graph $\mathcal{R}$.

shown to allow efficient exploration. Despite its initial promising results, a
couple of issues in current algorithms limit its application, namely: (1) EO
methods require two separate steps (eigenoption discovery and reward
maximization) to learn a control policy, which can incur a significant amount
of storage and computation; (2) EOs are only defined for problems with discrete

  exoplanets around different stellar types","Accepted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aaa132",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the discovery of ever smaller and colder exoplanets, terrestrial worlds
with hazy atmospheres must be increasingly considered. Our Solar System's Titan
is a prototypical hazy planet, whose atmosphere may be representative of a
large number of planets in our Galaxy. As a step towards characterizing such
worlds, we present simulations of exoplanets that resemble Titan, but orbit
three different stellar hosts: G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We use general
circulation and photochemistry models to explore the circulation and chemistry
of these Titan-like planets under varying stellar spectra, in all cases
assuming a Titan-like insolation. Due to the strong absorption of visible light
by atmospheric haze, the redder radiation accompanying later stellar types
produces more isothermal stratospheres, stronger meridional temperature
gradients at mbar pressures, and deeper and stronger zonal winds. In all cases,
the planets' atmospheres are strongly superrotating, but meridional circulation
cells are weaker aloft under redder starlight. The photochemistry of
hydrocarbon and nitrile species varies with stellar spectra, with variations in
the FUV/NUV flux ratio playing an important role. Our results tentatively
suggest that column haze production rates could be similar under all three
hosts, implying that planets around many different stars could have similar
characteristics to Titan's atmosphere. Lastly, we present theoretical emission
spectra. Overall, our study indicates that, despite important and subtle
differences, the circulation and chemistry of Titan-like exoplanets are
relatively insensitive to differences in host star. These findings may be
further probed with future space-based facilities, like WFIRST, LUVOIR, HabEx,
and OST.

all phase space coordinates within a heliocentric distance of $\sim 10$ kpc. We
devise a method to assess the significance of halo substructures based on their
clustering in velocity space. The two most substantial structures are multiple
wraps of a stream which has undergone considerable phase mixing (S1, with 94
members) and a kinematically cold stream (S2, with 61 members). The member
stars of S1 have a median position of ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.12, -0.22, 2.75$) kpc and
a median metallicity of [Fe/H] $= -1.78$. The stars of S2 have median
coordinates ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.66, 0.30, 0.77$) kpc and a median metallicity of
[Fe/H] $= -1.91$. They lie in velocity space close to some of the stars in the
stream reported by Helmi et al. (1999). By modelling, we estimate that both
structures had progenitors with virial masses $\approx 10^{10} M_\odot$ and
infall times $\gtrsim 9$ Gyr ago. Using abundance matching, these correspond to
stellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^7 M_\odot$. These are somewhat larger
than the masses inferred through the mass-metallicity relation by factors of 5
to 15. Additionally, we identify two further substructures (S3 and S4 with 55
and 40 members) and two clusters or moving groups (C1 and C2 with 24 and 12)
members. In all 6 cases, clustering in kinematics is found to correspond to
clustering in both configuration space and metallicity, adding credence to the
reliability of our detections.

the possibility of realistically reproducing precipitation and weather events

However, these increased model resolutions both allow and require increasingly
complex diagnostics for evaluating model fidelity. In this study we use a suite
of dynamically downscaled simulations of the summertime U.S. (WRF driven by
NCEP) with systematic variations in parameters and treatment of convection as a
test case for evaluation of model precipitation. In particular, we use a novel
rainstorm identification and tracking algorithm that allocates essentially all
rainfall to individual precipitation events (Chang et al. 2016). This approach
allows multiple insights, including that, at least in these runs, model wet
bias is driven by excessive areal extent of precipitating events. Biases are
time-dependent, producing excessive diurnal cycle amplitude. We show that this
effect is produced not by new production of events but by excessive enlargement
of long-lived precipitation events during daytime, and that in the domain
average, precipitation biases appear best represented as additive offsets. Of
all model configurations evaluated, convection-permitting simulations most
consistently reduced biases in precipitation event characteristics.

hypergraph containing no copy of $T$ then $G$ has at most
$\frac{t-1}{r}\binom{n}{r-1}$ edges.
  A trunk $T'$ of a tight $r$-tree $T$ is a tight subtree such that every edge

For $r\ge 3$, the only nontrivial family of tight $r$-trees for which this

for all tight trees $T$ of bounded trunk size. This follows from our upper
bound on the size of a $T$-free $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ in terms of the size
of its shadow. We also give a short proof of Kalai's conjecture for tight
$r$-trees with at most four edges. In particular, for $3$-uniform hypergraphs,

remarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, one of their
major shortcomings is the fact that in practice, they tend to produce samples
with little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon,
known as mode collapse, has been the main focus of several recent advances in
GANs. Yet there is little understanding of why mode collapse happens and why
existing approaches are able to mitigate mode collapse. We propose a principled
approach to handling mode collapse, which we call packing. The main idea is to
modify the discriminator to make decisions based on multiple samples from the
same class, either real or artificially generated. We borrow analysis tools
from binary hypothesis testing---in particular the seminal result of Blackwell
[Bla53]---to prove a fundamental connection between packing and mode collapse.
We show that packing naturally penalizes generators with mode collapse, thereby
favoring generator distributions with less mode collapse during the training
process. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets suggests that packing
provides significant improvements in practice as well.

phenomena and data. Thus, uncertainty in communication is an intrinsic
component in the flocking modeling of the C-S model. In this paper, we provide
a class of admissible random uncertainties which allows us to perform the local
sensitivity analysis for flocking and establish stability to the random C-S
model with uncertain communication.

zero-inflated Poisson-Lindley distribution, called of zero-modified
Poisson-Lindley. The additional parameter $\pi$ of the zero-modified
Poisson-Lindley has a natural interpretation in terms of either
zero-deflated/inflated proportion. Inference is dealt with by using the
likelihood approach. In particular the maximum likelihood estimators of the
distribution's parameter are compared in small and large samples. We also
consider an alternative bias-correction mechanism based on Efron's bootstrap
resampling. The model is applied to real data sets and found to perform better
than other competing models.

regularity dimensions of the Patterson-Sullivan measure, which involves
controlling the relative measure of concentric balls. We then compute the
Assouad and lower dimensions of the limit set, which involves controlling local
doubling properties. Unlike the Hausdorff, packing, and box-counting
dimensions, we show that the Assouad and lower dimensions are not necessarily
given by the Poincar\'e exponent.

  Democratic-Linear Ellipticity Quantitities","22 pages including 8 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sides and medians are both Jacobi coordinate magnitudes, moreover then
equably entering the spherical coordinates on Kendall's shape sphere and the
Hopf coordinates. This motivates treating medians on the same footing as sides
in triangle geometry and the resulting Shape Theory. In this paper, we
consequently reformulate inequalities for the medians in terms of shape
quantities, and proceed to find inequalities on the mass-weighted Jacobi
coordinates. This work moreover identifies the $4/3$ -- powers of which occur
frequently in the theory of medians -- as the ratio of Jacobi masses.
  One of the Hopf coordinates is tetra-area. Another is anisoscelesness, which
parametrizes whether triangles are left-or-right leaning as bounded by
isoscelesness itself. The third is ellipticity, which parametrizes
tallness-or-flatness of triangles as bounded by regular triangles. Whereas
tetra-area is clearly cluster choice invariant, Jacobi coordinates,
anisoscelesness and ellipticity are cluster choice dependent but can be
`democratized' by averaging over all clusters. Democratized ellipticity
moreover trivializes, due to ellipticity being the difference of base-side and
median second moments, whose averages are equal to each other. Thus we
introduce a distinct `linear ellipticity' quantifier of tallness-or-flatness of
triangles whose democratization is nontrivial, and find inequalities bounding
this. Some of this paper's inequalities are shape-independent bounds, whereas
others' bounds depend on the isoperimetric ratio and arithmetic-to-geometric
side mean ratio shape variables.

is also shown that the linear space of ancient solutions of polynomial growth

These blue sky metamorphoses in the constant time wave fronts highlight the

leads to a detectable changes in the saline's ion-molecular composition and
hence changes in the osmotic pressure. This, in turn, leads to a stretching or

chemistry in the massive young protostellar core NGC 2264 CMM3. We investigated
the sensitivity of this chemistry to the physical conditions in its surrounding
environment. The results showed that deuteration, in the protostellar gas, is
affected by variations in the core density, the amount of gas depletion onto
grain surfaces, the CR ionisation rate, but it is insensitive to variations in
the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio.
  Our results, also, showed that deuteration is often enhanced in less-dense,
partially depleted ($<$ 85\%), or cores that are exerted to high CR ionisation
rates ($\ge$ 6.5 $\times$ 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ ). However, in NGC 2264 CMM3,
decreasing the amount of gas depleted onto grains and enhancing the CR
ionisation rate are often overestimating the observed values in the core. The
best fit time to observations occurs around (1 - 5) $\times$ 10$^4$ yrs for
core densities in the range (1 - 5) $\times$ 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ with CR
ionisation rate between (1.7 - 6.5)$\times$ 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. These values
are in agreement with the results of the most recent theoretical chemical model
of CMM3, and the time range of best fit is, also, in-line with the estimated
age of young protostellar objects.
  We conclude that deuterium chemistry in protostellar cores is: (i) sensitive
to variations in the physical conditions in its environment, %(ii) deuteration
in the protostellar gas is (ii) insensitive to changes in the H$_2$
ortho-to-para ratio. %, but is sensitive to these variations in the dark cloud
phase. We also conclude that the core NGC 2264 CMM3 is in its early stages of
chemical evolution with an estimated age of (1 - 5) $\times$ 10$^4$ yrs.

Therefore, it is important to understand how social media contributes to the

gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves. The plateau component is usually
interpreted as the dipole emission from a supra-massive magnetar, and the sharp
decay may imply the collapse of the magnetar to a black hole (BH). Fall-back
accretion onto the new-born BH could produce long-lasting activities via the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. The magnetic flux accumulated near the BH would
be confined by the accretion disks for a period of time. As the accretion rate
decreases, the magnetic flux is strong enough to obstruct gas infall, leading
to a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Within this scenario, we show that the
BZ process could produce two types of typical X-ray light curves: type I
exhibits a long-lasting plateau, followed by a power-law decay with slopes
ranging from 5/3 to 40/9; type II shows roughly a single power-law decay with
slope of 5/3. The former requires low magnetic filed strength, while the latter
corresponds to relatively high values. We search for such signatures of the
new-born BH from a sample of short GRBs with an internal plateau, and find two
candidates: GRB 101219A and GRB 160821B, corresponding to type II and type I

their face value, learning the appearances---objects, scenes, and body
poses---that distinguish each action class. However, such models are deprived
of the rich dynamic structure and motions that also define human activity. We
propose an approach that hallucinates the unobserved future motion implied by a
single snapshot to help static-image action recognition. The key idea is to
learn a prior over short-term dynamics from thousands of unlabeled videos,
infer the anticipated optical flow on novel static images, and then train
discriminative models that exploit both streams of information. Our main
contributions are twofold. First, we devise an encoder-decoder convolutional
neural network and a novel optical flow encoding that can translate a static
image into an accurate flow map. Second, we show the power of hallucinated flow
for recognition, successfully transferring the learned motion into a standard
two-stream network for activity recognition. On seven datasets, we demonstrate
the power of the approach. It not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for
dense optical flow prediction, but also consistently enhances recognition of
actions and dynamic scenes.

  Hierarchical Latent Tree Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel document generation process based on hierarchical latent
tree models (HLTMs) learned from data. An HLTM has a layer of observed word
variables at the bottom and multiple layers of latent variables on top. For
each document, we first sample values for the latent variables layer by layer
via logic sampling, then draw relative frequencies for the words conditioned on
the values of the latent variables, and finally generate words for the document
using the relative word frequencies. The motivation for the work is to take
word counts into consideration with HLTMs. In comparison with LDA-based
hierarchical document generation processes, the new process achieves
drastically better model fit with much fewer parameters. It also yields more
meaningful topics and topic hierarchies. It is the new state-of-the-art for the
hierarchical topic detection.

a ""step-up"" for their democracy, one in which previously homogenous regimes
transfer power to an opposition party that fairly won the election. After doing
so, liberal-democracy indicators and democracy indicators were evaluated in the
five years prior to and after the election took place, and over that ten-year

monitoring and numerous PCA-based systems have been developed to solve various
fault detection and diagnosis problems. Since PCA-based methods assume that the
monitored process is linear, nonlinear PCA models, such as autoencoder models
and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), has been proposed and applied
to nonlinear process monitoring. However, KPCA-based methods need to perform
eigen-decomposition (ED) on the kernel Gram matrix whose dimensions depend on
the number of training data. Moreover, prefixed kernel parameters cannot be
most effective for different faults which may need different parameters to
maximize their respective detection performances. Autoencoder models lack the
consideration of orthogonal constraints which is crucial for PCA-based
algorithms. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear
method, called neural component analysis (NCA), which intends to train a
feedforward neural work with orthogonal constraints such as those used in PCA.
NCA can adaptively learn its parameters through backpropagation and the
dimensionality of the nonlinear features has no relationship with the number of
training samples. Extensive experimental results on the Tennessee Eastman (TE)
benchmark process show the superiority of NCA in terms of missed detection rate
(MDR) and false alarm rate (FAR). The source code of NCA can be found in

applications, including cancer diagnosis, heart disease and neuro disorders.
The use of radioactive tracer in PET imaging raises concerns due to the risk of
radiation exposure. To minimize this potential risk in PET imaging, efforts
have been made to reduce the amount of radio-tracer usage. However, lowing dose
results in low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and loss of information, both of
which will heavily affect clinical diagnosis. Besides, the ill-conditioning of
low-dose PET image reconstruction makes it a difficult problem for iterative
reconstruction algorithms. Previous methods proposed are typically complicated
and slow, yet still cannot yield satisfactory results at significantly low
dose. Here, we propose a deep learning method to resolve this issue with an
encoder-decoder residual deep network with concatenate skip connections.
Experiments shows the proposed method can reconstruct low-dose PET image to a
standard-dose quality with only two-hundredth dose. Different cost functions
for training model are explored. Multi-slice input strategy is introduced to
provide the network with more structural information and make it more robust to
noise. Evaluation on ultra-low-dose clinical data shows that the proposed
method can achieve better result than the state-of-the-art methods and
reconstruct images with comparable quality using only 0.5% of the original

$p(x,z) = p(z) p(x \mid z)$ have the advantage of fast and exact sampling.
However, these models have the weakness of needing to specify $p(z)$, often

Undirected latent variable models discard the requirement that $p(z)$ be
specified with a prior, yet sampling from them generally requires an iterative
procedure such as blocked Gibbs-sampling that may require many steps to draw
samples from the joint distribution $p(x, z)$. We propose a novel approach to
learning the joint distribution between the data and a latent code which uses
an adversarially learned iterative procedure to gradually refine the joint
distribution, $p(x, z)$, to better match with the data distribution on each
step. GibbsNet is the best of both worlds both in theory and in practice.
Achieving the speed and simplicity of a directed latent variable model, it is
guaranteed (assuming the adversarial game reaches the virtual training criteria
global minimum) to produce samples from $p(x, z)$ with only a few sampling
iterations. Achieving the expressiveness and flexibility of an undirected
latent variable model, GibbsNet does away with the need for an explicit $p(z)$

and joint image-attribute modeling in a single model which is not trained for
any of these specific tasks. We show empirically that GibbsNet is able to learn
a more complex $p(z)$ and show that this leads to improved inpainting and

  detailed proofs in appendices",,,,"math.CO cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information has intrinsic geometric and topological structure, arising from
relative relationships beyond absolute values or types. For instance, the fact
that two people share a meal describes a relationship independent of the meal's
ingredients. Multiple such relationships give rise to relations and their
lattices. Lattices have topology. That topology informs the ways in which
information may be observed, hidden, inferred, and dissembled.
  Dowker's Theorem establishes a homotopy equivalence between two simplicial
complexes derived from a relation. From a privacy perspective, one complex
describes individuals with common attributes, the other describes attributes
shared by individuals. The homotopy equivalence produces a lattice. An element
in the lattice consists of two components, one being a set of individuals, the
other being a set of attributes. The lattice operations join and meet each
amount to set intersection in one component and set union followed by a
potentially privacy-puncturing inference in the other component.
  Privacy loss appears as simplicial collapse of free faces. Such collapse is
local, but the property of fully preserving both attribute and association
privacy requires a global condition: a particular kind of spherical hole. By
looking at the link of an identifiable individual in its encompassing Dowker
complex, one can characterize that individual's attribute privacy via another
sphere condition. Even when long-term attribute privacy is impossible, homology
provides lower bounds on how an individual may defer identification, when that
individual has control over how to reveal attributes. Intuitively, the idea is
to first reveal information that could otherwise be inferred. This last result
highlights privacy as a dynamic process. Privacy loss may be cast as gradient
flow. Harmonic flow for privacy preservation may be fertile ground for future
research.

almost all results that are related to calculating the minimum hybridisation

number in terms of agreement forests for |P|>2 remains elusive. In this paper,
we characterise the minimum hybridisation number for when P is of arbitrary

work on cherry-picking sequences, we first establish a new characterisation to
compute the minimum hybridisation number in the space of tree-child networks.

presence of adversarial jammers. We first provide a general model including an
arbitrary number of jammers, and show that its capacity region is equivalent to
that of a simplified model in which the received jamming signal at each decoder
is independent. Next, existing outer and inner bounds for two-user Gaussian
interference channel are generalized for this simplified jamming model. We show
that for certain problem parameters, precisely the same bounds hold, but with
the noise variance increased by the received power of the jammer at each
receiver. Thus, the jammers can do no better than to transmit Gaussian noise.
For these problem parameters, this allows us to recover the half-bit theorem.
In weak and strong interference regime, our inner bound matches the
corresponding Han-Kobayashi bound with increased noise variance by the received
power of the jammer, and even in strong interference we achieve the exact
capacity. Furthermore, we determine the symmetric degrees of freedom where the
signal-to-noise, interference-to-noise and jammer-to-noise ratios are all tend
to infinity. Moreover, we show that, if the jammer has greater received power
than the legitimate user, symmetrizability makes the capacity zero. The proof
of the outer bound is straightforward, while the inner bound generalizes the
Han-Kobayashi rate splitting scheme. As a novel aspect, the inner bound takes
advantage of the common message acting as common randomness for the private
message; hence, the jammer cannot symmetrize only the private codeword without
being detected. This complication requires an extra condition on the signal
power, so that in general our inner bound is not identical to the Han-Kobayashi
bound. We also prove a new variation of the packing lemma that applies for
multiple Gaussian codebooks in an adversarial setting.

ultra-low latency and reliable data analytics solutions that can combine, in

conventional cloud-centric data processing techniques whose communication and

tailored to the unique ITS environment must be developed. In this paper, an
edge analytics architecture for ITSs is introduced in which data is processed
at the vehicle or roadside smart sensor level in order to overcome the ITS
latency and reliability challenges. With a higher capability of passengers'
mobile devices and intra-vehicle processors, such a distributed edge computing
architecture can leverage deep learning techniques for reliable mobile sensing
in ITSs. In this context, the ITS mobile edge analytics challenges pertaining
to heterogeneous data, autonomous control, vehicular platoon control, and
cyber-physical security are investigated. Then, different deep learning
solutions for such challenges are proposed. The proposed deep learning
solutions will enable ITS edge analytics by endowing the ITS devices with
powerful computer vision and signal processing functions. Preliminary results
show that the proposed edge analytics architecture, coupled with the power of

exploration. However, its potential is confined by its limited on-board battery
energy and data storage capacity. This problem has been addressed using docking
systems by underwater recharging and data transfer for AUVs. In this work, we
propose a vision based framework for underwater docking following these
systems. The proposed framework comprises two modules; (i) a detection module
which provides location information on underwater docking stations in 2D images
captured by an on-board camera, and (ii) a pose estimation module which
recovers the relative 3D position and orientation between docking stations and
AUVs from the 2D images. For robust and credible detection of docking stations,
we propose a convolutional neural network called Docking Neural Network (DoNN).
For accurate pose estimation, a perspective-n-point algorithm is integrated
into our framework. In order to examine our framework in underwater docking
tasks, we collected a dataset of 2D images, named Underwater Docking Images
Dataset (UDID), in an experimental water pool. To the best of our knowledge,
UDID is the first publicly available underwater docking dataset. In the
experiments, we first evaluate performance of the proposed detection module on
UDID and its deformed variations. Next, we assess the accuracy of the pose
estimation module by ground experiments, since it is not feasible to obtain
true relative position and orientation between docking stations and AUVs under
water. Then, we examine the pose estimation module by underwater experiments in
our experimental water pool. Experimental results show that the proposed
framework can be used to detect docking stations and estimate their relative
pose efficiently and successfully, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline
systems.

and parameters are not faithful. In this paper, we address the problem of the
formulation of nested complex of parameters by regarding the feature map as a
transport map. Even when a feature map has different dimensions between input
and output, we can regard it as a transportation map by considering that both
the input and output spaces are embedded in a common high-dimensional space. In
addition, the trajectory is a geometric object and thus, is independent of
parameterization. In this manner, transportation can be regarded as a universal
character of deep neural networks. By determining and analyzing the
transportation dynamics, we can understand the behavior of a deep neural
network. In this paper, we investigate a fundamental case of deep neural
networks: the DAE. We derive the transport map of the DAE, and reveal that the
infinitely deep DAE transports mass to decrease a certain quantity, such as

the current move of the random walk models is determined by randomly selecting
a move from history. At each step, particle can take right, left or stay moves
which is correlated with the randomly selected past step. There is a perfect
stay-stay correlation which ensures that the particle does not move if the
randomly selected past step is a stay move. The probability of traversing the
same direction as the chosen history or reversing it depends on the current
time and the time or position of the history selected. The time or position
dependent biasing in moves implicitly corresponds to the heterogeneity of the
environment and dictates the long-time behavior of the dynamics that can be
diffusive, sub or super diffusive. A combination of analytical solution and
Monte Carlo simulation of different random walk models gives rich insight on

asymmetric quantum Rabi models (AQRM), specifically, to determine the
degeneracy of their eigenstates. Here, the Hamiltonian
$H^{\epsilon}_{\text{Rabi}}$ of the AQRM is defined by adding the fluctuation
term $\epsilon \sigma_x$, with $\sigma_x$ being the Pauli matrix, to the
Hamiltonian of the quantum Rabi model, breaking its $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry.
The spectrum of $H^{\epsilon}_{\text{Rabi}}$ contains a set of exceptional
eigenvalues, considered to be remains of the eigenvalues of the uncoupled
bosonic mode, which are further classified in two types: Juddian, associated
with polynomial eigensolutions, and non-Juddian exceptional. We explicitly
describe the constraint relations for allowing the model to have exceptional
eigenvalues. By studying these relations we obtain the proof of the conjecture
on constraint polynomials previously proposed by the third author. In fact, we
prove that the spectrum of the AQRM possesses degeneracies if and only if the
parameter $\epsilon$ is a half-integer. Moreover, we show that non-Juddian
exceptional eigenvalues do not contribute any degeneracy and we characterize
exceptional eigenvalues by representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. Upon these
results, we draw the whole picture of the spectrum of the AQRM. Furthermore,
generating functions of constraint polynomials from the viewpoint of confluent
Heun equations are also discussed.

frequent subsequences from a sequence database. A practical limitation of these
techniques is that they overload the user with too many patterns. Local Process
Model (LPM) mining is an alternative approach coming from the field of process
mining. While in traditional sequential pattern mining, a pattern describes one
subsequence, an LPM captures a set of subsequences. Also, while traditional
sequential patterns only match subsequences that are observed in the sequence
database, an LPM may capture subsequences that are not explicitly observed, but
that are related to observed subsequences. In other words, LPMs generalize the
behavior observed in the sequence database. These properties make it possible
for a set of LPMs to cover the behavior of a much larger set of sequential
patterns. Yet, existing LPM mining techniques still suffer from the pattern
explosion problem because they produce sets of redundant LPMs. In this paper,
we propose several heuristics to mine a set of non-redundant LPMs either from a
set of redundant LPMs or from a set of sequential patterns. We empirically
compare the proposed heuristics between them and against existing (local)
process mining techniques in terms of coverage, redundancy, and complexity of
the produced sets of LPMs.

inter-connected network domains, each managed by one SDN controller, is an
emerging networking architecture that offers balanced centralized control and
distributed operations. Under such networking paradigm, most existing works
focus on designing sophisticated controller-synchronization strategies to
improve joint controller-decision-making for inter-domain routing. However,
there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of how the performance of
distributed SDN is related to network attributes, thus impossible to justify
the necessity of complicated strategies. In this regard, we analyze and
quantify the performance enhancement of distributed SDN architectures,
influenced by intra-/inter-domain synchronization levels and network structural
properties. Based on a generic weighted network model, we establish analytical
methods for performance estimation under four synchronization scenarios with
increasing synchronization cost. Moreover, two of these synchronization
scenarios correspond to extreme cases, i.e., minimum/maximum synchronization,
which are, therefore, capable of bounding the performance of distributed SDN
with any given synchronization levels. Our theoretical results reveal how
network performance is related to synchronization levels and inter-domain
connections, the accuracy of which are confirmed by simulations based on both
real and synthetic networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work quantifying the performance of distributed SDN analytically, which
provides fundamental guidance for future SDN protocol designs and performance
estimation.

this paper defines a notion of temporal stability for binary classification

XGBoost and LSTM neural networks exhibit the highest temporal stability. We

integrates human policy with the RL policy to achieve the target objective with

be captured in a mean motion resonance while still embedded in their nesting
circumstellar disk. Aims: The goal is to estimate the direction and amount of
shift in the semimajor axis of the resonance location due to the disk gravity
as a function of the gas density and mass of the planets. The stability of the
resonance lock when the disk dissipates is also tested. Methods: The orbital
evolution of a large number of systems is numerically integrated within a
three-body problem in which the disk potential is computed as a series of
expansion. This is a good approximation, at least over a limited amount of
time. Results: Two different resonances are studied: the 2:1 and the 3:2. In
both cases the shift is inwards, even if by a different amount, when the
planets are massive and carve a gap in the disk. For super--Earths, the shift
is instead outwards. Different disk densities, Sigma, are considered and the
resonance shift depends almost linearly on Sigma. The gas dissipation leads to
destabilization of a significant number of resonant systems, in particular if
it is fast. Conclusions: The presence of a massive circumstellar disk may
significantly affect the resonant behavior of a pair of planets by shifting the
resonant location and by decreasing the size of the stability region. The disk
dissipation may explain some systems found close to a resonance but not locked
in it.

it has been tacked in a number of different ways. However, existing approaches
fail to capture the nature of swarm intelligence and they are either too
abstract for practical application or not generic enough to describe the
various types of emergence phenomena. In this paper, a contradiction-centric
model for swarm intelligence is proposed, in which individuals determine their
behaviors based on their internal contradictions whilst they associate and
interact to update their contradictions. The model hypothesizes that 1) the
emergence of swarm intelligence is rooted in the development of individuals'
internal contradictions and the interactions taking place between individuals
and the environment, and 2) swarm intelligence is essentially a combinative
reflection of the configurations of individuals' internal contradictions and
the distributions of these contradictions across individuals. The model is
formally described and five swarm intelligence systems are studied to
illustrate its broad applicability. The studies confirm the generic character
of the model and its effectiveness for describing the emergence of various
kinds of swarm intelligence; and they also demonstrate that the model is
straightforward to apply, without the need for complicated computations.

often compiled correctly with no syntax or semantic errors. However, some other
errors appear after the execution of the program (logical error). Logical
Errors (LE) are errors that remain after all syntax errors have been removed.
Usually, the compiler does not detect LE, so the produced results are different
from what the programmer is expecting. For this reason, discovering and fixing
the logical error is very hard and proposes a good topic for research and
practice. Some LE are resulted from the misuse of classes' objects, and in
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), it is considered that the software with
LE is low-quality software with high maintenance cost. In this paper, an

radiation images is shown to result from the high degree of anisotropy in the

important, as the radiation from the high-field side can be stronger by a
factor $10^6$ than the radiation from the low-field side in DIII-D. By
combining a kinetic model of the runaway dynamics with a synthetic synchrotron

we look at the selection of legislators by lot as a way to tame some of the
drawbacks of that system. It is recalled at the beginning that resorting to
sortition for the selection of public officers used to be a popular way of
taming factionalism in public affairs. Factionalism is assumed to be
detrimental to public affairs as public officers may favour their own faction
(a tribe or a party) instead of pursuing the general interest. Moreover they
tend to overinvest in strengthening their power, thus engaging in power
struggles with opposing factions, unlikely to benefit society. In this respect
we present a new mathematical model aiming at describing a more efficient
parliament where sortition is brought to bear. It will be shown that starting
from a parliament working with two parties (or coalitions), where the costs of
representative democracy are quite apparent through the detrimental effects of
party discipline, one can beneficially move towards a parliament where
independent legislators, randomly selected from the population of constituents,
sit alongside elected members who belong to a party and are subjected to party
discipline. The paper shows that increasing the number of independent
legislators up to a point enhances the efficiency of the parliament and puts
into check the factionalism likely to arise from party discipline.

inferred results. However, previous studies only qualitatively evaluated image
outputs in data space, and the mechanism behind the inference has not been
investigated. The purpose of the current study is to numerically analyze
changes in activity patterns of neurons in the latent space of a deep
generative model called a ""variational auto-encoder"" (VAE). What kinds of
inference dynamics the VAE demonstrates when noise is added to the input data
are identified. The VAE embeds a dataset with clear cluster structures in the
latent space and the center of each cluster of multiple correlated data points
(memories) is referred as the concept. Our study demonstrated that transient
dynamics of inference first approaches a concept, and then moves close to a
memory. Moreover, the VAE revealed that the inference dynamics approaches a
more abstract concept to the extent that the uncertainty of input data
increases due to noise. It was demonstrated that by increasing the number of
the latent variables, the trend of the inference dynamics to approach a concept
can be enhanced, and the generalization ability of the VAE can be improved.

ferroelectricity for very small particles. However there are also reports in
the literature of ultra-high values of permittivity when specific processes or
doping are performed, for instance in the BT-family, or in the CaCu3Ti4O12-

these effects in the framework of a core-shell model of ceramics. The ultrahigh
values mentioned above could be reproduced by considering that the core (be it
dielectric or ferroelectric) have non-zero conductivity. In particular a huge
background of permittivity and a Maxwell Wagner relaxation were obtained in
agreement with the experimental situation. Different types of inhomogeneity
(grain size distribution, mixing of conductive and non-conductive phases,
porosity) have also been considered and their effects are discussed. Finally we
have evaluated the potentiality of energy storage in IBLC compounds and
observed a reduction (compared with non-conductive ferroelectrics) by a factor
2-4 depending on the structuration of the ceramic, which shows that the
performance of such compounds are lower than in optimal insulating core-shell

sequential inference: the posterior distribution obtained after seeing a
dataset can be used as prior for a second inference. However, when Monte Carlo
sampling methods are used for inference, we only have a set of samples from the
posterior distribution. To do sequential inference, we then either have to
evaluate the second posterior at only these locations and reweight the samples
accordingly, or we can estimate a functional description of the posterior
probability distribution from the samples and use that as prior for the second
inference. Here, we investigated to what extent we can obtain an accurate joint
posterior from two datasets if the inference is done sequentially rather than
jointly, under the condition that each inference step is done using Monte Carlo
sampling. To test this, we evaluated the accuracy of kernel density estimates,
Gaussian mixtures, vine copulas and Gaussian processes in approximating
posterior distributions, and then tested whether these approximations can be
used in sequential inference. In low dimensionality, Gaussian processes are
more accurate, whereas in higher dimensionality Gaussian mixtures or vine
copulas perform better. In our test cases, posterior approximations are
preferable over direct sample reweighting, although joint inference is still
preferable over sequential inference. Since the performance is case-specific,
we provide an R package mvdens with a unified interface for the density
approximation methods.

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has been frequently associated with non-thermal processes
occurring in the magnetospheres of their supermassive black holes. The present
work aims to explore the adequacy of different gap-type (unscreened electric
field) models to account for the observed characteristics. Based on a
phenomenological description of the gap potential, we estimate the maximum
extractable gap power $L_{gap}$ for different magnetospheric set-ups, and study
its dependence on the accretion state of the source. $L_{gap}$ is found to be
in general proportional to the Blandford-Znajek jet power $L_{BZ}$ and a
sensitive function of gap size $h$, i.e. $L_{gap} \sim L_{BZ} (h/r_g)^{\beta}$,
where the power index $\beta \geq 1$ is dependent on the respective gap-setup.
The transparency of the black hole vicinity to VHE photons generally requires a
radiatively inefficient accretion environment and thereby imposes constraints
on possible accretion rates, and correspondingly on $L_{BZ}$. Similarly, rapid
variability, if observed, may allow to constrain the gap size $h\sim c \Delta
t$. Combining these constraints, we provide a general classification to assess
the likelihood that the VHE gamma-ray emission observed from an AGN can be
attributed to a magnetospheric origin. When applied to prominent candidate
sources these considerations suggest that the variable (day-scale) VHE activity
seen in the radio galaxy M87 could be compatible with a magnetospheric origin,
while such an origin appears less likely for the (minute-scale) VHE activity in
IC310.

accurate measurements of supermassive black hole masses and uniquely probe the

independent crucial constraints of the Hubble Constant in the nearby universe,
and thus, the arguably best single constraint on the nature of dark energy. The
chances of finding these golden standards are however abysmally low, at an
overall =< 3% for any level of water maser emission detected at 22 GHz, and =<
1% for those exhibiting the disk-like configuration. We provide here a thorough
summary of the current state of the detection of water megamaser disks, along
with a novel investigation of the likelihood of increasing their detection
rates based on a multivariate parameter analysis of optical and mid-infrared
photometric properties of the largest database of galaxies surveyed for the 22
GHz emission. We find that galaxies with water megamaser emission tend to
associate with strong emission in all WISE mid-infrared wavelengths, with the
strongest enhancement in the W4 band, at 22 micron, as well as with previously
proposed and newly found indicators of AGN strength in the mid-infrared, such
as red W1-W2 and W1-W4 colors, and the integrated mid-infrared luminosity of

particularly focusing on vertical flows that are ubiquitously excited by
magnetic activity. In local regions where the magnetic filed is stronger, it is
frequently seen that fast down-flows slide along inclined magnetic field lines
that are associated with buoyantly rising magnetic loops. The vertical velocity
of these down-flows reaches ~ 100 km s$^{-1}$ near the foot-point of the loops
by the gravitational acceleration toward the Galactic plane. The two footpoints
of rising magnetic loops are generally located at different radial locations
and the field lines are deformed by the differential rotation. The angular
momentum is transported along the field lines, and the radial force balance
breaks down. As a result, a fast downflow is often observed only at the one
footpoint located at the inner radial position. The fast downflow compresses
the gas to form a dense region near the footpoint, which will be important in
star formation afterward. Furthermore, the horizontal components of the
velocity are also fast near the foot-point because the down-flow is accelerated
along the magnetic sliding slope. As a result, the high-velocity flow creates
various characteristic features in a simulated position-velocity diagram,

three antiferromagnetically coupled Fe atoms(Fe trimer) was positioned on a
Cu2N/Cu(100) surface and contacted with the spin-polarized tip of a scanning
tunneling microscope, thus coupling the Fe trimer to one non-magnetic and one
magnetic lead. Pronounced NDR appears at the low bias of 7 mV where inelastic
electron tunneling dynamically locks the atomic spin in a long-lived excited
state. This causes a rapid increase of the magnetoresistance between
spin-polarized tip and Fe trimer and quenches elastic tunneling. By varying the
coupling strength between tip and Fe trimer we find that in this transport
regime the dynamic locking of the Fe trimer competes with magnetic exchange
interaction, which statically forces the Fe trimer into the
high-magnetoresistance state and removes the NDR.

interactions of two elements having multiple types of mutually causal
relationships, rather than a mixture of simultaneous correlations or the
absence of presence of a causal relationship between the elements. In
multivariate statistics, partial canonical correlation analysis (PCCA)
evaluates the correlation between two multivariates after subtracting the
effect of the third multivariate. PCCA can calculate the Granger Causal- ity
Index (which tests whether a time-series can be predicted from an- other
time-series), but is not applicable to data containing multiple partial
canonical correlations. After introducing the MPPCCA, we propose an
expectation-maxmization (EM) algorithm that estimates the parameters and latent
variables of the MPPCCA. The MPPCCA is expected to ex- tract multiple partial
canonical correlations from data series without any supervised signals to split
the data as clusters. The method was then eval- uated in synthetic data
experiments. In the synthetic dataset, our method estimated the multiple
partial canonical correlations more accurately than the existing method. To
determine the types of patterns detectable by the method, experiments were also
conducted on real datasets. The method estimated the communication patterns In

to represent evolutionary histories in which reticulation events (such as
recombination and hybridization) have occurred. A central question for such
networks is that of identifiability, which essentially asks under what
circumstances can we reliably identify the phylogenetic network that gave rise
to the observed data? Recently, identifiability results have appeared for
networks relative to a model of sequence evolution that generalizes the
standard Markov models used for phylogenetic trees. However, these results are
quite limited in terms of the complexity of the networks that are considered.
In this paper, by introducing an alternative probabilistic model for evolution
along a network that is based on some ground-breaking work by Thatte for
pedigrees, we are able to obtain an identifiability result for a much larger
class of phylogenetic networks (essentially the class of so-called tree-child
networks). To prove our main theorem, we derive some new results for
identifying tree-child networks combinatorially, and then adapt some techniques
developed by Thatte for pedigrees to show that our combinatorial results imply
identifiability in the probabilistic setting. We hope that the introduction of
our new model for networks could lead to new approaches to reliably construct
phylogenetic networks.

so-called $\Lambda$-Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi~($\Lambda$LTB) solution. Then, we
restrict the models to the asymptotically homogeneous models each of which is
approximated by a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker model. The late
time $\Lambda$LTB models are parametrized by four parameters including the
value of the cosmological constant and the local Hubble parameter. The other
two parameters are used to parametrize the observed distance-redshift relation.
Then, the $\Lambda$LTB models are constructed so that they are compatible with
the given distance-redshift relation. Including conventional parameters for the
CMB analysis, we characterize our models by seven parameters in total. The
local Hubble measurements are reflected in the prior distribution of the local
Hubble parameter. As a result of a Markov-Chains-Monte-Carlo analysis for the
CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, we found that the inhomogeneous
universe models with vanishing cosmological constant are ruled out as is
expected. However, a significant under-density around us is still compatible
with the angular power spectrum of CMB and the local Hubble parameter.

the maximum BNL energy. Inspired by existing quark billiards, the main goal of
this work was extending CMBE to partons. Thus, we first implemented a
confinement algorithm founded on some intuitive assumptions: 1) the system can
be decomposed into a set of two or three-body quark white clusters; 2) the
bi-particle force is limited to the domain of each cluster; 3) the physical
solution conforms to the minimum potential energy requirement. Color
conservation was also treated as part of the reactions logic module. As an
example of use, we proposed a toy-model for p + p collisions at sqrt(s)=10 GeV
and we compared it with HIJING. Another direction of interest was related to
retarded interactions. Following this purpose, we implemented an Euler retarded
algorithm and we tested it on a simple two-body system with attractive
inverse-square-law force. First results suggest that retarded interactions may
contribute to the Virial theorem anomalies (dark matter) encountered for
gravitational systems (e.g. clusters of galaxies). On the other hand, the time
reverse functionality implemented in CMBE v03 could be used together with
retardation for analyzing the Loschmidt paradox. Regarding the application

super-massive black hole (SMBH) has not always been as low as it is nowadays.
The observation of varying non-thermal diffuse X-ray emission in molecular
complexes in the central 300 pc has been interpreted as delayed reflection of a
past illumination by bright outbursts of the SMBH. The observation of different
variability timescales of the reflected emission in the Sgr A molecular complex
can be well explained if the X-ray emission of at least two distinct and
relatively short events (i.e. about 10 years or less) is currently propagating
through the region. The number of such events or the presence of a
long-duration illumination are open questions.
  Variability of the reflected emission all over of the central 300 pc, in
particular in the 6.4 keV Fe Ka line, can bring strong constraints. To do so we
performed a deep scan of the inner 300 pc with XMM-Newton in 2012. Together
with all the archive data taken over the course of the mission, and in
particular a similar albeit more shallow scan performed in 2000-2001, this
allows for a detailed study of variability of the 6.4 keV line emission in the
region, which we present here.
  We show that the overall 6.4 keV emission does not strongly vary on average,
but variations are very pronounced on smaller scales. In particular, most
regions showing bright reflection emission in 2000-2001 significantly decrease
by 2012. We discuss those regions and present newly illuminated features. The
absence of bright steady emission argues against the presence of an echo from
an event of multi-centennial duration and most, if not all, of the emission can
likely be explained by a limited number of relatively short (i.e. up to 10
years) events.

perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications
because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on
detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores
such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are
available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs
to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute
models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we
emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model
decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world
black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are
easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple
defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this
category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce
the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large
adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while
staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no
hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive
with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like
ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com.
The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in
general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and
raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems.

3 dimensional distributions, that have the property that for $q\rightarrow

we deal with 3 dimensional generalization of Kesten--McKay distribution. In a
very special case when $\rho _{12}\rho _{13}\rho _{23}=q$ all one dimensional
marginals are identical, semicircle distributions. We find both all marginal as
well as all conditional distributions. Moreover, we find also families of
polynomials that are orthogonalized by these one-dimensional margins and
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Consequently, we find moments of
both conditional and unconditional distributions of dimensions one and two. In
particular, we show that all one-dimensional and two-dimensional conditional
moments of, say, order $n$ and are polynomials of the same order $n$ in the
conditioning random variables. Finding above mentioned orthogonal polynomials
leads us to a probabilistic interpretation of these polynomials. Among them are
the famous Askey-Wilson, Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials considered in the
complex, but conjugate, parameters, as well as q-Hermite and Rogers

queues operating under Markov modulation (meaning that the system's parameters
depend on an autonomously evolving background process). In previous papers on
(primarily single-node) queues with Markov modulation, two variants were
distinguished: one in which the server speed is modulated, and one in which the
service requirement is modulated (i.e., depends on the state of the background
process upon arrival). The setup of the present paper, however, is more
general, as we allow both the server speed and the service requirement to
depend on the background process. For this model we derive a Functional Central
Limit Theorem: we show that, after accelerating the arrival processes and the
background process, a centered and normalized version of the network population
vector converges to a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The proof of
this result relies on expressing the queueing process in terms of Poisson
processes with a random time change, an application of the Martingale Central
Limit Theorem, and continuous-mapping arguments.

created due to gravity. However, we found that thin-film hydraulic jumps are
not induced by gravity. This study explores the initiation of thin-film
hydraulic jumps. For circular jumps produced by the normal impingement of a jet
onto a solid surface, we found that the jump is formed when surface tension and
viscous forces balance the momentum in the film and gravity plays no
significant role. Experiments show no dependence on the orientation of the
surface and a scaling relation balancing viscous forces and surface tension
collapses the experimental data. Experiments on thin film planar jumps in a
channel also show that the predominant balance is with surface tension,
although for the thickness of the films we studied gravity also played a role
in the jump formation. A theoretical analysis shows that the downstream
transport of surface tension energy is the previously neglected, critical
ingredient in these flows and that capillary waves play the role of gravity
waves in a traditional jump in demarcating the transition from the
supercritical to subcritical flow associated with these jumps.

shallow free-surface gravity flows which was initiated by [Bouchut-Boyaval,
M3AS (23) 2013] for 1D (translation invariant) cases. The models we propose are
hyperbolic quasilinear systems that generalize Saint-Venant shallow-water
equations to incompressible Maxwell fluids. The models are compatible with a
formulation of the thermo-dynamics second principle. In comparison with
Saint-Venant standard shallow-water model, the momentum balance includes
extra-stresses associated with an elastic potential energy in addition to a
hydrostatic pressure. The extra-stresses are determined by an additional tensor
variable solution to a differential equation with various possible time rates.
For the numerical evaluation of solutions to Cauchy problems, we also propose
explicit schemes discretizing our generalized Saint-Venant systems with
Finite-Volume approximations that are entropy-consistent (under a CFL
constraint) in addition to satisfy exact (discrete) mass and momentum
conservation laws. In comparison with most standard viscoelastic numerical
models, our discrete models can be used for any retardation-time values (i.e.
in the vanishing ""solvent-viscosity"" limit). We finally illustrate our
hyperbolic viscoelastic flow models numerically using computer simulations in
benchmark test cases. On extending to Maxwell fluids some free-shear flow
testcases that are standard benchmarks for Newtonian fluids, we first show that
our (numerical) models reproduce well the viscoelastic physics,
phenomenologically at least, with zero retardation-time. Moreover, with a view
to quantitative evaluations, numerical results in the lid-driven cavity
testcase show that, in fact, our models can be compared with standard
viscoelastic flow models in sheared-flow benchmarks on adequately choosing the
physical parameters of our models. Analyzing our models asymptotics should
therefore shed new light on the famous High-Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP),
which is a limit for all the existing viscoelastic numerical models.

the polarization is about $0.16$ nC/m, which is comparable to that of monolayer
SnTe studied in recent experiment, and the intrinsic Curie temperature is
estimated to be above 200 K. Interestingly, owing to its puckered structure,
the physical properties of $\beta$-GeSe can be easily controlled by strain. The
Curie temperature can be raised above room temperature by applying a ($\sim

increased by strains in either armchair or zigzag directions. Furthermore, we
find that for the case with electron doping, applying strain can readily tune
the anisotropic electric transport with the preferred conducting direction
rotated by $90^\circ$, which is connected with a strain-induced Lifshitz
transition. The ratio between the effective masses along the two in-plane

jointly optimizing edge caching and transmission strategies. In order to
account for the cache capacity limitations at the Edge Nodes (ENs),
transmission generally involves both fronthaul transfer from a cloud processor
with access to the content library to the ENs, as well as wireless delivery
from the ENs to the users. In this paper, the resulting problem is studied from
an information-theoretic viewpoint by making the following practically relevant
assumptions: 1) the ENs have multiple antennas; 2) only uncoded fractional
caching is allowed; 3) the fronthaul links are used to send fractions of
contents; and 4) the ENs are constrained to use one-shot linear precoding on
the wireless channel. Assuming offline proactive caching and focusing on a high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) latency metric, the optimal information-theoretic
performance is investigated under both serial and pipelined fronthaul-edge
transmission modes. The analysis characterizes the minimum high-SNR latency in
terms of Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) for worst-case users' demands. The
characterization is exact for a subset of system parameters, and is generally
optimal within a multiplicative factor of 3/2 for the serial case and of 2 for
the pipelined case. The results bring insights into the optimal interplay
between edge and cloud processing in fog-aided wireless networks as a function

quantify the gravitational-wave luminosity of binary neutron star merger
events, and set upper limits on the radiated energy and the remnant angular
momentum from these events. We find that there is an empirical universal
relation connecting the total gravitational radiation and the angular momentum
of the remnant. Our results constrain the final spin of the remnant black-hole
and also indicate that stable neutron star remnant forms with super-Keplerian
angular momentum.

importance from a fundamental and practical viewpoint. While the freezing of a
water droplet has been extensively studied, little information is available
about the characteristics of freezing a nanofluid droplet. Here, we report
unique shape changes observed during the freezing process of a nanofluid
droplet. Instead of forming a pointy tip on the frozen deionized water droplet,
we found that the top of a frozen nanofluid droplet exhibits a flat plateau
shape and such plateau becomes larger with increasing nanoparticle
concentration. We ascribe this characteristic shape change to an outward
Marangoni flow which moves liquid from the droplet interior to its vertexes,
thus engendering the volume redistribution and shape changes. Moreover, we also
observed a particle ring pattern formed during freezing of a nanofluid droplet,
which is similar to the well-known coffee stain phenomenon occurring during
evaporation of a water droplet with dispersed particles. We believe our
reported phenomena are not only of fundamental interest but have potential
applications in the freezing of nanofluids for energy storage and developing
nanofluid based new microfabrication methods.

by an augmented state-vector whose time evolution is determined by a Hermitian

distribution can be expanded into a complete set of normal modes that satisfy
generalized orthogonality relations. Importantly, the modal expansions in
dispersive systems are not unique because the electromagnetic degrees of
freedom span only part of the entire Hilbert space. The developed theory is
used to obtain a modal expansion of the system Green's function.
  Furthermore, it is highlighted that the Hermitian-type formulation of the
dispersive Maxwell's equations enables one to extend the powerful ideas of
topological photonics to a wide range of electromagnetic systems and to
characterize electromagnetic topological phases. In addition, we illustrate how

analyse a large spectroscopic and high-resolution spectropolarimetric dataset.

adversaries can de-anonymize users' identities by mapping them to correlated

various cost functions in hope of measuring the quality of mappings. However,
there is generally a lacking of rationale behind the cost functions, whose
minimizer also remains algorithmically unknown. We jointly tackle above
concerns under a more practical social network model parameterized by
overlapping communities, which, neglected by prior art, can serve as side
information for de-anonymization. Regarding the unavailability of ground-truth
mapping to adversaries, by virtue of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), our
first contribution is a well-justified cost function minimizing the expected
number of mismatched users over all possible true mappings. While proving the
NP-hardness of minimizing MMSE, we validly transform it into the weighted-edge
matching problem (WEMP), which, as disclosed theoretically, resolves the
tension between optimality and complexity: (i) WEMP asymptotically returns a
negligible mapping error in large network size under mild conditions
facilitated by higher overlapping strength; (ii) WEMP can be algorithmically
characterized via the convex-concave based de-anonymization algorithm (CBDA),
perfectly finding the optimum of WEMP. Extensive experiments further confirm
the effectiveness of CBDA under overlapping communities, in terms of averagely
90% re-identified users in the rare true cross-domain co-author networks when
communities overlap densely, and roughly 70% enhanced re-identification ratio

been constructed. These are rotating BHs surrounded, as fully non-linear
solutions of the appropriate Einstein-matter model, by a non-trivial bosonic
field in synchronised rotation with the BH horizon. Some families bifurcate
globally from a bald BH ($e.g.$ the Kerr BH), whereas others bifurcate only
locally from a bald BH ($e.g.$ the $D=5$ Myers-Perry BH). It would be desirable
to understand how generically synchronisation allows hairy BHs to bifurcate
from bald ones. However, the construction and scanning of the domain of
existence of the former families of BHs can be a difficult and time consuming
(numerical) task. Here, we first provide a simple perturbative argument to
understand the generality of the synchronisation condition. Then, we observe
that the study of Q-clouds is a generic tool to establish the existence of BHs
with synchronised hair bifurcating (globally or locally) from a given bald BH
without having to solve the fully non-linear coupled system of Einstein-matter
equations. As examples, we apply this tool to establish the existence of
synchronised hair around $D=6$ Myers-Perry BHs, $D=5$ black rings and $D=4$
Kerr-AdS BHs, where $D$ is the spacetime dimension. The black rings case
provides an example of BHs with synchronised hair beyond spherical horizon
topology, further establishing the generality of the mechanism.

bounded by a state-independent constant. However, such a bound can be violated
if the quantum system is entangled with another quantum system (called memory);
the quantum correlation between the systems can reduce the measurement
uncertainty. On the other hand, in a curved spacetime, the presence of the
Hawking radiation can increase the uncertainty in quantum measurement. The
interplay of quantum correlation in the curved spacetime has become an
interesting arena for studying quantum uncertainty relations. Here we
demonstrate that the bounds of the entropic uncertainty relations, in the
presence of memory, can be formulated in terms of the Holevo quantity, which
limits how much information can be encoded in a quantum system. Specifically,
we considered two examples with Dirac fields, near the event horizon of a
Schwarzschild black hole, the Holevo bound provides a better bound than the
previous bound based on the mutual information. Furthermore, if the memory
moves away from the black hole, the difference between the total uncertainty
and the Holevo bound remains a constant, not depending on any property of the
black hole.

multivariate regression, where it is well known that failing to account for
this contamination can result in substantial bias in the parameter estimators.
The nature and degree of this effect on statistical inference is also
understood to crucially depend on the specific distributional properties of the
measurement error in question. When dealing with functional covariates,
measurement error has thus far been modelled as additive white noise over the
observation grid. Such a setting implicitly assumes that the error arises
purely at the discrete sampling stage, otherwise the model can only be viewed
in a weak (stochastic differential equation) sense, white noise not being a
second-order process. Departing from this simple distributional setting can
have serious consequences for inference, similar to the multivariate case, and
current methodology will break down. In this paper, we consider the case when
the additive measurement error is allowed to be a valid stochastic process. We
propose a novel estimator of the slope parameter in a functional linear model,
for scalar as well as functional responses, in the presence of this general
measurement error specification. The proposed estimator is inspired by the
multivariate regression calibration approach, but hinges on recent advances on
matrix completion methods for functional data in order to handle the nontrivial
(and unknown) error covariance structure. The asymptotic properties of the
proposed estimators are derived. We probe the performance of the proposed
estimator of slope using simulations and observe that it substantially improves
upon the spectral truncation estimator based on the erroneous observations,
i.e., ignoring measurement error. We also investigate the behaviour of the
estimators on a real dataset on hip and knee angle curves during a gait cycle.

(ii) torque effort \cite{mavrakis2016analysis} and (iii) impact force in case
of a collision during post-grasp manipulative actions. In these works, the main
assumption is that a manipulation task, i.e. trajectory of the centre of mass
(CoM) of an object is given. In addition, inertial properties of the object to
be manipulated is known. For example, a robot needs to pick an object located
at point A and place it at point B by moving it along a given path. Therefore,
the problem to be solved is to find an initial grasp pose that yields the
maximum kinematic manipulation capability, minimum joint effort and effective
mass along a given post-grasp trajectories. However, these objectives may
conflict in some cases making it impossible to obtain the best values for all
of them. We perform a series of experiments to show how different objectives
change as the grasping pose on an object alters. The experimental results
presented in this paper illustrate that these objectives are conflicting for
some desired post-grasp trajectories. This indicates that a detailed
multi-objective optimization is needed for properly addressing this problem in
a future work.

longevity of the connection between that ball and the fluid it breaks away
from, at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Scaling arguments based on the
processes observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to
the `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from
which it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds
numbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir
surface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal'
close to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball
and fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it
continues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself
depends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We
consider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface
tension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a
visco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid
moving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off
mechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a
different length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball
when submersed.

blazars. Looking for a possible connection between radio and gamma-ray emission
is a central issue for understanding the blazar physics, and various works were
dedicated to this topic. However, while a strong and significant correlation
was found between radio and gamma-ray emission in the 0.1-100 GeV energy range,
the connection between radio and very high energy (VHE, E>0.1 TeV) emission is
still elusive. The main reason is the lack of a homogeneous VHE sky coverage,
due to the operational mode of the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
With the present work we aim to quantify and assess the significance of the
possible connection between high-resolution radio emission, on milliarcsecond
scale, and GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission in blazars. For achieving our goal we
extract two large and unbiased blazar samples from the 1FHL and 2FHL Fermi
catalogs, above 10 GeV and 50 GeV, respectively. To investigate how the
correlation evolves as the gamma-ray energy increases, we perform the same
analysis by using the 0.1-300 GeV 3FGL gamma-ray energy fluxes. When we
consider the 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray energy range, we find a strong and
significant correlation for all of the blazar sub-classes. Conversely, when we
consider the gamma-ray emission above 10 GeV the correlation with the radio
emission vanishes, with the exception of the blazar sub-class of high
synchrotron peaked objects.

proportional to the logarithm of universe's volume, i.e. to the density itself
since $V\propto \rho^{-1}$. In the context of solid state physics, we
demonstrate that by only invoking standard matter with such a property, we are
able to frame the universe speed up in a suitable way, without invoking a dark
energy term by hand. Our model extends a recent class of dark energy paradigms
named \emph{logotropic} dark fluids and depends upon two free parameters,
namely $n$ and $B$. Within the Debye approximation, we find that $n$ and $B$
are related to the Gr\""uneisen parameter and the bulk modulus of crystals. We
thus show the main differences between our model and the logotropic scenario,
and we highlight the most relevant properties of our new equation of state on
the background cosmology. Discussions on both kinematics and dynamics of our
new model have been presented. We demonstrate that the $\Lambda$CDM model is
inside our approach, as limiting case. Comparisons with CPL parametrization
have been also reported in the text. Finally, a Monte Carlo analysis on the
most recent low-redshift cosmological data allowed us to place constraints on
$n$ and $B$. In particular, we found $n=-0.147^{+0.113}_{-0.107}$ and $B=3.54

results in the near-field regime. The force exhibits also a population-induced

and scale features. First we undertake to model the functional architecture of

retinal plane by introducing intrinsic variables orientation and scale. The
intrinsic variables constitute a fiber on each point of the retinal plane and
the set of receptive profiles of simple cells is located on the fiber. Each
receptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as a rotated Gabor
function derived from an uncertainty principle. The visual stimulus is lifted
in a 4-dimensional space, characterized by coordinate variables, position,
orientation and scale, through a linear filtering of the stimulus with Gabor
functions. Orientation preference maps are then obtained by mapping the
orientation value found from the lifting of a noise stimulus onto the
2-dimensional retinal plane. This corresponds to a Bargmann transform in the
reducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)=\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$ group. A
comparison will be provided with a previous model based on the Bargman
transform in the irreducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)$ group,
outlining that the new model is more physiologically motivated. Then we present
simulation results related to the construction of the orientation preference
map by using Gabor filters with different scales and compare those results to
the relevant neurophysiological findings in the literature.

techniques to automatically control drones for a variety of applications, none
have considered the problem of producing cinematographic camera motion in
real-time for shooting purposes. In this paper we present our approach to UAV
navigation for autonomous cinematography. The contributions of this research
are twofold: (i) we adapt virtual camera control techniques to UAV navigation;
(ii) we introduce a drone-independent platform for high-level user interactions
that integrates cinematographic knowledge. The results presented in this paper
demonstrate the capacities of our tool to capture live movie scenes involving
one or two moving actors.

responses in cells. Many bacteria are able to bias their apparently random
motion to produce a drift in the direction of the increasing chemoattractant
concentration. It has been recognized that the particular motility pattern
employed by moving bacteria has a direct impact on the efficiency of
chemotaxis. The linear theory of chemotaxis pioneered by de Gennes allows for
calculation of the drift velocity in small gradients for bacteria with basic
motility patterns. However, recent experimental data on several bacterial
species highlighted the motility pattern where the almost straight runs of
cells are interspersed with turning events leading to the reorientation of the
cell swimming directions with two distinct angles following in strictly
alternating order. In this manuscript we generalize the linear theory of
chemotaxis to calculate the chemotactic drift speed for the motility pattern of
bacteria with two turning angles. By using the experimental data on motility
parameters of {\em V. alginolyticus } bacteria we can use our theory to relate
the efficiency of chemotaxis and the size of bacterial cell body. The results
of this work can have a straightforward extension to address most general
motility patterns with alternating angles, speeds and durations of runs.

show that the boundary conditions for quadratic bulk dispersions are, in
general, specified by a $\mathbb{U}(2)$ matrix relating the wavefunction and
its derivatives normal to the surface. We give a general procedure to obtain
the surface spectra from these boundary conditions and derive them in specific
cases of bulk dispersion. We consider the role of global symmetries in the
boundary conditions and their effect on the surface spectrum. We point out
several interesting features of the surface spectra for different choices of
boundary conditions, such as a Mexican-hat shaped dispersion on the surface
normal to Weyl node separation. We find that the existence of bound states,
Fermi arcs, and the shape of their dispersion, depend on the choice of boundary

exactly overflow their Roche lobes and share a common convective envelope
(CCE). In the last twenty years, the long-term variations of their orbital
periods have been thought to depend on several mechanisms. Now, we suggest a
new mechanism: CCE-dominated mechanism. The CCE-dominated mechanism is found
based on our numerical result, especially at high mass ratios, that the orbital
periods (P) of contact binaries change very much with their fill-out factors
(f). Because f is taken as a measurement of the thickness of CCE, the physical
cause for the variation of P is a mass transfer between CCE and components.
Further, an f-dominated simplification model for this mechanism is introduced.
According to it, P may change in a long-term oscillation way with a similar
time scale of the thermal modulation, meanwhile q is decreasing slowly till the
two components merge. It could be also applied to explain the presence of
extremely short period, high mass ratio and deep contact binaries. Moreover,
the CCE-dominated mechanism should always work due to mass transfer and mass
loss both occurring via CCE. Therefor, the effect of CCE on the variations of
orbital periods may have been underestimated before.

they can even be noticeable at room temperature. Such quantum effects become
more relevant as the applied stress is increased, mainly for properties related
to out-of-plane atomic vibrations. The relevance of quantum dynamics in the

stress. For applied tensile stresses, we analyze the contribution of the
elastic energy to the internal energy of graphene. Results of PIMD simulations

evolutionary social systems. Previous research, although achieves promising
results, neglects one distinctive characteristic of social data, i.e.,
sequentiality. For example, the popularity of online content is generated over
time with sequential post streams of social media. To investigate the
sequential prediction of popularity, we propose a novel prediction framework
called Deep Temporal Context Networks (DTCN) by incorporating both temporal
context and temporal attention into account. Our DTCN contains three main
components, from embedding, learning to predicting. With a joint embedding
network, we obtain a unified deep representation of multi-modal user-post data
in a common embedding space. Then, based on the embedded data sequence over
time, temporal context learning attempts to recurrently learn two adaptive
temporal contexts for sequential popularity. Finally, a novel temporal
attention is designed to predict new popularity (the popularity of a new
user-post pair) with temporal coherence across multiple time-scales.
Experiments on our released image dataset with about 600K Flickr photos
demonstrate that DTCN outperforms state-of-the-art deep prediction algorithms,
with an average of 21.51% relative performance improvement in the popularity
prediction (Spearman Ranking Correlation).

astrometric and spin parameters, including the period derivative, timing

$R\approx26.4$ mag at the radio position in a single $R$-band observation with

strength, $4.0(4)\times10^7$ G. Its mean radio flux density of 160 $\mu$Jy

The scalar field, contrary to dark energy models, does not have a potential
whose role is to mimic a late-time cosmological constant. The late-time
acceleration of the expansion of the Universe can be easily obtained at the
background level in these models by appropriately choosing the coupling
functions appearing in the decomposition of the vierbeins for the baryonic and
dark matter metrics. We explicitly show how the concordance model can be
retrieved with negligible scalar kinetic energy. This requires the scalar
coupling functions to show variations of order unity during the accelerated
expansion era. This leads in turn to deviations of order unity for the
effective Newton constants and a fifth force that is of the same order as
Newtonian gravity, with peculiar features. The baryonic and dark matter
self-gravities are amplified although the gravitational force between baryons
and dark matter is reduced and even becomes repulsive at low redshift. This
slows down the growth of baryonic density perturbations on cosmological scales,
while dark matter perturbations are enhanced. In our local environment, the
upper bound on the time evolution of Newton's constant requires an efficient
screening mechanism that both damps the fifth force on small scales and
decouples the local value of Newton constant from its cosmological value. This
cannot be achieved by a quasi-static chameleon mechanism, and requires going
beyond the quasi-static regime and probably using derivative screenings, such
as Kmouflage or Vainshtein screening, on small scales.

is studied over a wide range of discharge parameters. An inductively coupled
diffused plasma, which creates an electrostatic trap to confine the negatively
charged grains, is used to form a large volume (or large aspect ratio) dusty
plasma at low pressure. For introducing the dust grains into the potential
well, a unique technique using a secondary DC glow discharge plasma is
employed. The dust dynamics is recorded in a 2-dimension (2D) plane at a given
axial location. The dust fluid exhibits wave like behavior at low pressure (p <
0.06 mbar) and high rf power (P > 3 W). The mixed motion, waves and vortices,
are observed at an intermediate gas pressure(p = 0.08 mbar) and low power (P <
3 W). Above the threshold value of gas pressure (p > 0.1 mbar), the clockwise
and anti-clockwise co-rotating vortex series are observed on the edges of the
dust cloud, whereas the particles in central region show the random motion.
These vortices are only observed above a threshold width of the dust cloud. The
streaming ions are considered the available free energy source to excite the
waves in dust grain medium. The occurrence of the co-rotating vortices is
understood on the basis of the charge gradient of dust particles which is
orthogonal to the gravity. The charge gradient is a consequence of the plasma
inhomogeneity from the central region to the outer edge of dust fluid. Since, a
vortex has the characteristic size in the dissipative medium; therefore, a
series of the co-rotating vortex on the both sides of dusty plasma is observed.
The experimental results on the vortex formation and its multiplicity are
compared to an available theoretical model and are found to be in close
agreement.

PEV of the rewired multilayer network becomes more localized. The framework
allows us to scrutinize structural and spectral properties of the networks at
various localization points during the rewiring process. We show that rewiring
only one-layer is enough to attain a multilayer network having a highly
localized PEV. Our investigation reveals that a single edge rewiring of the
optimized multilayer network can lead to the complete delocalization of a
highly localized PEV. This sensitivity in the localization behavior of PEV is
accompanied by a pair of almost degenerate eigenvalues. This observation opens
an avenue to gain a deeper insight into the origin of PEV localization of
networks. Furthermore, analysis of multilayer networks constructed using
real-world social and biological data show that the localization properties of
these real-world multilayer networks are in good agreement with the simulation
results for the model multilayer network. The study is relevant to applications

taxonomy here categorizes technologies in four typologies, in a broad analogy
with the ecology: 1) technological parasitism is a relationship between two
technologies T1 and T2 in a complex system S where one technology T1 benefits
from the interaction with T2, whereas T2 has a negative side from interaction
with T1; 2) technological commensalism is a relationship between two
technologies in S where one technology benefits from the other without
affecting it; 3) technological mutualism is a relationship in which each
technology benefits from the activity of the other within complex systems; 4)
technological symbiosis is a long-term interaction between two (or more)
technologies that evolve together in complex systems. This taxonomy
systematizes the typologies of interactive technologies within complex systems
and predicts their evolutionary pathways that generate stepwise coevolutionary
processes of complex systems of technology. This study here begins the process
of generalizing, as far as possible, critical typologies of interactive
technologies that explain the long-run evolution of technology. The theoretical
framework developed here opens the black box of the interaction between
technologies that affects, with different types of technologies, the
evolutionary pathways of complex systems of technology over time and space.
Overall, then, this new theoretical framework may be useful for bringing a new

  Nonlinear irregular wave generation in computational fluids dynamic (CFD)
solvers becomes important recently in naval fiels to better estimate the loads

long computational time for wave generation and the simulation is made almost
impossible without having enough computational power. And if the method is
based on linear wave theory, there is also question on occurence of nonlinear
phenomenon and the interaction between waves as the simulation goes. Therefore
dedicated nonlinear wave solvers with high computational speed are needed.

many researchers has started to work on developing new VR based social media.
For this purpose it is important to have an avatar of the users which look like
them to be easily generated by the devices which are accessible, such as mobile
phone. In this paper, we propose a novel method of recreating a 3D human face
model captured with a phone camera image or video data. The method focuses more
on model shape than texture in order to make the face recognizable. We detect
68 facial feature points and use them to separate a face into four regions. For
each area the best fitting models are found and are further morphed combined to
find the best fitting models for each area. These are then combined and further
morphed in order to restore the original facial proportions. We also present a
method of texturing the resulting model, where the aforementioned feature
points are used to generate a texture for the resulting model

  without a Local-Global Difference in Host Star Formation","16 pages, 3 figures, and 5 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aaa127",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is now established that there is a dependence of the luminosity of type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) on environment: SNe Ia in young, star-forming, metal-poor
stellar populations appear fainter after light-curve shape corrections than
those in older, passive, metal-rich environments. This is accounted for in
cosmological studies using a global property of the SN host galaxy, typically
the host galaxy stellar mass. However, recent low-redshift studies suggest that
this effect manifests itself most strongly when using the local star-formation
rate (SFR) at the SN location, rather than the global SFR or stellar mass of
the host galaxy. At high-redshift, such local SFRs are difficult to determine;
here, we show that an equivalent 'local' correction can be made by restricting
the SN Ia sample in globally star-forming host galaxies to a low-mass host
galaxy subset ($\le10^{10} M_{\odot}$). Comparing this sample of SNe Ia (in
locally star-forming environments) to those in locally passive host galaxies,
we find that SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments are $0.081\pm0.018$
mag fainter ($4.5\sigma$), consistent with the result reported by Rigault et
al. (2015), but our conclusion is based on a sample ~5 times larger over a
wider redshift range. This is a larger difference than when splitting the SN Ia
sample based on global host galaxy SFR or host galaxy stellar mass. This method
can be used in ongoing and future high-redshift SN surveys, where local SN Ia
environments are difficult to determine.

witnessed significant advances recently. In this review article, we report on
the utilization of IG methods to define measures of complexity in both
classical and, whenever available, quantum physical settings. A paradigmatic
example of a dramatic change in complexity is given by phase transitions (PTs).
Hence we review both global and local aspects of PTs described in terms of the
scalar curvature of the parameter manifold and the components of the metric
tensor, respectively. We also report on the behavior of geodesic paths on the
parameter manifold used to gain insight into the dynamics of PTs. Going
further, we survey measures of complexity arising in the geometric framework.
In particular, we quantify complexity of networks in terms of the Riemannian
volume of the parameter space of a statistical manifold associated with a given
network. We are also concerned with complexity measures that account for the
interactions of a given number of parts of a system that cannot be described in
terms of a smaller number of parts of the system. Finally, we investigate
complexity measures of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds that
arise from a probabilistic description of physical systems in the presence of
limited information. The Kullback-Leibler divergence, the distance to an
exponential family and volumes of curved parameter manifolds, are examples of
essential IG notions exploited in our discussion of complexity. We conclude by
discussing strengths, limits, and possible future applications of IG methods to
the physics of complexity.

  Program","Submitted to Journal of Research of the National Institute of

X-ray reflectometry experiments. The model of the (thin-film) samples is
typically constructed of discrete layers of different scattering-length
densities (SLD). Interlayer roughness is represented as an error-function
transition from one layer to the next. Previous versions of the software
truncated this error-function at the next interface. This strategy has the
advantage of preventing layers with unbounded effective extent, but it can also
result in SLD depth profiles that do not conform to the physical expectations
of the users (such as introducing sharp transitions) whenever the layer
roughness approaches the thickness of the layer. In this article we introduce a
new version of the software in which the option is provided to extend the
roughness of each layer over the entire structure; the resulting SLD profiles
often more closely resemble the physical models intended by the user. Most
importantly no sharp transitions are introduced by truncating the roughness,
when a smooth transition is often desired when adding rough layers together.

popularities change over time at various levels of temporal granularity. This
is influenced by temporal variations of public attentions or user activities.
For example, popularity patterns of street snap on Flickr are observed to
depict distinctive fashion styles at specific time scales, such as season-based
periodic fluctuations for Trench Coat or one-off peak in days for Evening
Dress. However, this fact is often overlooked by existing research of
popularity modeling. We present the first study to incorporate multiple
time-scale dynamics into predicting online popularity. We propose a novel
computational framework in the paper, named Multi-scale Temporalization, for
estimating popularity based on multi-scale decomposition and structural
reconstruction in a tensor space of user, post, and time by joint low-rank
constraints. By considering the noise caused by context inconsistency, we
design a data rearrangement step based on context aggregation as preprocessing
to enhance contextual relevance of neighboring data in the tensor space. As a
result, our approach can leverage multiple levels of temporal characteristics
and reduce the noise of data decomposition to improve modeling effectiveness.
We evaluate our approach on two large-scale Flickr image datasets with over 1.8
million photos in total, for the task of popularity prediction. The results
show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art popularity
prediction techniques, with a relative improvement of 10.9%-47.5% in terms of
prediction accuracy.
