are studied in the quasistatic approximation. The dielectric response is
described by the spectral function $G(n,x)$, which contains effects of the
concentration x (of metallic resp. superconductive particles) on the dielectric
function,and effects of the shape. The parameter n plays the role of the
depolarisation factor for dielectric materials, in metals it is a factor which
includes effects like shape, and a topology of the composite. There exists a
percolation transition at $ x_{c}= \frac{1}{3} $ which leads to a metallic-like
for the composite with the concentration $ x > x_{c}$. At low frequencies
divergence with frequency remains even when there are present dielectric
particles above the percolation concentration. In superconductor case the
spectral function $G(n,x)$ may include also Josephson junction effects. We
assume in both cases of composites two types of spheroidal particles, metal
(superconducting) ones and dielectric ones. A dielectric function is constant
in both cases for the dielectric material, and a dielectric function for the
metal and for the superconductor are used with well known form for metals and a
classical superconductor. A percolation transition at $ x_{c}$ leads to a
metallic-like absorption for the composite with $x>x_{c}$. Note that at low
frequencies divergence in frequency remains even when there are present
dielectric particles above $x_{c}$. Below the percolation threshold dielectric
properties are modified by metalic particles. We obtain at very low
temperatures and low concentrations x of the superconductor the effective
dielectric constant. The absorption part is zero in our simple case. The real
part of the dielectric function increases with the concentration of the
superconducting spheres. The frequency dependence is quadratic, it gives low
frequency tail.

By analytically solving for the retarded correlation functions, we clarify how
branch cuts arise generically from noncollective particle excitations, how they
interface with poles arising from collective hydrodynamic excitations, and to
what extent the appearance of poles remains at best an ambiguous signature for
the onset of fluid dynamic behavior. We observe that processes that are slower
than the hydrodynamic relaxation timescale can make a system that has already
reached fluid dynamic behavior to fall out of hydrodynamics at late times. In
addition, the analytical control over this model allows us to explicitly
demonstrate how the hydrodynamic gradient expansion of the correlation

cloud-shape markings, and notably long canines relative to skull size.
Estimates for population densities range from 0.58 to 6.53 individuals per 100
km2. Only 7 clouded leopards have been tracked via radio-collars, and home
range estimates range from 33.6-39.7 km2 for females and 35.5-43.5 km2 for
males. Most accounts describe clouded leopards as nocturnal, but radio
telemetry studies showed that clouded leopards have arrhythmic activity
patterns, with highest activity in the morning followed by evening crepuscular
hours. There has never been a targeted study of clouded leopard diet, but
observations show that they consume a variety of animals, including ungulates,
primates, and rodents. We encourage future study of their population density

understand the species and its ecological niche.

fundamental to networking evolution. Networks are built to accommodate certain
services at an expected scale. New applications and/or a significant increase
in scale require a rethinking of network mechanisms which results in new
deployments. Four decades-worth of iterations of this process have yielded the
Internet as we know it today, a common and shared global networking
infrastructure that delivers almost all services. I will further argue, using
brief historical case studies, that success of network mechanism deployments
often hinges on whether or not mechanism evolution follows the iterations of
this Cycle. Many have observed that this network, the Internet, has become
ossified and unable to change in response to new demands. In other words, after
decades of operation, the Service-Infrastructure Cycle has become stuck.
However, novel service requirements and scale increases continue to exert
significant pressure on this ossified infrastructure. The result, I will
conjecture, will be a fragmentation, the beginnings of which are evident today,
that will ultimately fundamentally change the character of the network
infrastructure. By ushering in a ManyNets world, this fragmentation will
lubricate the Service-Infrastructure Cycle so that it can continue to govern
the evolution of networking. I conclude this article with a brief discussion of
the possible implications of this emerging ManyNets world on networking
research.

Chebyshev polynomials to parameterize cosmic distances. In particular, we
demonstrate that building up rational Chebyshev polynomials significantly
reduces error propagations with respect to standard Taylor series. This
technique provides unbiased estimations of the cosmographic parameters and
performs significatively better than previous numerical approximations. To
figure this out, we compare rational Chebyshev polynomials with Pad\'e series.
In addition, we theoretically evaluate the convergence radius of (1,1)
Chebyshev rational polynomial and we compare it with the convergence radii of
Taylor and Pad\'e approximations. We thus focus on regions in which convergence
of Chebyshev rational functions is better than standard approaches. With this
recipe, as high-redshift data are employed, rational Chebyshev polynomials
remain highly stable and enable one to derive highly accurate analytical
approximations of Hubble's rate in terms of the cosmographic series. Finally,
we check our theoretical predictions by setting bounds on cosmographic
parameters through Monte Carlo integration techniques, based on the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We apply our technique to high-redshift cosmic
data, using the JLA supernovae sample and the most recent versions of Hubble
parameter and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. We find that
cosmography with Taylor series fails to be predictive with the aforementioned
data sets, while turns out to be much more stable using the Chebyshev approach.

nearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely

stage of merger-triggered accretion, in which case their host galaxies are
expected to show signs of an ongoing or recent merger. Using PSF subtraction
techniques, we decompose the images into host galaxy and AGN components at
rest-frame ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The ultraviolet is sensitive to
young stars, while the optical probes stellar mass. In the ultraviolet we image
at the BAL absorption trough wavelengths so as to decrease the contrast between
the quasar and host galaxy emission. We securely detect an extended source for
two of the four FeLoBALs in the rest-frame optical; a third host galaxy is
marginally detected. In the rest-frame UV we detect no host emission; this
constrains the level of unobscured star formation. Thus, the host galaxies have
observed properties that are consistent with those of non-BAL quasars with the
same nuclear luminosity, i.e., quiescent or moderately starforming elliptical
galaxies. However, we cannot exclude starbursting hosts that have the stellar
UV emission obscured by modest amounts of dust reddening. Thus, our findings
also allow the merger-induced young quasar scenario. For three objects, we

outsource bulk data to the cloud storage server. A client can later access her

the client uses for backup purposes and accesses less frequently. An untrusted
server can thus delete some of these archival data files in order to save some
space (and allocate the same to other clients) without being detected by the
client (data owner). Proofs of storage enable the client to audit her data
files uploaded to the server in order to ensure the integrity of those files.
In this work, we introduce one type of (selective) proofs of storage that we
call keyword-based delegable proofs of storage, where the client wants to audit
all her data files containing a specific keyword (e.g., ""important""). Moreover,
it satisfies the notion of public verifiability where the client can delegate
the auditing task to a third-party auditor who audits the set of files
corresponding to the keyword on behalf of the client. We formally define the
security of a keyword-based delegable proof-of-storage protocol. We construct
such a protocol based on an existing proof-of-storage scheme and analyze the
security of our protocol. We argue that the techniques we use can be applied
atop any existing publicly verifiable proof-of-storage scheme for static data.
Finally, we discuss the efficiency of our construction.

drawdown and drawup events based on assets governed by a geometric spectrally
negative L\'evy process. Drawdown and drawup refer to the differences between
the historical maximum and minimum of the asset price and its current value,
respectively. We consider four contracts. In the first contract, a protection
buyer pays a premium with a constant intensity $p$ until the drawdown of fixed
size occurs. In return, he/she receives a certain insured amount at the
drawdown epoch, which depends on the drawdown level at that moment. Next, the
insurance contract may expire earlier if a certain fixed drawup event occurs
prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of the
previous ones but with an additional cancellable feature that allows the
investor to terminate the contracts earlier. In these cases, a fee for early
stopping depends on the drawdown level at the stopping epoch. In this work, we
focus on two problems: calculating the fair premium $p$ for basic contracts and
finding the optimal stopping rule for the polices with a cancellable feature.
To do this, we use a fluctuation theory of L\'evy processes and rely on a
theory of optimal stopping.

from a filled sphere BEC into a thin shell through central density depletion.
We employ complementary analytic and numerical techniques in order to study

shells hosted by a range of trapping potentials. We identify concrete and
robust signatures of the evolution from filled to hollow structures and the
effects of the emergence of an inner boundary, inclusive of a dip in
breathing-mode-type collective mode frequencies and a restructuring of surface
mode structure across the transition. By extending our analysis to a
two-dimensional transition of a disk to a ring, we show that the collective
mode signatures are an essential feature of hollowing, independent of the
specific geometry. Finally, we relate our work to past and ongoing experimental

colloidal star polymers in the vicinity of their glass transition. With
increasing shear rate well beyond rheological yielding, a transition is found
from an initial bcc-dominated structure to an fcc-dominated one. This
crystal-to-crystal transition is not accompanied by intermediate melting but
occurs via a sudden reorganization of the crystal structure. Our results
provide a new avenue to tailor colloidal crystallization and crystal-to-crystal

Our goal is to find an efficient parallelization strategy for a fixed batch

algorithms in numerical linear algebra. We see $P$ processes as logically
divided into a $P_r \times P_c$ grid where the $P_r$ dimension is implicitly
responsible for model/domain parallelism and the $P_c$ dimension is implicitly
responsible for batch parallelism. In practice, the integrated matrix-based
parallel algorithm encapsulates these types of parallelism automatically. We
analyze the communication complexity and analytically demonstrate that the
lowest communication costs are often achieved neither with pure model nor with
pure data parallelism. We also show how the domain parallel approach can help
in extending the theoretical scaling limit of the typical batch parallel

gravitational wave makes them impossible to be resolved as individual
particles. While true, it is shown in this paper that a LIGO interferometric
detector also undergoes frequent and {\it discrete} quantum interactions with
an incident gravitational wave, in such a way as to allow the exchange of
energy and momentum between the wave and the detector. This opens the door to
another way of finding gravitons. The most basic form of an interaction is the
first order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser photon as it is
reflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave,
resulting in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on
whether the mirror is advancing towards (receding from) the photon before the
reflection. If e.g. a blueshift occurred, wave energy is absorbed and the
oscillation will be damped. It is suggested that such energy exchanging
interactions are responsible for the observed radiation reaction noise of LIGO
(although the more common way of calculating the same amplitude for this noise
is based on momentum considerations). Most importantly, in each interaction the
detector absorbs or emits wave energy in amounts far smaller than the standard
graviton energy $\hbar\omega$ where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the
gravitational wave. This sets a very tight upper limit on the quantization of
the wave energy, viz. it must be at least $\approx 10^{11}$ times below
$\hbar\omega$, independently of the value of $\omega$ itself.

a two-level Chebyshev polynomial filter based complementary subspace strategy
to: 1) compute a set of vectors that span the occupied subspace of the
Hamiltonian; 2) reduce subspace diagonalization to just partially occupied
states; and 3) obtain those states in an efficient, scalable manner via an

by new data, this result provides a powerful test of the theory of gravity at

the same RAR as brighter systems but with a much larger scatter which does not

with the External Field Effect in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) which
causes galaxies in strong external fields to deviate from the RAR. This
difference between $\Lambda$CDM and MOND offers a possible way to discriminate

HII regions and diffuse ionized gas to unprecedented depth. About 15% of the
ionized gas was undetected by previous observing campaigns. This newly detected
faint ionized gas is visible everywhere around the central merger, and shows
filamentary structure. We estimate diffuse gas fractions of about 60% in the
central field and 10% in the southern region. We are able to show that the
southern region contains a significantly different population of HII regions,
showing fainter luminosities. By comparing HII region luminosities with the HST
catalog of young star clusters in the central field, we estimate that there is
enough Lyman-continuum leakage in the merger to explain the amount of diffuse
ionized gas that we detect. We compare the Lyman-continuum escape fraction of
each HII region against ionization-parameter sensitive emission line ratios.
While we find no systematic trend between these properties, the most extreme
line ratios seem to be strong indicators of density bounded ionization.
Extrapolating the Lyman-continuum escape fractions to the southern region, we
conclude that just from the comparison of the young stellar populations to the
ionized gas there is no need to invoke other ionization mechanisms than
Lyman-continuum leaking HII regions for the diffuse ionized gas in the
Antennae.

these data as an extremely wide, low-resolution (R~20-80) IFU survey to slice
through the COSMOS field and obtain a large sample of ~4000 Lyman-$\alpha$
(Lya) emitters from z~2 to z~6 in 16 redshift slices (SC4K). We present new Lya
luminosity functions (LFs) covering a co-moving volume of ~10$^8$Mpc$^3$. SC4K
extensively complements ultra-deep surveys, jointly covering over 4 dex in Lya
luminosity and revealing a global (2.5<z<6) synergy LF with
$\alpha=-1.93\pm0.12$, $\log_{10}\Phi^*=-3.45^{+0.22}_{-0.29}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and
$\log_{10}L^*=42.93^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ erg/s. The Schechter component of the Lya
LF reveals a factor ~5 rise in $L^*$ and a ~7x decline in $\Phi^*$ from z~2 to
z~6. The data reveal an extra power-law (or Schechter) component above
L~10$^{43.3}$ erg/s at z~2.2-3.5 and we show that it is partially driven by
X-ray and radio AGN, as their Lya LF resembles the excess. The power-law
component vanishes and/or is below our detection limits above z>3.5, likely
linked with the evolution of the AGN population. The Lya luminosity density
rises by a factor ~2 from z~2 to z~3 but is then found to be roughly constant
(~$1.1\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$) to z~6, despite the ~0.7 dex drop
in UV luminosity density. The Lya/UV luminosity density ratio rises from
$4\pm1$% to $30\pm6$% from z~2.2 to z~6. Our results imply a rise of a factor
of ~2 in the global ionisation efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) and a factor
~$4\pm1$ in the Lya escape fraction from z~2 to z~6, hinting for evolution in
both the typical burstiness/stellar populations and even more so in the typical
ISM conditions allowing Ly$\alpha$ photons to escape.

majority of our sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively
rapidly, over $1{-}2$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the
low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At $z > 1$ we
also find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with
quenching timescales of $< 1$ Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback.
Finally, at $z < 1$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly
than they rise, over $>3$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of
diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated
evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at
higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a
natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in
quenching physics with stellar mass. We find $61\pm8$ per cent of $z > 1.5$

the phenomenology of critical collapse dramatically. The magnetic sector
features both type I and type II critical collapse, with universal critical
solutions. In contrast, in the general system type I disappears and the
critical behavior at the threshold between dispersal and black hole formation
is always type II. We obtain values of the mass scaling and echoing exponents
close to those observed in the magnetic sector, however we find some
indications that the critical solution differs from the purely magnetic
discretely self-similar attractor and exact self-similarity and universality
might be lost. The additional ""type III"" critical phenomenon in the magnetic
sector, where black holes form on both sides of the threshold but the
Yang-Mills potential is in different vacuum states and there is a mass gap,
also disappears in the general system. We support our dynamical numerical
simulations with calculations in linear perturbation theory; for instance, we
compute quasi-normal modes of the unstable attractor (the Bartnik-McKinnon

necessary to reproduce the correct Schwinger-Keldysh correlators arise
naturally. Secondly, the Schwinger-Keldysh difference operators are
systematically dressed by the ghost bilinears, which turn out to be necessary

bridges the gap between normal star-forming galaxies and Ultra-Luminous
Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), which are thought to be triggered by different star
formation modes. Considering the $\rm SFE'$ as the SFR and the $L'_{\rm CO}$
ratio, our data show a continuous and smooth increment as a function of
infrared luminosity (or star formation rate) with a scatter about 0.5 dex,
instead of a steep jump with a bimodal behaviour. This result is due to the use
of a sample with a much larger range of sSFR/sSFR$_{\rm ms}$ using LIRGs, with
luminosities covering the range between normal and ULIRGs. We conclude that the
main parameters controlling the scatter of the SFE in star-forming galaxies are
the systematic uncertainty of the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ conversion factor, the gas

imaging the raw visibilities acquired by RI telescopes will become
significantly more computationally challenging, particularly in terms of data
storage and computational cost. Current RI imaging methods, such as CLEAN, its
variants, and compressive sensing approaches (sparse regularisation), have
yielded excellent reconstruction fidelity. However, scaling these methods to
big-data remains difficult if not impossible in some cases. All
state-of-the-art methods in RI imaging lack the ability to process data streams
as they are acquired during the data observation stage. Such approaches are
referred to as online processing methods. We present an online sparse
regularisation methodology for RI imaging. Image reconstruction is performed
simultaneously with data acquisition, where observed visibilities are
assimilated into the reconstructed image as they arrive and then discarded.
Since visibilities are processed online, good reconstructions are recovered
much faster than standard (offline) methods which cannot start until the data
acquisition stage completes. Moreover, the online method provides additional
computational savings and, most importantly, dramatically reduces data storage
requirements. Theoretically, the reconstructed images are of the same fidelity
as those recovered by the equivalent offline approach and, in practice, very
similar reconstruction fidelity is achieved. We anticipate online imaging
techniques, as proposed here, will be critical in scaling RI imaging to the

passage after accretion, and scale factor, virial mass, and maximum circular
velocity at accretion. Our five-property classifier identifies disrupted
subhalos in the FIRE simulations with an $85\%$ out-of-bag classification
score. We predict surviving subhalo populations in DMO simulations of the FIRE
host halos, finding excellent agreement with the hydrodynamic results; in
particular, our classifier outperforms DMO zoom-in simulations that include the
gravitational potential of the central galactic disk in each hydrodynamic
simulation, indicating that it captures both the dynamical effects of a central
disk and additional baryonic physics. We also predict surviving subhalo
populations for a suite of DMO zoom-in simulations of MW-mass host halos,
finding that baryons impact each system consistently and that the predicted
amount of subhalo disruption is larger than the host-to-host scatter among the
subhalo populations. Although the small size and specific baryonic physics
prescription of our training set limits the generality of our results, our work
suggests that machine-learning classification algorithms trained on
hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations can efficiently predict realistic subhalo
populations.

a statistical scaling relation between the optical properties and HI mass. This
allows us to compute the abundance and clustering properties of HI-selected
galaxies and compare with data from the ALFALFA survey. We apply an MCMC-based
statistical analysis to constrain the free parameters related to the scaling
relation. The resulting best-fit scaling relation identifies massive HI
galaxies primarily with optically faint blue centrals, consistent with
expectations from galaxy formation models. We compare the HI-stellar mass
relation predicted by our model with independent observations from matched
HI-optical galaxy samples, finding reasonable agreement. As a further
application, we make some preliminary forecasts for future observations of HI

Higgs and the Ricci scalar can source higher derivative operators, which may
change the predictions of Higgs inflation. A variant, called critical Higgs
inflation, employs the near-criticality of the top mass to introduce an
inflection point in the potential and lower drastically the value of $\xi$. We
here study whether critical Higgs inflation can occur even if the
pre-inflationary initial conditions do not satisfy the slow-roll behaviour
(retaining translation and rotation symmetries). A positive answer is found:
inflation turns out to be an attractor and therefore no fine-tuning of the
initial conditions is necessary. A very large initial Higgs time-derivative (as
compared to the potential energy density) is compensated by a moderate increase
in the initial field value. These conclusions are reached by solving the exact
Higgs equation without using the slow-roll approximation. This also allows us
to treat consistently the inflection point, where the standard slow-roll
approximation breaks down. Here we make use of an approach that is independent
of the UV completion of gravity, by taking initial conditions that always
involve sub-planckian energies.

layers from the view at almost all wavelengths. However, because gaseous
absorptions are spectrally selective, some narrow spectral intervals are
relatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these intervals
(called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once
gas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows
depends on the way the far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off.
We know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same
cut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 {\mu}m. This discrepancy is
generally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off
description for this specific window. This window is relatively transparent and
surface may have specific spectral signatures that could be detected. Thus, a
good knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better
understand what causes the difference between the 2 {\mu}m window and the other
windows. In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in
occultation observed with VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard
Cassini, around the 2 {\mu}m window. Data shows an absorption feature that
participates to the shape of this window. Our atmospheric model fits well the
VIMS data at 2 {\mu}m with the same cut-off than for the other windows,
provided an additional absorption is introduced in the middle of the window
around ~2.065 {\mu}m. It explains well the discrepancy between the cut-off used
at 2 {\mu}m, and we show that a gas with a fairly constant mixing ratio,
possibly ethane, may be the cause of this absorption. Finally, we studied the
impact of this absorption on the retrieval of the surface reflectivity and

considered in the literature, and Gaussian the overwhelmingly typical case. It
is also necessary to determine the number of mixture components \emph{a
priori}, and much art is devoted to this. Here, we introduce \emph{topological
mixture estimation}, a completely nonparametric and computationally efficient
solution to the one-dimensional problem where mixture components need only be
unimodal. We repeatedly perturb the unimodal decomposition of Baryshnikov and
Ghrist to produce a topologically and information-theoretically optimal
unimodal mixture. We also detail a smoothing process that optimally exploits
topological persistence of the unimodal category in a natural way when working
directly with sample data. Finally, we illustrate these techniques through
examples.

the time evolution of quantum states, when driven through a region of small
gap. The AIA originates from the Kibble-Zurek theory applied to continuous
quantum phase transitions. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism was developed to predict
the power-law scaling of the defect density across a continuous quantum phase
transition. Instead here, we quantify the accuracy of the AIA via the trace
norm distance with respect to the exact evolved state. As expected, we find
that for short times/fast protocols, the AIA outperforms the simple adiabatic
approximation. However, for large times/slow protocols, the situation is
actually reversed and the AIA provides a worse approximation. Nevertheless, we
found a variation of the AIA that can perform better than the adiabatic one.
This counter-intuitive modification consists in crossing twice the region of
small gap. Our findings are illustrated by several examples of driven closed

would have on standard-energy SNe associated with 15-20Msun blue or red
supergiant (BSG/RSG) stars. We use a combination of Eulerian grey
radiation-hydrodynamics and non-LTE steady-state radiative transfer to study
their dynamical, photometric, and spectroscopic properties. Adopting magnetar
fields of 1, 3.5, 7 x 10^14G and rotational energies of 0.4, 1, and 3 x
10^51erg, we produce bolometric light curves with a broad maximum covering
50-150d and a magnitude of 10^43-10^44erg/s. The spectra at maximum light are
analogous to those of standard SNe II-P but bluer. Although the magnetar energy
is channelled roughly in equal proportion between SN kinetic energy and SN
luminosity, the latter may be boosted by a factor 10-100 compared to a standard
SN II. This influence breaks the observed relation between brightness and
expansion rate of standard Type II SNe. Magnetar energy injection also delays
recombination and may even cause re-ionization, with a reversal in photospheric
temperature and velocity. Depositing the magnetar energy in a narrow mass shell
at the ejecta base leads to the formation of a dense shell at a few 1000km/s,
which causes a light-curve bump at the end of the photospheric phase.
Depositing this energy over a broad range of mass in the inner ejecta, to mimic
the effect of multi-dimensional fluid instabilities, prevents the formation of
a dense shell and produces an earlier-rising and smoother light curve. The
magnetar influence on the SN radiation is generally not visible prior to
20-30d, during which one may discern a BSG from a RSG progenitor. We propose a
magnetar model for the super-luminous Type II SN OGLE-SN14-073.

  Four policies are proposed in schedGPU to handle applications that are
waiting to access the GPU, two of which account for priorities. The feasibility
of schedGPU is validated on three real-world applications. The key observation
is that a performance gain is achieved.
  For single applications, a gain of over 10 times, as measured by GPU

systems --parts, aspects, or groups of them-- may extract important functional
benefits from operating at the edge of instability, halfway between order and
disorder, i.e. in the vicinity of the critical point of a phase transition.
Criticality has been argued to provide biological systems with an optimal
balance between robustness against perturbations and flexibility to adapt to
changing conditions, as well as to confer on them optimal computational
capabilities, huge dynamical repertoires, unparalleled sensitivity to stimuli,
etc. Criticality, with its concomitant scale invariance, can be conjectured to
emerge in living systems as the result of adaptive and evolutionary processes
that, for reasons to be fully elucidated, select for it as a template upon
which higher layers of complexity can rest. This hypothesis is very suggestive
as it proposes that criticality could constitute a general and common
organizing strategy in biology stemming from the physics of phase transitions.
However, despite its thrilling implications, this is still in its embryonic
state as a well-founded theory and, as such, it has elicited some healthy
skepticism. From the experimental side, the advent of high-throughput
technologies has created new prospects in the exploration of biological
systems, and empirical evidence in favor of criticality has proliferated, with
examples ranging from endogenous brain activity and gene-expression patterns,
to flocks of birds and insect-colony foraging, to name but a few...

important, also the observed trend with metallicity, which agrees well with the
predictions from AGB evolution modelling. While further observational evidences

has been resolved up to 10 kpc. This target represents a unique test case to
study QSO 'feedback in action' at the peak epoch of AGN-galaxy coevolution. The
QSO has been detected in the CO(5-4) transition and in the 1.3mm continuum, at
~30 and ~20 {\sigma} significance respectively, with both emissions confined in
the central (<4 kpc) radius area. Our analysis suggests the presence of a fast
rotating molecular disc (v~400 km/s) on very compact scales, and well inside
the galaxy extent seen in the rest-frame optical light (~10 kpc, as inferred
from the LUCI data). Adding available measurements in additional two CO
transitions, CO(2-1) and CO(3-2), we could derive a total gas mass of
~10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$, thanks to a critical assessment of CO excitation and the
comparison with Rayleigh-Jeans continuum estimate. This translates into a very
low gas fraction (<5%) and depletion time scales of 40-75 Myr, reinforcing the
result of atypical gas consumption conditions in XID2028, possibly due to
feedback effects on the host galaxy. Finally, we also detect at ~5{\sigma} the

galaxy-scale molecular outflow, spatially coincident with the ionised gas
outflow. XID2028 represents therefore a unique case where the measurement of
total outflowing mass (~500-800 M$_\odot$/yr) including the molecular and

excitations that exhibit remarkable mobility restrictions and a robust ground
state degeneracy (GSD) which can increase exponentially with system size. In
this paper, we present a generic lattice construction (in three dimensions) for
a generalized X-cube model of fracton order, where the mobility restrictions of
the subdimensional particles inherit the geometry of the lattice. This helps
explain a previous result that lattice curvature can produce a robust GSD, even
on a manifold with trivial topology. We provide explicit examples to show that
the (zero temperature) phase of matter is sensitive to the lattice geometry. In
one example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles to small
loops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting
phase is equivalent to (3+1)-dimensional toric code. However, the phase is
sensitive to more than just lattice curvature; different lattices without
curvature (e.g. cubic or stacked kagome lattices) also result in different
phases of matter, which are separated by phase transitions. Unintuitively
however, according to a previous definition of phase [Chen, Gu, Wen 2010], even
just a rotated or rescaled cubic lattice results in different phases of matter,
which motivates us to propose a new and coarser definition of phase for gapped
ground states and fracton order. The new equivalence relation between ground
states is given by the composition of a local unitary transformation and a
quasi-isometry (which can rotate and rescale the lattice); equivalently, ground
states are in the same phase if they can be adiabatically connected by varying
both the Hamiltonian and the positions of the degrees of freedom (via a
quasi-isometry). In light of the importance of geometry, we further propose
that fracton orders should be regarded as a geometric order.

$\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_V$ would be enough to predict values of Yukawa couplings
for other fermions and for the $H$ and $A$ scalars. (ii) In the case that the
scalar potential has a softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry, the second Higgs doublet
must be light, but if there is hard breaking of the symmetry, the second Higgs
doublet can be much heavier than the electroweak scale and still allow the

such electronic systems for optical interactions would appear to arise from the
discrete nature of the electronic transitions and from the limited ionization

shaping lengthens the diffraction lifetime of the wavepackets in exchange for
increasing their spatial spreads. Finally, we study the spontaneous radiative
transitions of these excited states, examining the influence of the wavepacket
shape and size on the radiation rate of the excited state. We observe that the
rate of radiative capture is primarily limited by the diffraction lifetime of
the wavepacket. The approach proposed in this work could have applications

and their adiabatic phase analytically continued to the complexified time

is also calculated by switching the background field on adiabatically, allowing
it to act for a very long time, and then adiabatically switching it off again.
In both the uniform electric field and de Sitter cases the particles created
while the field is switched on are verified to be real, in the sense that they
persist in the final asymptotic flat zero-field region. In the de Sitter case
there is an interesting residual dependence of the rate on how the de Sitter

coloring of $V$ such that the neighborhood of each vertex contains a vertex
whose color differs from the color of any other vertex in that neighborhood.
Bounds on CF-chromatic numbers have been studied both for general graphs and
for intersection graphs of geometric shapes. In this paper we obtain such
bounds for several classes of string graphs, i.e., intersection graphs of
curves in the plane:
  (i) We provide a general upper bound of $O(\chi(G)^2 \log n)$ on the
CF-chromatic number of any string graph $G$ with $n$ vertices in terms of the
classical chromatic number $\chi(G)$. This result stands in contrast to general
graphs where the CF-chromatic number can be $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ already for
bipartite graphs.
  (ii) For some central classes of string graphs, the CF-chromatic number is as
large as $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, which is the upper bound for any graph even in the
non-geometric context. For several such classes (e.g., intersection graphs of
frames) we prove a tight bound of $\Theta(\log n)$ with respect to the notion
of $k$-CF-coloring (in which the punctured neighborhood of each vertex contains
a color that appears at most $k$ times), for a small constant $k$.
  (iii) We obtain a general upper bound on the $k$-CF-chromatic number of
arbitrary hypergraphs: Any hypergraph with $m$ hyperedges can be $k$-CF colored
with $\tilde{O}(m^{\frac{1}{k+1}})$ colors. This bound, which extends a bound
of Pach and Tardos (2009), is tight for some string graphs, up to a logarithmic
factor.
  (iv) Our fourth result concerns circle graphs in which coloring problems are
motivated by VLSI designs. We prove a tight bound of $\Theta(\log n)$ on the
CF-chromatic number of circle graphs, and an upper bound of $O(\log^{3} n)$ for
a wider class that contains circle graphs, namely, intersection graphs of

$\sigma_k$-curvatures of the manifold. We search solutions in a conformal class
for a compact manifold. Using the existing results on the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe
problem, we describe some cases in which they can be extended to this new
problem. This requires to study the concavity of some polynomial. We do it in
two ways: regarding the concavity of an entire root of this polynomial, which
is connected to algebraic properties of the polynomial; and seeking
analytically a concavifying function. This gives several cases in which a
conformal solution exists. At last we show an implicit function theorem in the
case of a manifold with negative scalar curvature, and find a conformal
solution when the Lovelock theories are close to General Relativity.

spontaneous emission by a free electron through shaping the electron
wavefunction. On one hand, shaping the electron wavefunction changes the
respective charge and current densities of the electron. On the other hand,
spontaneous emission of an electron is an incoherent process and can often be
insensitive to the shape of the electron wavefunction. In this work, we arrive
at an affirmative answer examining Bremsstrahlung radiation by free electron
superposition states. We find that the radiation can be markedly different from
an incoherent sum of the radiations of the two states because of interference
of the radiation amplitudes from the two components of the superposition. The
ability to control free electron spontaneous emission via interference may
eventually result in a new degree of control over radiation over the entire
electromagnetic spectrum in addition to the ability to deterministically
introduce quantum behavior into normally classical light emission processes.

regression model that minimizes errors by selecting a small number of
explanatory variables. Once a model is built, various statistical tests and
diagnostics are conducted to validate the model and to determine whether the
regression assumptions are met. Most traditional approaches require human
decisions at this step. For example, the user adding or removing a variable
until a satisfactory model is obtained. However, this trial-and-error strategy
cannot guarantee that a subset that minimizes the errors while satisfying all

programming. The proposed model minimizes mean squared errors while ensuring
that the majority of the important regression assumptions are met. We also
propose an efficient constraint to approximate the constraint for the
coefficient t-test. When no subset satisfies all of the considered regression
assumptions, our model provides an alternative subset that satisfies most of

solutions (i.e., satisfying more regression assumptions) compared to the

significant promise in de- tecting files that are similar at the byte level.
This is very useful for digital forensic investigators, who are regularly faced
with the problem of searching through a seized device for pertinent data. A
common scenario is where an investigator is in possession of a collection of
""known-illegal"" files (e.g. a collection of child abuse material) and wishes to
find whether copies of these are stored on the seized device. Approximate
matching addresses shortcomings in traditional hashing, which can only find
identical files, by also being able to deal with cases of merged files,
embedded files, partial files, or if a file has been changed in any way.
  Most approximate matching algorithms work by comparing pairs of files, which
is not a scalable approach when faced with large corpora. This paper
demonstrates the effectiveness of using a ""Hierarchical Bloom Filter Tree""

collection-against-collection matching, with a specific focus on the MRSH-v2

sets of $F$ some $q$ intersect. The celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem of Alon and
Kleitman asserts that any family of compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that
satisfies the $(p,q)$-property for some $q \geq d+1$, can be pierced by a fixed
number $f_d(p,q)$ of points. The minimum such piercing number is denoted by
$HD_d(p,q)$. Already in 1957, Hadwiger and Debrunner showed that whenever
$q>\frac{d-1}{d}p+1$ the piercing number is $HD_d(p,q)=p-q+1$; no exact values
of $HD_d(p,q)$ were found ever since.
  While for an arbitrary family of compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d
\geq 2$, a $(p,2)$-property does not imply a bounded piercing number, such
bounds were proved for numerous specific families. The best-studied among them
is axis-parallel rectangles in the plane. Wegner and (independently) Dol'nikov
used a $(p,2)$-theorem for axis-parallel rectangles to show that
$HD_{\mathrm{rect}}(p,q)=p-q+1$ holds for all $q>\sqrt{2p}$. These are the only
values of $q$ for which $HD_{\mathrm{rect}}(p,q)$ is known exactly.
  In this paper we present a general method which allows using a
$(p,2)$-theorem as a bootstrapping to obtain a tight $(p,q)$-theorem, for
families with Helly number 2, even without assuming that the sets in the family
are convex or compact. To demonstrate the strength of this method, we obtain a
significant improvement of an over 50 year old result by Wegner and Dol'nikov.
Namely, we show that $HD_{\mathrm{d-box}}(p,q)=p-q+1$ holds for all $q > c'
\log^{d-1} p$, and in particular, $HD_{\mathrm{rect}}(p,q)=p-q+1$ holds for all
$q \geq 7 \log_2 p$ (compared to $q \geq \sqrt{2p}$ of Wegner and Dol'nikov).
  In addition, for several classes of families, we present improved
$(p,2)$-theorems, some of which can be used as a bootstrapping to obtain tight

the existence of a near optimal packing of any family $\mathcal H$ of bounded

degree condition is best possible.
  Here a graph is separable if it has a sublinear separator whose removal
results in a set of components of sublinear size. Equivalently, the
separability condition can be replaced by that of having small bandwidth. Thus
our result can be viewed as a version of the bandwidth theorem of B\""ottcher,
Schacht and Taraz in the setting of approximate decompositions.
  More precisely, let $\delta_k$ be the infimum over all $\delta\ge 1/2$
ensuring an approximate $K_k$-decomposition of any sufficiently large regular
$n$-vertex graph $G$ of degree at least $\delta n$. Now suppose that $G$ is an

  If the $H_i$ are bipartite, then $r\geq (1/2+o(1))n$ is sufficient. In
particular, this yields an approximate version of the tree packing conjecture

find a small subset $S \subseteq P$ such that the convex hull of $S$
approximately contains $P$. More formally, every point in $P$ is within
distance $\epsilon$ from the convex hull of $S$. Such a subset $S$ is called an
$\epsilon$-hull. Computing an $\epsilon$-hull is an important problem in
computational geometry, machine learning, and approximation algorithms.
  In many real world applications, the set $P$ is too large to fit in memory.
We consider the streaming model where the algorithm receives the points of $P$
sequentially and strives to use a minimal amount of memory. Existing streaming
algorithms for computing an $\epsilon$-hull require $O(\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$
space, which is optimal for a worst-case input. However, this ignores the
structure of the data. The minimal size of an $\epsilon$-hull of $P$, which we
denote by $\text{OPT}$, can be much smaller. A natural question is whether a
streaming algorithm can compute an $\epsilon$-hull using only $O(\text{OPT})$
space.
  We begin with lower bounds that show that it is not possible to have a
single-pass streaming algorithm that computes an $\epsilon$-hull with
$O(\text{OPT})$ space. We instead propose three relaxations of the problem for
which we can compute $\epsilon$-hulls using space near-linear to the optimal
size. Our first algorithm for points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that arrive in
random-order uses $O(\log n\cdot \text{OPT})$ space. Our second algorithm for
points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ makes $O(\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ passes before
outputting the $\epsilon$-hull and requires $O(\text{OPT})$ space. Our third
algorithm for points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any fixed dimension $d$ outputs an
$\epsilon$-hull for all but $\delta$-fraction of directions and requires
$O(\text{OPT} \cdot \log \text{OPT})$ space.

biological tissues using diffusion-weighted MRI. It is however the bottleneck
of microstructural MRI. Beyond the complexity of diffusion, the current
development is hindered by the fact that biophysical models heavily rely on
diffusion-specific properties of diverse cellular compartments that are still
unknown and must be measured in vivo. Obtaining such parameters by
straightforward fitting is hindered by the degenerated landscape of the
likelihood functions, in particular, the signal obtained for multiple diffusion
directions and moderate diffusion weighting strength is not enough to estimate
these parameters: different parameter constellations explain the signal equally
well. The aim of this study is to measure the central parameter of white matter
models, namely the intra-axonal water diffusivity in the normal human brain.
Proper estimation of this parameter is complicated due to (i) the presence of
both intra- and extra-axonal water compartments and (ii) the orientation
dispersion of axons. Our measurement involves an efficient suppression of
extra-axonal space and all cellular processes oriented outside a narrow cone
around the principal fiber direction. This is achieved using a planar water
mobility filter -- a strong diffusion weighting that suppresses signal from all
molecules that are mobile in the plane transverse to the fiber bundle.
Following the planar filter, the diffusivity in the remaining compartment is
measured using linear and isotropic weighting. We find the specifically
averaged intra-axonal diffusivity $D_0 = 2.25\pm 0.03{\,\rm \mu m^2/ms}$ for
the timing of the applied gradients. Extrapolation to the infinite diffusion
time gives $D_\infty \approx 2.0{\,\rm \mu m^2/ms}$. This result imposes a
strong limitation on the parameter selection for biophysical modeling of

a decoupled regime where the vortices are dragged a short distance within a
pinning site, an intermediate coupling regime where vortices in neighboring
pinning sites exchange places, an intermediate trapping regime where individual
vortices are dragged longer distances and exchange modes of vortices occur in
the surrounding pins, an intermittent multiple trapping regime where the trap
switches between capturing one or two vortices, and a strong couping regime in
which the trap permanently captures and drags two vortices. In some regimes we
observe the counterintuitive behavior that slow moving traps couple less
strongly to vortices than faster moving traps; however, the fastest moving
traps are generally decoupled. The different phases can be characterized by the
distances the vortices are displaced and the force fluctuations exerted on the
trap. We find different types of stick-slip motion depending on whether
vortices are moving into and out of pinning sites, undergoing exchange, or
performing correlated motion induced by vortices outside of the trap. Our
results are general to the manipulation of other types of particle-based

two equal-mass pairs where the primary star is more active. The stellar
rotation periods are also anomalously fast for stars with elevated flare

tasks based on the iterative projections in the L2 space with probability
measure reflecting the stochastic property of input signals. The proposed
learning algorithm exploits the reproducing kernel of the so-called dictionary
subspace, based on the fact that any finite-dimensional space of functions has
a reproducing kernel characterized by the Gram matrix. The L2-space geometry
provides the best decorrelation property in principle. The proposed learning
paradigm is significantly different from the conventional kernel-based learning
paradigm in two senses: (i) the whole space is not a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space and (ii) the minimum mean squared error estimator gives the best
approximation of the desired nonlinear function in the dictionary subspace. It
preserves efficiency in computing the inner product as well as in updating the
Gram matrix when the dictionary grows. Monotone approximation, asymptotic
optimality, and convergence of the proposed algorithm are analyzed based on the
variable-metric version of adaptive projected subgradient method. Numerical
examples show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for real data over a
variety of methods including the extended Kalman filter and many batch
machine-learning methods such as the multilayer perceptron.

first studied. It is found that the transition momentum of proton is sensitive
to the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio as well as the energetic photon production in

\emph{ground truth}. But these labels often come from noisy crowdsourcing
platforms, like Amazon Mechanical Turk. Practitioners typically collect
multiple labels per example and aggregate the results to mitigate noise (the
classic crowdsourcing problem). Given a fixed annotation budget and unlimited
unlabeled data, redundant annotation comes at the expense of fewer labeled
examples. This raises two fundamental questions: (1) How can we best learn from
noisy workers? (2) How should we allocate our labeling budget to maximize the

labels and worker quality from noisy crowd-sourced data. The alternating
minimization proceeds in rounds, estimating worker quality from disagreement
with the current model and then updating the model by optimizing a loss
function that accounts for the current estimate of worker quality. Unlike
previous approaches, even with only one annotation per example, our algorithm
can estimate worker quality. We establish a generalization error bound for
models learned with our algorithm and establish theoretically that it's better
to label many examples once (vs less multiply) when worker quality is above a

the size scaling of the energy gain due to the pairing fields and the

Similarly, the optimized pairing amplitudes (responsible for opening the spin

corroborated by the application of one and two Lanczos steps to the gapless and

appropriately linked together, can actuate into a diverse array of three

dimension. It was recently shown by [Sidiropoulos & Sridhar, SoCG 2017] that
several problems admit improved solutions when the input is a pointset in
Euclidean space with fractal dimension smaller than the ambient dimension. In
this paper we prove nearly-matching lower bounds, thus establishing
nearly-optimal bounds for various problems as a function of the fractal
dimension.
  More specifically, we show that for any set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space, of fractal dimension $\delta\in (1,d)$, for any $\epsilon >0$
and $c\geq 1$, any $c$-spanner must have treewidth at least $\Omega \left(
\frac{n^{1-1/(\delta - \epsilon)}}{c^{d-1}} \right)$, matching the previous
upper bound. The construction used to prove this lower bound on the treewidth
of spanners can also be used to derive lower bounds on the running time of
algorithms for various problems, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We
provide two prototypical results of this type. For any $\delta \in (1,d)$ and
any $\epsilon >0$ we show that:
  1) $d$-dimensional Euclidean TSP on $n$ points with fractal dimension at most
$\delta$ cannot be solved in time $2^{O\left(n^{1-1/(\delta - \epsilon)}
\right)}$. The best-known upper bound is $2^{O(n^{1-1/\delta} \log n)}$.
  2) The problem of finding $k$-pairwise non-intersecting $d$-dimensional unit
balls/axis parallel unit cubes with centers having fractal dimension at most
$\delta$ cannot be solved in time $f(k)n^{O \left(k^{1-1/(\delta -
\epsilon)}\right)}$ for any computable function $f$. The best-known upper bound
is $n^{O(k^{1-1/\delta} \log n)}$.
  The above results nearly match previously known upper bounds from
[Sidiropoulos & Sridhar, SoCG 2017], and generalize analogous lower bounds for
the case of ambient dimension due to [Marx & Sidiropoulos, SoCG 2014].

some of the most compact dSphs without suffering the resolution limitation from
N-body simulations that conventional methods have. We find that the strongest

additionally forecast the constraining power of a few dSph candidates that do

the bounds if they are confirmed to be highly dark matter dominated systems.
Our results demonstrate that compact dSphs provide important constraints on
sterile neutrino dark matter that are comparable to other methods using as
Milky Way satellite counts. In particular, if more compact systems are

significantly higher clump masses (M_{clump}), bolometric luminosities
(L_{bol}), luminosity-to-mass ratios (L_{bol}/M_{clump}) and peak H_2 column

been detected within the youngest quiescent clump (i.e.,70um weak) in this

M_{clump},L_{bol},L_{bol}/M_{clump} and N_{H_2},approaching 90% in some
cases(uchii regions=93+-3%;masers=86+-4%;hchii regions=100%). This high
detection rate suggests that outflows are ubiquitous phenomena of massive star
formation. The mean outflow mass entrainment rate implies a mean accretion rate
of ~10^{-4}M_\odot\,yr^{-1}, in full agreement with the accretion rate
predicted by theoretical models of massive star formation. Outflow properties
are tightly correlated with M_{clump},L_{bol} and L_{bol}/M_{clump},and show
the strongest relation with the bolometric clump luminosity. This suggests that
outflows might be driven by the most massive and luminous source within the
clump. The correlations are similar for both low-mass and high-mass outflows
over 7 orders of magnitude, indicating that they may share a similar outflow
mechanism. Outflow energy is comparable to the turbulent energy within the
clump, however, we find no evidence that outflows increase the level of clump
turbulence as the clumps evolve. This implies that the origin of turbulence
within clumps is fixed before the onset of star formation.

less experience samples. Additionally, the model shows higher performance

little quantitative discussion on outflow launching mechanisms have been

present a clear signature of rotation in the bipolar outflow driven by Orion
Source I, a high-mass YSO candidate, using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). A rotational transition of silicon
monoxide (Si18O) reveals a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis
which is consistent with that of the circumstellar disk traced by a
high-excitation water (H2O) line. The launching radii and outward velocity of
the outflow are estimated to be >10 au and 10 km s-1, respectively. These
parameters rule out a possibility that the observed outflow is produced by
entrainment of a high-velocity jet, and that contribution from stellar-wind or
X-wind which have smaller launching radii are significant in the case of Source

the option price is an optimal Q-function, while the optimal hedge is a second
argument of this optimal Q-function, so that both the price and hedge are parts
of the same formula. Pricing is done by learning to dynamically optimize
risk-adjusted returns for an option replicating portfolio, as in the Markowitz
portfolio theory. Using Q-Learning and related methods, once created in a
parametric setting, the model is able to go model-free and learn to price and
hedge an option directly from data, and without an explicit model of the world.
This suggests that RL may provide efficient data-driven and model-free methods
for optimal pricing and hedging of options, once we depart from the academic
continuous-time limit, and vice versa, option pricing methods developed in
Mathematical Finance may be viewed as special cases of model-based
Reinforcement Learning. Further, due to simplicity and tractability of our

shows a luminosity effect in evolved A through G stars. However, its general
behavior across the HR diagram is not yet well understood, since the
applicability limit of the relations proposed by various previous work (tending
to be biased toward supergiants) still remains unclear. Besides, our
understanding on the nature of atmospheric micro-scale turbulence, which is
considered to play a significant role (along with the non-LTE line
intensification) for the cause of this effect, is still insufficient. Towards
clarifying these problems, we carried out an extensive non-LTE spectrum-fitting
analysis of O I 7771--5 lines for unbiased sample of 75 evolved A-, F,- and
G-type stars over wide luminosity classes (from subgiants through supergiants)
including rapid rotators, from which the total equivalent width (W_77) was
derived and the microturbulence (xi) was determined by two different (profile-
and abundance-based) methods for each star. While we confirmed that W_77 tends
to increase in the global sense as a star's absolute magnitude (M_V) becomes
more luminous, distinctly different trends were found between lower-gravity
(log g <~ 2.5) and higher-gravity (log g >~ 2.5) stars, in the sense that the
M_V vs. W_77 formulas proposed by past studies are applicable only to the
former supergiant group. In case of using W_77 for empirical M_V evaluation by
such simple formulas, it is recommended to confine only to supergiants of -5 >
M_V > -10. Regarding the microturbulence significantly controlling W_77, it
roughly shows an increasing tendency with a decrease in surface gravity.
However, the trend is not monotonic but rather intricate (e.g., hump,
stagnation, or discontinuously large increase) depending on the stellar type
and evolutionary stage.

(ROAST) for the discrete vector that one obtains when collecting a finite set
of uniform samples from a baseband analog signal. The ROAST offers an
orthogonal projection which is an approximation to the orthogonal projection
onto the leading discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS) vectors (also
known as Slepian basis vectors). As such, the ROAST is guaranteed to accurately
and compactly represent not only oversampled bandlimited signals but also the
leading DPSS vectors themselves. Moreover, the subspace angle between the ROAST
subspace and the corresponding DPSS subspace can be made arbitrarily small. The
complexity of computing the representation of a signal using the ROAST is
comparable to the FFT, which is much less than the complexity of using the DPSS
basis vectors. We also give non-asymptotic results to guarantee that the
proposed basis not only provides a very high degree of approximation accuracy
in a mean squared error sense for bandlimited sample vectors, but also that it
can provide high-quality approximations of all sampled sinusoids within the
band of interest.

retrieval setting, which allows the database and the training set to come from
different but relevant domains. However, the transfer retrieval setting will
introduce two technical difficulties: first, the hash model trained on the

database points to be within a small Hamming ball. As a consequence, transfer
retrieval performance within Hamming Radius 2 degrades significantly in

This finite set of receptors must inevitably be cross-reactive to multiple

study, we computationally examined the cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors and
peptides derived from infectious diseases based on the pairwise binding energy
of their amino acid sequences. We found that T-cell receptors have diverse
amino acid compositions, leading to a broad spectrum of cross-reactivity in
peptide binding. High/low cross-reactive T-cell receptors have more/less
strongly interacting amino acids. Then, we investigated the target searching
time of the natural T-cell repertoire and compared the target searching time
between the high and low cross-reactive T-cell repertoires. According to our
computational results, the natural T-cell repertoire is specific and
sufficiently rapid in searching for certain targets. High cross-reactive and
non-specific T cells require more time to unbind from incorrect targets, while
low cross-reactive T cell receptors require more time to search for the correct
targets. Our computational platform, which is based on molecular sequences and
their pairwise binding energy, could be useful in further explorations of
immunological recognition.

binaries, and study the stochastic GW backgrounds (SGWBs) or the co-detection
rates of GWs associate with SGRBs (GW-SGRBs). But before that, the most
important thing is to derive the GW spectrum from a single GW source. Usually,
GW spectrum from a circular orbit binary is assumed. However, observations of
the large spatial offsets of SGRBs from their host galaxies imply that SGRB
progenitors may be formed by the dynamical processes, and will merge with
residual eccentricities. The orbital eccentricity has important effect on GW
spectra, and therefore on the SGWB and GW-SGRB co-detection rate. Our results
show that the power spectra of the SGWBs from eccentric compact binaries are
greatly suppressed at low frequencies. Especially, SGWBs from binaries with
high residual eccentricities will hard to be detected (above the detection
frequency of $\sim100~\rm Hz$). For the co-detection rates of GW-SGRB events,
they could be $\sim1.4$ times higher than the circular case within some
particular ranges of $e_{\rm r}$ , but greatly reduced for high residual
eccentricities (e.g., $e_{\rm r}>0.1$ for BNSs). In general, the BBH
progenitors produce 200 and 10 times higher GW-SGRB events than the BNS and

(complex tori). In the first section we give a short introduction to the theory
of elliptic functions.
  Section 2 is devoted to one-parametric families of holomorphic and
meromorphic functions. We recall the role of such families on Loewner's
equation in solving some problems of the theory of univalent functions. Further
we deduce a system of ODEs expressing dependence of critical points of a family
of rational functions from their critical values. This gives an approximate
method to find a conformal mapping of the Riemann sphere onto a given
simply-connected compact Riemann surface over the sphere. Thereafter a similar
problem is solved for elliptic functions uniformizing complex tori over the
Riemann sphere. The corresponding system of ODEs also contains a differential
equation for the modules of complex tori.
  In Section 3 we apply complex tori in some problems connected to Pade-Hermit
approximations. We study the partition of a 3-sheeted Riemann surface into
sheets induced by some abelian integrals (so-called Nattall's partition). In
the symmetric case we describe the structure of trajectories of quadratic
differentials connected with the abelian integrals.

enabling explicit detection of the [S III] 6312 and 9069,9531 lines and thus
determination of the [S III] temperature. Abundance ratios are derived and
generally consistent with AGB model predictions. Our PNe probably all evolved
from low-mass (<2 M_sun) stars, as analyzed with the most up-to-date post-AGB
evolutionary models, and their main-sequence ages are mostly ~2-5 Gyr. Compared
to the underlying, smooth, metal-poor halo of M31, our targets are uniformly
metal-rich ([O/H]> -0.4), and seem to resemble the younger population in the
stream. We thus speculate that our halo PNe formed in the Giant Stream's
progenitor through extended star formation. Alternatively, they might have
formed from the same metal-rich gas as did the outer-disk PNe, but was
displaced into their present locations as a result of galactic interactions.
These interpretations are, although speculative, qualitatively in line with the
current picture, as inferred from previous wide-field photometric surveys, that
M31's halo is the result of complex interactions and merger processes. The
behavior of N/O of the combined sample of the outer-disk and our
halo/substructure PNe signifies that hot bottom burning might actually occur at
<3 M_sun, but careful assessment is needed.

disentangling and fusing Generative Adversarial Network (DF-GAN). First, three
domains are constructed, corresponding to the distributions of occluded faces,
clean faces and structured occlusions. The disentangling and fusing processes
are formulated as the transformations between the three domains. Then the
disentangling and fusing networks are built to learn the transformations from
unpaired data, where the encoder-decoder structure is adopted and allows DF-GAN
to simulate structure occlusions by modifying the latent representations.
Finally, the disentangling and fusing processes are unified into a dual
learning framework along with an adversarial strategy. The proposed method is
evaluated on Meshface verification problem. Experimental results on four
Meshface databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for the

brachistochrone problem. The classical brachistochrone for a non-dissipative
particle is governed by maximization of the particle's kinetic energy resulting
in a cycloid. We consider a variant where the particle is replaced by a bottle
filled with a viscous fluid and attempt to identify the shape of a curve
connecting two points along which the bottle would move in the shortest time.
We derive the system of integro-differential equations governing system
dynamics for a given shape of the curve. Using these equations, we pose the
brachistochrone problem invoking optimal control formalism and show that (in
general) the curve deviates from a cycloid. This is due to the fact that
increasing the rate of change of bottle kinetic energy is accompanied by
increased viscous dissipation. We show that the bottle motion is governed by a
balance between the desire to minimize travel time and the need to reach the
end point in the face of increased dissipation. The trade-off between these two
physical forces plays a vital role in determining the brachistochrone of a
fluid-filled cylinder. We show that in the two limits of either vanishing or
high viscosity, the brachistochrone for this problem reduces to a cycloid. An
intermediate viscosity range is identified where the fluid brachistochrone is
non-cycloidal. Finally, we show relevance of these results to the dynamics of a
rolling liquid marble.

Synchrotron emission is the signature of non-thermal emitting particles,
typical of many high-energy astrophysical sources, both Galactic and
extra-galactic ones. Its spectral and polarization properties allow us to infer
key informations on the particles distribution function and magnetic field
geometry. In recent years our understanding of pulsar wind nebulae has improved
substantially thanks to a combination of observations and numerical models. A
robust detection or non-detection of circular polarization will enable us to
discriminate between an electron-proton plasma and a pair plasma, clarifying
once for all the origin of the radio emitting particles, setting strong
constraints on the pair production in pulsar magnetosphere, and the role of
turbulence in the nebula. Previous attempts at measuring the circular
polarization have only provided upper limits, but the lack of accurate
estimates, based on reliable models, makes their interpretation ambiguous. We
show here that those results are above the expected values, and that current
polarimetric tecniques are not robust enough for conclusive result, suggesting
that improvements in construction and calibration of next generation radio

phonon confined in one layer of the material. Our theoretical approach is based
on expressing the crucial matter excitations (intersubband electrons and
phonons) in terms of polarisation densities in second quantisation, and
treating all non-resonant polarisations with an effective dielectric function.
The interaction between the electronic and phononic polarizations is treated
perturbatively, and gives rise to stimulated emission of polartions in the case
of inverted subbands. Our model provides a complete physical insight of the
system and allows to determine the phonon and photon fraction of the laser
gain. Moreover, it can be applied and extended to any type of designs and
material systems, offering a wide set of possibilities for the optimization of
future phonon-polariton lasers.

chemical stability against oxidation, superior to MoS2. However, the presence
of intrinsic Se vacancy (VSe) and light illumination can markedly affect the
surface activity. In particular, the excess electrons associated with the
exposed In atoms at the VSe site under illumination are able to remarkably
reduce the dissociation barrier of O2 to ~0.2 eV. Moreover, at ambient
conditions, the splitting of O2 enables the formation of substitutional
(apical) oxygen atomic species, which further cause the trapping and subsequent
rapid splitting of H2O molecules and ultimately the formation of hydroxyl
groups. Our findings uncover the causes and underlying mechanisms of InSe
surface degradation via the defect-photo promoted oxidations. Such results will

fact, pseudotensor mesons belong to a so-called heterochiral multiplet, for
which a quadratic mixing term between nonstrange and strange isoscalar members
arises. On the contrary, for so-called homochiral multiplets, such as the
ground-state (axial-)vector and tensor mesons, this mixing is not possible,
hence one can easily understand why the isoscalar members of these multiplets
are almost purely nonstrange and strange, respectively. Moreover, the axial
anomaly can be also coupled to baryons (within the mirror assignment), and thus
it helps to explain the large decay width $ N^{\ast }(1535)\rightarrow N\eta$

superfluid dates back to the work by Gor'kov and Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB), who
addressed it for a weakly-coupled (dilute) superfluid in the BCS

particle-particle (pairing) excitations, which are responsible for
superfluidity to occur below Tc, and particle-hole excitations, which give rise
to screening also in a normal system, get effectively disentangled from each
other in the BCS limit, thus yielding a reduction by a factor 2.2 of the value
of Tc obtained when neglecting screening effects. Subsequent work on this
topic, aimed at extending the original GMB argument away from the BCS limit
with diagrammatic methods, has kept this disentangling between pairing and
screening throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, without realising that the
conditions for it to be valid are soon violated away from the BCS limit. Here,
we reconsider this problem from a more general perspective and argue that
pairing and screening are intrinsically entangled with each other along the
whole BCS-BEC crossover but for the BCS limit considered by GMB. We perform a
detailed numerical calculation of the GMB diagrammatic contribution extended to
the whole BCS-BEC crossover, where the full wave-vector and frequency
dependence occurring in the repeated in-medium two-particle scattering is duly
taken into account. Our numerical calculations are tested against analytic
results available in both the BCS and BEC limits, and the contribution of the
GMB diagrammatic term to the scattering length of composite bosons in the BEC
limit is highlighted. We calculate Tc throughout the BCS-BEC crossover and find
that it agrees quite well with Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and

ray-tracing methods, we exhibit the existence of unstable orbits around
vortices at arbitrary depth. These orbits are the analogue of the light rings
of a black hole. We show that these orbits come in pairs, one co-rotating and
one counter-rotating, at a critical radius that varies with the frequency. We
derived an explicit formula for this radius in the deep water regime. Our
method is validated by comparison with recent experimental data from a wavetank
experiment. We finally argue that these rings will generate a discrete set of
damped resonances that we characterize and that could possibly be observed in
future experiments.

Southern Province, the Superior Province, the Sudbury Structure and the
Grenville Front Tectonic Zone. Nine representative aggregate units of exposed

probed with 109 rock samples supported by compiled geochemical databases. A
detailed study of the lognormal distributions of U and Th abundances and of
their correlation permits a bivariate analysis for a robust treatment of the
uncertainties. A downloadable 3D numerical model of U and Th distribution
defines an average heat production of 1.5$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$$\mu$W/m$^{3}$, and
predicts a contribution of 7.7$^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$TNU (a Terrestrial Neutrino Unit

restrict the SNO+ capability of experimentally discriminating among BSE

production and the geoneutrino signal at SNO+ will be inefficient without more

spin-3 gravity is thought to be holographically dual to W$_3$ extended CFT on a

algebra, in the limit of large central charge $c$ a linear finite-dimensional
subalgebra generated by $W_n \, (n=0,\pm1,\pm2)$ and $L_n (n= 0,\pm1)$ is
singled out. The localized state is constructed in terms of these generators.
To write down an equation of motion for a scalar field which is satisfied by
this localized state it is necessary to introduce new variables for an internal
space $\alpha^{\pm}$, $\beta^{\pm}$, $\gamma$, in addition to ordinary
coordinates $x^{\pm}$ and $y$. The higher-dimensional space, which combines the
bulk spacetime with the `internal space', which is an analog of superspace in
supersymmetric theory, is introduced. The `physical bulk spacetime' is a 3D
hypersurface with constant $\alpha^{\pm}$, $\beta^{\pm}$ and $\gamma$ embedded
in this space. We will work in Poincar\'e coordinates of AdS space and consider
W-quasi-primary operators $\Phi_{h}(x^+)$ with a conformal weight $h$ in the
boundary and study two and three point functions of W-quasi-primary operators
transformed as $e^{ix^+L^h_{-1}} e^{\beta^+W^h_{-1}} \Phi_{h}(0)
e^{-\beta^+W^h_{-1}}e^{-ix^+L^h_{-1}}$. Here $L^h_n$ and $W^h_n$ are sl(3,R)
generators in the hyperbolic basis for Poincar\'e coordinates. It is shown that
in the $\beta^+ \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the conformal weight changes to a
new value $h'=h/2$. This may be regarded as a Renormalization Group (RG) flow.
It is argued that this RG flow will be triggered by terms $\Delta S \propto
\beta^+ W^h_{-1}+\beta^- \overline{W}^h_{-1}$ added to the action.

materials. Most recently, in the context of unconventional superconductors like
the iron-based superconductors, they have excited considerable interest. We
analyze the fluctuation corrections to the equation of state of the
density-wave order parameter for commensurate charge-density waves and
spin-density waves due to perfect nesting. For XY magnets, we find that
contributions due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations cancel each
other, making the mean-field analysis of the problem controlled. This is
consistent with the analysis of fluctuation corrections to the BCS theory of
superconductivity [S. Kos, A. J. Millis, and A. I. Larkin, Phys. Rev. B 70,
214531 (2004)]. However, this cancellation does not occur in density-wave
systems when the order parameter is a real $N$-component object with $N\neq2$.
Then, the number of transverse fluctuating modes differs from the number of
longitudinal fluctuating modes. Indeed, in the case of charge-density waves as
well as spin-density waves with Heisenberg symmetry, we find that fluctuation
corrections are not negligible, and hence mean-field theories are not
justified. These singular fluctuations originate from the intermediate
length-scale regime, with wavelengths between the lattice constant and the
$T=0$ correlation length. The resulting logarithmic fluctuation contributions
to the gap equation originate from the derivative of the anomalous polarization
function, and the crucial process is an interaction of quasiparticles through
the exchange of fluctuations.

disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance, but the involved mechanisms are
still elusive. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from
obese individuals, we found that both hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA
(encoding platelet derived growth factor alpha) and PDGFA overexpression are
associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin
resistance and increased steatohepatitis risk. Both genetic risk score studies
and human cell modeling pointed to a causative impact of high insulin levels on
PDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA
secretion from liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its
own expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin
resistance through decreased expression of both insulin receptor substrate 1
and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be
restored by PDGF-AA blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor inhibitors and by
metformin opening therapeutic avenues. Conclusion: Therefore, in the liver of
obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin
resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and NAFLD.

structure of the underlying string model, we highlight the role of the master
symmetry which can be employed to construct all symmetries of the model. The
algebra of these symmetries is worked out. For the concrete case of minimal
surfaces in $AdS_5$, we discuss the deformation of the four-cusp solution,
which provides the dual description of the four-gluon scattering amplitude.
This marks the first step toward transferring the master symmetry to scattering
amplitudes. Moreover, we compute the master and Yangian symmetry variations of
generic, smooth boundary curves. The discussion clarifies why previous attempts
to transfer the deformations of minimal surfaces in $AdS_3$ to weak coupling
were unsuccessful. We discuss several attempts to transfer the Yangian symmetry
to weak or arbitrary coupling, but ultimately conclude that a Yangian symmetry
of the Maldacena-Wilson loop seems not to be present. This is different for the
natural supersymmetric generalizations of the Maldacena--Wilson loop, Wilson
loops in superspace. Their one-loop expectation value is known to be Yangian
invariant. We discuss the strong-coupling counterpart of this finding by
considering minimal surfaces in the superspace of type IIB superstring theory
in $AdS_5 \times S^5$. The comparison of the strong-coupling invariance derived
here with the weak-coupling generators shows that the local term must depend on
the coupling in a non-trivial way. Additionally, we show that the higher-level
recurrences of the hypercharge generator, the so-called bonus symmetries, are
present in all higher levels of the Yangian.

response to plasma flows tangential to the photosphere and magnetic flux
emergence through it. Analyzing this transfer of magnetic helicity is key for
identifying its role in the dynamics of active regions (ARs). The
connectivity-based helicity flux density method was recently developed for
studying the 2D and 3D transfer of magnetic helicity in ARs. The method takes
into account the 3D nature of magnetic helicity by explicitly using knowledge
of the magnetic field connectivity, which allows it to faithfully track the
photospheric flux of magnetic helicity. Because the magnetic field is not
measured in the solar corona, modeled 3D solutions obtained from force-free
magnetic field extrapolations must be used to derive the magnetic connectivity.
Different extrapolation methods can lead to markedly different 3D magnetic
field connectivities, thus questioning the reliability of the
connectivity-based approach in observational applications. We address these
concerns by applying this method to the isolated and internally complex AR
11158 with different magnetic field extrapolation models. We show that the
connectivity-based calculations are robust to different extrapolation methods,
in particular with regards to identifying regions of opposite magnetic helicity
flux. We conclude that the connectivity-based approach can be reliably used in
observational analyses and is a promising tool for studying the transfer of
magnetic helicity in ARs and relate it to their flaring activity.

FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable medium. We find that threading vortex rings with a
vortex string results in significant qualitative differences in their evolution
and interaction. In particular, threading prevents the annihilation of rings in
a head-on collision, allows generic ring overtaking, and can even reverse the
direction of motion of a ring. We identify that an important mechanism for
producing this new behaviour is that threaded vortex rings interact indirectly
via induced twisting of the threading vortex string.

light-fidelity (Li-Fi), is one of the key emerging technologies which promises
huge bandwidths and data rates. In Li-Fi, the data is modulated on optical
intensities and transmitted and detected using light-emitting-diodes (LED) and
photodiodes respectively. A network of such LED access points illuminates a
given region in the form of attocells. Akin, to wireless networks, co-channel
interference or simply interference is a major impediment in Li-Fi attocell
networks. Also, when in such networks, the field-of-view (FOV) of a photodiode
is limited, the network interference distribution gets affected significantly.
So, for any given network scenario, interference characterization is critical
for good system design. Currently, there are no good closed-form approximations
to interference in Li-Fi attocell networks, that can be used for the analysis
of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (or coverage), particularly for the
case of limited FOVs. In this paper, using a technique from Fourier analysis,
we provide a very close approximation to interference in one and two dimension
Li-Fi attocell networks for any given finite inter-LED separation. We validate
the interference approximation by providing theoretical error bounds using
asymptotics and by performing numerical simulations. We show that our method of
approximation can be extended to characterize interference in limited FOV
scenarios as well.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently proposed robust 3D face alignment methods establish either dense or
sparse correspondence between a 3D face model and a 2D facial image. The use of
these methods presents new challenges as well as opportunities for facial
texture analysis. In particular, by sampling the image using the fitted model,
a facial UV can be created. Unfortunately, due to self-occlusion, such a UV map
is always incomplete. In this paper, we propose a framework for training Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to complete the facial UV map extracted
from in-the-wild images. To this end, we first gather complete UV maps by
fitting a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to various multiview image and video
datasets, as well as leveraging on a new 3D dataset with over 3,000 identities.
Second, we devise a meticulously designed architecture that combines local and
global adversarial DCNNs to learn an identity-preserving facial UV completion
model. We demonstrate that by attaching the completed UV to the fitted mesh and
generating instances of arbitrary poses, we can increase pose variations for
training deep face recognition/verification models, and minimise pose
discrepancy during testing, which lead to better performance. Experiments on
both controlled and in-the-wild UV datasets prove the effectiveness of our
adversarial UV completion model. We achieve state-of-the-art verification
accuracy, $94.05\%$, under the CFP frontal-profile protocol only by combining
pose augmentation during training and pose discrepancy reduction during
testing. We will release the first in-the-wild UV dataset (we refer as WildUV)
that comprises of complete facial UV maps from 1,892 identities for research
purposes.

  Device Structures",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metal halide perovskites are attracting tremendous interest for a variety of
optoelectronic applications. The ability to tune the perovskite bandgap by
tweaking the chemical compositions opens up new applications as coloured
emitters and as components of tandem photovoltaics. Nevertheless, non-radiative
losses are still limiting performance, with luminescence yields in
state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells still far from 100% under solar
illumination conditions. Furthermore, in mixed halide perovskite systems
designed for continuous bandgap tunability (bandgaps ~1.7-1.9 eV),
photo-induced ion segregation leads to bandgap instabilities. Here, we
substantially mitigate both non-radiative losses and photo-induced ion
migration in perovskite structures by decorating the surfaces and grain
boundaries with passivating potassium-halide interlayers. We demonstrate
external photo-luminescence quantum yields of 66%, translating to internal
yields exceeding 95%. The high luminescence yields are achieved while
maintaining high mobilities over 40 cm2V-1s-1, giving the elusive combination
of both high luminescence and excellent charge transport. We find that the
external luminescence yield when interfaced with electrodes in a solar cell
device stack, a quantity that must be maximized to approach the efficiency
limits, remains as high as 15%, indicating very clean interfaces. We also
demonstrate the inhibition of photo-induced ion migration processes across a
wide range of mixed halide perovskite bandgaps that otherwise show bandgap
instabilities. We validate these results in full operating solar cells,
highlighting the importance of stabilising luminescence in device structures.
Our work represents a critical breakthrough in the construction of tunable
halide perovskite films and interfaces that can approach the efficiency limits
in tandem solar cells and coloured LEDs.

  pages)",,"10.1142/S0218127417300488",,"cond-mat.soft math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses testing of compressed structures, such as shells, that
exhibit catastrophic buckling and notorious imperfection sensitivity. The
central concept is the probing of a loaded structural specimen by a controlled
lateral displacement to gain quantitative insight into its buckling behaviour
and to measure the energy barrier against buckling. This can provide design
information about a structure's stiffness and robustness against buckling in
terms of energy and force landscapes. Developments in this area are relatively
new but have proceeded rapidly with encouraging progress. Recent experimental
tests on uniformly compressed spherical shells, and axially loaded cylinders,
show excellent agreement with theoretical solutions. The probing technique
could be a valuable experimental procedure for testing prototype structures,
but before it can be used a range of potential problems must be examined and
solved. The probing response is highly nonlinear and a variety of complications
can occur. Here, we make a careful assessment of unexpected limit points and
bifurcations, that could accompany probing, causing complications and possibly
even collapse of a test specimen. First, a limit point in the probe
displacement (associated with a cusp instability and fold) can result in
dynamic buckling as probing progresses, as demonstrated in the buckling of a
spherical shell under volume control. Second, various types of bifurcations
which can occur on the probing path which result in the probing response
becoming unstable are also discussed. To overcome these problems, we outline
the extra controls over the entire structure that may be needed to stabilize
the response.

image recognition. However, they require a huge amount of computations and
model parameters, which are not suitable for mobile and embedded devices.
Therefore, MobileNet was proposed, which can reduce the number of parameters
and computational cost dramatically. The main idea of MobileNet is to use a
depthwise separable convolution. Two hyper-parameters, a width multiplier and a
resolution multiplier are used to the trade-off between the accuracy and the
latency. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to improve the MobileNet.
Instead of using the resolution multiplier, we use a depth multiplier and
combine with either Fractional Max Pooling or the max pooling. Experimental
results on CIFAR database show that the proposed architecture can reduce the
amount of computational cost and increase the accuracy simultaneously.

eruptive) ranging from GOES class B3 to X17. We use H$\alpha$ filtergrams from
Kanzelh\""ohe Observatory together with SDO HMI and SOHO MDI magnetograms to
derive magnetic reconnection fluxes and rates. The flare reconnection flux is
strongly correlated with the peak of the GOES 1-8 \AA\ soft X-ray flux (c=0.92,
in log-log space), both for confined and eruptive flares. Confined flares of a
certain GOES class exhibit smaller ribbon areas but larger magnetic flux
densities in the flare ribbons (by a factor of 2). In the largest events, up to
$\approx$50\%\ of the magnetic flux of the active region (AR) causing the flare
is involved in the flare magnetic reconnection. These findings allow us to
extrapolate toward the largest solar flares possible. A complex solar AR
hosting a magnetic flux of $2\cdot 10^{23}\, \mathrm{Mx}$, which is in line
with the largest AR fluxes directly measured, is capable of producing an X80
flare, which corresponds to a bolometric energy of about $7 \cdot 10^{32}$
ergs. Using a magnetic flux estimate of $6\cdot 10^{23}\, \mathrm{Mx}$ for the
largest solar AR observed, we find that flares of GOES class $\approx$X500
could be produced ($E_{\rm bol} \approx 3 \cdot 10^{33}$ ergs). These estimates
suggest that the present day's Sun is capable of producing flares and related
space weather events that may be more than an order of magnitude stronger than
have been observed to date.

contact angle hysteresis using liquid bridges under cyclic compression and
stretching between two identical plates. Under various loading rates, contact
angle hysteresis for three different liquids was measured by examination of
advancing and receding angles in liquid bridges, and the capillary forces were
recorded. It is found that, for a given liquid, the hysteretic phenomenon of
the contact angle is more pronounced at higher loading rates. By unifying the
behaviour of the three liquids, power-law correlations were proposed to
describe the relationship between the dynamic contact angle and the capillary
number for advancing and receding cases. It is found that the exponents of
obtained power-law correlations differ from those derived through earlier
methods (e.g., capillary rise), due to the different kinematics of the
triple-line. The various hysteretic loops of capillary force in liquid bridges
under varied cyclic loading rates were also observed, which can be captured
quantitatively by the prediction of our developed model incorporating the
dynamic contact angle hysteresis. These results illustrate the importance of
varying triple-line geometries during dynamic wetting and dewetting processes,
and warrant an improved modelling approach for higher level phenomena involving
these processes, e.g., multiphase flow in porous media and liquid transfer
between surfaces with moving contact lines.

The previously proposed interpolation method is generalized for calculation of

lattice as a representative example. Using molecular dynamics simulations, it
is found that the snub square lattice is being broken under heating, generating
high density quasicrystalline phase with 12-fold symmetry. Simple theoretical
model is proposed to explain the physical mechanism governing this phenomenon:
With density growth (from square to hexagonal phases), the concentrations of
different local configurations randomly realized through plane tilling are
being changed that minimizes the energy of the system. The calculated phase
diagram in the intermediate region of densities justifies the existence of HD12
phase and demonstrates a cascade of the first-order transitions ""square -- HD12

better understand the physical mechanisms responsive for formation of

The role of outflows in AGN feedback processes can be better understood by
placing observational constraints on wind locations and kinetic energies. We
utilize broad absorption line (BAL) variability to investigate the properties
of a sample of 71 BAL quasars with P$\thinspace$V broad absorption. The
presence of P$\thinspace$V BALs indicates that other BALs like C$\thinspace$IV
are saturated, such that variability in those lines favours clouds crossing the
line of sight. We use these constraints with measurements of BAL variability to
estimate outflow locations and energetics. Our data set consists of
multiple-epoch spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and MDM Observatory.
We detect significant (4$\sigma$) BAL variations from 10 quasars in our sample
over rest frame time-scales between < 0.2-3.8 yr. Our derived distances for the
10 variable outflows are nominally < 1-10 pc from the SMBH using the
transverse-motion scenario, and < 100-1000 pc from the central source using
ionization-change considerations. These distances, in combination with the
estimated high outflow column densities (i.e. $N_{\textrm{H}}$ > 10$^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$), yield outflow kinetic luminosities between ~ 0.001-1 times the
bolometric luminosity of the quasar, indicating that many absorber energies

Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) physics, and to show how the usual phenomenology
arises from it. This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to
the underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the
Higgs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the
BEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by
carefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase
diagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of
gauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbation
theory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible to
rederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows why
the description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,
gauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but
also of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful. These are
unavoidable consequences of the field theory underlying the standard model,
from which the usual picture emerges. The validity of this emergence can only
be tested non-perturbatively. Such tests, in particular using lattice gauge
theory, will be reviewed as well. They fully confirm the underlying mechanisms.
It will be seen that the structure of the standard model is very special, and
qualitative changes occur beyond it. The extension beyond the standard model
will therefore also be reviewed. Particular attention will be given to
structural differences arising for phenomenology. Again, non-perturbative tests
of these results will be reviewed. Finally, to make this review self-contained
a brief discussion of issues like the triviality and hierarchy problem, and how
they fit into a fundamental field-theoretical formulation, is included.

  Architectures",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an
academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as
evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide
access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct
quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit
quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions
of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5,
respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the
desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has
to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied
- a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently
conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which
addresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a
realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at
the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum
gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured
for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK.
Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms
IBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed
approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while
IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in
several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped
circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required). All
implementations of the proposed methodology is publicly available at
http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping.

characterization to differences in the microbiome composition across groups of
samples. Important challenges of this problem include the large within-group
heterogeneities among samples and the existence of potential confounding
variables that, when ignored, increase the chance of false discoveries and
reduce the power for identifying true differences. We propose a probabilistic
framework to overcome these issues by combining three ideas: (i) a phylogenetic
tree-based decomposition of the cross-group comparison problem into a series of
local tests, (ii) a graphical model that links the local tests to allow
information sharing across taxa, and (iii) a Bayesian testing strategy that
incorporates covariates and integrates out the within-group variation, avoiding
potentially unstable point estimates. We derive an efficient inference
algorithm based on numerical integration and junction-tree message passing,
conduct extensive simulation studies to investigate the performance of our
approach, and compare it to state-of-the-art methods in a number of
representative settings. We then apply our method to the American Gut data to
analyze the association of dietary habits and human's gut microbiome
composition in the presence of covariates, and illustrate the importance of
incorporating covariates in microbiome cross-group comparison.

we extend the timing based localization approximation to incorporate
consistency of observed signals with two gravitational wave polarizations, and
an astrophysically motivated distribution of sources. Both of these provide
significant improvements to source localization, allowing many sources to be
restricted to a single sky region, with an area 40% smaller than predicted by
timing information alone. Furthermore, we show that the vast majority of
sources will be reconstructed to be circularly polarized or, equivalently,
indistinguishable from face-on.

ultrashortperiod contact binaries (USPCBs). Theoretical models were fitted to
the light-curves by means of the Wilson-Devinney code. The solutions suggest
that the three targets have evolved to a contact phase. The photometric results
are as follows: a) 1SWASP J030749.87-365201.7, q=0.439\pm0.003, f=0.0\pm3.6%;
b) 1SWASP J213252.93-441822.6, q=0.560\pm0.003, f=14.2\pm1.9%; c) 1SWASP
J200059.78+054408.9, q=0.436\pm0.008, f=58.4\pm1.8%. The light curves show
O'Connell effects, which can be modeled by assumed cool spots. The cool spots
models are strongly supported by the night-to-night variations in the I-band
light curves of 1SWASP J030749.87-365201.7. For a comparative study, we
collected the whole set of 28 well-studied USPCBs with P < 0.24 day. Thus, we
found that most of them (17 of 28) are in shallow contact (i.e. fill-out
factors f<20%). Only 4 USPCBs have deep fill-out factors (i.e. f>50%).
Generally, contact binaries with deep fill-out factors are going to merge, but
it is believed that USPCBs have just evolved to a contact phase. Hence, the
deep USPCB 1SWASP J200059.78+054408.9 seems to be a contradiction, making it
very interesting. Particularly, 1SWASP J030749.87-365201.7 is a zero contact
binary within thermal equilibrium, implying that it should be a turn-off sample
as predicted by the thermal relaxation oscillation (TRO) theory.

develop an effective approach to parameterize cosmological perturbations beyond

effective Lagrangian contains six independent terms, one of which starts at
cubic order in perturbations. We compute the two gravitational potentials
around a spherical body. Outside and near the body, screening reproduces
standard gravity, with a modified gravitational coupling. Inside the body, the
two potentials are different and depend on the density profile, signalling the
breaking of the Vainshtein screening. We provide the most general expressions

findings to show that the combination of the GW170817 event, the Hulse-Taylor
pulsar and stellar structure physics, constrain the parameters of these general

electrostatic potentials subject to periodic boundary conditions in any or none
of the three spatial dimensions is presented. Ewald decomposition is used to
split the problem into a real-space and a Fourier-space part, and the FFT-based
Spectral Ewald (SE) method is used to accelerate the computation of the latter.
A key component in the unified treatment is an FFT-based solution technique for
the free-space Poisson problem in three, two or one dimensions, depending on
the number of non-periodic directions. The computational cost is furthermore
reduced by employing an adaptive FFT for the doubly and singly periodic cases,
allowing for different local upsampling factors. The SE method will always be
most efficient for the triply periodic case as the cost of computing FFTs will
then be the smallest, whereas the computational cost of the rest of the
algorithm is essentially independent of periodicity. We show that the cost of
removing periodic boundary conditions from one or two directions out of three
will only moderately increase the total runtime. Our comparisons also show that
the computational cost of the SE method in the free-space case is around four
times that of the triply periodic case.
  The Gaussian window function previously used in the SE method, is here
compared to a piecewise polynomial approximation of the Kaiser-Bessel window
function. With a carefully tuned shape parameter that is selected based on an
error estimate for this new window function, runtimes for the SE method can be
further reduced. Furthermore, we consider different methods for computing the
force, and compare the runtime of the SE method with that of the Fast Multipole
Method.

$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ is one of the prime candidates for a

Despite intensive investigations of the material's low-temperature properties,
several important questions remain to be answered. Particularly puzzling are
the 6\,K anomaly and the enigmatic effects observed in magnetic fields. Here we
report on low-temperature measurements of lattice effects which were shown to
be particularly strongly pronounced in this material (R. S. Manna \emph{et
al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{104}, 016403 (2010)). A special focus of our
study lies on sample-to-sample variations of these effects and their
implications on the interpretation of experimental data. By investigating
overall nine single crystals from two different batches, we can state that
there are considerable differences in the size of the second-order phase
transition anomaly around 6\,K, varying within a factor of 3. In addition, we
find field-induced anomalies giving rise to pronounced features in the sample
length for two out of these nine crystals for temperatures $T <$ 9 K. We
tentatively assign the latter effects to $B$-induced magnetic clusters
suspected to nucleate around crystal imperfections. These $B$-induced effects
are absent for the crystals where the 6\,K anomaly is most strongly pronounced.
The large lattice effects observed at 6\,K are consistent with proposed pairing
instabilities of fermionic excitations breaking the lattice symmetry. The
strong sample-to-sample variation in the size of the phase transition anomaly
suggests that the conversion of the fermions to bosons at the instability is
only partial and to some extent influenced by not yet identified
sample-specific parameters.

formation of high-mass stars (M $>8$ M$_\odot$), and present an excellent
opportunity to study the final stages of accretion, which could include
accretion through the HII region itself. This study of the dynamics of the gas

quantify the relationship between the HII regions and their immediate

the radio recombination line H29$\alpha$, some complementary molecules, and the

detections, two appear to have cometary morphologies with velocity gradients
across them, and two appear more spherical with velocity gradients suggestive
of infalling ionised gas. The remaining two were either observed at low

At the large values of the interlayer hopping amplitude, a large number of DOS

Therefore, evolutionary dynamics almost always yields the same value for

with the dimensionality of the feature data. In hyperspectral remote sensing,
feature data can potentially become very high dimensional. However, the amount

hyperspectral remote sensing is how to perform multi-class classification using
only relatively few training data points.
  In this work, we address this issue by enriching the feature matrix with
synthetically generated sample points. This synthetic data is sampled from a
GMM fitted to each class of the limited training data. Although, the true
distribution of features may not be perfectly modeled by the fitted GMM, we
demonstrate that a moderate augmentation by these synthetic samples can
effectively replace a part of the missing training samples. We show the
efficacy of the proposed approach on two hyperspectral datasets. The median
gain in classification performance is $5\%$. It is also encouraging that this
performance gain is remarkably stable for large variations in the number of
added samples, which makes it much easier to apply this method to real-world
applications.

could behave much like the baryonic sector, cooling and fragmenting down to
stellar-mass or smaller scales. Past studies have shown that cosmic microwave
background and large-scale structure constraints rule out $\gtrsim 5\%$ of the
dark matter to behave in this manner. However, we show that, even with percent
level mass fractions, a dark atomic sector could affect some extragalactic and
galactic observables. We track the cooling and merger history of an atomic dark
component for much of the interesting parameter space. Unlike the baryons,
where stellar feedback (driven by nuclear physics) delays the formation and
growth of galaxies, cooling dark atomic gas typically results in disks forming
earlier, leaving more time for their destruction via mergers. Rather than disks
in Milky Way sized halos, we find the end product is typically spheroidal
structures on galactic scales or dark atom fragments distributed on halo
scales. This result contrasts with previous studies, which had assumed that the
dark atoms would result in dark disks. Furthermore the dark atoms condense into
dense clumps, analogous to how the baryons fragment on solar-mass scales. We
estimate the size of these dark clumps, and use these estimates to show that
viable atomic dark matter parameter space is ruled out by stellar microlensing,
by the half-light radii of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, and by Milky Way
mass-to-light inferences.

instructions, were all found to be significant factors in the longitudinal
change of the OHIP-14. Borderline significance was found in terms of dental
anxiety and symptoms. Perceptions, behaviour and attitudes, rather than
socio-demographic characteristics or oral health related knowledge, influence
change in OHRQOL. Trusting that the dentist values the patient as a person and
the importance the patient gives to having good oral health, are not found
significant, yet adhering to dentists advice has a beneficial effect on OHRQOL.

The number of identified complex organic molecules (COMs) in inter-
and circumstellar gas-phase environments is steadily increasing. Recent
laboratory studies show that many such species form on icy dust grains. At
present only smaller molecular species have been directly identified in space
in the solid state. Accurate spectroscopic laboratory data of frozen COMs,
embedded in ice matrices containing ingredients related to their formation
scheme, are still largely lacking.
  Aims. This work provides infrared reference spectra of acetaldehyde
(CH$_3$CHO), ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$)
recorded in a variety of ice environments and for astronomically relevant
temperatures, as needed to guide or interpret astronomical observations,
specifically for upcoming James Webb Space Telescope observations.
  Methods. Fourier transform transmission spectroscopy (500-4000 cm$^{-1}$ /
20-2.5 $\mu$m, 1.0 cm$^{-1}$ resolution) was used to investigate solid
acetaldehyde, ethanol and dimethyl ether, pure or mixed with water, CO,
methanol, or CO:methanol. These species were deposited on a cryogenically
cooled infrared transmissive window at 15~K. A heating ramp was applied, during
which IR spectra were recorded until all ice constituents were thermally
desorbed.
  Results. We present a large number of reference spectra that can be compared
with astronomical data. Accurate band positions and band widths are provided
for the studied ice mixtures and temperatures. Special efforts have been put
into those bands of each molecule that are best suited for identification. For
acetaldehyde the 7.427 and 5.803 $\mu$m bands are recommended, for ethanol the
11.36 and 7.240 $\mu$m bands are good candidates, and for dimethyl ether bands
at 9.141 and 8.011 $\mu$m can be used. All spectra are publicly available in

best linear predictors of the effects using machine learning proxies, average
effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least

effects are proxied (but not necessarily consistently estimated) by predictive
and causal machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into
estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in
conjunction with penalized methods, neural networks, random forests, boosted
trees, and ensemble methods, both predictive and causal. Estimation and
inference are based on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve
validity. We use quantile aggregation of the results across many potential
splits, in particular taking medians of p-values and medians and other
quantiles of confidence intervals. We show that quantile aggregation lowers
estimation risks over a single split procedure, and establish its principal
inferential properties. Finally, our analysis reveals ways to build provably
better machine learning proxies through causal learning: we can use the
objective functions that we develop to construct the best linear predictors of
the effects, to obtain better machine learning proxies in the initial step. We
illustrate the use of both inferential tools and causal learners with a

radio pulsars, sources of FRBs are magnetized neutron stars. Appearance of
strong electric field in a magnetosphere of a neutron star is associated with
close passage of a dense body near hot neutron star. For the repeating source
FRB 121102, which has been observed in four series of bursts, the period of
orbiting of the body is about 200 days. Thermal radiation from the surface of
the star (temperature is of the order of $ 10^8 \, K $) causes evaporation and
ionization of the matter of the dense body. Ionized gas (plasma) flows around
the magnetosphere of the neutron star with the velocity $ u \simeq 10^7 \, cm /
s $, and creates electric potential $ \psi_0 \simeq 10^{11} \, V $ in the polar
region of the magnetosphere. Electrons from the plasma flow are accelerated
toward the star, and gain Lorentz factor of $ \simeq 10 ^ 5 $. Thermal photons
moving toward precipitating electrons are scattered by them, and produce gamma
photons with energies of $ \simeq 10^5 \, m_e c^2 $. These gamma quanta produce
electron-positron pairs in collisions with thermal photons. The multiplicity,
the number of born pairs per one primary electron, is about $ 10^5 $. The
electron-positron plasma, produced in the polar region of magnetosphere,
accumulates in a narrow layer at a bottom of a potential well formed on one
side by a blocking potential $ \psi_0 $, and on the other side by pressure of
thermal radiation. The density of electron-positron plasma in the layer
increases with time, and after short time the layer becomes a mirror for
thermal radiation of the star. The thermal radiation in the polar region under
the layer is accumulated during time $ \simeq 500 \, s $, then the plasma layer
is ejected outside. The ejection is observed as burst of radio emission formed
by the flow of relativistic electron-positron plasma.

freezeout-temperature, which apparently fails to reproduce the first-principle
lattice QCD thermodynamics and the measured particle ratios, etc. is discussed.
The present work suggests a novel interpretation for the so-called {\it
""Tsallis-temperature""}. It is proposed that the low Tsallis-temperature is due
to incomplete implementation of Tsallis algebra though exponential and
logarithmic functions to the high-energy particle-production. Substituting
Tsallis algebra into grand-canonical partition-function of the hadron resonance
gas model seems not assuring full incorporation of nonextensivity or
correlations in that model. The statistics describing the phase-space volume,
the number of states and the possible changes in the elementary cells should be
rather modified due to interacting correlated subsystems, of which the
phase-space is consisting. Alternatively, two asymptotic properties, each is
associated with a scaling function, are utilized to classify a generalized
entropy for such a system with large ensemble (produced particles) and strong
correlations. Both scaling exponents define equivalence classes for all
interacting and noninteracting systems and unambiguously characterize any
statistical system in its thermodynamic limit. We conclude that the nature of
lattice QCD simulations is apparently extensive and accordingly the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is fully fulfilled. Furthermore, we found that the

Gauge-singlet condensates are of the multifermion type and, though it cannot be

difficult for crowdworkers (for example, if the data is high-dimensional or
unintuitive, or the labels are continuous).
  In this work, we develop a novel model for crowdsourcing that can complement
standard practices by exploiting people's intuitions about groups and relations
between them. We employ a recent machine learning setting, called Ballpark
Learning, that can estimate individual labels given only coarse, aggregated
signal over groups of data points. To address the important case of continuous
labels, we extend the Ballpark setting (which focused on classification) to
regression problems. We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem
and propose fast, simple methods with an innate robustness to outliers.
  We evaluate our methods on real-world datasets, demonstrating how useful
constraints about groups can be harnessed from a crowd of non-experts. Our
methods can rival supervised models trained on many true labels, and can obtain
considerably better results from the crowd than a standard label-collection
process (for a lower price). By collecting rough guesses on groups of instances
and using machine learning to infer the individual labels, our lightweight
framework is able to address core crowdsourcing challenges and train machine
learning models in a cost-effective way.

the higher dimensions. The overall spatial curvature is proportional to the
particle`s extra dimensional ground state wave function in the higher
dimensional harmonic confining potential well. Minimizing the overlapping
curvature (proportional to the energy) of two particles in proximity to each
other, subject to the constraint that for the two particles to occupy the same
spatial location one of them must be excited into the first excited state of
the harmonic potential well, gives the desired NN potential. Specifying only
the nucleon masses, the resulting potential well and repulsive core reproduces
the radial profile of several published NN central potential models. In
addition, the predicted height of the repulsive core, when used to estimate the
maximum neutron star mass, matches well with the best estimates from
relativistic theory incorporating standard nuclear matter equations of state.
Nucleon spin, Coulomb interactions, and internal nucleon structure are not
considered in the theory as presented in this article.

understanding the complexities of special relativity. In this paper, we focus
upon one such paradox, namely Bell's spaceship paradox, examining the relative
motion of two uniformly accelerating spaceships. We consider the view from
either spaceship, with the exchange of photons between the two. This recovers
the well known result that the leading spaceship loses sight of the trailing
spaceship as it is redshifted and disappears behind what is known as the
`Rindler horizon'. An immediate impact of this is that if either spaceship
tries to measure the separation through `radar ranging', bouncing photons off
one another, they would both eventually fail to receive any of the photon
`pings' that they emit. We find that the view from this trailing spaceship is,
however, starkly different, initially, seeing the leading spaceship with an
increasing blueshift, followed by a decreasing blueshift. We conclude that,
while the leading spaceship loses sight of the trailing spaceship, for the
trailing spaceship the view of the separation between the two spaceships, and
the apparent angular size of the leading spaceship, approach asymptotic values.
Intriguingly, for particular parametrization of the journey of the two
spaceships, these asymptotic values are identical to those properties seen
before the spaceships began accelerating, and the view from the trailing
spaceship becomes identical to when the two spaceships were initially at rest.

individually addressed nanomechanical resonators where the number of
inputs-outputs for the whole array is the same as that of a single resonator.
While all resonators within an array are interconnected via two metal levels,
each resonator is designed with a distinct resonance frequency which becomes
its individual address. In order to perform single-particle Mass Spectrometry,
the resonance frequencies of the two first modes of each NEMS within an array
are monitored simultaneously. Using such an array, mass spectra of metallic
aggregates in the MDa range are acquired with more than one order of magnitude
improvement in analysis time due to the increase in capture cross section
compared to individual resonators. A 20 NEMS array is probed in 150ms with the
same mass limit of detection as a single resonator. Spectra acquired with a
conventional Time- of-Flight (TOF) mass spectrometer in the same system show
excellent agreement. As individual information for each resonator within the
array is retained, the array becomes a particle imager, each resonator acting
as a pixel. With this technique, we demonstrate how Mass Spectrometry Imaging

and inflaton vacuum fluctuations at a temperature of 5x10^17GeV and dense
enough to make reheating unnecessary. The standard calculation that predicts
the Hubble parameter has to be way smaller than the Planck energy is shown to
be fallacious: it applies the conservation of the perturbative curvature R to a
single inflaton fluctuation when it should be applied to the energy density
contrast of an aggregate. The quantum inflaton fluctuations varphi are with
respect to the classical value phi_0 of the inflaton field phi=phi_0+varphi.
Fluctuations varphi that have grown to the size of the horizon, or a pair of
virtual particles that are separated by a distance the length of the horizon,
are forced to become real and take energy from the potential V(phi_0). The
slowing down of inflation is due to the eventual domination of the continuously
being created radiation over the decreasing inflaton potential V(phi_0). It is
not necessary at all for the potential V(phi_0) to go to zero. Since there is
no need for reheating the inflaton field phi does not couple to matter (except
gravitationally). After inflation, the fluctuations varphi quickly cool down
and can be described as dark matter. Now the inverse process begins to occur.
Inflaton fluctuations varphi that exited the horizon during inflation begin
reentering it after inflation's end. Then they are again causally connected and
have a probability of undergoing the inverse of the quantum process they
underwent before and give their energy back to the potential V(phi_0). The
varphi fluctuations are turning into V(phi_0), which acts as dark energy and
accelerates again the expansion of the universe. The disintegration of a
perturbation is a quantum jump of cosmological size.

$\sigma_k$, stemming from the constraint equations of some modified gravity
theory. For which coefficients is a linear combination of $\sigma_k$
$1/p$-concave, with $0 \leq k \leq p$? We establish connections between the
$1/p$-concavity and the real-rootedness of some polynomials built on the
coefficients. We conjecture that if the restriction of the linear combination
to the positive diagonal is a real-rooted polynomial, then the linear
combination is $1/p$-concave. Using the theory of hyperbolic polynomials, we
show that this would be implied by a short algebraic statement: if the
polynomials $P$ and $Q$ of degree $n$ are real-rooted, then $\sum_{k=0}^n
P^{(k)}Q^{(n-k)}$ is real-rooted as well. This is not proven yet. We conjecture
more generally that the global $1/p$-concavity is equivalent to the
$1/p$-concavity on the positive diagonal. We prove all our guessings for $p=2$.
The way is open for further developments.

  dictionary",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral computed tomography (CT) has a great superiority in lesion
detection, tissue characterization and material decomposition. To further
extend its potential clinical applications, in this work, we propose an
improved tensor dictionary learning method for low-dose spectral CT
reconstruction with a constraint of image gradient L0-norm, which is named as
L0TDL. The L0TDL method inherits the advantages of tensor dictionary learning
(TDL) by employing the similarity of spectral CT images. On the other hand, by
introducing the L0-norm constraint in gradient image domain, the proposed
method emphasizes the spatial sparsity to overcome the weakness of TDL on
preserving edge information. The alternative direction minimization method
(ADMM) is employed to solve the proposed method. Both numerical simulations and
real mouse studies are perform to evaluate the proposed method. The results
show that the proposed L0TDL method outperforms other competing methods, such
as total variation (TV) minimization, TV with low rank (TV+LR), and TDL
methods.

employed as elastic wave manipulation devices and cloaks by imposing
pre-deformation. They provide an alternative to microstructured metamaterials
and can be used in a reconfigurable manner. Previous studies indicate that
exact elastodynamic invariance to pre-deformation holds only for neo-Hookean
solids in the antiplane wave scenario and the semi-linear material in the
in-plane compressional/shear wave context. Furthermore, although ground cloaks
have been considered in the acoustic context they have not yet been discussed
for elastodynamics, either by employing microstructured cloaks or hyperelastic
cloaks. This work therefore aims at exploring the possibility of employing a
range of hyperelastic materials for use as antiplane ground cloaks (AGCs). The
use of the popular incompressible Arruda-Boyce and Mooney-Rivlin nonlinear
materials is explored. The scattering problem associated with the AGC is
simulated via finite element analysis where the cloaked region is formed by an
indentation of the surface. Results demonstrate that the neo-Hookean medium can
be used to generate a perfect hyperelastic AGC as should be expected.
Furthermore, although the AGC performance of the Mooney-Rivlin material is not
particularly satisfactory, it is shown that the Arruda-Boyce medium is an
excellent candidate material for this purpose.

arguments indicate that the edge energy can be viewed as both discontinuous and
multi-valued for a subset of orientations that are commensurate with the

tribological systems; considerable work has been published in the past on the

phenomenon observed within the cylinder-piston system of advanced automotive
engines using aluminium cylinders. This paper investigates the condition
leading to cylinder corrugation in the piston/cylinder system. Material
investigations strongly indicate that heat in the contact is playing a major
role. Using basic analytical relationships from contact mechanics, the
condition required for the onset of such thermo-mechanical instabilities are
investigated. Using the concept of a critical velocity it is shown that such
instabilities can occur for a realistic set of parameters. A significant
technical key factor is the friction coefficient.

  Spatially-Developing Coherent Structures",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective of this work is to investigate the challenges encountered in
Scale-Resolving Simulations (SRS's) of turbulent wake flows driven by
spatially-developing coherent structures. SRS's of practical interest are
expressly intended for efficiently computing such flows by resolving only the
most important features of the coherent structures and modelling the remainder
as stochastic field. The success of SRS methods depends upon three important
factors: i) ability to identify key flow mechanisms responsible for the
generation of coherent structures; ii) determine the optimum range of
resolution required to adequately capture key elements of coherent structures;
and iii) ensure that the modelled part is comprised nearly exclusively of
fully-developed stochastic turbulence. This study considers the canonical case
of the flow around a circular cylinder to address these three key issues. It is
first demonstrated using experimental evidence that the vortex-shedding
instability and flow-structure development involves four important stages. A
series of SRS computations of progressively increasing resolution are
performed. An a priori basis for locating the origin of the coherent structures
development is proposed and examined. The criterion is based on the fact that
the coherent structures are generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability.
The most important finding is that the key aspects of coherent structures can
be resolved only if the effective computational Reynolds number exceeds the
critical value of the KH instability in laminar flows. Finally, a quantitative
criterion assessing the nature of the unresolved field based on the strain-rate
ratio of mean and unresolved fields is examined. The two proposed conditions
and underlying rationale offer a quantitative basis for develop ""good practice""
guidelines for SRS of complex turbulent wake flows with coherent structures.
