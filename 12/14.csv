quantum-mechanical wavefunctions with spin. We use the quaternionic spinor
formalism which is in one-to-one correspondence with the usual spinor language.
No unphysical degrees of freedom are admitted, in contrast to the majority of
literature on quaternions. In this paper we first build a Dirac Lagrangian in
the quaternionic form, derive the Dirac equation and take the non-relativistic
limit to find the Schr\""odinger's equation. We show that the quaternionic
formalism is a natural choice to start with, while in the transition to the
non-interacting non-relativistic limit the quaternionic description effectively
reduces to the regular complex wavefunction language. We provide an easy to use
grammar for switching between the ordinary spinor language and the description
in terms of quaternions. As an illustration of the broader range of the
formalism, we also derive the Maxwell's equation from the quaternionic
Lagrangian of Quantum Electrodynamics. In order to derive the equations of
motion, we develop the variational calculus appropriate for this formalism.

binaries (HMXBs) is dominated by the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources
(ULXs) with luminosity >10^40 erg/s. Such rare objects probably also dominated
the production of X-rays in the early Universe. We demonstrate that a ULX with
Lx~10^40-10^41 erg/s (isotropic-equivalent luminosity in the 0.1-10 keV energy
band) shining for ~10^5 years (the expected duration of a supercritically
accreting phase in HMXBs) can significantly ionise the ISM in its host dwarf
galaxy of total mass M~10^7-10^8 Msun and thereby reduce its opacity to soft
X-rays. As a result, the fraction of the soft X-ray (below 1 keV) radiation
from the ULX escaping into the intergalactic medium (IGM) can increase from
~20-50% to ~30-80% over its lifetime. This implies that HMXBs can induce a
stronger heating of the IGM at z>10 compared to estimates neglecting the ULX
feedback on the ISM. However, larger galaxies with M>3 x 10^8 Msun could not be
significantly ionised even by the brightest ULXs in the early Universe. Since
such galaxies probably started to dominate the global star-formation rate at
z<10, the overall escape fraction of soft X-rays from the HMXB population
probably remained low, <30%, at these epochs.

by the individual oscillator amplitude and the coupling strength, we found the
extended area of parameter-space where the identical oscillators demonstrate
quasiperiodicity, which evolves to chaos via the period doubling of either
resonant limit cycles or complex antiphase symmetric limit cycles with five
winding numbers. The symmetric chaos extends over large parameter areas up to
its loss of stability, followed by a system transition to an unexpected mode:
an asymmetric limit cycle with a winding number of 1:2. In turn, after long
evolution across the parameter-space, this cycle demonstrates a period doubling
cascade which restores the symmetry of dynamics by formation of symmetric
chaos, which nevertheless preserves the memory of the asymmetric limit cycles
in the form of stochastic alternating ""polarization"" of the time series. All
stable attractors coexist with some others, forming remarkable and complex
multistability including the coexistence of torus and limit cycles, chaos and
regular attractors, symmetric and asymmetric regimes. We traced the paths and
bifurcations leading to all areas of chaos, and presented a detailed map of all

Particularly in bilayer structures, because of the competition between strong
quantum confinement and intrinsic screening length, electron and hole dopings
exhibit surprisingly different Stark effects: doped electrons actively screen
the external field and result in a nonlinear Stark effect; however, doped holes
do not effectively screen the external field, causing a linear Stark effect
that is the same as that of undoped materials. Our further analysis shows that
this unusual doping effect is not limited within transition metal

by training a deep network, using fully automatic supervision, to predict
relative scene depth from single images. The relative depth training images are
automatically derived from simple videos of cars moving through a scene, using
recent motion segmentation techniques, and no human-provided labels. This proxy
task of predicting relative depth from a single image induces features in the
network that result in large improvements in a set of downstream tasks
including semantic segmentation, joint road segmentation and car detection, and
monocular (absolute) depth estimation, over a network trained from scratch. The
improvement on the semantic segmentation task is greater than those produced by
any other automatically supervised methods. Moreover, for monocular depth
estimation, our unsupervised pre-training method even outperforms supervised
pre-training with ImageNet. In addition, we demonstrate benefits from learning
to predict (unsupervised) relative depth in the specific videos associated with
various downstream tasks. We adapt to the specific scenes in those tasks in an
unsupervised manner to improve performance. In summary, for semantic
segmentation, we present state-of-the-art results among methods that do not use
supervised pre-training, and we even exceed the performance of supervised
ImageNet pre-trained models for monocular depth estimation, achieving results
that are comparable with state-of-the-art methods.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the relative improvement has been less
drastic as that in 2D static image classification. Three main challenges exist
including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information
representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by
Carreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained
on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representation
learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much more
expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed
and accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification system
through systematic exploration of critical network design choices. In
particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutions
by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed
and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of
the network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-level
semantic features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets with
very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective
designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating,
our system results in an effective video classification system that that
produces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks
(Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two action
detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).

Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 with Swift. There is no intrinsic flux-related
spectral change in the the variable components in any band with small apparent
variations due only to contamination by a second constant component, possibly a
(hard) reflection component in the X-rays and the (red) host galaxy in the
UV/optical bands. Relative to the shortest wavelength band, UVW2, the lags of
the other UV and optical bands are mostly in agreement with the predictions of
reprocessing of high energy emission from an accretion disc. The U-band lag is,
however, far larger than expected, almost certainly because of reprocessed
Balmer continuum emission from the more distant broad line region gas. The UVW2
band is well correlated with the X-rays but lags by ~6x more than expected if
the UVW2 results from reprocessing of X-rays on the accretion disc. However, if
the lightcurves are filtered to remove variations on timescales >5d, the lag
approaches the expectation from disc reprocessing. MEMEcho analysis shows that
direct X-rays can be the driver of most of the variations in the UV/optical
bands as long as the response functions for those bands all have long tails (up
to 10d) in addition to a strong peak (from disc reprocessing) at short lag
(<1d). We interpret the tails as due to reprocessing from the surrounding gas.
Comparison of X-ray to UVW2 and UVW2 to V-band lags for 4 AGN, including NGC
4593, shows that all have UVW2 to V-band lags which exceed the expectations
from disc resprocessing by factor < 2. However the X-ray to UVW2 lags are,
mostly, in greater excess from the expectations from disc reprocessing and
differ between AGN. The largest excess is in NGC 4151. Absorption and
scattering may be affecting X-ray to UV lags.

at the low doping density that is most relevant to realistic experiments and

different many-electron interactions: The Coulomb-hole contribution is dominant

statistically indistinguishable from that of the Jovian Trojans but unlike any

Neptunian Trojans are very cold (blackbody temperature $\sim$50 K) and a
thermal process acting to modify the surface colors at Neptune's distance would
also affect the Kuiper belt objects beyond, where the temperatures are nearly
identical. The distinctive color distributions of the Jovian and Neptunian

the lowest energy exciton in these bilayer heterostructures is varied by over
an order of magnitude within a practical external gate field. We also build a
simple model that captures the essential physics behind this tunability and

that in large $N$ CFTs with a large gap to single-trace higher spin operators,
the stress tensor sector is not only universal, but isolated: that is, $\langle
TT{\cal O}\rangle=0$, where ${\cal O}\neq T$ is a single-trace primary. We show
that this follows from a suppression of $\langle TT{\cal O}\rangle$ by powers
of the higher spin gap, $\Delta_{\rm gap}$, dual to the bulk mass scale of
higher spin particles, and explain why $\langle TT{\cal O}\rangle$ is a more
sensitive probe of $\Delta_{\rm gap}$ than $a-c$ in 4d CFTs. This result
implies that, on the level of cubic couplings, the existence of a consistent
truncation to Einstein gravity is a direct consequence of the absence of higher
spins. By proving similar behavior for other couplings $\langle T{\cal
O}_1{\cal O}_2\rangle$ where ${\cal O}_i$ have spin $s_i\leq 2$, we are led to
propose that $1/\Delta_{\rm gap}$ is the CFT ""dual"" of an AdS derivative in a
classical action. These results are derived by imposing unitarity on mixed
systems of spinning four-point functions in the Regge limit. Using the same
method, but without imposing a large gap, we derive new inequalities on these
three-point couplings that are valid in any CFT. These are generalizations of
the Hofman-Maldacena conformal collider bounds. By combining the collider bound
on $TT$ couplings to spin-2 operators with analyticity properties of CFT data,

drastically weakened for surface states close to the K and K' valleys, which is
unambiguously attributed to the spin polarization through the associated

the particular spin pattern in this area is less effective in damping the
electron-phonon matrix elements, and the result is an exceptional strength of

(SWCNTs) is essential for the development of opto-electronic components and

the studies performed so far use infinite SWCNTs. However, the spectra of
finite and infinite systems are different. In this work the optical spectrum of
finite (3,3) and (5,5) SWCNTs is calculated as a function of nanotube length.
For the (3,3) SWCNTs, the calculated absorption spectra for light polarised
both parallel and perpendicularly to the nanotube axis are in good agreement
with experimental results. However, our results indicate that the lowest energy
peak present in the experimental results for light polarised parallel to the
nanotube axis can be attributed to a surface-plasmon resonance that is a
consequence of the finite nature of the SWCNTs and not to the presence of
SWCNTs with other chiralities, as claimed by the previous theoretical works.
The surface-plasmon resonance is also studied using the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
Finally, this work demonstrates that the surface-plasmon resonance in finite
SWCNT can be described using a 1D infinite well.

modeled by a random coefficient, which then accounts for the uncertain

More precisely, we consider a second order elliptic problem where the random

random partial differential equation, we use a pathwise numerical approximation

combine this characterization with a parametric execution time model and
formulate a mathematical optimization problem. That problem seeks to maximize a
common objective function of 'all the hardware and software parameters'. The
solution to this problem, therefore ""solves"" the codesign problem:
simultaneously choosing software-hardware parameters to optimize total

  We validate this approach by proposing architectural variants of the NVIDIA
Maxwell GTX-980 (respectively, Titan X) specifically tuned to a predetermined
workload of four common 2D stencils (Heat, Jacobi, Laplacian, and Gradient) and
two 3D ones (Heat and Laplacian). Our model predicts that performance would
potentially improve by 28% (respectively, 33%) with simple tweaks to the
hardware parameters such as adapting coarse and fine-grained parallelism by
changing the number of streaming multiprocessors and the number of compute
cores each contains. We propose a set of Pareto-optimal design points to
exploit the trade-off between performance and silicon area and show that by
additionally eliminating GPU caches, we can get a further 2-fold improvement.

also burdens the embedded platforms with intensive computation and storage.
Researchers have investigated on reducing DNN model size with negligible
accuracy loss. This work proposes a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based DNN
training and inference model suitable for embedded platforms with reduced
asymptotic complexity of both computation and storage, making our approach
distinguished from existing approaches. We develop the training and inference
algorithms based on FFT as the computing kernel and deploy the FFT-based
inference model on embedded platforms achieving extraordinary processing speed.

many statistical challenges, such as personalized medicine and optimal resource
allocation. In this paper, we develop a general class of two-step algorithms
for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. We
first estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities in order to form an
objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we
optimize this data-adaptive objective function. Our approach has several
advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is
flexible and easy to use: In both steps, we can use any loss-minimization
method, e.g., penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting;
moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross validation. Meanwhile, in
the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a
quasi-oracle property: Even if the pilot estimates for marginal effects and
treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error
bounds as an oracle who has a priori knowledge of these two nuisance
components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized
regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation
setups, and find promising performance relative to existing baselines.

absence of detectable emission from the TDG in $\textit{Spitzer}$ 3.6 $\mu$m

In many cases, including in quantum-dot based architectures, the parameter
space grows substantially with the number of qubits, and may become a limit to
scalability. Fortunately, machine learning techniques for pattern recognition
and image classification using so-called deep neural networks have shown
surprising successes for computer-aided understanding of complex systems. In
this work, we use deep and convolutional neural networks to characterize states
and charge configurations of semiconductor quantum dot arrays when one can only
measure a current-voltage characteristic of transport (here conductance)
through such a device. For simplicity, we model a semiconductor nanowire
connected to leads and capacitively coupled to depletion gates using the
Thomas-Fermi approximation and Coulomb blockade physics. We then generate
labelled training data for the neural networks, and find at least $90\,\%$
accuracy for charge and state identification for single and double dots purely
from the dependence of the nanowire's conductance upon gate voltages. Using
these characterization networks, we can then optimize the parameter space to
achieve a desired configuration of the array, a technique we call
`auto-tuning'. Finally, we show how such techniques can be implemented in an
experimental setting by applying our approach to an experimental data set, and
outline further problems in this domain, from using charge sensing data to
extensions to full one and two-dimensional arrays, that can be tackled with
machine learning.

cosmology-independent tests which a standard Gaussian likelihood fails. We
demonstrate that sound weak lensing analyses are naturally biased low, and this
does not indicate any new physics such as deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.
Mathematically, the biases arise because noisy two-point functions follow
skewed distributions. This form of bias is already known from CMB analyses,
where the low multipoles have asymmetric error bars. Weak lensing is more
strongly affected by this asymmetry as galaxies form a discrete set of shear
tracer particles, in contrast to a smooth shear field. We demonstrate that the
biases can be up to 30 percent of the standard deviation per data point,
dependent on the properties of the weak lensing survey. Our likelihood provides
a versatile framework with which to address this bias in future weak lensing
analyses.

network, where a layer of relay nodes connects a server to a set of end users.
In particular, a new model is investigated where the intermediate relays employ
caches in addition to the end users. First, a new centralized coded caching
scheme is developed that utilizes maximum distance separable (MDS) coding,
jointly optimizes cache placement and delivery phase, and enables decomposing
the combination network into a set virtual multicast sub-networks. It is shown
that if the sum of the memory of an end user and its connected relay nodes is
sufficient to store the database, then the server can disengage in the delivery
phase and all the end users' requests can be satisfied by the caches in the
network. Lower bounds on the normalized delivery load using genie-aided cut-set
arguments are presented along with second hop optimality. Next recognizing the
information security concerns of coded caching, this new model is studied under
three different secrecy settings: 1) secure delivery where we require an
external entity must not gain any information about the database files by
observing the transmitted signals over the network links, 2) secure caching,
where we impose the constraint that end users must not be able to obtain any

optically-selected TDEs: bright ($>$60\% flux increase) and blue transients
residing in the center of red galaxies. Using photometric selection criteria to
down-select from a total of 493 nuclear transients to a sample of 26 sources,
we then use follow-up UV imaging with the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope,
ground-based optical spectroscopy, and light curve fitting to classify them as
14 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), 9 highly variable active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), 2 confirmed TDEs, and 1 potential core-collapse supernova. We find it
possible to filter AGNs by employing a more stringent transient color cut ($g-r
<$ $-$0.2 mag); further, UV imaging is the best discriminator for filtering
SNe, since SNe Ia can appear as blue, optically, as TDEs in their early phases.
However, when UV-optical color is unavailable, higher precision astrometry can
also effectively reduce SNe contamination in the optical. Our most stringent
optical photometric selection criteria yields a 4.5:1 contamination rate,
allowing for a manageable number of TDE candidates for complete spectroscopic
follow-up and real-time classification in the ZTF era. We measure a TDE per
galaxy rate of 1.7$^{+2.9}_{-1.3}$ $\times$10$^{-4}$ gal$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ (90\%
CL in Poisson statistics). This does not account for TDEs outside our selection
criteria, thus may not reflect the total TDE population, which is yet to be

planes of satellites. Their formation has not been explained satisfactorily
yet. It was suggested that the MW and M31 satellites are ancient tidal dwarf
galaxies, which could explain their configuration. This suggestion gained
support by an analytic backward calculation of the relative MW-M31 orbit in the
MOND modified dynamics paradigm by Zhao et al. (2013) implying their close
flyby 7-11 Gyr ago. Here we explore the Local Group history in MOND in more
detail using a simplified first-ever self-consistent simulation. We note the
features induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify their possible
real counterparts. The simulation was set to approximately reproduce the
observed MW and M31 masses, effective radii, separation, relative velocity and
disk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code
Phantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M31
along a tidal tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures
resembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating
planar structure formed around M31 from the transferred material. It had a size
similar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the
simulated MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the
tidal features observed around M31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the
MW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A
cloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the
actual MW satellite system. The encounter did not end by merging in a Hubble
time. The simulation thus demonstrated that MOND can possibly explain many
peculiarities of the Local Group and, moreover, that non-merging galaxy
encounters in MOND can produce tidal features in galaxies.

RB is equivalent to the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. Further, the RB
expansion constitutes an exact solution to a non-interacting field theory, and
has been used as a reasonable ansatz for an interacting one. In this work, we
show how one can go beyond the RB ansatz towards an exact solution of the
interacting operator Klein-Gordon equation, which can be solved iteratively to
ever higher precision. Our Generalized Ruffini-Bonazzola approach takes into
account contributions from nontrivial harmonic dependence of the wavefunction,
using a sum of terms with energy $k\,E_0$, where $k\geq1$ and $E_0$ is the
chemical potential of a single bound axion. The method critically depends on an
expansion in a parameter $\Delta \equiv \sqrt{1 - E_0{}^2/m^2} < 1$, where $m$
is the mass of the boson. In the case of the axion potential, we calculate
corrections which are relevant for axion stars in the transition or dense
branches of solutions. We find with high precision the local minimum of the
mass, $M_{min}\approx 463\,f^2/m$, at $\Delta\approx0.27$, where $f$ is the

transition between an integer quantum Hall state and an insulator. We then use
modular transformations to generate from this theory effective descriptions for
transitions between a large class of fractional quantum Hall states whose
quasiparticle excitations have Abelian statistics. We find the correlation

ergodicity breaking and maintaining forever a local memory of its initial
conditions. We generalize this concept to a system of extended objects, such as
strings and membranes, arguing that such a system can also exhibit localization
in the presence of sufficiently strong disorder (randomness) in the
Hamiltonian. We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped
to a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a
string involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the
different segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all
such internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the
localization of the entire string. The eigenstates of the system can then be
constructed perturbatively through a convergent 'string locator expansion.' We
propose a type of out-of-time-order string correlator as a diagnostic of such a
string localized phase. Localization of other higher-dimensional objects, such
as membranes, can also be studied through a hierarchical construction by
mapping onto localization of lower-dimensional objects. Our arguments are
'asymptotic' ($i.e.$ valid up to rare regions) but they extend the notion of
localization (and localization protected order) to a host of settings where
such ideas previously did not apply. These include high-dimensional
ferromagnets with domain wall excitations, three-dimensional topological phases
with loop-like excitations, and three-dimensional type-II superconductors with
flux line excitations. In type-II superconductors, localization of flux lines
could stabilize superconductivity at energy densities where a normal state
would arise in thermal equilibrium.

amendable to any parameterization of subhalo density profile and mass function,
to probe dark matter on these scales with quadrupole image lenses. We consider
a warm dark matter particle with a mass function characterized by a
normalization and free streaming scale $m_{\rm{hm}}$. We forecast bounds on
dark matter warmth for 120-180 lenses, attainable with future surveys, at
typical lens (source) redshifts of 0.5 (1.5) in early-type galaxies with
velocity dispersions of 220-270 km/sec. We demonstrate that limits on
$m_{\rm{hm}}$ deteriorate rapidly with increasing uncertainty in image fluxes,
underscoring the importance of precise measurements and accurate lens models.
For our forecasts, we assume the deflectors in the lens sample do not exhibit
complex morphologies, so we neglect systematic errors in their modeling.
Omitting the additional signal from line of sight halos, our constraints
underestimate the true power of the method. Assuming cold dark matter, for a
low normalization, corresponding the destruction of all subhalos within the
host scale radius, we forecast $2\sigma$ bounds on $m_{\rm{hm}}$ (thermal relic

the circum-galactic medium. They are therefore crucial for galaxy formation,
but their driving mechanism is still poorly understood. Recent studies have
demonstrated that cosmic rays (CRs) can drive outflows if active CR transport
is taken into account. Using hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies
with virial masses between $10^{10}$ and $10^{13}\mathrm{~M_\odot}$, we study
how the properties of CR-driven winds depend on halo mass. CRs are treated in a
two-fluid approximation and their transport is modelled through isotropic or
anisotropic diffusion. We find that CRs are only able to drive mass-loaded
winds beyond the virial radius in haloes with masses below
$10^{12}\mathrm{~M_\odot}$. For our lowest examined halo mass, the wind is
roughly spherical and has velocities of $\sim20\mathrm{~km\;s^{-1}}$. With
increasing halo mass, the wind becomes biconical and can reach ten times higher
velocities. The mass loading factor drops rapidly with virial mass, a
dependence that approximately follows a power-law with a slope between $-1$ and
$-2$. This scaling is slightly steeper than observational inferences, and also
steeper than commonly used prescriptions for wind feedback in cosmological
simulations. The slope is quite robust to variations of the CR injection
efficiency or the CR diffusion coefficient. In contrast to the mass loading,
the energy loading shows no significant dependence on halo mass. While these
scalings are close to successful heuristic models of wind feedback, the
CR-driven winds in our present models are not yet powerful enough to fully
account for the required feedback strength.

Kepler mission. The wide wavelength baseline between the Kepler and GALEX data
provides a unique constraint on the nature of the variability. Using 1600
seconds of photon-counting data from four GALEX visits spread over 70 days in
2011, we find no coherent NUV variability in the system on 10-100 second or
months timescales. Comparing the integrated flux from these 2011 visits to the
2012 NUV flux published in the GALEX-CAUSE Kepler survey, we find a 3% decrease
in brightness for KIC 8462852. We find this level of variability is
significant, but not necessarily unusual for stars of similar spectral type in
the GALEX data. This decrease coincides with the secular optical fading
reported by Montet & Simon (2016). We find the multi-wavelength variability is
somewhat inconsistent with typical interstellar dust absorption, but instead
favors a R$_V$ = 5.0 $\pm$ 0.9 reddening law potentially from circumstellar
dust.

system MV Lyrae (hereafter MV Lyr), whose lightcurve displayed quasi-periodic
bursts of $\approx 30$ minutes duration every $\approx 2$ hours. The
observations indicate the presence of an unstable magnetically-regulated
accretion mode, revealing the existence of magnetically gated accretion, where
disk material builds up around the magnetospheric boundary (at the co-rotation
radius) and then accretes onto the white dwarf, producing bursts powered by the
release of gravitational potential energy. We infer a surface magnetic field
strength for the white dwarf in MV Lyr between $2 \times 10^4 \leq B \leq 10^5$
Gauss, too low to be detectable by other current methods. Our discovery
provides a new way of studying the strength and evolution of magnetic fields in
accreting white dwarfs and extends the connections between accretion onto white

errors in quantum logic operations is at odds with realistic environments where
error-sources may exhibit strong temporal correlations. We present experiments
enabling the identification of error correlations between operations in quantum
circuits, using only projective measurements at the end of the circuit. Using a
single trapped ion qubit and engineered noise with tunable temporal
correlations, we identify a clear signature of error correlations between
sequential gates in randomly composed quantum circuits, and extract
quantitative measures linked to the underlying noise correlation length. By
replacing all gates in these circuits with ""virtual"" dynamically corrected
gates (DCGs), we demonstrate that even in the presence of strongly correlated
noise the signatures of error correlations between sequential gates appear
similar to standard gates exposed to uncorrelated noise. A theoretical model
applied to our experiments reveals that common DCGs suppress the correlated
error component by over $270\times$ with $95\%$ confidence. Using
block-correlated noise, we explore the scaling of the effective error
correlation length at the virtual level, and show that DCGs exhibit error
correlations indistinguishable from those arising from uncorrelated noise.

that describes the evaporation of a black hole. A global wave function which
initially describes a classical Schwarzschild geometry is continually decohered
into distinct semiclassical branches by the emission of Hawking radiation. The
laws of quantum mechanics dictate that the wave function evolves unitarily, but
this unitary evolution is only manifest when considering the global description
of the wave function; it is not implemented by time evolution on a single
semiclassical branch. Conversely, geometric notions like the position or
smoothness of a horizon only make sense on the level of individual branches. We
consider the implications of this picture for probes of black holes by
classical observers in definite geometries, like those involved in the AMPS
construction. We argue that individual branches can describe semiclassical
geometries free of firewalls, even as the global wave function evolves
unitarily. We show that the pointer states of infalling detectors that are
robust under Hamiltonian evolution are distinct from, and incompatible with,
those of exterior detectors stationary with respect to the black hole horizon,
in the sense that the pointer bases are related to each other via nontrivial
transformations that mix the system, apparatus, and environment. This result
describes a Hilbert-space version of black hole complementarity.

stars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information
regarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and
the characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical
structures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal
even if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from
free electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across
the bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,
composition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the
structure. In this paper we use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SLIP to
investigate the polarization created when photons scatter in a bow shock-shaped
region of enhanced density surrounding a stellar source. We present results
assuming electron scattering, and investigate the polarization behaviour as a
function of optical depth, temperature, and source of photons for two different
cases: pure scattering and scattering with absorption. In both regimes we
consider resolved and unresolved cases. We discuss the implication of these

allows for seamless compatibility between the two layers of the optimization. A
key feature of the proposed work is that it offloads most of the responsibility
of collision avoidance to velocity optimization layer for which computationally
efficient formulations can be derived. In particular, we extend our previously
developed concept of time scaled collision cone (TSCC) constraints and
formulate the forward velocity optimization layer as a convex quadratic
programming problem. We perform validation on autonomous driving scenarios
wherein proposed MPC repeatedly solves both the optimization layers in receding
horizon manner to compute lane change, overtaking and merging maneuvers among
multiple dynamic obstacles.

The eruption is currently in a relatively constant plateau phase, with
photometric and spectroscopic variability superimposed. Here we will
characterize the progenitor of the outbursting object, explore its environment,
and analyse the temporal evolution of the eruption. We are particularly
interested in the physical origin of the two deep photometric dips, one
occurred in 2012, and one is ongoing since 2016. We collected archival
photographic plates, and carried out new optical, infrared, and millimeter wave
photometric and spectroscopic observations between 2010 and 2017, with high
sampling rate during the current minimum. Beside analysing the color changes
during fading, we compiled multiepoch spectral energy distributions, and fitted
them with a simple accretion disk model. Based on pre-outburst data and a
millimeter continuum measurement, we suggest that the progenitor of the V582
Aur outburst is a low-mass T Tauri star with average properties. The mass of an
unresolved circumstellar structure, probably a disk, is 0.04 M$_{\odot}$. The
optical and near-infrared spectra demonstrate the presence of hydrogen and
metallic lines, show the CO bandhead in absorption, and exhibit a variable
H$\alpha$ profile. The color variations strongly indicate that both the $\sim$1
year long brightness dip in 2012, and the current minimum since 2016 are caused
by increased extinction along the line of sight. According to our accretion
disk models, the reddening changed from $A_V$=4.5 mag to 12.5 mag, while the
accretion rate remained practically constant. Similarly to the models of the
UXor phenomenon of intermediate and low-mass young stars, orbiting disk
structures could be responsible for the eclipses.

Hamiltonian systems. We study the long-time numerical energy conservation not
only for symmetric integrators but also for symplectic integrators. In the
analysis, we neither assume symplecticity for symmetric methods, nor assume
symmetry for symplectic methods. It turns out that these both kinds of ERKN
integrators have a near conservation of the total and oscillatory energy over a
long term. To prove the result for symmetric integrators, a relationship
between symmetric ERKN integrators and trigonometric integrators is established
by using Strang splitting and based on this connection, the long-time
conservation is derived. For the long-term analysis of symplectic ERKN
integrators, the above approach does not work anymore and we use the technology
of modulated Fourier expansion developed in SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 38 (2000) by
Hairer and Lubich. By taking some novel adaptations of this essential
technology for non-symmetric methods, we derive the modulated Fourier expansion
for symplectic ERKN integrators. Moreover, it is shown that the symplectic ERKN
integrators have two almost-invariants and then the near energy conservation
over a long term is obtained.

We find that for five or less space dimensions, the fractal dimension is less

Bitsakis et al. (2017). Our code detects 1319 star clusters in the central 18
deg$^{2}$ of the SMC we surveyed (1108 of which have never been reported
before). The age distribution of those clusters suggests enhanced cluster
formation around 240 Myr ago. It also implies significant differences in the
cluster distribution of the bar with respect to the rest of the galaxy, with
the younger clusters being predominantly located in the bar. Having used the
same set-up, and data from the same surveys as for our previous study of the
LMC, we are able to robustly compare the cluster properties between the two
galaxies. Our results suggest that the bulk of the clusters in both galaxies
were formed approximately 300 Myr ago, probably during a direct collision
between the two galaxies. On the other hand, the locations of the young
($\le$50 Myr) clusters in both Magellanic Clouds, found where their bars join
the HI arms, suggest that cluster formation in those regions is a result of
internal dynamical processes. Finally, we discuss the potential causes of the
apparent outside-in quenching of cluster formation that we observe in the SMC.
Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary scheme where the interactions
between the Magellanic Clouds constitute the major mechanism driving their
overall evolution.

collision free trajectories for nonholonomic curvature bounded vehicles among
static and dynamic obstacles. One of the key novelties of our formulation is a
hierarchal optimization routine which alternately operates in the space of
angular accelerations and linear velocities. That is, the optimization has a
two layer structure wherein angular accelerations are optimized keeping the
linear velocities fixed and vice versa. If the vehicle/obstacles are modeled as
circles than the velocity optimization layer can be shown to have the
computationally efficient difference of convex structure commonly observed for
linear systems. This leads to a less conservative approximation as compared to
that obtained by approximating each polygon individually through its
circumscribing circle. On the other hand, it leads to optimization problem with
less number of constraints as compared to that obtained when approximating
polygons as multiple overlapping circles. We use the proposed trajectory
optimization as the basis for constructing a Model Predictive Control framework
for navigating an autonomous car in complex scenarios like overtaking, lane
changing and merging. Moreover, we also highlight the advantages provided by
the alternating optimization routine. Specifically, we show it produces
trajectories which have comparable arc lengths and smoothness as compared to
those produced with joint simultaneous optimization in the space of angular
accelerations and linear velocities. However, importantly, the alternating

renormalized quark masses and other properties of heavy-light mesons. In the
context of lattice QCD, for example, it is possible to calculate hadronic
quantities for arbitrary values of the quark masses. In this paper, we address
two aspects relating heavy-light meson masses to the quark masses. First, we
introduce a definition of the renormalized quark mass that is free of both
scale dependence and renormalon ambiguities, and discuss its relation to more
familiar definitions of the quark mass. We then show how this definition enters
a merger of the descriptions of heavy-light masses in heavy-quark effective
theory and in chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT). For practical
implementations of this merger, we extend the one-loop $\chi$PT corrections to
lattice gauge theory with heavy-light mesons composed of staggered fermions for
both quarks. Putting everything together, we obtain a practical formula to
describe all-staggered heavy-light meson masses in terms of quark masses as
well as some lattice artifacts related to staggered fermions. In a companion
paper, we use this function to analyze lattice-QCD data and extract quark
masses and some matrix elements defined in heavy-quark effective theory.

of DRAM and persistence like that of disks. Thus, it would also provide
significant performance benefits for big data applications by allowing
in-memory processing of large data with the lowest latency to persistence.
Leveraging the performance benefits of this memory-centric computing technology
through traditional memory programming is not trivial and the challenges
aggravate for parallel/concurrent applications. To this end, several
programming abstractions have been proposed like NVthreads, Mnemosyne and
intel's NVML. However, deciding upon a programming abstraction which is easier
to program and at the same time ensures the consistency and balances various
software and architectural trade-offs is openly debatable and active area of
research for NVM community.
  We study the NVthreads, Mnemosyne and NVML libraries by building a concurrent
and persistent set and open addressed hash-table data structure application. In
this process, we explore and report various tradeoffs and hidden costs involved
in building concurrent applications for persistence in terms of achieving
efficiency, consistency and ease of programming with these NVM programming
abstractions. Eventually, we evaluate the performance of the set and hash-table
data structure applications. We observe that NVML is easiest to program with
but is least efficient and Mnemosyne is most performance friendly but involves
significant programming efforts to build concurrent and persistent
applications.

that a system of rings exists around Chiron. In this work, we study the
dynamical history of the proposed Chiron ring system by integrating nearly
36,000 clones of the Centaur backward in time for 100 Myr under the influence
of the Sun and the four giant planets. The severity of all close encounters
between the clones and planets while the clones are in the Centaur region is
recorded, along with the mean time between close encounters. We find that
severe and extreme close encounters are very rare, making it possible that the
Chiron ring system has remained intact since its injection into the Centaur
region, which we find likely occurred within the past 8.5 Myr. Our simulations
yield a backward dynamical half-life for Chiron of 0.7 Myr. The dynamical
classes of a sample of clones are found. It is found that, on average, the
Centaur lifetimes of resonance hopping clones are twice those of random-walk
clones because of resonance sticking in mean motion resonances. In addition, we
present MEGNO and chaotic lifetime maps of the region bound by 13 au $\le a

are explored; GCNNreg-DDGF is a regular GCNN-DDGF model which contains the
convolution and feedforward blocks, and GCNNrec-DDGF additionally contains a
recurrent block from the Long Short-term Memory neural network architecture to
capture temporal dependencies in the bike-sharing demand series. Furthermore,
four types of GCNN models are proposed whose adjacency matrices are based on
various bike-sharing system data, including Spatial Distance matrix (SD),
Demand matrix (DE), Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD), and Demand Correlation
matrix (DC). These six types of GCNN models and seven other benchmark models
are built and compared on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes
272 stations and over 28 million transactions from 2013 to 2016. Results show
that the GCNNrec-DDGF performs the best in terms of the Root Mean Square Error,
the Mean Absolute Error and the coefficient of determination (R2), followed by
the GCNNreg-DDGF. They outperform the other models. Through a more detailed
graph network analysis based on the learned DDGF, insights are obtained on the
black box of the GCNN-DDGF model. It is found to capture some information
similar to details embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices. More importantly, it
also uncovers hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that

is possible to induce local spatial variations of magnetic properties in

comprised of virtually independent segments that exhibit ""local"" Curie
temperatures. Such localization of thermodynamic behavior leads to boundaries
between strongly and weakly magnetized regions that can be controllably moved
within the material with temperature. The utility of this interesting
functionality is largely dependent on the inherent spatial resolution of
magnetic properties - specifically the distance over which the exchange
strength and corresponding properties behave locally. To test the degree to
which this type of localization can be realized in materials, we have
fabricated epitaxial films of Co[1-x]Ru[x] alloy featuring a nanometer scale
triangular wave-like concentration depth profile. Continuous nanoscale
modulation of the local Curie temperature was observed using polarized neutron
reflectometry. These results are consistent with mean-field simulations of spin
systems that encompass the possibility of delocalized exchange coupling, and
show that composition grading can be used to localize magnetic properties in
films down to the nanometer level. Since this is demonstrated here for an
itinerant metal, we assert that for virtually any modulated magnetic material
system, collective effects can be suppressed to length scales smaller than
about 3 nm, so that magnetic behavior overall can be well described in terms of

the context of a binary-driven hypernova (BdHN). The afterglows originate from
the interaction between a newly born neutron star ($\nu$NS), created by an Ic
supernova (SN), and a mildly relativistic ejecta of a hypernova (HN). Such a HN
in turn results from the impact of the GRB on the original SN Ic. The mildly
relativistic expansion velocity of the afterglow ($\Gamma \sim 3$) is
determined, using our model independent approach, from the thermal emission
between $196$~s and $461$~s. The power-law in the optical and X-ray bands of
the afterglow is shown to arise from the synchrotron emission of relativistic
electrons in the expanding magnetized HN ejecta. Two components contribute to
the injected energy: the kinetic energy of the mildly relativistic expanding HN
and the rotational energy of the fast rotating highly magnetized $\nu$NS. We
reproduce the afterglow in all wavelengths from the optical ($10^{14}$~Hz) to
the X-ray band ($10^{19}$~Hz) over times from $604$~s to $5.18\times 10^6$~s
relative to the Fermi-GBM trigger. Initially, the emission is dominated by the
loss of kinetic energy of the HN component. After $10^5$~s the emission is
dominated by the loss of rotational energy of the $\nu$NS, for which we adopt
an initial rotation period of $2$~ms and a dipole plus quadrupole magnetic
field of $\lesssim \! 7\times 10^{12}$~G or $\sim \! 10^{14}$~G. This scenario
with a progenitor composed of a CO$_{\rm core}$ and a NS companion differs from

ejecta onto the NS leads to its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH),
to the emission of the GRB and to a copious $e^+e^-$ plasma. The impact of this
$e^+e^-$ plasma on the SN ejecta explains {the} early soft X-ray flare observed
in long GRBs. We here apply this approach to the UPE and to the hard X-ray
flares. We use GRB 151027A as a prototype. From the time-integrated and the
time-resolved analysis we identify a double component in the UPE and confirm
its ultra-relativistic nature. We confirm the mildly-relativistic nature of the
soft X-ray flare, of the hard X-ray flare and of the ETE. We show that the ETE
identifies the transition from a SN to the HN. We then address the theoretical
justification of these observations by integrating the hydrodynamical
propagation equations of the $e^+ e^-$ into the SN ejecta, the latter
independently obtained from 3D smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations. We
conclude that the UPE, the hard X-ray flare and the soft X-ray flare do not
form a causally connected sequence: Within our model they are the manifestation
of \textbf{the same} physical process of the BH formation as seen through

language as we can observe it should never have existed or should have been

is still missing. The solution I propose consists in regarding language as a
social signaling device that developed in a context of generalized insecurity

compatible with many characteristics of language that otherwise are left

developing a novel framework for multiple testing of hypotheses grouped in a

(Lfdr's). It is built on an extension of the standard two-class mixture model
from single to multiple groups, defining hypothesis-specific Lfdr as a function
of the conditional Lfdr for the hypothesis given that it is within an important
group and the Lfdr for the group itself and involving a new parameter that
measures grouping effect. This definition captures the underlying group
structure for the hypotheses belonging to a group more effectively than the
standard two-class mixture model. Two new Lfdr based methods, possessing
meaningful optimalities, are produced in their oracle forms. One, designed to
control false discoveries across the entire collection of hypotheses, is
proposed as a powerful alternative to simply pooling all the hypotheses into a
single group and using commonly used Lfdr based method under the standard
single-group two-class mixture model. The other is proposed as an Lfdr analog
of the method of Benjamini and Bogomolov (2014) for selective inference. It
controls Lfdr based measure of false discoveries associated with selecting
groups concurrently with controlling the average of within-group false
discovery proportions across the selected groups. Simulation studies and
real-data application show that our proposed methods are often more powerful
than their relevant competitors.

that sizeable interference effects between a {\sl heavy} charged Higgs boson
signal produced via $bg\to tH^-$ (+ c.c.) scattering and decaying via $H^-\to
W^- A\to W^- b\bar b$ (+ c.c.) and the irreducible background given by $bg\to t
W^- b\bar b$ topologies could spoil current search approaches where the former
and latter channels are treated separately. The rationale for this comes from
the fact that a heavy charged Higgs state can have a large width, and so can
happen for the CP-odd neutral Higgs state emerging in the ensuing decays well,
which in turn enables such interferences. We conclude that effects are very
significant, both at the inclusive and exclusive level (i.e., both before and
after $H^\pm$ selection cuts are enforced, respectively) and typically of a
destructive nature. This therefore implies that currently established LHC
reaches for heavy charged Higgs bosons require some level of rescaling.
However, this is possible a posteriori, as the aforementioned $H^\pm$ selection
cuts shape the interference contributions at the differential level in a way
similar to that of the isolated $H^\pm$ signal, so there is no need to reassess
the efficiency of the individual cuts. We show such effects quantitatively by
borrowing benchmarks points from different Yukawa types of a 2-Higgs Doublet
Model parameter space for $H^\pm$ values starting from around 200 GeV.

through time-resolved photoresponse to optical pulses. The excess
magnetoconductivity is interpreted in terms of the weak-localization effect and
superconducting fluctuations. Aslamazov-Larkin, and Maki-Thompson
superconducting fluctuation alone fail to reproduce the magnetic field
dependence in the relatively high magnetic field range when the temperature is
rather close to Tc because the suppression of the electronic density of states
due to the formation of short lifetime Cooper pairs needs to be considered. The
time scale {\tau}_i of inelastic scattering is ascribed to a combination of
electron-electron ({\tau}_(e-e)) and electron-phonon ({\tau}_(e-ph))
interaction times, and a characteristic electron-fluctuation time
({\tau}_(e-fl)), which makes it possible to extract their magnitudes and
temperature dependences from the measured {\tau}_i. The ratio of
phonon-electron ({\tau}_(ph-e)) and electron-phonon interaction times is
obtained via measurements of the optical photoresponse of WSi microbridges.
Relatively large {\tau}_(e-ph)/{\tau}_(ph-e) and {\tau}_(e-ph)/{\tau}_(e-e)

method for nucleus segmentation using images from four cancer types. When no

leads to a finite local density states at the Fermi energy in both orbitals
when at least one band is metallic. When one band is doped, and the chemical
potential lies between the Hubbard bands in the other band, the coherent
quasiparticle peak in this orbital has an exponential behavior with the Hubbard

metal state of the high temperature superconductors, and its
linear-in-temperature, $T$, resistivity. Recent experiments showing an
unexpected linear-in-field, $B$, magnetoresistivity have deepened the puzzle.
We propose a simple model of itinerant electrons, interacting via random
couplings with electrons localized on a lattice of quantum 'dots' or 'islands'.
This model is solvable in a large-$N$ limit, and can reproduce observed
behavior. The key feature of our model is that the electrons in each quantum
dot are described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing electrons without
quasiparticle excitations. For a particular choice of the interaction between
the itinerant and localized electrons, this model realizes a controlled
description of a diffusive marginal-Fermi liquid (MFL) without momentum
conservation, which has a linear-in-$T$ resistivity and a $T \ln T$ specific
heat as $T\rightarrow 0$. By tuning the strength of this interaction relative
to the bandwidth of the itinerant electrons, we can additionally obtain a
finite-$T$ crossover to a fully incoherent regime that also has a linear-in-$T$
resistivity. We show that the MFL regime has conductivities which scale as a
function of $B/T$; however, its magnetoresistance saturates at large $B$. We
then consider a macroscopically disordered sample with domains of MFLs with
varying densities of electrons. Using an effective-medium approximation, we
obtain a macroscopic electrical resistance that scales linearly in the magnetic
field $B$ applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample, at large $B$. The
resistance also scales linearly in $T$ at small $B$, and as $T f(B/T)$ at
intermediate $B$. We consider implications for recent experiments reporting
linear transverse magnetoresistance in the strange metal phases of the
pnictides and cuprates.

the case of data near the bottom of eclipses instead of wider intervals of the

of transit eclipses, especially by exoplanets. Other two methods, as well as
the symmetrical polynomials of statistically optimal order, may be recommended

simplicity, I calculate the feasible set of market timing portfolios using
index mutual fund data for perfectly timed (by hindsight) all or nothing
quarterly switching between two asset classes, US stocks and bonds over the
time period 1993--2017. The historical optimal timing path of switches is shown
to be indistinguishable from a random sequence. The key result is that the
probability distribution function of market timing returns is asymetric, that
the highest probability outcome for market timing is a below median return. Put
another way, simple math says market timing is more likely to lose than to
win---even before accounting for costs. The median of the market timing return
probability distribution can be directly calculated as a weighted average of
the returns of the model assets with the weights given by the fraction of time
each asset has a higher return than the other. For the time period of the data
the median return was close to, but not identical with, the return of a static
60:40 stock:bond portfolio. These results are illustrated through Monte Carlo

determining the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a competitive precision. However,
the tension with $H_0$ obtained from the Planck satellite for a spatially-flat
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology suggests that systematic errors may have been
underestimated. The most critical one probably comes from the degeneracy
existing between lens models that was first formalized by the well-known
mass-sheet transformation (MST). In this paper, we assess to what extent the
source position transformation (SPT), a more general invariance transformation
which contains the MST as a special case, may affect the time delays predicted
by a model. To this aim we use pySPT, a new open-source python package fully
dedicated to the SPT that we present in a companion paper. For axisymmetric
lenses, we find that the time delay ratios between a model and its SPT-modified
counterpart simply scale like the corresponding source position ratios, $\Delta
\hat{t}/ \Delta t \approx \hat{\beta}/\beta$, regardless of the mass profile
and the isotropic SPT. Similar behavior (almost) holds for non-axisymmetric
lenses in the double image regime and for opposite image pairs in the quadruple
image regime. In the latter regime, we also confirm that the time delay ratios
are not conserved. In addition to the MST effects, the SPT-modified time delays
deviate in general no more than a few percent for particular image pairs,
suggesting that its impact on time-delay cosmography seems not be as crucial as
initially suspected. We also reflected upon the relevance of the SPT validity
criterion and present arguments suggesting that it should be reconsidered. Even
though a new validity criterion would affect the time delays in a different
way, we expect from numerical simulations that our conclusions will remain
unchanged.

electronic structure theory methods due to the proximity of two low-energy

that, at the triple-zeta basis set level, all sCI results --- including those
extrapolated at the full CI (FCI) limit --- disagree with experiment, yielding
an electronic ground state of $^{5}\Sigma^+$ symmetry. Performing FN-DMC

statistical methods to infer complex demographic histories from DNA sequence
data. Most, if not all, of these inference methods exhibit pathological
behavior, however. Specifically, they often display runaway behavior in
optimization, where the inferred population sizes and epoch durations can
degenerate to 0 or diverge to infinity, and show undesirable sensitivity of the
inferred demography to perturbations in the data. The goal of this paper is to
provide theoretical insights into why such problems arise. To this end, we
characterize the geometry of the expected SFS for piecewise-constant
demographic histories and use our results to show that the aforementioned
pathological behavior of popular inference methods is intrinsic to the geometry
of the expected SFS. We provide explicit descriptions and visualizations for a
toy model with sample size 4, and generalize our intuition to arbitrary sample
sizes n using tools from convex and algebraic geometry. We also develop a
universal characterization result which shows that the expected SFS of a sample
of size n under an arbitrary population history can be recapitulated by a
piecewise-constant demography with only k(n) epochs, where k(n) is between n/2

fewer than k(n) epochs is open and non-convex, which causes the above phenomena

We present a statistical mechanical theory of effective electrostatic

procedure, we show that a multicomponent mixture of charged colloids,
nanoparticles, counterions, and coions can be mapped first onto a binary
mixture of colloids and nanoparticles and then onto a one-component model of
colloids alone. In a linear-response approximation, the one-component model is
governed by a single effective pair potential and a one-body volume energy,
whose parameters depend nontrivially on nano particle size, charge, and
concentration. To test the theory, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of
the two-component and one-component models and compute structural properties.
For moderate electrostatic couplings, colloid-colloid radial distribution
functions and static structure factors agree closely between the two models,
validating the sequential coarse-graining approach. Nanoparticles of sufficient

weakening correlations between charged colloids and destabilizing suspensions,

model of polarized PAH emission is presented, taking into account the effect of
PAH alignment with the magnetic field. The polarization level of PAH emission
features, for the different phases of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is
discussed. We find that negatively charged smallest PAHs in the reflection
nebula can be excited to slightly suprathermal rotation due to enhanced ion
collisional excitation, which enhances the degree of PAH alignment and the
polarization level of PAH emission. The polarization level and polarization
angle predicted by our model including PAH alignment are supported by the first
detection of the polarization of $p\sim 2\%$ at 11.3 $\mu$m PAH feature from

meaningful representation refers to the one that gives rise to significant
performance improvement of associated Machine Learning (ML) tasks by replacing
the raw data as the input. However, optimal architecture design and model
parameter estimation in DL algorithms are widely considered to be intractable.
Evolutionary algorithms are much preferable for complex and non-convex problems
due to its inherent characteristics of gradient-free and insensitivity to local
optimum. In this paper, we propose a computationally economical algorithm for
evolving \emph{unsupervised deep neural networks} to efficiently learn
\emph{meaningful representations}, which is very suitable in the current Big
Data era where sufficient labeled data for training is often expensive to
acquire. In the proposed algorithm, finding an appropriate architecture and the
initialized parameter values for a ML task at hand is modeled by one
computational efficient gene encoding approach, which is employed to
effectively model the task with a large number of parameters. In addition, a
local search strategy is incorporated to facilitate the exploitation search for
further improving the performance. Furthermore, a small proportion labeled data
is utilized during evolution search to guarantee the learnt representations to
be meaningful. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been thoroughly
investigated over classification tasks. Specifically, error classification rate
on MNIST with $1.15\%$ is reached by the proposed algorithm consistently, which
is a very promising result against state-of-the-art unsupervised DL algorithms.

be possible in the era of \emph{Gaia}. These will be comparable in precision to
those obtained with double-lined EBs. Moreover, the systems for which these
methods can be applied will vastly outnumber double-lined EBs, thereby
possessing the potential to sample a more complete range of stellar types (such
as M dwarfs); these systems will also, in many cases, be more amenable to

Utilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are

other cell types: run and tumble behavior with L\'{e}vy-distributed run times,
and ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We
develop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the
predictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities
such as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions
are equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures
the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability
distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that
includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs,
which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the
run times are not L\'{e}vy distributed. The analysis tools developed here
should be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for
superdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.

show that the correlation functions of the stresses acting on the same plate

much weaker power-law decays in the large separation regime, with exponents
-3/2 (excess self-correlator on the mobile plate) and -1 (cross-correlator).
The self-correlator on the fixed plate increases and levels off upon increasing

competition of simple and complex contagion, meaning that while some agents
follow simple contagion, others follow complex contagion. Simple contagion
refers to spreading processes induced by a single exposure to a contagious
entity while complex contagion demands multiple exposures for transmission.
Inspired by this observation, we propose a model of contagion dynamics with a
transmission probability that initiates a process of complex contagion. With
this probability nodes subject to simple contagion get adopted and trigger a
process of complex contagion. We obtain a phase diagram in the parameter space
of the transmission probability and the fraction of nodes subject to complex
contagion. Our contagion model exhibits a rich variety of phase transitions
such as continuous, discontinuous, and hybrid phase transitions, criticality,
tricriticality, and double transitions. In particular, we find a double phase
transition showing a continuous transition and a following discontinuous
transition in the density of adopted nodes with respect to the transmission
probability. We show that the double transition occurs with an intermediate
phase in which nodes following simple contagion become adopted but nodes with
complex contagion remain susceptible.

superstring loops is qualitatively distinct because the string tension is
exponentially smaller than the string scale in flux compactifications in string
theory. Low tension superstring loops live longer, experience less recoil

cluster like dark matter in galaxies. Clustering enhances the string loop

uptake and removal than does the more usual non-cooperative (Langmuir-type)

attributed to a phase transition of the framework. However, the class of
metal-organic frameworks mmen-M$_2$(dobpdc) exhibit cooperative adsorption of
CO2 but show no evidence of a phase transition. Here we show how cooperativity
emerges in these frameworks in the absence of a phase transition. We use a
combination of quantum and statistical mechanics to show that cooperativity
results from a sharp but finite increase, with pressure, of the mean length of
chains of CO2 molecules that polymerize within the framework. Our study
provides microscopic understanding of the emergent features of cooperative
binding, including the position, slope and height of the isotherm step, and
indicates how to optimize gas storage and separation in these materials.

compare them among three galaxies in order to investigate the chemical
signatures of an AGN environment. As a result, we found clear trends on the
abundances of molecules surrounding the AGN on 1 kpc scale. HCN, H13CN, CN,
13CN, and HC3N are more abundant, and CH3CCH is deficient in NGC 1068 compared

that the circumnuclear disk in NGC 1068 is in a high-temperature environment.
The reason for the non-detection of CH3CCH is likely to be dissociation by high

monitoring tools which can correctly identify any abnormal data stream for such
data are highly sought after. However, most of the existing monitoring
procedures directly apply the false discover rate (FDR) controlling procedure
to the data at each time point, and the FDR at each time point (the point-wise
FDR) is either specified by users or determined by the in-control (IC) average
run length (ARL). If the point-wise FDR is specified by users, the resulting
procedure lacks control of the global FDR and keeps users in the dark in terms
of the IC-ARL. If the point-wise FDR is determined by the IC-ARL, the resulting
procedure does not give users the flexibility to choose the number of false
alarms (Type-I errors) they can tolerate when identifying abnormal data
streams, which often makes the procedure too conservative. To address those
limitations, we propose a two-stage monitoring procedure that can control both
the IC-ARL and Type-I errors at the levels specified by users. As a result, the
proposed procedure allows users to choose not only how often they expect any
false alarms when all data streams are IC, but also how many false alarms they
can tolerate when identifying abnormal data streams. With this extra
flexibility, our proposed two-stage monitoring procedure is shown in the
simulation study and real data analysis to outperform the exiting methods.

detailed 3D results, but typically only for near frontal, unobstructed
viewpoints. We describe a system designed to provide detailed 3D
reconstructions of faces viewed under extreme conditions, out of plane
rotations, and occlusions. Motivated by the concept of bump mapping, we propose
a layered approach which decouples estimation of a global shape from its
mid-level details (e.g., wrinkles). We estimate a coarse 3D face shape which
acts as a foundation and then separately layer this foundation with details
represented by a bump map. We show how a deep convolutional encoder-decoder can
be used to estimate such bump maps. We further show how this approach naturally
extends to generate plausible details for occluded facial regions. We test our
approach and its components extensively, quantitatively demonstrating the
invariance of our estimated facial details. We further provide numerous
qualitative examples showing that our method produces detailed 3D face shapes
in viewing conditions where existing state of the art often break down.

However, most learning methods rely on models with a fixed structure and
complexity. In this paper, we present a self-supervised framework for robots to
learn to navigate, without any prior knowledge of the environment, by
incrementally building the structure of a deep network as new data becomes
available. Our framework captures images from a monocular camera and self
labels the images to continuously train and predict actions from a
computationally efficient adaptive deep architecture based on Autoencoders
(AE), in a self-supervised fashion. The deep architecture, named Reinforced
Adaptive Denoising Autoencoders (RA-DAE), uses reinforcement learning to
dynamically change the network structure by adding or removing neurons.
Experiments were conducted in simulation and real-world indoor and outdoor
environments to assess the potential of self-supervised navigation. RA-DAE
demonstrates better performance than equivalent non-adaptive deep learning
alternatives and can continue to expand its knowledge, trading-off past and

data-driven analysis remains an open challenge. We demonstrate an application
of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) with sparse sampling for the diagnostic
analysis of multiscale physics. The DMD method is an ideal spatiotemporal
matrix decomposition that correlates spatial features of computational or
experimental data to periodic temporal behavior. DMD can be modified into a
multiresolution analysis to separate complex dynamics into a hierarchy of
multiresolution timescale components, where each level of the hierarchy divides
dynamics into distinct background (slow) and foreground (fast) timescales. The
multiresolution DMD is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in
an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into
low-rank spatial modes and their temporal Fourier dynamics. Moreover, these
multiresolution DMD modes can be used to determined sparse sampling locations
which are nearly optimal for dynamic regime classification and full state
reconstruction. Specifically, optimized sensors are efficiently chosen using QR
column pivots of the DMD library, thus avoiding an NP-hard selection process.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on several examples, including global
sea-surface temperature data, and show that only a small number of sensors are
needed for accurate global reconstructions and classification of El Ni\~no
events.

this task, we hypothesize that one can leverage the property that the videos

then compressed and sent to the client together with the H.264 stream. In our

be directly stored in the memory without the need of latching the data and

flare activity, i.e., whether a confined or eruptive flare occurs. We analyzed
44 flares of GOES class M5.0 and larger that occurred during 2011--2015. We
used 3D potential magnetic field models to study their location (using the
flare distance from the flux-weighted AR center $d_{\mathrm{FC}}$) and the
strength of the magnetic field in the corona above (via decay index $n$ and
flux ratio). We also present a first systematic study of the orientation of the
coronal magnetic field, using the orientation $\varphi$ of the flare-relevant
polarity inversion line as a measure. We analyzed all quantities with respect
to the size of the underlying dipole field, characterized by the distance
between the opposite-polarity centers, $d_{\mathrm{PC}}$. Flares originating
from underneath the AR dipole $(d_{\mathrm{FC}}/d_{\mathrm{PC}}<0.5$) tend to
be eruptive if launched from compact ARs ($d_{\mathrm{PC}}\leq60$ Mm) and
confined if launched from extended ARs. Flares ejected from the periphery of
ARs ($d_{\mathrm{FC}}/d_{\mathrm{PC}}>0.5$) are predominantly eruptive. In
confined events the flare-relevant field adjusts its orientation quickly to
that of the underlying dipole with height ($\Delta\varphi\gtrsim40^\circ$ until
the apex of the dipole field), in contrast to eruptive events where it changes
more slowly with height. The critical height for torus instability,
$h_{\mathrm{crit}}=h(n=1.5)$, discriminates best between confined
($h_{\mathrm{crit}}\gtrsim40$ Mm) and eruptive flares
($h_{\mathrm{crit}}\lesssim40$ Mm). It discriminates better than
$\Delta\varphi$, implying that the decay of the confining field plays a
stronger role than its orientation at different heights.

spontaneously broken via the Fayet-Iliopoulos of $U(1)_A$ at the meta-stable
vacuum. In the global SUSY analysis, the gaugino masses become much smaller
than the sfermion masses, because an approximate R-symmetry appears at the SUSY
breaking vacuum. In this paper, we show that gaugino masses can be as large as
gravitino mass, taking the supergravity effect into consideration. This is
because the R-symmetry is not imposed so that the constant term in the
superpotential, which is irrelevant to the global SUSY analysis, largely
contributes to the soft SUSY breaking terms in the supergravity. As the
mediation mechanism, we introduce the contributions of the field not charged
under $U(1)_A$ and the moduli field to cancel the anomaly of $U(1)_A$. We
comment on the application of our SUSY breaking scenario to the GUT models.

is necessary to achieve a flexible combination of multiple behaviors. This is
because the design of task motions suited to each situation would become
increasingly difficult as the number of situations and the types of tasks
performed by them increase. To handle the switching and combination of multiple
behaviors, we propose a method to design dynamical systems based on point
attractors that accept (i) ""instruction signals"" for instruction-driven
switching. We incorporate the (ii) ""instruction phase"" to form a point
attractor and divide the target task into multiple subtasks. By forming an
instruction phase that consists of point attractors, the model embeds a subtask
in the form of trajectory dynamics that can be manipulated using sensory and
instruction signals. Our model comprises two deep neural networks: a
convolutional autoencoder and a multiple time-scale recurrent neural network.
In this study, we apply the proposed method to manipulate soft materials. To
evaluate our model, we design a cloth-folding task that consists of four
subtasks and three patterns of instruction signals, which indicate the
direction of motion. The results depict that the robot can perform the required
task by combining subtasks based on sensory and instruction signals. And, our
model determined the relations among these signals using its internal dynamics.

of complex networks. Majority of community detection methods rely on
optimization of certain quality functions characterizing the proposed community
structure. Perhaps, the most commonly used of those quality functions is
modularity. Many heuristics are claimed to be efficient in modularity
maximization, which is usually justified in relative terms through comparison
of their outcomes with those provided by other known algorithms. However as all
the approaches are heuristics, while the complete brute-force is not feasible,
there is no known way to understand if the obtained partitioning is really the
optimal one. In this article we address the modularity maximization problem
from the other side --- finding an upper-bound estimate for the possible
modularity values within a given network, allowing to better evaluate suggested
community structures. Moreover, in some cases when then upper bound estimate
meets the actually obtained modularity score, it provides a proof that the
suggested community structure is indeed the optimal one. We propose an
efficient algorithm for building such an upper-bound estimate and illustrate
its usage on the examples of well-known classical and synthetic networks, being
able to prove the optimality of the existing partitioning for some of the
networks including well-known Zachary's Karate Club.

by competing phases whose nature is often a mystery. Chiefly among them is the
pseudogap phase, which sets in at a doping $p^*$ that is material-dependent.
What determines $p^*$ is currently an open question. Here we show that the
pseudogap cannot open on an electron-like Fermi surface, and can only exist
below the doping $p_{FS}$ at which the large Fermi surface goes from hole-like
to electron-like, so that $p^*$ $\leq$ $p_{FS}$. We derive this result from
high-magnetic-field transport measurements in
La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ under pressure, which reveal a large and
unexpected shift of $p^*$ with pressure, driven by a corresponding shift in
$p_{FS}$. This necessary condition for pseudogap formation, imposed by details
of the Fermi surface, is a strong constraint for theories of the pseudogap
phase. Our finding that $p^*$ can be tuned with a modest pressure opens a new
route for experimental studies of the pseudogap.

opto-electronic devices. Oftentimes, the domain occupied by an organic

photoluminescence over the domain is measured and used as the observation data
to estimate this length parameter in an inverse manner based on the least
square method. However, the result is sometimes found to be sensitive to the
surface geometry of the domain. In this paper, we employ a random function
representation for the uncertain surface of the domain. After
non-dimensionalization, the forward model becomes a diffusion-type equation
over the domain whose geometric boundary is subject to small random
perturbations. We propose an asymptotic-based method as an approximate forward
solver whose accuracy is justified both theoretically and numerically. It only
requires solving several deterministic problems over a fixed domain. Therefore,
for the same accuracy requirements we tested here, the running time of our
approach is more than one order of magnitude smaller than that of directly
solving the original stochastic boundary-value problem by the stochastic
collocation method. In addition, from numerical results, we find that the
correlation length of randomness is important to determine whether a 1D reduced

deployment of small cells in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands has become a
promising candidate for next generation wireless communication systems. With a
greatly increased data rate from huge bandwidth of mmWave communications,
energy consumption should be mitigated for higher energy efficiency. Due to
content popularity, many content-based mobile applications can be supported by
the multicast service. mmWave communications exploit directional antennas to
overcome high path loss, and concurrent transmissions can be enabled for better
multicast service. On the other hand, device-to-device (D2D) communications in
physical proximity should be exploited to improve multicast performance. In
this paper, we propose an energy efficient multicast scheduling scheme,
referred to as EMS, which utilizes both D2D communications and concurrent
transmissions to achieve high energy efficiency. In EMS, a D2D path planning
algorithm establishes multi-hop D2D transmission paths, and a concurrent
scheduling algorithm allocates the links on the D2D paths into different
pairings. Then the transmission power of links is adjusted by the power control
algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the roles of D2D
communications and concurrent transmissions in reducing energy consumption.
Extensive simulations under various system parameters demonstrate the superior
performance of EMS in terms of energy consumption compared with the
state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, we also investigate the choice of the

insulator (TI) cause a finite lifetime of the topological surface states (TSS)
as shown by the recent experiments. On the other hand, interactions also induce
unitary processes, which, in the presence of anisotropy and the spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), can induce non-trivial effects on the spin texture. Recently,
such effects were observed experimentally in the $Bi_2X_3$ family, raising the
question that the hexagonal warping (HW) may be linked with new spin-related
anomalies. The most remarkable among which is the 6-fold periodic canting of
the in-plane spin vector. Here, we show that, this anomaly is the result of a
{\it triple cooperation between the interactions, the SOC and the HW}. To
demonstrate it, we formulate the spin-off-diagonal self energy. A unitary phase
with an even symmetry develops in the latter and modulates the spin-1/2 vortex
when the Fermi surface is anisotropic. When the anisotropy is provided by the
HW, a 6-fold in-plane spin-canting is observed. Our theory suggests that the
spin-canting anomaly in $Bi_2X_3$ is a strong evidence of the interactions.
High precision analysis of the spin-texture is a promising support for further
understanding of the interactions in TIs.

purposes of quantum computing robust to decoherence. One of the most expecting
but unachieved goals is an effective control for braiding of Majoranas. Another
one is to describe ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ topological semimetals, APRES spectra of
which testify on eight-fold degenerate chiral fermions with $SU(2)$ holonomy of
wave functions, whereas the last can not be reproduced within existing models.
Quasi-relativistic theory of non-abelian quantum charge transport in
topological semimetals is developed for a model with a number of flavors equal
three. Majorana-like quasi-particle excitations in the model are described with
accounting of dynamic mass term arising due to relativistic exchange
interactions. Such exotic features of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ semimetals as splitting
zero-conductance peaks, longitudinal magnetoresistance, minimal direct current
conductivity, negative differential conductivity have been calculated in
perfect agreement with experimental data. We propose a new scheme of braiding
for three flavor Majorana-like fermions with new non-trivial braiding operator.
We demonstrate that in this model, the presence of chiral Majorana-like bound
states is controlled as emergence of three pairs of resonance-antiresonance in
frequency dependence of dielectric permeability.

large uncertainty about the origin of the mid-infrared features, the lack of
absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared spectra, and the effects of
secondary processes on the moons' surface make the determination of their
composition very difficult from remote sensing data. Simulations suggest a
formation of a disk made of gas and melt with their composition linked to the

the composition of dust (condensates from gas) and solids (from a cooling melt)

highlight a local shift in the state space of the position of the edge state
relative to the laminar attractor with the consequent modulation of its basin
of attraction in the proximity of the edge state and of the surrounding
manifold. The implication is that the threshold for transition is reduced for
perturbations evolving in the neighbourhood of the edge state in case viscosity
decreases away from the walls, and vice versa.

demonstrate this mechanism within a simple toy model of fermionic dark matter

spectra ranging from radio through optical to X-ray band, with numerous

Boroson & Green (1992) were able to show significant correlations between the
measured parameters. Among the significant correlations projected, the leading
component, related to Eigenvector 1 (EV1) was dominated by the anti-correlation
between the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ optical emission and [OIII] line where the EV1
alone contained 30% of the total variance. This introduced a way to define a
quasar main sequence, in close analogy to the stellar main sequence in the
Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram (Sulentic et. al 2001). Which of the basic
theoretically motivated parameters of an active nucleus (Eddington ratio, black
hole mass, accretion rate, spin, and viewing angle) is the main driver behind
the EV1 yet remains to be answered. We currently limit ourselves to the optical
waveband, and concentrate on theoretical modelling the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to
H$\mathrm{\beta}$ ratio, and test the hypothesis that the physical driver of
EV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk temperature, reflected in the shape of
the spectral energy distribution (SED). We performed computations of the
H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and optical Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ for a broad range of SED peak
position using CLOUDY photoionisation code. We assumed that both
H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ emission come from the Broad Line

compare the results for two different approaches: (1) considering a fixed
bolometric luminosity for the SED; (2) considering $\mathrm{L_{bol}/L_{Edd}}$ =
1.

stochastically modeling the dynamics of a biallelic polymorphism herds under
conditions of controlled mating {and restriction of herds size from above}. The
system of stochastic differential equations that we propose is based on jump
diffusion processes to provide an effective platform for Monte Carlo
simulation. A feature of the model is the division of the {population} into a
{\it main herd} comprised of animals involved in the production process and a
{\it replacement herd} of {animals not currently in the production process,
typically juvenile animals}. This feature allows for exploring different
strategies for adding replacement animals to the main herd without altering the
part of the model concerned with the dynamics of the main herd. A discrete-time
version of the model has been developed which reflects the typical practice of
New Zealand dairy herd management. Our Monte Carlo simulation has demonstrated
that an isolated deme whose size is bounded above demonstrate size
stabilization at a level less than the control limit, it is looks like partial

of semi-bubble structure reduces this splitting, and we study its consequences
on the excitation spectrum of the nuclei under investigation by using a
quasi-particle random-phase-approximation approach. The excitation energies of
the low-lying $4^+$ states can be related to the presence of semi-bubble
structure in nuclei.

Ab initio nuclear structure theory provided the so far most precise estimates
of important corrections to the Lamb shift in muonic atoms and is well poised
to also investigate nuclear structure corrections to the hyperfine splitting in
muonic atoms. Independently on whether the puzzle is due to
beyond-the-standard-model physics or not, nuclear structure corrections are a
necessary theoretical input to any experimental extraction of electric and
magnetic radii from precise muonic atom measurements.
  Here, we review the status of the calculations performed by the TRIUMF-Hebrew
University group, focusing on the deuteron, and discuss preliminary results on
magnetic sum rules calculated with two-body currents at next-to-leading order.
Two-body currents will be an important ingredient in future calculations of
nuclear structure corrections to the hyperfine splitting in muonic atoms.

uncorrelated to a highly correlated state, which manifests itself in the
localization of the lattice atoms in the latter regime. For small interspecies

single-particle-like picture. Moreover, we give a full characterization of the
wave function's structure in both regimes, using Bloch and Wannier states of
the lowest band, and we find an order parameter, which can be exploited as a
corresponding experimental signature. To deepen the understanding, we use an
effective Hamiltonian approach, which introduces an induced interaction and is
valid for small interspecies interaction. We finally compare the ansatz of the

has resulted in the creation of numerous interestingness measures. This, in
turn, has motivated researchers to come up with various classification schemes
for these measures. One popular approach to classify the objective measures is
to assess the set of mathematical properties they satisfy in order to help
practitioners select the right measure for a given problem. In this research,
we discuss the insufficiency of the existing properties in literature to
capture certain behaviors of interestingness measures. This motivates us to
present a novel approach to analyze and classify measures. We refer to this as
a rate of change analysis (RCA). In this analysis a measure is described by how
it varies if there is a unit change in the frequency count
$(f_{11},f_{10},f_{01},f_{00})$, for different pre-existing states of the
frequency counts. More formally, we look at the first partial derivative of the
measure with respect to the various frequency count variables. We then use this
analysis to define two new properties, Unit-Null Asymptotic Invariance (UNAI)
and Unit-Null Zero Rate (UNZR). UNAI looks at the asymptotic effect of adding
frequency patterns, while UNZR looks at the initial effect of adding frequency
patterns when they do not pre-exist in the dataset. We present a comprehensive
analysis of 50 interestingness measures and classify them in accordance with
the two properties. We also present empirical studies, involving both synthetic
and real-world datasets, which are used to cluster various measures according
to the rule ranking patterns of the measures. The study concludes with the
observation that classification of measures using the empirical clusters share
significant similarities to the classification of measures done through the
properties presented in this research.

a complicated structure. We describe situations when the attractor is chaotic

data itself is not enough to determine music semantics. In this paper, we
propose a generic framework for semantics modeling that focuses on the

that forces the semantic embedding spaces of both views to be maximally
correlated. We also detail how the EEG dataset was collected and use it to

learning context, by using it as an audio feature extractor in an independent
dataset and proxy task: music audio-lyrics cross-modal retrieval. We show that
our embedding model outperforms Spotify features and performs comparably to a
state-of-the-art embedding model that was trained on 700 times more data. We
further discuss improvements to the model that are likely to improve its

variations, several areas can only be understood in terms of inhomogeneous

that the bright and dark material tends to gradually change toward the average

processes (PDMPs) on a bounded state space. The control problem under study is
very general: a pair of controls acts continuously on the deterministic flow
and on the two transition measures (in the interior and from the boundary of
the domain) describing the jump dynamics of the process. For this class of
control problems, the value function can be characterized as the unique
viscosity solution to the corresponding fully-nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation with a non-local type boundary condition. By means of the recent
control randomization method, we are able to provide a probabilistic
representation for the value function in terms of a constrained backward
stochastic differential equation (BSDE), known as nonlinear Feynman-Kac
formula. This result considerably extends the existing literature, where only
the case with no jumps from the boundary is considered. The additional boundary
jump mechanism is described in terms of a non quasi-left-continuous random
measure and induces predictable jumps in the PDMP's dynamics. The existence and

spectral application and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) owing to their
advantages in terms of compactness, higher trigger rates, offline analysis,
etc. Meanwhile, the noise of readout electronics is usually trivial for
organic, plastic, or liquid scintillator with PSD ability because of their poor
intrinsic energy resolution. However, LaBr3(Ce) has been widely used for its
excellent energy resolution and has been proven to have PSD ability for
alpha/gamma particles. Therefore, designing a digital acquisition system for
such scintillators as LaBr3(Ce) with both optimal energy resolution and
promising PSD ability is worthwhile. Several experimental research studies
about the choice of digitiser properties for liquid scintillators have already
been conducted in terms of the sampling rate and vertical resolution.
Quantitative analysis on the influence of waveform digitisers, that is, fast
amplifier (optional), sampling rates, and vertical resolution, on both
applications is still lacking. The present paper provides quantitative analysis
of these factors and, hence, general rules about the optimal design of
digitisers for both energy resolution and PSD application according to the
noise analysis of time-variant gated charge integration.

otherwise would have strong impact on the stellar evolution, can be neglected.
The observed differences are determined by the difference in stellar mass
between the two components. The mass ratio can be determined with much higher
accuracy than the actual stellar mass. In this work, we aim to study the
eccentric binary system KIC9163796, whose two components are very close in mass
and both are low-luminosity red-giant stars from four years of Kepler space
photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy with Hermes. Mass and radius of the
primary were determined through asteroseismology to be 1.39+/-0.06 Mo and
5.35+/-0.09 Ro, resp. From spectral disentangling the mass ratio was found to
be 1.015+/-0.005 and that the secondary is ~600K hotter than the primary.
Evolutionary models place both components, in the early and advanced stage of
the first dredge-up event on the red-giant branch. From theoretical models of
the primary, we derived the internal rotational gradient. From a grid of
models, the measured difference in lithium abundance is compared with
theoretical predictions. The surface rotation of the primary is determined from
the Kepler light curve and resembles the orbital period within 10 days. The
radial rotational gradient between the surface and core is found to be
6.9+2.0/-1.0. The agreement between the surface rotation with the seismic
result indicates that the full convective envelope is rotating quasi-rigidly.
The models of the lithium abundance are compatible with a rigid rotation in the
radiative zone during the main sequence. Because of the many constraints
offered by oscillating stars in binary systems, such objects are important test
beds of stellar evolution.

allows previously known Be stars to be detected and to find new Be candidates
which could be confirmed spectroscopically. The location of Be stars in the
WISE colour-magnitude diagram, separates them in two groups; active (Be stars
hosting a developed circumstellar disk) and quiescent objects (Be stars in a
diskless phase), and this way, we can explore how often stars are observed in
these different stages. The variability observed in most active variable Be
stars is compatible with a disk dissipation phase. We find that 50 percent of
Be stars in the studied open clusters are in an active phase. We can interpret
this as Be stars having a developed circumstellar disk half of the time. The
location of Be stars with a developed disk in the CMD require mass loss rates
in agreement with values recently reported in the literature. For these
objects, we expect to have a tight relation between the equivalent width of the
H{\alpha} line and the mass of the disk, if the inclination is known. Also,
near-infrared photometry of Be stars in stellar clusters has the potential of
being useful to test whether there is a preferential viewing angle.

study of complex molecular systems whose essential dynamics is characterized by
rare or slow transition events. In a recent publication, precise defining
characteristics of such reaction coordinates were identified and linked to the
existence of a so-called transition manifold. This theory gives rise to a novel
numerical method for the pointwise computation of reaction coordinates that
relies on short parallel MD simulations only, but yields accurate approximation
of the long time behavior of the system under consideration. This article
presents an extension of the method towards practical applicability in
computational chemistry. It links the newly defined reaction coordinates to
concepts from transition path theory and Markov state model building. The main
result is an alternative computational scheme that allows for a global
computation of reaction coordinates based on commonly available types of
simulation data, such as single long molecular trajectories, or the
push-forward of arbitrary canonically-distributed point clouds. It is based on
a Galerkin approximation of the transition manifold reaction coordinates, that
can be tuned to individual requirements by the choice of the Galerkin ansatz
functions. Moreover, we propose a ready-to-implement variant of the new scheme,
that computes data-fitted, mesh-free ansatz functions directly from the
available simulation data. The efficacy of the new method is demonstrated on a
small protein system.

Contrary to the naive expectation, we found that even if the superconducting

although the gap between the incipient bands and the Fermi level is much larger

the first images of a cold brown dwarf companion to the exoplanet host star
HD4113A. The brown dwarf HD4113C is part of a complex dynamical system
consisting of a giant planet, stellar host and a known wide M-dwarf companion.
Its separation of $535\pm3$mas and H-band contrast of $13.35\pm0.10$mag
correspond to a projected separation of 22AU and an isochronal mass estimate of
$36\pm5$M$_J$ based on COND models. The companion shows strong methane
absorption, and through atmospheric model fitting we estimate a surface gravity
of $\log g$=5 and an effective temperature of ~500-600K. A comparison of its
spectrum with observed T dwarfs indicates a late-T spectral type, with a T9
object providing the best match. By combining the observed astrometry from the
imaging data with 27 years of radial velocities, we use orbital fitting to
constrain its orbital and physical parameters, as well as update those of the
planet HD4113Ab, discovered by previous radial velocity measurements. The data
suggest a dynamical mass of $66\pm5$M$_J$ and moderate eccentricity of
$0.44\pm0.08$ for the brown dwarf. This mass estimate appears to conflict with
the isochronal estimate and that of similar objects, which may be caused by the
newly detected object being an unresolved binary brown dwarf system or the
presence of an additional object in the system. Through dynamical simulations
we show that the planet may undergo strong Lidov-Kozai cycles, raising the
possibility that it formed on a quasi-circular orbit and gained its currently
observed high eccentricity through interactions with the brown dwarf. Follow-up
observations combining radial velocities, direct imaging and Gaia astrometry
will be crucial to precisely constrain the dynamical mass of the brown dwarf
and allow for in-depth comparison with evolutionary and atmospheric models.

problems with fixed turnover times: a very natural model that has received
little attention in the literature. Nodes with capacity for storing a certain
commodity are located at various places; at each node the commodity depletes
within a certain time, the turnover time, which is constant but can vary
between locations. Nodes should never run empty, and to prevent this we may
schedule nodes for replenishment every day. The natural feature that makes this
problem interesting is that we may schedule a replenishment (well) before a
node becomes empty, but then the next replenishment will be due earlier also.
This added workload needs to be balanced against the cost of routing vehicles
to do the replenishments. In this paper, we focus on the aspect of minimizing
routing costs. However, the framework of recurring tasks, in which the next job
of a task must be done within a fixed amount of time after the previous one is
much more general and gives an adequate model for many practical situations.
  Note that our problem has an infinite time horizon. However, it can be fully
characterized by a compact input, containing only the location of each store
and a turnover time. This makes determining its computational complexity highly
challenging and indeed it remains essentially unresolved. We study the problem
for two objectives: min-avg minimizes the average tour length and min-max
minimizes the maximum tour length over all days. For min-max we derive a
logarithmic factor approximation for the problem on general metrics and a
6-approximation for the problem on trees, for which we have a proof of
NP-hardness. For min-avg we present a logarithmic approximation on general
metrics, 2-approximation for trees, and a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for
the line. Many intriguing problems remain open.

on bubble flows obtained by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Surfactants are
amphiphilic compounds which accumulate at fluid interfaces and significantly
modify the respective interfacial properties, influencing also the overall
dynamics of the flow. With the aid of DNS local quantities like the surfactant
distribution on the bubble surface can be accessed for a better understanding
of the physical phenomena occurring close to the interface. The core part of
the physical model consists in the description of the surfactant transport in
the bulk and on the deformable interface. The solution procedure is based on an
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking method. The existing
methodology was enhanced to describe a wider range of physical phenomena. A
subgrid-scale (SGS) model is employed in the cases where a fully resolved DNS
for the species transport is not feasible due to high mesh resolution
requirements and, therefore, high computational costs. After an exhaustive
validation of the latest numerical developments, the DNS of single rising

gain a better understanding of the local bubble dynamics under the effect of

are detrimental. A normal metal ($N$) in contact with a superconductor ($S$)
can trap these excitations; therefore such a trap can potentially improve the
devices performances. The two materials influence each other, a phenomenon
known as proximity effect which has drawn attention since the '60s. Here we
study whether this mutual influence places a limitation on the possible
performance improvement in superconducting qubits. We first revisit the
proximity effect in uniform $NS$ bilayers; despite the long history of this
problem, we present novel findings for the density of states. We then extend
our results to describe a non-uniform system in the vicinity of a trap edge.
Using these results together with a phenomenological model for the suppression
of the quasiparticle density due to the trap, we find in a transmon qubit an
optimum trap-junction distance at which the qubit relaxation rate is minimized.
This optimum distance, of the order of 4 to 20 coherence lengths, originates
from the competition between proximity effect and quasiparticle density
suppression. We conclude that the harmful influence of the proximity effect can
be avoided so long as the trap is farther away from the junction than this
optimum.

studied numerically in a random Gaussian environment modeled by stationary
Gaussian potentials with decaying spatial correlations. This anomalous
diffusion is archetypal for living cells, where cytoplasm is known to be
viscoelastic and a spatial disorder also naturally emerges. We obtain some
first important insights into it within a model one-dimensional study. Two
basic types of potential correlations are studied: short-range exponentially
decaying and algebraically slow decaying with an infinite correlation length,
both for a moderate (several $k_BT$, in the units of thermal energy), and
strong (5-10 $k_BT$) disorder. For a moderate disorder, it is shown that on the
ensemble level viscoelastic subdiffusion can easily overcome the medium's
disorder. Asymptotically, it is not distinguishable from the disorder-free
subdiffusion. However, a strong scatter in single-trajectory averages is
nevertheless seen even for a moderate disorder. It features a weak ergodicity
breaking, which occurs on a very long yet transient time scale. Furthermore,
for a strong disorder, a very long transient regime of logarithmic, Sinai-type
diffusion emerges. It can last longer and be faster in the absolute terms for
weakly decaying correlations as compare with the short-range correlations.
Residence time distributions in a finite spatial domain are of a generalized
log-normal type and are reminiscent also of a stretched exponential
distribution. They can be easily confused for power-law distributions in view
of the observed weak ergodicity breaking. This suggests a revision of some
experimental data and their interpretation.

  density distribution","9 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.CB physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Experimental measurements of bone mineral density distributions
(BMDDs) enable a determination of secondary mineralisation kinetics in bone,
but the maximum degree of mineralisation and how this maximum is approached
remain uncertain. We thus test computationally different hypotheses on late
stages of bone mineralisation by simulating BMDDs in low turnover conditions.
Materials and Methods: An established computational model of the BMDD that
accounts for mineralisation and remodelling processes was extended to limit
mineralisation to various maximum calcium capacities of bone. Simulated BMDDs
obtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD under
different assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with
experimental BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an
abrupt stopping of mineralisation near a maximum calcium capacity induces a
pile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed experimentally.
With a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium
capacities helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover
BMDDs with peak location and width of experimental BMDDs, but results in a
distinctive asymmetric peak shape. No tuning of turnover rate and maximum
calcium capacity was able to explain the differences found in experimental
BMDDs between trabecular bone (high turnover) and femoral cortical bone (low
turnover). Conclusions: Secondary mineralisation in human bone does not stop
abruptly, but continues slowly up to a calcium content greater than 30 wt% Ca.
The similar mineral heterogeneity seen in trabecular and femoral cortical bones
at different peak locations was unexplained by turnover differences tested.

effectiveness of the properties in RF is overlooked in the literature. In this
paper, we present a novel feature-augmented random forest (FARF) for image
super-resolution, where the conventional gradient-based features are augmented
with gradient magnitudes and different feature recipes are formulated on
different stages in an RF. The advantages of our method are that, firstly, the
dictionary-learning-based features are enhanced by adding gradient magnitudes,
based on the observation that the non-linear gradient magnitude are with highly
discriminative property. Secondly, generalized locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)
is used to replace principal component analysis (PCA) for feature
dimensionality reduction and original high-dimensional features are employed,
instead of the compressed ones, for the leaf-nodes' regressors, since
regressors can benefit from higher dimensional features. This
original-compressed coupled feature sets scheme unifies the unsupervised LSH
evaluation on both image super-resolution and content-based image retrieval
(CBIR). Finally, we present a generalized weighted ridge regression (GWRR)
model for the leaf-nodes' regressors. Experiment results on several public
benchmark datasets show that our FARF method can achieve an average gain of
about 0.3 dB, compared to traditional RF-based methods. Furthermore, a
fine-tuned FARF model can compare to or (in many cases) outperform some recent
stateof-the-art deep-learning-based algorithms.

spontaneously as the result of a family of stochastic optimization processes

encoding of a maturational schedule. In particular, we present simulated
experiments with an arm where a computational learner progressively acquires
reaching skills through adaptive exploration, and we show that a proximodistal
organization appears spontaneously, which we denote PDFF (ProximoDistal
Freezing and Freeing of degrees of freedom). We also compare this emergent
organization between different arm morphologies -- from human-like to quite
unnatural ones -- to study the effect of different kinematic structures on the

linked to the solar cycle. The important large scale flows are the differential
rotation and the meridional circulation with an amplitude of km/s and few m/s ,
respectively. These flows also have a cycle related components, namely the
torsional oscillations. Our attempt is to determine large-scale plasma flows on
the solar surface by deriving horizontal flow velocities using the techniques
of solar granule tracking, dopplergrams, and time distance helioseismology.
Coherent structure tracking (CST) and time distance helioseismology were used
to investigate the solar differential rotation and meridional circulation at
the solar surface on a 30 day HMI SDO sequence. The influence of a large
sunspot on these large scale flows with a specific 7 day HMI SDO sequence has
been also studied. The large scale flows measured by the CST on the solar
surface and the same flow determined from the same data with the
helioseismology in the first 1 Mm below the surface are in good agreement in
amplitude and direction. The torsional waves are also located at the same
latitudes with amplitude of the same order. We are able to measure the
meridional circulation correctly using the CST method with only three days of
data and after averaging between + and -15 degrees in longitude. We conclude
that the combination of CST and Doppler velocities allows us to detect properly
the differential solar rotation and also smaller amplitude flows such as the
meridional circulation and torsional waves. The results of our methods are in
good agreement with helioseismic measurements.

real positive coupling constant $K: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ by the
action $\mathcal{S}[h] = \frac{1}{8\pi } \int_\Omega \frac{\sqrt{{\rm g}} d^2

correlations functions of the IGFF are expressible in terms of the Green's
functions of generalized Poisson operators that are familiar from 2d
electrostatics in media with spatially varying dielectric constants.
  This formalism is then applied to the study of ground state correlations of
the Lieb-Liniger gas trapped in an external potential $V(x)$. Relations with
previous works on inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids are discussed. The main
innovation here is in the identification of local observables $\hat{O} (x)$ in
the microscopic model with their field theory counterparts $\partial_x h, e^{i
h(x)}, e^{-i h(x)}$, etc., which involve non-universal coefficients that
themselves depend on position --- a fact that, to the best of our knowledge,
was overlooked in previous works on correlation functions of inhomogeneous
Luttinger liquids ---, and that can be calculated thanks to Bethe Ansatz form
factors formulae available for the homogeneous Lieb-Liniger model. Combining
those position-dependent coefficients with the correlation functions of the
IGFF, ground state correlation functions of the trapped gas are obtained.

driven by an attraction parameter $\varepsilon$, and the other is the
loop-stretch transition in a chain with one end attached to a repulsive
substrate, driven by an external end-force $F$ applied to the free end.
Specifically, we compare the behavior of the respective order parameters of the
transitions, i.e., the mean number of surface contacts in the case of the
adsorption transition, and the mean position of the chain end in the case of
the loop-stretch transition. Close to the transition points, both the static

of the adsorption transition, and $\nu$ the Flory exponent. We show that both
the loop-stretch and the loop adsorption transitions provide an exceptional
opportunity to construct explicit analytical expressions for the crossover
functions which perfectly describe all simulation results on static properties
in the finite-size scaling regime. Explicit crossover functions are based on
the Ansatz for the analytical form of the order parameter distributions at the
respective transition points. In contrast to the close similarity in
equilibrium static behavior, the dynamic relaxation at the two transitions
shows qualitative differences, especially in the strongly ordered regimes.

this evaluation. One is a dataset of many different scene types with
groundtruth 3D points, containing images of different scenes captured at fixed
positions, for quantitative performance evaluation of different local features
in the controlled image capturing situations. The other dataset contains
Internet scale image sets of several landmarks with a lot of unrelated images,
which is used for qualitative performance evaluation of different local

that binary features are competent to reconstruct scenes from controlled image
sequences with only a fraction of processing time compared to use float type

an $e$-folding time $\approx 8116$d ($\approx 22.2$ yr). For the theoretical
understanding of the observations, we examined three variability models
proposed in the literature: the thermal-viscous disc instability model, the
radiation pressure instability model, and the tidal disruption event (TDE)

size and considers scaling results for large networks. We connect two
performance measures that are well studied, but appear to be unrelated. The
first measure is concerned with energy metrics, namely the $\Hcal_2$--norm of a
network, which arises in control theory applications. The second measure is
concerned with the notion of ""tail risk"" which arises in economic and financial
networks. We study the question of why such performance measures may
deteriorate at a faster rate than the growth rate of the network. We first
focus on the energy metric and its well known connection to controllability
Gramian of the underlying dynamical system. We show that undirected networks
exhibit the most graceful energy growth rates as network size grows. This rate
is quantified completely by the proximity of spectral radius to unity or
distance to instability. In contrast, we show that the simple characterization
of energy in terms of network spectrum does not exist for directed networks. We
demonstrate that, for any fixed distance to instability, energy of a directed
network can grow at an exponentially faster rate. We provide general methods
for manipulating networks to reduce energy. In particular, we prove that
certain operations that increase the symmetry in a network cannot increase
energy (in an order sense). Secondly, we focus on tail risk in economic and
financial networks. In contrast to $\Hcal_2$--norm which arises from computing
the expectation of energy in the network, tail risk focuses on tail probability
behavior of network variables. Although the two measures differ substantially
we show that they are precisely connected through the system Gramian. This
surprising result explains why topology considerations rather than specific
performance measures dictate the large scale behavior of networks.

implementation strategies to obtain a controller with certain performance
guarantees. This class includes two existing implementation strategies from the
literature, based on discounted payoff and mean-payoff games. We unify both
approaches by using games characterized by a single discount factor determining
the implementation. We evaluate different implementations from our class
experimentally on two case studies. We show that the choice of the discount
factor has a significant influence on the average long-term costs, and the best
performance guarantee for the symbolic model does not result in the best
implementation. Comparing the optimal choice of the discount factor here with
the previously proposed values, the costs differ by a factor of up to 50. Our
approach therefore yields a method to choose systematically a good

standard file formats with parsers implemented in many programming languages).
We have implemented the format for the Standard Model EFT (SMEFT) and for the

Karman-Howarth equation by asymptotic expansion of the second- and third- order
structure functions in powers of the inverse Reynolds number. The implications
of the time-derivative term for the assumption of local stationarity (or local
equilibrium) which underpins the derivation of the Kolmogorov `4/5' law for the
third-order structure function were studied. It was concluded that neglect of
the time-derivative cannot be justified by reason of restriction to certain
scales (the inertial range) nor to large Reynolds numbers. In principle,
therefore, the hypothesis cannot be correct, although it may be a good
approximation. It follows, at least in principle, that the quantitative aspects
of the hypothesis of local stationarity could be tested by a comparison of the
asymptotic dimensionless dissipation rate for free decay with that for the
stationary case. But in practice this is complicated by the absence of an
agreed evolution time for making the measurements during the decay. However, we
can assess the quantitative error involved in using the hypothesis by comparing
the exact asymptotic value of the dimensionless dissipation in free decay
calculated on the assumption of local stationarity to the experimentally
determined value (e.g. by means of direct numerical simulation), as this
relationship holds for all measuring times. Should the assumption of local
stationarity lead to significant error, then the `4/5' law needs to be
corrected. Despite this, scale invariance in wavenumber space appears to hold
in the formal limit of infinite Reynolds numbers, which implies that the `-5/3'
energy spectrum does not require correction in this limit.

and 21 cm signals during the epoch of reionisation (EoR) to measure the effects
of patchy reionisation. Since the kSZ effect is proportional to the
line-of-sight velocity, the kSZ-21 cm cross correlation suffers from
cancellation at small angular scales. We thus focus on the correlation between
the kSZ-squared field (kSZ$^2$) and 21 cm signals. When the global ionisation
fraction is low ($x_e\lesssim 0.7$), the kSZ$^2$ fluctuation is dominated by
rare ionised bubbles which leads to an anti-correlation with the 21 cm signal.
When $0.8\lesssim x_e<1$, the correlation is dominated by small pockets of
neutral regions, leading to a positive correlation. However, at very high
redshifts when $x_e<0.15$, the spin temperature fluctuations change the sign of
the correlation from negative to positive, as weakly ionised regions can have
strong 21 cm signals in this case. To extract this correlation, we find that
Wiener filtering is effective in removing large signals from the primary CMB
anisotropy. The expected signal-to-noise ratios for a $\sim$10-hour integration

given document with respect to a given aspect entity. While neural network
architectures have been successful in predicting the overall polarity of
sentences, aspect-specific sentiment analysis still remains as an open problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel method for integrating aspect information
into the neural model. More specifically, we incorporate aspect information
into the neural model by modeling word-aspect relationships. Our novel model,
\textit{Aspect Fusion LSTM} (AF-LSTM) learns to attend based on associative
relationships between sentence words and aspect which allows our model to
adaptively focus on the correct words given an aspect term. This ameliorates
the flaws of other state-of-the-art models that utilize naive concatenations to
model word-aspect similarity. Instead, our model adopts circular convolution
and circular correlation to model the similarity between aspect and words and
elegantly incorporates this within a differentiable neural attention framework.
Finally, our model is end-to-end differentiable and highly related to
convolution-correlation (holographic like) memories. Our proposed neural model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming
ATAE-LSTM by $4\%-5\%$ on average across multiple datasets.

powerful tools for the characterization of complex networks. The intricate
topology of networks can also be investigated by means of the collective
dynamics observed in the interactions of self-sustained oscillations
(synchronization patterns) or propagation-like processes such as random walks.
However, networks are often inferred from real data forming dynamic systems,
which are different from those employed to reveal their topological
characteristics. This stresses the necessity for a theoretical framework
dedicated to the mutual relationship between the structure and dynamics in
complex networks, as the two sides of the same coin. Here we propose a rigorous
framework based on the network response over time (i.e., Green function) to
study interactions between nodes across time. For this purpose we define the
\emph{flow} that describes the interplay between the network connectivity and
external inputs. This multivariate measure relates to the concepts of graph
communicability and the map equation. We illustrate our theory using the
multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which describes stable and
non-conservative dynamics, but the formalism can be adapted to other local
dynamics for which the Green function is known. We provide applications to
classical network examples, such as small-world ring and hierarchical networks.
Our theory defines a comprehensive framework that is canonically related to
directed and weighted networks, thus paving a new way to revise the standards
for network analysis, from the pairwise interactions between nodes to the
global properties of networks including community detection.

energy-momentum tensor. We consider the functional form $f(R,T)=f(R)+f(T)$,
with $f(R)$ being the Starobinksy model, named $R+\alpha R^{2}$, and
$f(T)=2\gamma T$, with $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ being constants. We show that a
hybrid expansion law form for the scale factor is a solution for the derived
Friedmann-like equations. In this way, the model is able to predict both the
decelerated and the accelerated regimes of expansion of the universe, with the
transition redshift between these stages being in accordance with recent
observations. We also apply the energy conditions to our material content
solutions. Such an application makes us able to obtain the range of
acceptability for the free parameters of the model, named $\alpha$ and
$\gamma$.

superconducting state is a second-order phase transition in the BCS-Bogoliubov
model of superconductivity from the viewpoint of operator theory. Here we have
no magnetic field. Moreover we obtain the exact and explicit expression for the
gap in the specific heat at constant volume at the transition temperature. To
this end, we have to differentiate the thermodynamic potential with respect to
the temperature two times. Since there is the solution to the BCS-Bogoliubov
gap equation in the form of the thermodynamic potential, we have to
differentiate the solution with respect to the temperature two times.
Therefore, we need to show that the solution to the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation
is differentiable with respect to the temperature two times as well as its
existence and uniqueness. We carry out its proof on the basis of fixed point
theorems.

  Data",,,"10.1145/3167132.3167226",,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification approach is conceptually simple -
yet widely applied since it often performs well in practical applications.
However, using a global constant k does not always provide an optimal solution,
e.g., for datasets with an irregular density distribution of data points. This
paper proposes an adaptive kNN classifier where k is chosen dynamically for
each instance (point) to be classified, such that the expected accuracy of
classification is maximized. We define the expected accuracy as the accuracy of
a set of structurally similar observations. An arbitrary similarity function
can be used to find these observations. We introduce and evaluate different
similarity functions. For the evaluation, we use five different classification
tasks based on geo-spatial data. Each classification task consists of (tens of)
thousands of items. We demonstrate, that the presented expected accuracy
measures can be a good estimator for kNN performance, and the proposed adaptive
kNN classifier outperforms common kNN and previously introduced adaptive kNN
algorithms. Also, we show that the range of considered k can be significantly
reduced to speed up the algorithm without negative influence on classification
accuracy.

conditions, we mean the first and last row of the matrix. For large $n$, we
show there are up to $4$ eigenvalues, the so-called \emph{special eigenvalues},
whose behavior depends sensitively on the boundary conditions. The other
eigenvalues, the so-called \emph{regular eigenvalues} vary very little as
function of the boundary conditions. For large $n$, we determine the regular
eigenvalues up to ${\cal O}(n^{-2})$, and the special eigenvalues up to ${\cal
O}(\kappa^n)$, for some $\kappa\in (0,1)$. The components of the eigenvectors
are determined up to ${\cal O}(n^{-1})$.
  The matrices we study have important applications throughout the sciences.
Among the most common ones are arrays of linear dynamical systems with nearest
neighbor coupling, and discretizations of second order linear partial
differential equations. In both cases, we give examples where specific choices
of boundary conditions substantially influence leading eigenvalues, and
therefore the global dynamics of the system.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1512.07349","Social Network Analysis and Mining, 2018",,,"cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The smallest eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors (i.e., eigenpairs)
of a graph Laplacian matrix have been widely used in spectral clustering and
community detection. However, in real-life applications the number of clusters
or communities (say, $K$) is generally unknown a-priori. Consequently, the
majority of the existing methods either choose $K$ heuristically or they repeat
the clustering method with different choices of $K$ and accept the best
clustering result. The first option, more often, yields suboptimal result,
while the second option is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose
an incremental method for constructing the eigenspectrum of the graph Laplacian
matrix. This method leverages the eigenstructure of graph Laplacian matrix to
obtain the $K$-th smallest eigenpair of the Laplacian matrix given a collection
of all previously computed $K-1$ smallest eigenpairs. Our proposed method
adapts the Laplacian matrix such that the batch eigenvalue decomposition
problem transforms into an efficient sequential leading eigenpair computation
problem. As a practical application, we consider user-guided spectral
clustering. Specifically, we demonstrate that users can utilize the proposed
incremental method for effective eigenpair computation and for determining the
desired number of clusters based on multiple clustering metrics.
