Transportation System (ITS). They are expected to provide ubiquitous network
connectivity to moving vehicles while supporting various ITS services, some
with very stringent requirements in terms of latency and reliability. Two
vehicular networking technologies are envisioned to jointly support the full
range of ITS services : DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) for direct
vehicle to vehicle/Road Side Units (RSU) communications and cellular
technologies. To the best of our knowledge, approaches from the literature
usually divide ITS services on each of these networks according to their
requirements and one single network is in charge of supporting the each
service. Those that consider both network technologies to offer multi-path
routing, load balancing or path splitting for a better quality of experience of
ITS services assume obviously separately controlled networks. Under the
umbrella of SDN (Software Defined Networking), we propose in this paper a
hybrid network architecture that enables the joint control of the networks
providing connectivity to multi-homed vehicles and, also, explore the
opportunities brought by such an architecture. We show through some use cases,
that in addition to the flexibility and fine-grained programmability brought by
SDN, it opens the way towards the development of effective network control
algorithms that are the key towards the successful support of ITS services and
especially those with stringent QoS. We also show how these algorithms could
also benefit from information related to the environment or context in which
vehicles evolve (traffic density, planned trajectory, ..), which could be
easily collected by data providers and made available via the cloud.

most stable surface adsorbates are Ba-O species with compositions in the range
of Ba0.125O to Ba0.25O per surface W atom, with O passivating all dangling W

alters the surface energetics and changes the proportions of surface facets

theory predicts for the D-term D = -1. (ii) Even infinitesimally small
interactions can drastically impact D. (iii) In strongly interacting theories
one can encounter large negative D though notable exceptions exist, which
includes Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking. (iv) Contrary to common
belief one cannot arbitrarily add ""total derivatives"" to the EMT. Rather the
EMT must be defined in an unambiguous way.
  The second part deals with the interpretation of EMT form factors in terms of
3D-densities with following results. (i) The 3D-density formalism is internally
consistent. (ii) The description is subject to relativistic corrections which
are acceptably small in phenomenologically relevant situations including
nucleon and nuclei. (iii) The free field result D=-1 persists when a spin-0
boson is not point-like but ""heuristically given some internal structure.""

structure"" can be implemented dynamically, and has the following insights. (i)
We construct a consistent microscopic theory which, in a certain parametric
limit, interpolates between extended and point-like solutions. (ii) This theory
is exactly solvable which is rare in 3+1 dimensions, admits non-topological
solitons of Q-ball-type, and has a Gaussian field amplitude. (iii) The
interaction of this theory belongs to a class of logarithmic potentials which
were discussed in literature, albeit in different contexts including beyond
standard model phenomenology, cosmology, and Higgs physics.

the D-term of a spin-1/2 fermion is of dynamical origin: it vanishes for a free

free spin-0 boson has a non-zero intrinsic D-term as shown in an accompanying
work. We illustrate in two simple models how interactions generate the D-term
of a fermion with an internal structure, the nucleon. All known matter is

red (quiescent) galaxies, whether in groups or isolated, increases with both
stellar mass and large-scale (5 Mpc) density. At fixed stellar mass, the red
fraction is on average higher for satellites of red centrals than of blue
(star-forming) centrals, a galactic conformity effect that increases with
density. Most of the signal originates from groups that have the highest
stellar mass, reside in the densest environments, and have massive, red only
centrals. Assuming a color-dependent halo-to-stellar-mass ratio, whereby red
central galaxies inhabit significantly more massive halos than blue ones of the
same stellar mass, two regimes emerge more distinctly: at log(Mhalo/Msol) < 13,
central quenching is still ongoing, conformity is no longer existent, and
satellites and group centrals exhibit the same quenching excess over field
galaxies at all mass and density, in agreement with the concept of ""group
quenching""; at log(Mhalo/Msol) > 13, a cutoff that sets apart massive
(log(M*/Msol) > 11), fully quenched group centrals, conformity is meaningless,
and satellites undergo significantly more quenching than their counterparts in
smaller halos. The latter effect strongly increases with density, giving rise
to the density-dependent conformity signal when both regimes are mixed. The
star-formation of blue satellites in massive halos is also suppressed compared
to blue field galaxies, while blue group centrals and the majority of blue
satellites, which reside in low mass halos, show no deviation from the
color-stellar mass relation of blue field galaxies.

difficulties inherent to infant brain MRI, e.g., the isointense contrast

brain sizes. This study investigates the problem with an ensemble of semi-dense
fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which employs T1-weighted and
T2-weighted MR images as input. We demonstrate that the ensemble agreement is
highly correlated with the segmentation errors. Therefore, our method provides
measures that can guide local user corrections. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first ensemble of 3D CNNs for suggesting annotations within

layers directly to the end of the network. Our architecture allows the
efficient propagation of gradients during training, while limiting the number
of parameters, requiring one order of magnitude less parameters than popular

repulsive, dispersive and electrostatic forces. It is supposed that H-bond is
of electrostatic nature (the irreducible contribution caused by overlapping of
electronic shells is unessential). The dispersive interaction is approximated
with London's formula, the electrostatic interaction is modelled by a multipole
expansion up to dipole-octupole contribution. The multipole moments are assumed
to be equal to their experimental values or to quantum chemical calculations.
The repulsion is modelled by power potential, whose parameters are fitted to
the second virial coefficient and to the parameters of dimers. Along with the
bare potential, the averaged potential of interparticle interaction is
analyzed. It is shown that the repulsive potential has an exponent $n=28$. The

be similar to the formation of rocky planets in a proto-planetary disc,
especially Super-Earths. Thus, it is possible to use systems with large
satellites to test formation theories that are also applicable to extrasolar
planets. Furthermore, a better understanding of the origin of satellites might
yield important information about the environment near the growing planet
during the last stages of planet formation. In this work we investigate the
formation and migration of the Jovian satellites through N-body simulations. We
simulated a massive, static, low viscosity, circum-planetary disc in agreement
with the minimum mass sub-nebula model prescriptions for its total mass. In
hydrodynamic simulations we found no signs of gaps, therefore type II migration
is not expected. Hence, we used analytic prescriptions for type I migration,
eccentricity and inclination damping, and performed N-body simulations with
damping forces added. Detailed parameter studies showed that the number of
final satellites is strong influenced by the initial distribution of embryos,
the disc temperature, and the initial gas density profile. For steeper initial
density profiles it is possible to form systems with multiple satellites in
resonance while a flatter profile favours the formation of satellites close to
the region of the Galilean satellites. We show that the formation of massive
satellites such as Ganymede and Callisto can be achieved for hotter discs with
an aspect ratio of H/r ~ 0.15 for which the ice line was located around 30 R_J.

Nonreciprocity is then obtained using a distributed source that replaces the
non-standard boundary condition where the normal velocity at the boundary is a
function of both pressure and its tangential derivative. Numerical simulations
are carried out to validate the theoretical model, and the scattering matrix of
the device is retrieved to investigate the nonreciprocal nature of the system.
Results show that the proposed device can lead to an efficient,
ultra-broadband, sub-wavelength, acoustic isolator. Finally, the effects of
actual, finite-sized transducers on the performance of the acoustic isolator

to understand SNRs as a whole, large samples of SNRs must be assembled and

been used to identify and characterize almost 300 Galactic SNRs and more than
1200 extragalactic SNRs. We then discuss which types of SNRs are being found

broadband traffic (eMBB) and ultra-low-latency communications (URLLC) traffic.
In these systems, time is divided into slots which are further sub-divided into
minislots. From a scheduling perspective, eMBB resource allocations occur at
slot boundaries, whereas to reduce latency URLLC traffic is pre-emptively
overlapped at the minislot timescale, resulting in selective
superposition/puncturing of eMBB allocations. This approach enables minimal
URLLC latency at a potential rate loss to eMBB traffic.
  We study joint eMBB and URLLC schedulers for such systems, with the dual
objectives of maximizing utility for eMBB traffic while immediately satisfying
URLLC demands. For a linear rate loss model (loss to eMBB is linear in the
amount of URLLC superposition/puncturing), we derive an optimal joint
scheduler. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results show that our dual
objectives can be met by an iterative gradient scheduler for eMBB traffic that
anticipates the expected loss from URLLC traffic, along with an URLLC demand
scheduler that is oblivious to eMBB channel states, utility functions and
allocation decisions of the eMBB scheduler. Next we consider a more general
class of (convex/threshold) loss models and study optimal online joint
eMBB/URLLC schedulers within the broad class of channel state dependent but
minislot-homogeneous policies. A key observation is that unlike the linear rate
loss model, for the convex and threshold rate loss models, optimal eMBB and
URLLC scheduling decisions do not de-couple and joint optimization is necessary
to satisfy the dual objectives. We validate the characteristics and benefits of
our schedulers via simulation.

$b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$. The number of signal events originating from SM
di-Higgs production in each final state is small and for this reason
measurement of differential distributions may not be possible. Furthermore, we
consider various physics beyond the standard model scenarios to quantify the
effects of contamination while trying to measure the SM di-Higgs signals in
detail. In particular, we study generic resonant heavy Higgs decays to a pair
of SM-like Higgs bosons or to a pair of top quarks, heavy pseudoscalar decaying
to an SM-like Higgs and a $Z$-boson, charged Higgs production in association
with a top and a bottom quark and also various well-motivated supersymmetric
channels. We set limits on the cross-sections for the aforementioned new
physics scenarios, above which these can be seen as excesses over the SM
background and affect the measurement of Higgs quartic coupling. We also
discuss the correlations among various channels which can be useful to identify
the new physics model.

Standard Model (SM) which can address the origin of parity violation in the SM

reported DAMPE results of cosmic $e^+e^-$ spectrum which exhibits a tentative
peak around 1.4 TeV, while satisfying the current neutrino data. We propose to
explain the DAMPE peak with a complex scalar DM $\chi$ in two scenarios: 1)
$\chi\chi^* \to H_1^{++}H_1^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$; 2)
$\chi\chi^* \to H_{k}^{++}H_{k}^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$

\nu_{\ell_j}$ with $\ell_{i,j}=e,\mu,\tau$ and $k=1,2$. We fit the theoretical
prediction on $e^+e^-$ spectrum to relevant experimental data to determine the
scalar mass spectrum favored by the DAMPE excess. We also consider various
constraints from theoretical principles, collider experiments as well as DM
relic density and direct search experiments. We find that there are ample
parameter space which can interpret the DAMPE data while passing the

of other new physics at the energy scale ranging from $10^7 {\rm GeV}$ to

extinction-independent measure of the contribution by stellar populations older
than 9 Gyr to the mean r-band surface brightness of the bulge component in 135
late-type galaxies (LTGs) from the CALIFA survey, spanning a range of 2.6 dex
and 3 dex in total and bulge stellar mass (M*T~10^(8.9-11.5) M_solar and
M*B~10^(8.3-11.3) M_solar, respectively). The main insight from this study is
that LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing
M*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and
metallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and
vice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity
contrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising
from, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across
the mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass
bulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and
Seyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,
high-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves
and in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that
these components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a
continuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics. Our results are
consistent with a picture where bulge growth in LTGs is driven by a
superposition of quick-early and slow-secular processes, the relative
importance of which increases with M*T. These processes, which presumably
combine in situ SF in the bulge and inward migration of material from the disk,
are expected to lead to a non-homologous radial growth of S* and a trend for an
increasing Sersic index with increasing galaxy mass.

of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and can be a fascinating remnant of a
Grand Unified Theory (GUT). Recently, $Z'$ models with non-universal couplings
to the SM fermions due to extra vector-like states have received attention as
potential explanations of the present $R_K$, $R_{K^{\ast}}$ anomalies; this
includes GUT model proposals based on the $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ group. In this
paper we further develop GUT models with a flavour non-universal low scale $Z'$
and clarify several outstanding issues within them. First, we successfully
incorporate a realistic neutrino sector (with linear and/or inverse low scale
seesaw mechanism), which was so far a missing ingredient. Second, we
investigate in detail their compatibility with the $R_K$, $R_{K^{\ast}}$
anomalies; we find that the anomalies do not have a consistent explanation
within such models. Third, we demonstrate that these models have other
compelling phenomenological features; we study the correlations between the
flavour violating processes of $\mu\to 3e$ and $\mu$-$e$ conversion in a muonic
atom, showing how a GUT imprint could manifest itself in experiments.

out to be larger compared to a weak contribution of Sauter type. For higher
orders, specifically, for the rectangular barrier limit, i.e. $N \rightarrow

mentioned backgrounds significantly differ in Minkowski spacetime, we show that
the found coincidence applies due to identical reflection points in the
Euclidean instanton plane. In addition, we also treat the background in
perturbation theory following recent ideas. By doing so, we show that the
parameter $N$ determines whether the weak contribution behaves perturbatively
or nonperturbatively with respect to the field strength ratio and, hence,
reveals an interesting dependence on the background shape. In particular, we
show that for backgrounds, for which higher orders in the field strength ratio
turn out to be relevant, a proposed integral condition is not fulfilled. In
view of these findings, the latter may serve as an indicator for the necessity

basis-independent objects which are of more relevance. We employ one of these
invariants to give a new parametrization of the mass matrices. By virtue of it,
one gains control over its implicit implications on several mass matrix
structures. The key element is the trace invariant which resembles the equation
of a hypersphere with a radius equal to the Frobenius norm of the mass matrix.
With the concepts of alignment or misalignment we can identify texture zeros
with certain alignments whereas Froggatt-Nielsen structures in the matrix
elements are governed by misalignment. This method allows further insights of
traditional approaches to the underlying flavour geometry.

of their gamma-ray emission properties being suggestive of pulsar
magnetospheric emission. The new gamma-ray pulsars have pulse profiles and
spectral properties similar to those of previously-detected young gamma-ray

two of the newly-discovered pulsars, and enabled us to derive upper limits on
the radio emission from the others, demonstrating that they are likely
radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. We also present results from modeling the
gamma-ray pulse profiles and radio profiles, if available, using different

nanostructured systems, we propose the model of a peristaltic quantum pump.
Differently from the Thouless paradigm, a peristaltic pump is a quantum device
that generates a particle flux as the effect of a sliding finite-size
microlattice. A one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian model of this quantum
machine is formulated and analyzed within a lattice Green's function formalism
on the Keldysh contour. The pump observables, as e.g. the pumped particles per
cycle, are studied as a function of the pumping frequency, the width of the
pumping potential, the particles mean free path and system temperature. The
proposed analysis applies to arbitrary peristaltic potentials acting on
fermionic quantum fluids confined to one dimension. These confinement
conditions can be realized in nanostructured systems or, in a more controllable
way, in cold atoms experiments. In view of the validation of the theoretical
results, we describe the outcomes of the model considering a fermionic cold
atoms system as a paradigmatic example.

massless Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions ($d=2$) within the framework
of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, by considering the competing order parameters
that give rise to fully gapped (insulating or superconducting) ground states.
We focus only on those competing orders, which can be rotated into each other
by generators of an exact or emergent chiral symmetry of massless Dirac
fermions, and break $O(S_1)$ and $O(S_2)$ symmetries in the ordered phase.
Performing a renormalization group analysis by using the $\epsilon=(3-d)$
expansion scheme, we show that all the coupling constants in the critical
hyperplane flow toward a new attractive fixed point, supporting an
\emph{enlarged} $O(S_1+S_2)$ chiral symmetry. Such a fixed point acts as an
exotic quantum multi-critical point (MCP), governing the \emph{continuous}
semimetal-insulator as well as insulator-insulator (for example antiferromagnet
to valence bond solid) quantum phase transitions. In comparison with the lower
symmetric semimetal-insulator quantum critical points, possessing either
$O(S_1)$ or $O(S_2)$ chiral symmetry, the MCP displays enhanced correlation
length exponents, and anomalous scaling dimensions for both fermionic and
bosonic fields. We discuss the scaling properties of the ratio of bosonic and
fermionic masses, and the increased dc resistivity at the MCP. By computing the
scaling dimensions of different local fermion bilinears in the particle-hole
channel, we establish that most of the four fermion operators or generalized
density-density correlation functions display faster power law decays at the
MCP compared to the free fermion and lower symmetric itinerant quantum critical
points. Possible generalization of this scenario to higher dimensional Dirac
fermions is also outlined.

the 2-9 keV band, offers an unprecedented benchmark of the atomic modeling and
database for hot collisional plasmas. It reveals both successes and challenges
of the current atomic codes. The latest versions of AtomDB/APEC (3.0.8), SPEX
(3.03.00), and CHIANTI (8.0) all provide reasonable fits to the broad-band
spectrum, and are in close agreement on best-fit temperature, emission measure,
and abundances of a few elements such as Ni. For the Fe abundance, the APEC and
SPEX measurements differ by 16%, which is 17 times higher than the statistical
uncertainty. This is mostly attributed to the differences in adopted
collisional excitation and dielectronic recombination rates of the strongest
emission lines. We further investigate and compare the sensitivity of the
derived physical parameters to the astrophysical source modeling and
instrumental effects. The Hitomi results show that an accurate atomic code is
as important as the astrophysical modeling and instrumental calibration
aspects. Substantial updates of atomic databases and targeted laboratory
measurements are needed to get the current codes ready for the data from the
next Hitomi-level mission.

intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) have not been
found yet. Especially when the presence of IMBHs is constrained through
dynamical modeling of stellar kinematics, it is fundamental to account for the
displacement that the IMBH might have with respect to the GC centre. In this
paper we analyse the IMBH wandering around the stellar density centre using a
set of realistic direct N-body simulations of star cluster evolution. Guided by
the simulation results, we develop a basic yet accurate model that can be used
to estimate the average IMBH radial displacement ($\left<r_\mathrm{bh}\right>$)
in terms of structural quantities as the core radius ($r_\mathrm{c}$), mass
($M_\mathrm{c}$), and velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\mathrm{c}$), in addition to
the average stellar mass ($m_\mathrm{c}$) and the IMBH mass ($M_\mathrm{bh}$).
The model can be expressed by the equation
$\left<r_\mathrm{bh}\right>/r_\mathrm{c}=A(m_\mathrm{c}/M_\mathrm{bh})^\alpha[\sigma_\mathrm{c}^2r_\mathrm{c}/(GM_\mathrm{c})]^\beta$,
in which the free parameters $A,\alpha,\beta$ are calculated through comparison
with the numerical results on the IMBH displacement. The model is then applied
to Galactic GCs, finding that for an IMBH mass equal to 0.1% of the GC mass,
the typical expected displacement of a putative IMBH is around $1''$ for most
Galactic GCs, but IMBHs can wander to larger angular distances in some objects,
including a prediction of a $2.5''$ displacement for NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen),

ordinary components decrease as $\Delta m^2/E_{\nu}$. Therefore, the DE-induced

Spatially resolved kinematics of nearby early-type galaxies suggest that
allowing for a variable initial mass function (IMF) returns significantly
larger $\Upsilon_*$ gradients than if the IMF is held fixed. If $\Upsilon_*$ is
greater in the central regions, then ignoring the IMF-driven gradient can
overestimate $M_*^{\rm dyn}$ by as much as a factor of two for the most massive
galaxies, though stellar population estimates $M_*^{\rm SP}$ are also affected.
Large $\Upsilon_*$-gradients have four main consequences: First, $M_*^{\rm
dyn}$ cannot be estimated independently of stellar population synthesis models.
Second, if there is a lower limit to $\Upsilon_*$ and gradients are unknown,
then requiring $M_*^{\rm dyn}=M_*^{\rm SP}$ constrains them. Third, if
gradients are stronger in more massive galaxies, then $M_*^{\rm dyn}$ and
$M_*^{\rm SP}$ can be brought into agreement, not by shifting $M_*^{\rm SP}$
upwards by invoking constant bottom-heavy IMFs, as advocated by a number of
recent studies, but by revising $M_*^{\rm dyn}$ estimates in the literature
downwards. Fourth, accounting for $\Upsilon_*$ gradients changes the high-mass
slope of the stellar mass function $\phi(M_*^{\rm dyn})$, and reduces the
associated stellar mass density. These conclusions potentially impact estimates
of the need for feedback and adiabatic contraction, so our results highlight
the importance of measuring $\Upsilon_*$ gradients in larger samples.

in Minkowski's spacetime is always larger than its radius when at rest; (ii) in
Minkowski's spacetime, equilibria are linearly stable for rotation speeds below

linearly unstable for some rotation speeds above it; (iii) equilibria are
always linearly unstable in Schwarzschild's spacetime. Moreover, we study
interactions of a rotating string loop with a Kerr black hole, namely in the
context of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and the Penrose process. We
find that: (i) elastic string loops that satisfy the null energy condition
cannot overspin extremal black holes; (ii) elastic string loops that satisfy
the dominant energy condition cannot increase the maximum efficiency of the
usual particle Penrose process; (iii) if the dominant energy condition (but not

holes and the environments in which they reside. Being emitted from the
inner-most regions of the accretion disk, this X-ray spectral component carries
with it information not only about the plasma that resides in these extreme
conditions, but also the black hole spin, a marker of the formation and
accretion history of these objects. The models currently used to interpret the
reflection spectrum are often simplistic, however, approximating the disk as an
infinitely thin, optically thick plane of material orbiting in circular
Keplerian orbits around the central object. Using a new relativistic ray
tracing suite (Fenrir) that allows for more complex disk approximations, we
examine the effects that disk thickness may have on the reflection spectrum.
Assuming a lamp post corona, we find that finite disk thickness can have a
variety of effects on the reflection spectrum, including a truncation of the
blue wing (from self-shadowing of the accretion disk) and an enhancement of the
red wing (from the irradiation of the central 'eye wall' of the inner disk). We
make a first estimate on the systematic errors on black hole spin and height

primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations at small scales. UCMHs are
expected to form at early times in regions with ${\delta\rho/\rho \gtrsim
10^{-3}}$, and they are theorized to possess an extremely compact ${\rho\propto
r^{-9/4}}$ radial density profile, which enhances their observable signatures.
Nonobservation of UCMHs can thus constrain the primordial power spectrum. Using
$N$-body simulations to study the collapse of extreme density peaks at ${z
\simeq 1000}$, we show that UCMHs forming under realistic conditions do not
develop the ${\rho\propto r^{-9/4}}$ profile and instead develop either
${\rho\propto r^{-3/2}}$ or ${\rho\propto r^{-1}}$ inner density profiles
depending on the shape of the power spectrum. We also demonstrate via idealized
simulations that self-similarity---the absence of a scale length---is necessary
to produce a halo with the ${\rho\propto r^{-9/4}}$ profile, and we argue that
this implies such halos cannot form from a Gaussian primordial density field.
Prior constraints derived from UCMH nonobservation must be reworked in light of
this discovery. Although the shallower density profile reduces UCMH visibility,
our findings reduce their signal by as little as $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ while
allowing later-forming halos to be considered, which suggests that new
constraints could be significantly stronger.

The aim of this work is to validate a method to measure the underlying period
spacing, coupling term and mode offset of pure gravity modes that are present
in the deep interiors of red-giant stars. We subsequently investigate the
physical conditions of the evanescent zone between the gravity mode cavity and
the pressure mode cavity. We implement an alternative mathematical description
to analyse observational data and to extract the underlying physical parameters
that determine the frequencies of mixed modes. This description takes the
radial order of the modes explicitly into account, which reduces its
sensitivity to aliases. Additionally, and for the first time, this method
allows us to constrain the gravity mode offset for red-giant stars. We
determine the period spacing and the coupling term for the dipole modes within
a few percent of literature values. Additionally, we find that the gravity mode
offset varies on a star by star basis and should not be kept fixed in the
analysis. Furthermore, we find that the coupling factor is logarithmically
related to the physical width of the evanescent region normalised by the radius
at which the evanescent zone is located. Finally, the local density contrast at
the edge of the core of red giant branch models shows a tentative correlation
with the offset. (abstract abriged)

for compression of distributed correlated Gaussian sources. In this scheme,
each encoder quantizes its observation using the same fine lattice and reduces
the result modulo a coarse lattice. Rather than directly recovering the
individual quantized signals, the decoder first recovers a full-rank set of
judiciously chosen integer linear combinations of the quantized signals, and
then inverts it. It has been observed that the method works very well for

measure of bad covariance matrices by studying the probability that
integer-forcing source coding fails as a function of the allocated rate, %in
excess of the %Berger-Tung benchmark, where the probability is with respect to
a random orthonormal transformation that is applied to the sources prior to
quantization. For the important case where the signals to be compressed

sequence of finite rotation gates to exactly eliminate leakage errors. The
strategy is illustrated by the recently proposed charge quadrupole qubit in a
triple quantum dot, where there are two logical states to support the qubit and
one leakage state. We have found an su(2) subalgebra in the three-level system,

are universal for single-qubit gates, can be generated by two or three
propagators of experimentally-available Hamiltonians. The proposed strategy
does not require additional pulses, is independent of error magnitude, and

investigated through multi-wavelength studies of cluster samples. We
investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in a sample of seven galaxy
clusters in the largely unexplored intermediate redshift range (0.3 < z <
0.44). In search of diffuse emission, deep radio imaging of the clusters are
presented from wide band (1.1-3.1 GHz), full resolution ($\sim$ 5 arcsec)
observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The
visibilities were also imaged at lower resolution after point source modelling
and subtraction and after a taper was applied to achieve better sensitivity to
low surface brightness diffuse radio emission. In case of non-detection of
diffuse sources, we set upper limits for the radio power of injected diffuse
radio sources in the field of our observations. Furthermore, we discuss the
dynamical state of the observed clusters based on an X-ray morphological
analysis with XMM-Newton. We detect a giant radio halo in PSZ2 G284.97-23.69
(z=0.39) and a possible diffuse source in the nearly relaxed cluster PSZ2
G262.73-40.92 (z=0.421). Our sample contains three highly disturbed massive
clusters without clear traces of diffuse emission at the observed frequencies.
We were able to inject modelled radio halos with low values of total flux
density to set upper detection limits; however, with our high-frequency
observations we cannot exclude the presence of RH in these systems because of
the sensitivity of our observations in combination with the high z of the
observed clusters.

  Assessment","AAAI'18",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by the free-energy brain theory, which implies that human visual
system (HVS) tends to reduce uncertainty and restore perceptual details upon
seeing a distorted image, we propose restorative adversarial net (RAN), a
GAN-based model for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA). RAN, which
mimics the process of HVS, consists of three components: a restorator, a
discriminator and an evaluator. The restorator restores and reconstructs input
distorted image patches, while the discriminator distinguishes the
reconstructed patches from the pristine distortion-free patches. After
restoration, we observe that the perceptual distance between the restored and
the distorted patches is monotonic with respect to the distortion level. We
further define Gain of Restoration (GoR) based on this phenomenon. The
evaluator predicts perceptual score by extracting feature representations from
the distorted and restored patches to measure GoR. Eventually, the quality
score of an input image is estimated by weighted sum of the patch scores.
Experimental results on Waterloo Exploration, LIVE and TID2013 show the
effectiveness and generalization ability of RAN compared to the
state-of-the-art NR-IQA models.

set of $n$ items, each of which must be allocated to one of $m$ agents. Each
agent $\ell$ has a valuation function $v_\ell$, where $v_\ell(S)$ denotes the
welfare obtained by this agent if she receives the set of items $S$. The
functions $v_\ell$ are all submodular; as is standard, we assume that they are
monotone and $v_\ell(\emptyset) = 0$. The goal is to partition the items into
$m$ disjoint subsets $S_1, S_2, \ldots S_m$ in order to maximize the social
welfare, defined as $\sum_{\ell = 1}^m v_\ell(S_\ell)$.
  In this paper, we consider the online version of SWM. Here, items arrive one
at a time in an online manner; when an item arrives, the algorithm must make an
irrevocable decision about which agent to assign it to before seeing any
subsequent items. This problem is motivated by applications to Internet
advertising, where user ad impressions must be allocated to advertisers whose
value is a submodular function of the set of users / impressions they receive.
In the random order model, the adversary can construct a worst-case set of
items and valuations, but does not control the order in which the items arrive;
instead, they are assumed to arrive in a random order. Obtaining a competitive
ratio of $1/2 + \Omega(1)$ for the random order model has been an important
open problem for several years. We solve this open problem by demonstrating
that the greedy algorithm has a competitive ratio of at least $0.505$ for the
Online Submodular Welfare Maximization problem in the random order model. For
special cases of submodular functions including weighted matching, weighted
coverage functions and a broader class of ""second-order supermodular""
functions, we provide a different analysis that gives a competitive ratio of
$0.51$.

quasi-periodically by the streams' interaction with a nonlinear $m=1$ density
feature, or ""lump"", at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk: the stream
supplying each mini-disk comes into phase with the lump at a frequency $0.74$

tidal truncation radii of the mini-disks are not much larger than their
innermost stable circular orbits; consequently, the mini-disks' inflow times
are shorter than the conventional estimate and are comparable to the stream
modulation period. As a result, the mini-disks are always in inflow
disequilibrium, with their masses and spiral density wave structures responding
to the stream's quasi-periodic modulation. The fluctuations in each mini-disk's
mass are so large that as much as $75\%$ of the total mini-disk mass can be
contained within a single mini-disk. Such quasi-periodic modulation of the

simulation. Applying this comparison, we find that the simulations reproduce
the richness, size, and stellar mass functions of GAMA groups, as well as the
stacked weak lensing and tSZ signals in bins of group stellar mass. However,
the simulations predict X-ray luminosities that are higher than observed for
this optically-selected group sample. As the same simulations were previously
shown to match the luminosities of X-ray-selected groups, this suggests that
X-ray-selected systems may form a biased subset. Finally, we demonstrate that
our observational processing of the X-ray and tSZ signals is free of
significant biases. We find that our optical group selection procedure has,
however, some room for improvement.

$r_{500}$ are obtained for 34/45 clusters. In approximately 30% of the CC
clusters our analysis shows a central temperature drop with a statistical
significance of $>3\sigma$; this modest detection fraction is due mainly to a
combination of coarse angular resolution and modest S/N in the SZ data. Most
clusters are consistent with an isothermal profile at the largest radii near
$r_{500}$, although 9/45 show a significant temperature decrease with
increasing radius. The sample mean density profile is in good agreement with
previous studies, and shows a minimum intrinsic scatter of approximately 10%
near $0.5 \times r_{500}$. The sample mean temperature profile is consistent
with isothermal, and has an intrinsic scatter of approximately 50% independent
of radius. This scatter is significantly higher compared to earlier X-ray-only
studies, which find intrinsic scatters near 10%, likely due to a combination of
unaccounted for non-idealities in the SZ noise, projection effects, and sample

by the ""Alice and Bob"" notation of security protocols. They have been
successfully employed in the design and implementation of distributed systems.
However, there is still limited evidence of the applicability of choreographies
in the real-world setting of distributed programming, where communication
actions may fail. In this work, we propose the first choreography model that
allows for communication failures and the programming of user-defined code to
deal with such failures. We validate our model by implementing common
strategies for handling communication failures in a robust way, which in turn
can be used as a library by choreographies that assume reliable communication.
We equip our model with a typing discipline that can statically verify
reliability properties, in particular at-most-once and exactly-once delivery.
We demonstrate the applicability of our model by defining a
semantics-preserving compilation procedure towards a process calculus equipped
with unreliable I/O actions.

predict their features based on the characteristics of the base or mean
velocity profile. A 2-by-2 model linear Navier-Stokes (LNS) operator
illustrates how non-normality from mean shear distributes perturbation energy
in different velocity components of the forcing and response modes. The inverse
of their inner product, which is unity for a purely normal mechanism, is
proposed as a measure to quantify non-normality. In flows where there is
downstream spatial dependence of the base/mean, mean flow advection separates
the spatial support of forcing and response modes which impacts the inner
product. Success of mean stability analysis depends on the normality of
amplification. If the amplification is normal, the resolvent operator written
in its dyadic representation reveals that the adjoint and forward stability
modes are proportional to the forcing and response resolvent modes. If the
amplification is non-normal, then resolvent analysis is required to understand
the origin of observed flow structures. Eigenspectra and pseudospectra are used
to characterize these phenomena. Two test cases are studied: low Reynolds
number cylinder flow and turbulent channel flow. The first deals mainly with
normal mechanisms and quantification of non-normality using the inverse inner
product of the leading forcing and response modes agrees well with the product
of the resolvent norm and distance between the imaginary axis and least stable
eigenvalue. In turbulent channel flow, structures result from both normal and
non-normal mechanisms. Mean shear is exploited most efficiently by stationary
disturbances while bounds on the pseudospectra illustrate how non-normality is
responsible for the most amplified disturbances at spatial wavenumbers and
temporal frequencies corresponding to well-known turbulent structures.

polynomial system within a local region. More specifically, given a
zero-dimensional system $f_1=\cdots=f_n=0$, with
$f_i\in\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and a polydisc
$\mathbf{\Delta}\subset\mathbb{C}^n$, our method aims to certify the existence
of $k$ solutions (counted with multiplicity) within the polydisc.
  In case of success, it yields the correct result under guarantee. Otherwise,
no information is given. However, we show that our algorithm always succeeds if
$\mathbf{\Delta}$ is sufficiently small and well-isolating for a $k$-fold
solution $\mathbf{z}$ of the system.
  Our analysis of the algorithm further yields a bound on the size of the
polydisc for which our algorithm succeeds under guarantee. This bound depends
on local parameters such as the size and multiplicity of $\mathbf{z}$ as well
as the distances between $\mathbf{z}$ and all other solutions. Efficiency of
our method stems from the fact that we reduce the problem of counting the roots
in $\mathbf{\Delta}$ of the original system to the problem of solving a
truncated system of degree $k$. In particular, if the multiplicity $k$ of
$\mathbf{z}$ is small compared to the total degrees of the polynomials $f_i$,
our method considerably improves upon known complete and certified methods.
  For the special case of a bivariate system, we report on an implementation of
our algorithm, and show experimentally that our algorithm leads to a
significant improvement, when integrated as inclusion predicate into an
elimination method.

to ensure that an art gallery, represented by a simple polygon $P$, is fully
guarded. Most standard versions of this problem are known to be NP-hard. In
1987, Ghosh provided a deterministic $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation
algorithm for the case of vertex guards and edge guards in simple polygons. In
the same paper, Ghosh also conjectured the existence of constant ratio
approximation algorithms for these problems. We present here three
polynomial-time algorithms with a constant approximation ratio for guarding an
$n$-sided simple polygon $P$ using vertex guards. (i) The first algorithm, that
has an approximation ratio of 18, guards all vertices of $P$ in
$\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ time. (ii) The second algorithm, that has the same
approximation ratio of 18, guards the entire boundary of $P$ in
$\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ time. (iii) The third algorithm, that has an approximation
ratio of 27, guards all interior and boundary points of $P$ in
$\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ time. Further, these algorithms can be modified to obtain
similar approximation ratios while using edge guards. The significance of our
results lies in the fact that these results settle the conjecture by Ghosh
regarding the existence of constant-factor approximation algorithms for this
problem, which has been open since 1987 despite several attempts by
researchers. Our approximation algorithms exploit several deep visibility
structures of simple polygons which are interesting in their own right.

The first problem is that of estimating a linear functional of the means of $n$
independent $p$-dimensional Gaussian vectors, under the assumption that most of
these means are equal to zero. We show that, up to a logarithmic factor, the
minimax rate of estimation in squared Euclidean norm is between $(s^2\wedge n)
+sp$ and $(s^2\wedge np)+sp$. The estimator that attains the upper bound being
computationally demanding, we investigate suitable versions of group
thresholding estimators that are efficiently computable even when the dimension
and the sample size are very large. An interesting new phenomenon revealed by
this investigation is that the group thresholding leads to a substantial
improvement in the rate as compared to the element-wise thresholding. Thus, the
rate of the group thresholding is $s^2\sqrt{p}+sp$, while the element-wise
thresholding has an error of order $s^2p+sp$. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first known setting in which leveraging the group structure leads
to a polynomial improvement in the rate.
  The second problem studied in this work is the estimation of the common
$p$-dimensional mean of the inliers among $n$ independent Gaussian vectors. We
show that there is a strong analogy between this problem and the first one.
Exploiting it, we propose new strategies of robust estimation that are
computationally tractable and have better rates of convergence than the other
computationally tractable robust (with respect to the presence of the outliers
in the data) estimators studied in the literature. However, this tractability
comes with a loss of the minimax-rate-optimality in some regimes.

demonstrate experimentally that the limiting thermal resistance is due to the

can be used to guarantee closed-loop safety by acting as a supervisor of an
existing or legacy controller. However, supervisory-control intervention
typically compromises the performance of the closed-loop system. On the other
hand, machine learning has been used to synthesize controllers that inherit
good properties from a training dataset, though safety is typically not
guaranteed due to the difficulty of analyzing the associated neural network. In
this paper, supervised learning is combined with CBFs to synthesize controllers
that enjoy good performance with provable safety. A training set is generated
by trajectory optimization that incorporates the CBF constraint for an
interesting range of initial conditions of the truck model. A control policy is
obtained via supervised learning that maps a feature representing the initial
conditions to a parameterized desired trajectory. The learning-based controller
is used as the performance controller and a CBF-based supervisory controller
guarantees safety. A case study of lane keeping for articulated trucks shows
that the controller trained by supervised learning inherits the good
performance of the training set and rarely requires intervention by the CBF
supervisor

optical light curve are indicative of eclipses from optically thick clumps
formed in the winds of the stellar counterpart. Given the constraints on the
flare duration ($0.02 - 0.8$ d) and the time between flares ($15.1\pm7.8$ d),
we estimate the clump volume filling factor in the stellar winds, $f_V$, to be
$0.01 < f_V < 0.71$, which overlaps with values measured from massive star

function given a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without defining the reward

practice, it may be unreasonable to assume that human behaviors can be
explained by one reward function since they may be inherently inconsistent.
Also, demonstrations may be collected from various users and aggregated to
infer and predict user's behaviors. In this paper, we introduce the
Non-parametric Behavior Clustering IRL algorithm to simultaneously cluster
demonstrations and learn multiple reward functions from demonstrations that may
be generated from more than one behaviors. Our method is iterative: It
alternates between clustering demonstrations into different behavior clusters
and inverse learning the reward functions until convergence. It is built upon
the Expectation-Maximization formulation and non-parametric clustering in the
IRL setting. Further, to improve the computation efficiency, we remove the need
of completely solving multiple IRL problems for multiple clusters during the
iteration steps and introduce a resampling technique to avoid generating too
many unlikely clusters. We demonstrate the convergence and efficiency of the
proposed method through learning multiple driver behaviors from demonstrations
generated from a grid-world environment and continuous trajectories collected

respects $\mathcal{P}$ if $\mathcal{P}(G)=\mathcal{P}(G^+)$, where $G^+$ is the
group $G$ endowed with the Bohr topology. We study relations between different
respecting properties from $\mathfrak{P}$ and show that the respecting
convergent sequences (=the Schur property) is the weakest one among the
properties of $\mathfrak{P}$. We characterize respecting properties from
$\mathfrak{P}$ in wide classes of $MAP$ topological groups including the class
of metrizable $MAP$ abelian groups. Every real locally convex space (lcs) is a
quotient space of an lcs with the Schur property, and every locally
quasi-convex (lqc) abelian group is a quotient group of an lqc abelian group
with the Schur property. It is shown that a reflexive group $G$ has the Schur
property or respects compactness iff its dual group $G^\wedge$ is
$c_0$-barrelled or $g$-barrelled, respectively. We prove that a locally
quasi-convex abelian $k_\omega$-group respects all properties
$\mathcal{P}\in\mathfrak{P}$. As an application of the obtained results we show
that (1) the space $C_k(X)$ is a reflexive group for every separable metrizable

implications of the double-Chooz data on both oscillation parameters
$\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$, we decided to analyze the data
corresponding to the Far detector, with no additional restriction. By doing
this, confidence regions and best fit values are obtained for
($\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13}),\Delta m^2_{31}$). This analysis yields an
out-of-order $\Delta m^2_{31}$ minimum, which has already been mentioned in
previous works, and it is corrected with the inclusion of additional
restrictions. With such restrictions it is obtained that $\sin ^{2}(2 \theta

m^2_{31}=2.444^{+0.187}_{-0.215} \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$/c$^4$. Our analysis
allows us to study the effects of the so called ""spectral bump"" around 5 MeV,
it is observed that a variation of this spectral bump may be able to move the
$\Delta m^2_{31}$ best fit value, in such a way that $\Delta m^2_{31}$ takes
the order of magnitude of the MINOS value. Finally, and with the intention of
understanding the effects of the preliminary Near detector data, we performed
two different analyses, aiming to eliminate the effects of the energy bump. As
a consequence, it is found that unlike the Far Detector analysis, the Near
detector data may be able to fully determine both oscillation parameters by
itself, resulting in, $\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) = 0.095 \pm 0.053$ and $\Delta
m^{2}_{31} = 2.63^{+0.98}_{-1.15} \times 10^{-3} \text{eV}^2 / \text{c}^4$. The
later analyses represent an improvement with respect to previous works, where

we examine three limiting cases where dissipation in the rolling droplet is
dominated by viscous dissipation, surface friction, or contact line friction.
We find that in molecular dynamics simulations of droplets on ideal

dissipation dominates droplet motion. However, on real leaves, droplet motion

\{u,\Delta u\} + ku_y$$ describes the time evolution of drift waves in
magnetically-confined plasma. Several authors have treated the HM equation
theoretically and numerically, with difficulties arising when handling the
non-linear Poisson's bracket $\{u,\Delta u\}:=u_x\Delta u_u-u_y\Delta u_x $. In
this paper, we introduce a new decoupling approach that avoids the Poisson's
bracket term by reformulating the HM equation as a system of two linear PDEs, a
solution of which is a pair $(u,w)$ such that
$$(HM)\,\,\,\left\{\begin{array}{lll} w_t + \vec{V}(u) \cdot \nabla w = ku_y\\

coupled hyperbolic-elliptic system, we derive several variational frames, all
propitious for finding weak solutions with spacial periodic boundary conditions
and lower regularity assumptions on the initial data. More precisely, for
initial data $u_0 \in H_P^2(\Omega)$ with $w_0:=(I-\Delta) u_0 \in

And for initial data $u_0 \in H_P^3(\Omega)$ with $w_0:=(I-\Delta) u_0 \in

fixed-point ordered pairs $\{u_N,w_N\}$ that solve Petrov-Galerkin HM systems,
constructed using spacial Fourier basis. Through appropriate a-priori estimates
combined with compactness arguments, we reach when $N\to\infty$ limit point

have been applied to many security-critical scenarios. For example, deep
learning-based face recognition systems have been used to authenticate users to
access many security-sensitive applications like payment apps. Such usages of
deep learning systems provide the adversaries with sufficient incentives to
perform attacks against these systems for their adversarial purposes. In this
work, we consider a new type of attacks, called backdoor attacks, where the
attacker's goal is to create a backdoor into a learning-based authentication
system, so that he can easily circumvent the system by leveraging the backdoor.
Specifically, the adversary aims at creating backdoor instances, so that the
victim learning system will be misled to classify the backdoor instances as a
target label specified by the adversary. In particular, we study backdoor
poisoning attacks, which achieve backdoor attacks using poisoning strategies.
Different from all existing work, our studied poisoning strategies can apply
under a very weak threat model: (1) the adversary has no knowledge of the model
and the training set used by the victim system; (2) the attacker is allowed to
inject only a small amount of poisoning samples; (3) the backdoor key is hard
to notice even by human beings to achieve stealthiness. We conduct evaluation
to demonstrate that a backdoor adversary can inject only around 50 poisoning
samples, while achieving an attack success rate of above 90%. We are also the
first work to show that a data poisoning attack can create physically
implementable backdoors without touching the training process. Our work
demonstrates that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to a learning
system, and thus highlights the importance of further investigation and
proposing defense strategies against them.

rearrangements of particles. The inspection of soft vibrational modes can help
predict the locations of these rearrangements, while the strain that they
actually redistribute mediates collective effects. Here, we study soft modes
and strain redistribution in a two-dimensional continuous mesoscopic model
based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for perfect solids, supplemented with a
plastic disorder potential that accounts for shear softening and
rearrangements. Regardless of the disorder strength, our numerical simulations
show soft modes that are always sharply peaked at the softest point of the
material (unlike what happens for the depinning of an elastic interface).
Contrary to widespread views, the deformation halo around this peak does not
always have a quadrupolar (Eshelby-like) shape. Instead, for finite and
narrowly-distributed disorder, it looks like a fracture, with a strain field
that concentrates along some easy directions. These findings are rationalised
with analytical calculations in the case where the plastic disorder is confined
to a point-like `impurity'. In this case, we unveil a continuous family of
elastic propagators, which are identical for the soft modes and for the
equilibrium configurations. This family interpolates between the standard
quadrupolar propagator and the fracture-like one as the anisotropy of the
elastic medium is increased. Therefore, we expect to see a fracture-like
propagator when extended regions on the brink of failure have already softened
along the shear direction and thus rendered the material anisotropic, but not
failed yet. We speculate that this might be the case in carefully aged glasses
just before macroscopic failure.

pseudo-Newtonian potential is adopted to mimic the effect of general
relativity. The flow encounters energy loss by means of radiative processes
acted on the electrons and at the same time, flow heats up as a consequence of
viscous heating effective on ions. We assumed that the flow is exposed with the
stochastic magnetic fields which leads to Synchrotron emission of electrons and
these emissions are further strengthen by Compton scattering. We obtain the
two-temperature global accretion solutions in terms of dissipation parameters,
namely, viscosity ($\alpha$) and accretion rate (${\dot m}$), and find for the
first time in the literature that such solutions may contain standing shock
waves. Solutions of this kind are multi-transonic in nature as they
simultaneously pass through both inner critical point ($x_{\rm in}$) and outer
critical point ($x_{\rm out}$) before crossing the black hole horizon. We
calculate the properties of shock induced global accretion solutions in terms
of the flow parameters. We further show that two-temperature shocked accretion
flow is not a discrete solution, instead such solution exists for wide range of
flow parameters. We identify the effective domain of the parameter space for
standing shock and observe that parameter space shrinks as the dissipation is
increased. Since the post-shock region is hotter due to the effect of shock
compression, it naturally emits hard X-rays and therefore, the two-temperature
shocked accretion solution has the potential to explain the spectral properties

variational real-space formulation of Kohn-Sham DFT expressed in terms of the
non-orthogonal wavefunctions that is amenable to reduced-order scaling
techniques. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed
configurational force approach on benchmark all-electron and pseudopotential
calculations conducted using higher-order finite-element discretization. To
this end, we examine the rates of convergence of the finite-element
discretization in the computed forces and stresses for various materials

Wherever applicable, we also compare the forces and stresses with those

density functional formalism. The exchange holes modeled using DME possess
unique features that make it a superior entity. Parameterized semilocal
exchange energy functionals based on the DME are proposed. The use of different
forms of the momentum and flexible parameters is to subsume the non-uniform
effects of the density in the newly constructed semilocal functionals. In
addition to the exchange functionals, a suitable correlation functional is also
constructed by working upon the local correlation functional developed for 2D
homogeneous electron gas (2D-HEG). The non-local effects are induced into the
correlation functional by a parametric form of one of the newly constructed
exchange energy functionals. The proposed functionals are applied to the
parabolic quantum dots with a varying number of confined electrons and the
confinement strength. The results obtained with the aforementioned functionals
are quite satisfactory which indicates why these are suitable for

attracted a great deal of interest as a driven-dissipative quantum fluid. These
systems offer themselves as a versatile platform for performing Hamiltonian
simulations with light, as well as for experimentally realizing nontrivial
out-of-equilibrium phase transitions. In addition, polaritons exhibit a
sizeable mutual interaction strength that opens up a whole range of
possibilities in the context of quantum state generation. While squeezed light
emission from polaritons has been reported previously, the granular nature of
polaritons has not been observed to date. The latter capability is particularly
attractive for realizing strongly correlated many-body quantum states of light
on scalable arrays of coupled cavities. Here we demonstrate that by optically
confining polaritons to a very small effective mode volume, one can reach the
weak blockade regime, in which the nonlinearity turns strong enough to become
significant at the few particle level, and thus produce a non-negligible
antibunching in the emitted photons statistics. Our results act as a door
opener for accessing the newly emerging field of quantum polaritonics, and as a

  Langford sequences",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A magic square of order $n$ with all subsquares of possible orders
(ASMS$(n)$) is a magic square which contains a general magic square of each
order $k\in\{3, 4, \cdots, n-2\}$. Since the conjecture on the existence of an
ASMS was proposed in 1994, much attention has been paid but very little is
known except for few sporadic examples. A $k$-extended Langford sequence of
defect $d$ and length $m$ is equivalent to a partition of
$\{1,2,\cdots,2m+1\}\backslash\{k\}$ into differences $\{d,\cdots,d+m-1\}$. In
this paper, a construction of ASMS based on extended Langford sequence is
established. As a result, it is shown that there exists an ASMS$(n)$ for
$n\equiv\pm3\pmod{18}$, which gives a partial answer to Abe's conjecture on
ASMS.

grain shape parameters and transparency values. It is found that the sample
classification is more consistent with their eruption style in the case of
using both parameters of grain shape and transparency. By sampling several
layers of an outcrop, this procedure can be used to interpret changes in
eruption/fragmentation style during a volcanic event. Furthermore, this

transition for the organic charge-transfer salt
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl. To this end, disorder was introduced
into the system in a controlled way by exposing the single crystals to x-ray
irradiation. The crystals were then fine-tuned across the Mott transition by
the application of continuously controllable He-gas pressure at low
temperatures. Measurements of the thermal expansion and resistance show that
the first-order character of the Mott transition prevails for low irradiation
doses achieved by irradiation times up to 100 h. For these crystals with a
moderate degree of disorder, we find a first-order transition line which ends
in a second-order critical endpoint, akin to the pristine crystals. Compared to
the latter, however, we observe a significant reduction of both, the critical
pressure $p_c$ and the critical temperature $T_c$. This result is consistent
with the theoretically-predicted formation of a soft Coulomb gap in the
presence of strong correlations and small disorder. Furthermore, we
demonstrate, similar to the observation for the pristine sample, that the Mott
transition after 50 h of irradiation is accompanied by sizable lattice effects,
the critical behavior of which can be well described by mean-field theory. Our
results demonstrate that the character of the Mott transition remains
essentially unchanged at a low disorder level. However, after an irradiation
time of 150 h, no clear signatures of a discontinuous metal-insulator
transition could be revealed anymore. These results suggest that, above a
certain disorder level, the metal-insulator transition becomes a smeared
first-order transition with some residual hysteresis.

that contain direct information about the generating process. We present the
performance of a new valuable tool to estimate the inverse solution of
gravitational wave transient signals, starting from the analysis of the signal
properties of a non-template algorithm that is open to a wider class of
gravitational signals not covered by template algorithms. We highlight the
contributions to the wave polarization associated with the detector response,
the sky localization and the polarization angle of the source. In this paper we
present the performances of such method and its implications by using two main
classes of transient signals, resembling the limiting case for most simple and
complicated morphologies. Performances are encouraging, for the tested
waveforms: the correlation between the original and the reconstructed waveforms
spans from better than 80% for simple morphologies to better than 50% for
complicated ones. For a not-template search this results can be considered
satisfactory to reconstruct the astrophysical progenitor.

precisely how the verification engine can compute such non-provability

proposed for two-dimensional (2-D) direction of- arrival (DOA) and polarization
estimation of non-circular signal in three-dimensional (3-D) millimeter wave
polarized largescale/ massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
The traditional MUSIC-based algorithms can estimate either the DOA and
polarization for circular signal or the DOA for non-circular signal by using
spectrum search. By contrast, in the proposed algorithm only the DOA estimation
needs spectrum search, and the polarization estimation has a closedform
expression. First, a novel dimension-reduced MUSIC (DRMUSIC) is proposed for
DOA and polarization estimation of circular signal with low computational
complexity. Next, based on the quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named
quaternion non-circular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed for parameter estimation
of non-circular signal with high estimation accuracy. Then based on the DOA
estimation result using QNC-MUSIC, the polarization estimation of non-circular
signal is acquired by using the closed-form expression of the polarization
estimation in DR-MUSIC. In addition, the computational complexity analysis
shows that compared with the conventional DOA and polarization estimation
algorithms, our proposed QNC-MUSIC and DRMUSIC have much lower computational
complexity, especially when the source number is large. The stochastic
Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the 2-D DOA and polarization
parameters of the non-circular signals is derived as well. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve
the parameter estimation performance when the large-scale/massive MIMO systems

to non-equilibrium dynamics of time-independent systems induced by a quantum

return probability of a system to the ground state reveals singularities in
time which are dubbed dynamical quantum phase transitions. We show that the
quantum quench in a discrete time crystal leads to dynamical quantum phase
transitions where the return probability of a periodically driven system to a

motion of superluminal knots and transverse stratification of their jet. Recent
observational projects have provided new observational constraints on the
central region of rotating black holes in AGN, suggesting that there is an
inner- or spine-jet surrounded by a disk wind. This relativistic spine-jet is
likely to be composed of electron - positron pairs extracting energy from the
black hole. In this article we present an extension and generalization to
relativistic jets in Kerr metric of the meridional self similar mechanism. We
aim at modeling the inner spine-jet of AGN as the relativistic light outflow
emerging from a spherical corona surrounding a Kerr black hole. The model is
built by expanding the metric and the forces with colatitude to first order in
the magnetic flux function. Conversely to previous models, effects of the light
cylinder are not neglected. Solutions with high Lorentz factor are obtained and
provide spine-jet models up to the polar axis. As in previous publications, we
calculate the magnetic collimation efficiency parameter, which measures the
variation of the available energy across the field lines. This collimation
efficiency is an integral of the model, generalizing to Kerr metric the
classical magnetic rotator efficiency criterion. We study the variation of the
magnetic efficiency and acceleration with the spin of the black hole and show
their high sensitivity to this integral. These new solutions model collimated
or radial, relativistic or ultra-relativistic outflows. We discuss the
relevance of our solutions to model the M87 spine-jet. We study the efficiency
of the central black hole spin to collimate a spine-jet and show that the jet
power is of the same order with that determined by numerical simulations.

  Compiling bytecode to native code to improve performance has been studied

improve performance, but produces code several times larger than the optimised
C equivalent, limiting the size of programmes that can fit onto a device.
  This paper identifies the major sources of overhead resulting from this basic
approach, and presents optimisations to remove most of the remaining
performance overhead, and over half the size overhead, reducing them to 69% and
91% respectively. While this increases the size of the VM, the break-even point

regularization methods and test problems for large-scale linear inverse
problems. The software package, called IR Tools, serves two related purposes:
we provide implementations of a range of iterative solvers, including several
recently proposed methods that are not available elsewhere, and we provide a
set of large-scale test problems in the form of discretizations of 2D linear
inverse problems. The solvers include iterative regularization methods where
the regularization is due to the semi-convergence of the iterations,
Tikhonov-type formulations where the regularization is explicitly formulated in
the form of a regularization term, and methods that can impose bound
constraints on the computed solutions. All the iterative methods are
implemented in a very flexible fashion that allows the problem's coefficient
matrix to be available as a (sparse) matrix, a function handle, or an object.
The most basic call to all of the various iterative methods requires only this
matrix and the right hand side vector; if the method uses any special stopping
criteria, regularization parameters, etc., then default values are set
automatically by the code. Moreover, through the use of an optional input
structure, the user can also have full control of any of the algorithm
parameters. The test problems represent realistic large-scale problems found in
image reconstruction and several other applications. Numerical examples
illustrate the various algorithms and test problems available in this package.

distributions of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high-transverse
momentum trigger hadron in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =5.02$ TeV.
Jets are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$
algorithm with resolution parameter $R=0.2$ and $0.4$. A data-driven
statistical approach is used to correct the uncorrelated background jet yield.
Recoil jet distributions are reported for jet transverse momentum $15<p_{\rm
T,jet}^{\rm ch} <50$ GeV/$c$ and are compared in various intervals of p-Pb
event activity, based on charged-particle multiplicity and zero-degree neutral
energy in the forward (Pb-going) direction. The semi-inclusive observable is
self-normalized and such comparisons do not require the interpretation of p-Pb
event activity in terms of collision geometry, in contrast to inclusive jet
observables. These measurements provide new constraints on the magnitude of jet
quenching in small systems at the LHC. In p-Pb collisions with high event
activity, the average medium-induced out-of-cone energy transport for jets with
$R=0.4$ and $15<p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}<50$ GeV/$c$ is measured to be less than
0.4 GeV/$c$ at 90% confidence, which is over an order of magnitude smaller than
a similar measurement for central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$
TeV. Comparison is made to theoretical calculations of jet quenching in small
systems, and to inclusive jet measurements in p-Pb collisions selected by event
activity at the LHC and in d-Au collisions at RHIC.

discs may be much less stable against gravitational collapse than their non
turbulent analogs, due to stochastic density fluctuations in turbulent flows.
This mode of fragmentation would be especially important for gas giant planet
formation. Here we argue, however, that stochastic density fluctuations due to
turbulence do not enhance gravitational instability and disc fragmentation in
the long cooling time limit appropriate for planet forming discs. These
fluctuations evolve adiabatically and dissipate away by decompression faster
than they could collapse. We investigate these issues numerically in 2D via
shearing box simulations with driven turbulence and also in 3D with a model of
instantaneously applied turbulent velocity kicks. In the former setting
turbulent driving leads to additional disc heating that tends to make discs
more, rather than less, stable to gravitational instability. In the latter
setting, the formation of high density regions due to convergent velocity kicks
is found to be quickly followed by decompression, as expected. We therefore
conclude that driven turbulence does not promote disc fragmentation in
protoplanetary discs and instead tends to make the discs more stable. We also
argue that sustaining supersonic turbulence is very difficult in discs that
cool slowly.

observe an unexpected behavior in the concurrence, that is below
pseudo-critical temperature the concurrence remains almost constant up to
pseudo-critical temperature, but above the pseudo-critical temperature, the
concurrence behaves as for the standard one-dimensional spin models. Further,
we consider the entropy behavior of the system, below pseudo-critical
temperature the entropy becomes almost null, while above pseudo-critical
temperature the system exhibits standard behavior as for ordinary
one-dimensional spin models.

2000 and 2005, the X-ray flux has now increased by a factor of ~2.5, and
slightly hardened. The new observations also extend the observational coverage
over the entire orbit, pinpointing the lightcurve shape. It has not varied much
despite the large overall brightening, and a tight correlation of fluxes with
orbital separation is found, without any hysteresis effect. Moreover, the
absence of eclipses and of absorption effects related to orientation suggests a
large size for the X-ray emitting region. Simple analytical models of the
wind-wind collision, considering the varying wind properties of the eruptive
component in HD5980, are able to reproduce the recent hardening and the
flux-separation relationship, at least qualitatively, but they predict a
hardening at apastron and little change in mean flux, contrary to observations.
The brightness change could then possibly be related to a recently theorized
phenomenon linked to the varying strength of thin-shell instabilities in
shocked wind regions.

through a node-link diagram. Node-attribute graphs have additional data stored
on the nodes which describe certain properties of the nodes called attributes.
Typical force-directed representations often produce hairball-like structures
that neither aid in understanding the graph's topology nor the relationship to
its attributes. The aim of this research was to investigate the use of
node-attributes for graph layout in order to improve the analysis process and
to give further insight into the graph over purely topological layouts. In this
article we present graphTPP, a graph based extension to targeted projection
pursuit (TPP) --- an interactive, linear, dimension reduction technique --- as
a method for graph layout and subsequent further analysis. TPP allows users to
control the projection and is optimised for clustering. Three case studies were
conducted in the areas of influence graphs, network security, and citation
networks. In each case graphTPP was shown to outperform standard force-directed
techniques and even other dimension reduction methods in terms of clarity of
clustered structure in the layout, the association between the structure and
the attributes and the insights elicited in each domain area.

automatically to changing image conditions, e.g. illumination or berry color.
The framework was tested on three datasets consisting in total of 139 images.

Unfortunately, reconfigurations cannot be too frequent due to a number of

guarantee a good-quality routing regardless of the transition instant.

determines parameters of the weak interaction and predictions of primordial
nucleosynthesis theory. There remains the unsolved problem of a 3.9{\sigma}
discrepancy between measurements of this lifetime using neutrons in beams and
those with stored neutrons (UCN). In our experiment we measure the lifetime of
neutrons trapped by Earth's gravity in an open-topped vessel. Two
configurations of the trap geometry are used to change the mean frequency of
UCN collisions with the surfaces - this is achieved by plunging an additional
surface into the trap without breaking the vacuum. The trap walls are coated
with a hydrogen-less fluorine-containing polymer to reduce losses of UCN. The
stability of this coating to multiple thermal cycles between 80 K and 300 K was
tested. At 80 K, the probability of UCN loss due to collisions with the trap
walls is just 1.5% of the probability of beta-decay. The free neutron lifetime
is determined by extrapolation to an infinitely large trap with zero collision
frequency. The result of these measurements is 881.5 +/- 0.7_stat +/- 0.6_syst
s which is consistent with the conventional value of 880.2 +/- 1.0 s presented
by the Particle Data Group. Future prospects for this experiment are in further
cooling to 10 K which will lead to an improved accuracy of measurement. In
conclusion we present an analysis of currently-available data on various
measurements of the neutron lifetime.

and biological systems. In general, the former allows to introduce elements of
novelty, while the latter is responsible for the motion of a system in its
phase space. Often, these processes are strongly related, since an innovation
can trigger the evolution, and the latter can provide the optimal conditions
for the emergence of innovations. Both processes can be studied by using the
framework of Evolutionary Game Theory, where evolution constitutes an intrinsic
mechanism, while innovation requires an opportune representation. Notably,
innovation can be modeled as a strategy, or can constitute the underlying
mechanism which allows agents to change strategy. Here, we analyze the second
case, investigating the behavior of a heterogeneous population, composed of
imitative and innovative agents. Imitative agents change strategy only by
imitating that of their neighbors, whereas innovative ones change strategy
without the need of a copying source. The proposed model is analyzed by means
of analytical calculations and numerical simulations in a square lattice.
Remarkably, results indicate that the mixing of mechanisms can lead to
different behaviors, being sometimes beneficial and others detrimental to
cooperation. Our investigation sheds some light on the complex dynamics
emerging from the heterogeneity of strategy revision methods, highlighting the
role of innovation in evolutionary games.

Chempy, which marginalises over galactic parameters describing simple stellar

methods are presented, based on Bayesian evidence and leave-one-out
cross-validation and are applied to five CC-SN tables, (a) for all mutually
available elements and (b) for a subset of the 9 most abundant elements. We
find that the yields of Prantzos et al. (P18, including stellar rotation) and
Chieffi & Limongi (C04) best reproduce proto-solar abundances for the two
cases, respectively. The inferred best-fit SSP parameters for (b) are
$\alpha_\mathrm{IMF}=-2.45^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ for the initial mass function

dramatically improve elemental abundance predictions of hydrodynamical

because of a UV catastrophe similar to that of black body radiation, radiative

ratio on the number of parameters while preserving the representation power of
the original FC-layers as much as possible. Specifically, we can get a higher

frequency shifts are observed to increase towards higher-order modes to reach a
maximum of about 0.8 muHz over the 11-yr solar cycle. A comparable frequency
dependence is also measured in two other main-sequence solar-like stars, the
F-star HD49933, and the young 1-Gyr-old solar analog KIC10644253, although with

through an assisting model when the model captures some of the relationship
between the auxiliary data and the study variables. Despite their superior
properties, model-assisted estimators are rarely used in anything but their
simplest form by statistical agencies to produce official statistics. This is
due to the fact that the more complicated models that have been used in
model-assisted estimation are often ill suited to the available auxiliary data.
Under a model-assisted framework, we propose a regression tree estimator for a
finite population total. Regression tree models are adept at handling the type
of auxiliary data usually available in the sampling frame and provide a model
that is easy to explain and justify. The estimator can be viewed as a
post-stratification estimator where the post-strata are automatically selected
by the recursive partitioning algorithm of the regression tree. We establish
consistency of the regression tree estimator and compare its performance to
other survey estimators using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational
Employment Statistics Survey.

bringing improved radioactive background conditions to the region of interest

Furthermore, a Computational Fluid-Dynamics analysis has been performed, based
on the empirical measurements provided by the thermal monitoring system, and
providing information into present and future thermal trends. A two-dimensional

the thermal and fluid-dynamics in Borexino. It was optimized for different

simple graph with nonnegative real edge weights is well known in industrial and
electrical engineering, systems biology, sociology and finance. As the problem
is known to be NP-hard, much research effort has been devoted over the years to
attempt to improve a given approximate solution to the problem by using local
moves applied to a planar embedding of the solution. It has long been
established that any feasible solution to the problem, a maximal planar graph,
can be transformed into any other (having the same vertex set) in a finite
sequence of local moves of based on: (i) edge substitution and (ii) vertex
relocation and it has been conjectured that moves of only type (i) are
sufficient. In this note we settle this conjecture in the affirmative.
Furthermore, contrary to recent supposition, we demonstrate that any maximal
spanning tree of the original graph is not necessarily a part of any optimal
solution to the problem. We hope these results will be useful in the design of
future approximate methods for the problem.

the possibility of making Relativity the {\em general standard frame} in which

  Because the velocity of propagation of the information is finite, {\em

RPSs and RSSs complete the notion of {\em laboratory} in general relativity,
allowing to perform experiments in finite regions of any space-time.
  Epistemic relativity incites the development of relativity in new open
directions: advanced studies in RPSs and RSSs, intrinsic characterization of
gravitational fields, composition laws for them, construction of a
finite-differential geometry adapted to RPSs and RSSs, covariant approximation
methods, etc. Some of these directions are sketched here, and some open

Furthermore, the pairwise kSZ signal might be affected by internal cluster
motions or correlations between velocity and optical depth. We investigate
these effects using the Magneticum cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, one
of the largest simulations of this kind performed to date. We produce tSZ and

the average Compton-$y$ parameter and optical depth. We show that this relation
can be used to recover an accurate estimate of the mean pairwise velocity from

cosmology. We discuss the impact of theoretical and observational systematic

normal form with no ties and pure strategies: the Perfectly Transparent
Equilibrium. The players are rational in all possible worlds and know each
other's strategies in all possible worlds, which together we refer to as
Perfect Prediction. The anticipation of a player's decision by their opponents
is counterfactually dependent on the decision, unlike in Nash Equilibra where
the decisions are made independently. The equilibrium, when it exists, is
unique and is Pareto optimal.
  This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart of the Perfect Prediction
Equilibrium; the prediction happens ""in another room"" rather than in the past.
The equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter's
superrationality to non-symmetric games.
  Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational
strategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a
strategy profile that is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible
worlds and rationality in all possible worlds, a stronger concept than common
knowledge of rationality but also than common counterfactual belief of
rationality.
  We formalize and contrast the Non-Nashian Decision Theory paradigm, common to
this and several other papers, with Causal Decision Theory and Evidential
Decision Theory. We define the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium
algorithmically and, when it exists, prove its uniqueness, its
Pareto-optimality, and that it coincides with the Hofstadter's Superrationality
on symmetric games.
  We also relate to concepts found in literature such as Individual
Rationality, Minimax-Rationalizability, the Correlated Equilibrium.
  Finally, we specifically discuss inclusion relationships on the special case
of symmetric games and contrast them with asymmetric games.

velocity (RV) observations obtained within the CARMENES survey for exoplanets
around M dwarfs. HD 147379 ($V = 8.9$ mag, $M = 0.58 \pm 0.08$ M$_{\odot}$), a
bright M0.0V star at a distance of 10.7 pc, is found to undergo periodic RV
variations with a semi-amplitude of $K = 5.1\pm0.4$ m s$^{-1}$ and a period of
$P = 86.54\pm0.06$ d. The RV signal is found in our CARMENES data, which were
taken between 2016 and 2017, and is supported by HIRES/Keck observations that
were obtained since 2000. The RV variations are interpreted as resulting from a
planet of minimum mass $m_{\rm p}\sin{i} = 25 \pm 2$ M$_{\oplus}$, 1.5 times
the mass of Neptune, with an orbital semi-major axis $a = 0.32$ au and low
eccentricity ($e < 0.13$). HD 147379b is orbiting inside the temperate zone
around the star, where water could exist in liquid form. The RV time-series and
various spectroscopic indicators show additional hints of variations at an
approximate period of 21.1d (and its first harmonic), which we attribute to the
rotation period of the star.

clinical drug development and pharmacokinetic analysis for the quantification
of sulfated polysaccharides in human plasma. The present study describes the
application of Heparin Red to the detection of heparin, a highly sulfated

and rat plasmas. While the standard assay protocol for human plasma matrix gave
less satisfactory results, a modified protocol was developed that provides
within a detection range 0 to 10 micrograms per mL better limits of
quantification, 1.1 to 2.3 micrograms per mL for heparin, and 1.7 to 3.4
micrograms per mL for fucoidan. The required plasma sample volume of only 20

scale-dependent fields $\mathbf{u}_a(x)$, defined as wavelet-coefficients of
the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ taken at point $x$ with the resolution $a$.
Applying quantum field theory approach of stochastic hydrodynamics to the
generating functional of random fields $\mathbf{u}_a(x)$, we have shown the
velocity field correlators $\langle \mathbf{u}_{a_1}(x_1)\ldots
\mathbf{u}_{a_n}(x_n)\rangle$ to be finite by construction for the random
stirring force acting at prescribed large scale $L$. The study is performed in
$d=3$ dimension. Since there are no divergences, regularization is not
required, and the renormalization group invariance becomes merely a symmetry
that relates velocity fluctuations of different scales in terms of the
Kolmogorov-Richardson picture of turbulence development. The integration over
the scale arguments is performed from the external scale $L$ down to the
observation scale $A$, which lies in Kolmogorov range $l \ll A \ll L$. Our
oversimplified model is full dissipative: interaction between scales is
provided only locally by the gradient vertex $(\mathbf{u}\nabla) \mathbf{u}$,
neglecting any effects or parity violation that might be responsible for energy
backscatter. The corrections to viscosity and the pair velocity correlator are
calculated in one-loop approximation. This gives the dependence of turbulent
viscosity on observation scale and describes the scale dependence of the
velocity field correlations.

in the Social Network Analysis playground. To support students, teachers,
developers and researchers in this work we introduce a novel framework, namely
NDlib, an environment designed to describe diffusion simulations. NDlib is
designed to be a multi-level ecosystem that can be fruitfully used by different
user segments. For this reason, upon NDlib, we designed a simulation server
that allows remote execution of experiments as well as an online visualization
tool that abstracts its programmatic interface and makes available the
simulation platform to non-technicians.

theory of the friction of fluids'. According to the records, a treatise by
Euler with the title 'Tentamen theoriae de frictione fluidorum' was presented
to the St. Petersburg Academy on June 17, 1754, and perhaps was read to the
Berlin Academy on December 2, 1751. In this treatise, Euler assumes that as for
the solid friction, the fluid friction is proportional to the applied normal
force. A detailed development of five different problems of discharge are
presented in his treatise, taking into account the loss of head in the
conduits. In the appendix, an example is given for the calculation of the jet
heights of a particular fountain, fed with conduits of different amplitudes.
