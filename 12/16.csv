Ioannou","Is spontaneous generation of coherent baroclinic flows possible?","submitted to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Geophysical turbulence is observed to self-organize into large-scale flows
such as zonal jets and coherent vortices. Previous studies on barotropic
beta-plane turbulence have shown that coherent flows emerge out of a background
of homogeneous turbulence as a bifurcation when the turbulence intensity
increases and the emergence of large scale flows has been attributed to a new
type of collective, symmetry breaking instability of the statistical state
dynamics of the turbulent flow. In this work we extend the analysis to
stratified flows and investigate turbulent self-organization in a two-layer
fluid with no imposed mean north-south thermal gradient and turbulence
supported by an external random stirring. We use a second order closure of the
statistical state dynamics (S3T) with an appropriate averaging ansatz that
allows the identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and their
structural stability. The bifurcation of the statistically homogeneous
equilibrium state to inhomogeneous equilibrium states comprising of zonal jets
and/or large scale waves when the energy input rate of the excitation passes a
critical threshold is analytically studied. The theory predicts that when the
flow transitions to a statistical state with large-scale structures, these
states are barotropic if the scale of excitation is larger than the deformation
radius. Mixed barotropic-baroclinic states with jets and/or waves arise when
the excitation is at scales shorter than the deformation radius with the
baroclinic component of the flow being subdominant for low energy input rates
and non-significant for higher energy input rates. The results of the S3T
theory are compared to nonlinear simulations. The theory is found to accurately
predict both the critical transition arameters and the scales of the emergent
structures but underestimates their amplitude.

contains a lot of encrypted traffic making it increasingly difficult to find

Internet-of-Things further complicates the process for non-technical

is close to a point where data cannot be analysed without supervision of a
digital investigator with advanced network knowledge. Current investigations
focus on analysing all traffic in a chronological manner and are predominately
conducted on the data contents of the intercepted traffic. This approach often
becomes overly arduous when the amount of data to be analysed becomes very
large. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to analyse large amounts of
intercepted network traffic based on network metadata. Our approach
significantly reduces the duration of the analysis and also produces an insight

the derivation of a general asymptotic expression for the mutual information in

simultaneously for both equilibria originating from the previous one.

several decision makers are considered simultaneously, who interact with each
other through information exchange. Second, a multistep procedure is treated,
when the agents exchange information many times. Several decision makers
exchanging information and forming their judgement, using quantum rules, form a
kind of a quantum information network, where collective decisions develop in
time as a result of information exchange. In addition to characterizing
collective decisions that arise in human societies, such networks can describe
dynamical processes occurring in artificial quantum intelligence composed of
several parts or in a cluster of quantum computers. The practical usage of the

The well-known Sensitivity Conjecture states that for any Boolean function $f$,
block sensitivity of $f$ is at most polynomial in sensitivity of $f$ (denoted
by $\s(f)$). The XOR Log-Rank Conjecture states that for any $n$ bit Boolean
function, $f$ the communication complexity of a related function $f^{\oplus}$
on $2n$ bits, (defined as $f^{\oplus}(x,y)=f(x\oplus y)$) is at most polynomial
in logarithm of the sparsity of $f$ (denoted by $\sp(f)$). A recent result of
Lin and Zhang (2017) implies that to confirm the above conjectures it suffices
to upper bound alternation of $f$ (denoted $\al(f)$) for all Boolean functions
$f$ by polynomial in $\s(f)$ and logarithm of $\sp(f)$, respectively. In this
context, we show the following :
  * There exists a family of Boolean functions for which $\al(f)$ is at least
exponential in $\s(f)$ and $\al(f)$ is at least exponential in $\log \sp(f)$.
En route to the proof, we also show an exponential gap between $\al(f)$ and the
decision tree complexity of $f$, which might be of independent interest.
  * As our main result, we show that, despite the above gap between $\al(f)$
and $\log \sp(f)$, the XOR Log-Rank Conjecture is true for functions with the
alternation upper bounded by $poly(\log n)$. It is easy to observe that the
Sensitivity Conjecture is also true for this class of functions.
  * The starting point for the above result is the observation (derived from
Lin and Zhang (2017)) that for any Boolean function $f$ and $m \ge 2$,
$deg(f)\le \al(f)deg_2(f)deg_m(f)$ where $deg(f)$, $deg_2(f)$ and $deg_m(f)$
are the degrees of $f$ over $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m$
respectively. We also show three further applications of this observation.

critical solution has only one unstable, growing mode, which is spherically
symmetric. For supercritical data it controls the black hole mass, while for
subcritical data it controls the maximum density. For $\kappa<1/9$, an
additional axial $l=1$ mode becomes unstable. This controls either the black
hole angular momentum, or the maximum angular velocity. In theory, the
additional unstable $l=1$ mode changes the nature of the black hole threshold
completely: at sufficiently large initial rotation rates $\Omega$ and
sufficient fine-tuning of the initial data to the black hole threshold we
expect to observe nontrivial universal scaling functions (familiar from
critical phase transitions in thermodynamics) governing the black hole mass and
angular momentum, and, with further fine-tuning, eventually a finite black hole
mass almost everywhere on the threshold. In practice, however, the second
unstable mode grows so slowly that we do not observe this breakdown of scaling
at the level of fine-tuning we can achieve, nor systematic deviations from the
leading-order power-law scalings of the black hole mass. We do see systematic
effects in the black-hole angular momentum, but it is not clear yet if these
are due to the predicted non-trivial scaling functions, or to nonlinear effects
at sufficiently large initial angular momentum (which we do not account for in

However, modeling cycles
in time series data is challenging because in most cases the cycles are not
labeled or directly observed and need to be inferred from multidimensional
measurements taken over time. Here, we present CyHMMs, a cyclic hidden Markov
model method for detecting and modeling cycles in a collection of
multidimensional heterogeneous time series data. In contrast to previous cycle
modeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in
modeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete and
continuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data;
and they can share information across individuals to model variation both
within and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths
more accurately than existing methods, with 58% lower error on simulated data
and 63% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing
baseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can
model the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the
cycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series
into groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world
health-tracking datasets -- of menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity
tracking data -- yields important insights including which symptoms to expect
at each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several
groups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along
dimensions not provided to the model. For example, by modeling missing data in
the menstrual cycles dataset, we are able to discover a medically relevant
group of birth control users even though information on birth control is not
given to the model.

achieved by performing degenerate Raman cooling, and the atomic temperature is
inferred from the analysis of heterodyne fluorescence spectroscopy signals. Our
cooling method can be implemented either with externally applied or guided

occur for strongly confined guided optical fields. Thus, this method can be
implemented in any trap based on nanophotonic structures. Our results provide

determine the probability of a phonon specularly reflecting or diffusely
scattering from the rough surface of a material. The validity of Ziman's theory
as extended to solid/solid interfaces has not been previously validated. To
better understand the interfacial scattering of phonons and to test the
validity of Ziman's theory, we precisely measured the in-plane thermal

time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) for a Si film thickness range of 1 - 10

Ziman's theory. Calculations using Ziman's specularity parameter significantly
overestimate values from the TDTR measurements. We attribute this discrepancy
to phonon transmission through the solid/solid interface into the substrate,
which is not accounted for by Ziman's theory for surfaces. We derive a simple
expression for the specularity parameter at solid/amorphous interfaces and

high-resolution and high-cadence line-of-sight or vector magnetograms -- which
we obtain from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics

assumptions. We show that the free parameters of these assumptions can be
optimized to reproduce the time evolution of the total magnetic energy
injection through the photosphere in NOAA AR 11158, when compared to the recent
estimates for this active region. However, we find that the relative magnetic
helicity injection is reproduced poorly reaching at best a modest
underestimation. We discuss also the effect of some of the data processing
details on the results, including the masking of the noise-dominated pixels and
the tracking method of the active region, both of which have not received much
attention in the literature so far. In most cases the effect of these details
is small, but when the optimization of the free parameters of the ad hoc
assumptions is considered a consistent use of the noise mask is required. The
results found in this paper imply that the data processing and electric field
inversion approach that uses only the photospheric magnetic field information
offers a flexible and straightforward way to obtain photospheric magnetic and

Importantly, these maps are always time-translational invariant and allow for a
much simpler quantification of non-Markovianity compared to previous

quantifier is valid beyond linear response and can be expressed analytically.

equal to W[1], and is generally regarded as the parameterized counterpart to P
!= NP. We revisit the issue of the plausibility of FPT != W[1], focusing on two
aspects: the difficulty of proving the conjecture (assuming it holds), and how
the relation between the two classes might differ from the one between P and
NP.
  Regarding the first aspect, we give new evidence that separating FPT from
W[1] would be considerably harder than doing the same for P and NP. Our main
result regarding the relation between FPT and W[1] states that the closure of
W[1] under relativization with FPT-oracles is precisely the class W[P],
implying that either FPT is not low for W[1], or the W-Hierarchy collapses.
This theorem also has consequences for the A-Hierarchy (a parameterized version
of the Polynomial Hierarchy), namely that unless W[P] is a subset of some level
A[t], there are structural differences between the A-Hierarchy and the
Polynomial Hierarchy. We also prove that under the unlikely assumption that
W[P] collapses to W[1] in a specific way, the collapse of any two consecutive
levels of the A-Hierarchy implies the collapse of the entire hierarchy to a
finite level; this extends a result of Chen, Flum, and Grohe (2005).
  Finally, we give weak (oracle-based) evidence that the inclusion of W[t] in
A[t] is strict for t>1, and that the W-Hierarchy is proper. The latter result
answers a question of Downey and Fellows (1993).

as a measure of bending tendency in the linear response regime. Using instead
$\Delta E$ to characterize the bending response of the helical chain we
identify two regimes with qualitatively different bending behaviors for the
ground state configuration: the regime of small and the regime of large
radius-to-pitch ratio, respectively. Within the former regime, $\Delta E$
changes smoothly with the variation of the system parameters. Of particular
interest are its oscillations with the number of charged particles encountered
for commensurate fillings which yield length-dependent oscillations in the
preferred bending direction of the helical chain. We show that the origin of
these oscillations is the non-uniformity of the charge distribution caused by
the long-range character of the Coulomb interactions and the finite length of
the helix. In the second regime of large values of the radius-to-pitch ratio,
sudden changes in the ground state structure of the charges occur as the system
parameters vary, leading to complex and discontinuous variations in the ground

decipher behavioural rules that sheep follow at the individual scale in order

and moving mode at walking speed, so cohesive motion stems from synchronising
when they decide to switch between the two modes. We propose a model for the
individual decision making process, based on switching rates between stopped /
walking states that depend on behind / ahead locations and states of the
others. We parametrize this model from data. Next, we translate this
(microscopic) individual-based model into its density-flow (macroscopic)
equations counterpart. Numerical solving these equations display a traveling
pulse propagating at constant speed even though each individual is at any
moment either stopped or walking. Considering the minimal model embedded in
these equations, we derive analytically the steady shape of the pulse (sech
square). The parameters of the pulse (shape and speed) are expressed as
functions of individual parameters. This pulse emerges from the non linear
coupling of start/stop individual decisions which compensate exactly for
diffusion and promotes a steady ratio of walking / stopped individuals, which
in turn determines the traveling speed of the pulse. The system seems to
converge to this pulse from any initial condition, and to recover the pulse
after perturbation. This gives a high robustness to this coordination
mechanism.

space weather applications. Our previous studies have shown the importance of
sunspot number variability in the declining phase of the current 11-year
sunspot cycle to predict the strength of the next cycle when the minimum of the
current cycle has been observed. In this study we continue this approach and
show that we can remove the limitation of having to know the minimum epoch of
the current cycle, and that we can already provide a forecast of the following
cycle strength in the early stage of the declining phase of the current cycle.
We introduce a method to reliably calculate sunspot number second differences
(SNSD) in order to quantify the short-term variations of sunspot activity. We
demonstrate a steady relationship between the SNSD dynamics in the early stage
of the declining phase of a given cycle and the strength of the following
sunspot cycle. This finding may bear physical implications on the underlying
dynamo at work. From this relation, a relevant indicator is constructed that
distinguishes whether the next cycle will be stronger or weaker compared to the
current one. We demonstrate that within 24-31 months after reaching the maximum
of the cycle, it can be decided with high probability (0.96) whether the next
cycle will be weaker or stronger. We predict that sunspot cycle 25 will be
weaker than the current cycle 24.

absorbing phase transitions from two different approaches, both based on
numerical validations. On one hand, we numerically study a probability
distribution of duration/length of intervals of local inactive state in
quasi-steady state, which has been very commonly used in experiments, in a case
of the contact process. We show that the distributions obey the universal
scaling ansatz expected from phenomenological scaling argument, but that care
must be taken in order to suppress a bias caused by censoring due to a finite
observation window. To demonstrate the latter point, we compare the
distributions for the temporal intervals estimated through conventional
histograms with those through the estimator which properly takes account of
censoring and sampling bias. On the other hand, we also propose that, if a
system is subject to uniform advection as is often the case with flowing
systems, a correlation length and a correlation time near the transition point
can be easily quantified by supplying the system with an active boundary
condition. In order to support our proposal, we introduce a new model whose
advection strength can be arbitrarily controlled. The results of numerical
simulations on our model suggest that a correlation time, which is difficult to
measure through the interval distributions without the aforementioned bias, can
be measured through characteristic decay length of an order parameter.
Crossovers between two different power-law behaviors are also identified in
this case, and the universal scaling ans\""{a}tze associated with the crossovers
are discussed.

exacerbated on mobile devices due to their narrow apertures and small sensors.
One strategy for mitigating noise in a low-light situation is to increase the
shutter time of the camera, thus allowing each photosite to integrate more
light and decrease noise variance. However, there are two downsides of long
exposures: (a) bright regions can exceed the sensor range, and (b) camera and
scene motion will result in blurred images. Another way of gathering more light
is to capture multiple short (thus noisy) frames in a ""burst"" and intelligently
integrate the content, thus avoiding the above downsides. In this paper, we use
the burst-capture strategy and implement the intelligent integration via a
recurrent fully convolutional deep neural net (CNN). We build our novel,
multiframe architecture to be a simple addition to any single frame denoising
model, and design to handle an arbitrary number of noisy input frames. We show
that it achieves state of the art denoising results on our burst dataset,
improving on the best published multi-frame techniques, such as VBM4D and
FlexISP. Finally, we explore other applications of image enhancement by
integrating content from multiple frames and demonstrate that our DNN

pre-thermalization in this model, showing that the quench dynamics of the

in the model, starting from an inhomogeneous state with two domain walls which
separate regions characterised by spins with opposite transverse magnetization.
We observe at intermediate time scales a phenomenology akin to Anderson
localization: energy remains localised within the two domain walls, until the
Markovian noise destroys coherence and accordingly disorder-induced
localization, allowing the system to relax towards the late stages of its
non-equilibrium dynamics. We benchmark our results with the simpler case of a
noisy quantum Ising chain without disorder, and we find that the pre-thermal
plateau is a generic property of weakly noisy spin chains, while the phenomenon
of pre-thermal Anderson localisation is a specific feature arising from the
competition of noise and disorder in the real-time transport properties of the

centrally extended Poincar\'e algebra. We show that the bulk is described by a
novel non-Lorentzian geometry that we refer to as pseudo-Newton-Cartan

entire phase space of asymptotically AdS$_3$ spacetimes are well-behaved in the

With this choice, the resulting Newton-Cartan foliation structure is now
associated not with time, but with the emerging holographic direction. Since
the leaves of this foliation do not mix, the emergence of the holographic
direction is much simpler than in AdS$_3$ holography. Furthermore, we show that

research directions, especially on the analysis of facial texture images. In
particular, texture does not suffer any more from warping effects (that

images are commonly captured in arbitrary recording conditions, a considerable
amount of missing information and gross outliers is observed (e.g., due to

the sensitivity of the top-quark mass, determined by means of a few observables
already proposed in the literature as well as some new proposals, to the
relevant parameters of event generators, such as HERWIG 6 and PYTHIA 8. We find
that constraining those parameters at $\mathcal{O}(1\%-10\%)$ is required to
avoid a Monte Carlo uncertainty on $m_t$ greater than 500 MeV. For the sake of
achieving the needed accuracy on such parameters, we examine the sensitivity of
the top-quark mass measured from spectral features, such as peaks, endpoints
and distributions of $E_{B}$, $m_{B\ell}$, and some $m_{T2}$-like variables. We
find that restricting oneself to regions sufficiently close to the endpoints
enables one to substantially decrease the dependence on the Monte Carlo

uncertainties. To ameliorate this situation we study how well the data on
top-quark production and decay at the LHC can be utilized to constrain the

3$\sigma$ away from the SM value. We proposed that this anomaly may be
explained by the existence of a new $U(1)_D$ gauge boson, which couples with
opposite charges to the right-handed components of the bottom and charm quarks.
Cancellation of gauge anomalies demands the presence of a vector-like singlet
charged lepton as well as a neutral Dirac (or Majorana) particle that provides
a Dark Matter candidate. Constraints from precision measurements imply that the
mass of the new gauge boson should be around $115$~GeV. We discuss the

embedded into a $SU(3)_1\times SU(3)_2 \times SU(3)_3$ gauge group, with each
generation of quarks charged under the respective $SU(3)$. The non-zero value
of the up-quark Yukawa coupling (along with the strange quark and bottom-quark
Yukawas) is generated by contributions from small instantons at a new scale $M
\gg \Lambda_{QCD}$. The Higgsing of $SU(3)^3\to SU(3)_c$ allows dimension-5
operators that generate the Standard Model flavor structure and can be
completed in a simple renormalizable theory. The smallness of the third
generation mixing angles can naturally emerge in this picture, and is connected
to the smallness of threshold corrections to $\bar\theta$. Remarkably,
$\bar\theta$ is essentially fixed by the measured quark masses and mixings, and
is estimated to be close to the current experimental bound and well within
reach of the next generation of neutron and proton EDM experiments.

efficient supernova feedback is a necessary condition to create paths through

investigate the possibility that accreting supermassive black holes in early
dwarf galaxies may provide additional feedback and enhance the leakage of
ionizing radiation. We use a series of high resolution cosmological radiation
hydrodynamics simulations where we isolate the different sources of feedback.
We find that supernova feedback prevents the growth of the black hole, thus
quenching its associated feedback. Even in cases where the black hole can grow,
the structure of the interstellar medium is strongly dominated by supernova
feedback. We conclude that, in the dwarf galaxy regime, supermassive black
holes do not appear to play a significant role in enhancing the escape fraction

agreement with integrated-light observations if we mimic observational methods

in stellar mass . However, these observational methods systematically
underestimate the accreted stellar component, defined in our (and most)

factor of ten, since the accreted component is centrally concentrated and
therefore substantially obscured by the galactic disk. Furthermore, these
observational methods introduce spurious dependencies of the estimated accreted
stellar component on the stellar mass and size of galaxies that can obscure the
trends in accreted stellar mass predicted by cosmological simulations, since we
find that in our simulations the size and shape of the central galaxy is not
strongly correlated with the assembly history of the accreted stellar halo.
This effect persists whether galaxies are viewed edge-on or face-on. We show
that metallicity or color information may provide a way to more cleanly
delineate in observations the regions dominated by accreted stars. Absent
additional data, we caution that estimates of the mass of the accreted stellar

and mass ratio and the GC orbit, we show that the reciprocal feedback exerted
between GCs and the BHB shapes their global properties. We show that, at
GC-to-BHB mass ratios above 0.1, the GC affects notably the BHB orbital
evolution, possibly boosting its coalescence. This effect is maximized if the
GC moves on a retrograde orbit, and for a non-equal mass BHB. We show that the
GC debris dispersed around the galactic nucleus can lead to the formation of a
nuclear cluster, depending on the BHB tidal field, and that the distribution of
compact remnants resulting from the GC disruption can carry information about
the BHB orbital properties. We find that red giant stars delivered by the

these numbers may well depend on the details of the physical models implemented

Consequently, it would be expected to have an unnatural (positive) parity
ground state similar to $^{11}$Be and $^{10}$Li. Despite many experimental and
theoretical investigations, its structure remains uncertain. Apart from the
fact that it is unbound, other properties including the spin and parity of its
ground state and the very existence of additional low-lying resonances are
still a matter of debate. In this work we study the properties of $^9$He by
analyzing the $n+^8$He continuum in the context of the ab initio no-core shell
model with continuum (NCSMC) formalism with chiral interactions as the only
input. The NCSMC is a state-of-the-art approach for the ab initio description
of light nuclei. With its capability to predict properties of bound states,
resonances, and scattering states in a unified framework, the method is
particularly well suited for the study of unbound nuclei such as $^9$He. Our
analysis produces an unbound $^9$He nucleus. Two resonant states are found at
the energies of ${\sim}1$ and ${\sim}3.5$ MeV, respectively, above the $n+^8$He
breakup threshold. The first state has a spin-parity assignment of $J^{\pi} =
{1/2}^-$ and can be associated with the ground state of $^9$He, while the
second, broader state has a spin-parity of ${3/2}^-$. No resonance is found in
the ${1/2}^+$ channel, only a very weak attraction. We find that the $^9$He
ground-state resonance has a negative parity and thus breaks the
parity-inversion mechanism found in the $^{11}$Be and $^{10}$Li nuclei of the

numerical method is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental
results from literature. The numerical and experimental results reach a good

horizontal concentric cylindrical annulus with Rayleigh number in the range of
10^2 to 10^7 and Prandtl number in the range of 0.01 to 10. In general, the
flow is stable at low Rayleigh number but unstable at high Rayleigh number. The
transition Rayleigh number from stable to unstable states is lower in the low
Prandtl number cases than in the high Prandtl number cases. Four different

type galaxies (ETGs) are expected to have different physical properties from
those of the galaxies' central regions. This work aims at characterizing the
kinematic properties of ETG halos using planetary nebulae (PNe) as tracers,
which allow us to overcome the limitations of absorption line spectroscopy of
continuum at low surface brightness. We present two-dimensional velocity and
velocity dispersion fields for 33 ETGs, including both fast (FRs) and slow
rotators (SRs), making this the largest kinematic survey to-date of
extragalactic PNe. The velocity fields extend out to a median 5.6 effective
radii (Re), with a range [3Re-13Re] for the PN.S ETGs. We complemented the PN
kinematics with absorption line data from the literature. We find that ETGs
typically show a kinematic transition between inner regions and halo. Estimated
transition radii in units of Re anticorrelate with stellar mass. SRs have
increased but still modest rotational support at large radii, while most of the
FRs show a decrease in rotation, due to the fading of the stellar disk in the
outer, more slowly rotating spheroid. 30% of the FRs are dominated by rotation
also at large radii. Most ETGs have flat or slightly falling halo velocity
dispersion profiles, but 15% of the sample have steeply falling profiles. 40%
of the FRs show kinematic twists, misalignments, or rotation along two axes,
indicating that they turn from oblate at the center to triaxial in the halo,
consistently with the distribution of isophote twists from extended photometry.
ETGs have more diverse kinematic properties in their halos than in the central
regions. The observed kinematic transition to the halo and its dependence on
stellar mass is consistent with LambdaCDM simulations and supports a two-phase
formation scenario. [abridged]

endpoint conditional on a post-randomization quantity in a counterfactual world
in which all subjects received treatment. It is generally difficult to identify
this parameter without strong, untestable assumptions. It has been shown that
identifiability assumptions become much weaker under a crossover design in
which subjects not receiving treatment are later given treatment. Under the
assumption that the post-treatment biomarker observed in these crossover
subjects is the same as would have been observed had they received treatment at
the start of the study, one can identify the treatment effect with only mild
additional assumptions. This remains true if the endpoint is absorbent, i.e. an
endpoint such as death or HIV infection such that the post-crossover treatment
biomarker is not meaningful if the endpoint has already occurred. In this work,
we review identifiability results for a parameter of the distribution of the
data observed under a crossover design with the principally stratified
treatment effect of interest. We describe situations in which these assumptions
would be falsifiable, and show that these assumptions are not otherwise
falsifiable. We then provide a targeted minimum loss-based estimator for the
setting that makes no assumptions on the distribution that generated the data.
When the semiparametric efficiency bound is well defined, for which the primary
condition is that the biomarker is discrete-valued, this estimator is efficient
among all regular and asymptotically linear estimators. We also present a
version of this estimator for situations in which the biomarker is continuous.
Implications to closeout designs for vaccine trials are discussed.

numerically simulated two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder for
Reynolds numbers in the range $50\le Re\le300$; here, $Re = U_{\infty}D/\nu$
with $U_\infty$, $D$ and $\nu$ being the free-stream velocity, the diameter of
the cylinder and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, respectively. For a
given $Re$, inviscid local stability equations from the geometric optics
approach are solved on three distinct closed fluid particle trajectories
(denoted as orbits 1, 2 & 3) for purely transverse perturbations. The inviscid
instability on orbits 1 & 2, which are symmetric counterparts of one another,
is shown to undergo bifurcations at $Re\approx50$ and $Re\approx250$. Upon
incorporating finite-wavenumber, finite-Reynolds number effects to compute
corrected local instability growth rates, the inviscid instability on orbits 1
& 2 is shown to be suppressed for $Re\lesssim262$. Orbits 1 & 2 are thus shown
to exhibit a synchronous instability for $Re\gtrsim262$, which is remarkably
close to the critical Reynolds number for the mode-B secondary instability.
Further evidence for the connection between the local instability on orbits 1 &
2, and the mode-B secondary instability, is provided via a comparison of the
growth rate variation with span-wise wavenumber between the local and global
stability approaches. In summary, our results strongly suggest that the
three-dimensional short-wavelength instability on orbits 1 & 2 is a possible
mechanism for the emergence of the mode B secondary instability.

the adhesive contact problem under the so-called JKR regime. The derivation is
based on generalizing the original JKR energetic derivation assuming
calculation of the strain energy in adhesiveless contact, and unloading at
constant contact area. The underlying assumption is that the contact area
distributions are the same as under adhesiveless conditions (for an
appropriately increased normal load), so that in general the stress intensity
factors will not be exactly equal at all contact edges. The solution is simply
that the indentation is D=D1-Sqrt(2w A'/P"") where w is surface energy, D1 is
the adhesiveless indentation, A' is the first derivative of contact area and P""
the second derivative of the load with respect to indentation. The solution
only requires macroscopic quantities, and not very elaborate local
distributions, and is exact in many configurations like axisymmetric contacts.
It permits also an estimate of the full solution for elastic rough solids with
Gaussian multiple scales of roughness, which so far was lacking, using known
adhesiveless simple results. The solution turns out to depend only on rms
amplitude and slopes of the surface, and in the fractal limit, slopes would
grow without limit, tends to the adhesiveless result - although in this limit
the JKR model is inappropriate. However, a more solid result is that the
solution would also go to adhesiveless result for large rms amplitude of
roughness h_{rms}, irrespective of the small scale details, and in agreement
with common sense and previous models by the author.

data for each sample unit corresponds to a series of gap times between the
subsequent events. Given a limited follow-up period, the last gap time might be
right-censored. In contrast to classical analysis, gap times and censoring
times cannot be assumed independent, i.e. the sequential nature of the data
induces dependent censoring. Also, the recurrences typically vary between
sample units leading to unbalanced data. To model the association pattern
between gap times, so far only parametric margins combined with the restrictive
class of Archimedean copulas have been considered. Here, taking the specific
data features into account, we extend existing work in several directions: we
allow for nonparametric margins and consider the flexible class of D-vine
copulas. A global and sequential (one- and two-stage) likelihood approach are
suggested. We discuss the computational efficiency of each estimation strategy.
Extensive simulations show good finite sample performance of the proposed

equations in the presence of asymptotically at background geometry. Trapped

sufficiently weak, a logarithmic loss of regularity suffices. Here, by studying
a warped product manifold introduced by Christianson and Wunsch, we encounter
the first explicit example of a situation where an estimate with an algebraic

driven by two-body encounters. In many cases, the motion of the particles is
primarily governed by the mean field potential. When this potential is
integrable, particles move on nearly fixed orbits, which can be described in
terms of angle-action variables. The mean field potential drives fast orbital
motions (angles) whose associated orbits (actions) are adiabatically conserved
on short dynamical timescales. The long-term stochastic evolution of the
actions is driven by the potential fluctuations around the mean field and in

of two particles are in resonance. We show that the stochastic gravitational
fluctuations acting on the particles can generically be described by a
correlated Gaussian noise. Using this approach, the so-called $\eta$-formalism,
we derive a diffusion equation for the actions in the test particle limit. We
show that in the appropriate limits, this diffusion equation is equivalent to
the inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard and Landau equations. This approach provides a

Chemically Peculiar star. We have first compared the high resolution spectrum
of HR 8844 to that of four slow rotators near A0V ($\nu$ Cap, $\nu$ Cnc ,
Sirius A and HD 72660) to highlight similarities and differences. The lines of
Ti II, Cr II, Sr II and Ba II are conspicuous features in the high resolution
high signal-to-noise SOPHIE spectra of HR 8844 and much stronger than in the
spectra of the normal star $\nu$ Cap. The Hg II line at 3983.93 \AA\ is also
present in a 3.5 \% blend. Selected unblended lines of 31 chemical elements
from He up to Hg have been synthesized using model atmospheres computed with
ATLAS9 and the spectrum synthesis code SYNSPEC48 including hyperfine structure
of various isotopes when relevant. These synthetic spectra have been adjusted
to the mean SOPHIE spectrum of HR 8844, and high resolution spectra of the
comparison stars. Chisquares were minimized in order to derive abundances or
upper limits to the abundances of these elements for HR 8844 and the comparison
stars. HR 8844 is found to have underabundances of He, C, O, Mg, Ca and Sc,
mild enhancements of Ti, V, Cr, Mn and distinct enhancements of the heavy
elements Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Pr, Sm, Eu and Hg, the overabundances increasing
steadily with atomic number. This chemical pattern suggests that HR 8844 may
actually be a new transition object between the coolest HgMn stars and the Am
stars.

(among a finite number of locations) via a sequence of measurements, where each
measurement consists of simultaneously probing a group of locations. The
resulting observation consists of a sum of an indicator of the target's
presence in the probed region, and a zero mean Gaussian noise term whose
variance is a function of the measurement vector. An equivalence between the
target acquisition problem and channel coding over a binary input additive
white Gaussian noise (BAWGN) channel with state and feedback is established.
Utilizing this information theoretic perspective, a two-stage adaptive target
search strategy based on the sorted Posterior Matching channel coding strategy
is proposed. Furthermore, using information theoretic converses, the
fundamental limits on the target acquisition rate for adaptive and non-adaptive
strategies are characterized. As a corollary to the non-asymptotic upper bound
of the expected number of measurements under the proposed two-stage strategy,
and to non-asymptotic lower bound of the expected number of measurements for
optimal non-adaptive search strategy, a lower bound on the adaptivity gain is
obtained. The adaptivity gain is further investigated in different asymptotic
regimes of interest.

linear instabilities in Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices in homogeneous and
stratified environments. The base flow, generated using two-dimensional
numerical simulations, is characterized by the Reynolds number and the
Richardson number defined based on the initial one-dimensional velocity and
buoyancy profiles. The local stability equations are then solved on closed
streamlines in the vortical base flow, which is assumed quasi-steady. For the
unstratified case, the elliptic instability at the vortex core dominates at
early times, before being taken over by the hyperbolic instability at the
vortex edge. For the stratified case, the early time instabilities comprise a
dominant elliptic instability at the core and a hyperbolic instability strongly
influenced by stratification at the vortex edge. At intermediate times, the
local approach shows a new branch of instability (convective branch) that
emerges at the vortex core and subsequently moves towards the vortex edge. A
few more convective instability branches appear at the vortex core and move
away, before coalescing to form the most unstable region inside the vortex
periphery at large times. The dominant instability characteristics from the
local approach are shown to be in good qualitative agreement with results from
global instability studies for both homogeneous and stratified cases.
Compartmentalized analyses are then used to elucidate the role of shear and
stratification on the identified instabilities. The role of buoyancy is shown
to be critical after the primary KH instability saturates, with the dominant
convective instability shown to occur in regions with the strongest statically
unstable layering. We conclude by highlighting the potentially insightful role
that the local approach may offer in understanding the secondary instabilities
in other flows.

challenges in developing high performance energy devices, such as solid oxide
fuel cells. Straining a film by growing on a lattice-mismatched substrate has
been a conventional approach to enhance the ORR activity. However, due to the
limited choice of electrolyte substrates to alter the degree of strain, a
systematic study in various materials has been a challenge. Here, we explore
the strain modulation of the ORR kinetics by growing epitaxial
La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-{\delta} (LSCO) films on yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates
with the film thickness below and above the critical thickness for strain
relaxation. Two orders of magnitude higher ORR kinetics is achieved in an
ultra-thin film with ~0.8% tensile strain as compared to unstrained films.
Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling confirms that
the Sr surface segregation is not responsible for the enhanced ORR in strained
films. We attribute this enhancement of ORR kinetics to the increase in oxygen
vacancy concentration in the tensile-strained LSCO film owing to the reduced
activation barrier for oxygen surface exchange kinetics. Density functional
theory calculations reveal an upshift of the oxygen 2p-band center relative to
the Fermi level by tensile strain, indicating the origin of the enhanced ORR
kinetics.

performance using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), cameras, and nonlinear

However, many of these methods rely significantly on vision and often fail when
visual tracking is lost due to lighting or scarcity of features. This paper
presents a state-estimation technique for legged robots that takes into account
the robot's kinematic model as well as its contact with the environment. We
introduce forward kinematic factors and preintegrated contact factors into a
factor graph framework that can be incrementally solved in real-time. The
forward kinematic factor relates the robot's base pose to a contact frame
through noisy encoder measurements. The preintegrated contact factor provides
odometry measurements of this contact frame while accounting for possible foot
slippage. Together, the two developed factors constrain the graph optimization
problem allowing the robot's trajectory to be estimated. The paper evaluates
the method using simulated and real sensory IMU and kinematic data from
experiments with a Cassie-series robot designed by Agility Robotics. These
preliminary experiments show that using the proposed method in addition to IMU
decreases drift and improves localization accuracy, suggesting that its use can
enable successful recovery from a loss of visual tracking.

maximal resistance distance in $G_n$ occurs between vertices 1 and $n$ and the
minimal resistance distance occurs between vertices $n/2$ and $n/2+1$ for $n$
even (with a similar result for $n$ odd). It follows that $r_n(1,n) \to \infty$
as $n \to \infty$. Moreover, our explicit formula makes it possible to order
the non-edges of $G_n$ exactly according to resistance distance, and this
ordering agrees with the intuitive notion of distance on a graph. Consequently,
$G_n$ is a geometric graph with entirely different properties than the random
geometric graphs investigated in [6]. These results for straight linear 2-trees
along with an example of a bent linear 2-tree and empirical results for
additional graph classes convincingly demonstrate that resistance distance

wherein only a subset of the records in a database are sensitive, possibly
based on predefined privacy policies. Existing solutions, viz, differential
privacy (DP), are over-pessimistic and treat all information as sensitive.
Alternatively, techniques, like access control and personalized differential
privacy, reveal all non-sensitive records truthfully, and they indirectly leak
information about sensitive records through exclusion attacks.
  Motivated by the limitations of prior work, we introduce the notion of
one-sided differential privacy (OSDP). We formalize the exclusion attack and we
show how OSDP protects against it. OSDP offers differential privacy like
guarantees, but only to the sensitive records. OSDP allows the truthful release
of a subset of the non-sensitive records. The sample can be used to support
applications that must output true data, and is well suited for publishing
complex types of data, e.g. trajectories. Though some non-sensitive records are
suppressed to avoid exclusion attacks, our experiments show that the
suppression results in a small loss in utility in most cases. Additionally, we
present a recipe for turning DP mechanisms for answering counting queries into
OSDP techniques for the same task. Our OSDP algorithms leverage the presence of
non-sensitive records and are able to offer up to a 25x improvement in accuracy

results lead to an improved definition of fracton phase and bring to the fore

Upon femtosecond laser excitation, $5d6s$ electrons are directly excited, their

opposite. For the first time, our first-principles minority shift now agrees
with the experiment quantitatively. Excited $5d6s$ electrons lower the exchange

of advective balance, such that $\zeta \equiv \omega_\phi/r \approx F(\psi,

the dividing streamline. Here $\zeta \equiv\omega_\phi/r$ is the ratio of
azimuthal vorticity to cylindrical radius, and $\psi$ is the Stokes
streamfunction in the frame of the ring. Some but not all of the $\mathrm{Re}$
dependence in the time evolution of $F(\psi, t)$ can be captured by introducing
a scaled time $\tau = \nu t$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. When $\nu
t/D^2 \gtrsim 0.02$, the shape of $F(\psi)$ is dominated by the
linear-in-$\psi$ component, the coefficient of the quadratic term being an
order of magnitude smaller. An important feature is that as the dividing
streamline ($\psi = 0$) is approached, $F(\psi)$ tends to a non-zero intercept
which exhibits an extra $\mathrm{Re}$ dependence. This and other features are
explained by a simple toy model consisting of the one-dimensional cylindrical
diffusion equation. The key ingredient in the model responsible for the extra
$\mathrm{Re}$ dependence is a Robin-type boundary condition, similar to
Newton's law of cooling, that accounts for the edge layer at the dividing

the $\beta_\lambda$-function in that ratio, and it is of the expected
parametric form for the Boltzmann gas, while for the Bose-Einstein case it is
affected by the infrared cut-off. This suggests that the relaxation time
approximation may be too crude to obtain a reliable form of $\zeta/\tau_R$ for
gases obeying Bose-Einstein statistics.

crucially depends on the cost-benefit ratio of cooperation, denoted as $c$. In
this work, we investigate the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma for
various values of $c$ with four of the representative memory-one strategies,
i.e., unconditional cooperation, unconditional defection, tit-for-tat, and
win-stay-lose-shift. We consider replicator dynamics which deterministically
describes how the fraction of each strategy evolves over time in an
infinite-sized well-mixed population in the presence of implementation error
and mutation among the four strategies. Our finding is that this
three-dimensional continuous-time dynamics exhibits chaos through a bifurcation
sequence similar to that of a logistic map as $c$ varies. If mutation occurs
with rate $\mu \ll 1$, the position of the bifurcation sequence on the $c$ axis
is numerically found to scale as $\mu^{0.1}$, and such sensitivity to $\mu$
suggests that mutation may have non-perturbative effects on evolutionary paths.
It demonstrates how the microscopic randomness of the mutation process can be
amplified to macroscopic unpredictability by evolutionary dynamics.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parallel computing methods have been developed.
These methods partition large data sets by observations into subsets. However,

parallel Bayesian MCMC methods that take into account the structure of the

estimated independently in parallel. The stage 1 posteriors are used as
proposal distributions in stage 2, where the target distribution is the full

solution to address this challenge. Network slicing allows programmable network
instances which match the service requirements by using network virtualization
technologies. However, how to efficiently allocate resources across network
slices has not been well studied in the literature. Therefore, in this paper,
we first introduce a model for orchestrating network slices based on the

  Classification Models",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently researchers have proposed using deep learning-based systems for
malware detection. Unfortunately, all deep learning classification systems are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work has studied adversarial
attacks against static analysis-based malware classifiers which only classify
the content of the unknown file without execution. However, since the majority
of malware is either packed or encrypted, malware classification based on
static analysis often fails to detect these types of files. To overcome this
limitation, anti-malware companies typically perform dynamic analysis by
emulating each file in the anti-malware engine or performing in-depth scanning
in a virtual machine. These strategies allow the analysis of the malware after
unpacking or decryption. In this work, we study different strategies of
crafting adversarial samples for dynamic analysis. These strategies operate on
sparse, binary inputs in contrast to continuous inputs such as pixels in
images. We then study the effects of two, previously proposed defensive
mechanisms against crafted adversarial samples including the distillation and
ensemble defenses. We also propose and evaluate the weight decay defense.
Experiments show that with these three defensive strategies, the number of
successfully crafted adversarial samples is reduced compared to a standard
baseline system without any defenses. In particular, the ensemble defense is
the most resilient to adversarial attacks. Importantly, none of the defenses
significantly reduce the classification accuracy for detecting malware.
Finally, we demonstrate that while adding additional hidden layers to neural
models does not significantly improve the malware classification accuracy, it
does significantly increase the classifier's robustness to adversarial attacks.

These methods are then extended to encompass supersymmetric abelian and
non-abelian gauge theories coupled to supermatter. Since supersymmetry is not
an exact symmetry of nature, it must ultimately be broken. We discuss several
mechanisms of SUSY-breaking (both spontaneous and explicit) and briefly survey
various proposals for realizing SUSY-breaking in nature. Finally, we construct
the the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), and
consider the implications for the future of SUSY in particle physics.

image from a single low resolution image. The SISR task has been a very
attractive research topic over the last two decades. In recent years,
convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have achieved great performance
on SISR task. Despite the breakthroughs achieved by using CNN models, there are
still some problems remaining unsolved, such as how to recover high frequency
details of high resolution images. Previous CNN based models always use a pixel
wise loss, such as l2 loss. Although the high resolution images constructed by
these models have high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), they often tend to be
blurry and lack high-frequency details, especially at a large scaling factor.
In this paper, we build a super resolution perceptual generative adversarial
network (SRPGAN) framework for SISR tasks. In the framework, we propose a
robust perceptual loss based on the discriminator of the built SRPGAN model. We
use the Charbonnier loss function to build the content loss and combine it with
the proposed perceptual loss and the adversarial loss. Compared with other
state-of-the-art methods, our method has demonstrated great ability to
construct images with sharp edges and rich details. We also evaluate our method
on different benchmarks and compare it with previous CNN based methods. The
results show that our method can achieve much higher structural similarity
index (SSIM) scores on most of the benchmarks than the previous state-of-art
methods.

are then often employed, which results in performance loss. Therefore, the
conventional methods of resource allocation are facing great challenges to meet
the ever-increasing QoS requirements of users with scarce radio resource.
Assisted by cloud computing, a huge amount of historical data on scenarios can
be collected for extracting similarities among scenarios using machine
learning. Moreover, optimal or near-optimal solutions of historical scenarios
can be searched offline and stored in advance. When the measured data of
current scenario arrives, the current scenario is compared with historical
scenarios to find the most similar one. Then, the optimal or near-optimal
solution in the most similar historical scenario is adopted to allocate the
radio resources for the current scenario. To facilitate the application of new

using characteristic frequencies corresponding to the onset of conductance

stress-independent universality. In order to model this electrical transport, a
contact network is constructed on the basis of prescribed packing structures,

color component of the non-Abelian electric field $E^a$ is squeezed by the
corresponding color component of the solenoidal current $J^a_{\mu}$. Then only
the color singlets alone can survive as a physical state and non-Abelian color
confinement is realized.
  Numerical studies are done in the framework of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory.
We adopt an Abelian-like definition of monopole following DeGrand-Toussaint as
a lattice version of VNABI. To reduce severe lattice artifacts, we introduce
various techniques of smoothing the thermalized vacuum such as the maximal
center gauge (MCG) fixing. We measure the density
$\rho(a(\beta),n)=\sqrt{(k_n^1)^2+(k_n^2)^2+(k_n^3)^2}/(4\sqrt{4}Vb^3)$, where
$k_n^a$ is an $n$ blocked monopole in the color direction $a$ and $b=na(\beta)$
is the blocked lattice spacing. Beautiful scaling behaviors are seen when we
plot $\rho(a(\beta),n)$ versus $b=na(\beta)$. A single universal curve
$\rho(b)$ is found from $n=1\sim 12$, which suggests that $\rho(a(\beta),n)$ is
a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone. The universal curve seems independent of a
gauge fixing procedure used to smooth the lattice vacuum when the scaling is
obtained. The scaling shows that the lattice definition of VNABI has the
continuum limit.

noncommutative geometry looking around its spectral approach. Strongly
motivated by physics, in particular by relativity and quantum mechanics,
Chamseddine and Connes have defined an action based on spectral considerations,
the so-called spectral action.
  The idea is to review the necessary tools which are behind this spectral
action to be able to compute it first in the case of Riemannian manifolds
(Einstein--Hilbert action). Then, all primary objects defined for manifolds
will be generalized to reach the level of noncommutative geometry via spectral
triples, with the concrete analysis of the noncommutative torus which is a
deformation of the ordinary one.
  The basics of different ingredients will be presented and studied like, Dirac
operators, heat equation asymptotics, zeta functions and then, how to get
within the framework of operators on Hilbert spaces, the notion of
noncommutative residue, Dixmier trace, pseudodifferential operators etc. These
notions are appropriate in noncommutative geometry to tackle the case where the
space is swapped with an algebra like for instance the noncommutative torus.
Its non-compact generalization, namely the Moyal plane, is also investigated.

transmitters and receivers, whereby each transmitter has a cache memory of
finite size. Each transmitter fills its cache memory from a content library of

requests one of the library files, and the transmitters are responsible for
delivering the requested files from their caches to the receivers. The
objective is to design schemes for the placement and delivery phases to
maximize the sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) which expresses the capacity of
the interference network at the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Our work
mainly focuses on a commonly used uncoded placement strategy. We provide an
information-theoretic bound on the sum-DoF for this placement strategy. We
demonstrate by an example that the derived bound is tighter than the bounds
existing in the literature for small cache sizes. We propose a novel delivery
scheme with a higher achievable sum-DoF than those previously given in the
literature. The results reveal that the reciprocal of sum-DoF decreases
linearly as the transmitter cache size increases. Therefore, increasing cache
sizes at transmitters translates to increasing the sum-DoF and, hence, the

empirical data and mathematical models. Models of cultural dynamics aim at
explaining the emergence of culturally homogeneous groups through social
influence. Traditionally, the initial cultural traits of individuals are chosen
uniformly at random, the emphasis being on characterizing the model outcomes
that are independent of these (`annealed') initial conditions. Here, motivated
by an increasing interest in forecasting social behavior in the real world, we
reverse the point of view and focus on the effect of specific (`quenched')
initial conditions, including those obtained from real data, on the final
cultural state. We study the predictability, rigorously defined in an
information-theoretic sense, of the \emph{social content} of the final cultural
groups (i.e. who ends up in which group) from the knowledge of the initial
cultural traits. We find that, as compared to random and shuffled initial
conditions, the hierarchical ultrametric-like organization of empirical
cultural states significantly increases the predictability of the final social
content by largely confining cultural convergence within the lower levels of
the hierarchy. Moreover, predictability correlates with the compatibility of
short-term social coordination and long-term cultural diversity, a property
that has been recently found to be strong and robust in empirical data. We also
introduce a null model generating initial conditions that retain the
ultrametric representation of real data. Using this ultrametric model,
predictability is highly enhanced with respect to the random and shuffled
cases, confirming the usefulness of the empirical hierarchical organization of
culture for forecasting the outcome of social influence models.

pulsars. Theoretically, when the the GW frequencies from a distorted pulsar are
twice the frequencies of EM pulses, they should be emitted at the same time. By
measuring the arrival times of these two signals emitted at the same time, the
speed of GWs can be calculated with the time difference. Specifically, when the
glitches of pulsars are taken into consideration, some pulsars in our Galaxy
and nearby galaxies are potential to test our new strategy at high accuracy in
the foreseeable future. On the other hand, the new method is meaningful as a
motivation for future design of instruments.

variety of ways, including two point correlation functions (TPCFs) that are
power laws for spatial scales up to at least several hundred parsecs. As the
stars age, this power law decreases in slope until it becomes nearly flat at
~100 Myr, at which point the hierarchical structure has disappeared. The fact
that the TPCF remains nearly a power law during this time implies that the
dispersal mechanism is somewhat independent of scale. This rules out dispersal
by random stellar motions at either the local gas turbulent speed or a constant
speed, because in both cases the hierarchy would disappear at small scales
first, causing the TPCF to bend over. Destruction by shear has the right
property as the shear rate in a galaxy is independent of scale for kpc-size
regions, but shear converts the hierarchy into an azimuthal stream which still
has a power-law TPCF. What does explain the observation is the overlapping of
several independent hierarchies from successive generations of star formation
in the same region. If stellar age is determined from magnitude intervals on
the main sequence of a color-magnitude diagram, or if clusters ages are grouped
together logarithmically into bins, then multiple generations will overlap more
and more as the grouped populations age, and this overlap will lower the
spatial correlations between group members. Models of these processes
illustrate their relative roles in removing the appearance of young stellar
hierarchies.

  Compress Image","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although deep convolutional neural network has been proved to efficiently
eliminate coding artifacts caused by the coarse quantization of traditional
codec, it's difficult to train any neural network in front of the encoder for
gradient's back-propagation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end image
compression framework based on convolutional neural network to resolve the
problem of non-differentiability of the quantization function in the standard
codec. First, the feature description neural network is used to get a valid
description in the low-dimension space with respect to the ground-truth image
so that the amount of image data is greatly reduced for storage or
transmission. After image's valid description, standard image codec such as
JPEG is leveraged to further compress image, which leads to image's great
distortion and compression artifacts, especially blocking artifacts, detail
missing, blurring, and ringing artifacts. Then, we use a post-processing neural
network to remove these artifacts. Due to the challenge of directly learning a
non-linear function for a standard codec based on convolutional neural network,
we propose to learn a virtual codec neural network to approximate the
projection from the valid description image to the post-processed compressed
image, so that the gradient could be efficiently back-propagated from the
post-processing neural network to the feature description neural network during
training. Meanwhile, an advanced learning algorithm is proposed to train our
deep neural networks for compression. Obviously, the priority of the proposed
method is compatible with standard existing codecs and our learning strategy
can be easily extended into these codecs based on convolutional neural network.
Experimental results have demonstrated the advances of the proposed method as
compared to several state-of-the-art approaches, especially at very low
bit-rate.

I/Q imbalance is caused by amplitude and phase mismatch between I/Q paths. The
performance degradation resulting from I/Q imbalance can not be mitigated with
simply higher signal to noise ratio (SNR). Thus, I/Q imbalance compensation in
the digital domain is critical. There are two main contributions in this paper.
Firstly, we proposed a blind estimation algorithm for I/Q imbalance parameters
based on joint first and second order statistics (FSS) which has lower
complexity than conventional Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation (GMLE).
This can be used for further processing such as equalization in the presence of
receiver IQ imbalance. In addition, we find out the reason of the error floor
in conventional I/Q imbalance compensation method based on the conjugate signal

other standard datasets for which no retraining was done. We show that our

explored. It is shown that the (1+1)-dimensional rogue waves in nonlocal NLS

It is also shown that the (1+2)-dimensional line rogue waves in the nonlocal DS
equations can be bounded for all space and time, or have finite-time
blowing-ups. All these types depend on the values of free parameters introduced
in the solution. In addition, the dynamics patterns in the multi- and

Furthermore, we find $B_0<0.0045$ and $|w+1|<0.002$ (95\%CL) for the designer

the fact that generic $f(\mathcal{R})$ models with $w\neq-1$ can be tightly
constrained by current cosmological data, complementary to solar system tests
(Brax et al. 2008, Faulkner et al. 2007). When compared to a $w$CDM fluid with

by modeling groups of slowness pixels from discrete slowness maps, called
patches, as sparse linear combinations of atoms from a dictionary. We propose
to use dictionary learning during the inversion to adapt dictionaries to
specific slowness maps. This patch regularization, called the local model, is
integrated into the overall slowness map, called the global model. The local
model considers small-scale variations using a sparsity constraint and the
global model considers larger-scale features constrained using $\ell_2$
regularization. This strategy in a locally-sparse travel time tomography (LST)
approach enables simultaneous modeling of smooth and discontinuous slowness
features. This is in contrast to conventional tomography methods, which
constrain models to be exclusively smooth or discontinuous. We develop a
$\textit{maximum a posteriori}$ formulation for LST and exploit the sparsity of
slowness patches using dictionary learning. The LST approach compares favorably
with smoothness and total variation regularization methods on densely, but
irregularly sampled synthetic slowness maps.

many applications. This paper describes a numerical method, based on smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH), for simulating n-heptane drop impact on a heated
surface. The SPH method uses numerical Lagrangian particles, which obey the
laws of fluid dynamics, to describe the fluid flows. By incorporating the
Peng-Robinson equation of state, the present SPH method can directly simulate
both the liquid and vapor phases and the phase change process between them. The
numerical method was validated by two experiments on drop impact on heated
surfaces at low impact velocities. The numerical method was then used to
predict drop-wall interactions at various temperatures and velocities. The
model was able to predict the different outcomes, such as rebound, spread,
splash, breakup, and the Leidenfrost phenomenon, consistent with the physical
understanding.

superposition principle result in the $SL(2, {\bf C})$-symmetry of quantum
states. The role of Pauli's exclusion principle in the derivation of the SL(2,
C) symmetry is put forward as the source of the macroscopically observed
Lorentz symmetry, then it is generalized for the case of the Z3 grading
replacing the usual Z2 grading, leading to ternary commutation relations. We
discuss the cubic and ternary generalizations of Grassmann algebra. Invariant
cubic forms are introduced, and their symmetry group is shown to be the
$SL(2,C)$ group The wave equation generalizing the Dirac operator to the
Z3-graded case is constructed. Its diagonalization leads to a sixth-order
equation. The solutions cannot propagate because their exponents always contain
non-oscillating real damping factor. We show how certain cubic products can
propagate nevertheless. The model suggests the origin of the color SU(3)
symmetry.

architectures to achieve superior performance to convolution based neural

requiring dramatically less training examples to achieve high prediction
accuracy ($>98\%$). The advantages of our proposed method is demonstrated in
results on benchmark datasets which show significant performance gain over
existing state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. By Fourier
transforming the inputs, each point in the training sample then has a
representational energy of all the weighted information from every other point.
The consequence of using this input is a reduced complexity neuron network,
reduced computation load and the lifting of the requirement for a large number
of training examples to achieve high classification accuracy.

  particle nearby a planar rigid wall","10 pages","Physics Open Vol. 4, art. no. 100029 (2020) (14 pages)","10.1016/j.physo.2020.100029",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents an analytical formalism for the modal series expansions of
the acoustic radiation force and radiation torque experienced by a fluid
viscous cylindrical object of arbitrary geometrical cross-section placed near a
planar rigid wall. A plane progressive wave field with an arbitrary angle of
incidence propagating in an inviscid fluid is assumed. Initially, an effective
field incident on the particle (including the principal incident field, the
reflected wave-field from the boundary and the scattered field from the image
object) is defined. Subsequently, the incident effective field is utilized in
conjunction with the scattered one from the object, to obtain closed-form
expansions for the longitudinal and transversal force components, in addition
to the axial torque component, based on the scattering in the far-field. The
obtained solutions involve the angle of incidence, the modal coefficients of
the scatterer and its image, and the particle-wall distance. Computations are
considered, and calculations exemplify the analysis with emphasis on changing
the particle size, the particle-wall distance and the angle of incidence. It is
found that the object experiences either an attractive or repulsive force
directed toward or away from the boundary. Moreover, it reverses its rotation
around its center of mass depending on its size, particle-wall distance and
angle of incidence. Furthermore, radiation force and torque singularities occur
(i.e., zero force and torque) such that the cylinder becomes irresponsive to
the linear and angular momenta transfer yielded by the effective field. The
exact formalism presented here using the multipole expansion method, which is
valid for any frequency range, could be used to validate other approaches using
purely numerical methods, or frequency-limiting approximate models such as the
Rayleigh and the Kirchhoff regimes.
