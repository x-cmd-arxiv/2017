subject of renewed interest since the discovery of the interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). This antisymmetric exchange
interaction selects a given chirality for the spin textures and allows
stabilising configurations with nontrivial topology. Moreover, it has many
crucial consequences on the dynamical properties of these topological
structures, including chiral domain walls (DWs) and magnetic skyrmions. In the
recent years the study of noncollinear spin textures has been extended from
single ultrathin layers to magnetic multilayers with broken inversion symmetry.
This extension of the structures in the vertical dimension allows very
efficient current-induced motion and room-temperature stability for both N\'eel
DWs and skyrmions. Here we show how in such multilayered systems the interlayer
interactions can actually lead to more complex, hybrid chiral magnetisation
arrangements. The described thickness-dependent reorientation of DWs is
experimentally confirmed by studying demagnetised multilayers through circular
dichroism in x-ray resonant magnetic scattering. We also demonstrate a simple
yet reliable method for determining the magnitude of the DMI from static
domains measurements even in the presence of these hybrid chiral structures, by
taking into account the actual profile of the DWs. The advent of these novel
hybrid chiral textures has far-reaching implications on how to stabilise and
manipulate DWs as well as skymionic structures in magnetic multilayers.

scattered from a two-dimensional randomly rough isotropic or anisotropic
Dirichlet or Neumann surface when it is illuminated by a scalar Gaussian beam.
The integral equations for the scattering amplitudes are solved
nonperturbatively by a rigorous computer simulation approach. The results of
these calculations are used to calculate the full angular distribution of the
mean differential reflection coefficient. For isotropic surfaces, the results
of the present calculations for in-plane scattering are compared with those of
earlier studies of this problem. The reflectivities of Dirichlet and Neumann
surfaces are calculated as functions of the polar angle of incidence, and the
reflectiveties for the two kinds of surfaces of similar roughness parameters
are found to be different. For an increasing level of surface anisotropy, we
study how the angular intensity distributions of the scattered waves are
affected by this level. We find that even small to moderate levels of surface
anisotropy can significantly alter the symmetry, shape, and amplitude of the
scattered intensity distributions when Gaussian beams are incident on the
anisotropic surfaces from different azimuthal angles of incidence.

designed by human programmers. We used ""existing controls"" corresponding to
near-optimal solutions and built refinement models to more accurately relate a
system's dynamics to its performance. A mechanism that mostly influences ATN
performance is Empty Vehicle Management (EVM). The algorithms designed by human
programmers was used: calls to empty vehicles for waiting passengers and
balancing based on reallocation of empty vehicles to achieve better regularity
of their settlement. In this paper we discuss how we can improve these
algorithms (and tune them to current conditions) by using ML to tailor
individual behavioral policies. Using ML techniques was possible because our
algorithm is based on a set of parameters. A number of weights and thresholds
could be tuned up to give better decisions on moving empty vehicles across the

monoxide (SO), a known shock tracer, in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk. Two
rotational transitions: $J=7_{7}-6_{6}$ (301.286 GHz) and $J=7_8-6_7$ (304.078
GHz) are detected in their respective integrated intensity maps. The stacking
of these transitions results in a clear 5$\sigma$ detection in the stacked line
profile. The emission is compact but is spectrally resolved and the line
profile has two components. One component peaks at the source velocity and the
other is blue-shifted by 5 km s$^{-1}$. The kinematics and spatial distribution
of the SO emission are not consistent with that expected from a purely
Keplerian disk. We detect additional blue-shifted emission that we attribute to
a disk wind. The disk component was simulated using LIME and a physical disk
structure. The disk emission is asymmetric and best fit by a wedge of emission
in the north east region of the disk coincident with a `hot-spot' observed in
the CO $J=3-2$ line. The favoured hypothesis is that a possible inner disk warp
(seen in CO emission) directly exposes the north-east side of the disk to
heating by the central star, creating locally the conditions to launch a disk
wind. Chemical models of a disk wind will help to elucidate why the wind is
particularly highlighted in SO emission and whether a refractory source of
sulphur is needed. An alternative explanation is that the SO is tracing an
accretion shock from a circumplanetary disk associated with the proposed
protoplanet embedded in the disk at 50 au. We also report a non-detection of SO
in the protoplanetary disk around HD 97048.

mechanical model of relevance to the emergence of polarisation from local

ingredients: a Kitaev-like orientation-dependent interaction between nearest
neighbours, and a steric term that acts between next-nearest neighbours. Taken
by themselves, each of these two ingredients is incapable of driving long-range
symmetry breaking, despite the presence of a broad feature in the corresponding
heat capacity functions. Instead each component results in a ""hidden""
transition on cooling to a manifold of degenerate states, the two manifolds are
different in the sense that they reflect distinct types of local order.
Remarkably, their intersection---\emph{i.e.} the ground state when both
interaction terms are included in the Hamiltonian---supports a spontaneous
polarisation. In this way, our study demonstrates how local ordering mechanisms
might be combined to break global inversion symmetry in a manner conceptually
similar to that operating in the ""hybrid"" improper ferroelectrics. We discuss
the relevance of our analysis to the emergence of spontaneous polarisation in
well-studied ferroelectrics such as BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$.

abstraction refinement for control synthesis of a nonlinear system associated

of the cells of this partition to visit at each sampling time. The dynamics are
decomposed into subsystems where some states and inputs are not observed, some
states are observed but not controlled and where assume-guarantee obligations
are used on the uncontrolled states of each subsystem. A finite abstraction is
created for each subsystem through a refinement procedure starting from a
coarse partition of the state space, then proceeding backwards on the
specification sequence to iteratively split the elements of the partition whose
coarseness prevents the satisfaction of the specification. Each refined
abstraction is associated with a controller and it is proved that combining
these local controllers can enforce the specification on the original system.
The efficiency of the proposed approach compared to other abstraction methods
is illustrated in a numerical example.

Workload awareness, defined as a detailed full range understanding of each

critical to perform an accurate analysis to determine which workloads are
appropriate for on-premise deployment versus which workloads can be migrated to
a cloud off-premise, the assessment is mainly performed by rule or policy based
approaches. In this paper, we introduce StackInsights, a novel cognitive system
to automatically analyze and predict the cloud readiness of workloads for an
enterprise. Our system harnesses the critical metrics across the entire stack:
1) infrastructure metrics, 2) data relevance metrics, and 3) application
taxonomy, to identify workloads that have characteristics of a) low sensitivity
with respect to business security, criticality and compliance, and b) low
response time requirements and access patterns. Since the capture of the data
relevance metrics involves an intrusive and in-depth scanning of the content of
storage objects, a machine learning model is applied to perform the business
relevance classification by learning from the meta level metrics harnessed
across stack. In contrast to traditional methods, StackInsights significantly
reduces the total time for hybrid cloud readiness assessment by orders of

robots are considered by providing an analytic safety constraint using
generalized $L_p$ norms. For regular cuboid robots, level sets of weighted
$L_p$ norms generate implicit approximations of their surfaces. For bendable
cuboid robots a weighted $L_p$ norm in polar coordinates implicitly
approximates the surface boundary through a specified level set. Obstacle
volumes, in the environment to navigate within, are presumed to be
approximately described as sub-level sets of weighted $L_p$ norms. Using these
approximate surface models, the optimal safe path planning problem is
reformulated as a two stage optimization problem, where the safety constraint
depends on a point on the robot which is closest to the obstacle in the
obstacle's distance metric. A set of equality and inequality constraints are
derived to replace the closest point problem, which is then defines additional
analytic constraints on the original path planning problem. Combining all the
analytic constraints with logical AND operations leads to a general optimal
safe path planning problem. Numerically solving the problem involve conversion
to a nonlinear programing problem. Simulations for rigid and bendable cuboid
robot verify the proposed method.

perturbative approach. For a scale-invariant classical theory the scalar
potential is computed at three-loop level while keeping manifest this symmetry.
Spontaneous scale symmetry breaking is transmitted at quantum level to the
visible sector (of $\phi$) by the associated Goldstone mode (dilaton $\sigma$)
which enables a scale-invariant regularisation and whose vev
$\langle\sigma\rangle$ generates the subtraction scale ($\mu$). While the
hidden ($\sigma$) and visible sector ($\phi$) are classically decoupled in
$d=4$ due to an enhanced Poincar\'e symmetry, they interact through (a series
of) evanescent couplings $\propto\epsilon^k$, ($k\geq 1$), dictated by the
scale invariance of the action in $d=4-2\epsilon$. At the quantum level these
couplings generate new corrections to the potential, such as scale-invariant
non-polynomial effective operators $\phi^{2n+4}/\sigma^{2n}$ and also log-like
terms ($\propto \ln^k \sigma$) restoring the scale-invariance of known quantum
corrections. The former are comparable in size to ""standard"" loop corrections
and important for values of $\phi$ close to $\langle\sigma\rangle$. For $n=1,2$
the beta functions of their coefficient are computed at three-loops. In the
infrared (IR) limit the dilaton fluctuations decouple, the effective operators
are suppressed by large $\langle\sigma\rangle$ and the effective potential
becomes that of a renormalizable theory with explicit scale symmetry breaking

Despite of having achieved tremendous success over numerical domains, existing

programs based on separation logic. The essence of our proposal is
context-sensitive lazy initialization, a novel approach for efficient test
input generation. Our approach differs from existing approaches in two ways.
Firstly, our approach is based on separation logic, which allows us to
precisely capture preconditions of heap-based programs so that we avoid
generating invalid test inputs. Secondly, we generate only fully initialized
test inputs, which are more useful in practice compared to those partially
initialized test inputs generated by the state-of-the-art tools. We have
implemented our approach as a tool, called Java StarFinder, and evaluated it on
a set of programs with complex heap inputs. The results show that our approach
significantly reduces the number of invalid test inputs and improves the test

the new physics of high $T_c$ superconductors made of complex quantum matter.
Today the standard model of high $T_c$ superconductivity which grabs the
physics of complex quantum matter is the multi-band Hubbard model where the
dome of $T_c$ occurs by driving the chemical potential in the proximity of a
topological Lifshitz transition. The multi-gap superconductivity in the $T_c$
dome is driven by exchange interaction between a condensate in the BEC-BCS
crossover which coexists with second BCS condensates. The proximity to Lifshitz
transitions in correlated electronic systems gives the ubiquitous arrested
phase separation observed in all high temperature superconductors. Non
Euclidean filamentary hyperbolic geometry is needed for the space description
of superstripes textures produced by the coexistence of short range CDW
puddles, hole poor SDW puddles and self organized dopants rich puddles. A road
map to room temperature superconductors in particular organic compounds made of
superlattices of quantum wires driven by Fano resonances with one of the
condensates in the BEC-BCS crossover has been proposed.

challenge, as exemplified by extraordinary large laser facilities. Fast
isochoric heating of a pre-compressed plasma core with a high-intensity
short-pulse laser is an attractive and alternative approach to create
ultra-high-energy-density states like those found in ICF ignition sparks. This
avoids the ignition quench caused by the hot spark mixing with the surrounding
cold fuel, which is the crucial problem of the currently pursued ignition
scheme. High-intensity lasers efficiently produce relativistic electron beams
(REB). A part of the REB kinetic energy is deposited in the core, and then the
heated region becomes the hot spark to trigger the ignition. However, only a
small portion of the REB collides with the core because of its large
divergence. Here we have demonstrated enhanced laser-to-core energy coupling
with the magnetized fast isochoric heating. The method employs a
kilo-tesla-level magnetic field that is applied to the transport region from
the REB generation point to the core which results in guiding the REB along the
magnetic field lines to the core. 7.7 $\pm$ 1.3 % of the maximum coupling was
achieved even with a relatively small radial area density core ($\rho R$ $\sim$
0.1 g/cm$^2$). The guided REB transport was clearly visualized in a
pre-compressed core by using Cu-$K_\alpha$ imaging technique. A simplified
model coupled with the comprehensive diagnostics yields 6.2\% of the coupling
that agrees fairly with the measured coupling. This model also reveals that an
ignition-scale areal density core ($\rho R$ $\sim$ 0.4 g/cm$^2$) leads to much
higher laser-to-core coupling ($>$ 15%), this is much higher than that achieved
by the current scheme.

Shpilka and Volk showed that for binary Reed-Muller codes of length $n$ and
distance $d = O(1)$, one can correct $\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ random errors
in $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time (which is well beyond the worst-case error
tolerance of $O(1)$).
  In this paper, we consider the problem of `syndrome decoding' Reed-Muller
codes from random errors. More specifically, given the
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$-bit long syndrome vector of a codeword corrupted in
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ random coordinates, we would like to compute the
locations of the codeword corruptions. This problem turns out to be equivalent
to a basic question about computing tensor decomposition of random low-rank
tensors over finite fields.
  Our main result is that syndrome decoding of Reed-Muller codes (and the
equivalent tensor decomposition problem) can be solved efficiently, i.e., in
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ time. We give two algorithms for this problem:
  1. The first algorithm is a finite field variant of a classical algorithm for
tensor decomposition over real numbers due to Jennrich. This also gives an
alternate proof for the main result of Saptharishi et al.
  2. The second algorithm is obtained by implementing the steps of the
Berlekamp-Welch-style decoding algorithm of Saptharishi et al. in
sublinear-time. The main new ingredient is an algorithm for solving certain

computational cost of such searches in low latency will grow dramatically as
the low frequency sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors improves.
Convolutional neural networks provide a highly computationally efficient method
for signal identification in which the majority of calculations are performed
prior to data taking during a training process. We use only whitened time
series of measured gravitational-wave strain as an input, and we train and test
on simulated binary black hole signals in synthetic Gaussian noise
representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. We show that our network can
classify signal from noise with a performance that emulates that of match
filtering applied to the same datasets when considering the sensitivity defined
by Reciever-Operator characteristics.

multiple stable states. While each of these states is generally resilient,
certain perturbations such as antibiotics, probiotics and diet shifts, result
in transitions to other states. Can we reliably both predict such stable states
as well as direct and control transitions between them? Here we present a new
conceptual model inspired by the stable marriage problem in game theory and
economics in which microbial communities naturally exhibit multiple stable
states, each state with a different species' abundance profile. Our model's
core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while
competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables, one with microbes'
nutrient preferences and one with their competitive abilities, we can determine
all possible stable states as well as predict inter-state transitions,
triggered by the removal or addition of a specific nutrient or microbe.
Further, using an example of 7 Bacteroides species common to the human gut
utilizing 9 polysaccharides, we predict that mutual complementarity in nutrient
preferences enables these species to coexist at high abundances.

its bottom face is at either $0.5L$ or $0.25L$ below the undisturbed water
surface, the water surface profile behaviors are basically similar with a
nearly circular arc forming between the water contact point on the front face
of the cube and the wave crest. As the impact proceeds, this arc shrinks to
zero size and creates a fast-moving vertical jet in a manner similar to that
found in previous studies of wave impact on bottom-mounted vertical walls. In
the case where the cube is one quarter submerged, a small jet also forms at the
crest and impacts the front face of the cube just before the circular arc
reaches zero size. When the bottom of the cube is located at the undisturbed
water level the wave impact is dramatically different. In this case, it appears
that a packet of air is entrapped during the impact and the surface pressure
subsequently oscillates with a frequency of about 2,000 Hz.

two initial states are differed only by a local perturbation. To be entitled
""chaos"" the distance should have a rapid growth afterwards. Instead of focusing
on the entire wave function, we measure the distance $d^2(t)$ by investigating
the difference of two reduced density matrices of the subsystem $A$ that is
spatially separated from the local perturbation. This distance $d^2(t)$ grows
with time and eventually saturates to a small constant. We interpret the
distance growth in terms of operator scrambling picture, which relates $d^2(t)$
to the square of commutator $C(t)$ (out-of-time-order correlator) and shows
that both these quantities measure the area of the operator wave front in
subsystem $A$. Among various one-dimensional spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models, we
numerically show that the models with non-local power-law interaction can have
an exponentially growing regime in $d^2(t)$ when the local perturbation and
subsystem $A$ are well separated. This regime is absent in the
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with local interaction only. After sufficiently long
time evolution, $d^2(t)$ relaxes to a small constant, which decays
exponentially as we increase the system size and is consistent with eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis. Based on these results, we demonstrate that $d^2(t)$
is a useful quantity to characterize both quantum chaos and quantum
thermalization in many-body wave functions.

magnetic moment $a_e$ we have carried out a new numerical evaluation of the 389
integrals of Set V, which represent 6,354 Feynman vertex diagrams without
lepton loops. During this work, we found that one of the integrals, called
$X024$, was given a wrong value in the previous calculation due to an incorrect
assignment of integration variables. The correction of this error causes a
shift of $-1.25$ to the Set~V contribution, and hence to the tenth-order
universal (i.e., mass-independent) term $ A_1^{(10)}$. The previous evaluation
of all other 388 integrals is free from errors and consistent with the new
evaluation. Combining the new and the old (excluding $X024$) calculations
statistically, we obtain $7.606~(192) (\alpha/\pi)^5$ as the best estimate of
the Set V contribution. Including the contribution of the diagrams with fermion
loops, the improved tenth-order universal term becomes
$A_1^{(10)}=6.678~(192)$. Adding hadronic and electroweak contributions leads
to the theoretical prediction $a_e (\text{theory})
=1~159~652~182.032~(720)\times 10^{-12}$. From this and the best measurement of
$a_e$, we obtain the inverse fine-structure constant $\alpha^{-1}(a_e) =

  arXiv:1803.00651",,,,"cs.IT cs.CV math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we study the robust subspace tracking (RST) problem and obtain
one of the first two provable guarantees for it. The goal of RST is to track
sequentially arriving data vectors that lie in a slowly changing
low-dimensional subspace, while being robust to corruption by additive sparse
outliers. It can also be interpreted as a dynamic (time-varying) extension of
robust PCA (RPCA), with the minor difference that RST also requires a short
tracking delay. We develop a recursive projected compressive sensing algorithm
that we call Nearly Optimal RST via ReProCS (ReProCS-NORST) because its
tracking delay is nearly optimal. We prove that NORST solves both the RST and
the dynamic RPCA problems under weakened standard RPCA assumptions, two simple
extra assumptions (slow subspace change and most outlier magnitudes lower
bounded), and a few minor assumptions.
  Our guarantee shows that NORST enjoys a near optimal tracking delay of $O(r
\log n \log(1/\epsilon))$. Its required delay between subspace change times is
the same, and its memory complexity is $n$ times this value. Thus both these
are also nearly optimal. Here $n$ is the ambient space dimension, $r$ is the
subspaces' dimension, and $\epsilon$ is the tracking accuracy. NORST also has
the best outlier tolerance compared with all previous RPCA or RST methods, both
theoretically and empirically (including for real videos), without requiring
any model on how the outlier support is generated. This is possible because of
the extra assumptions it uses.

modeling of wave propagation through folded channels, not introducing effective
theory assumptions. As a result, we reveal that metastructures with channels,
which allow wave propagation in the opposite direction to incident waves, have
different dynamics as compared to those for straight slits of equivalent
length. The differences are attributed to activated tortuosity effects and
result in 100% wave reflection at band gap frequencies. This total reflection
phenomenon is found to be insensitive to thermo-viscous dissipation in air. For
labyrinthine channels generated by iteration levels, one can achieve broadband
total sound reflection by using a metamaterial monolayer and efficiently
control the amount of absorbed wave energy by tuning the channel width. Thus,
the work contributes to a better understanding of labyrinthine metamaterials
with potential applications for reflection and filtering of low-frequency
airborne sound.

whose map is composition of failure rule with control actions. Supply-demand at
the nodes is monotonically non-increasing under admissible control. Under the
failure rule, a link is removed permanently if its flow exceeds capacity
constraints. We consider finite horizon optimal control to steer the network
from an arbitrary initial state, defined in terms of active link set and
supply-demand at the nodes, to a feasible state, i.e., a state which is
invariant under the failure rule. There is no running cost and the reward
associated with a feasible terminal state is the associated cumulative
supply-demand. We propose two approaches for computing optimal control. The
first approach, geared towards tree reducible networks, decomposes the global
problem into a system of coupled local problems, which can be solved to
optimality in two iterations. When restricted to the class of one-shot control
actions, the optimal solutions to the local problems possess a piecewise affine
property, which facilitates analytical solution. The second approach computes
optimal control by searching over the reachable set, which is shown to admit an
equivalent finite representation by aggregation of control actions leading to
the same reachable active link set. An algorithmic procedure to construct this
representation is provided by leveraging and extending tools for arrangement of
hyperplanes and polytopes. Illustrative simulations, including showing the
effectiveness of a projection-based approximation algorithm, are also

that gas is heated over large scales by feedback from active galactic nuclei

well-separated galaxies. In this Letter, the metal line absorption catalogue of
Zhu & Menard (2013) is used to probe gas out to large projected radii around a

photometric redshifts in the range 0.4<z<0.8 selected from Sloan Digital Sky

the red low mass galaxies compared to their blue counterparts out to projected
radii of 10 Mpc. In addition, the equivalent width distribution function of
MgII absorbers around low mass galaxies is shown to be strongly affected by the
presence of a nearby (R_p<2 Mpc) radio-loud AGN out to projected radii of 5
Mpc.

HDM to evaluate the interparticle interactions instead of popular CDM, and
propose a pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann model based on

of the pseudopotential model, such as easy implementation, high efficiency,
full parallelism and so on, but also achieves higher accuracies. To verify the
performances of this model, several multiphase flow simulations are conducted,
including both stationary and dynamic situations. Firstly, full thermodynamic
consistencies for the popular equations of state have been achieved in large
temperature range and at large density ratio, without any combining interaction
and any additional adjustable parameter of interaction. Secondly, with
high-order difference, either the interparticle interaction proposed by
Shan-Chen or by Zhang-Chen can equally depict the phase transitions of the
fluids with all selected equations of the state. These numerical agreements
based on HDM are consistent to the theoretical analysis that the two models are
mathematically identical. Thirdly, the present model is stable and accurate at
a wider temperature range. Lastly, our newly proposed model can be easily and
reliably applied to various practical simulations and expected to obtain some

that expansion, up to sixth order, may be expressed analytically in terms of
Riemann zeta functions and roots of Bessel functions. This report builds on
that work with three main contributions: (1) compelling numerical evidence
independently supporting those published results, (2) a conjecture adding two
more terms to the asymptotic expansion, and (3) an observation that
higher-order coefficients both alternate in sign and grow rapidly in magnitude,

appeared to exhibit higher nuclear radio luminosities than non-masing Seyfert
2s (Zhang et al. 2012). This has been confirmed by our follow-up study on
multi-band (11, 6, 3.6, 2, 1.3 cm) radio properties of maser host Seyfert 2s,
through systematic Effelsberg observations (Liu et al. 2017). The nuclear radio
luminosity was supposed to be a suitable indicator to guide future AGN maser
searches. Thus we performed a pilot survey with the Effelsberg telescope on H2O
maser emission toward a small sample of radio-bright Seyfert 2 galaxies with
relatively higher redshift (>0.04). Our pilot survey led to one new megamaser
source and one additional possible detection, which reflects our success in
selecting H2O megamaser candidates compared to previous observations (higher
detection rate, larger distance). Our successful selection technique choosing
Seyfert 2s with radio-bright nuclei may provide good guiding for future H2O
megamaser surveys. Therefore we are conducting a large systematic survey toward
a big Seyfert 2 sample with such radio-bright nuclei. Detections of luminous
H2O masers at large distance (z>0.04) may hold the great potential to increase
our knowledge on the central highly obscured but still very enigmatic regions
of active Seyfert galaxies (Zhang et al. 2017).

promising directions for reaching higher levels of artificial intelligence.
Among the other achievements, building computers that understand speech
represents a crucial leap towards intelligent machines. Despite the great
efforts of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech
interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially when users interact
with a distant microphone in noisy and reverberant environments. The latter
disturbances severely hamper the intelligibility of a speech signal, making
Distant Speech Recognition (DSR) one of the major open challenges in the field.
  This thesis addresses the latter scenario and proposes some novel techniques,
architectures, and algorithms to improve the robustness of distant-talking
acoustic models. We first elaborate on methodologies for realistic data
contamination, with a particular emphasis on DNN training with simulated data.
We then investigate on approaches for better exploiting speech contexts,
proposing some original methodologies for both feed-forward and recurrent
neural networks. Lastly, inspired by the idea that cooperation across different
DNNs could be the key for counteracting the harmful effects of noise and
reverberation, we propose a novel deep learning paradigm called network of deep
neural networks. The analysis of the original concepts were based on extensive
experimental validations conducted on both real and simulated data, considering
different corpora, microphone configurations, environments, noisy conditions,

in the past few years. However, being supervised, these SR methods are
restricted to specific training data, where the acquisition of the
low-resolution (LR) images from their high-resolution (HR) counterparts is
predetermined (e.g., bicubic downscaling), without any distracting artifacts
(e.g., sensor noise, image compression, non-ideal PSF, etc). Real LR images,
however, rarely obey these restrictions, resulting in poor SR results by SotA
(State of the Art) methods. In this paper we introduce ""Zero-Shot"" SR, which
exploits the power of Deep Learning, but does not rely on prior training. We
exploit the internal recurrence of information inside a single image, and train
a small image-specific CNN at test time, on examples extracted solely from the
input image itself. As such, it can adapt itself to different settings per
image. This allows to perform SR of real old photos, noisy images, biological
data, and other images where the acquisition process is unknown or non-ideal.
On such images, our method outperforms SotA CNN-based SR methods, as well as
previous unsupervised SR methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first unsupervised CNN-based SR method.

others continuous distributions. Even though the structure (i.e., bimodal vs.

not seem to have very different photometric properties, agreeing with

domain. The equation is discretized as an indefinite linear system, which is
difficult to solve at high wave numbers. In many applications, the solution of
the Helmholtz equation is required for a point source. In this case, it is
possible to reformulate the equation as two separate equations: one for the
travel time of the wave and one for its amplitude. The travel time is obtained
by a solution of the factored eikonal equation, and the amplitude is obtained
by solving a complex-valued advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation. The
reformulated equation is equivalent to the original Helmholtz equation, and the
differences between the numerical solutions of these equations arise only from
discretization errors. We develop an efficient multigrid solver for obtaining
the amplitude given the travel time, which can be efficiently computed. This
approach is advantageous because the amplitude is typically smooth in this
case, and hence, more suitable for multigrid solvers than the standard
Helmholtz discretization. We demonstrate that our second order ADR
discretization is more accurate than the standard second order discretization
at high wave numbers, as long as there are no reflections or caustics.
Moreover, we show that using our approach, the problem can be solved more
efficiently than using the common shifted Laplacian multigrid approach.

constructed a simple and mathematically transparent quantum theory of the
Coulomb field, predicting (among other things) a relation between the theory of

performed a more careful analysis of free fields including the mass less free
gauge fields, such as the electromagnetic potential field, their Wick and
chronological products, which revealed the need for a more careful and white
noise construction of these fields, and which opened a way to resolve IR
problems (at least those which shows up at each order separately). Comparison

plasma waves (SPWs) and raised the prospect of using it to create lossless
SPWs. The counter-intuitive nature of this finding prompts one to ask, why had
not this instability been disclosed before, given the long history of this
subject? If this instability does exist, how far is it from reality? The
present work is devoted to answering these questions. To this end, we derive a
unified macroscopic theory of SPWs that applies to any type of electron
dynamics, be they local or non-local, classical or quantum-mechanical. In light
of this theory, we analyze the behaviors of SPWs according to several electron
dynamics models, including the widely used local dielectric model (DM), the
hydrodynamic model (HDM) and the specular reflection model (SRM), in addition
to the less common semi-classical model (SCM). We find that, in order to unveil
the instability, one must (i) self-consistently treat surface effects without
any of the usually imposed auxiliary conditions and (ii) include translation
symmetry breaking effects in electron dynamics. As far as we are concerned,
none existing work had fulfilled both (i) and (ii). To assess the possibility
of realizing the instability, we analyze two very important factors: the
dielectric interfacing the metal and inter-band transitions, which both were
ignored in our recent work. Whereas inter-band absorption -- together with
Landau damping -- is shown adverse to the instability, a dielectric brings it

accurate location and inventory of wayside track assets like traffic signals,

Positive Train Control (PTC) regulation coming into effect, many railway safety
rules will be tied directly to location of assets like mileposts and signals.
Newer speed regulations will be enforced based on location of the Train with
respect to a wayside asset. Hence it is essential for the railroads to have an
accurate database of the types and locations of these assets. This paper talks
about a real-world use-case of detecting railway signals from a camera mounted
on a moving locomotive and tracking their locations. The camera is engineered
to withstand the environment factors on a moving train and provide a consistent
steady image at around 30 frames per second. Using advanced image analysis and
deep learning techniques, signals are detected in these camera images and a
database of their locations is created. Railway signals differ a lot from road
signals in terms of shapes and rules for placement with respect to track. Due
to space constraint and traffic densities in urban areas signals are not placed
on the same side of the track and multiple lines can run in parallel. Hence
there is need to associate signal detected with the track on which the train
runs. We present a method to associate the signals to the specific track they
belong to using a video feed from the front facing camera mounted on the lead
locomotive. A pipeline of track detection, region of interest selection, signal
detection has been implemented which gives an overall accuracy of 94.7% on a

transforms into a momentum- dependent magnetic field, namely, a spin-orbit
field (SOF). SOFs are of great use in spintronics because they enable spin
manipulation via the electric field. At the same time, however, spintronic
applications are severely limited by the SOF, as electrons traversing the SOF
easily lose their spin information. Here, we propose that in-plane
ferroelectricity in (001)-oriented SnTe thin films harness the Janus-faced SOF
in a reconcilable way to enable electrical spin controllability and suppress
spin dephasing. The in-plane ferroelectricity produces a unidirectional
out-of-plane Rashba SOF that can host a long-lived helical spin mode known as a
persistent spin helix (PSH). Through direct coupling between the inversion
asymmetry and the SOF, the ferroelectric switching reverses the out-of-plane
Rashba SOF, giving rise to a maximally field-tunable PSH. Furthermore, the
giant out- of-plane Rashba SOF seen in the SnTe thin films is linked to the
nano-sized PSH, potentially reducing spintronic device sizes to the nanoscale.
We combine the two ferroelectric-coupled degrees of freedom, longitudinal
charge and transverse PSH, to design intersectional electro-spintronic
transistors governed by non-volatile ferroelectric switching within nanoscale
lateral and atomic-thick vertical dimensions.

Consequently, the super-resolver can handle multiple and even spatially variant
degradations, which significantly improves the practicability. Extensive
experimental results on synthetic and real LR images show that the proposed

regimes of plastic smoothing and formation of wear particles in a contact of
homogeneous sliding bodies. However, he did not consider any detailed mechanism
of either plastic smoothing or debris formation. In a recent paper in Nature
Communications, Molinari et al. have confirmed the criterion using explicit
mesoparticle simulation. The work of Molinari's group provides a strong support
to the general concept of Rabinowicz which is based on the consideration of
competition of plastic deformation and fracture. It is interesting to apply
this concept to more general configurations than those considered by Rabinowicz
and Molinari's group. An important case is a system having a very soft surface
layer. In the present paper, the analysis similar to that of Rabinowicz is
applied to materials with soft layer. It is shown that in this case, too, both
cases of plastic deformation and debris formation may occur. It would be
interesting to verify this prediction by explicit meso-particle simulations
similar to those of Molinari's group.

a simple law of mixtures. Further, we use samples with a specific periodic

of material behaviour, this results in two neatly separated regimes where the
deformation is averaged throughout the length in the first regime, and highly
localised in the later regime. This allows us to disentangle the two types of

terms of similarities between each other, rather than in terms of feature
vectors. In these settings, machine-learning algorithms can become very
computationally demanding, as they may require matching the test samples
against a very large set of reference prototypes. To mitigate this issue,
different approaches have been developed to reduce the number of required
reference prototypes. Current reduction approaches select a small subset of
representative prototypes in the space induced by the similarity measure, and
then separately train the classification function on the reduced subset.
However, decoupling these two steps may not allow reducing the number of
prototypes effectively without compromising accuracy. We overcome this
limitation by jointly learning the classification function along with an
optimal set of virtual prototypes, whose number can be either fixed a priori or
optimized according to application-specific criteria. Creating a super-sparse
set of virtual prototypes provides much sparser solutions, drastically reducing
complexity at test time, at the expense of a slightly increased complexity
during training. A much smaller set of prototypes also results in
easier-to-interpret decisions. We empirically show that our approach can reduce
up to ten times the complexity of Support Vector Machines, LASSO and ridge
regression at test time, without almost affecting their classification
accuracy.

adhesion, capillarity, and superhydrophobicity) are discussed. Friction
involves paradoxes, such as the Painlev\'e paradoxes of non-existence or
non-uniqueness of solutions in mechanical systems of rigid bodies with dry
friction. These paradoxes can be treated by introducing ternary logic with the
three basic states: rest-motion-undefined. When elastic deformation is
introduced, the paradoxical solutions correspond to frictional instabilities
leading to rest-motion-unstable as three states of a system. The dynamic
evolution of a frictional interface towards a limit cycle can be viewed as a
process of erasing the information about the interface due to the
instabilities. Furthermore, while friction force is universal, it is not
treated as a fundamental force and can be considered as an epiphenomenon of
various synergetic mechanisms. This further relates friction to other surface
effects, including the capillarity, with its binary logic of wetting states and
a possibility of droplet computation for lab-on-a-chip microfluidic reactors.
We discuss the logical foundation of biomimetic superhydrophobic surface design
and how it is different from the conventional design. Both friction and wetting
can be used for novel unconventional logical and computational devices.
